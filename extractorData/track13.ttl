However, after being approached by the drama's executive producer, Zetty Adila Ramli, he finally agreed to write a lyric based on the script that was given to him and before later releasing it as a proper song. To promote the song, Hafiz first performed a single version of the song at Astro's Iftar and Eid-ul-Fitr screening ceremony on 1 August 2012 . Siti on the other hand first performed the song as a single version at her 2012 concert in Gambang on 11 November. The duo later performed the song together live for the first time six days later at the 19th Anugerah Industri Muzik on 17 November 2012.

	dbo:abstract	"\"The Last Time\" is a song by the English rock band The Rolling Stones, and the band's first single written by Mick Jagger and Keith Richards. Recorded at RCA Studios in Hollywood, California in January 1965, \"The Last Time\" was the band's third UK single to reach No. 1 in the UK Singles Chart, spending three weeks at the top in March and early April 1965. It reached No.2 in the Irish Singles Chart in March 1965. Although The Last Time is credited to Jagger/Richards, the song's refrain is very close to \"This May Be The Last Time\", a 1958 track by The Staple Singers. In 2003, Richards acknowledged this, saying: \"we came up with 'The Last Time', which was basically re-adapting a traditional gospel song that had been sung by the Staple Singers, but luckily the song itself goes back into the mists of time.\" The Rolling Stones' song has a main melody and a hook (a distinctive guitar riff) that were both absent in the Staple Singers' version. Footage still exists of a number of performances of this song by the Rolling Stones in 1965: from the popular BBC-TV music show Top of the Pops, the 1965 New Musical Express Poll Winners Concert and American TV shows including The Ed Sullivan Show, Shindig! and The Hollywood Palace. A full live performance is also prominently featured in the 2012 re-edit of the 1965 documentary Charlie Is My Darling. The footage confirms that the rhythm chords and guitar solo were played by Keith Richards, while the song's distinctive hook was played by Brian Jones, suggesting that Jones may have composed that riff. A popular song in the Stones' canon, it was regularly performed in concert during the band's 1965, 1966 and 1967 tours. It was then left off their concert set lists until 1997-98, when it reappeared on the Bridges to Babylon Tour. It would later appear on some of the band's setlists in 2012-13 on the 50 & Counting tour."@en ;

The working title was \"Monkey, Zulu\". The single included an edited version (at 4:32) and the first part of \"Domino\" (\"In the Glow of the Night\") as the B-side. A new edit of the single version was released on the 1999 compilation Turn It On Again: The Hits (as well as its \"sequel\" The Tour Edition) and later on The Platinum Collection. This revised edit features a different cross fade and different edit points as compared to the original 1987 edit version. Some singles that included the full version of the song included the second part of \"Domino\" (\"The Last Domino\") as the B-side. Other releases contained the song \"Paperlate\" and a 12\" remix of \"Tonight, Tonight, Tonight\". The full live version from the Live at Wembley Stadium video was included as a B-side on the \"Tell Me Why\" CD single. The song was performed during concerts in support of Invisible Touch. A shorter version (which segued into \"Invisible Touch\") was played on the We Can't Dance and Turn It On Again tours, albeit transposed down a key to account for the deepening of Phil Collins' voice."@en ;

The song was first mentioned by Chris Van de Geer at Stellar's official message board in April 2005 as having been a track that was almost complete. It was also mentioned as a possible single for the album. However, in a later post by Chris in December he stated that the song had recently almost completely re-recorded and was set for release. The song was compared to Scottish blues rock band Texas' style by the New Zealand Herald."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"All Nite (Don't Stop)\" is a song recorded by American recording artist Janet Jackson for her eighth studio album, Damita Jo (2004). It was written and produced by Jackson and Swedish duo BAG & Arnthor, with additional writing from Jam and Lewis. \"All Nite (Don't Stop)\" fuses R&B and dance-pop with influences of electro pop, funk, and house. It uses varied instrumentation, such as funk guitars, with samba, grime, and latin music. Jackson sings the song in a breathy falsetto, with lyrical metaphors comparing various actions to the addictive nature and persuasion of dancing. \"All Nite (Don't Stop)\" was released May 29, 2004 by Virgin Records as the third single from Damita Jo. \"All Nite (Don't Stop)\" received positive reviews from music critics, who praised it as the best on the album. The song's chart performance was massively affected by the blacklisting of Jackson's singles and music videos on many radio formats and music channels worldwide, regarding conglomerates fined by the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) after her controversial Super Bowl halftime show incident. However, it peaked atop Hot Dance Club Songs and reached number eight on Hot Dance Airplay; peaked within the top twenty in the United Kingdom and charted within numerous other countries. It additionally won a BMI London Award for Best Pop Song. Its music video, directed by Francis Lawrence, portrays Jackson and her dancers rehearsing in an abandoned hotel during a power outage. The music video received nominations for Best Dance Video at the International Dance Music Awards and Best Choreography at the MVPA Awards. Jackson performed \"All Nite (Don't Stop)\" during several appearances in order to promote the album, including Saturday Night Live, On Air with Ryan Seacrest and Top of the Pops, in addition to the 2004 Video Music Awards Japan and her 2008 Rock Witchu Tour."@en ;

It was written by Jules Shear for his album Watch Dog, as a mid-tempo folk-rock song. After The Cars recorded their own version, which they did not use on any of their albums, Lauper decided to cover it. Although she initially intended to do a straight cover of Shear's version, she turned it into a pop ballad instead. The song was the only single released worldwide by Lauper that did not have a music video. It peaked at number five on the Billboard Hot 100, becoming Lauper's fourth top five single in the U.S. Lauper became the first woman in the 26-year history of Billboard to take four singles from the same album to Top 5 on the Hot 100. The song was mostly positively received by critics. An acoustic version was sung by Lauper on her 2005 album, The Body Acoustic. In this version, Shaggy provided backing vocals."@en ;

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Angie_(song)>	rdf:type	dbo:MusicalWork ;
	dbo:abstract	"\"Angie\" is a song by the rock band The Rolling Stones, featured on their 1973 album Goats Head Soup. Written by Mick Jagger and Keith Richards and recorded in November and December 1972, \"Angie\" is an acoustic-guitar-driven ballad which tells of the end of a romance. The song's distinctive piano accompaniment was played by Nicky Hopkins, a Rolling Stones recording-session regular. The strings on the piece (as well as on another song, \"Winter\") were arranged by Nicky Harrison. An unusual feature of the original recording is that singer Mick Jagger's vocal guide track (made before the final vocals were performed) is faintly audible throughout the song (an effect sometimes called a \"ghost vocal\"). Released as a single in August 1973, \"Angie\" went straight to the top of the US Billboard Hot 100 and reached No. 5 on the UK singles chart. The song was also a No. 1 hit in both Canada and Australia for five weeks each and topped the charts in many countries throughout Europe and the rest of the world. Because of the song's length, some radio stations made edits to shorten it to 3 minutes, omitting the longer coda and the second instrumental section of the song. There was speculation that the song was about David Bowie's first wife Angela, the actress Angie Dickinson, Keith Richards' newborn daughter Dandelion Angela, and others. In 1993, in an interview for the liner notes to the Rolling Stones' compilation album Jump Back: The Best of The Rolling Stones, Richards said that the title was inspired by his baby daughter. However, in his 2010 memoir Life, Richards said that he had chosen the name at random when writing the song \u2014 before he knew that his baby would be named Angela or even knew that his baby would be a girl \u2014 and that the song \"was not about any particular person.\" According to NME, Jagger's contributions to the lyrics referred to his breakup with Marianne Faithfull. The Rolling Stones have frequently performed the song in concert; it was included in set lists on their 1973, 1975, and 1976 tours, and they have performed it on every tour since their 1982 European tour. Concert renditions were released on the albums Stripped and Live Licks. In the documentary Protagonist, the former German terrorist Hans-Joachim Klein remarks that the song inspired him to adopt \"Angie\" as the moniker he used during his militant activities in the 1970s. In 2005, the German political party CDU used the song in its election campaign for Angela Merkel, although the Rolling Stones had not given them permission to do so."@en ;

As well as its musical qualities, it is noted for its innovative video, directed by Bowie and David Mallet. The lyrics revisit Bowie's Major Tom character from 1969's \"Space Oddity\" in a darker theme, which he referenced once again in 1995 with \"Hallo Spaceboy\". The song's original title was \"People Are Turning to Gold.\" Interviewed in 1980, Bowie described the song as a \"nursery rhyme\": \"It's very much a 1980s nursery rhyme. I think 1980s nursery rhymes will have a lot to do with the 1880s/1890s nursery rhymes which are all rather horrid and had little boys with their ears being cut off and stuff like that\". Years later, Bowie said that with \"Ashes to Ashes\" he was \"wrapping up the seventies really\" for himself, which \"seemed a good enough epitaph for it\". AllMusic critic Dave Thompson described the track and its the accompanying music video as \"a very deliberate acknowledgement of the then-burgeoning new romantic scene.\""@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"Borderline\" is a song by American singer Madonna from her eponymous debut studio album Madonna (1983). It was released on February 15, 1984 by Sire Records as the album's fifth single. Written and composed by producer Reggie Lucas, the song was remixed by Madonna's then-boyfriend John \"Jellybean\" Benitez. She used a refined and expressive voice for the song. Its lyrics dealt with the subject of a love that is never fulfilled. Contemporary critics and authors applauded the song, calling it harmonically the most complex song from the Madonna album and complimenting the dance-pop nature of the song. \"Borderline\" became Madonna's second top ten hit on the Billboard Hot 100, peaking at number ten. In the United Kingdom it reached number two after it was re-released as a single in 1986. Elsewhere, the song reached the top 10 or top 20 of a number of European nations while peaking the singles chart of Ireland. The song was placed at 84 on Blender magazine's \"The 500 Greatest Songs Since You Were Born\", while Time included it on the critic list \"All-Time 100 Songs\". The accompanying music video portrayed Madonna with a Latin-American man as her boyfriend. She was enticed by a British photographer to pose and model for him, but later returned to her original boyfriend. The video generated interest amongst academics, who noted the use of power as symbolism in it. With the video, Madonna was credited for breaking the taboo of interracial relationships and was considered one of her career-making moments. The release of the video on MTV increased Madonna's popularity further. Madonna has performed the song on her Virgin Tour (1985) and the Sticky & Sweet Tour (2008), where a punk-rock version of the song was performed. \"Borderline\" has been covered by a number of artists, including Duffy, Jody Watley, Counting Crows, and The Flaming Lips."@en ;

It gave the group their first appearance on the UK Charts, reaching number 72 in June 1995. After their next single, a re-issue of \"Sick & Tired\", reached the top 40, \"Carnival\" was re-pressed and reached a peak of number 35. \"Carnival\" was also the first released material by The Cardigans on which Nina Persson received a writing credit, on this occasion alongside bassist Magnus Svenningsson whom she would later supersede as the group's primary lyricist. The song concerns the narrator's unrequited love for a boy, and mentions a \"carnival\" (the description actually appears to refer to a funfair) which the narrator would like to attend with the boy but does not go because he never responds to her. The song's verses include the sound of what appears to be a hammond organ. The single's B sides were a cover of Ozzy Osbourne's \"Mr Crowley\", one of several Osbourne and Black Sabbath cover versions released by the group; and \"Emmerdale\", an instrumental which shared its name with their previous album, but did not appear on it. \"Carnival\" was featured on the Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery soundtrack."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"Come What May\" is a song composed by David Baerwald, originally intended for the film William Shakespeare's Romeo + Juliet. However, it was first heard publicly, and is best known as the romantic love theme from Baz Luhrmann's 2001 film Moulin Rouge!, where it is sung by Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman in their respective roles as Christian and Satine. The song takes its title from a phrase that originates from Shakespeare's Macbeth. The song plays an important role in the film. When the forbidden strong and close romantic relationship between Christian and Satine has been discovered, Christian pens this romance song and includes it in the musical he is currently writing. Each time either of them sings this song, they can secretly declare their equally deep and true romantic love for each other. The version of the song on the soundtrack album differs slightly from the version heard in the film. The lyrics \"Every day I love you more and more\" and \"Listen to my heart, can you hear it sing / Telling me to give you everything\" can be heard on the soundtrack version. In the movie, they are replaced by a musical interlude the first time, and, the second time, Satine sings instead of the latter part: \"come back to me and forgive everything.\" The single version can be found on the original soundtrack, while the original film version can be found on the follow-up soundtrack."@en ;

It was written by Carey and Snoop Dogg, and produced by the former and Damizza for Carey's seventh studio album, Rainbow (1999). It features Snoop Dogg throughout the songs bridge and is built around a sample of the 1988 song \"Piece of My Love,\" originally performed by Guy and written by Teddy Riley, Aaron Hall, Timmy Gatling and Gene Griffin. Throughout the song, the protagonist reveals the struggles of dealing with insomnia and thoughts of a past relationship during the night, as she spirals out of control and declares \"I gotta get me some sleep.\" The song was the center of a very public controversy between Carey and her label Sony Music Entertainment, due to their lack of promotion of it as a commercial single. It, alongside its A-side \"Can't Take That Away (Mariah's Theme)\" were not eligible to chart on the Billboard Hot 100, due to the charts rules at the time of their release. Eventually, the song was able to attain a peak of twenty eight, Carey's first single to miss the top twenty. The song's music video features Carey spending a restless night in her apartment, throwing wine and cereal while trying to \"get some sleep.\" Snoop Dogg makes an appearance in the video through a television monitor.

	dbo:abstract	"\"Dark Horse\" is a song by English musician George Harrison, released as the title track to his 1974 solo album on Apple Records. The song was the album's lead single in North America, becoming a top-twenty hit in the United States, but it was Harrison's first single not to chart in Britain when issued there in February 1975. While the term \"dark horse\" had long been applied to Harrison due to his success as a solo artist following the Beatles' break-up in 1970, commentators recognise the song as Harrison's rebuttal to a number of possible detractors: those reviewers who criticised the spiritual content of his 1973 album Living in the Material World; his first wife, Pattie Boyd; and his former bandmates John Lennon and Paul McCartney. Harrison also used the title for that of his record label, and his 1974 North American tour with Ravi Shankar would come to be known as the Dark Horse Tour. Harrison taped an early version of the song with Ringo Starr in 1973, intending to finish this recording for the album. The officially released version was recorded during rehearsals for his 1974 concerts, at a time when Harrison's exhaustion through overwork contributed to him contracting laryngitis and losing his voice. Harrison's singing was similarly affected throughout the ensuing tour. A number of music critics rate \"Dark Horse\" as one of Harrison's finest post-Beatles compositions and believe that the single would have achieved greater success with a cleaner vocal performance. The recording reflects Harrison's embracing of the jazz-funk musical genre, and features contributions from musicians such as Tom Scott, Jim Horn, Billy Preston, Willie Weeks and Andy Newmark. Harrison played \"Dark Horse\" throughout both the 1974 tour and his 1991 Japanese tour with Eric Clapton. A live version appears on his 1992 album Live in Japan. Recordings also exist of Harrison performing the song during radio and television appearances in the 1970s, although none of these versions are available on official releases. For the first time since the debut CD releases of Dark Horse and The Best of George Harrison in the early 1990s, \"Dark Horse\" was remastered in 2014, along with its parent album, as part of Harrison's Apple Years reissues. The latter release includes an acoustic demo of the song, which Harrison recorded in 1974 before the onset of laryngitis."@en ;

It was originally released on September 17, 2013, by Capitol Records as the first promotional single from Perry's fourth studio album, Prism (2013). Three months later, it was released as the third official single on December 17. Both artists co-wrote the song with its producers, Max Martin, Cirkut, and Dr. Luke, alongside Sarah Hudson. It was conceived by Perry and Hudson during a writing session in Perry's hometown of Santa Barbara, California, and Juicy J was later commissioned for a verse on the song. \"Dark Horse\" combines the genres of trap and hip hop, replicating what has been described as a \"Southern rap-techno mashup\". The track features a minimal production, with a \"seductive\" and \"mature\" tone to Perry's vocals, while Juicy J is featured on the song's intro and rapped bridge. Perry, in interviews, said she wanted the song to have a \"witchy, spell-y kind of black magic-y idea\", so she wrote it from the perspective of a witch warning a man not to fall in love with her because if he does, she will be his last. The song was part of a competition sponsored by Pepsi in which fans could vote via Twitter on whether they would prefer either \"Dark Horse\" or \"Walking on Air\" to be released as the first promotional single from Prism. Upon release, music critics praised the song's experimentation with urban music and Perry's vocals, though were less favorable on Juicy J's contribution to the song. \"Dark Horse\" has been a commercial success, charting at number one in Canada, the Netherlands and the United States.

Perry first performed the song live at the 2013 iHeartRadio Music Festival in Las Vegas on September 20, 2013.

The song was written and produced by Shondrae \"Bangladesh\" Crawford, Sean Garrett, and Beyonc\u00E9 herself for her third studio album I Am... Sasha Fierce (2008). It was released as the album's third overall single in the United States alongside the third international single \"Halo\". \"Diva\" is an R&B song, which is set in a hip hop groove, and carries a stuttering beat. Its lyrics deliver messages of independence and female empowerment. The song boasts a beat and a bassline similar to those of another Bangladesh 2008 production, \"A Milli\" by American rapper, Lil Wayne; critics coined \"Diva\" as a \"female companion\" to the latter. \"Diva\" received mixed to positive reviews from critics, who had polarized opinions concerning its affiliation with \"A Milli\". Despite being released to rhythmic and urban radios only in the US, the song peaked at number 19 on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart, topped the US Hot Dance Club Play chart, and attained a high point of number three on the US Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart. \"Diva\" was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), denoting shipment of 500,000 copies. Although it was only officially released in the US, the song appeared on the singles charts in Australia, Ireland, the Netherlands, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom. The accompanying music video for \"Diva\" was directed by Melina Matsoukas. It shows the singer and backup dancers in a warehouse, and presents a choreography similar to that of her previous single \"Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)\" (2008). Beyonc\u00E9 also appears in different Thierry Mugler couture pieces. The video received mixed response from critics, who were not pleased by its concept as they believed it portrayed Beyonc\u00E9's alter ego Sasha Fierce ineffectively. It was ranked at number 13 on BET's Notarized: Top 100 Videos of 2009 countdown. Although Beyonc\u00E9 did not perform the song in any televised appearances, it was a part of her set list on the I Am...

The second version, which exceeds the former's length by 14 seconds, was the B-Side to the UK single \"Magic Bus\".This version has a more prominent guitar line, as well as spooky \"Mr. Hyde\" effects (the voice John Entwistle had used in chorus of the song \"Boris the Spider\") and can be found on the Japanese release of the Who's Missing/Two's Missing compilation released in 2011. This song, as well as \"Boris the Spider\" and \"Silas Stingy\" all had lyrics that suited children.Kit Lambert had the idea of making a kids' album composed entirely of songs like these, but it never saw the light of day."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"Dream On\" is a power ballad by Aerosmith from their 1973 debut album, Aerosmith. Written by lead singer Steven Tyler, this song became their first major hit and classic rock radio staple. Released in June 1973, it peaked at number 59 nationally but hit big in the band's native Boston, where it was the number 1 single of the year on the less commercial top 40 station WBZ-FM, number 5 for the year on highly rated Top 40 WRKO-AM and number 16 on heritage Top 40 WMEX-AM. The album version of \"Dream On\" (4:28, as opposed to the 3:25 1973 45rpm edit), was re-issued early in 1976, debuting at number 81 On January 10, breaking into the Top 40 on February 14 and peaking at number 6 on the Billboard Hot 100 national chart, April 10. Columbia chose to service Top 40 radio stations with a re-issue of the 3:25 edited version, thus, many 1976 Pop Radio listeners were exposed to the group's first Top 10 effort through the 45 edit. \"Dream On\" was first played live in Mansfield, Connecticut at the Shaboo Inn. In a 2011 interview, Tyler reminisced about his father, a Juilliard-trained musician. He recalled lying beneath his dad's piano as a three-year-old listening to him play classical music. \"That's where I got that Dream On chordage,\" he said. Tyler says that this was the only song on the band's first album where he used his real voice. He was insecure about how his voice sounded on tape, so for the other songs, he tried to sing a bit lower and sound more like soul artists, such as James Brown. The song is also famous for its building climax to showcase Tyler's trademark screams. The main riff and chorus of the song were sampled in the 2003 song \"Sing for the Moment\" by rapper Eminem on The Eminem Show album. The song is composed in the key of F minor."@en ;

In May 1995, it entered the UK Singles Chart at No. 1 for one week. The song was first released in the United Kingdom in September 1994 and peaked at number 18 in the UK Singles Chart. After the track saw moderate success and broke the top 20 in the UK, the DJ behind Livin' Joy, Viani DJ, then decided to focus on other projects, namely Alex Party to record \"Don't Give Me Your Life\". After the success of \"Don't Give Me Your Life\", he released another single, \"Read My Lips\", which did not match the success the previous track had achieved, so they returned their focus on Livin' Joy once more and returned with a remix of their original hit \"Dreamer\". The song was re-released and entered the UK chart at number 1, beating the out-going number one by Oasis by a narrow margin of just 500 sales. In the United States, the song was a sleeper hit on pop radio, but finally managed to peak at #72 on the Billboard Hot 100, #38 on Billboard's Rhythmic Top 40 chart, #10 on Billboard's Hot Dance Music/Maxi-Singles Sales chart and #40 on Billboard's Hot Dance Music/Club Play chart. In mid-1996, \"Dreamer\" re-entered the Billboard Hot 100, peaking at #95 The first version released in 1994 was sung by US singer Janice Robinson, but when the group was unable to reach a deal with Robinson for a follow up single she was replaced by Doris Diggs AKA Tameka Starr who did a version only found on the group's debut and only released album to date Don't Stop Movin'. Diggs remained the group's singer until their last single in 1999 single with \"Just for the Sex of It\" with plans for a widescale commercial release, but due to the public's disinterest it was eventually only released in the UK and Australia where it peaked at #76 on the charts and managed to receive a limited club run where it was a popular hit in the nightclubs. Janice Robinson released her own version of Dreamer as a solo artist in 2005 reaching number 5 in the US Dance chart."@en ;

The album version of the song contains an extra verse and runs 30 seconds longer than the single version. The unique wah-clavinet sound in the song was achieved with a Mu-Tron III envelope filter pedal. The bass line is provided by a Moog synthesizer and using overdubs, Wonder played all instruments on the track, including drums and percussion. The song was also released in the UK but achieved only modest success, reaching number 29 in the UK Singles Chart."@en ;

The song was written by Rik Emmett. The song, like Lay It on the Line was written two years before the release of the album. After failing to be noticed as an acoustic track in concert the band decided to make it a rock song and placed it at the end of the concept song, The Twisted Maze which compasses the entire second side of the vinyl. The song has never been performed by the entire band in concert, due to its broad and complex arrangements. The live version from Stages, which is the only official version, was done acoustically. The B-side is the title track for the album, clocking in at five minutes and forty eight seconds. The video of the song was cut up and altered to help its chart potential, where it became only a two-minute-and-fifty-nine-second track. The video did not include the acoustic folk section of the beginning or the disco-styled breakdown at the end. This version was also the version released on the singles for every foreign country, thus the only countries to have the entire song was Canada and the United States."@en ;

The mellow ballad features a clean guitar melody that is very reminiscent of \"Goodbye Blue Sky\" by Pink Floyd, and heavily multi-tracked vocals in its chorus. The \"extreme\" nature of producer Mutt Lange's recording methods is also exampled in the chorus, where the clean guitar chords were recorded one note at a time as opposed to the traditional method of strumming them, in effect \"building\" a chord by recording the notes that make them up as one would build a wall by stacking bricks upon each other one-by-one as confirmed by recording engineer Mike Shipley.

The original version was released as the album's fourth single; Ja Rule of The Inc. Records (formerly known as Murder Inc. Records) wrote and was featured on a new version of the song, entitled \"I'm Real (Murder Remix)\", which was featured on a reissue of J.Lo in July 2001, on Lopez's remix album, J to tha L\u2013O! The Remixes (2002), and Ja Rule's third studio album, Pain Is Love (2001). The original pop and R&B version was well received by music critics who complimented the '80s style, while the remix received mixed reviews for the lyrics. However, both songs have been appreciated for the use of the samples. Singer Ashanti (also on The Inc.) provided backing vocals on the Murder Remix. The \"Murder Inc. Remix\" topped the Billboard Hot 100 for five non-consecutive weeks, beginning September 8, 2001, and also topped the Hot 100 Airplay chart. The two songs are essentially different songs with the same title. Much controversy followed the song after its release.

	dbo:abstract	"\"I'm with Stupid\" is a song by British synthpop band Pet Shop Boys and is featured on their 2006 album, Fundamental. It was released 8 May 2006 as the lead single from the album in the United Kingdom and the rest of the European Union (see 2006 in British music). It became the duo's 21st Top 10 single in the UK, peaking at #8. Though ostensibly about a romantic relationship with a man perceived by the public as a \"moron\", the song has been acknowledged as being, on another level, about Tony Blair's beleaguered relationship with George W. Bush. The protagonist of the song is eventually brought to wonder if the other's stupidity might not be a front: (See also special relationship as a term in international relations.) It received its official first play 31 March on BBC Radio 2 and charted at number eight in the UK Singles Chart, becoming the duo's twenty-first UK top ten single. One of the single's B-sides, \"The Resurrectionist\", is about body-snatching in the English Regency era, carried out by people literally called \"resurrectionists\". \"I'm with Stupid\" was performed on the 23 April 2006 episode of Top of the Pops, in the latest in a long series of Pet Shop Boys performances on the UK music programme. The performance was planned to include six dancers, wearing masks depicting Blair's and Bush's faces. The BBC's editorial department objected, however, citing the need to be politically \"impartial\"; in the end, only one Blair mask and one Bush mask was used, with the remaining four masks replaced by ones depicting Bill Clinton, David Cameron, Menzies Campbell, and Vladimir Putin.The song was later performed in Germany in the form the BBC had objected to. Remixers of the single include Melnyk, Max Tundra, Abe Duque and Pet Shop Boys themselves. Several of the official remixes were not released on physical media at all, being exclusively available on iTunes Music Store and other online music stores. In addition, the single has yet to be released in any form in the United States."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"Irresistible\" is a song by American recording artist Jessica Simpson that Sony Music released on April 12, 2001, as the lead single from her second studio album of the same name. Its title and concept were proposed by singer-songwriter Pamela Sheyne, while Arnthor Birgisson, an acquaintance of Sony chief executive officer Tommy Mottola, and his partner Anders Bagge developed the melody and co-wrote the verses with Sheyne. The lyrics are more sexually suggestive than Simpson's previous songs. The song, composed in the key of C major, is a mid-tempo R&B number with dance-pop and funk influences. Instruments featured in the song include strings, synthesizers, percussion, and acoustic piano. The lyrics center on the tension between a young woman's sexual desires and her inhibitions. A So So Def remix of the piece features Lil' Bow Wow and Jermaine Dupri, and incorporates samples of Kool & the Gang's \"Jungle Boogie\" (1973). The accompanying music video, directed by Simon Brand, has a James Bond theme and features scenes of Simpson dressed as a spy. A music video for the So So Def remix was also filmed, featuring appearances by Dupri and Lil' Bow Wow inter-cut with scenes of Simpson. She performed the song as part of the set list of her DreamChaser Tour (2001) and Reality Tour (2004). The single was also promoted with live performances on various televised appearances and the MTV Total Request Live Tour (2001). \"Irresistible\" was featured on the Disney Channel Original Series Lizzie McGuire (2001). Critics gave \"Irresistible\" mostly negative reviews noting the similarity to Pink's \"There You Go\" (2000). Although a few praised the song for its theme and production, most criticized Simpson's singing style, the sexual nature of the song's lyrics, and the over-use of digital sound enhancers. The song reached number eleven on the UK Singles Chart and number fifteen on the United States Billboard Hot 100, while peaking within the top twenty in nine other countries. Despite not charting within the top twenty in Australia, it was certified gold by the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) for shipments of more than 35,000 copies within the country. The song ranked on the Billboard Hot 100 and Australian year-end charts at numbers sixty-three and fifty, respectively."@en ;

This version changed the song from a rhythmic piano based ballad into a slower guitar driven song. This version of the song was released as the fifth single from the album. The song caused minor controversy when Britney Spears debuted a new song during her Dream Within a Dream Tour called \"My Love was Always There\" which featured similar lyrics to the chorus of Iglesias's Maybe as well as the same melody throughout the song.

Seger wrote the song as a coming of age tale about adolescent love and adult memory of it. It was based on Seger's own teenaged love affair he experienced in the early 1960s. It took him six months to write the song. The song was recorded quickly at Nimbus Nine Studios in Toronto, Ontario with producer Jack Richardson. As much of Seger's Silver Bullet Band had returned home by this point, the song was recorded with several local session musicians. Released as a single in December 1976, it reached number four on the Billboard Hot 100, becoming Seger's first hit single since Ramblin' Gamblin' Man from 1969. It also charted at number five in Canada and was a top 25 hit in Australia. The song was responsible for changing Seger from being a popular regional favorite into a national star."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"Obsessed\" is a song by American singer Mariah Carey from her twelfth studio album, Memoirs of an Imperfect Angel (2009). The song was written and produced by Carey, Terius \"The-Dream\" Nash and Christopher \"Tricky\" Stewart, and was released as the album's lead single on June 16, 2009 by Island Records. The song draws musical influences from R&B and hip hop music, and is built around a thumping bass line. Additionally, the song is accentuated by hand claps, while Carey's voice is processed with Auto-Tune. Lyrically, the song describes Mariah's dilemma regarding constant claims of a prior relationship from rapper Eminem, although he is not specifically mentioned. The song received generally positive reviews from music critics who highlighted it as a stand-out track from Memoirs of an Imperfect Angel. Many reviewers complimented its clever lyrics and strong beat, while others criticized the song's usage of auto-tune on Carey's vocals. At the time of the song's release, \"Obsessed\" was the center of controversy, as critics and the media suggested Carey was aiming it at American rapper Eminem, who had negatively referenced her several times in songs. Eminem released a song called \"The Warning\" in response. \"Obsessed\" peaked at number seven on the Billboard Hot 100, becoming Carey's 27th top-ten hit on the chart. In terms of total top-ten chart entries among all artists in the chart's history, Carey tied for fifth place after the song's peak, with Janet Jackson and Elton John. Internationally, the song was not released throughout parts of Europe, as Island Records decided to give priority to the album's second single, Carey's cover of Foreigner's classic \"I Want to Know What Love Is\". \"Obsessed\" peaked within the top 10 in France and Italy, and in the top 20 in Australia, Belgium, Canada and Japan. The song's music video was directed by film-maker Brett Ratner, who Carey has previously worked with on other music videos. Throughout the video, Carey plays both herself and the character of the male stalker, dressed in a bellhop uniform, as well as a gray hoodie and sweatpants. Two videos were shot for \"Obsessed\", one for the original version, and one for the remixed version, which features rapper Gucci Mane. The video was shot predominantly at the Plaza Hotel, and on the streets of New York City. After several photographs of Carey dressed as the stalker were leaked, tabloids immediately compared Carey's costume to Eminem's usual attire. Carey performed the song live on the fourth season of America's Got Talent, The Today Show, and throughout her Angels Advocate Tour (2009\u201310)."@en ;

Released on October 25, 2010, it is the first single from the album. It was produced by RedOne, BeatGeek and Jimmy Joker, and is distinctively different from Scherzinger's previous attempts at releasing solo material. \"Poison\" is backed with powerful synthesizers and a pulsing dance-pop beat. The single was released as a two-track digital download and as a seven-track remixes extended play (EP). \"Poison\" has received mostly positive reviews from most music critics who praised her new sound and the energy on the record but some criticized the song for being too generic. Scherzinger performed \"Poison\" live for the first time on seventh series of The X Factor on November 28, 2010, to coincide with the song's UK release. Both the show's judges and studio audiences gave her a standing ovation, with the media later praising her energy, choreography and live vocals. An accompanying music video, directed by Joseph Kahn, sees Scherzinger take on the role of a female superhero and switches between a good-girl and bad-girl persona. It was noted for its similarities to another Kahn-directed video, \"Toxic\" by Britney Spears. \"Poison\" peaked at number three on the UK Singles Chart becoming Scherzinger's second most successful single as a solo artist, in addition to peaking at number seven in Ireland, where it also became one of her highest charting releases. The single reached number one in Scotland, which was Scherzinger's first solo number one worldwide."@en ;

The song attained worldwide success, topping the charts in twenty countries including the United States, United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, Canada and many European countries. \"Poker Face\" is the best-selling single of 2009 worldwide, with over 9.5 million in sales. It is among the best-selling singles of all time, having sold over 14 million copies. The accompanying music video for the song portrays Gaga singing it in various costumes and playing strip poker in a getaway villa.

	dbo:abstract	"\"Refugee\" is the first track released from Simple Minds founding member and vocalist Jim Kerr's first solo album Lostboy! AKA Jim Kerr in early 2010, although \"Shadowland\" was the first official single release from the project. According to Jim Kerr the track was written three years earlier but never had been properly arranged before producer Jez Coad started to work on the song. A short, instrumental edit of the first opening bars could be heard on the first incarnation of the Lostboy! AKA website, the same snippet was also being used by Sky Sports as the theme for their live broadcast of the Scotland football game on March 4, 2010. The album version of the track \"Refugee\" was exclusively premiered on Billy Sloan's radio show of the March 7, 2010, along with an exclusive remix by Simon Hayward. Both of these tracks were then added to the Lostboy! AKA YouTube Channel. A week later (March 16t, 2010), the full album version of \"Refugee\" was made available as a download from the initial www.lostboyaka.com website as a \"thank you\" to fans. On April 13, 2010 \"Refugee\" was released as the lead track of the Welcome Gift 1 free download twin pack which was released as part of the main website launch of www.lostboyaka.com. Besides the previously released album version of \"Refugee\", the twin pack included the track \"What Goes On\" (Scary Monsters Mix), which was exclusive to this release. \"What Goes On\" is a cover of a Velvet Underground track, written by Lou Reed. The package also included the artwork and a text file requesting that the tracks not be uploaded to any other site. \"Refugee\" was also included as the third track on the \"Shadowland\" promo single in its album version form, contrary to the new single mixes of the title track. The same tracks as on the \"Shadoland\" promo was on the download single release of \"Shadowland\", with the album version of \"Refugee\" included. An additional exclusive remix of the song called Atmoxic Remix was only available as a download with the album from iTunes. It was a stripped down basic version, and sounded more like the original demo than the final studio track."@en ;

The second single from the debut album, \"Lovers,\" was originally slated to be a b-side to the Refugees single. This was changed after the record label decided it was worthy of being on the album. Anderson claimed that b-side \"Southern Rain\" deserved to be on the album. The song was well received by critics. Nick Cowen of Drowned in Sound rated it 8 out of 10, saying: \"'Refugees' showcases all the dilettante-like swagger the pair's former band exhibited on its more upbeat numbers.\" John Murphy of musicOMH wrote that, \"Anderson sounds more inspired than he has done in years and the song itself boasts a gloriously epic feel, worthy of the first Suede album.\""@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"Rise\" is an instrumental written by Andy Armer and Randy Badazz Alpert, and first recorded by trumpeter Herb Alpert. The instrumental track was included on Alpert's solo album Rise and released as a single in 1979. It reached number one on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 in October of that year and remained in the top position for two weeks. Herb Alpert thus became the first (and only) artist to reach the top of the Hot 100 with a vocal performance (\"This Guy's in Love with You\", 1968) as well as an instrumental performance. \"Rise\" also spent one week atop the adult contemporary chart. \"Rise\" was successful on the other charts, peaking at number four on the R&B chart and number seventeen on the disco chart. The recording also received a Grammy Award for Best Pop Instrumental Performance. Songwriters Andy Armer and Randy Badazz Alpert were both nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Instrumental Composition. \"Rise\" was originally recorded as an uptempo dance number, however, while recording the master at A&M studios, the drummer on the session, Steve Schaefer, strongly suggested that Herb and Randy try slowing the tempo down to 100bpm. Upon release, the instrumental received an unexpected burst of promotion: Jill Farren Phelps, musical director of the ABC soap opera General Hospital, decided to use \"Rise\" as the musical backdrop for the rape of Laura Webber by Luke Spencer. For several weeks afterward, the recording was played on the show to evoke the memory of Luke's act. The added exposure in an extremely popular program boosted sales to the point of selling more than one million copies. Shortly after \"Rise\" became a hit in the United States, it became a hit in the United Kingdom when British disc jockeys were playing import copies of the record at the wrong speed. In the 1981 Hindi movie Yaarana starring Amitabh Bachchan and Neetu Singh, Neetu Singh teaches Amitabh some dance moves to this tune. The piece almost plays full length as Amitabh masters disco dancing. A sample of \"Rise\" is the entire musical groove of the 1997 number-one worldwide hit song, \"Hypnotize\", recorded by The Notorious B.I.G. and co-produced by Sean \"Puffy\" Combs. The sample is credited on both the single, \"Hypnotize\" and in the liner notes for the Notorious B.I.G's album, Life After Death. In 1999, Brazilian saxophonist L\u00E9o Gandelman did a remake of \"Rise\" for his album \"Brazilian Soul\". R&B singer Monica sampled the recording on the song I'm Back on her 2002 album All Eyez on Me (Monica album)"@en ;

It features Pusha T, who is signed to West's label GOOD Music. The production was handled by West, Emile, Jeff Bhasker, and Mike Dean. The composition features repetitive piano riffs, intricate samples and a production style with several similarities to West's album 808s & Heartbreak (2008). Described as a deeply personal song in nature, it expresses West's thoughts on his failed relationships, and his acceptance of the media's perception of him. Lyrically the song explores criticism aimed at West in the past and serves as a \"toast to the douchebags.\" Before the song's premiere at the 2010 MTV Video Music Awards, it generated substantial public interest due to what had happened the year prior at the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards. West's performance was rewarded with positive reviews, with the full song being released online on October 4, 2010. The song received general acclaim from music critics and was listed amongst the best songs of the year by several publications, including MTV, Pitchfork Media, Rolling Stone, Complex, New York Post, amongst others. Critics praised the song for its sincere subject matter, the openness of the song and the soulful, clean production. Upon release, the song became one of the best reviewed singles released by West, with several critics noted that the track solidified West's commercial comeback with the public. The song debuted and peaked on the Billboard Hot 100 at position 12 and is the centerpiece of Runaway, a 35-minute short film featuring the majority of songs from My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy. The song's nearly ten-minute music video features ballet dancers performing elaborate choreography. The music video received mostly positive reviews from music critics, who praised the scope of the video, the degree of creativity and the production design. Multiple cover artworks were designed by contemporary visual artist George Condo.

It was co-written by the group (Perrie Edwards, Jesy Nelson, Leigh-Anne Pinnock and Jade Thirlwall) with TMS (Thomas Barnes, Peter Kelleher and Ben Kohn) and Maegan Cottone, and produced by TMS. Lyrically, \"Salute\" is a girl-power song, being called \"a call to arms for women everywhere to stand up and fight whatever imaginary enemy is standing in their way,\" with military metaphors, war sirens, and hip hop and trap influences, drawing comparisons to Destiny's Child and Beyonc\u00E9's \"Run the World (Girls)\". The backing track samples Xzibit's Paparazzi. Music critics gave the song positive reviews, with most praising its empowering lyrics and military-inspired drum beats. Some even noticed it would fit perfectly as an opening song for the tour, as well as being one of the strongest tracks of 2013. The song became a top-ten hit on the charts of Scotland and United Kingdom, becoming the band's sixth top-ten single in the UK, while reaching the top-twenty in Ireland and top-forty in Belgium. A music video for the song features the band dancing in an underground warehouse with an entourage of male dancers, some of whom are on leads. To promote the song, the band performed in many TV shows, including Britain's Got Talent and the Today Show."@en ;

The song was released on August 18, 2005, by Jive Records, as the sole single from Spears' first extended play, Britney & Kevin: Chaotic (2005). In July 2004, Spears announced her engagement to American dancer Kevin Federline, later revealing she would be taking another career break to start a family. Spears wrote the song two weeks before knowing she was pregnant with her first child, Sean Preston Federline. A pop ballad, \"Someday (I Will Understand)\" lyrics refer to a feeling of empowerment as a pregnant woman. A remixed version of the song was included on the 2005 remix compilation, B in the Mix: The Remixes. \"Someday (I Will Understand)\" has received mixed reviews from music critics. A few reviewers considered it as a lesson on the singer's history and a \"tear-jerker\" ballad, while others considered it a non-savable \"flop single\". The song reached the top ten in Denmark, Sweden and Switzerland and also charted in a number of European countries. An accompanying music video, directed by Michael Haussman, premiered on the finale of Britney & Kevin: Chaotic. Entirely shot in black-and-white, the music video features Spears as a pregnant woman and portrays a transformation of her character. Contemporary critics noted the video as a departure from Spears' previous music videos, while comparing the imagery of it to American entertainer Madonna's Kabbalah makeover."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"Someday\" is a song by Filipino singer Nina from her 2006 self-titled fourth album. It was released as the album's second commercial single in November 2006 by Warner Music Philippines. The song was written and composed by Nyoy Volante, who was her boyfriend at that time, and it was produced by Warner personnel Neil Gregorio. The song tells a story of a girl who was left by her loved, but still hopes for someone better to come. It was entirely recorded using an acoustic piano by Bobby Velasco. The single was accompanied by two slightly different music videos when it was released. The first one does not include any appearance of Nina at all. It just shows teenage girls who are miming her vocals on the song, while reminiscing to it at the same time. The second version is almost the same, but only shots of scenes taken by Nina where inserted throughout the whole duration. The first scene shows her, sitting on a dining table with coffee while singing to the song. The other scene depicts the singer in a bedroom, still, singing to the song while lying on a bed. The song was performed live on various events and shows including Nina album launch at Bagaberde, ASAP, MYX Live, Asia Uncut and Comedy Bar. The most recent performance of the song was at the Pattaya International Music Festival 2011. \"Someday\" was well received by critics and became a commercial success, topping Philippine music charts for eight weeks. It is her third original song to reach number one in the country\u2014the other two being \"Jealous\" and \"Make You Mine\". It also became her biggest hit since her 2005 Nina Live! single, \"Love Moves in Mysterious Ways\", and her seventh number one single all in all. The song was released on digital download through iTunes and Amazon.com."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"Someday\" is a song performed by all-female German group No Angels. Written and composed by Swedish musicians Thomas Jansson and Niklas Hillbom, it was produced by frequent collaborator Thorsten Br\u00F6tzmann for the band's third studio album Pure (2003). A latin-flavored pop song, the midtempo ballad's instrumentation includes flamenco guitars, castanets and synthesizers. Lyrically, \"Someday\" speaks of a woman realizing that her relationship has come to an end, though she is hopeful that she and her love interest will be able to resume their romance in another time and place. The song received a mixed reception from music critics and was released as a single on July 13, 2003, the second song to precede the release of Pure. A moderate success, it reached number 16 in Austria and number 26 in Switzerland, while it charted at number five on the German Singles Chart where it became the No Angels's seventh non-consecutive top five single. Katja Kuhl directed a music video for \"Someday\" near the Le Luc Formula One racing track in Var in southeastern France which features a love story between band member Vanessa Petruo and a male racing driver.

Although he was quoted as saying during their May 2008 tour, \"we will have to learn it first\" when asked to play the song, hinting a return to the live performance of the song in the future. This soon indeed happened when the band played a series of gigs in early 2010 under their Renegades side-project name, before being retired for good after their April 2010 gig at the Camden Electric Ballroom. It featured on the original Gran Turismo game as an instrumental. Grant once said that the song is about the struggles the band experienced while trying to get a record contract."@en ;

The song was first recorded in 1981 at The Manor studios and had been under consideration for the Architecture & Morality album. The lyrics on the original 1981 version and the 1983 version are different in places, reflecting the harder edge the original version presented. The 1981 version was released on the 2008 re-released Dazzle Ships album as an extra track. The original inspiration for \"Telegraph\" came from Andy McCluskey's strong feelings against politics and religion at the time. These motifs were weakened for the version on Dazzle Ships. Critic Stewart Mason in AllMusic has retrospectively described the song as \"insanely catchy\" and \"brilliant\", adding: \"[A]s the state-of-1983 electronics of the arrangement sound more and more quaint, the irony grows sharper.\""@en ;

It is about people out there trying to be understood, to live their dreams.[citation needed] The single peaked at #7 in the UK, #38 in Australia and #40 on the Euro hot 100 singles chart.

Stipe has also said the track is \"all about cunnilingus.\" On March 1, 1995, Bill Berry had to leave the stage during a performance of this song complaining of a serious headache.

It was written and produced by Christian Karlsson and Pontus Winnberg (known collectively as Bloodshy & Avant), with additional writing from Cathy Dennis and Henrik Jonback. The song released on January 13, 2004, by Jive Records, as the second single from the album. After trying to choose between \"(I Got That) Boom Boom\" and \"Outrageous\" to be the second single from In the Zone, Spears selected \"Toxic\" instead. A dance-pop song with electropop influences, \"Toxic\" features varied instrumentation, such as drums, synthesizers and surf guitar. It is accompanied by high-pitched Bollywood strings and breathy vocals. Its lyrics draw an extended metaphor of a lover as a dangerous yet addictive drug. The song has received critical acclaim by music critics, who deemed it as the strongest track of In the Zone and praised its hook and chorus. \"Toxic\" attained worldwide success, reaching the top-five in 15 countries, while topping the charts in Australia, Canada, Hungary, Ireland, Norway and the United Kingdom. In the United States, it became her fourth Top 10 single. The accompanying music video for the song was directed by Joseph Kahn and features references to Blade Runner, The Seven Year Itch and the films of John Woo. It portrays Spears as a secret agent in the search of a vial of green liquid. After she steals it, she enters an apartment and poisons her unfaithful boyfriend. The video also includes interspersed scenes of Spears naked with diamonds on her body. After Janet Jackson's Super Bowl incident, the video was considered too racy for MTV and was moved to late-night programming. Spears has performed \"Toxic\" in a number of live appearances, including the 2004 NRJ Music Awards and in three of her concert tours. It was the opening number of The Onyx Hotel Tour (2004), where she sang atop of a bus wearing a black catsuit; Spears also performed remixed versions of the song at The Circus Starring Britney Spears (2009), the Femme Fatale Tour (2011) and Britney: Piece of Me (2013). \"Toxic\" has been covered by artists such as Mark Ronson, A Static Lullaby, Reece Mastin and Ingrid Michaelson, and in television series Glee. The song has also appeared in feature films such as Knocked Up, You Again and television series Doctor Who. \"Toxic\" won Spears her first Grammy at the 2005 ceremony in the category of Best Dance Recording, while gaining her credibility amongst critics. The song has been included in lists by Pitchfork, NME and Rolling Stone as one of the best songs of the decade."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"Unbreakable\" is a song by American R&B-soul singer Alicia Keys from her live album, Unplugged (2005). Written by Keys, Kanye West, and Harold Lilly, the track features a Wurlitzer riff, and is built around a sample of Eddie Kendricks' 1977 song \"Intimate Friends\", written by Garry Glenn. It was released as the album's lead single in 2005 and peaked at number thirty-four on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100, becoming Keys' first single to miss the top twenty since 2002's \"How Come You Don't Call Me\", and failed to peak inside the top forty on Billboard Pop 100. It was nevertheless a big success on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart, where it landed at number four. The lyrics mention names of notable couples Ike and Tina Turner, Bill and Camille Cosby, Oprah Winfrey and Stedman Graham, Florida and James Evans, Will and Jada Pinkett Smith, Kimora Lee and Russel Simmons, and Joe and Katherine Jackson, as well as The Jackson 5. The song received nominations for Best Female R&B Vocal Performance and Best R&B Song at the 2006 Grammy Awards which were awarded to \"We Belong Together\" by Mariah Carey. It also won two NAACP Image Award, for \"Outstanding Song\" and \"Outstanding Music Video\". This song was written in 2003 to be included on The Diary of Alicia Keys, but was omitted in favor of \"Diary\", and nearly missed the album Unplugged. She said, \"The song was always one of my favorites, but I did not think it would fit well into my second album\"."@en ;

It was co-written and produced by Jackson and her long-time collaborators Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis, with additional writing by Thomas Lumpkins and additional production by Tommy McClendon and Dem Jointz. The song debuted on September 3, 2015 on Apple Music's Beats 1 radio station and made available for digital download on the same day Jackson officially announced the studio album's release date and tracklist. It was subsequently released to urban contemporary radio on September 29, 2015 and to Urban adult contemporary radio on October 5, 2015 as the album's second single. \"Unbreakable\" is a mid-tempo R&B song, which instrumentation consists in a thumping bass and a subdued \"funky\" beat, having a soul-sample throughout the track and Jackson's \"breezy\" vocals. It starts as an \"almost a cappella ballad\", shifting into a smooth, mid-tempo groove, and towards the end the beat is pulled back for a spoken outro over finger snaps. Described as a love letter to her fans, lyrically the song finds Jackson expressing her gratitude towards her loyal fan base and a lover, while also addressing her absence. The song received largely positive reviews from music critics, who praised its \"relaxed\" groove, her vocals and its \"rich\" harmonies. Some critics also note that her voice at certain points resemble her brother, Michael Jackson's."@en ;

It was written by Hamasaki and produced by Max Matsuura. The song is a dance with elements of trance music. Like majority of the tracks from the album, \"Whatever\" was written in third person narrative, and all lyrically deal with themes of loneliness, chaos, confusion, and the burden of her responsibilities, aimed mostly towards her public image as an recording artist. It was released as the lead single from the album on 10 February 1999 by Avex Trax and Avex Taiwan. Critical reception towards \"Whatever\" has been mixed; while critics commended Hamasaki's music change to dance music and the songs arrangement, \"Whatever\" was criticized for Hamasaki's vocal delivery and song writing. In Japan, \"Whatever\" became her single to reach the top five on the Oricon Singles Chart, peaking at number five. \"Whatever\" also reached number five on the Japanese Count Down TV chart. \"Whatever\" was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of Japan (RIAJ) for shipments of 200,000 units. The accompanying music video was directed by Wataru Takeishi, featuring Hamasaki in a room flowing with water. A child with angel wings and dreads is seen walking around a destroyed town, with scene of Hamasaki taking the place of the child's position. \"Whatever\" has been included on several concert tours and New Year Countdown shows held and hosted by Hamasaki, and has featured on one of her greatest hits compilations."@en ;

It was released by Interscope Records on June 3, 2008, as the lead single from the album. \"When I Grow Up\" was their first single following the departure of the group's longest-standing member Carmit Bachar. It was first recorded for Nicole Scherzinger's planned solo project, Her Name Is Nicole, but after its cancellation and Scherzinger's return to the group, she felt that the song was better suited for the group. It was written by Theron Thomas, Timothy Thomas and Rodney \"Darkchild\" Jerkins, who also produced the song. It is an uptempo electropop song with elements of the 1966 song, \"He's Always There\" by British rock band The Yardbirds. \"When I Grow Up\" speaks about the desire to be famous, and was described as being \"autobiographical\" by Scherzinger. The single was received favorably by contemporary music critics, many of whom highlighted it as a stand-out. It peaked at number nine on the US Billboard Hot 100, becoming the group's highest charting single since \"Buttons\" (2006). The song has sold over two million digital copies in the United States, making the Pussycat Dolls the first female group in digital history to have three singles pass the two million mark in digital sales. The song reached the top-five in countries such as Australia, Canada, France, Ireland, New Zealand and the United Kingdom, and the top-ten in Austria, Denmark, Germany and Switzerland. The song's accompanying music video premiered on June 13, 2008. Directed by Joseph Khan, it portrays the Pussycat Dolls in a traffic jam on Hollywood Boulevard. It was complimented for its dance breakdown, and was nominated in five categories at the 2008 MTV Video Music Awards, the most of that ceremony, and went on to win Best Dance Video. The Pussycat Dolls performed the song on television shows including Jimmy Kimmel Live! and So You Think You Can Dance, as well several award shows including the 2008 American Music Awards, and throughout their Doll Domination Tour (2009)."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"Wrecking Ball\" is a song recorded by American singer Miley Cyrus for her fourth studio album Bangerz (2013). It was released on August 25, 2013, by RCA Records as the album's second single. The song was written by MoZella, Stephan Moccio, Sacha Skarbek, Lukasz Gottwald, and Henry Russell Walter; production was helmed by the last two. \"Wrecking Ball\" is a pop ballad which lyrically discusses the deterioration of a relationship. \"Wrecking Ball\" received generally favorable reviews from music critics, who appreciated its lyrical content and overall production. However, some critics questioned if Cyrus' emotional delivery was genuine, since she had recently generated controversy for her increasingly sexual image. It debuted on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 at number fifty, and later became Cyrus' first number-one single in the United States after the release of its controversial music video; it retained the peak position during the following week. Nine weeks later, the track returned to number one, and consequently had the largest gap between number-one sittings in Billboard Hot 100 history. As of January 2014, \"Wrecking Ball\" has sold three million copies in the United States. Internationally, the song charted strongly; it topped the charts in Canada, Spain and the United Kingdom, and charted in the top-ten throughout much of Europe and Oceania. An accompanying music video for \"Wrecking Ball\" was released on September 9, 2013. It featured close-up scenes of Cyrus tearfully singing, reminiscent of the clip for \"Nothing Compares 2 U\" by Sin\u00E9ad O'Connor, interspersed with footage of a nude Cyrus swinging on a wrecking ball. Critics were divided in their opinions of the music video, feeling that it was more provocative than the clip for her previous single \"We Can't Stop\". \"Wrecking Ball\" previously held the Vevo record for the most views in the first 24 hours after its release with 19.3 million views. At the 2013 MTV Europe Music Awards, Cyrus took home the award for Best Video and the award for Video of the Year at the 2014 MTV Video Music Awards. Adding to the video's success, Cyrus won the award for World's Best Video at the 2014 World Music Awards in Monte Carlo. Cyrus has performed \"Wrecking Ball\" during several live performances, including the iHeartRadio Music Festival and an episode of Saturday Night Live."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"Young Guns (Go for It)\" (mostly written with an exclamation mark as \"Young Guns (Go for It!)\") was a song by British pop duo Wham! which was released in 1982 on Innervision Records. It was written by George Michael, one half of the duo. The song was Wham!'s first hit, although it came with some help from the BBC music programme Top of the Pops, which invited Wham! on to the show as a last-minute replacement for another act which had pulled out. It helped that the producer of Top of the Pops had seen them previously on another programme: Saturday Superstore. Wham! were just outside the Top 40 threshold of the UK Singles Chart at the time, which meant they had not climbed high enough in normal circumstances to get on the show, but they were recruited nonetheless as the highest-placed artists still climbing the charts from outside the 40. The song entered the chart initially at Number 73, went up to Number 48, then dropped to Number 52 and the week after that, it jumped to Number 42. Their appearance on Top of the Pops broke the record wide open and on the following Monday the distribution centre received some thirty thousand orders. This sent the record to Number 24 before eventually peaking at Number 3 in November 1982. George wrote the song about a teenage lad's worry that his best friend was getting too committed to a girl when he should have been enjoying his youth and the single life. It featured a middle eight aside in which the girl conversely tried to get her boyfriend to ditch the best friend, prompting a vocal battle, akin to a tug of war, between the girlfriend and the best friend which prompted the \"go for it!\" aspect of the song, as featured in the title. On Top of the Pops, George mimed the vocals to his Wham! partner Andrew Ridgeley, who \"acted\" the part of the teenage bridegroom-in-waiting. They were flanked by backing singers Dee C. Lee and Shirlie Holliman."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"Cognoscenti vs. Intelligentsia\" (also known as \"C vs. I\", meaning \"the experts versus the intellectual elite\") is a song by the Cuban Boys. The song consists almost in its entirety of a sampled loop from \"Whistle Stop\" by Roger Miller which was featured in the Disney movie Robin Hood. The sample was first featured on the Internet as part of \"The Hampster Dance\" song on the website of the same name. The song's closing lines are of an announcer of a children's radio show: This last line, usually omitted on radio play, is itself a sample from Kermit Schafer's 1950s \"recreation\" of a supposed on-air blooper by 1920s children's radio presenter, \"Uncle Don\". In fact, this faux pas is an urban legend. The sample caused many complaints to the band's label EMI, enough for a Parental Advisory sticker to be included on the single by the end of the single's first week of release, presumably by those assuming the song to be aimed at children. Additionally, the sample was left unedited on Now 45 and when the song was played by Jo Whiley on BBC Radio 1 in November, the broadcast of the song which eventually greenlit the single's release by EMI, the sample was again unedited, causing much controversy. Another notable quote within the song is taken from the 1950s dramatization of Jules Verne's Journey to the Center of the Earth: \"Don't be too happy. After a couple of months of this you'll be smacking your lips at the thought of salt beef.\" The song was first aired on John Peel's BBC Radio 1 show on April 7, 1999 and quickly became one of the most requested songs on his show, surpassing even \"God Save the Queen\" by the Sex Pistols. After being included on a free sampler CD on the industry magazine The Tip Sheet, the song caught the attention of numerous large record labels including EMI, Parlophone and RCA, thanks mostly to the efforts of Jonathan King. The band eventually signed for EMI. They were given \u00A325,000 to record a video for the song which ended up featuring a giant fibreglass melon covered in trifle and a live-action hamster singing along. Originally scheduled for release as a single in November 1999, the release date was threatened to be pushed back to some time in January 2000 until the song was played on Jo Whiley's afternoon radio show. It received much the same attention as when it had been played on Peel's show. The decision was made to move the release to December 13 to put it in line for the Christmas number 1 slot. It managed to get to number 4, being beaten by Westlife's \"I Have a Dream\". The song did however top John Peel's Festive Fifty for that year. Naturally, the song grew extreme reactions. Music journalist Charles Shaar Murray said the song was \"eloquent in it\u2019s sheer vacuity\" during a highbrow debate on Channel 4 News, and Cliff Richard, whose song \"The Millennium Prayer\", which had been number 1 in the three weeks before the chart debut of \"Cognoscenti vs. Intelligentsia\" and was released to very negative reviews, said the song was \"awful\" during an appearance on Newsround. The band's performance on Top of the Pops of the song, reportedly unaired, saw the band dressed in lab coats and covered in cobwebs. Because of the relative obscurity of the Cuban Boys both before and after the single, they are generally considered to be a one-hit wonder. The people behind the Cuban Boys went on to score further one-hit wonder successes with a remake of \"Rhinestone Cowboy\" with Glen Campbell, a novelty kids band called the Barndance Boys, and the US club hit \"I Am Gothic\" under the name Spray."@en ;

This cover was a touchstone for the new musical subgenre of rap rock, or the melding of rock and hip hop. It became an international hit and won both groups a Soul Train Music Award for Best Rap \u2013 Single in 1987."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"What's Love Got to Do with It\" is a song recorded by the American singer Tina Turner, released in 1984. It was taken from her fifth solo album, Private Dancer and became Turner's most successful single. Although Turner had already scored a UK Top 10 and U.S. Top 30 hit some months earlier with her rendition of \"Let's Stay Together\", \"What's Love Got To Do With It\" gave Turner her first and only U.S. number one. The song ranked #309 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of \"The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time\". It also ranked #38 on Songs of the Century. It was the 17th best-selling single of 1984 in the United Kingdom. In 1993, the song's title was used as the title for the biographical film about Turner's life. It was featured in the Miami Vice episode \"Calderone's Return (Part II)\", as Sonny Crockett and Ricardo Tubbs leave St. Andrews Island by boat and end credits. In 2012, \"What's Love Got to Do with It\" was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame giving Turner her 3rd Grammy Hall of Fame Award and her 11th Grammy Award."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"It's Been Awhile\" is a song recorded by rock band Staind. It was released in March 2001 as the lead single from their album Break the Cycle. The song is Staind's most successful and is their best-known song, becoming a No. 5 hit on the Billboard Hot 100, their only song to reach the pop Top 10. The song spent a second-best 20 weeks at No. 1 on the Billboard Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks chart (behind only \"Loser\" by 3 Doors Down) and a then-record 16 weeks at No. 1 on the Billboard Hot Modern Rock Tracks chart, beaten in 2007 by Foo Fighters with \"The Pretender\". The song is stylistically different from some of the other tracks on Break the Cycle, which are nu metal or standard alternative metal songs and is considered by many critics and fans to be the first sign of Staind's transition from a nu metal and alternative metal band to a post-grunge band."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"It's Mine\" is the second single from Mobb Deep's 1999 album Murda Muzik and features Nas. The song's instrumental is based on a sample of the title theme of the 1983 film Scarface (credited as \"Scarface Cues\") which was composed by Giorgio Moroder. This is the second time that Mobb Deep used music from the film for one of their singles, with the first being \"G.O.D. Pt. III\". The chorus of the song is also both a lyrical and instrumental interpolation of the 1998 song by female R&B singers Brandy and Monica, \"The Boy Is Mine\". The original Brandy and Monica lyrics were \"You need to give it up/Had about enough/It's not hard to see/The boy is mine\". Where the chorus in \"It's Mine\" (sung by Nas) goes \"Y'all need to give it up/We don't give a fuck/What y'all niggas want/Thug life is mine\". The video was directed by Hype Williams."@en ;

Described by the band as an homage to the Nirvana song \"Polly\", \"Undertow\" received favorable acclaim and placed in the United Kingdom's Independent Singles and Independent Breakers charts upon its release. A limited edition double A-side single was released as part of Record Store Day 2012. Describing the origins of the song, bassist Jenny Lee Lindberg said \"Undertow\" developed from a bassline she and guitarist Theresa Wayman were working on. According to Lindberg, \"[Wayman] just started singing the lyrics to 'Polly' over that song \u2026 instead of making that a cover \u2026 we said, 'well, write your own words to the song'.\" Lindberg added that if \"you listen to the songs back-to-back they sound nothing alike\" but referred to \"Undertow\" as \"a bit of an homage to Kurt [Cobain] and Nirvana.\" A music video for \"Undertow\" was directed by Lindberg's sister and former Warpaint drummer Shannyn Sossamon."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"Where Were You (When the World Stopped Turning)\" is a song written by the American singer-songwriter Alan Jackson. It was the lead single from his tenth studio album, Drive (2002), released on Arista Nashville. The song's lyrics center on reactions to the September 11 attacks in the United States, written in the form of questions. Jackson desired to write a song capturing the emotions surrounding the attacks, but found it difficult to do so. After completing the song, he found himself uneasy with recording it, feeling as though he might be capitalizing on a tragedy.[citation needed] He debuted the song publicly at the Country Music Association's annual awards show on November 7, 2001. It was released that month as a single and topped the Hot Country Singles & Tracks chart for five weeks; in addition, it reached number 28 on Billboard's all-genre Hot 100 chart. The song received largely positive reviews from critics, who appreciated its simple, largely apolitical stance. The song won multiple awards at the Academy of Country Music and Country Music Association Awards, including Song of the Year, and also earned Jackson his first Grammy Award for Best Country Song."@en ;

Furthermore, the line from the first verse, \"Got a brand new blues that I can't explain\", indicates Mayer exploring blues unlike before. The song also appeared as the B-side on the Trio's subsequent EP, \"Live @ Yahoo! Music\", after the track, \"Out of My Mind\", a heavily blues-influenced song written by Mayer which also appears on Try!. The B-side to \"Who Did You Think I Was\" is \"Come When I Call\", which did not appear on the album Try!, but was frequently played throughout the trio live performances, like the song, \"I Don't Need No Doctor\"."@en ;

The song was originally featured in Jackson's 1986 3D film Captain EO. It is the sixth song on the album. The song also appeared as a dance attack and level song for the later revisions of Michael Jackson's Moonwalker video game (originally the first revision used excerpts of Thriller). As with earlier songs in his career such as \"Can You Feel It\" and \"We Are the World\", the lyrics emphasize global unity, love and outreach. The song was also featured in the trailer for Jackson's 1988 film Moonwalker. In July 2009, a short part of the song has been used by singer Madonna as a tribute during the second leg of her Sticky & Sweet Tour. A Jackson impersonator performed his signature moves, while dancing to a medley of Jackson's songs. According to Quincy Jones in an interview that was featured in the 2001 special edition of Bad, Jackson wanted to include \"Streetwalker\" instead of \"Another Part of Me\".

	dbo:abstract	"\"Bad to Me\" is a song John Lennon wrote (credited to Lennon\u2013McCartney) for Billy J. Kramer with The Dakotas while on holiday in Spain. Billy J. Kramer with The Dakotas released their recording of the song in 1963 and it became their first number 1 in the UK Singles Chart. Paul McCartney was present during the recording session at Abbey Road Studios. The single would be released in the US the following year, and become a top-ten hit there, reaching number 9. It became one of the first occasions a Lennon\u2013McCartney composition made the US Top 40 recorded by an artist other than the Beatles (the first being \"A World Without Love\" by Peter & Gordon). Bootlegs exist of Lennon's original demo of the song, which was recorded on 31 May 1963. An acoustic demo from the same era was released on iTunes in December 2013 on the album The Beatles Bootleg Recordings 1963. Terry Black released a version of the song on his 1965 debut album, Only 16. Graham Parker recorded a version of the song for the 2003 album Lost Songs of Lennon & McCartney, new versions of 17 Lennon\u2013McCartney songs that were originally released by other artists. Leif Garrett also recorded a version of the song for his self-titled debut album. Finnish rock band Hurriganes covered this song in their third album, Crazy Days. Recordings of \"Bad to Me\" as the Beatles may have performed it are available on the 1989 album by Bas Muys entitled Secret Songs: Lennon & McCartney and on the 1998 release It's Four You by the Australian tribute band The Beatnix."@en ;

Barlow came by the demo in 1997, while looking to record more songs for Open Road. He changed the lyrics to represent a male point of view rather than Madonna's, and recorded the track with Stephen Lipson as producer. Barlow was apprehensive about releasing the track, but due to contractual obligations he had to release it. The song became Barlow's second consecutive number one release on the UK Singles Chart, following \"Forever Love\", and was certified silver by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI). Elsewhere it received moderate success. A music video for the song was directed by Rocky Schenck and showed Barlow singing \"Love Won't Wait\" across different locations.

When we started jamming in the room, the song morphed into something completely different, completely unexpected and a lot better than I ever imagined it being.\" Epic Records held a contest in which the participants had to identify all of the icons shown in the video (there was a list of names and silhouettes given and you had to match them) and they had the chance to win copy of the album Revelations, as well as a guitar signed by the band. Over a year and a half after release, the song rose back into the UK Rock Chart, at number 11, and a week later climbed to the top 10 at number 6. It was also a substantial rock hit in the U.S., peaking at number 3 on the Modern Rock Tracks chart and number 4 on the Mainstream Rock Tracks chart, although it did not chart for several months.

The video attracted national and international attention and through 2008 Andres Useche accepted invitations to do radio, newspaper and TV interviews in which he promoted Barack Obama's campaign. The phrase \"S\u00ED se puede\" originated with the United Farm Workers, which adopted it as the union's official slogan in 1972. It subsequently gained wider currency among other American labor unions and social justice activists."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"De M\u00FAsica Ligera\" (Spanish for Of easy-listening music) is a song and single by the Argentine rock band Soda Stereo and was written by vocalist and guitarist of the band, Gustavo Cerati. It was part of the fifth album by the band, Canci\u00F3n Animal, and was included as track number six. It is one of the most famous and symbolic songs of the group, whose musical influence has been remarkable in the history of Latin rock for over two decades. Due to its popularity, the song is considered a hymn of rock en espa\u00F1ol. It was the last song performed on their farewell and semi-mythical concert \"El \u00DAltimo Concierto\" in 1997. At the end of that song Gustavo Cerati thanked the fans of the band with a phrase that became famous: \"Gracias... totales\" (Spanish for: \"Thank you... totally!\"). This moment is remembered as one of the all-time most exciting in the history of Latin American rock."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"Elegantly Wasted\" is the first single from and title track of the album Elegantly Wasted by INXS, released in Europe, Japan, Australia and South Africa, and the US. The song is said to have been written after Hutchence and Bono from U2 went out for a \"night on the town\". \"Elegantly Wasted\" is a deft mix of rock infused with dance beats. The band's new sound bridged the gap between the public's taste for post-grunge rock anthems, and the slinky mechanical seduction of electronica. After an argument with Liam Gallagher of Oasis, Hutchence added some additional vocals to the chorus, which the rest of the band were unaware of until months after the album's release. When listening for it, the chorus can either be heard as \"I am elegantly wasted\" or \"I am better than Oasis\". This was further to an altercation between Michael Hutchence and the Gallagher brothers at the 1996 BRIT awards. At the awards Noel collected an award from Hutchence by saying \"Has-beens should not be presenting awards to gonna-be's.\" It was also reported that Liam Gallagher and Michael Hutchence had a scuffle backstage with Hutchence throwing a fire extinguisher at Liam following some disparaging remarks he made about his then lover Paula Yates. Elegantly Wasted was the last album released by INXS with Michael Hutchence, who died that same year, on 22 November 1997."@en ;

dbr:Fuck_Them_All	rdf:type	dbo:MusicalWork ;
	dbo:abstract	"\"Fuck Them All\" is a 2005 song recorded by French singer-songwriter Myl\u00E8ne Farmer. Released on 14 March 2005, it was the lead single from her sixth studio album, Avant que l'ombre.... Like all tracks from the album, the lyrics were written by the singer with music composed by Laurent Boutonnat. \"Fuck Them All\" combines pop music elements with acoustic guitar, electronic beats and synths, with a musical bridge sung as a rap in English. As a result it is often compared to Madonna's early 2000s songs. Using both crude and colorful lyrics, including sex and vulgarity, the song deals with the war between the sexes and was often considered a feminist plea in which women are presented as warriors. The accompanying music video for the song, filmed by Agust\u00ED Villaronga in Romania over two days, shows Farmer portraying two women in a warehouse and many scarecrows made by Swiss artist Martial Leiter. Displaying many symbolic elements, it was the subject of many analyses on the Internet and in the press which generally praised its aesthetic qualities, but criticized for its lack of innovation. Farmer sang \"Fuck Them All\" during her 2006 series of concert at Bercy and the performance was released on the Avant que l'ombre... \u00E0 Bercy DVD. The song received a mixed critical reception from fans and the general public, reviews ranging from \"unconvincing\" and \"vulgar\" to \"bold\" and \"catchy\". Despite this, the song was downloaded over 5,000 times from official download platforms during its first week of release, and over one million times illegally[citation needed]. It met some success on the French and Belgian (Wallonia) charts, where it reached number two and eventually became the album's best-selling single. In France, it earned a silver disc for over 100,000 units sold."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"Gotta Stop (Messin' About)\" was the follow-up single in the UK to support Prince's third album, Dirty Mind. The single was not an album track, though it was written at the same time, and possessed a similar sound. This was the first time Prince released a non-album track, and would start a long tradition of releasing them throughout the 1980s. The song is keyboard dominated, and the lyrics speak of a woman who's constantly \"messin' about\" with other men. The song contains familiar Prince themes of sexual frustration, masturbation and sexual metaphors. The track consists of two verses and multiple repeats of the chorus. It was played live on the Dirty Mind Tour with an extended instrumental section at the end. \"Gotta Stop (Messin' About)\" was released in the UK as two separate 7\" singles, one with the Dirty Mind track \"Uptown\" as a B-side, and the other with \"I Wanna Be Your Lover\", from Prince. Each single also had an accompanying 12\" single, both with the same tracks as the 7\" and both including the song \"Head\", from Dirty Mind. Despite an extensive advertising campaign and promotion, and coinciding with Prince's first UK gig, neither issue of the single charted. The track would later be released in the U.S. as the B-side of the 12\" single for \"Let's Work\", and become a highly sought after collector's item. \"Gotta Stop (Messin' About)\" was also later released on The Hits/The B-Sides."@en ;

dbr:Headfirst_Slide_into_Cooperstown_on_a_Bad_Bet	rdf:type	dbo:MusicalWork ;
	dbo:abstract	"\"Headfirst Slide into Cooperstown on a Bad Bet\" is a song by the American rock band Fall Out Boy from their fourth studio album Folie \u00E0 Deux (2008). It was initially released as a digital single as part of the buildup to the new album on iTunes on October 7, 2008. The song impacted United States modern rock radio on June 15, 2009. The title of the song refers to former Major League Baseball player Pete Rose, known for sliding headfirst into bases. Rose agreed never to work in baseball again due to an accused betting scandal while managing the Cincinnati Reds and will likely be kept out of the Hall of Fame, located in Cooperstown, New York, because of it. The band originally intended to name-drop Rose in the song's title. They changed their minds because of concerns about the lawsuit brought against OutKast over their 1999 single \"Rosa Parks\" by the civil rights activist, who was name-dropped in the title. \"Headfirst\"'s original working title was \"Does Your Husband Know?\". Chronologically, \"What a Catch, Donnie\" and \"America's Suitehearts\" were released to iTunes after \"Headfirst Slide into Cooperstown on a Bad Bet\". However, \"Headfirst Slide...\" was never serviced to radio as an official single, while the former two were later released as radio singles, albeit in vice versa order."@en ;

The song was written by Leah Haywood, Daniel James and Tony Nilsson, while production of the song was handled by Haywood and James under their production name Dreamlab. Musically, \"Hit the Lights\" is an up-tempo dance song. Lyrically, the song speaks about living in the moment and taking risks.

dbr:Holy_Holy	rdf:type	dbo:MusicalWork ;
	dbo:abstract	"\"Holy Holy\" is a song by David Bowie, originally released as a single in January 1971. It was recorded in November 1970, after the completion of The Man Who Sold the World, in the perceived absence of a clear single from that album. Like Bowie's two previous singles, it sold poorly and failed to chart. At the time Marc Bolan's Tyrannosaurus Rex was a significant source of inspiration for Bowie. On this track, according to NME editors Roy Carr and Charles Shaar Murray, \"Bolan's influence is so much in the ascendant that it virtually amounts to a case of demonic possession\". The single's B-side was another Tyrannosaurus Rex flavoured song called \"Black Country Rock\". Bowie performed \"Holy Holy\" on Britain's Granada Television wearing a dress, which he would also wear on the cover of the soon-to-be-released UK edition of The Man Who Sold the World. A more frantic version of the song was recorded in 1971 for The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars. It was dropped from the album, but subsequently appeared as the B-side to \"Diamond Dogs\" in 1974. This version was also released as a bonus track on the Rykodisc reissue of The Man Who Sold the World in 1990 (despite the sleeve notes referring to it as the original cut), as well as on the Ziggy Stardust \u2013 30th Anniversary Reissue bonus disc in 2002. Bowie himself vetoed the inclusion of the original at a late stage, and the single remained the only official release of the 1970 recording until 2015, when it was included on Re:Call 1, part of the Five Years (1969\u20131973) compilation."@en ;

In the lyrics of the song, Rick Ross refers to the cocaine traffic network the real Rick Ross had built up, stating: \"I'm into distribution, I'm like Atlantic/I got them motherfuckers flyin' across the Atlantic\". The song also contains references to Manuel Noriega, former Panamanian Militant General, Pablo Escobar, Colombian narcotics trafficker and Kenneth \"Boobie\" Williams, Miami-area drug runner. To emphasize that he is talking about Noriega the dictator and not Noreaga, the Queens-based rapper, Ross adds \"the REAL Noriega\", who he claims owes him \"a hundred favors.\" The song is featured on the track list of the video game Skate It is also featured in comedy films We're the Millers and Identity Thief. Comedian Katt Williams devised a comedy routine using the song's chorus to punctuate his humour; the routine is seen in the 2007 film American Hustle, and Williams later reprised the routine for one of his Split Sides Comedy Club performance segments in the 2008 video game Grand Theft Auto IV."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"Hyperballad\" (also known as \"'Hyper-Ballad\") is the fourth single from the studio album Post by Icelandic recording artist Bj\u00F6rk. Like the rest of her songs, the song was written by Bj\u00F6rk and co-produced by long-time collaborator Nellee Hooper. The recording sessions of Post and hence \"Hyperballad\" were set in Compass Point Studios, The Bahamas, to save tax money. \"Hyperballad\" infuses several music genres, such as classical, IDM, electronica and ambient music. The lyrical content discusses a dream that Bj\u00F6rk experienced, in which she wakes early before her lover and throws small objects off a cliff, watching them smash. She imagines her body in their place, which makes her feel better about returning to her safe home and the arms of her lover. \"Hyperballad\" was heavily lauded from contemporary music critics, who stated that it was the best song of Bj\u00F6rk's career. The song's lyrical content, vocal performance and experimentation in its production and composition were also highly praised. The song was moderately successful in the countries it charted in, including Finland, Australia, United States, Sweden and the United Kingdom (where it was the last of three top-10 hits, after \"Army of Me\" and \"It's Oh So Quiet\"). A music video was shot for the single, featuring a digitalized Bj\u00F6rk running through a field. Bj\u00F6rk performed the song at the 1997 Tibetan Freedom Concert in New York, which was recorded by Sylvia Massy for Capitol Records. This live version was subsequently included on the second disc of the Tibetan Freedom Concert album released later that year."@en ;

The song about loneliness was largely inspired by his troubled relationship with wife Audrey Sheppard.

	dbo:abstract	"\"If I Never Knew You\" is a song by American recording artists Jon Secada and Shanice, from Disney's 1995 animated feature film, Pocahontas. The song was written by composer Alan Menken and lyricist Stephen Schwartz, and originally recorded by American singer Judy Kuhn in her film role as the singing voice of Pocahontas, and American actor Mel Gibson in his role as Captain John Smith. Shanice and Secada's version is heard during film's end credits, and was released on September 12, 1995 as the second single from the film's soundtrack, after Vanessa Williams' pop rendition of the Academy Award-winning \"Colors of the Wind\". The song was originally developed for the prison scene where Pocahontas visits Captain John Smith before he is to be put to death for the alleged murder of Kocoum, Chief Powhatan's warrior whom Pocahontas was going to marry. The musical number, which was about 90% animated, was to be a duet performed by the pair as they acknowledge their love for each other. During test screenings with child audiences their attention \"seemed to wander from the film.\" Therefore, Alan Menken, the composer of the songs for Disney's Pocahontas, suggested it be cut because he also felt that it slowed the pace of the movie. Additionally, another song, \"Savages\", occurred not five minutes after. Though cut from the movie itself, If I Never Knew You was still performed by Jon Secada and Shanice at the end credits and released as a single. It had a few different lyrics than the film's original lyrics. In 2005, Disney released the tenth anniversary edition of Pocahontas, which had the song fully animated and integrated into the film, but was an optional feature that the viewer could choose or watch the original theatrical version instead, due to seamless branching. It was performed by Mel Gibson (Captain Smith) and Judy Kuhn (Pocahontas) within the film's narrative. It was recorded for the original film in 1995. The audio version became available in 2015 for the Walt Disney Records: The Legacy Collection edition of the film's soundtrack."@en ;

Released as a single in 1998, it reached No. 2 on the Billboard Hot 100. The song was a worldwide success; it reached number four on both the UK Singles Chart and the New Zealand Singles Chart, as well as peaking atop the Australian singles chart and the Canadian Singles Chart, making it the group's highest-charting single across the world. The song is also the group's best-selling single in the United States, peaking at number two for one week behind TLC's \"No Scrubs\". Even though it only reached second place, the song did have great longevity on the chart, spending 16 weeks in the Top Ten and 35 weeks on the chart. At the end of 1999, Billboard ranked the song as the sixth best-selling single of 1999, ahead of a number of other No. 1 hits and the second highest rank for a song that didn't make it to the top, behind Whitney Houston, Faith Evans, and Kelly Price's \"Heartbreak Hotel\", which ranked at No. 4. It became the main theme song for the teen film She's All That starring Rachael Leigh Cook."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"L'Abbattimento dello Zeppelin\" (The felling of the Zeppelin) is a song by Italian progressive rock group Area, released as a single in 1973, to promote their Arbeit Macht Frei album. In the archival release \"Concerto Teatro Uomo\", Demetrio Stratos explains the birth of the song: \"Some of us, 10 years ago, used to work in ballrooms, and I remember a contract in one of them. The boss asked us 'Do you know how to play the song that goes like du-du-du-dum-dum' (hums Led Zeppelin's \"Whole Lotta Love\")? It's first in the charts' 'Well, actually no, we can't play that' 'OK, learn it, if you want to work here for a month'. So we learnt it and we did an arrangement of it, to make it resemble the least possible to the original. And then the owner of the ballroom fired us: 'no, it's not that, not good'. This song introduces, maybe for the first time ever, an onomatopoeia in the lyrics, a sound in the lyrics that expresses a concept.\"[citation needed] The flip-side on the record is the title track from the album, \"Arbeit Macht Frei\". This single failed to chart and both soungs would be included in 1977 in their \"Anto/Logicamente\" compilation, whose track selection focuses more on the tracks that were \"hidden, ignored by the critics and many others\"."@en ;

The medley combines the first verse of \"Never Too Far\", co-written and co-produced by Carey and Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis, with a re-recorded version of the first verse and bridge of \"Hero\", written and produced by Carey and Walter Afanasieff. As the latter did not receive co-production credits due to the change in instrumentation, Randy Jackson was named as producer alongside Carey instead. The single was meant to express a message of unity and love in the aftermath of the September 11 attacks. Though Carey did not promote Glitter (2001), due to her hospitalization, she embarked on a short promotional tour for the single, and attended several charitable events. Carey performed the medley live at the 2001 Radio Music Awards, British music program Top of the Pops, the United We Stand: What More Can I Give concert benefit, and her own special titled, At Home For The Holidays With Mariah Carey. Following the singles release, the song managed to attain a peak position of number eighty-one on the Billboard Hot 100, in light of all of Carey's live appearances. Though promoted throughout Europe, the single was never given an official release outside the United States, therefore failing to chart in any other significant global music market."@en ;

Robinson and Cleveland were the song's producers. It was recorded by the group on September 18, 1969. Point It Out has inspired a cover version by The Supremes and The Temptations. As with many Miracles hit tunes, \"Point It Out\" begins with Miracles member/ co-composer Marv Tarplin's guitar, while Robinson, as the song's narrator, explains the sheer joy of being in a new love relationship with a special lady, one so special that he simply can't think of a reason for not loving her: Unlike some Miracles songs, where the background vocalists' voices are partially obscured under the music, Miracles Bobby Rogers, Ronnie White, Pete Moore, and Claudette Rogers Robinson's voices are clearly audible in this song, giving it more of a \"group\" sound,their tight harmonies adding to the song's overall quality feel, while Robinson's trademark poetry and mastery with wordplay are clearly evident throughout. This song is the closest that The Miracles have come to pure Funk in any of their records. The song's \"B\" side, Darling Dear, was also a hit, reaching #100 on the Billboard Pop chart that same year. It has inspired a cover version by The Jackson Five, who in their career, covered many Miracles tunes, including Who's Loving You, (Come 'Round Here) I'm the One You Need, and \"The Love I Saw in You Was Just a Mirage\". Both songs have appeared on several Miracles' \"Greatest Hits\" CD compilations, including their 35th Anniversary Collection Box Set."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"Pop Diva\" (capitalized as \"POP DIVA\") is a song recorded by Japanese recording artist Kumi Koda for her ninth studio album Dejavu (2011). It was written by its producer Lil' Showy; this is Koda's first collaboration wit Lil' Showy. \"Pop Diva\" premiered on February 2, 2011 as the third and final from the album. The CD and digital cover sleeve has a body shot of Koda kneeling down, while the DVD cover has Koda with different clothing and pose. Koda's name, the song title, and the introduction lyrics are feature on the sleeve. The song is a fast-paced dance-pop song which uses the diva phrase to describe Koda's success and beauty. It contains elements of electropop and hip-hop, and employs heavy use of autotune and vocoder. Upon its release, critical reception towards \"Pop Diva\" has been positive; majority of the critics commended the chorus composition of the song. Minor criticism was aimed towards the lyrical content. In Japan, the song failed to reach the top spot and peaked at number three. It has sold over 40,000 units in Japan, and \"Pop Diva\" was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of Japan (RIAJ) for digital shipments of 100,000 units. A music video for \"Pop Diva\" was directed by Seki, and features Koda in a futuristic city. Based on the 2010 film Inception, the video has Koda asleep in a computer-generate room, flying on the rope of a helicopter, and fighting an masked enemy on a building rooftop. \"Pop Diva\" was included on the set list of the singer's 2011 Dejavu Live Tour, and the Premium Night: Love & Songs Tour. \"Pop Diva\" has been professionally remixed twice, and including on her remix albums Beach Mix (2012) and Koda Kumi Driving Hit's 5 (2013)."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"Pretty Hurts\" is a song recorded by American singer Beyonc\u00E9 for her eponymous fifth studio album (2013). It impacted mainstream radio in the United States on June 10, 2014, as the fourth single from the album. The song was written by Ammo, Beyonc\u00E9 and Sia, and its production was handled by the former two. \"Pretty Hurts\" was initially written for Katy Perry and then offered to Rihanna; both artists failed to record the track and as a result it was sent to Beyonc\u00E9 instead. It is a power pop, soul ballad, instrumentally complete with a sparse background honed with the use of synths, minor chords and a \"booming\" drum beat. The track's lyrical content deals with subjects of third-wave feminism, self-empowerment and body image. Additionally, the song's lyrics deal with the consequences of society's high standards of beauty, and in \"Pretty Hurts\" eating disorders are depicted as one of the subjected results. The song generally received acclaim from music critics who commended Beyonc\u00E9's vocal performance and the track's lyrical content. \"Pretty Hurts\" won in the category for Best Song with a Social Message at the 2014 MTV Europe Music Awards and was named the best track of 2014 by the Associated Press. Following the release of Beyonc\u00E9, the track charted in the lower regions internationally, and when released as a single, \"Pretty Hurts\" attained limited success commercially. It failed to enter the Billboard Hot 100 and peaked at number 63 on the UK Singles Chart. However, the song became Beyonc\u00E9's 21st number one on the US Hot Dance Club Songs chart, and was placed at number four on its 2014 year-end chart. The accompanying music video for \"Pretty Hurts\" was directed by Melina Matsoukas, and features Beyonc\u00E9 competing in a beauty pageant. The clip was made available at iTunes Stores as part of the album's release on December 13, 2013. The video was positively reviewed by critics who complimented Beyonc\u00E9's acting and the cohesion between the clip and the song's message. It won in the categories for Best Video with a Message and Best Cinematography at the 2014 MTV Video Music Awards. Rolling Stone included the clip in their year-end list of the 10 best music videos of 2014. Beyonc\u00E9 performed \"Pretty Hurts\" during her co-headlining On the Run Tour (2014)."@en ;

The song is a party jam about overzealous fans who pursue the group with demo tapes in their efforts to obtain an endorsement from the group. It was inspired by one overzealous fan in particular, Breakestra frontman Miles Tackett, who was shopping demo tapes to the group (note \"demo tapes by the miles\" in the song's subtitle). \"Ring Ring Ring (Ha Ha Hey)\" is credited as sampling the 1982 Fat Larry's Band song \"Act Like You Know\", but in fact it samples the 1981 The Whatnauts song \"Help Is on the Way\", which is sampled on \"Act Like You Know\". The song also includes a sample from \"Pass the Peas\" by The J.B.'s, written by J. Brown, C. Bobbit & J. Skarks. The chorus of \"Ring Ring Ring\" uses lyrics and melody from the Curiosity Killed the Cat song \"Name and Number\".

	dbo:abstract	"\"Saturday Night's Alright for Fighting\" (sometimes written \"Saturday Night's Alright (For Fighting)\") is a rock song performed by British musician Elton John. It was released as a single from his 1973 studio album Goodbye Yellow Brick Road. It has been covered by artists such as W.A.S.P., Flotsam and Jetsam, Nickelback (with Kid Rock and Dimebag Darrell), Queen, The Who, Fall Out Boy, and several others. The song is notable both for being one of John's most critically and commercially successful singles, becoming a #7 hit record in the singer's native United Kingdom, and for being one of the most aggressively bombastic, hard rock inspired tracks ever recorded by the artist. Featuring energetic, rapid-fire piano playing reminiscent of Jerry Lee Lewis, the track was composed along with John's long-time song-writing partner Bernie Taupin and has been a staple of the artist's live performances for many years, being played over 1,300 times live (making it one of John's top ten most performed tracks in his entire discography) as of December 2015."@en ;

It was written by Shellback and Savan Kotecha, and it was produced by Shellback. Musically, \"Want U Back\" is a dance-pop song, with elements of bubblegum and synthpop, while the lyrics are about a girl who's in denial of the fact that she's jealous that her ex-boyfriend has moved on to another girl. Even though she was apparently who the one who dumped him in the first place, she makes various attempts to sabotage her ex-boyfriend's new relationship. The song received acclaim from most music critics, some praised her sassy attitude on the song and labelled it \"infectious\". There are two videos for the song: the UK version and the US version. The UK video features Lloyd traipsing through old photographs with her former beau and some with his new girlfriend and wreaking havoc on the happy couple, while the U.S. version features Lloyd at a diner (Cadillac Jack's) wreaking havoc on her ex's new girlfriend. The song has reached number 3 on the New Zealand Singles Chart, number 18 on the Irish Singles Chart and number 25 on the UK Singles Chart.

	dbo:abstract	"\"Can't You See\" is a 1995 song by American R&B girl group Total, released as their debut single. The track was released from the New Jersey Drive Soundtrack and also later appeared on their debut album. After making their recording debut on his tracks \"Juicy\", \"One More Chance\" and \"One More Chance\" (Hip Hop Remix)\", The Notorious B.I.G. returned the favour with an intro rap verse to the song. The track was written and arranged by Terri & Monica's Terri Robinson, produced entirely by Sean \"Puffy\" Combs with instrumentation provided by associates Rashad Smith, Herb Middleton and Chucky Thompson and contains a sample from James Brown's \"The Payback\". The track was a success both on the mainstream US Billboard Hot 100 chart, reaching number thirteen and the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart, where it made number three. The song also peaked at number forty-three on the UK Singles Chart, where it charted for two weeks. The main edit to the track was the \"Bad Boy Remix\", which had the girls sing the original lyrics with a different vocal arrangement, The Notorious B.I.G.'s intro rap replaced by one from Keith Murray and its own music video. The track also had inserts of the girls acting as callers to a request line asking for the song to be played, saying such things as \"Hey, can you play that Total Remix?\". The vocals from this edit were also used on the \"So So Def Remix\" by Jermaine Dupri. The only remixes using the original track were those from funky house producer E-Smoove."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"Dress You Up\" is a song by American singer Madonna from her second studio album Like a Virgin (1984). It was released on July 24, 1985 as the album's final single, by Sire Records. The song was the last track to be added to the album as it was submitted late by songwriters Andrea LaRusso and Peggy Stanziale. Madonna pushed for the song's inclusion on Like a Virgin as she particularly liked its lyrics. Musically, the song is a drum beat driven dance track featuring instrumentation from guitars and vocals from a choir and a guitar solo played by Nile Rodgers, who also produced the song. The lyrics are an extended metaphor for fashion and sex, comparing dressing up with passion. A live performance from Madonna's first tour was used as the music video. Critics reacted positively to the dance-pop nature of the track. \"Dress You Up\" became Madonna's sixth consecutive top-five single in the United States. It also reached the top-ten in Australia, Belgium, Canada, Ireland, New Zealand and the United Kingdom. The song was performed on four of Madonna's concert tours, most recently on the Rebel Heart Tour (2015\u201316). \"Dress You Up\" was added to the \"Filthy Fifteen\" list of the Parents Music Resource Center, due to the sexual nature of its lyrics. The song has been covered in different forms by a number of artists."@en ;

It was the band's biggest well known hit, peaking at number six on the UK Singles Chart and at nine on the Irish Singles Chart. \"Hersham Boys\" was not a well favourite hit on Smash Hits, with music journalist David Hepworth describes the song as \"A tired, hollow effort struggling between weary attempts at rabble-rousing and blush-making pseudo-Springsteen 'street' songs that reek of desperation and contract fulfilling. As empty self-satisfied a record as anything they supposedly set out to replace\". The song is their biggest and most well-known hit and is included on live and compilation albums. The both B-side live version tracks \"I Don't Wanna (live)\" and \"Tell Us The Truth (live)\" appears on this single, which had recorded in 1978. The 7\" single is featured of the song on the bonus CD tracklist from their album. In the music video the Hersham sign that Pursey, the rest of Sham 69 and a young boy are sitting on is the sign for Hersham Road, a road in which consists of Rydens Secondary School, Bell Farm Primary School and a pub called The Royal George."@en ;

dbr:November_Spawned_a_Monster	rdf:type	dbo:MusicalWork ;
	dbo:abstract	"\"November Spawned a Monster\" is a song by Morrissey. It was released as a single in 1990. It was written by Morrissey and Clive Langer. It also features one of Morrissey's former colleagues from The Smiths, Andy Rourke. In reaching number 12 in the British chart it was a marked improvement over Morrissey's previous single, \"Ouija Board, Ouija Board\", but still failed to chart as high as the singer's first four releases. The track is one of Morrissey's personal favourites, and has been played live many times by the singer. It along with its b-side \"He Knows I'd Love to See Him\" appears on the compilation album Bona Drag. The song tackles the plight of the disabled, an unusual subject matter for a pop single. As ever with Morrissey the tone and sentiments are riddled with ambiguity. His use of words such as 'monster' and 'twisted' creates a strange mix of revulsion, sympathy and black comedy, all used to enlighten, and disturb, the audience. By forcing the ambivalent persona of tormentor and saviour, Morrissey forces the listener to confront their own prejudices head on.\" The song is quoting Les Chants de Maldoror (Chant 2, verse 7), in which a hermaphrodite perceives himself as a monster and dreams of love. In November 2014 Alex Broun's play November Spawned a Monster, inspired by Morrissey's song, premiered at The Old Fitzroy, in Sydney, Australia, directed by Robert Chuter (director) and starring James Wright."@en ;

It was released on November 20, 2012 by Interscope Records as the second single from the album, and sent to mainstream radio in the United States on November 27. The song was written by will.i.am, Jef Martens, Jaylien Wesley, and Jean Baptiste and was produced by Martens under the alias Lazy Jay, with additional production by will.i.am. \"Scream & Shout\" is an upbeat dance-pop song; its lyrics are about having a good time on a night out. It interpolates a sample of the lyric \"Britney, bitch\", which was used on Spears' 2007 single \"Gimme More\". \"Scream & Shout\" received mixed reviews from music critics. Some critics described the song as a dark club track, but others criticized the use of Auto-Tune on the vocals. The song was a commercial success worldwide, topping the charts in over 24 countries and reached the top ten in Australia, Sweden, and South Korea. In the United States, the song peaked at number three on the Billboard Hot 100 and became the first number one song of the newly established Dance/Electronic Songs chart. In the United Kingdom, \"Scream & Shout\" became will.i.am's second consecutive number one single, Spears' sixth number one and her first chart-topper since \"Everytime.\" An accompanying music video directed by Ben Mor was shot in October 2012, and premiered in the U.S. during a live episode of The X Factor on November 28. The theme of the music video is multiplicity, and critics complimented its futuristic setting. \"Scream & Shout\" also served as the theme song for a television commercial for Beats by Dr. Dre Color headphones. A remixed version of the song, featuring rappers Hit-Boy, Waka Flocka Flame, Lil Wayne and Sean Combs, was uploaded to will.i.am's official YouTube account on January 25, 2013, after it was leaked on the internet earlier the same day.

It went on to become a top 20 hit throughout Europe, and even reached the top 10 in some countries. The song fared even better the following year in the U.S. There, \"Shattered Dreams\" was released early in 1988 with a totally different music video, shot entirely in black and white and directed by David Fincher, which Datchler actually preferred. The single peaked at #2 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart and topped Billboard's Adult Contemporary chart for one week. A midtempo club remix of the track was released on 12\" vinyl. Billboard magazine ranked \"Shattered Dreams\" as the #26 song of the year 1988 in their December 31 issue. Clark Datchler and the group would soon part, and Datchler released an acoustic version of the song as a track on his 1990 Virgin solo single \"Crown of Thorns.\" He later re-recorded a slower version on his 2007 album \"Tomorrow\" in C minor.

The song's lyrics are about Brown falling in and out of love. \"She Ain't You\" received mixed to positive reviews from music critics. \"She Ain't You\" reached number five on the US Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart, number 17 on the US Pop Songs chart, and number 27 on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart.

It was released in February 1993 as the second single from Reba's album It's Your Call. The song reached the top of the Billboard Hot Country Singles & Tracks (now Hot Country Songs) chart. \"The Heart Won't Lie\" as told by Reba: \"Originally Kenny Rogers and I were looking at doing this song as a duet but we could never get it to sound just right because of the different ranges of our voices. Unfortunately, it just didn't work out. Later when I was working on a new CD, I remembered that song and called Kenny to see if he was recording it and if not, could I have it and he passed it along to me. We asked Vince Gill to sing the background harmonies on the song. Tony Brown, who was co-producing the CD with me, suggested letting Vince do more than just sing harmony on the song, so he took a couple of verses, and we decided to turn it into a duet. \"It worked out well in the end for everyone - except, I think, Vince. He doesn't really care for videos and this one turned into a four-day shoot. It was great to spend time with Vince and get to watch him do what he called his Gomer Pyle imitation for his character. But I had to promise him that if he ever does another song with me, he will never have to suffer through a four-day video shoot again!.\" The two performed the song on the 1992 Academy of Country Music Awards.

	dbo:abstract	"\"Walkampf\" (Whale struggle) is a song by Die Toten Hosen. It's the second single and the thirteenth track from the album Zur\u00FCck zum Gl\u00FCck. The title is a pun on the word \"Wahlkampf\", which means \"election campaign\" in German. The song is about a dream by the narrator, where he finds a whale on a beach and struggles to push it back to the water, but doesn't have enough strength for that. All the time, he hears the waves, the sun shouting: \"Push the whale back in the sea\", which pressures him. He hopes to get help from a Greenpeace ship he sees, but right before his eyes, it sinks. The next day he has sore muscles and gets under the shower but then his girlfriend urges him to \"push the whale back in the sea\" and on it goes. The song opens with a slow ukulele tune, progresses into a more aggressive punk style during the 2nd verse, with the bridge between the 2nd and third verse being overlaid with a background singer giving it a more surf rock style similar to a song by the Beach Boys, and the final verse and final chorus is accompanied by bagpipes, with the background singer returning at the very tail end of the song."@en ;

The song, originally performed in a more blues-oriented style, was inspired by artists such as Lead Belly and Big Bill Broonzy. Two versions of the song were recorded, with the second performance being used for the final single. Although it was rumoured that future Led Zeppelin guitarist Jimmy Page had performed the song's guitar solo, the myth has since been proven false. \"You Really Got Me\" was an early hit song built around power chords (perfect fifths and octaves), and heavily influenced later rock musicians, particularly in the genres of heavy metal and punk rock. Built around a guitar riff played by Dave Davies, the song's lyrics were described by Dave as \"a love song for street kids.\" \"You Really Got Me\" was released on 4 August 1964 as the group's third single, and reached number one on the UK singles chart the next month, remaining for two weeks. The song became the group's breakthrough hit; it established them as one of the top British Invasion acts in the United States, reaching number seven there later in the year. \"You Really Got Me\" was later included on the Kinks' debut album, Kinks. The song was covered by American rock band Van Halen in 1978, reaching the Billboard Top 40."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"Blurred Lines\" is a single written and performed by American recording artists Robin Thicke, T.I., and Pharrell Williams. Produced by Pharrell, it serves as the lead single from Thicke's album of the same name. It was released on March 26, 2013 through Pharrell's label Star Trak Recordings. Recorded in 2012, the song was primarily inspired by the Marvin Gaye song \"Got to Give It Up\", and was largely the work of Williams. However, Thicke clearly laid claim to writing credits on the track according to a Reuters article. The song became the subject of a bitter legal dispute with the family of Gaye and Bridgeport Music as to whether the song infringed copyrights to \"Got to Give It Up\". Thicke and Williams were found liable for copyright infringement by a federal jury in March 2015. The song's music video was released in two versions, with one featuring models Emily Ratajkowski, Jessi M'Bengue, and Elle Evans being topless, while the other censored nudity. The uncut version of the video was at one time removed from YouTube for violating the site's terms of service regarding nudity; it was later restored, but with an age restriction. The song's lyrics and music video have proven controversial with some groups, with claims that it is misogynistic and promotes date rape. This has led to the song being banned at universities and other institutions in the United Kingdom and prompted a rebuttal from Thicke. \"Blurred Lines\" was an immense success worldwide, peaking at number one in at least 25 countries and becoming the number one song of 2013 in several of them. It became Thicke's first, T.I.'s fourth, and Pharrell's third number-one single in the US, where it was also the longest running number one single of 2013. The song subsequently became one of the best-selling singles of all time, with sales of 14.8 million, simultaneously breaking the record for largest radio audience in history. The single was nominated for two Grammys at the 56th Annual Grammy Awards, including Record of the Year and Best Pop Duo/Group Performance.

	dbo:abstract	"\"I Can't Help Myself (Sugar Pie Honey Bunch)\" is a 1965 hit song recorded by the Four Tops for the Motown label. Written and produced by Motown's main production team Holland\u2013Dozier\u2013Holland, the song is one of the most well-known Motown tunes of the 1960s. The song reached number one on the R&B charts and was also the number-one song on the Billboard Hot 100 for two non-consecutive weeks, from June 12 to June 19 and from June 26 to July 3 in 1965. It replaced \"Back in My Arms Again\" by labelmates The Supremes, was first replaced by \"Mr. Tambourine Man\" by The Byrds, then regained the top spot before being replaced by \"(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction\" by The Rolling Stones. Billboard ranked the record as the No. 2 song of 1965. It was also the Four Tops first Top 40 single in the UK, reaching #23. The song finds lead singer Levi Stubbs, assisted by the other three Tops and The Andantes, pleadingly professing his love to a woman: \"Sugar pie, honey bunch/I'm weaker than a man should be!/Can't help myself/I'm a fool in love, you see.\" Like most of his lead parts, Stubbs' vocals are recorded in a tone that straddles the line between singing and shouting, similar to the tone of a black Baptist preacher. The melodic and chordal progressions are very similar to the Supremes' \"Where Did Our Love Go\". Allmusic critic Ed Hogan claims that the song uses the same chords as The Supremes' 1964 hit \"Where Did Our Love Go,\" also written by Holland-Dozier-Holland. Rolling Stone magazine ranked the song #415 on their list of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time. It has been covered extensively since 1965, including versions done for several television commercials."@en ;

Included on the group's 1972 album A Lonely Man, \"Oh Girl\" centers on a relationship on the verge of break-up. The narrator, portrayed by the song's author Eugene Record, expresses concern that the break-up may prove unbearable for him (\"Oh girl/I'd be in trouble if you left me now/'Cause I don't know where to look for love/I just don't know how\"), while knowing that staying will be no better (\"I could save myself a lot of useless tears/Girl I've got to get away from here\"; \"Better be on my way, I can't stay here\"). \"Oh Girl\" was the Chi-Lites' first and only number-one single on the Billboard Hot 100, peaking at that position in May 1972 for one week. The single also reached the top position of the Billboard R&B Singles chart the following month, remaining in that position for two weeks. Billboard ranked it as the No. 13 song for 1972. In addition, it reached number fourteen on the UK Singles Chart in July 1972. The instrument featured in the song could be a melodica.[citation needed]"@en ;

dbr:Anotherloverholenyohead	rdf:type	dbo:MusicalWork ;
	dbo:abstract	"\"Anotherloverholenyohead\" is a 1986 song by Prince and The Revolution, from the album Parade, the soundtrack to the film Under the Cherry Moon. The song is essentially a full band performance by Prince & the Revolution, with backing vocals from Susannah Melvoin, and the horn section of Eric Leeds and Atlanta Bliss. The song also features a string arrangement by Clare Fischer. The song is set in a minor key, and written around a piano chord sequence, although the arrangement emphasizes an upfront guitar synth and a drum machine. The lyrics are about a man trying to reclaim a lover who is intent on leaving him for another. The song's title is a combination of the main idea of the song, and the line \"U need another lover like u need a hole in yo head\" from the chorus. The single received a 12\" extended release with intricate piano work and some dance commands from Prince. The B-side was the LP version of \"Girls & Boys\" in the US, but since that was already released as a single on its own in the UK, the B-side there was \"I Wanna Be Your Lover\", from 1979's Prince. Despite a large amount of publicity provided by its predecessors and the film Under the Cherry Moon, the single stalled at number 63 on the Billboard Hot 100 in the US."@en ;

dbr:Mein_Herz_brennt	rdf:type	dbo:MusicalWork ;
	dbo:abstract	"\"Mein Herz brennt\" (German for \"My heart burns\") is a single by German industrial metal band Rammstein. The song first appeared as the opening song to the band's third album Mutter in 2001, and was used as the opening track for concerts during that era. In 2011 it appeared on the band's first greatest hits compilation titled Made in Germany 1995\u20132011, being the only song on the album that at the time of release had not been released as a single or had a music video. It was announced on November 22, 2012 that the song would be released as a single to promote the then-upcoming video collection Videos 1995\u20132012. A piano version of the song was released as a single on 7 December 2012. The song's lyrics involve a narrator describing the terrors of nightmares. The opening line of the song's intro and chorus (Nun, liebe Kinder, gebt fein Acht. Ich habe euch etwas mitgebracht, meaning \"Now, dear children, pay attention. I have brought something for you\") is taken from the 1950s German children's TV show Das Sandm\u00E4nnchen (The Little Sandman). Every night the show would come on and Das Sandm\u00E4nnchen would tell bedtime stories. This may entail the song's narrator being a darker version of the title character."@en ;

The version on the single is slightly longer than the version on the album, as there is a short introduction where Danny Goffey can be heard setting off fireworks. However, this introduction is heard at the end of \"Evening of the Day\", the sixth track on Life on Other Planets. The Children of the Monkey Basket website explains the song in further detail; \"First release of the century and what a corker. We had the main riff for this kicking around for about five years and ended up recording it third for the new album [Life On Other Planets].

Released following a highly publicized campaign by Yayo's record label, G-Unit Records, to release Yayo from a prison sentence being served prior to the song's release, \"So Seductive\" is an uptempo \"club banger\" containing elements of string instruments and a repetitive bassline in its instrumentation. The song received little promotion from Yayo at the time of its release, as he was still under house arrest following the end of his prison sentence, although he has since performed the song during various live performances. \"So Seductive\" became Yayo's most commercially successful song, reaching number 48 on the US Billboard Hot 100; it also remains Yayo's only song to chart outside the United States, peaking in the top 30 of the Irish and United Kingdom singles charts. The song received generally positive reviews from music critics, who complimented its energy and 50 Cent's performance in the chorus, although some wrote negatively towards Yayo's rapping and also noted a lack of originality in the song's production. \"So Seductive\" was nominated for best \"Club Banger\" at the 2005 Vibe Awards, but lost to \"1 Thing\" by Amerie."@en ;

dbr:Jack_Names_the_Planets	rdf:type	dbo:MusicalWork ;
	dbo:abstract	"\"Jack Names the Planets\" is a song by Ash. It was their first official single release in February 1994. The single was originally released on vinyl only and is entirely different from the album version that appears on their EP, Trailer. The single was re-released in a limited edition 2002 on 2 December in CD format with and the Raptor 12\" version of \"Season\" as an extra B-side, as part of the promotion for the Intergalactic Sonic 7\u2033s greatest hits collection. The song first appeared on the Shed demo tape, recorded in 1992 and again on the Garage Girl and Pipe Smokin' Brick demo-tapes. Ash were first signed when a copy of Garage Girl was given to Stephen 'Tav' Tavner, who signed them on the basis of \"Jack Names the Planets\". Only 2,000 copies of the single were released, and the single was recorded on a \u00A3300 budget. However, the band was unhappy with the version released on the 1994 single, and re-recorded it for their first album. The title of the track is taken from a chapter of the Stephen King and Peter Straub novel, The Talisman. This book is further referenced in some of the lyrics. The single's B-side, \"Don't Know\", first appeared on the Garage Girl demo tape. In 1995, the song appeared on the soundtrack for the film Angus. Clips from the movie were interspersed with footage of Ash performing as figures in moving posters for the video of \"Jack Names the Planets\", which was also released in 1995. Phil Harder directed the video. The first 50,000 pressings of Ash's first full-length album, 1977, began with \"Jack Names the Planets\" and \"Don't Know\" as hidden tracks found by rewinding the CD, before the usual opener \"Lose Control\". \"Jack Names the Planets\" also appeared on Ash's first greatest hits collection Intergalactic Sonic 7\u2033s, and is considered a fan and band favourite. It is rare not to be included in the band's live setlist. During the spoken section at the beginning of the song, two Dutchmen, Oscar \"Wilde\" Vermeer and Patrick \"The Brewer\" Schrama (who met Tim Wheeler during a holiday in France), suggest that the song should have been called \"Jack Names The Planet Nieuw-Vennep\", given that, in their opinion, \"Nieuw-Vennep\" is a good name for a planet. Nieuw-Vennep is a town of thirty thousand inhabitants in the west of Holland, midway between The Hague and Amsterdam."@en ;

It was released on 1 July 1977 as the band's third single and was later featured on their only album, Never Mind the Bollocks, Here's the Sex Pistols, released that same year. The song reached number 6 on the UK Singles Chart and marked the band's first appearance on the British music show Top of the Pops. The song gained attention for vocalist John Lydon's phrasing of the word \"vacant\", emphasising the last syllable to sound like the vulgar word \"cunt\". According to bassist Glen Matlock, the song's main riff was inspired by hearing \"S.O.S.\" by ABBA. The B-side of the single was a cover of The Stooges' \"No Fun\", which the band played on the spot without a proper rehearsal. It was taken from demo sessions recorded by producer Dave Goodman. The band made a video of \"Pretty Vacant\" (as well as one for \"God Save the Queen\") on 11 & 12 July 1977 at the studios of ITN in Wells Street, London. They were thrown out after throwing cans of lager at the cameramen on the 11th, but came back on the 12th to finish the recording. NME magazine made it their Single of the Year in 1977. In March 2005, Q magazine placed the song at number 26 in its list of the 100 Greatest Guitar Tracks. NME named it the 132nd greatest song of all time in 2014. The album was reissued as a 2-CD set in 1992. A live version of the track from Filthy Lucre Live was released as a single in 1996, and a 7\" picture disc was released in 2012."@en ;

The song was written by the band's lead singer, guitarist, and songwriter, John Fogerty. The song is included on their 1970 album Cosmo's Factory, the group's fifth album, which was also their fifth and final No. 2 Billboard hit. It was certified Gold and in the early 1990s was also certified Platinum. In 2003 Cosmo's Factory was ranked 265 on Rolling Stone's list of 500 greatest albums of all time. However, the album signaled the decline and subsequent end for the band. \"Lookin' Out My Back Door\" was a direct tribute to the Bakersfield Sound, a form of music that influenced John Fogerty and the Creedence sound. Buck Owens, one of the architects of the Bakersfield Sound, is even mentioned in the song's lyrics."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"Joan of Arc (Maid of Orleans)\" is a song by British band Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark (OMD) and was the third single released from their third studio album Architecture & Morality. The track has been described by OMD frontman Andy McCluskey as the group's \"Mull of Kintyre\". To prevent confusion with their previous single \"Joan of Arc\", the song was retitled \"Maid of Orleans (The Waltz Joan of Arc)\" for its single release. Both songs are about the French heroine Joan of Arc and both reached the Top 5 of the UK Singles Chart\u2014although this single was more successful internationally, topping the charts in several countries including Germany, where it was the biggest-selling single of 1982. It also hit number 5 in Ireland and number 7 in New Zealand. The song was used during the climax and closing credits to the final episode of the second series of Ashes to Ashes. Ned Raggett in AllMusic has described the song as \"epic\", concluding: \"With another bravura McCluskey lead and a mock-bagpipe lead that's easily more entrancing than the real thing, it's a wrenching ballad like no other before it and little since.\" In 1989, Radio Veronica listeners voted \"Maid of Orleans\" the 60th greatest song of all time. In 1991, MTV Europe named the single's accompanying video as the 37th best ever made. The single was the last release on the Dindisc label."@en ;

The song was written by Juan Carlos Calder\u00F3n and produced by Miguel.

The song debuted in the Billboard Top Latin Songs chart (formerly Hot Latin Tracks) chart at number 13 the week of October 9, 1999, climbing to the top five the following week. At the week of November 6, 1999, the song garnered 18.7 million audience impressions in the United States, leading to its peak at number-one for one week, 26 months after Miguel's last chart topper, \"Por Debajo de la Mesa\" in 1997, making him the performer with most number-one hits in the chart (13, not counting \"Ahora Te Puedes Marchar\" in 1987), surpassing Mexican singer-songwriter Marco Antonio Sol\u00EDs and Spanish performer Enrique Iglesias, each of whom had achieved 10 number-one hits at the time. With this number-one placement, Miguel accumulated 57 weeks at the top of the chart, tying with Iglesias. \"O T\u00FA o Ninguna\" replaced \"D\u00EDmelo\" by Marc Anthony at the top of the Hot Latin Songs chart and was succeeded by \"Llegar a Ti\" by American singer Jaci Velasquez."@en ;

It was written by Sergio Galoyan, Trevor Horn, Martin Kierszenbaum, Elena Kiper and Valeriy Polienko, while production was by Horn. \"All The Things She Said\" is the English-language version of their 1999 single \"Ya Soshla S Uma\". \"All The Things She Said\" received mixed reviews from music critics, while some commended the production and lyrical content, others called it a gimmick and suggestive. The song reached number one in several countries around the world, including Australia, Austria, France, New Zealand, Switzerland and the UK. \"All The Things She Said\" reached number twenty on the US Billboard Hot 100, the first Russian act to accomplish this. Ivan Shapovalov commissioned the accompanying music video for the single, which shows the group behind a fence in school uniforms, trying to escape. The music video caused considerable controversy in several nations because it depicted themes of lesbianism. Several organisations protested the video to be banned, while some music stations removed the scene with the girls kissing. The song had been performed many times, including on many MTV live shows, along with a megamix with \"Not Gonna Get Us\" at the MTV Movie Awards."@en .

The lyrics refer to an employee doing the same menial daily tasks, and wanting to get away from it all. Grant once said that the distorted vocal emulates that of a tannoy in a supermarket. The Dandy Warhols 2003 hit \"We Used to Be Friends\" duplicates the bassline from the track. Feeder's Grant Nicholas was given a co-writer credit on the single and the corresponding album. The track along with its video appeared at #70 on VH2's \"Indie 500\" rundown of 2004,[citation needed] which was a list of the channels top 500 indie tracks of all time.

	dbo:abstract	"\"Diamonds and Pearls\" is the title track to Prince and The New Power Generation's 1991 hit album. The song is an upbeat ballad, given a rock edge with guitar and heavy drumming. The song also features the vocals of NPG member Rosie Gaines. The ballad is an expression of love and not lust, as is the theme on some of the other singles from the album. The song was a top 10 hit, reaching #3 in the U.S. and the top spot on the R&B charts. The infamous pearls in the music video come from Connie Parente, a Los Angeles jewelry collector and designer. The B-side is a mix of excerpts of other Diamonds and Pearls tracks, which serves to promote the album. There was no extended version of the song released. The UK B-side included some of the mixes on the \"Cream\" maxi single. The repeated lyric \"If I gave you diamonds and pearls, would you be a happy boy or a girl?\" echoes the lyrics \"I'll buy you diamonds and pearls only if you're good girl\" from Prince's 1982 song, \"International Lover\". Rapper Lil Wayne sampled the song on his mixtape Da Drought, with the term \"Diamonds & Girls\". Polish jazz pianist Marcin Wasilewski and his trio included an instrumental version of the song on their 2008 ECM album January."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"Evil on Your Mind\" is the name of a popular Country music song, originally made famous by Grand Ole Opry star Jan Howard in 1966. In the mid-'60s, Jan Howard was not acquiring any significant hits. Only one of her songs hit the Top 20: in 1960, \"The One You Slip Around With\" hit No. 13. In 1966, Howard wrote and released her first single of the year, \"Evil on Your Mind\". The song was written by her husband at the time, songwriter Harlan Howard. The song hit the Top 5 on the Billboard Country music charts, peaking at No. 5 there. An album of the same name was released that year, featuring Howard's big hit. A successful follow-up single entitled \"Bad Seed\" hit the Top 10 that year. The song set the stage for a number of Top 20 and Top 10 hits that Howard would have as a solo and duet artist between 1966 and 1971. The song talks about a husband trying to convince his wife to visit her sister out west, but the narrator (the wife) notices that something is going on, which her husband is trying to hide. She believes he is thinking of having an affair, which she calls \"evil on your mind\". The song has been featured in the book Heartaches By the Number: The 500 Greatest Country Singles. A rock music group named The Stumbleweeds recorded Howard's \"Evil on Your Mind\". An answer song version was recorded by Burl Ives as \"Evil Off My Mind\" and became a modest country hit later that year, peaking at #47 in Billboard. The Ives record was one of the handful of answer songs by a male vocalist to a female star's hit; generally it was the other way around. Ella Fitzgerald recorded this song on her 1968 Capitol recording \"Misty Blue\", where it is attributed to Harlan Howard of Wilderness Music."@en ;

It was released as the B-side of their Billboard Top 40 hit, \"What's So Good About Goodbye\", and was included on their album I'll Try Something New the following year. This sad, melancholy ballad charted #103 on the Billboard Pop chart. Despite its relatively modest chart placing, this song has been hugely influential, and is noted as Beatle John Lennon's favorite Miracles tune, and was the inspiration behind The Beatles' song, \"Sexy Sadie\". Written by Miracles lead singer Smokey Robinson, the song begins with the lyric, \"Look what you've done...You've made a fool out of someone...\" which Lennon later paraphrased in his song as, \"What have you done...You've made a fool of everyone.\" The song was performed live by the group on their album, The Miracles Recorded Live on Stage, and has inspired cover versions by Marshall Crenshaw, Joe Meek, The Temptones, Ray, Goodman & Brown (The Moments), The Ones, and fellow Motown artists, Brenda Holloway, and The Temptations. The Temptations' version would also be released as a \"B\" side and would chart at #124 on the Pop charts in 1967 (as well be released on their 1966 album Gettin' Ready). In addition to being on their first Live album, The Miracles' original version of \"I've Been Good to You\" actually appears on two other of their early 1960s albums; 1962's I'll Try Something New, and 1963's The Fabulous Miracles."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"If I Could Give All My Love (Richard Manuel Is Dead)\" is a single by the American rock band Counting Crows. It is the fourth track on their fourth album, Hard Candy (2002). The inspiration from the song, according to Adam Duritz, came from the sense of \"not lasting\" he felt when he went to bed and read a newspaper that stated Richard Manuel, a founding member of The Band, had died of an apparent suicide. Manuel was a pianist, vocalist, and initially, the primary songwriter in the group, who suffered from bouts of depression\u2014all abilities and traits shared by Duritz. Duritz stated that the sense of impermanence was \"overwhelming\" and 15 years after the death of Manuel this sense inspired him to write the song. About this song, Duritz said: \u201DThis is about a thing that happened about 15 years ago when I was out all night with my friends drinking. I came home about six in the morning with this girl and got the morning paper on the way in the house and I opened it up and it turned out that Richard Manuel had died. He was the piano player and one of the singers for The Band. And I was a huge fan, you know? They were a big deal to me. And I kinda went to bed that morning thinking about how this thing that I had always loved was gone now. It\u2019s like John Lennon dying, there\u2019s not going to be anymore Beatles reunions, for sure. There\u2019s not going to be any Band reunions. And I was thinking this girl will probably be gone sometime soon too, you know, things just come and go in life. When were starting recording, we started writing, and we wrote this song. It\u2019s just sort of about how you can\u2019t hold on to anything in your life (your idols, the music you love, some girl, anything at all) a lot of times because you can\u2019t give all of yourself. And this is called Richard Manuel is Dead.\u201D"@en ;

It is the eighth track and third single from the band's second and final studio album, Grinderman 2, and was released on 14 March 2011 on Mute Records. Produced by Nick Launay and written collectively by vocalist Nick Cave, multi-instrumentalist Warren Ellis, bassist Martyn P. Casey and drummer Jim Sclavunos, the song has been described as an \"atypically straightforward love song\" and was written for Cave's wife, Susie Bick. Grinderman was accused of plagiarism by Frankie Duffy, the frontman of the defunct Scottish rock band Rising Signs, upon \"Palace of Montezuma\" inclusion on Grinderman 2. Duffy claimed the song was a rip-off of the Rising Signs' 2005 song \"Grey Man,\" however, Nick Cave denied the claims. Upon its single release, \"Palaces of Montezuma\" received positive critical acclaim, though the song failed to chart."@en ;

The single marked a commercial renaissance for the band in their native UK, becoming their first Top 10 hit since 1984's \"Locomotion\". The song pays homage to two rock groups: firstly to The Velvet Underground, with the song \"Sister Ray\" being directly referenced (OMD had previously covered \"I'm Waiting for the Man\" as a B-side to 1980 single \"Messages\"); and secondly to The Who, with the line \"people try to drag us down\" being near-identical in melody and lyrical content to the opening line of \"My Generation\". Critic Dave Thompson in AllMusic lauded the song as \"a glorious musical m\u00E9lange, an inspired melding of synth pop soar, 2-Tone yore, and glam rock roar, the anthemic chorus to the fore with a fist-in-the-air punch that shouts out for more.\" MTV Europe ranked \"Sailing on the Seven Seas\" as the 21st greatest song of 1991."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"That's What Love Is Made Of was a 1964 hit song by Motown's original vocal group, The Miracles, issued on the label's Tamla records subsidiary (Tamla 54102). It was taken from the group's album Greatest Hits from the Beginning, but originally appeared on their abortive 1964 album, I Like It Like That. Written by Miracles members Smokey Robinson, Bobby Rogers, and Pete Moore, this song was a BillboardTop 40 Pop hit, peaking at # 35, and a Top 10 Billboard R&B hit, peaking at # 9.A showcase for poetic word-play, The Miracles utilized several famous nursery rhymes in this song . In fact, the song's title itself is a variation of the rhyme : \"What Are Little Girls/Little Boys Made Of?\" . Parts of this famous rhyme were incorporated into the lyrics of this song, which, like many Miracles songs,starts with the guitar licks of Miracles member Marv Tarplin:Smokey, as the lead singer,serves as the song's narrator:\" You take Sugar and Spice...Everything Nice... and you've got a little girl,yeah,yeah...You take Snakes and Snails....Puppy Dog's tails...and you've got a little boy , yeah,yeah...That's what Love Is Made Of....\" The song illustrates that love is never easy, consisting of good times and bad times, heartbreak, and jubilation, breakups and makeups ...\"That's What Love is Made Of\" . While Marv plays and Smokey sings the lyrics, the other Miracles, Bobby, Ron, Pete, and Claudette, answer in classic call-and-response style. The Miracles performed this song before a live audience at the Santa Monica Civic Auditorium on the 1964 American International Pictures film, The T.A.M.I. Show. Present on stage were Smokey, Marv, Bobby, Ronnie, and Pete. Although present on the original recording, Miracle Claudette (Mrs.Smokey) Robinson, was not present at the concert, as she had retired from live on-stage performances earlier that year for health reasons. The Miracles' That's What Love Is Made Of has inspired cover versions by Michael Jackson, Bobby Vee, Choker Campbell, and The Magicians, and has appeared on many Miracles \"Greatest Hits albums and CD Anthologies. The song's flip side was the popular regional Miracles hit tune, Would I Love You, which also appears on several Miracles \"Greatest Hits\" album and CD compilations."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"The Reincarnation of Benjamin Breeg\" is a song by Iron Maiden from their 14th studio album, A Matter of Life and Death. The song is the leading single from the album, released on 14 August 2006. The CD single comes with a B-side of \"Hallowed Be Thy Name\" from the BBC Radio 1 Legends Session. Due to the overall length of the two songs, the single was not eligible for chart inclusion in the UK. The single was also released on 10\" clear vinyl single, which includes BBC Sessions versions of \"The Trooper\" and \"Run to the Hills\" on the B-side. For the EU pressing of the 10\" vinyl the sleeve and labels state that it should be played at 33.3 RPM. This is actually incorrect and the correct playing speed is 45 RPM. The USA issue plays correctly at 33.3 RPM. A promotional version of the single was released on 14 August 2006, featuring the full version and a shorter version called \"edited version\" in the US promo CD and \"rock club mix\" in the UK promo CD (both versions are identical). The single was not allowed to have a place in the UK charts because the overall music time on the CD exceeded the time limit for it to be classed as a single. On 17 July 2006, a music video for the song was uploaded on the band's official website. It had initially been released only for paying fan club members, but it was leaked within minutes and viewed by many fans who posted the link on various Iron Maiden discussion forums. The video displays them performing in the studio along with classic photos and clips of the band over their lengthy career. The guitar solo in \"The Reincarnation of Benjamin Breeg\" is played by Dave Murray."@en ;
