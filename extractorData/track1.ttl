After her years in exile, the September 11th attacks inspired Jackson to write \"Free the World\". She recorded and performed it for friends, who immediately fell in love with it. This led to the revival of Jackson's 25-year-old music career. This song led Jackson to begin work on her Startin' Over album, which included the 2004 Billboard chart hit \"Just Wanna Dance\" as the lead single. \"Free the World\" was released as a follow-up and charted in March 2005. The single peaked at #24 on the Billboard Hot Dance Club Play charts. The song is an appeal to free the world from segregation, discrimination and years of war. VH1 described the ballad as the \"most appropriate song for the world.\" About.com dubbed Jason Randolph's remix a \"trippily hypnotic treat\" with a \"churning rhythm track and mesmerizing synth.\""@en ;

Re-recorded and re-mixed by Ian Gore for the band's 2006 debut album The Freedom Spark, a new version of the song was released on 11 September 2006 through Warner. A live favourite, the song is notable for contrasting some of the band's most catchy and light-hearted bluegrass music with disturbing lyrics, apparently concerning a country stroll that ends in the discovery of a child rape victim."@en ;

dbr:Here_Without_You	rdf:type	dbo:MusicalWork ;
	dbo:abstract	"\"Here Without You\" is a song recorded by American rock band 3 Doors Down. It was released in August 2003 as the third single from the album Away from the Sun. It peaked at number five on the Billboard Hot 100 for the week ending November 8, 2003. Only their songs \"Kryptonite\" and \"When I'm Gone\" reached higher positions on the chart, peaking at #3 and #4 respectively. It has since been certified 2x Platinum in the United States and Platinum in Australia. While the Mainstream Rock and Modern Rock were the main formats for 3 Doors Down, it wasn't expected to be a big success, the song was a moderate success hitting #14 on the Mainstream Rock Tracks and #22 on the Modern Rock Tracks, it failed to top or reach #1 on both charts due to its soft rock ballads in the song compared to its original post-grunge sounds from their other songs including their 4 previous rock and alternative hits Kryptonite, Loser, Duck and Run, and When I'm Gone, but it still became a big hit making it their 3rd #1 Top 40 Mainstream hit and their 1st #1 Adult Top 40 hit for 13 consecutive weeks. After that, the song was played only on pop and adult contemporary stations, this song was not played on rock radio unlike their previous hits. The song grew in popularity following the start of the Iraq War, and became an anthem for deployed troops and their families and friends at home."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"Love the One You're With\" is a 1970 single by folk rocker Stephen Stills. The first release from his solo debut Stephen Stills, it peaked at No. 14 in the Billboard Hot 100. A live version by Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young appears on their album 4 Way Street. A solo version by Stills appears on the Crosby, Stills and Nash CD Demos. Stills wrote the song after being inspired by the tag line -- \"If you can't be with the one you love, love the one you're with\" which was a frequent remark by musician Billy Preston. Stills asked him for permission to use the line in a song and Preston agreed immediately.[citation needed] Of course Preston, himself, may have taken the idea from Harburg and Lane\u2019s \u201CWhen I\u2019m Not Near the Girl I Love, I Love the Girl I\u2019m Near\u201D, from the 1947 Broadway show Finian\u2019s Rainbow; it was sung by Tommy Steele in the 1968 film version."@en ;
