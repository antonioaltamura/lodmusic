dbr:Sister_Morphine	rdf:type	dbo:MusicalWork ;
	dbo:abstract	"\"Sister Morphine\" is a song written by Mick Jagger, Keith Richards, and Marianne Faithfull. Faithfull released a version of the song as the b-side to her 1969 single \"Something Better\" on Decca Records, 21 February 1969. Although sung live to a backing track by Faithfull at The Rolling Stones Rock and Roll Circus, that film was never televised and \"Something Better\" did not hit the UK chart, an estimated 500 copies only being issued by Decca. A different version was released two years later by The Rolling Stones as a track on their 1971 album Sticky Fingers. It was originally credited solely to Jagger and Richards, but after a legal battle Faithfull retained her rights as a co-author, acknowledged by the 1994 Virgin Records reissue of the Stones' album catalogue from Sticky Fingers through Steel Wheels. The personnel for the Faithfull version is herself on vocals, Jagger on acoustic guitar, Ry Cooder on slide guitar and bass, Jack Nitzsche on piano and organ, and Charlie Watts on drums. The Stones' version has Jagger on vocals, Richards on acoustic guitar and backing vocals, Cooder and Nitzche again on slide guitar and piano respectively, Bill Wyman on bass, and Watts again on drums. Faithfull recorded the song again in 1979, during the sessions for her Broken English album; this version was subsequently released on a 12\" single, and appears as a bonus track on the second disc of the 2013 deluxe edition of the album. A chapter of the 1978 book Babel by Patti Smith is entitled \"Sister Morphine,\" and the song is referenced in the 1982 novel The Transmigration of Timothy Archer by Philip K. Dick."@en ;

dbr:Everytime	rdf:type	dbo:MusicalWork ;
	dbo:abstract	"\"Everytime\" is a song by American recording artist Britney Spears, taken from her fourth studio album, In the Zone (2003). It was released on May 10, 2004 by Jive Records as the third single from the album. After her relationship with American singer Justin Timberlake ended in 2002, she made friends with her backing vocalist Annet Artani. They started writing songs together at Spears's house in Los Angeles, and then traveled to Lombardy, Italy, where \"Everytime\" was written. Spears composed the music and she developed the lyrics with Artani. According to Artani, the song was written as a response to Timberlake's 2002 song \"Cry Me a River\". Spears has neither confirmed nor denied these allegations. \"Everytime\" is considered a pop ballad with breathy vocals. Its lyrics are a plea for forgiveness for inadvertently hurting a former lover. The song received general acclaim, with critics complimenting its haunting lyrics and the organic feel of the song in comparison with most of the tracks on its host album. Spears' maturity in the production and her songwriting abilities were also complimented. The song has been named one of Spears' best ballads. \"Everytime\" was a commercial success, peaking inside the top five in most countries, while reaching the top of the charts in Australia, Hungary, Ireland and the United Kingdom. In the U.S. it was a top 20 hit, peaking at number 15 on Billboard Hot 100. Spears performed \"Everytime\" in a series of live appearances such as television shows Saturday Night Live and Top of the Pops. She has also performed the song on piano in a flowered-themed setting at The Onyx Hotel Tour (2004), while suspended on a giant umbrella at The Circus Starring Britney Spears (2009) and in an angel costume at Britney: Piece of Me (2013). \"Everytime\" has been covered by artists such as Glen Hansard and Kelly Clarkson, and was used in the film Spring Breakers (2013). Inspired by the cinematography of Leaving Las Vegas, the music video for \"Everytime\" portrays Spears as a star hounded by paparazzi, who drowns in her bathtub when she starts bleeding from a wound in her head. In the hospital, doctors fail to resuscitate her while a child is born in the next room, implying she has been reincarnated. The original treatment would have had Spears killing herself from a drug overdose, but the plot was removed after it received criticism by organizations such as Kidscape, who perceived it as a glamorization of suicide. Critics noted the video for its religious references to The Passion of the Christ, Kabbalah and stigmata, and for predicting Spears's future struggles with fame."@en ;

It was released on May 10, 2003 as the debut single off his debut album Jackpot (2003). The song received positive reviews from critics who praised the production and Chingy's addictive delivery. \"Right Thurr\" was kept from being number one by Beyonc\u00E9's \"Crazy in Love\", staying at number 2 on the Billboard Hot 100 for four consecutive weeks, giving him his first of three top 5 hits on that chart. It also became a number-one hit on the Hot Rap Songs chart for four weeks and peaked at numbers 2 and 5 on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs and Mainstream Top 40 charts respectively. The song also reached number one in New Zealand and charted in other countries like Australia, Canada and the UK. The song was certified Gold by the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) and the Canadian Recording Industry Association (CRIA).

dbr:Mein_Teil	rdf:type	dbo:MusicalWork ;
	dbo:abstract	"Mein Teil (German: \"My share\", \"My part\" or slang for \"My penis\") is the first single by the German industrial metal band Rammstein from their fourth album Reise, Reise. The song is inspired by the case of Armin Meiwes and Bernd J\u00FCrgen Armando Brandes. In March 2001, in Rotenburg an der Fulda, the two men aged in their 40s met each other, cut off and cooked Brandes' penis and consumed it together. Afterwards, Meiwes killed Brandes \u2014 with Brandes' permission \u2014 and ate his remains. As a result, Meiwes was sentenced to eight-and-a-half years in jail for manslaughter, but was later charged with murder and sentenced to life imprisonment. A prominent phrase in the song is \"... denn du bist, was du isst, und ihr wisst, was es ist\" (\"Because you are what you eat, and you (pl.) know what it is\"). According to bassist Oliver \"Ollie\" Riedel, the song came about after \"one of our members brought a newspaper to rehearsal and it had a story about the cannibal guy in it. We were fascinated, shocked and amused at the same time\". Vocalist Till Lindemann stated, \"It is so sick that it becomes fascinating and there just has to be a song about it\". \"Mein Teil\" attracted controversy in Germany; the media dubbed it \"Das Kannibalenlied\" (\"The Cannibal-Song\"), which helped to boost it to second place in the German music charts after its release in early August 2004. Remixes of the song were done by Arthur Baker and the Pet Shop Boys. At the beginning of the song in the video, the phrase \"Suche gut gebauten Achtzehn- bis Drei\u00DFigj\u00E4hrigen zum Schlachten \u2013 Der Metzgermeister\" (\"Looking for a well built 18- to 30-year-old to slaughter \u2013 The Master Butcher\") is spoken, voiced by Ollie, although the album version of the song does not have this beginning. The quote is taken from an online post by Armin Meiwes. \"Mein Teil\" was nominated for Best Metal Performance at the 48th Grammy Awards but lost to Slipknot's \"Before I Forget\"."@en ;

dbr:All_Those_Years_Ago	rdf:type	dbo:MusicalWork ;
	dbo:abstract	"\"All Those Years Ago\" is a song by English musician George Harrison, released as a single from his 1981 album Somewhere in England. Having previously recorded the music for the song, Harrison tailored the lyrics to serve as a personal tribute to his former Beatles bandmate John Lennon, following the latter's murder on 8 December 1980. The recording also includes performances by ex-Beatles Ringo Starr, on drums, and Paul McCartney, who overdubbed backing vocals onto the basic track. Released in May 1981, the single spent three weeks at number 2 on the US Billboard Hot 100, and peaked at number 13 on the UK Singles Chart. In addition, it topped Canada's RPM singles chart and spent one week at number 1 on Billboard's Adult Contemporary listings. \"All Those Years Ago\" was the first time that Harrison, McCartney and Starr had appeared on the same recording since the Beatles' \"I Me Mine\" in 1970, and the last time they would appear together until \"Free As a Bird\", in 1995. Other musicians performing on the track include Al Kooper and Ray Cooper. The song has appeared on the Harrison compilations Best of Dark Horse 1976\u20131989 and Let It Roll, and a live version recorded in 1991 with Eric Clapton was included on Harrison's Live in Japan double album. In 2010, AOL Radio listeners voted \"All Those Years Ago\" in sixth place on a list of the \"10 Best George Harrison Songs\". The track has been featured in books such as 1,001 Songs You Must Hear Before You Die, and 10,001 You Must Download by Robert Dimery, and Bruce Pollock's The 7,500 Most Important Songs of 1944\u20132000."@en ;

As in the single release of \"Don't Let's Start\", the version of the song on the \"Hotel Detective\" single is slightly different from the album version. In this case, a drum track fades in to open the song, and Linnell's saxophone is more prominent. Additionally, Peter Pearmain Thomson sings backing vocals, whereas on the album, the backing vocals are sung by John Flansburgh. The entire contents of the EP also appear on the compilation album Miscellaneous T. The track \"Kiss Me, Son of God\" went on to be re-recorded and released on the band's 1988 album, Lincoln. Neither the CD release nor the 12\" release of the EP list the untitled track in their respective track listings.

The first recording of the song to be released was produced by Whitfield on Gladys Knight & the Pips and released as a single in September 1967; it went to number two in the Billboard chart. Smokey Robinson & the Miracles included their version on their 1968 album, Special Occasion. The Marvin Gaye version was placed on his 1968 album In the Groove, where it gained the attention of radio disc jockeys, and Gordy finally agreed to its release as a single in October 1968, when it went to the top of the Billboard Pop Singles chart for seven weeks from December 1968 to January 1969 and became for a time the biggest hit single on the Motown label (Tamla). The Gaye recording has since become an acclaimed soul classic, and in 2004, it was placed on the Rolling Stone list of The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time. On the commemorative 50th Anniversary of the Billboard Hot 100 issue of Billboard magazine in June 2008, Marvin Gaye's \"Grapevine\" was ranked 65th. It was also inducted to the Grammy Hall of Fame for \"historical, artistic and significant\" value. In addition to being released several times by Motown artists, the song has been recorded by a range of musicians including Creedence Clearwater Revival, who made an eleven-minute interpretation for their 1970 album, Cosmo's Factory; and has been used twice in television commercials \u2013 each time using session musicians recreating the style of the Marvin Gaye version: the 1985 Levi's commercial, \"Launderette\", featuring male model Nick Kamen, and the 1986 California raisins promotion with Buddy Miles as the singer for the clay animation group The California Raisins."@en ;

The song was originally announced as being called \"E for England\" but the Football Association vetoed the title, realising that it sounded suspiciously like a reference to the drug ecstasy.

It became one of Gaye's signature 1960s recordings, and was his best-known solo hit before 1968's \"I Heard It Through the Grapevine\"."@en ;

It was written by Clarkson with the song's producers Max Martin and Dr. Luke. The song was released on April 12, 2005 as the second single from the album. Clarkson considered \"Behind These Hazel Eyes\" as one of her favorite songs and she once intended to name Breakaway after the song. \"Behind These Hazel Eyes\" is an uptempo pop rock song that incorporates crunchy guitars which are pulsated with driving beats and anthemic choruses; it narrates Clarkson's broken relationship with her ex-boyfriend. \"Behind These Hazel Eyes\" peaked at number six on the Billboard Hot 100 and stayed inside the top ten in the chart for fifteen weeks. It also became Clarkson's first song to top the Adult Pop Songs chart. It was certified platinum from Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for selling over one million digital downloads. Elsewhere, the song charted in the top ten in Austria, Netherlands, New Zealand and the United Kingdom. The song's accompanying music video was directed by Joseph Kahn and produced by Danyi Deats-Barrett. The concept of the video was conceived by Clarkson and depicts her as a bride who experiences some dream-like hints that her husband-to-be is having an affair with a brunette ceremony attendee. The music video premiered online at MTV and it also received heavy rotation on Total Request Live. The song was performed live by Clarkson at numerous venues, including the Breakaway World Tour (2005) and the All I Ever Wanted Tour (2009)."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"Living Loving Maid (She's Just a Woman)\" is a song by the English rock band Led Zeppelin from their album Led Zeppelin II, released in 1969. It was also released as the b-side of the single \"Whole Lotta Love\". The song is about a groupie who stalked the band early in their career. A misprint by Atlantic Records resulted in in the original UK pressings of Led Zeppelin II being titled \"Livin' Lovin' Wreck (She's a Woman)\", with the \"Wreck\" corrected to \"Maid\" and the subtitle changed on the US and later releases. It is often noted that this is guitarist Jimmy Page's least favourite Led Zeppelin song, and was thus never performed in concert. It was also one of the few Led Zeppelin songs on which Jones sang backing vocals. Conversely, singer Robert Plant took a liking to the song, and played it on his 1990 solo tour promoting his album Manic Nirvana. For the recording of this track, Page played on a Vox 12-string guitar. When heard on the radio it was typically played immediately after their song \"Heartbreaker\", as it flows seamlessly from the abrupt ending of that song on the original album, and thanks to the similarities of subjects involved in the two songs."@en ;

The song, which was written and produced by Max Martin and Lukasz \"Dr. Luke\" Gottwald, was released as the lead single from Breakaway two weeks before the album was released. It is an uptempo pop rock, and power pop song that infuses electronic sound with a mixture of soft and loud alternative rock sound. Martin originally wrote \"Since U Been Gone\" with Pink in mind but she turned it down. It was then given to Hilary Duff but she rejected the song because she could not reach its higher notes. The song was finally given to Clarkson after Clive Davis convinced the writers to give it to her. Clarkson decided to add heavier guitars and harder drums to the song after noticing that the demo had an obvious pop sound. Lyrically, the song is written from a woman's point of view where she expresses her sense of relief with the end of her troubled relationship. \"Since U Been Gone\" received general acclaim from music critics who considered the song to be the highlight of Breakaway. Critics also felt that it was one of the best pop songs in the last decade. Rolling Stone ranked it at number 482 of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time in 2010. \"Since U Been Gone\" was a commercial success. In the United States, the song peaked at number two on the Billboard Hot 100. It topped the US Pop 100 for six consecutive weeks and the US Pop Songs for seven consecutive weeks respectively. It was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for shipments of over one million copies sold. \"Since U Been Gone\" was also a worldwide success, peaking in the top five in Austria, Australia, Ireland, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom. It also peaked in the top ten in Norway, Germany and Switzerland. Clarkson performed \"Since U Been Gone\" at the 2005 MTV Video Music Awards and at the 2006 BRIT Awards.

	dbo:abstract	"\"The Devil Went Down to Georgia\" is a song written and performed by the Charlie Daniels Band and released on their 1979 album Million Mile Reflections. The song is written in the key of D minor. Vassar Clements originally wrote the basic melody an octave lower, in a tune called \"Lonesome Fiddle Blues\" released on Clements' self-titled 1975 album on which Charlie Daniels played guitar. The Charlie Daniels Band moved it up an octave and put words to it. The song's verses are closer to being spoken rather than sung (i.e., recitation), and tell the story of a boy named Johnny, in a variant on the classic deal with the Devil. The performances of Satan and Johnny are played as instrumental bridges. The song was the band's biggest hit, reaching number three on the Billboard Hot 100. It is featured in the 1980 movie Urban Cowboy, whose choreographer, Patsy Swayze, claims that she set the song's tempo. \"How fast can you dance it?\" Daniels asked. \"How fast can you play it?\" Swayze replied."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"What Have You Done for Me Lately\" is a song recorded by American singer-songwriter Janet Jackson for her third studio album, Control (1986). Jackson co-wrote the song with its producers Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis, who produced the track. It was released on January 13, 1986 as the album's lead single by A&M Records. After two unsuccessful albums and a management change, the singer began developing a new album. \"What Have You Done for Me Lately\" was originally penned for one of Jam and Lewis's own records, but the lyrics were rewritten to convey Jackson's feelings about her recent divorce from James DeBarge in January 1985. It revolves around a woman's frustration with her partner in a relationship. Critical reviews for \"What Have You Done for Me Lately\" were positive, with music critics believing it erased the former \"pop-ing\u00E9nue image\" of Jackson's first two albums, reestablishing her as an \"independent woman\" figure. The song has been featured in critic lists as one of the greatest songs of all times and received one nomination for Best Rhythm & Blues Song on the 29th annual Grammy Awards of 1987. The song peaked at number four on the US Billboard Hot 100 and was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). It also peaked at number two on the US Dance Club Songs and topped the US Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs charts. Outside of the US, it topped the singles chart in the Netherlands and peaked within the top ten in Germany, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom. The accompanying music video for \"What Have You Done for Me Lately\" was directed by Brian Jones and Piers Ashworth and choreographed by singer Paula Abdul. In it, Jackson goes to a diner with her friends to talk about her relationship problems. The video won a Soul Train Music Award for Best R&B/Soul or Rap Music Video in 1987. The song was first performed live by Jackson at the 29th annual Grammy Awards in 1987. She has also performed it live in each of her concert tours, beginning with the Rhythm Nation World Tour 1990 through the Unbreakable World Tour (2015-2016). It has been included in each of Jackson's greatest hits albums Design of a Decade: 1986\u20131996 (1995), Number Ones (2009) and Icon: Number Ones (2010). \"What Have You Done for Me Lately\" has been sampled and covered by various artists, and is also regarded as one of Jackson's signature songs which helped establish her as a known artist."@en ;

The song went to number-one on the Billboard Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks chart for one week and number-one on the Hot Modern Rock Tracks for nine weeks. It also peaked at #13 on the Billboard Hot 100, becoming the singer's only solo Top 40 hit on the US pop chart to date. In the United Kingdom, the song reached #34 on the UK Singles Chart. The song went to the Top 5 hitting #4 on the Pop Songs chart. The song was also unexpectedly and surprisingly a hit to adult contemporary stations since most rap songs or songs with rap verses cannot be played on the format. Despite that, the song went to the Top 10 at #9 on the Adult Top 40 chart."@en ;

In Australia, the video premiered on various music video shows such as Rage and Video Hits, but has failed to enter the charts.

dbr:A_World_Without_Love	rdf:type	dbo:MusicalWork ;
	dbo:abstract	"\"A World Without Love\" is a song recorded by the English duo Peter and Gordon and released as their first single in February 1964, reaching number one in the UK Singles Chart in April. The song was written by Paul McCartney and attributed to Lennon\u2013McCartney. The B-side was \"If I Were You\" written by Peter and Gordon. In June 1964, \"A World Without Love\" topped the Billboard Hot 100 in the US. It also reached number one on the Cash Box chart in the US for one week. It was included on the duo's debut album in the UK, and in the US on an album of the same name. It is one of two songs written by Lennon\u2013McCartney to reach number one in the US by an artist other than the Beatles.[citation needed] The other is \"Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds\" covered by Elton John. \"Bad to Me\" written by Lennon in 1963 was given to Billy Kramer and reached number 1 in the UK, but it failed to do so in the US. The song was one of the seven #1s written by Lennon-McCartney that charted in the US in 1964, an all-time songwriting record for most songs to top the US charts in a calendar year. \"A World Without Love\" is one of The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll. A version by the Supremes made the Top 10 in countries in Southeast Asia, including Hong Kong and the Philippines. Del Shannon also performed a cover of this song on his 1964 album Handy Man. A cover version by Bobby Rydell released May 1964 did well enough regionally to reach number 50 on the Billboard Hot 100. In Rydell's native Philadelphia his version reached number 1 in a tandem ranking with the Peter and Gordon version, while in the Pittsburgh market Rydell's version reached number 4 to the exclusion of the Peter and Gordon original. Terry Black released a version of the song on his 1965 debut album, Only 16. McCartney did not think the song was good enough for The Beatles. Before giving the song to Peter and Gordon, he offered it to Billy J. Kramer, who rejected it. It has also been covered by Seattle-based Beatles cover band Apple Jam on their album Off The Beatle Track. McCartney described John Lennon's reaction to the song: \"The funny first line always used to please John. 'Please lock me away \u2013' 'Yes, okay.' End of song.\" Lennon said of the song that \"I think that was resurrected from the past....I think he had that whole song before the Beatles....That has the line 'Please lock me away' that we always used to crack up at.\" McCartney wrote the song when he was 16. When he moved into the London home of his then-girlfriend Jane Asher in 1963, sharing a room with her brother Peter Asher, he offered the song to Asher and Gordon Waller after the pair obtained a recording contract as Peter and Gordon. This song was never released by the Beatles, and the only known recording of the song by any member of the Beatles is the original demo of the song performed by McCartney, which is now in the possession of Peter Asher. As of January 2013, Paul McCartney's demo has been leaked on YouTube. It is 30 seconds in length, but offers a rare glimpse into the song's origins. The clip was played at Asher's most recent string of concerts."@en ;

Alongside \"Hit the Lights\" and \"No Remorse\", \"Jump in the Fire\" is one of Metallica's first original songs, having been included on Ron McGovney's '82 Garage demo, an unreleased recording. The original lyrics and content, which dealt with sex, were written by Dave Mustaine in his former band \"Panic\" at the age of 16. The original version that Mustaine introduced to Hetfield and Ulrich upon joining Metallica was raw. The three worked together on refining the song and the final outcome is what is heard on the demo. However, much like the events surrounding \"The Four Horsemen\", new lyrics were written by James Hetfield upon Mustaine's departure from Metallica. The new lyrics revolve around people being damned to Hell and therefore \"jumping in the fire.\" Lars Ulrich claims that they had written the song to sound like \"Run to the Hills\" by Iron Maiden, which was popular at the time. Current live performances since 2004 are in D standard tuning, as opposed to the E standard tuning of earlier live performances."@en ;

Francis Rossi confirmed on DVD2 of the Pictures set that it was originally intended to be a B-side to \"Gentleman Joe's Sidewalk Cafe\", but it was decided to swap the B-side and the A-side of the single. There are two versions of the song, a stereo and mono version, with significant differences: the mono version, which was the original single, has the trademark psychedelic wah-wah guitar in the breaks between lyrics, but the stereo version omits it. The song opens with a single guitar repeatedly playing a simple four note riff before the bass, rhythm guitar, drums and lyrics begin. \"Pictures of Matchstick Men\" is one of a number of songs from the late sixties to feature the audio effect phasing. Their following release, \"Black Veils of Melancholy\", was similar but flopped, which caused the group to change direction.

The single spent over four months inside the Swedish Top 60 and after six weeks out of the chart the single re-entered at #60 in August 2006; in Germany the single debuted at #34, falling out the top 40 in the next consecutive weeks, but re-entering at #30; since then, the single has spent two months inside the Top 30, peaking at #19. The single has been released throughout Europe; a South and North American release was expected for late 2006, but it seems that the plans were scrapped and nothing has been announced about a release date for other markets.

Courtney Love wrote the song in the fall of 1991 soon after she met Kurt Cobain, and has admitted that its lyrics were about her insecurity of his romantic interest in her. It went on to become one of the band's most popular songs, peaking on the US Billboard Modern Rock Tracks at number 4, and is considered by fans and critics alike as one of Hole's signature tracks."@en ;

The single was released with three B-sides written by Saint Etienne's songwriting partnership of Bob Stanley and Pete Wiggs: \"I Buy American Records\", \"Hate Your Drug\" and \"La Poupee Qui Fait Non (No, No, No)\". The latter was produced by the band's friend (and future Heavenly label mate) Edwyn Collins. A second CD featured remixes by Motiv8, Secret Knowledge, Juan \"Kinky\" Hernandez and Sure is Pure. It reached #32 in the UK charts. This would be Saint Etienne's final release for Warner Bros. Follow up single \"He's on the Phone\" would be released on MCA Records, lifted from a dance compilation album called Life is a Dance. The US releases included a number of exclusive remixes - including an alternate album version (which was released as a bonus track on the US version of Tiger Bay), a Motiv-8 dub, and the On Tour In '94 dub. The song bears a resemblance to the 70s disco hit More, More, More by Andrea True Connection. In particular, the phrasing of the \"More More More\" lyric \"Ooh, how do you like your love?\" is identical to the \"Hug My Soul\" lyric \"Ooh, what are you dreaming of?\", and both lyrics are the opening to each of their representative songs."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"I'm From Further North Than You\" is a song by The Wedding Present. It was released as the second single from the album Take Fountain. The single was released on January 31, 2005 on CD and 7\" vinyl. This was the only single from the album to be released on two formats. A music video was produced for the song, featuring David Gedge and a woman (played by actress Annie Bergin) talking on their cell phones, in partially animated, comic book style. Their comments are displayed throughout the video, seemingly directed at one another, until the end of the video when the two bump into each other as complete strangers, and Gedge asks her out for coffee. The video can be found on the bonus DVD from the compilation album Search for Paradise: Singles 2004-5, released in 2006. The single peaked at number 34 in the UK singles chart. This was their first top 40 hit for 8 years and the last so far in their career."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"Lying Is the Most Fun a Girl Can Have Without Taking Her Clothes Off\", often shortened to \"Lying Is the Most Fun...\", is a single by the alternative rock band Panic! at the Disco, from the album A Fever You Can't Sweat Out. Released on August 7, 2006, it is the third commercially released single from that album and fourth overall (\"The Only Difference Between Martyrdom and Suicide Is Press Coverage\" was only released promotionally). The song is sometimes referred to by the shortened title \"Lying Is the Most Fun\" for radio.[citation needed] The song's title was taken from a line of dialog in the 2004 film Closer (based on a 1997 play of the same name). The line, spoken by Natalie Portman's character, Alice, is \"Lying is the most fun a girl can have without taking her clothes off, but it's better if you do.\" \"But It's Better If You Do\", another song by Panic at the Disco, was released as a single prior to \"Lying is the Most Fun\". In the United States, the song peaked at number 28 on the Billboard Alternative Songs chart, number 96 on the Pop 100, and number 4 on the Bubbling Under Hot 100 Singles chart. The song also reached number 39 on the UK Singles Chart, in the process becoming the longest un-bracketed title of a song to enter the UK Top 40 and number 26 on the ARIA Charts. The song also number 33 in New Zealand. This song was included in the video game Saints Row 2. The single cover for this song is the only of Panic!'s material to bear a Parental advisory label."@en ;

In an interview with The Mail On Sunday in 2008, Richard said of the song: \"This is a real hidden gem in many ways because, although it reached No1 in Britain, it wasn't even released in America. At that time, The Beatles were taking off in the States and anyone who had a No. 1 here was guaranteed a top five there, including The Bachelors, who weren't rock artists as such but had a huge hit. I thought it was my big chance but the US record company said it wasn't right for their market. Hello? What wasn\u2019t right? It was No. 1 in many countries.\" The song was written by Jimmy Gately, a Nashville, Tennessee based fiddle player and singer.

One of the last songs to be recorded for the album, \"All the Lovers\" was written by Jim Eliot and Mima Stilwell and produced by the former. Stuart Price, the executive producer of Aphrodite, was responsible for additional production and mixing of the song. Minogue felt \"All the Lovers\" summarised the \"euphoria\" of the album perfectly and chose it to be the lead single from Aphrodite. It was then globally released by Parlophone as a CD single and digital download on 11 June 2010. \"All the Lovers\" is a midtempo disco song with influences of electropop music. The lyrics of the song serve as an invitation to the dance floor and an assertion that Minogue's past relationships do not \"compare\" to the one she shares with her present lover. Upon its release, \"All the Lovers\" garnered critical acclaim and was commended for its chorus and production. Many critics found it similar to Minogue's 2004 single \"I Believe in You\". Compared to the lead singles from Minogue's previous albums, \"All the Lovers\" underperformed in Australia and missed peaking inside the top ten of the Australian Singles Chart. However, it was a commercial success in Europe, reaching the top ten in numerous countries including Austria, Belgium, France, Italy, Spain and Switzerland and the United Kingdom. In the latter country, \"All the Lovers\" peaked at number three on the UK Singles Chart. A club hit in the United States, it topped the Billboard Hot Dance Club Songs chart. \"All the Lovers\" was certified silver in the United Kingdom and gold in Australia and Italy. An accompanying music video for \"All the Lovers\" was filmed in Downtown Los Angeles by Joseph Kahn, and features Minogue singing the song from atop a pyramid of underwear-clad couples. Critical reception towards the video was favourable, with many critics enjoying its concept and imagery. The music video was banned in several Asian countries due to its sexual nature. For additional promotion, Minogue performed the song on various television shows, such as Germany's Next Topmodel and Alan Carr: Chatty Man. It was included on the set list of the Aphrodite: Les Folies Tour and was performed during the encore segment of the concert shows. An orchestral version of the song was featured on the tracklist of Minogue's 2012 compilation album The Abbey Road Sessions."@en ;

In July 2011 the song was sampled again for Travis Garland and JoJo\u2019s duet \u201CPaint\u201D, and New York singer/songwriter Niia uploaded a cover version of \u201CBTSTU\u201D to her SoundCloud page. The single received favourable reviews. Lucy Jones of The Daily Telegraph professed her admiration for Paul\u2019s vocal and production by writing; \u201CGentle, angelic falsettos sing curses and threaten warnings while a sparkling dub-bass jolts and plays tug of war with electro-soul synths. Paul brings in different elements of his orchestra, the saxophone, alto voices and ploppy drums to support and boy, it works\u201D. These sentiments were echoed in the US with American blog The Wounded Jukebox writing that \u201CPaul fits 10 tons of pop and funk into a three and a half minute lambasting. There\u2019s a deceptive sensitivity within the words, but it\u2019s betrayed and assimilated quickly by a sinister kind of undercurrent\u201D. Ryan Dombal of Pitchfork observed Paul\u2019s style of meshing pop music with underground sensibilities by stating that \u201CBTSTU\u201D is \u201Can off-kilter pop tune that's automatically raw, bright, new. The palm-slap beat is a little dirty and drunk as it recalls the unmistakable lope of one J Dilla\u201D. A number of publications included \u201CBTSTU\u201D in their end-of-year lists in 2011 including Pitchfork, The Fader, and Pigeons and Planes. The Washington Post mentioned \u201CBTSTU\u201D in their \u2018Singles File: Best of 2011\u2019 describing it as \u201Ca precursor to the entire career of James Blake\u201D."@en ;

On its creation, Jagger said in 1994, \"'I Go Wild', I suppose, is the one I play (guitar) on most. I mean, I just created it on guitar with Charlie [Watts], as a groove. And we more or less had the whole song down before we took it to anyone else.\" On the song overall, Jagger said, \" I like that song. I really got into the lyrics on that one. One of the wordy ones.\" A straight forward rock song, \"I Go Wild\"'s lyrics tell of the singer's relationship with an unnamed \"femme fatale\"; \"I Go Wild\" was recorded between the months of July and August and November and December 1993 at Sandymount Studios, Ireland and A&M Recording Studios, Los Angeles. With Jagger on lead vocals, Richards and Ron Wood accompany him on electric guitars. Charlie Watts performs drums while Darryl Jones performs bass. Chuck Leavell performs the song's organ while Phil Jones incorporate percussion. Jagger, Richards, Bernard Fowler, and Ivan Neville perform backing vocals. \"I Go Wild\" was released as the fourth single from Voodoo Lounge on July 3, 1995. It reached number 29 on the UK singles chart. A video was shot at Ex-templo de San L\u00E1zaro in Mexico City right before the Stones' fourteen stadium tour of South America. The song performed throughout the 1994-1995 Voodoo Lounge Tour, but has yet to be included on any live albums or compilations; however, a live version was one of the b-sides to the song's maxi-single."@en ;

Taken from her third studio album Here I Am (2011), the contemporary R&B song was written by Sean and Ester Dean while Hit-Boy co-wrote and produced the song with a piano-driven melody. Laced with elements of 808s and high NRG beats, \"Lay It on Me\" tells the story of Rowland describing sexual encounters with her lover. The song was served to US rhythmic radio on August 16, 2011 by Universal Motown as the album's second single, and later in 2012 as the album's fourth international single. It was met by a warm response from critics, who generally praised the sex appeal of the song, progressive production and suggestive lyrics. \"Lay It On Me\" has peaked in the top-fifty of the US Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart. In the UK, Lay It On Me failed to match the success of its predecessor 'Down For Whatever' which became a top-ten hit. This was due to a lack of promotion and airplay. The accompanying music video features interactions with Sean, as well as scenes including Rowland stroking an elephant and dancing with a troupe of black dancers against a white backdrop. It was shot back-to-back with the video for Rowland's third international single, \"Down for Whatever\", with director Sarah Chatfield and choreographer Frank Gatson, Jr."@en ;

Vinton adapted his song from a German song composed by Henry Mayer, and it appears on Vinton's album Melodies of Love. Vinton came up with the idea to adapt Mayer's song while performing in Las Vegas, Nevada. The original song was called Herzen haben keine Fenster (\"Hearts have no windows\") and was a hit in Germany and Austria as performed by Austrian singer Elfi Graf. A version with newly written English lyrics, released as a single called \"Don't Stay Away Too Long\" by the British duo Peters and Lee earlier in 1974, failed to chart in the US but reached number three on the UK Singles Chart. Vinton's lyrics use a refrain that switches between English and Polish: \"My Melody of Love\" was Vinton's highest charting US pop hit since \"Mr. Lonely\" reached number one on the Billboard Hot 100 chart in 1964, nearly ten years before. The RIAA-certified gold single spent two weeks at number three on the Hot 100 chart in November 1974 and one week at number one on the Billboard easy listening chart, the singer's fourth song to top this chart. Its success led to Vinton's nickname \"the Polish Prince\". The song also became the theme-song of The Bobby Vinton Show, Vinton's variety show which ran in Canada on the CTV Network from 1975 to 1978. The song was also performed numerous times on the Lawrence Welk Show during the mid- to late-1970s."@en ;

It features claviola, horn, organ and piano instrumentation. The song garnered positive reviews from music critics, many of whom cited it as a standout track on Back to Basics. Critics also praised its blend of old and modern R&B influences, as well as Aguilera's vocal performance. The single was only released in Australia during the Oceanian leg of Aguilera's Back to Basics Tour (2007). \"Slow Down Baby\" peaked at number 21 on the Australian Singles Chart, although it did not receive any promotion in that country."@en ;

After being played by Damon Albarn and Graham Coxon at Brixton Academy as part of a charity performance for War Child, speculation rose as to \"Under the Westway\"'s release. On 25 June 2012, it was announced on Blur's Twitter account that the track would be performed live by the band via a live stream and released for download shortly after, with Albarn stating \"I wrote these songs for [the upcoming Hyde Park show] and I\u2019m really excited about getting out there and playing them for people.\" The single was released as a download-only release on 2 July 2012, accompanied by \"The Puritan\", and received a physical release in August. The song also made its radio debut on Steve Lamacq's BBC Radio 6 Music show on the same day. It is the band's first single since 2010's \"Fool's Day\". An early mix of the song is included on the Blur 21 box set. The performances of \"Under the Westway\" and \"The Puritan\" on 2 July are the first live performances of new material by the whole band since 30 January 1999, when all four members played a fan-club only concert at Finchley Arts Depot, London.[citation needed] That was at the start of the 13 tour, in which all songs from that album bar two were premiered. \"Under the Westway\" debuted at #34 on the UK Singles Chart on download sales alone. Discounting limited releases which did not chart, \"Under the Westway\" was Blur's lowest peak placement since their debut single, \"She's So High\". The low positioning was likely aided by a lack of significant publicity and corresponding album release. \"Under the Westway\" also reached #54 in the Ireland Singles Chart. When the song was eventually released in a physical format in August, bounced back up the charts from #117 to #45. It was also a hit in the French Charts at #120."@en ;

Another is a rapper who offends his fans because he thinks he is above them but they turn on him - he is left unemployed with no one because he has offended them all. Another is a drug addict, paranoid and doesn't eat. He rips off his family for drug money and they disown him. He then tries to do an armed robbery to get money but accidentally kills someone and ends up on death row.

	dbo:abstract	"\"First of the Gang to Die\" is a song written by Morrissey from his 2004 album You Are the Quarry. It was released in July 2004 as the second single from the album. It was written by Morrissey along with Alain Whyte, the two being responsible for lyrics and music respectively. Following the success of \"Irish Blood, English Heart\", from the same album, the single reached the number six spot in the UK Singles Chart, giving Morrissey two top hits in a row for the first time since \"The Last of the Famous International Playboys\" and \"Interesting Drug\" both reached the top ten in 1989. The single was A-Listed by BBC Radio 2 and received much more exposure than \"Irish Blood, English Heart\", propelling it onto the top 40 airplay chart. It entered the official singles chart at number six, making it the third-highest charting song and most successful follow-up single of Morrissey's career. The single stayed in the chart for seven weeks, longer than any other Morrissey single. In the United States, the single failed to quickly achieve widespread airplay success like \"Irish Blood, English Heart\". However, it debuted at number 12 on the Billboard Hot 100 Singles Sales chart on 31 July, causing \"Irish Blood, English Heart\" to re-enter the chart for a week. By September, it had been added to the playlists of a few stations that supported the last single, including WNNX (Atlanta), CD101 (Columbus), KROQ, WHTG-FM (Monmouth / Ocean), KMBY, WROX-FM (Norfolk), XTRA, and KITS (San Francisco). However, despite at one point being nearly in the 50 most played alternative rock songs in the United States, \"First of the Gang to Die\" was never played in enough markets to break into the Top 40 portion of the Hot Modern Rock Tracks chart. In October 2011, NME placed it at number 147 on its list \"150 Best Tracks of the Past 15 Years\". The single was covered by Malaysian singer-songwriter, indie pop artist Zee Avi on her 2009 self-titled debut album."@en ;

Written by Hill for Franklin, the song is feminist-based, focused on a motherly figure giving advice to a younger woman who keeps getting into bad relationships. Throughout the song, Franklin advises that in spite of everything and despite the woman's \"scorned roses and thorn crowns\" that the woman is \"still a rose\". Elements of the song \"What I Am\" by Edie Brickell and the New Bohemians were sung throughout the song by Hill herself. The video features Franklin, Hill and other female R&B singers such as Faith Evans, Changing Faces, and Amel Larrieux and featured Elise Neal in the video as the protagonist. Released in 1998, the song became a surprise hit for Franklin, 40-plus years into her career, reaching number twenty-six on the Billboard Hot 100 and number-five on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart while also reaching the UK top forty.

ns24:Freebird_Medley	rdf:type	dbo:MusicalWork ;
	dbo:abstract	"\"Baby, I Love Your Way/Freebird Medley (Free Baby)\" is a song by the American dance-pop band Will to Power. The song combines elements of two previously recorded rock songs: \"Baby, I Love Your Way\", a #12 Billboard Hot 100 hit from 1976 by the British-born singer Peter Frampton; and American Southern rock band Lynyrd Skynyrd's song \"Free Bird\", which hit #19 on the Hot 100 chart in 1975. Will to Power's medley of these two songs had more of a synthesized dance beat (as opposed to the rock ballad-like nature of the two original songs). It spent one week at #1 on the Hot 100 chart dated December 3, 1988. It also peaked at #2 on the Billboard adult contemporary chart. Additionally, in the \"Freebird\" section, the line \"and the bird you cannot change\" in the original version was changed to \"and this bird will never change\". In March and April 2009, VH1 ran a countdown of the 100 Greatest One Hit Wonders of the 80s. Will to Power's \"Baby, I Love Your Way/Freebird Medley\" placed at #97 on the countdown despite the fact the group having another Top 10 hit in 1991 with a cover version of the 1975 10cc hit \"I'm Not in Love.\""@en ;

It first appeared on his 1983 album Silver, which marked his 25th anniversary in music. In May 1984 (and only in the UK), it became the fourth song to be lifted from the album as a single after starting out as the mere B-side of the third single \"Baby You're Dynamite\", released in March 1984. Although having only minor chart success, the song quickly became a phenomenon among Richard's fans the world over, with fans voting the song as their favourite, 25 times out of 26 between 1984 and 2009 in the annual \"Cliff Poll\" of the fan's favourite songs (where the final poll was in 2009). In the UK, it also has made its way into public polls conducted by radio stations of their favourite Cliff Richard songs. The song broke through to the wider public in South East Asia, becoming very popular in the Philippines where it became one of the bigger hits of the 1980s, and Hong Kong."@en ;

Perry co-wrote the song with its producers, StarGate and Sandy Vee, with additional writing from Ester Dean. It is a dance-pop and dance-rock self-empowerment anthem with inspirational lyrics, and was considered by Perry as an important song for her on Teenage Dream. The song was released on October 18, 2010 by Capitol Records as the third single from the album. \"Firework\" received mostly positive reviews from music critics, with some noting its catchy melody and danceable beat and comparing it to songs by British band Coldplay. The song was commercially successful, reaching number 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 and the top five on 20 charts around the world. As of October 2015, the song has sold 7 million copies in the US alone. An accompanying music video, directed by Dave Meyers, was released on October 28, 2010. It portrays Perry singing and dancing around Budapest, with interspersed scenes of young people becoming confident in themselves. An open casting call for the music video drew an unprecedented 38,000 applicants. On MuchMusic's top 50 videos of 2010, \"Firework\" reached the top position. The music video was said to be a more upbeat take on Christina Aguilera's message in \"Beautiful\". It was nominated for three awards at the 2011 MTV Video Music Awards, eventually winning one of those, the Video of the Year, the main and final award. \"Firework\" was nominated for Record of the Year and Best Pop Solo Performance at the 54th Grammy Awards.

	dbo:abstract	"\"Turnin Me On\" is a song by American singer-songwriter Keri Hilson, taken from her debut album, In a Perfect World.... The song features American rapper Lil Wayne who co-wrote the song alongside Hilson and Zachary Anson Wallace. Production credits are shared between Danja and Polow da Don, who also co-wrote the song. Following the minimal chart success of Hilson's worldwide lead single \"Energy\" in the United States, international markets received \"Return the Favor\", while \"Turnin Me On\" was released as the third single in the US. After experimenting with more pop-oriented music in her previous mentioned songs, Hilson opted for a more urban, hip-hop flavored sound for the song, due her to wanting to keep to her roots. While noting her less than stellar vocals on the track, critics praised Hilson's sassiness and attitude on the track and complimented Lil Wayne's verse, which has been called the best surprise rap since Lisa \"Left Eye\" Lopes on TLC's \"Waterfalls.\" The song's accompanying music video features intricate Aaliyah and \"Soldier\"-esque choreography, dance scenes such as the Bird Walk, and Hilson being flaunted by men. The scenes are intercut with mirror scenes with younger kids. The song was a commercial success in the United States, reaching number fifteen on the Billboard Hot 100, whilst reaching two on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart. \"Turnin Me On\" received two nominations at the 2009 BET Awards, and a \"Song of the Year\" nomination at the 2009 Soul Train Music Awards. A leaked remix of the song caused controversy, with rumors that Hilson was taking shots at fellow female R&B singers Beyonc\u00E9 Knowles and Ciara, however Hilson has fervently denied the rumors that it was a diss. Hilson performed the song as a part of a medley at the 2009 Soul Train Music Awards and BET Awards."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"DJ Culture\" is the first single released by British electronic music group Pet Shop Boys from their singles collection album Discography: The Complete Singles Collection. The single peaked at #13 on the UK Singles Chart in 1991. Another version of the song, remixed by The Grid and entitled \"Dj culturemix\" was also released as a single and entered the UK charts at #40. The B-side was \"Music For Boys\" According to the singer Neil Tennant, the song concerned the insincerity of how President George H. W. Bush's speeches at the time of the First Gulf War utilised Winston Churchill's wartime rhetoric, in a manner similar to how artists sample music from other artists. The video clip alternately features Neil Tennant and Chris Lowe as a pair of doctors, a pair of soldiers in desert combat dress, a judge presiding over Oscar Wilde (the line \"And I my lord, may I say nothing?\" is a close paraphrase of Wilde's comment after being sentenced to hard labour for homosexual practices) and a football referee and fan. The French sample in the song is taken from the 1950 Jean Cocteau movie Orph\u00E9e: in it coded and poetic messages are sent over the radio."@en .

After a couple of years of unsuccessful singles, the Supremes had finally broken through with a Top 40 single (23) in December 1963 with \"When the Lovelight Starts Shining Through His Eyes\". On the throes of its release, Motown rush-released a second HDH single titled \"Run, Run, Run\". Inspired by the sounds by Phil Spector, it was an attempt to give the Supremes a poppier sound to their earlier heavy R&B recordings. The single proved to be unsuccessful, as it peaked at number 93 on the Billboard Hot 100 and number 22 on the Cash Box R&B chart. The Supremes would eventually escape the shadow of their so-called \"no-hit\" past with \"Where Did Our Love Go\"."@en ;

The song was released as the fourth and final single from the album only in some European countries and in Brazil during June 2008. The song was written by Lavigne and Butch Walker, and was produced by Walker. The song is a pop punk track about female self-confidence, containing a spell out of her name, in the style of an American football cheer, with each letter spelling out a different way in which a girlfriend deserves to be treated. The song received mixed reviews from music critics, some citing its similarities to Toni Basil's song \"Mickey\", and comparing it to her previous single \"Girlfriend\". Commercially, the song failed to make any significant impact on the charts, peaking outside the top-forty in most countries. However, it achieved platinum status in Brazil, for selling over 100,000 copies. A music video for the song was directed by Wayne Isham, featuring Lavigne as the leader of a cheerleading group, wearing a pink wig whilst playing an electric guitar, and with her band.

Rolling Stone magazine's Ken Barnes praised the single's \"upbeat\" and \"economical\" sound in a 1974 review, claiming Bolan's new output to be \"fresh and attractive\". The single was in the UK charts for a total of five weeks, peaking at No. 22, and is notable as being the first T. Rex single to miss the Top 20. It appeared as the closing track on the end credits for the Vince Vaughn film, Delivery Man (2013)."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"Groovy Times\" is a song by The Clash, featured on their The Cost of Living EP, and released as a promotional single in 1979 in Australia by Epic Records (AE7 1178). It was originally recorded as \"Groovy Times Are Here Again\" during the recording sessions for Give 'Em Enough Rope, however this demo has never been officially released, but can be found on many Clash bootlegs. It was never performed live. The song's lyrics are filled with images of urban decay and civil unrest and focus on recurring Clash themes of alienation, monotony and oppression. According to their author, Joe Strummer, the lyrics were sparked by his disgust at the erection of fences in Britain's football terraces, built to keep fans apart in response to football hooliganism. Ten years later the Hillsborough Disaster would prove these fences fatal and his concerns irrefutably correct. The 'King of Early Evening ITV' mentioned in the song is confirmed as Bill Grundy, whose career was ruined after his infamous interview with the Sex Pistols and was indeed presenting early evening television on British terrestrial channel ITV. 'I can remember his first appearance now look what's happened to him, so they put him in a dog suit like from 1964' is about singer-songwriter Elvis Costello. The music, acoustic and guitar based, was predominantly written by Mick Jones and feature harmonica parts by him but credited to 'Bob Jones', a pseudonym that was apparently a reference to singer/songwriter Bob Dylan. \"Groovy Times\" has subsequently been re-released on the Clash on Broadway and Singles Box box sets, its single-disc equivalent The Singles and the Super Black Market Clash and The Essential Clash compilations."@en ;

Its two B-sides were recorded for John Peel's Radio 1 show in May 1999. Neither song featured on Sounds from the Gulf Stream and so were exclusive to this release.

A music video was made for the song. \"Parallel Horizontal\" garnered several positive reviews. Paul Connolly in The Times described it as \"Perfect sunny day pop music\", while Dale Kattack in Nightshift wrote: \"it's fantastically merry and uncomplicated but for all its sweetness there's barely a trace of tweeness to he heard\".

	dbo:abstract	"\"Rose Colored Glasses\" is a song by American recording artist Kelly Rowland, recorded for her third studio album, Here I Am (2011). It was written by Ester Dean and Lukasz \"Dr. Luke\" Gottwald, with lyrics reflecting the different perspectives on relationships and how one can perceive a relationship different from the outside. It opens with an electro-crescendo followed with vocals by Rowland while Emily Wright produced Rowland's vocals; the production is based upon layered synths and drums, programmed by Dr. Luke. Dean helped Rowland to record the song, which Rowland said made her cry as it reminded her of her own experiences in past relationships. \"Rose Colored Glasses\" also had an effect on Rowland's vocals, causing them to swell. The song was serviced to rhythmic and contemporary hit radio on June 29, 2010. Critics praised \"Rose Colored Glasses\" as one of Rowland's strongest vocal and emotional performances to date. The arrangement and delivery were praised as being classy, while the critics felt that the overall emotion of the song gave Rowland the best chance of achieving US chart success. \"Rose Colored Glasses\" was released on June 28, 2010 across some parts of Europe, and a day later in the United States and Canada, where it was intended to be one of the album's two lead singles. An accompanying 3-D concept music video, directed by John \"Rankin\" Wadell was released, featuring atmospheric visuals and mood-lit scenes including streamers, doves, and rose petals. Reception for the video was positive, praising its simplicity and noting the stunning visuals and variety of outfits worn by Rowland. The single had limited chart success, entering the top-forty radio airplay charts in Slovakia and the United States, but failed to appear on the US Billboard Hot 100. It is excluded from the US track listing for Here I Am."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"A Lovely Day Tomorrow\" was a one-off single from British Sea Power, only released to shops in the Czech Republic but available at certain shows and via mail order in the United Kingdom. It is a re-recording of an early B-side by the band (from the \"Remember Me\" single). The B-side \"Z\u00EDtra Bude Kr\u00E1sn\u00FD Den\" is a version of the song translated into Czech. Both versions of the song feature lead vocals by Kate\u0159ina Winterov\u00E1 of Ecstasy of Saint Theresa. Whilst the original plan had been to teach original vocalist, Hamilton, the Czech lyrics it was thought to be easier to recruit someone else. The song deals with the assassination of Reinhard Heydrich by two Czechoslovak agents during World War II. To celebrate the entry of Czech Republic into the European Union it was decided to put out this release as a limited edition of 1,942 copies (the year the operation took place). The two bands also played special shows at Prague's club Roxy and London's Cargo club, and BSP gained a sponsorship deal with Budvar beer. \"Fakir\" is not a traditional Czech song - it is rather unknown to Czech listeners. It was written and performed in the 1940s by the Czech hitmakers of the swing era - R.A. Dvorsky and his Melody Boys. The song was recommended to BSP by Jan P. Muchow, the guitarist of Ecstasy of Saint Theresa."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"Breakaway\" is a song recorded by American pop-rock singer Kelly Clarkson. The song, written by Matthew Gerrard, Bridget Benenate and Avril Lavigne, was originally intended for Lavigne's debut studio album, Let Go (2002). After being deemed unsuitable for the album, it was passed to Clarkson to be recorded as a soundtrack for the film The Princess Diaries 2: Royal Engagement. Clarkson, who was finishing her second studio album at that time, recorded \"Breakaway\" to tide her fans over until the first single from her new album was released. However, the song's success prompted its inclusion on Clarkson's second album where she decided to name the album after the song. \"Breakaway\" was first released by Walt Disney Records as the first single from The Princess Diaries 2 soundtrack on July 19, 2004. In May 2006, Breakaway was reissued as the fifth and final single from the album of the same name. \"Breakaway\" was well received by music critics, who complimented the song's universal message and its simple lyrics where people could relate to. It incorporates acoustic guitars and airy drums which are interspersed with Clarkson's controlled voice. The lyrics narrate Clarkson's journey as a girl growing up in a small town who follows her dream for self-improvement. \"Breakaway\" was a commercial success outside of the United States, where it peaked within the top 20 of multiple European countries, and in the top 10 in Australia, Belgium, Hungary and the Netherlands. In the US, the song peaked at number six on the Billboard Hot 100 chart and became her third top ten song in the chart. It also topped the US Adult Contemporary for twenty-one non-consecutive weeks, a record that is now shared between herself and Celine Dion's \"A New Day Has Come\". Directed by Dave Meyers, the accompanying music video for \"Breakaway\" portrays Clarkson as a young girl from a small town who follows her dream and becomes an international star. It also contained scenes interspersed from The Princess Diaries 2: Royal Engagement. Clarkson acted out most of the lyrics in the music video because she felt that the song was autobiographical. Critics responded positively to the music video for being faithful to the central theme shared by the song, the film, and Clarkson's personal biography. Clarkson performed the song in a series of live appearances such as television shows Saturday Night Live, The Oprah Winfrey Show and The Tonight Show with Jay Leno. She has performed the song in her concert tours, including the Stronger Tour. \"Breakaway\" has also been covered by many contestants from reality television singing competitions, notably Katie Stevens, a contestant in the ninth season of American Idol, as well as an English pop duo, Belle Amie who finished eleventh in the seventh season of The X Factor. It was also used in Brazilian soap opera Malha\u00E7\u00E3o."@en ;

The song was written by Hamasaki herself while it was produced by Dutch disc jockey Ferry Corsten. The song was first conceived when Corsten had developed a track in Europe entitled \"The Lost of Love\". Despite him playing it at several events and shows throughout Europe, he did not release the track. After this, Hamasaki and Corsten had started to collaborate and the pair had changed and used the finishing result to create \"Connected\". Musically, \"Connected\" is a trance song that utilizes electro and dance music, which was a prominent musical genre during early 2000s. The song achieved favorable reception from most music critics, who had praised the musical collaboration and electronic influence within the album. However, some critics were divided by the lack of progression and Hamasaki's vocal abilities. Being released in Europe in April 2003 as her first European single, the song did not chart in any important record charts neither did it chart on Oricon. An accompanying music video was shot for the single by Kouji Morimoto and featured anime inspired themes and features people in a futuristic city.

The song is the album's only ballad, featuring a treated drum machine, as well as live drums. Keyboards and bass make up the remaining instrumentation with an understated guitar. As the title would imply, the song is about a gigolo who craves real love rather than meaningless sex. As the song fades out, there appears to be a spoken (one-sided) conversation, but as there was no extended version released, the full context is unknown. The single was backed with the album's closing track \"I Don't Wanna Leave You\". Despite the single only reaching #77 on the R&B charts and not touching the pop charts, the track became a favorite amongst fans of The Time and \"Gigolos Get Lonely Too\" is played at nearly all of their concerts.[citation needed] A live recording from 1998 was also included on Morris Day's 2004 release, It's About Time."@en ;

The band decided they would release the song as a promotional single after each member found that there was something \"special\" about the song. The single had \"phenomenal success\", and its music video was requested more than any other video on MTV's TRL, making it the first officially \"retired\" music video. \"Got the Life\" did not receive much attention in the music press; however, the song was rewarded a gold certification in Australia by the Australian Recording Industry Association. It peaked at number one on the Canadian RPM Rock/Alternative Chart chart, as well as number fifteen on the US Billboard Mainstream Rock Tracks chart and number seventeen on the US Billboard Modern Rock Tracks chart."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"He's on the Phone\" is a song by British pop group Saint Etienne in collaboration with French singer-songwriter \u00C9tienne Daho. A fast-paced dance track, it is one of Saint Etienne's biggest hits, reaching #11 on the UK Singles Chart. The lyrics tell of an \"academia girl\" trying to escape from a relationship with a married man: \"He's on the phone / And she wants to go home, / Shoes in hand, / Don't make a sound, / It's time to go.\" At the centre of the track is a spoken-word section by Daho. The song is a remix by Motiv8 of \"Accident\", which appeared on the Saint Etienne/\u00C9tienne Daho Reserection EP, released a few months previously in June, 1995. \"Accident\" itself is a rewritten version of Daho's 1984 French-language hit single \"Weekend \u00E0 Rome\", with original English lyrics. Daho's spoken-word vocals are from the Reserection opening track, \"Reserection\". The single was credited to \"Saint Etienne featuring \u00C9tienne Daho\". Daho also appears in the song's music video and joined the band in their performance of the song on Top of the Pops. Daho would also go on to perform the original \"Weekend \u00E0 Rome\" lyrics with the instrumentation from \"He's on the Phone\" in a performance on the French edition of Star Academy. Spanish pop singer Princessa covered the song on her 1996 album Calling You."@en ;

Built around a soul\u2013influenced production sampling the Frankie Beverly and Maze song \"I Need You\", \"Hustler's Ambition\" features lyrics regarding 50 Cent's rise to fortune and fame, intended to mirror the experience faced by 50 Cent's character in the film: it marks a shift from influence of hardcore hip hop present in 50 Cent's earlier work. \"Hustler's Ambition\" was released to digital retailers in the United States in October 2005 via Interscope Records, with a CD release following in February 2006. The song received generally favorable reviews from music critics, many of whom complimented the soulful production and 50 Cent's delivery. Some also found the song to be more musically diverse than the music 50 Cent recorded at the beginning of his career. The song achieved commercial success on a number of music charts, reaching the top 25 of charts across Europe and Australasia, although it only reached number 65 on the US Billboard Hot 100, making it one of 50 Cent's least successful songs in the country. A music video for \"Hustler's Ambition\" was directed by Anthony Mandler, and shows 50 Cent performing the song inside a warehouse whilst preparing for a boxing match."@en ;

Simpson performed \"La La\" multiple times on television in 2004. On January 4, 2005, Simpson performed the song live at the halftime show of the Orange Bowl football game in Miami, Florida. She sang off-key, and after singing the last line, the stadium audience booed her. Critics compared this poor performance to Simpson's revealing miscue on Saturday Night Live October 23, 2004, in which she had intended to perform \"Autobiography\" but the earlier recording of \"Pieces of Me\" was heard instead, showing that Simpson had been lip-syncing. Simpson explained the poor performance of \"La La\" was the result of an equipment failure, with her in-ear monitors not working."@en ;

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Scarborough_Fair_(ballad)>	rdf:type	dbo:MusicalWork ;
	dbo:abstract	"\"Scarborough Fair\" is a traditional English ballad about the Yorkshire town of Scarborough. The song relates the tale of a young man who instructs the listener to tell his former love to perform for him a series of impossible tasks, such as making him a shirt without a seam and then washing it in a dry well, adding that if she completes these tasks he will take her back. Often the song is sung as a duet, with the woman then giving her lover a series of equally impossible tasks, promising to give him his seamless shirt once he has finished. As the versions of the ballad known under the title \"Scarborough Fair\" are usually limited to the exchange of these impossible tasks, many suggestions concerning the plot have been proposed, including the hypothesis that it is about the Great Plague of the late Middle Ages. The lyrics of \"Scarborough Fair\" appear to have something in common with an obscure Scottish ballad, The Elfin Knight (Child Ballad #2), which has been traced at least as far back as 1670 and may well be earlier. In this ballad, an elf threatens to abduct a young woman to be his lover unless she can perform an impossible task (\"For thou must shape a sark to me / Without any cut or heme, quoth he\"); she responds with a list of tasks that he must first perform (\"I have an aiker of good ley-land / Which lyeth low by yon sea-strand\"). The melody is very typical of the middle English period. As the song spread, it was adapted, modified, and rewritten to the point that dozens of versions existed by the end of the 18th century, although only a few are typically sung nowadays. The references to the traditional English fair, \"Scarborough Fair\" and the refrain \"parsley, sage, rosemary, and thyme\" date to 19th century versions, and the refrain may have been borrowed from the ballad Riddles Wisely Expounded, (Child Ballad #1), which has a similar plot. A number of older versions refer to locations other than Scarborough Fair, including Wittingham Fair, Cape Ann, \"twixt Berwik and Lyne\", etc. Many versions do not mention a place-name, and are often generically titled (\"The Lovers' Tasks\", \"My Father Gave Me an Acre of Land\", etc.)."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"Take Me to Church\" is a song by Irish musician Hozier for his debut extended play (EP) Take Me to Church (2013), as well as his self-titled debut album (2014). The song was released as his debut single on 13 September 2013. Hozier, a struggling musician at the time of its writing, wrote and recorded the song in the attic of his parents' home in Bray, County Wicklow, Ireland. A mid-tempo soul song, its lyrics detail Hozier's frustration with the Catholic Church and its stance on homosexuality. It first caught the attention of independent label Rubyworks, where producer Rob Kirwan overdubbed the original demo with live instruments. Only two musicians feature on the track, Andrew Hozier-Byrne (Hozier) and drummer Fiachra Kinder. The song's music video has contributed to its widespread popularity. The clip, directed by Brendan Canty and Conal Thomson of the small production company Feel Good Lost, follows the relationship between two men and the subsequent violent homophobic backlash. Upon its YouTube release in September 2013, it quickly began to go viral, leading to Hozier's license with Columbia Records. In 2014, the song achieved widespread global popularity, topping the charts in 12 countries, and also reached the top 10 in 21 other territories. In the United States, it was aided by music platform Shazam and Spotify to become a rock radio hit (where it spent 23 consecutive weeks at the top of the Hot Rock Songs chart, tied with Imagine Dragons' \"Radioactive\" as the longest-running number-one in its history at the time), later crossing over to the all-genre Billboard Hot 100, where it peaked at number two in December 2014. The song was nominated for the Grammy Award for Song of the Year at the 57th Annual Grammy Awards. The song has been certified five times platinum in the US."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"Got a Hold on Me\" is a 1984 song from Fleetwood Mac's keyboardist/vocalist Christine McVie. The song rose to number 10 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, and it topped the Billboard Adult Contemporary and Rock Tracks charts for four and two weeks, respectively. This was McVie's only top 10 solo hit in the United States. Synthesizers on the track were played by Steve Winwood, while the guitars were played by Todd Sharp (the song's co-writer) and McVie's Fleetwood Mac bandmate Lindsey Buckingham. The other musicians were bassist George Hawkins and drummer-percussionist Steve Ferrone. Got a Hold on Me was released as the lead single from McVie's self-titled 1984 solo album. The video for the song was produced and directed by Jon Roseman and premiered in February 1984. Shot in both black-and-white and color, it is a pseudo-performance video showing Christine McVie in a mansion-like room singing at her piano while a backup band appears in silhouette shadows on the walls around her."@en ;

dbr:What_Becomes_of_the_Brokenhearted	rdf:type	dbo:MusicalWork ;
	dbo:abstract	"\"What Becomes of the Brokenhearted\" is a hit single recorded by Jimmy Ruffin and released on Motown Records' Soul label in the summer of 1966. It is a ballad, with lead singer Jimmy Ruffin recalling the pain that befalls the brokenhearted, who had love that's now departed. The song essentially deals with the struggle to overcome sadness while seeking a new relationship after the passing of a loved one. The tune was written by William Weatherspoon, Paul Riser, and James Dean, and the recording was produced by Weatherspoon and William \"Mickey\" Stevenson. \"What Becomes of the Brokenhearted\" remains one of the most-revived of Motown's hits. Composers Weatherspoon and Riser and lyricist Dean had originally written \"What Becomes of the Brokenhearted\" with the intention of having The Spinners, then an act on Motown's V.I.P. label, record the tune. Jimmy Ruffin, older brother of Temptations lead singer David Ruffin, persuaded Dean to let him record the song, as its anguished lyric about a man lost in the misery of heartbreak resonated with the singer. Ruffin's lead vocal on the recording is augmented by the instrumentation of Motown's in-house studio band, The Funk Brothers, and the joint backing vocals of Motown session singers The Originals and The Andantes. \"What Becomes of the Brokenhearted\" peaked at number seven on the Billboard Hot 100, and at number six on the Billboard R&B Singles chart. In Britain, it originally reached No. 8, and on reissue in 1974 No. 4, thus making it his highest-placed chart single in the UK. The song originally featured a spoken introduction by Ruffin, similar in style to many of Lou Rawls' performances at the time. The spoken verse was removed from the final mix, hence the unusually long instrumental intro on the released version. The spoken verse is present on the alternate mix from the UK 2003 release Jimmy Ruffin - The Ultimate Motown Collection, and as a new stereo extended mix on the 2005 anthology, The Motown Box:"@en ;
