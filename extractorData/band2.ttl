The name VIA Gra is both a reference to the drug Viagra and a play on words, since the first three letters stand for \"vocal-instrumental ensemble\" in Ukrainian, and \"hra\" means \"game\" in Ukrainian and it is also kind of a signature of the surnames of the two first girls of the group, VI-nnitskay-A and GRA-novskaya, the originally used maiden name of Nadya Meikher (Nu Virgos was a Ukrainian girl group that hit the charts in these countries in September 2000 with their first single \"Popytka No. 5\". Their first success outside the Russian language area was in May 2004 with the single \"Stop! Stop! Stop!\", an English version of their 2002 Russian song.

dbr:Enthroned	rdf:type	dbo:Band ;
	dbo:abstract	"Enthroned is a black metal band formed in Charleroi in 1993 by Cernunnos. He soon recruited guitarist Tsebaoth and a vocalist from grindcore/black metal band Hecate who stayed until the end of December 1993. Then bassist/vocalist Sabathan joined. The band released a 5-track demo tape in mid-1994 which brought them to the attention of several independent labels. A 7-inch split EP with Ancient Rites was then released by the underground label Afterdark Records. After the label's demise, Evil Alliance Records (a sub-label of Osmose Productions) released Enthroned's first full-length release, Prophecies of Pagan Fire. Shortly thereafter, the band enlisted second guitarist Nornagest. Eventually, Tseboath was replaced by Nebiros. In 1996, along with Ancient Rites and Bewitched, Enthroned began an extensive tour of Europe. In April 1997, as Enthroned was to begin recording Towards the Skullthrone of Satan, Cernunnos hanged himself. Enthroned recorded the album with a session drummer in honor of Cernunnos and performed at the Dragons Blaze festival with newly acquired drummer Namroth Blackthorn. In April 1998, the band toured the European continent with Dark Funeral and also released the MCD Regie Axese, which was dedicated to their former drummer Cernunnos. Later that year, they toured again with labelmates Hecate Enthroned and Usurper. At the close of 1998, the band entered Abyss Studios (Sweden) to record The Apocalypse Manifesto. The band's third album was released in May 1999 and dealt with the biblical concept of the Apocalypse as interpreted by a Norse mythological perspective. Enthroned rounded off the 20th Century on tour with Marduk and continued to tour in Europe. In 2000, the band parted ways with Nebiros and recruited Nerath Daemon as their new guitarist, went on a German mini tour followed by several other European shows and recorded Armoured Bestial Hell at Real Sound Studio (Germany). This fourth album was released in April 2001. Namroth Blackthorn was replaced by Alsvid from the French black metal band Seth. Enthroned continued to play many live gigs in and around Europe, as well as in the US. In early 2002, Enthroned signed to Napalm Records releasing their fifth full-length recording, Carnage in Worlds Beyond, later that year. In June 2003, Nguaroth (guitars) and Glaurung (drums) joined Enthroned, which played a South American tour and released their sixth album, XES Haereticum. In 2005, Enthroned released their first official live album, Black Goat Ritual, recorded during their tour of Brazil. Enthroned parted ways with longtime vocalist Sabathan, at which time Nornagest took over the vocals and Phorgath joined the band on bass. In June 2007, Enthroned recorded their seventh album Tetra Karcist, seeing the return of old drummer Alsvid for the studio sessions. Ahephahim joined as the new official drummer in June 2007 and Enthroned signed with Regain Records in January 2008. At this time, some members of the band opened a recording studio, Blackout Multimedia. In the meantime, Ahephaim and Nguaroth left the band due to lack of time and were replaced by ex-Gorgoroth drummer Garghuf. Nerath Daemon took back the position he left five years ago in Enthroned, changing his name to Neraath. Enthroned's eight album, Pentagrammaton, was released on 22 March 2010. Since then, Nornagest has given up playing guitar in live performances, due to chronic tendinitis in his wrist, and has instead become the band's frontman. Former members Lord Sabathan and Nguaroth joined the band for a one-off live performance in 2010 as an act of reconciliation. In September 2011, Enthroned announce that their collaboration with Regain Records has ended while the band was busy recording their ninth studio album."@en ;

Rick Didjit) on guitar/vocals, Doug Evans on bass, and Rick's brother Brad Sims, on drums. Didjits were known for the aggressive guitar playing and persona of Rick Sims, who often baited the audience between songs, and took plenty of abuse for it. Moreover, the band also added odd stunts and theatrical bits to some of their stage shows, particularly when playing in Chicago and Champaign. They released their first album in 1987 on Bam Bam Records and disbanded in 1994, but briefly reunited in 2006. Brad Sims left the band in 1992. Former Scratch Acid drummer Rey Washam filled in for the Little Miss Carriage EP, and Todd Cole eventually took over as the drummer. Their song \"Killboy Powerhead\" was covered by The Offspring on their breakthrough 1994 album Smash."@en ;

Originally founded under the Madhat moniker, they recruited a bassist (one of nearly a half-dozen who would come and go until 2005) and released the independent EP Freak in 1993. This received the attention of local radio station CKBW who would feature the trio prominently through local programming bringing Madhat to a wider audience. 1995 would bring about Hardhitters, the band's second EP followed by Full Length in 1998, the boys' first full-length effort. The critical success of the latter elevated Madhat to a national audience. In 2005, Madhat renamed themselves Air Traffic Control. They released a new self-titled album on February 12, 2005 to critical acclaim and garnering a nomination for New Group of the Year at the Nova Scotia Music Week conference.

Since the early 1980s, the Austrian musician and songwriter Helmut Glavar has founded a variety of bands, ranging from punk and funk to new wave and drums-and-bass. Piers Oak-Rhind was born in England and has been a sound designer, programmer and musician since the early 1990s. He studied guitar at the London School of Guitar. According to the two members, the music mixes \"coloristic electrophonics\" with \"impressionistic orchestra-like sound\".[citation needed] The use of both eastern and western vocals, tribal-sounding instruments, and an array of synthesizers built the foundation of the Entheogenic sound. According to some people[who?], Entheogenic was one of the two major psybient projects (the other being Shpongle) whose experimentation influenced the psychedelic electronic scene. Entheogenic's first release Entheogenic is a concept album that recounts the tale of an Ayahuasca journey, with layered trance melodies and texturally rich arrangements. Three labels bid for the release:[citation needed] the former UK-based Flying Rhino, the German-based Cosmophilia and the Spanish 3D Vision. The album was released on 3D Vision Records. In 2003, their second album Spontaneous Illumination, released on c.o.r.n. recordings, was the first psy-chill album ever to make it to number 1 in the German chill-out charts. Their first two albums were noted[by whom?] for their epic thematic lengthly tunes. Both albums feature the work of sound engineer Glenn Schick (Morcheeba, Ludacris etc.) In 2005, Dialogue of the Speakers (Chillcode Records) continued the success of its predecessor, and went straight to number 1 in the German charts, where it remained for 24 weeks.[citation needed] Golden Cap (Chillcode Records) was released in 2006 and was received by their then quite large following[clarification needed] with a love-hate attitude.[citation needed]"@en ;

The group also made several television appearances and played at the Vans Warped Tour. The relationship between the group and Geffen faltered during the making of their album, Sweat It Out. Disagreements over money led Decious and Ferrari to leave the band. Sweat It Out was released independently in September 2008. The Pink Spiders went on hiatus in 2009 and all three members pursued other musical projects. Friction, Decious, and Ferrari eventually reunited and performed at The Viper Room in June 2010; Friction officially announced their return.

One of the albums also has the name 424 \u2013 Mozdonyopera (\u2018424 \u2013 Locomotive Opera\u2019), and when they performed their farewell concert on 17 May 1992, as a show element they arrived to the Nyugati p\u00E1lyaudvar (\u2018Budapest West railway station\u2019) on a steam locomotive."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"The Comas formed in Chapel Hill, NC, in March 1998 as a joke country band, a sort of counterweight to the hyped No Depression movement. Before long, however, both the \"joke\" and the \"country\" parts of the concept were eliminated, thus allowing the band to develop into a quirky alternative rock outfit. The Comas' respectable 1999 debut, Wave to Make Friends, was composed of sleepy (but not lethargic) indie pop and off-kilter boy-and-girl vocal harmonies, courtesy of co-founders Andrew Herod and Nicole Gehweiler. The band's instrumental canvas proved to be larger and more eclectic than that of the typical indie group, buoying the usual guitars and rhythm section with violin, organ, and creative non-rap samples. Faced with the challenge of labeling such music, the Comas' label billed deemed the sound \"stoner pop.\" The Comas issued Def Needle in Tomorrow during the fall of 2000; however, it was the 2004 release of Conductor that finally put the band on the map. Recorded after the collapsed relationship of frontman Andrew Herod and actress Michelle Williams, Conductor proved to be a fine breakup album, gathering accolades from major music magazines while also expanding the band's fan base. Riding on that success, the Comas signed with Vagrant in December 2005, and the ever-evolving band\u2014which at this point was composed of Herod, Gehweiler, keyboardist Matt Sumrow, bassist Jason Caperton, and drummer Nic Gonzales\u2014released Spells in the spring of 2007.

This album was re-released in 2000 by Century Media Records as a 2-CD set, featuring a bootlegged live gig as a bonus disc. After the departure of Owens, St. Paul took over the vocal duties for both the unreleased Season of Brutality and Girth, arguably Winters Bane's heaviest work to date. Following the release of Girth, Winters Bane went into a period of semi-activity while searching for a full-time vocalist. By 2003, German Alexander Koch (ex-Spiral Tower, Powergod) was recruited and a demo was cut. Two years later St. Paul, Koch and veteran drummer Mark Cross entered the studio to record Redivivus, a full-length album released in 2006. After the release of the album, Koch and Cross were replaced by locally based Jeff Zaigen and former touring drummer Jeff Curenton and there are plans for a sequel to Heart of a Killer to be released in 2007. Former members Tim Owens and Dennis Hayes would later form their own band, Beyond Fear, and they released their debut album in 2006. The next year, Hayes would also join Owens in Iced Earth as their new bassist. As early as December 2007, it was rumored that due to Matt Barlow's reunion with Iced Earth (thus the booting of Tim Owens), Tim Owens would return to Winters Bane as its vocalist. These rumors were confirmed, as it was announced that talks of said reunion are under way. \"If the right conditions are met,\" said guitarist Lou St. Paul, \"we would put forth our best effort, making of course a 'killer' album, and do a major tour.\" The rumors also state this follow-up would be a direct sequel to Heart of a Killer."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Poupp\u00E9e Fabrikk is a Swedish EBM band, started in 1988 by Henrik Bj\u00F6rkk and Leif Holm, who both hail from Karlskoga. Initially, the music of Poupp\u00E9e Fabrikk (PF) borrowed heavily from minimalistic electronic acts such as Deutsch Amerikanische Freundschaft and Nitzer Ebb, but with the addition of Jouni Olilla and Jonas Aneheim on guitar PF moved towards a more Die Krupps-style electronic/metal mix. The \"Your Pain - Our Gain\" CD was meant to be released in 1996, but due to differences in opinion between the band and the record company (Energy Rekords) it was delayed until 1999. In 1996 the band decided to take a break and PF was put on hold and the band members worked on various solo projects. In 2000 the band re-united for a gig at the Tinitus Electronic Festival and announced that they were making a comeback and returning to their roots. They released a four track mini CD entitled \"Elite Electronics\". A year later though, both Jouni and Henrik left the band to concentrate on their respective solo careers. PF disbanded shortly afterwards. After seven years of absence from the scene the band re-united in 2009, Christian R filling the place of former member Jouni Ollila. In October 2010, they once again re-united for a gig; this time at Bodyfest on Fryshuset."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Iron Savior is a German power metal band that formed in Hamburg, Germany in 1996. Following a period of several years working behind the scenes in music production, multi-instrumentalist and producer/engineer Piet Sielck joined with former Helloween bandmate Kai Hansen and then-drummer for Blind Guardian Thomen Stauch in a new project that would blend power metal with a high-concept science fiction story. The band's debut album Iron Savior introduced the story that would be told over the course of multiple albums, featuring a self-aware space vessel called the Iron Savior and its relationship to the mythical lost civilization of Atlantis. Critics have compared Iron Savior's sound and musical approach to classic heavy metal bands like Judas Priest, Iron Maiden, and Queensr\u00FFche. Kai Hansen's presence in the band brought to the Iron Savior albums on which he appeared a style heavily influenced by Gamma Ray and Helloween. Since its inception, Iron Savior has released nine studio albums, two EPs, two singles and one live album. Despite numerous lineup changes, Piet has continued to direct the band and is currently the only remaining founding member."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Sandy & Junior was a Brazilian pop music duo consisting of siblings Sandy Leah Lima (born January 28, 1983) and her brother Durval de Lima Junior (born April 11, 1984).They first gained notoriety by being the children of Xoror\u00F3 from popular country duo Chit\u00E3ozinho & Xoror\u00F3.Sandy & Junior began by singing children's songs and country-influenced tracks (their first single, \"Maria Chiquinha\", is a classic country song). Once they reached adolescence, they changed their style to pop-influenced songs, mainly ballads and upbeat songs. They had a self-titled weekly television series between 1999 and 2002 on Rede Globo and released the movie Acquaria in 2003; Sandy also starred in the soap opera Estrela Guia (Globo) in 2001. Earlier, they had appeared in Renato Arag\u00E3o movie O Novi\u00E7o Rebelde, in 1997.On April 17, 2007 Sandy & Junior announced that an MTV Unplugged album to be recorded in May 2007 would be their final work together, through a video posted on their website addressed to their fans and in a press conference, stating also that their career as a duo would be over at the end of 2007.Both have experienced solo work: Junior moved on to being the drummer of alternative rock band Nove Mil Anjos (which also featured former Charlie Brown Jr. member Champignon on bass guitar); Sandy, on the other hand, took a couple of years off to finish her Bacherlor's Degree in Portuguese/English and marry long-time beau Lucas Lima, who not only happened to share her last name, but is also a well-known classical/pop musician, composer and head of the musical group Fam\u00EDlia Lima. In 2009, Junior took on the artistic name of Junior Lima and started a series of guest appearances on the concerts of Crossover Live, created by DJ Julio Torres and Amon Lima, (also from Fam\u00EDlia Lima and Lucas Lima's brother). The Crossover Live project plays on night clubs mixing classical music from a live violin and electronic music from a DJ. The guest appearances turned into yet another branch of the already alternative project, called Dexterz. Junior is currently touring both South and North Americas with Dexterz, and taking on occasional jobs as a music producer and/or director.In 2010, Sandy released her first solo album, \"Manuscrito\", which was produced by husband Lucas Lima and brother Junior Lima. She co-wrote every single track and is now touring the country. The album was certified platinum in Brazil and reached number four in the ABPD official albuns chart. Their 17 years of career has granted them partnerships with several national and international artists, such as Xuxa, Roberto Carlos, Milton Nascimento, Laura Pausini, Toquinho, Gilberto Gil, Ivete Sangalo, Enrique Iglesias and Andrea Bocelli, and more than 17 million albums sold around the globe, making them the ninth best selling Brazilian artists of all time."@en ;

Although they have played music together since they were boys, the brothers have only been a working band since 1995. The Bacon Brothers also appear on Sandra Boynton's children's CDs Dog Train, and Philadelphia Chickens, on which they sing the title track. Their song \"Chop Wood (Carry Water)\" is on the soundtrack of the 2004 film The Woodsman, which Kevin produced and starred in. Their song \"When You Decide You've Stayed Too Long\" is on the soundtrack of the 2003 film Red Betsy. Kevin starred in and produced Loverboy with his wife Kyra Sedgwick, which Michael also scored. In January 2006, the Bacon Brothers appeared on an episode of Queer Eye for the Straight Guy. The episode featured Michael Bacon as the episode's \"straight guy\" and makeover recipient, and ended with both Bacon Brothers performing. In 2008, Michael composed many soundtracks for television, including the soundtrack for the PBS mini series The Jewish Americans and The Kennedys for which he won an Emmy. In February 2009, the Bacon Brothers were the special guests for Episode 16 of Live From Daryl's House, Daryl Hall's (of Hall & Oates fame) monthly free internet concert. They performed four tracks off their most recent album, as well as some cover songs and the Hall & Oates track \"When The Morning Comes\". In early 2009 The Bacon Brothers did Hard Rock Cafe's March on Stage with the proceeds going to March On Stage, which is about helping people who make a difference, about giving back to those people that give selflessly of themselves. In the show closing, they were joined on stage by Matt Morris. In April 2009 they recorded \"Private Sessions\" which aired on the A&E channel. A new single, \"Guilty of the Crime\", a duet with The Bellamy Brothers, was released in June 2009. On June 27, 2009 The Bacon Brothers gave a brief concert, for the fundraisers who climbed to the top of Pikes Peak, Colorado, in support of the Love Hope Strength Foundation. The event was videoed by Matt Carpenter, high altitude marathoner and posted on their Myspace page. Later that night, The Bacon Brothers played a concert at the Denver Hard Rock Cafe. Also playing were Cy Curnin of The Fixx, and The White Buffalo. The Bacon Brothers toured in fall 2009 throughout the US East Coast. In 2009, Kevin and Michael teamed up with Philadelphia singer Bunny Sigler and a group of mummers from a local string band to record a special edition of their song \"New Years Day\" as a part of a fundraiser to be able to pay for the Mummers Parade in 2010 after the city could no longer fund the parade. An MP3 of the recording was sold online and people paid donations to purchase the song. In addition, they performed a one night only benefit on December 5, 2009 at the Electric Factory in Philadelphia, PA which was broadcast live. The concert included numerous performances such as The Fralinger String Band, and Bunny Sigler onstage with the band. Though many of the people in the crowd were from the Philadelphia area and had ties with the mummers, fans from various cities and states came out to support the band that night and the 2010 Mummers Parade took place. For their service, Kevin and Michael were given positions of grand marshals in the parade. On May 6 and 7, 2011, The Bacon Brothers gave two concerts for the new non-profit California Dream Week design contest and event week. The concerts were geared to help promote the event's first year launch and awarded both students and high schools focusing on sustainable design for a healthy planet. Seven students from around California were awarded scholarships for their projects in architecture and design, Transportation, and Product Compliments during an award ceremony prior to the May 7 concert."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"The Fall of Troy is an American post-hardcore band from Mukilteo, Washington. The band is a trio consisting of Thomas Erak (guitars, vocals, keyboards), Andrew Forsman (drums, percussion) and Tim Ward (bass, screamed vocals) who was later replaced by Frank Ene following his departure from the band in late 2007. Ene would remain in the band until their initial break-up in 2010, but Ward rejoined the band in Ene's place for their reunion in 2013. The trio is known for their technical, intricate style, unorthodox song structures and energetic stage presence. Erak's alternating guitar riffs and rhythmic chord work, paired with unconventional time signatures set the band apart from other post-hardcore bands during their career. They were also known for interchanging clean vocals and harsh screams, which was often split between Erak and Ward, respectively. Over the course of their career, the group released four full-length albums, one EP, and one single. Prior to The Fall of Troy's formation, when each member was about 17 years old, all three founding members were in another group named The 30 Years War, who released two EPs."@en ;

dbr:ZOEgirl	rdf:type	dbo:Band ;
	dbo:abstract	"ZOEgirl is an American Christian teen pop and pop rock band formed in 1999. The group comprised Chrissy Conway-Katina, Alisa Childers and Kristin Swinford-Schweain. They were signed to Sparrow Records from 1999 to 2006 and released their debut single \"I Believe\" in 2000. This song and their self-titled debut album ZOEgirl helped them become Sparrow's fastest selling artist of all time. With All of My Heart, the lead single for Life, was the group's only No. 1 Christian contemporary hit radio (CHR) single and led to the group receiving a GMA Dove Award for New Artist of the Year in 2002. By the end of 2003, over one million albums from ZOEgirl were sold. As a response to the musical trends of the time, ZOEgirl changed their format from teen pop to pop rock with the release of \"You Get Me\" in 2003. Released as the lead single for their third album, Different Kind of Free, this was their only No. 1 Christian adult contemporary (AC) single. It also peaked at No. 2 on CHR, making it the second-highest ZOEgirl song on that chart. The group's musical change and the growing digital piracy at the time led to slower sales of ZOEgirl's music. Their highly anticipated fourth and final studio album Room to Breathe earned the No. 1 spot on Billboard's Top Heatseekers Album charts. It was ZOEgirl's least successful album in terms of US Christian radio airplay, with only \"About You\" and \"Scream\" released as singles and the latter being unsuccessful. Both songs were better received in Australia. In 2006, ZOEgirl took a seven-year hiatus, during which they would form the band COLMANblue in 2008. This new band, featuring Kelli Trontell instead of Childers, split up in January 2010. In 2011, the group reunited for a two-hour interview on The Brian Mason Show, suggesting that they may release a lullaby album in the future. On May 24, 2013, Chrissy registered the ZOEgirlMusic.com domain name with Go Daddy. The group confirmed that they have reunited to create the lullaby album."@en ;

The group is composed of Joseph Bruce and Joseph Utsler, who perform under the respective personas of the \"wicked clowns\" Violent J and Shaggy 2 Dope (originally 2 Dope). Insane Clown Posse performs a style of hardcore hip hop known as horrorcore and is known for its elaborate live performances. The duo has earned two platinum and five gold albums. According to Nielsen SoundScan, the entire catalog of the group has sold 6.5 million units in the United States and Canada as of April 2007. Originally known as JJ Boyz and Inner City Posse, the group introduced supernatural- and horror-themed lyrics as a means of distinguishing itself stylistically. The duo founded the independent record label Psychopathic Records with Alex Abbiss as manager, and produced and starred in the feature films Big Money Hustlas and Big Money Rustlas. They formed their own professional wrestling federation, Juggalo Championship Wrestling, and later collaborated with many well-known hip hop and rock musicians. The group has established a dedicated following called Juggalos numbering in the \"tens of thousands\". The songs of Insane Clown Posse center thematically on the mythology of the Dark Carnival, a metaphoric limbo in which the lives of the dead are judged by one of several entities. The Dark Carnival is elaborated through a series of stories called Joker's Cards, each of which offers a specific lesson designed to change the \"evil ways\" of listeners before \"the end consumes us all\"."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Mayhem is a Norwegian black metal band formed in 1984 in Oslo, regarded as one of the pioneers of the Norwegian black metal scene. Mayhem's career has been highly controversial, primarily due to their violent stage performances, the 1991 suicide of vocalist Per Yngve Ohlin (\"Dead\") and the 1993 murder of guitarist \u00D8ystein Aarseth (\"Euronymous\") by former member Varg Vikernes (\"Count Grishnackh\"), of Burzum. The group released a demo and an EP that were highly influential, and amassed a loyal following through sporadic and notorious live performances, attracting further attention through their ties to the string of Norwegian church burnings and the prominent incidents of violence surrounding them. They disbanded after Aarseth's murder, shortly before the release of their debut album, De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas, regarded as a classic of the black metal genre. Surviving former members Jan Axel Blomberg (\"Hellhammer\"), J\u00F8rn Stubberud (\"Necrobutcher\") and Sven Erik Kristiansen (\"Maniac\") reformed two years later with Rune Eriksen (\"Blasphemer\") replacing Aarseth. Attila Csihar and Krister Dreyer (\"Morfeus\") have since replaced Kristiansen and Eriksen, respectively. The band's music strongly influenced the black metal genre and was instrumental in moving the global black metal scene away from the prevailing trend for speed metal. Their post-Aarseth material is characterised by increased experimentation. The 2007 album, Ordo Ad Chao, received the Spellemannprisen award for best metal Album."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"The Church are an Australian psychedelic rock band formed in Sydney in 1980. Initially associated with new wave, neo-psychedelia and indie rock, their music later came to feature slower tempos and surreal soundscapes reminiscent of dream pop and post-rock. Glenn A. Baker has written that \"From the release of the 'She Never Said' single in November 1980, this unique Sydney-originated entity has purveyed a distinctive, ethereal, psychedelic-tinged sound which has alternatively found favour and disfavor in Australia\". The Los Angeles Times has described the band's music as \"dense, shimmering, exquisite guitar pop\". The founding members were Steve Kilbey on lead vocals and bass guitar, Peter Koppes and Marty Willson-Piper on guitars and Nick Ward on drums. Ward only played on their debut album and the band's drummer for the rest of the 1980s was Richard Ploog. Jay Dee Daugherty (ex-Patti Smith Group) played drums from 1990 to 1993, followed by Tim Powles (ex-The Venetians) who remains with them to the present day. Koppes left the band from 1992 to 1997 and Willson-Piper left in 2013. He was replaced by Ian Haug, formerly of Powderfinger. Kilbey, Koppes and Powles also recorded together as \"The Refo:mation\" in 1997. The Church's debut album, Of Skins and Heart (1981), delivered their first radio hit \"The Unguarded Moment\" and they were signed to major labels in Australia, Europe and the United States. However, the US label was dissatisfied with their second album and dropped the band without releasing it. This put a dent in their international success, but they returned to the charts in 1988, with the album Starfish and the US Top 40 hit \"Under the Milky Way\". Subsequent mainstream success has proved elusive, but the band retains a large international cult following and were inducted into the ARIA Hall of Fame in Sydney in 2011. The Church continue to tour and record, releasing their 24th studio album, Further/Deeper, in October 2014."@en ;

dbr:The_Pointer_Sisters	rdf:type	dbo:Band ;
	dbo:abstract	"The Pointer Sisters are an American R&B singing group from Oakland, California, that achieved mainstream success during the 1970s and 1980s. Spanning over four decades, their repertoire has included such diverse genres as pop, disco, jazz, electronic music, bebop, blues, soul, funk, dance, country and rock. The Pointer Sisters have won three Grammy Awards and received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 1994. The group had 13 US top 20 hits between 1973 and 1985. The group had its origins when sisters June and Bonnie Pointer began performing in clubs in 1969 as \"Pointers, a Pair\". The line-up grew to a trio when sister Anita Pointer joined them. They scored a record deal with Atlantic Records and released several unsuccessful singles. The trio grew to a quartet when sister Ruth joined in December 1972. They then signed with Blue Thumb Records, recorded their debut album, and began seeing more success, winning a Grammy Award in 1975 for Best Country Vocal Performance for \"Fairytale\" (1974). Bonnie left the group in 1978 to commence a solo career with only modest success. The group achieved its greatest commercial success as a trio during the 1980s consisting of the line-up of June, Ruth, and Anita, winning two more Grammys for the top 10 hits \"Jump (for My Love)\" (1984) and \"Automatic\" (1984). The group's other U.S. top 10 hits are \"Fire\" (1979), \"He's So Shy\" (1980), \"Slow Hand\" (1981), the remixed version of \"I'm So Excited\" (1984) and \"Neutron Dance\" (1985). June Pointer, who left the group in 2004, died of cancer in 2006. She was replaced by Ruth's daughter Issa Pointer. This trio had a number two hit in Belgium in 2005, covering \"Sisters Are Doin' It for Themselves\" with Belgian singer Natalia. Since 2009, the group has consisted of Anita, Ruth, Issa, and Ruth's granddaughter Sadako Pointer. While all four women remain in the group, they most often perform as a trio rotating the lineup as needed."@en ;

The band's current lineup consists of James Mercer (vocals, guitar, songwriter), Joe Plummer (drums), Jessica Dobson (guitar), Yuuki Matthews (bass), Nick Teeling (glockenspiel), and Richard Swift (keyboards). The band is based in Portland, Oregon. The band was formed by Mercer and original drummer Jesse Sandoval as a side project to Flake Music, who were active from 1992 to 1999. The band released two 7\" singles and a full-length album When You Land Here It's Time to Return on Omnibus Records and were touring with Modest Mouse when they were signed to Sub Pop Records. The band's first two records, Oh, Inverted World (2001) and Chutes Too Narrow (2003) performed well commercially and received critical acclaim. The single \"New Slang\" brought the band mainstream attention when it was featured in the 2004 film Garden State. Consequently, the band's third album, Wincing the Night Away (2007), was a major success for the group, peaking at number two on the Billboard 200 and earning a Grammy Award nomination. Following this, the Shins signed to Columbia Records and Mercer parted ways with the entire original lineup, deeming it \"an aesthetic decision\". Following a near five-year hiatus, Port of Morrow, the band's fourth studio album, was released in 2012."@en ;

Former members Matt Tong and Gordon Moakes left the band in 2013 and 2015 respectively. Their brand of music, whilst rooted in rock, retains elements of other genres such as electronica and house music. The band was formed at the 1999 Reading Festival by Okereke and Lissack. They went through a variety of names before settling on Bloc Party in 2003. Moakes joined the band after answering an advert in NME magazine, while Tong was picked via an audition. Bloc Party got their break by giving BBC Radio 1 DJ Steve Lamacq and Franz Ferdinand's lead singer, Alex Kapranos, a copy of their demo \"She's Hearing Voices\". In February 2005, the band released their debut album Silent Alarm. It was critically acclaimed and was named Indie Album of the Year at the 2006 PLUG Awards and NME Album of the year which both honour indie music. That year, the record was also certified platinum in Britain. The band built on this success in 2007 with the release of their second studio album, A Weekend in the City, which reached a peak of number two in the UK Albums Chart and number twelve in the Billboard 200. In August 2008, Bloc Party released their third studio record, Intimacy which entered the UK Albums Chart at number eight and number eighteen on the Billboard 200. The band went on a hiatus in October 2009 to focus on side projects. They reunited in September 2011, and shortly thereafter released their fourth album, Four, which entered the UK Albums Chart at number three. In 2013, Bloc Party released their third EP titled The Nextwave Sessions in August; the band then began an indefinite hiatus to continue with their respective side projects. The band's fifth studio album, Hymns, the first to involve Harris and Bartle, was released on 29 January 2016. Bloc Party have sold over 3 million albums worldwide."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Canned Heat is an American rock band formed in Los Angeles in 1965. The group has been noted for its interpretations of blues material and for its efforts to promote interest in this type of music and its original artists. It was launched by two blues enthusiasts, Alan Wilson and Bob Hite, who took the name from Tommy Johnson's 1928 \"Canned Heat Blues\", a song about an alcoholic who had desperately turned to drinking Sterno, generically called \"canned heat\". After appearances at the Monterey and Woodstock festivals at the end of the 1960s, the band acquired worldwide fame with a lineup consisting of Bob Hite (vocals), Alan Wilson (guitar, harmonica and vocals), Henry Vestine and later Harvey Mandel (lead guitar), Larry Taylor (bass), and Adolfo de la Parra (drums). The music and attitude of Canned Heat afforded them a large following and established the band as one of the popular acts of the hippie era. Canned Heat appeared at most major musical events at the end of the 1960s, performances blues standards along with their own material and occasionally indulging in lengthy 'psychedelic' solos. Two of their songs \u2013 \"Going Up the Country\" and \"On the Road Again\" \u2013 became international hits. \"Going Up the Country\" was a remake of the Henry Thomas song \"Bull Doze Blues\", recorded in Louisville, Kentucky, in 1927. \"On the Road Again\" was a cover version of the 1953 Floyd Jones song of the same name, which is reportedly based on the Tommy Johnson song \"Big Road Blues\", recorded in 1928. Since the early 1970s, numerous personnel changes have occurred, although the current lineup includes all three surviving members of the classic lineup: de la Parra (who has remained in the band since first joining in 1967), Mandel, and Taylor. For much of the 1990s and 2000s, de la Parra was the only member from the band's 1960s lineup. He wrote a book about the band's career. Larry Taylor, whose presence in the band has not been steady, is the other surviving member from the earliest lineups. Mandel, Walter Trout and Junior Watson are among the guitarists who gained fame for playing in later editions of the band. British blues pioneer John Mayall found several musicians for his band among former members of Canned Heat."@en ;

The name Doro has also been associated with the touring band accompanying the singer, whose members have continuously changed in more than twenty years of uninterrupted activity, the most stable presences guaranteed by bassist Nick Douglas and drummer Johnny Dee. Doro started her career in garage bands in native D\u00FCsseldorf underground scene and achieved media visibility and some commercial success with Warlock in the 1980s. Warlock were starting to have an opening in the US market, when they went through many line-up changes and Pesch was left the only original member of the band. She started a solo career under the name Doro, in order to avoid legal battles between her record label PolyGram and her former manager. She released two albums in the US with producers Joey Balin and Gene Simmons, but they were not the breakthrough that she hoped. During the rise of grunge and alternative rock in the 1990s, her record label relegated her productions only to the European region, where she continued to tour extensively. She remained a successful charting artist in Germany, despite living and producing her albums in the US. When classic heavy metal found again the favour of the public, she returned to tour all over the world and her popularity as a veteran singer grew considerably, inspiring many new female metal artists. Doro is also known for her duets performed both live and in studio with other singers and musicians of the metal scene, whom she has befriended in her long career. To this date, she has released sixteen studio albums, the latest being Raise Your Fist in 2012. Doro continues her recording career and is prolific touring artist all over the world.

dbr:Fall_Out_Boy	rdf:type	dbo:Band ;
	dbo:abstract	"Fall Out Boy is an American rock band formed in Wilmette, Illinois, a suburb of Chicago, in 2001. The band consists of vocalist and guitarist Patrick Stump, bassist Pete Wentz, guitarist Joe Trohman, and drummer Andy Hurley. The band originated from Chicago's hardcore punk scene, with which Wentz was heavily involved. The group was formed by Wentz and Trohman as a pop punk side project of their respective hardcore bands, and Stump joined shortly thereafter. The group went through a succession of drummers before landing Hurley and recording their debut album, Take This to Your Grave (2003). The album became an underground success and helped the band gain a dedicated fanbase through heavy touring, as well as some moderate commercial success. With Wentz as the band's lyricist and Stump as the primary composer, the band's 2005 major-label breakthrough, From Under the Cork Tree, produced two hit singles, \"Sugar, We're Goin Down\" and \"Dance, Dance,\" and went double platinum, transforming the group into superstars and making Wentz a celebrity and tabloid fixture. Fall Out Boy received a Best New Artist nomination at the 2006 Grammy Awards. Their 2007 follow-up, Infinity on High, landed at number one on the Billboard 200 with 260,000 first week sales. It produced two worldwide hit singles, \"This Ain't a Scene, It's an Arms Race\" and \"Thnks fr th Mmrs.\" Folie \u00E0 Deux, the band's fourth album, created a mixed response from fans and commercially undersold expectations. Following the release of Believers Never Die - Greatest Hits, the band took a hiatus from 2009 to 2012 to \"decompress,\" exploring various side projects. They regrouped and recorded Save Rock and Roll (2013), which gave the band their second career number one and produced the 5x platinum top 20 single \"My Songs Know What You Did in the Dark (Light Em Up).\" Their sixth studio album, American Beauty/American Psycho (2015), released worldwide on Island Records, was preceded by the 4x Platinum top 10 hit \"Centuries\" and also spawned the 2x platinum single \"Uma Thurman\" which peaked at 22 on Hot 100. The album peaked at No. 1, making it the group's third No. 1 album and their fifth consecutive top 10 album. While Fall Out Boy's music has been typically described as pop punk and pop rock, the band were generally seen in the mid-2000s at the forefront of the \"emo pop\" explosion. Take This to Your Grave has commonly been cited as an influential blueprint for pop punk music in the 2000s."@en ;

During the band's career, it has released nine full-length albums and has evolved through a succession of styles, including industrial metal, death metal, groove metal, and thrash metal. Factory was enormously influential on the heavy metal scene in the mid-to-late 1990s. Fear Factory disbanded in March 2002 following some internal disputes, but reformed later that year without founding member Dino Cazares, adding bassist Byron Stroud, and previous bassist Christian Olde Wolbers as guitarist. In April 2009, a new lineup was announced. Cazares returned as lead and rhythm guitarist, and Gene Hoglan as drummer. Bell and Stroud reprised their respective roles, and the band completed a seventh studio album titled Mechanize. Former members Christian Olde Wolbers and Raymond Herrera\u2014both of whom were playing in Arkaea\u2014disputed the legitimacy of the new lineup, and a legal battle from both parties was begun. Fear Factory released its eighth studio album, The Industrialist, in June 2012. Their latest album, Genexus, was released in August 2015. Over the years, Fear Factory has seen changes in its members, with lead vocalist Burton C. Bell being the only consistent member since 1989. The band has performed at three Ozzfests and the inaugural Gigantour. Its singles have charted on the US Mainstream Rock Top 40 and albums on the Billboard Top 40, 100, and 200. The band has sold more than a million albums in the U.S. alone.[citation needed]"@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Five Iron Frenzy (also known as Five Iron or FIF) is a Christian ska band formed in Denver, Colorado in 1995, disbanded in 2003, then reunited again in 2011. The band released a new single and announced they were recording additional new material on November 22, 2011. The band's music is most heavily influenced by ska and punk rock, but their influences also include heavy metal. Their songs often include salsa-style shouting, sophisticated literary and music references. The band was signed to 5 Minute Walk in 1996, and stayed with the label for nine of its releases. Two other albums were self-released, and another was released through Asian Man Records. The band never received any significant music industry awards, and received relatively little attention in mainstream media. Their biggest national exposure came when their song, \"Oh, Canada\" (which referenced William Shatner), appeared on the TV series Boston Legal (in which Shatner stars) in October 2005, almost two years after their last show. For some of the earlier BriTANicK web videos their outro would be the song \"Far, Far Away\" from the album Five Iron Frenzy 2: Electric Boogaloo. Over the course of their career they sold close to one million units in total. They are known for their positive lyrics with a Christian message and energetic live shows. They often performed their concerts while wearing full costumes (mostly vocalist Reese Roper); on one tour the entire band wore Star Trek uniforms. The band was known for their themed tours, sometimes using them to raise awareness for social causes. On more than one tour they told fans to bring sock puppets on stage and help sing along. The socks, and fresh-bought socks alike, were then donated to a local homeless shelter. The band played shows at both churches and secular venues throughout their career. The band's name began as an inside joke, and the band was generally known for their humour, displayed throughout their albums and on stage. Recurring lyrical themes included the continuing injustices done to Native Americans, the evils of consumerism, Christian hypocrisy, the shortcomings of the band, and the joy of finding renewal in their Christian faith."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Franz Ferdinand are a Scottish rock band, formed in 2002 and based in Glasgow. The band is composed of Alex Kapranos (lead vocals and guitar, keyboard), Nick McCarthy (rhythm guitar, keyboards and backing vocals), Bob Hardy (bass guitar), and Paul Thomson (drums, percussion and backing vocals). The band has been known for being one of the most popular post-punk revival bands. They have been nominated for several Grammy Awards and have received two Brit Awards\u2014winning one for Best British Group, as well as one NME Award. The band began by releasing their debut extended play, Darts of Pleasure, in 2003, under Domino Records. The band gained recognition in the United Kingdom after the EP's title track peaked at number 44 on UK Singles Chart. In January 2004, the band released the song \"Take Me Out\". The song went on to achieve global recognition, charting in several countries, and earned a nomination for Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal at the 47th Annual Grammy Awards. It has since been noted as the band's signature song and has received critical acclaim from critics. The band subsequently released their eponymous debut studio album on 9 February 2004 to critical acclaim. The album won the 2004 Mercury Prize and earned a nomination for Best Alternative Album at the same Grammy award show. In the following year, the band released their second studio album, You Could Have It So Much Better, which was produced by Rich Costey. The album went on to earn critical acclaim from critics as well as a positive commercial performance, peaking within the top-ten in multiple countries. The album earned a nomination for Best Alternative Album and one of the singles released from the album, \"Do You Want To\", earned a nomination for Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal at the 48th Annual Grammy Awards. The band's third studio album, Tonight: Franz Ferdinand, was announced in late 2008 and released in January 2009. The album was notable for featuring a change in the band's musical style, as the band had shifted from a post-punk-focused sound, which was featured on their first two albums, to a more dance-oriented sound. The album gained a positive commercial performance as well as positive reviews, but not as much acclaim as their first two albums. A remix album of Tonight, titled Blood, was subsequently released in July 2009. Later that year, it was announced that the band had sold over three million albums worldwide. Four years later, the band released their fourth studio album, Right Thoughts, Right Words, Right Action. In 2015, it was announced that Franz Ferdinand and American rock band Sparks had formed the supergroup FFS. The two released the album FFS in June 2015."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Heavenly, a power metal and neo-classical metal band based in Marseille, France, was formed in 1993 in Paris by vocalist Benjamin Sotto and drummer Max Pilo, originally as a cover band under the name of Satan's Lawyer. In 1994, they changed their name to \"Heavenly\" and evolved into a full-fledged Helloween-influenced power metal outfit. In 1998, they released a three-track demo with new guitarist Anthony Parker. However, Parker's time with the band was to be short lived, leaving before a record deal with Noise Records was clinched. Heavenly then found a replacement in Chris Savourey and completed their lineup with bassist Laurent Jean. In 2000, Heavenly released their debut album Coming from the Sky. Although it was largely shunned by the media, the album proved a hit with metal fans and its success helped Heavenly land an appearance at the French Hard Rock Festival. With the arrival of a keyboardist, Fr\u00E9d\u00E9ric Leclercq, and the replacement of departed bassist Laurent Jean with Piere-Emmanuel Pelisson, Heavenly underwent another lineup change shortly before they supported Stratovarius on their 'Infinite' tour. Chris Savourey left soon afterwards, and Fr\u00E9d\u00E9ric Leclercq took on his role as the band's guitarist. Heavenly released their second album Sign of the Winner in 2001, and received positive feedback from both fans and media alike. For their following support slot on Edguy's European tour, Charley Corbiaux joined as a second guitarist, and has since become a permanent addition to Heavenly's ranks. After appearing at Wacken Open Air (the world's biggest metal festival) in 2002, Heavenly set to work recording their third album, Dust to Dust, which was eventually released in early 2004, further solidifying their status as one of France's premier power metal bands. In 2006, Heavenly released their fourth album, titled Virus. It is a departure from previous efforts, incorporating less double-bass drumming and expanding Sotto's vocal range. They opened for Scorpions during their 2007 French tour. In December 2009, they released their fifth album Carpe Diem."@en ;

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jane\u0027s_Addiction>	rdf:type	dbo:Band ;
	dbo:abstract	"Jane's Addiction is an American rock band from Los Angeles, California, formed in 1985. The band consists of Perry Farrell (vocals), Dave Navarro (guitar), Stephen Perkins (drums) and Chris Chaney (bass). Founded by Farrell and bass guitarist Eric Avery, following the disintegration of Farrell's previous band Psi Com, Jane's Addiction was one of the first bands from the early 1990s alternative rock movement to gain both mainstream media attention and commercial success in the United States. Jane's Addiction launched with a live self-titled debut album in 1987 and quickly caught the attention of Warner Bros. Records. The band's following first two major-label studio albums, Nothing's Shocking (1988) and Ritual de lo Habitual (1990), were released to widespread critical acclaim, and an increasing cult fanbase. As a result, Jane's Addiction became icons of what Farrell dubbed the \"Alternative Nation\". The band's initial farewell tour, in 1991, launched the first Lollapalooza, which has since become a perennial alternative rock festival. The band briefly reunited in 1997, with Flea, of the Red Hot Chili Peppers, replacing Avery on bass guitar. In 2001, a second reunion took place, with Martyn LeNoble\u2014and later Chris Chaney\u2014occupying the role of bass guitarist. In 2003, the band released its third major-label studio album, Strays, before dissolving again the following year. In 2008, the band's original line-up reunited and embarked on a world tour. Eric Avery, however, subsequently left the band in early 2010 as the group began work on new material. The band released its fourth studio album The Great Escape Artist in 2011, with Chaney returning to the band for its recording and subsequent tour."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Kiss (often styled as KISS) is an American hard rock band formed in New York City in January 1973 by Paul Stanley, Gene Simmons and the band's original manager, Lew Linet. Well known for its members' face paint and stage outfits, the group rose to prominence in the mid-to-late 1970s with their elaborate live performances\u2014which featured fire breathing, blood-spitting, smoking guitars, shooting rockets, levitating drum kits, and pyrotechnics. The band has gone through multiple lineup changes, with Stanley and Simmons the only remaining original members. Counting the 1978 solo albums, Kiss has been awarded 30 gold albums to date, the most of any American band. The band has sold more than 40 million albums in the United States, of which 25 million have been certified by the RIAA and their worldwide sales exceed 100 million records, making them one of the world's best-selling bands of all time. The original and best-known lineup consisted of Stanley (lead vocals and rhythm guitar), Simmons (vocals and bass guitar), Ace Frehley (lead guitar and vocals) and Peter Criss (drums and vocals). With their make-up and costumes, they took on the personae of comic book-style characters: The Starchild (Stanley), The Demon (Simmons), The Spaceman or Space Ace (Frehley) and The Catman (Criss). Stanley became the \"Starchild\" because of his tendency to be referred to as a \"starry-eyed lover\" and \"hopeless romantic\". The \"Demon\" make-up reflected Simmons' cynicism and dark sense of humor, as well as his affection for comic books. Frehley's \"Space Ace\" make-up was a reflection of his fondness for science fiction, technology,and his supposedly being from another planet. Criss' \"Catman\" make-up was in accordance with the belief that he had nine lives, because of his rough childhood in Brooklyn. Due to creative differences, both Criss and Frehley departed the group by 1982. The band's commercial fortunes had waned considerably by that point. Buoyed by a wave of Kiss nostalgia in the 1990s, the band announced a reunion of the original lineup in 1996. The resulting Kiss Alive/Worldwide Tour was the top-grossing act of 1996 and 1997. Criss and Frehley have both since left the band again and have been replaced by Eric Singer and Tommy Thayer, respectively. Kiss has been named in many \"Top\" lists. These include Number 10 on VH1's \"100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock\", 9th on \"The Greatest Metal Bands\" list by MTV, number one on Hit Paraders's \"Top 100 Live Bands\", 56th on VH1's \"100 Greatest Artists Of All Time\", and 26th on Gibson's \"50 Greatest American Rock Bands\". On April 10, 2014, Kiss was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame."@en ;

Malice Mizer was as famous for their music as for their live shows, featuring lavish historical costumes and stage sets, short silent theater pieces preluding various songs, and even a particularly notable instance of the vocalist descending to Earth (the stage) as a fallen angel, only to ascend again at the end of the concert. Throughout their history, the band has gone through several different lineups and three drastic image changes. On December 11, 2001, it was announced that Malice Mizer would go on an indefinite hiatus.

By 1990, in the Melbourne suburb of Moorabbin, they were renamed as Mortification with the line-up of Rowe, Michael Carlisle on guitar and Jayson Sherlock on drums. Mortification has released over twenty albums and several videos on major record labels such as Nuclear Blast. As one of the earliest internationally successful Christian death metal bands from Australia, they served as an inspiration for later similar groups. During the early 1990s Mortification played death metal, thrash, and grindcore, and \"belonged to the elite of the death metal movement,\" especially with their 1992 album Scrolls of the Megilloth. After the departure of Sherlock, Mortification began experimenting with groove metal, hardcore punk and power metal. They achieved commercial success with Blood World in 1994 and received critically acclaim for 1996's EnVision EvAngelene. Despite the lack of subsequent commercial success or mainstream critical recognition, \"the band, in spite of their extreme sound, are some kind of superstars in the 'White Metal' scene\", and have been described as \"a legend in the death metal scene.\" In late 1996, Rowe was diagnosed with acute lymphatic leukaemia and took 18 months to recover. Mortification issued their tenth album, Triumph of Mercy in August 1998 and accompanied it with a tour of North America. By August 1999, the band had sold a total of a quarter of a million albums across Europe and the US. They returned to their death/thrash roots for the 2004 album, Brain Cleaner."@en ;

The original intent of Nil was to become Tetsu's solo unit and even though it has become a full fledged band, all lyrics and songwriting has been solely handled by Tetsu. The band only lasted briefly during its first incarnation and went on hiatus by the end of 1998. It would not resurface until the middle of 2002 when they would start recording again and Tetsu formed his own record label, Afro Skull Records. The name \"Nil\" literally means \"absolute zero\" and as an acronym refers to \"native irreligious language\". In 2005, Nil had many setbacks which resulted in the departure of founding members Kashimoto and Moro who both left the band on January 10, 2005, the last day of the \"Touring Inferno\" tour. Eventually replacement drummer Furuton (ex-Oblivion Dust, ex-Mega8Ball support) left the band after only 6 months. By the end of 2005 Nil finally settled down with the addition of Masaru Kobayashi (ex-Soy Sauce Sonix, ex-Sads, The Cro-Magnons) on bass and Kazama Hiroyuki (ex-Fantastic Designs) on drums.

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Petra_(band)>	rdf:type	dbo:Band ;
	dbo:abstract	"Petra is a music group regarded as a pioneer of the Christian rock and contemporary Christian music genres. Formed in 1972, the band took its name from the Greek word for \"rock\". Though they disbanded formally in 2006, incarnations of Petra have played reunion shows in the years since and released an album in November 2010. In 2013, the band returned from retirement with a new drummer Cristian Borneo and recorded a new song titled \"Holy is Your Name\", as well as going back on tour. With a style initially similar to The Eagles and Lynyrd Skynyrd, Petra's sound evolved into a more energetic, driving rock sound in the early 1980s akin to Foreigner, Styx and Journey. Throughout the 1980s and into the early 1990s, Petra was one of the world's most popular Christian rock bands, with each of its albums during that period selling hundreds of thousands of copies while the band sold out arenas and regularly placed songs at the top of Christian radio charts. With its lyrics, music and style, Petra influenced numerous other artists at a time when Christian rock experienced strong opposition from many conservative pastors and churches. In more than three decades, the band experienced numerous lineup changes yet released 20 studio albums, as well as three Spanish-language and two live albums, selling nearly 10 million copies while being nominated for 13 Grammy Awards, winning four, and winning 10 Dove Awards. Its biggest hit, \"The Coloring Song,\" reached the top position on three Christian radio charts simultaneously, and at its peak, the band's tours rivaled Amy Grant's in popularity among Christian audiences. Petra was the first rock band inducted into the Gospel Music Hall of Fame and the first Christian band whose memorabilia was included in the Hard Rock Cafe restaurant chain. The band announced its retirement in 2005, launching a farewell tour that was recorded for release on CD and DVD. Petra's 33-year career ended with a performance in the early hours of January 1, 2006, in Murphy, North Carolina. However, the band has continued to perform sporadically since then. In November 2010, an incarnation of the band's mid-1980s lineup surfaced under the name Classic Petra. They released a CD titled Back to the Rock featuring two new songs as well as re-recordings of hits from that era. The band released a companion live CD and DVD in 2011."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Queensr\u00FFche /\u02C8kwi\u02D0nzra\u026Ak/ is an American heavy metal band formed in 1982 in Bellevue, Washington, out of the local band the Mob. The band has released 14 studio albums, one EP and several DVDs, and continues to tour and record. The original lineup consisted of vocalist Geoff Tate, guitarists Chris DeGarmo and Michael Wilton, bassist Eddie Jackson and drummer Scott Rockenfield. Queensr\u00FFche has sold over 20 million albums worldwide, including over 6 million albums in the United States. The band received worldwide acclaim after the release of their 1988 album Operation: Mindcrime, which is often considered one of the greatest concept albums of all time.[citation needed] Their follow-up release, Empire, released in 1990, was also very successful and included the hit single \"Silent Lucidity\". The band has received three Grammy Award nominations for songs off both albums. In 1998, drummer Rockenfield received an individual Grammy nomination. In 1997, guitarist and primary songwriter DeGarmo left the band for personal reasons. Over the years, his replacements have been Kelly Gray, Mike Stone, and Parker Lundgren, respectively. Following a highly publicized backstage altercation before a show in S\u00E3o Paulo, Brazil in April 2012, Tate was fired from the band and replaced with then-Crimson Glory singer Todd La Torre. In response to his dismissal, Tate and his wife Susan (who served as the band's manager from 2005\u20132012) filed a lawsuit in a Washington court, claiming that he was wrongfully terminated. The ruling in the preliminary injunction was that both parties were allowed to use the name Queensr\u00FFche until a court ruling or a settlement decides who gets to use the name. A settlement was reached on April 17, 2014, in which founding members Wilton, Rockenfield and Jackson were awarded the rights to the band trademark, continuing to play with the lineup that additionally includes singer La Torre and guitarist Lundgren. During the time both parties could use the name Queensr\u00FFche, Tate created his own lineup featuring former guitarist Gray and musicians from bands including Blue \u00D6yster Cult, Ozzy Osbourne, Whitesnake, Dio, AC/DC and Quiet Riot. This version of Queensr\u00FFche with Geoff Tate released the album Frequency Unknown on 23 April 2013, while Queensr\u00FFche (with La Torre replacing Tate) released their eponymous album on 24 and 25 June 2013 (European and American release date, respectively). Both bands toured in 2013 and 2014."@en ;

dbr:Quiet_Riot	rdf:type	dbo:Band ;
	dbo:abstract	"Quiet Riot is an American heavy metal band, best known for their hit singles \"Metal Health\" and \"Cum on Feel the Noize\". The band was founded in 1973, by guitarist Randy Rhoads and bassist Kelly Garni under the name Mach 1. They then changed the name to Little Women, before settling on Quiet Riot in May 1975. The band's name was inspired by a conversation with Rick Parfitt of the British band Status Quo, in which Parfitt said he'd like to name a band \"Quite Right\", and his thick English accent made it sound like he was saying \"Quiet Riot\". The band is ranked at No. 100 on VH1's 100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock. The original line-up featured Rhoads and Garni with lead vocalist Kevin DuBrow and drummer Drew Forsyth. Their most commercially successful lineup consisted of DuBrow alongside guitarist Carlos Cavazo, bassist Rudy Sarzo and drummer Frankie Banali, and in 1983 released their breakthrough album Metal Health, which is known for being the first heavy metal album to top the Billboard album chart. Despite several lineup changes and brief breakups, Quiet Riot continued to record and tour until DuBrow's death from an accidental cocaine overdose in 2007. Banali revived the band in 2010, and the current lineup consists of himself on drums, lead vocalist Jizzy Pearl, bassist Chuck Wright and guitarist Alex Grossi. After eight years without published works, the band released their twelfth studio album in 2014, entitled 10, the first since the band's reformation following the death of Kevin DuBrow."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Second Person were a British band that existed for 10 years between 2001 and 2011 and mixed influences from trip hop, jazz, hip hop and electronica to form post-trip hop . In late 2001, singer Julia Johnson and producer/bassist Mark Maclaine met, and early the following year formed the band Second Person. Drummer \u00C1lvaro L\u00F3pez was recruited in mid-2004 to complete the final line up and their debut album Chromatography was released later that year. It went on to sell out of its initial white-label run in United Kingdom, USA and Australia through word of mouth and publicity generated by musical placements on documentaries and extreme sports films. The opening song \"Too Cold To Snow\" was later featured in the closing credits of 2006 film Dolls. The band went on to record a live DVD at The Bedford in London, score music for a number of British broadcasters (including BBC and Channel 4) and became one of the main suppliers of music for the international broadcaster: The Extreme Sports Channel. The band released their second album The Elements on 9 August 2007, it was co-produced and mixed by producer/engineer Tony Platt (Bob Marley, Iron Maiden and also credited with engineering the second biggest selling album of all time: AC/DC's Back in Black). This album gained a high media profile in Europe as Second Person were the first British band to have raised the $50,000 target on Sellaband - which allowed fans to invest directly in bands on the site. Julia and Mark composed the music for the British feature film City Rats, starring Danny Dyer and Tamer Hassan and released in the cinemas in April 2009. The film reached number 6 in the UK DVD charts and went on to sell over 400,000 copies world-wide . The band announced their split on 2 April 2011 , along with the release of their third and final album: \"Come to Dust\". This full length album includes songs such as Gone Fishing, the video for which (directed by Katy Davis) gained extensive play on MTV and was used as part of Cobra Beer's sponsorship of ITV movies in the UK. Other video directors include: Ebba Erikzon (Radiohead's \"2+2=5\" video), Mina Song (Gnarls Barkley: \"Crazy\"), Everton Sebben and Mark Maclaine. In a final email to their fans the band wrote: \"Second Person has always been an expression of our combined love of many styles of music and was founded on a shared desire to tell powerful stories. We had to do this during times of big change in the music industry, and although sometimes scary, it also allowed us to do things our own way. Something that kept us going was the support and love of a core group of dedicated fans. You are those people and we wanted to thank you for being there for us.\""@en ;

Steps formed in May 1997 and released four studio albums, three compilation albums and seventeen singles. Their music has a 1990s dance-pop, house, electropop and bubblegum dance sound. Their name was based on a marketing premise: that each of their music videos were to be choreographed, and the dance steps were included in the sleeve with most of their singles. Steps achieved a series of charting singles between 1997 and 2001 including two number-one singles in the UK (one a double A-side), two number-one albums in the UK, 14 consecutive top 5 singles in the UK and a string of hits throughout Europe. The group has sold over 20 million records worldwide in addition to acquiring a BRIT Award nomination in 1999 for Best Newcomer while supporting Britney Spears on tour the same year. When Richards and Watkins departed, the group disbanded on 26 December 2001. Their penultimate single reached number five in the UK charts while their final album of greatest hits, Gold (2001), was the group's second number-one album in the UK. Steps reformed in May 2011 for a four-part documentary series on Sky Living titled Steps: Reunion. The series started airing on 28 September, following an announcement of a second Greatest Hits album, The Ultimate Collection, that was released on 10 October 2011. The album entered the charts at number 1, becoming the band's third UK number 1 album. Series 2 of Steps Reunion titled \"Steps: On the Road Again\" aired on Sky Living in April 2012; the series followed the band as they embarked on their sellout 22-date UK tour. On 24 September 2012, the group confirmed they would release their fourth studio album Light Up The World on 12 November 2012, alongside a six-date Christmas tour, starting from 30 November and ending on 5 December."@en ;

After achieving early underground fame in UK, the band had their commercial breakthrough in mid-1980s and sustained it until the early 1990s, when they stopped releasing new recorded output in protest against their record company. Currently, the band is a touring outfit only. The group has released three original studio albums, of which the last was released in 1990. Each album was recorded by a different line-up; singer-songwriter Andrew Eldritch and the drum machine called Doktor Avalanche are the only points of continuity among the line-ups. Eldritch and Avalanche were also involved in The Sisterhood, a side-project connected with Eldritch's dispute with former members. The group ceased recording activity in 1993, when they went on strike against their record company Time Warner, which they accused of withholding royalties and of incompetence. Although Time Warner eventually let the band go in 1997, they have not signed to another label, and have chosen not to use an independent label, despite showcasing numerous new songs in their live sets. Since 1985, when the other original members left, the Sisters of Mercy has become the artistic vehicle of Eldritch. Former members of the group established the bands Ghost Dance and the Mission."@en ;

The group launched the careers of guitarists Eric Clapton, Jimmy Page and Jeff Beck, all of whom are in the top five of Rolling Stone's 100 Top Guitarists list (Clapton at No. 2, Page at No. 3 and Beck at No. 5). A blues-based band that broadened its range into pop and rock, the Yardbirds had a hand in many electric guitar innovations of the mid-1960s, such as feedback, \"fuzztone\" distortion and improved amplification. Pat Pemberton, writing for Spinner, holds that the Yardbirds were \"the most impressive guitar band in rock music\". After the Yardbirds broke up in 1968, lead guitarist Jimmy Page founded what became Led Zeppelin, while vocalist/harmonica player Keith Relf and drummer Jim McCarty formed the symphonic rock group Renaissance. The bulk of the band's most successful self-written songs came from Relf, McCarty and bassist and producer Paul Samwell-Smith, who, with rhythm guitarist and bassist Chris Dreja, constituted the core of the group. The band reformed in the 1990s, featuring McCarty, Dreja and new members. The Yardbirds were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1992.

The band currently consists of Pat Monahan (vocals), Jimmy Stafford (lead guitar), Jerry Becker (rhythm guitar and piano), Hector Maldonado (bass), Drew Shoals (drums), Nikita Houston (backing vocals) and Sakai Smith (backing vocals). With a lineup that included original members Monahan, Stafford, Scott Underwood, Rob Hotchkiss and Charlie Colin, the band achieved mainstream success with their debut album Train, which was released in 1998 with the hit \"Meet Virginia\". Train's 2001 album, Drops of Jupiter contained the lead single \"Drops of Jupiter (Tell Me)\", which won two Grammy Awards in 2002. The album was certified double platinum in the United States and Canada and remains the band's best-selling album to date. Train's third studio album, My Private Nation, released in 2003, was certified platinum in the United States with the hit \"Calling All Angels\". Following the departures of Hotchkiss and Colin, the band released their fourth album, For Me, It's You in 2006, with Brandon Bush (keyboards) and Johnny Colt (bass). Despite a generally positive reception from critics, the album was commercially unsuccessful. Because of this, Train went on a three-year hiatus. In late 2009, Train released the album Save Me, San Francisco, from which the album's three singles\u2014-the RIAA 6x Platinum-certified international hit \"Hey, Soul Sister\", \"If It's Love\" and \"Marry Me\"\u2014-reached high positions on the Billboard Hot 100 at numbers 3, 34, and 34, respectively. The album itself has been certified gold by both the RIAA and ARIA and has sold 954,000 units. Since 2008, Jerry Becker (guitar, keyboards, backing vocals) and Hector Maldonado (bass, guitar, percussion, backing vocals) have been touring and recording with the group around the world. In May 2012, Nikita Houston (backing vocals, percussion) and Sakai Smith (backing vocals, percussion) joined Train. Following Scott Underwood's departure in summer 2014, Drew Shoals is now the drummer for the band. In April 2012, Train released their sixth studio album titled California 37.

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tweaker_(band)>	rdf:type	dbo:Band ;
	dbo:abstract	"Tweaker is an American alternative rock collaboration founded by Chris Vrenna in the late 1990s. Tweaker's musical style incorporates synthpop, progressive rock, modern jazz and electronica genres, and is characterized by a generally melancholy and sombre sound with distinctive artwork to match. The album The Attraction to All Things Uncertain was Vrenna's \"solo\" debut and it was not until the follow-up album, 2 a.m. Wakeup Call, that Clint Walsh was announced as a permanent fixture to the band. While Vrenna and Walsh supply most instruments and electronics, many other famous musicians have lent their voices and talents to Tweaker, including Robert Smith, David Sylvian, Burton C. Bell, Craig Wedren, Will Oldham, Hamilton Leithauser, Buzz Osborne, Jonathan Bates and Johnny Marr. The albums that have been released follow a central theme that was planned out and this was given to the collaborators. Both albums' cover art were paintings by Joe Sorren. Tweaker wrote and performed the Soundtrack to Doom 3, Of which the theme song was released via the band's website. The rest of the soundtrack is accessible from the game's files. As Chris Vrenna and Clint Walsh, Tweaker did music for the animated television show Xiaolin Showdown. While the Doom 3 theme was Heavy Metal-oriented (to the point of often being misattributed to Tool), most of Tweaker's music presents a unique combination of synthpop, shoegaze, modern jazz, Dark Ambient and industrial. It was rumored for a while that Tweaker would release a new album in 2008, although no new material surfaced, possibly due to Vrenna's duties towards Marilyn Manson, as he worked with Manson on his 2009 album The High End of Low."@en ;

dbr:Habana_Abierta	rdf:type	dbo:Band ;
	dbo:abstract	"Habana Abierta is a Cuban band. They are a member of a generation of composers, musicians, sculptors, authors, actors, etc. which emerged in the early 90s with its own identity in Havana, even though some of their creations had already been well known for some years in the island's cultural circles. The origins of Habana Abierta go back to a personal project of music duo Gema y P\u00E1vel, who wanted to produce a compilation of everything they and their peers had been doing in Havana clubs with hardly any resources. Initially, Luis Alberto Barber\u00EDa, Pepe del Valle, Carlos Santos, Boris Larramendi, Superavit, Andy Villal\u00F3n, Kelvis Ochoa and Jos\u00E9 Luis Medina, backed by the NUBENEGRA recording label, gave us a first glimpse released under the name Habana Oculta. In July 1996 most of them travelled to Spain (except for Carlos Santos, Ra\u00FAl Ciro and Alejandro Fr\u00F3meta: Super\u00E1vit) to showcase their music at several festivals and clubs, and very soon spurred interest among audiences and the media alike, and even well-known Spanish artists and musicians. Ana Bel\u00E9n and V\u00EDctor Manuel, along with Ketama, were the first to show an interest and to take the initiative in a gradual and rich exchange with our Habana Abierta, which whom they made music in Spain. BMG Ariola asked Gema y P\u00E1vel to come up with a project bringing a group of highly different singer-songwriters together on the album, based on the individuality of each member yet with combined expression of the diverse unity of Cuban music. Then Vanito Brown and Alejandro Guti\u00E9rrez joined what was to become Habana Abierta, recording a new album under this name. They played over 80 gigs throughout Spain in 1997, 50 of them in Madrid and in 1998 recorded am album with the line-up down to 6, as Andy and Barber\u00EDa had left to branch out on their own. With 24 Horas, the second album with Habana Abierta, an eclectic line was followed with some tracks from previous recordings, with a more defined fusion between popular Cuban music and funk, reggae and hip-hop. Rock and Pop Cuban-style with national roots: Van Van by Juan Fromel, Irakere by Chucho Vald\u00E9s or NG la Banda by Jos\u00E9 Luis Cort\u00E9s, refrains attributed to Matamoros over Red Hot Chili Peppers or Rolling Stones riffs. Conga-funk, timba-rock, bolero-hop, chachacha-blues, son and pop.... In January 2003, after six years in Spain, they returned to Cuba for a series of sell-out individual shows, with a performance by the Habana Abierta full line-up at La Tropical, playing to with over 10,000 people. This gave rise to the Habana Abierta documentary directed by Jorge Perugorr\u00EDa and Arturo Soto, which was presented at several film festivals."@en ;

Initially a continuation of the defunct indie rock band Red House Painters, Sun Kil Moon is now the primary recording moniker of vocalist and guitarist Mark Kozelek. The project is named after the Korean lightweight boxer Sung-Kil Moon. Following the delayed release of Red House Painters' final studio album, Old Ramon (2001), vocalist and guitarist Kozelek began recording new material under the name Sun Kil Moon with bandmates Anthony Koutsos (drums) and Jerry Vessel (bass), alongside Geoff Stanfield and Tim Mooney. The resulting album, Ghosts of the Great Highway, was released in 2003 to widespread critical acclaim. The project's second studio album, Tiny Cities (2005), was composed entirely of Modest Mouse cover songs. In 2008, the band released its third studio album, April. Recorded as a three-piece by Kozelek, Koutsos and Stanfield, the album was well received and featured guest vocal appearances from noted indie rock musicians Will Oldham and Ben Gibbard. Inspired by classical guitar music, Kozelek recorded Sun Kil Moon's fourth studio album, Admiral Fell Promises (2010), as a solo act, and continued to record mostly alone on its follow-up, Among the Leaves (2012). In 2013, Kozelek released three studio albums under his own name before releasing Sun Kil Moon's sixth studio album, Benji, in February 2014, to widespread critical acclaim and increased exposure.

dbr:The_Sea_and_Cake	rdf:type	dbo:Band ;
	dbo:abstract	"The Sea and Cake is an indie rock band with a jazz influence based in Chicago. The group formed in the mid-1990s from members of The Coctails (Archer Prewitt), Shrimp Boat (Sam Prekop and Eric Claridge), and Tortoise (John McEntire); the group's name came from a willful reinterpretation (as the result of an accidental miscomprehension) of \"The C in Cake\", a song by Gastr del Sol. Starting with 1997's The Fawn, the group has relied on electronic sound sources, such as drum machines and synthesizers, to color its music, but has retained its distinctive post-jazz combo style. The band has shied away from releasing singles, preferring the album format. Contrary to his multi-instrumentalist role in Tortoise, John McEntire almost exclusively plays drums in The Sea and Cake. Members Sam Prekop, Archer Prewitt, and John McEntire each have released solo albums. The cover art of The Sea And Cake's releases are largely paintings by member Eric Claridge and photographs by Prekop. (Postcards of some of the One Bedroom-era photos were sold on the band's 2003 tour.) Prewitt has been involved in publishing his own comic books and doing graphic design. The band was on hiatus from 2004 to 2007, returning with Everybody. Their eighth studio album, Car Alarm, was released in October 2008. Their most recent studio album, \"Runner\" was released in 2012. In 1995, the band contributed the song \"The Fontana\" to the AIDS benefit album Red Hot + Bothered produced by the Red Hot Organization. In October 2010, the band released \"Skies\" as a special single to accompany their tour with Broken Social Scene."@en ;

Although the rest of the line-up has changed occasionally, for most of the time the other members have been Michael Wells, Glenn Slater and Terri Moeller. The band draws inspiration from folk and country music, particularly Townes Van Zandt, Neil Young and Johnny Cash, but also from other types of artists and musical styles such as Scott Walker, Leonard Cohen, French chanson and Jacques Brel. Their sound is typically rich, with string arrangements and keyboards in addition to the standard rock instruments. In reviews the band's music is often described as melancholic or mellow, while Eckman's lyrics, concerning such themes as human relations, loneliness and restlessness, are often emphasized as poetic. The Walkabouts have achieved commercial success and a strong fanbase in Europe, where they have done promotion and extensive touring since early 1990s. They have occasionally even made it high on the record charts in countries such as Greece and Norway."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Tit\u00E3s ([t\u0283i\u02C8t\u0250\u0303s]) are a rock band from S\u00E3o Paulo, Brazil. Though they basically play pop/alternative rock, their music has touched a number of other styles throughout their 30-year career, such as new wave, punk rock, grunge, MPB and electronic music. They are one of the most successful rock bands in Brazil, having sold more than 6.3 million albums and having been covered by several well-known Brazilian artists and a couple of international singers. They were awarded a Latin Grammy in 2009 and have won the Imprensa Trophy for Best Band a record four times. Tit\u00E3s started with a rather unusual line-up of nine members (including six lead vocalists): Nando Reis (bass guitar, vocals), Branco Mello (vocals), Marcelo Fromer (Rhythm guitar), Arnaldo Antunes (vocals), Tony Bellotto (Lead guitar), Paulo Miklos (sax, mandolin, harmonica, vocals), Andr\u00E9 Jung (drums), S\u00E9rgio Britto (keyboards, vocals) and Ciro Pessoa (vocals). Pessoa quickly left the band even before their debut album, Tit\u00E3s, was released. Andr\u00E9 Jung was the initial drummer, but just after Tit\u00E3s he also quit and was replaced by Charles Gavin, establishing their classic line-up. Since then, the band lost four members who were never officially replaced: in 1992, Antunes left to pursue a solo career. In 2002, Fromer died after being hit by a motorcycle in S\u00E3o Paulo. Six months later, Reis also left the group to focus on his solo albums. The most recent change was the departure of Gavin, in 2010, due to personal reasons. After Fromer's death and Reis' departure, the band performed with some session guitarists and bassists, but ended up having Mello and Britto as full-time bassists (with Britto performing only when Mello sings) and Miklos as the rhythm guitarist. After Gavin left, the band has been working with Mario Fabre, a session drummer. The band has released their latest album in May 2014, titled Nheengatu."@en ;

Over the last decade, the band has performed and toured with U2, Counting Crows and Def Leppard among many others, performing for hundreds of thousands of fans in venues all around the world from the UK to Dubai, and released six critically acclaimed albums. The band's debut album, All Comes Round, became the best-selling rock album in South African history. Their second album, Something for Now, was certified gold in only three weeks from release. Both albums achieved platinum certification. 2004 saw Just Jinger (as their name was then spelled) doing several arena shows with the Counting Crows and completed their own sold out tours of London and Dubai. In 2005, the band recorded their international debut album with Grammy Award-winning producer David Bianco in Los Angeles. In 2006 Just Jinger changed the spelling of their name to 'Just Jinjer', to avoid having the second word in their name mispronounced /\u02C8d\u0292\u026A\u014B\u0259r/ or /\u02C8d\u0292\u026A\u014B\u0261\u0259r/ instead of /\u02C8d\u0292\u026And\u0292\u0259r/.

	dbo:abstract	"Within Temptation is a Dutch symphonic metal band founded in 1996 by vocalist Sharon den Adel and guitarist Robert Westerholt. They have always been classified by critics as gothic metal or rock, although the \"gothic\" influence varies with each album. Their most prominent and well-known sound is described as symphonic metal, although their earlier material, such as debut album Enter, was mostly gothic metal. Enter even had a hint of doom metal. In an interview, Den Adel said they fell into a symphonic rock genre with various influences. In a later interview with Dutch music platform 3VOOR12, den Adel stated that \"we consider ourselves more a symphonic rock band ... in my opinion, we are no gothic band\". After the release of their debut album Enter in 1997, the band became prominent in the Dutch underground scene. It was not until 2001 that they became known to the general public, with the single \"Ice Queen\" from their second album Mother Earth, which reached No. 2 on the Dutch charts. This was followed by the band winning the Conamus Exportprijs, a Dutch music award, four years in a row. Their next albums The Silent Force (2004) and The Heart of Everything (2007) debuted at No. 1 on the Dutch charts. In 2008, they released a live DVD and CD, Black Symphony, recorded with the Metropole Orchestra. This was followed in 2009 by An Acoustic Night at the Theatre, another live album. The band's fifth studio album, The Unforgiving, was released in March 2011, alongside both a comic book series and a series of short films that together encompass a story. The first single, \"Faster\", was released on January 21, and the first short film, Mother Maiden, was released on January 31. The band has sold more than 3 million copies of the album worldwide. Their sixth studio album, Hydra, was released on January 22, 2014 in Japan, on January 31, 2014 in Europe, and on February 4, 2014 in the United States. The album features guest appearances from various artists: Finnish singer Tarja Turunen, who appears in the lead single \"Paradise (What About Us?)\"; Howard Jones, former vocalist of American metalcore band Killswitch Engage; Dave Pirner, lead vocalist of American alternative rock band Soul Asylum; and American rapper Xzibit. The band had extensive airplay on BBC Radio 2 in the United Kingdom with one of the songs from the album, \"Whole World Is Watching\" featuring Pirner. The band is currently working on new material and is due to tour The Netherlands as part of their \"Theater Tour\", a seated show. During 2014, they parted ways with artist management agency AT Productions and signed with Martijn Swier, with whom they had been working for many years."@en ;

The band got their name from the album Pornograffitti by the band Extreme. They currently record under the SME Records label. Haruichi Shind\u014D originally formed the band with his cousin during high school and named it \"No Score.\" After the band started, Haruichi asked Akihito Okano and Masami \"Tama\" Shiratama to join. The band was so named because none of them could actually read a score when they first started. When they first started the band, Haruichi was the vocalist, but found out that Akihito could sing better, so he gave the vocalist position to Akihito and took over as guitarist instead. This was the foundation of Porno Graffitti. They debuted with the song Apollo in 1999. Their two subsequent CD singles, Saudade and Agehach\u014D, both sold over a million copies in Japan. They are also well known for the song Melissa, which was used as the opening theme of the anime series Fullmetal Alchemist in 2003. They also created the song Hitori no Yoru, used as the second opening theme of the anime series GTO in 2000, and Winding Road, used as the ending theme of the anime series Ayakashi Ayashi in 2006. A cover of their 2000 single Music Hour was featured in a stage of the Nintendo DS rhythm game Moero! Nekketsu Rhythm Damashii Osu! Tatakae! Ouendan 2. Their single Koyoi, Tsuki ga, Miezu Tomo was featured in the third Bleach film, and their single Anima Rossa was featured as the eleventh opening to Bleach. Their single \"2012Spark\" was featured as the main theme song of the movie Gyakuten Saiban. Their single \"Matataku Hoshi no Shita de\" is the second opening theme for the anime Magi: The Labyrinth of Magic. Their newest single, \"Oh!

The band's name comes from The Gore Gore Girls, a 1972 B-movie by Herschell Gordon Lewis, which is a parody of the term Go Go Girls. Like fellow Detroit bands The White Stripes and The Detroit Cobras, the band started out struggling through the local club circuit before being \"discovered\" by independent record label Get Hip Records in 1998. Their first single \"Mama in the Movies\" (1999) gained favourable airplay on college radio stations in Michigan, which led to recording their first full-length album Strange Girls in (2000). The second album Up All Night, was released in 2002 and received positive press from the Village Voice and Detroit Free Press. During this time the band toured Europe twice, in 2002 and in 2003, also with infrequent dates in the United States. The band became a four-piece in 2004 with the addition of The Hammer (Marlene Hammerle) on guitar and began touring the United States extensively. Gore Gore Girls toured as direct support for The Cramps in 2003 and 2004. The band released an EP in 2004, 7 X 4, which became part of their third album, Get the Gore. Tracks from the EP and subsequent third album received airplay on Little Steven's Underground Garage Program on Sirius Satellite Radio; the band was featured at Little Steven's Underground Garage Festival on Randall's Island, New York along with other 'garage rock' luminaries and legends The Stooges, The Strokes, The New York Dolls, The Zombies and others. Get the Gore, released in 2007 on Bloodshot Records, was recorded at Ghetto Recorders in Detroit, Michigan and received positive press from USA Today and Playboy Magazine. Gore Gore Girls toured Europe again in spring of 2008, the band's third tour of Scandinavia and Western European countries."@en ;

The song \"Seven Days of Lonely\" was put iTunes as the service's \"free single of the week\" from February 19, 2008 - February 25, 2008. In the April 5, 2008 issue of Billboard, I Nine's second single \"If This Room Could Move,\" which was produced by Nickelback's Chad Kroeger, received a spotlight review by editor Chuck Taylor: \"I Nine catapulted out of native South Carolina when Cameron Crowe invited the quartet to appear on the motion pic soundtrack for his Elizabethtown. At year-end 2007, it grazed the adult top 40 top 25 with \"Seven Days of Lonely,\" the debut from upcoming CD Heavy Weighs the King \u2014 but that pep pill was a mere taste of the group\u2019s prowess. Sunny follow-up \"If This Room Could Move\" is garnering hype because Chad Kroeger produced \u2014 all well and good but bragging rights are earned on its own merits: an ambrosial vocal from Carmen Keigans, divine start-and-stop tempo, and instrumental elements that blend \u201890s jangle-rock with Brit pop. On record, they sound like a blissful union of Jewel and Sixpence None the Richer \u2014 if more Avril Lavigne live. With two exquisite singles in a row, I Nine is counting down to name-brand status.

The Color Fred was featured on a compilation by Equal Vision Records in 2005. Mascherino has worked with Macbeth Athletics to design and produce the F. P. Mascho, as part of Macbeth's Studio Projects. The shoe displays the drawings of Jude Ianelli that also appear on The Color Fred's official website, and some lyrics. On October 4, 2007, Fred left Taking Back Sunday to concentrate on his new project full-time. Bend to Break is TCF's first full-length album and was released on October 30, 2007. The album hit #8 on the Billboard Heatseekers chart. As of early fall 2008, The Color Fred now has a modlife site. The Color Fred released The Intervention EP in April 2009. The EP features new and old songs performed acoustic, plus two home demos. A DVD has been in the works for the band since early 2008. It will contrast the differences between life on the road with The Color Fred and Fred's former band, Taking Back Sunday. The project is currently on hold as Fred is focusing on his new band, Terrible Things with Andy Jackson and Josh Eppard. On the The Color Fred's Myspace page, Fred said the following about his solo project: \"A lot of people have been asking about TCF as well. I still love all the songs I've put out through that so it will continue to be my solo project that I'll do when the new band is on break... if it ever is! But I really feel that if you were ever a fan of the music I've been so lucky to make over the years, you won't be let down by the Terrible Things record. I want to thank you guys especially for supporting me all these years and especially during the last 2 years while I was rebuilding and rethinking everything about what I do. It really helped to have my TCF fans when things got hard. I won't let you guys down-Fred\" In 2012, Fred toured as The Color Fred for the Super Karate Tour"@en ;

dbr:Roger_Miret_and_The_Disasters	rdf:type	dbo:Band ;
	dbo:abstract	"Roger Miret and the Disasters are a street punk group formed by Agnostic Front frontman Roger Miret. The band started when Miret was writing songs that were not a style suitable for Lady Luck (a band fronted by his wife Denise) or Agnostic Front, so he starting recording them on his own on a Boss recorder. Johnny Rioux had previously mentioned he would like to work with him, so Rioux helped Miret on what originally started as a solo project. Then Miret met Rhys Kill, who liked the material and joined in on the project. The band then recorded a demo tape, with Miret and Kill on guitar, Rioux on bass and Matt Kelly from the Dropkick Murphys on drums. That six-song demo found reviewed by Lars Frederiksen, who passed it off to his Rancid bandmate Tim Armstrong. He asked Miret to put his project out on Hellcat Records. As Kelly could not continue with Miret due to his commitments with Dropkick Murphys, Miret asked Johnny Kray of The Krays and New York Rel-X to join on drums. After a couple rehearsals, they decided to make it a band. Their first recorded appearances were in 2001, with \"It's Alright\", from the six-song demo with Matt Kelly, appearing on Scene Killer 3 and covers of Cock Sparrer's \"England Belongs to Me\" (dubbed \"New York Belongs to Me\") and Blitz's \"Voice of a Generation\" appearing on The Worldwide Tribute to the Real Oi! Volume 2. Their debut release was their self-titled album, which came out in September 2002. The band's first lineup change came with Joey Nails replacing Rioux on bass by August 2003. It was then announced in January 2004 that Chris Watson replaced Nails and then Brian Darwas took over for drums as of April 2004, leaving only Miret and Kill as original members. Following one more lineup change, with Darwas moving over to bass and Mike Mulieri taking over drums as of September 2004, the band recorded their second album in Fall 2004. The album, 1984, was released early the next year and became their last release on Hellcat. The next year, they released My Riot on Sailor's Grave Records. In January 2011, the band released their fourth album, Gotta Get Up Now, on German label People Like You Records."@en ;

ns20:DC	rdf:type	dbo:Band ;
	dbo:abstract	"AC/DC are an Australian hard rock band, formed in November 1973 by brothers Malcolm and Angus Young, who continued as members until Malcolm's illness and departure in 2014. Commonly referred to as a hard rock or blues rock band, they are also considered pioneers of heavy metal and are sometimes classified as such, though they have always dubbed their music as simply \"rock and roll\". AC/DC underwent several line-up changes before releasing their first album, High Voltage, on 17 February 1975; Malcolm and Angus were the only original members left in the band. Membership subsequently stabilised until bassist Mark Evans was replaced by Cliff Williams in 1977 for the album Powerage. Within months of recording the album Highway to Hell, lead singer and co-songwriter Bon Scott died on 19 February 1980 after a night of heavy alcohol consumption. The group considered disbanding, but buoyed by support from Scott's parents, decided to continue and set about finding a new vocalist. Ex-Geordie singer Brian Johnson was auditioned and selected to replace Scott. Later that year, the band released the new album, Back in Black, which was made as a tribute to Bon Scott. The album launched them to new heights of success and became their all-time best-seller. The band's next album, For Those About to Rock We Salute You, was their first album to reach number one in the United States. AC/DC declined in popularity soon after drummer Phil Rudd was fired in 1983 and was replaced by ex-A II Z drummer Simon Wright, who left to join Dio in 1989. The band experienced a resurgence in the early 1990s with the release of The Razors Edge. Phil Rudd returned in 1994 after Chris Slade, who was with the band from 1989 to 1994, was asked to leave in favour of him, and contributed to the band's 1995 album Ballbreaker. Stiff Upper Lip was released in 2000 and was well received by critics. The band's studio album, Black Ice, was released on 20 October 2008 and was the second-highest-selling album of that year. It was their biggest hit on the charts since For Those About to Rock, eventually reaching No.1 on all charts worldwide. The band's line-up remained the same\u2014their longest unchanged line-up\u2014until 2014 with Malcolm Young's retirement and Rudd's legal troubles. AC/DC have sold more than 200 million records worldwide, including 71.5 million albums in the United States alone, making them the tenth-best-selling band in the United States and one of the world's best-selling bands of all time. Back in Black has sold an estimated 50 million units worldwide, making it the fifth-highest-selling album by any artist \u2013 and the third-highest-selling album by any band. The album has sold 22 million units in the US alone, where it is the sixth-highest-selling album of all time. AC/DC ranked fourth on VH1's list of the \"100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock\" and were named the seventh \"Greatest Heavy Metal Band of All Time\" by MTV. In 2004, AC/DC ranked No. 72 on the Rolling Stone list of the \"100 Greatest Artists of All Time\". Producer Rick Rubin, who wrote an essay on the band for the Rolling Stone list, referred to AC/DC as \"the greatest rock and roll band of all time.\" In 2010, AC/DC were ranked number 23 in the VH1 list of the \"100 Greatest Artists of All Time\"."@en ;

They disbanded for the first time after the release of their fifth album, 1987's VI, as Hetson decided to continue touring and releasing albums with Bad Religion. They reunited around 1994 and recorded a reunion album, Oddities, Abnormalities and Curiosities, during the following year, followed by a tour. After that, the Circle Jerks once again parted ways as Hetson was still involved in Bad Religion. They reunited again c. 2001, but as of 2010, are on hiatus. To date, Circle Jerks have released six studio albums, one compilation, a live album and a live DVD. Their last studio album, Oddities, Abnormalities and Curiosities, was released in 1995 and was the band's only reunion album to date.

The group is composed of eight (formerly nine) members: Taeyeon, Sunny, Tiffany, Hyoyeon, Yuri, Sooyoung, Yoona, and Seohyun. Girls' Generation officially debuted on August 5, 2007 with its debut single \"Into the New World\" and subsequently gained some attention with their self-titled debut album. However, it was not until 2009 that they rose to prominence with the single \"Gee\", which claimed the top spot on KBS's Music Bank for a record-breaking nine consecutive weeks and was named the most popular song of the 2000s decade by Melon. The group solidified their place in the South Korean music industry with follow-up singles \"Tell Me Your Wish (Genie)\", \"Oh!\", and \"Run Devil Run\" from late 2009 to early 2010. In mid-2010, the group signed with Nayutawave Records (present-day EMI Records Japan) to embark into the Japanese music scene. In April 2011, Girls' Generation's Japanese self-titled debut album was released, which peaked atop the Japanese Oricon Albums Chart and became the first album by a South Korean girl group to achieve a double Platinum certification by the RIAJ. The group returned to the South Korean music scene in October 2011 with The Boys, which has sold over 457,000 copies in South Korea, becoming the best-selling album in the Gaon chart history since its launch in 2010. During this time, the group also expanded their endeavor to the United States by signing with Interscope Records. In 2013, Girls' Generation's fourth Korean studio album titled I Got a Boy was released. The title track was subjected to major attention from western media after it was awarded Video of the Year at the inaugural YouTube Music Awards. Girls' Generation has sold over 4.4 million albums and 30 million digital singles as of 2012. The group's immense popularity in its native South Korea has earned them numerous accolades, notably titles such as \"The Nation's Singers\" and \"The Nation's Girl Group\". Girls' Generation is also regarded as the most popular K-pop girl group in Japan alongside Kara; the group is the first South Korean girl group to have two number-one albums on the Japanese Oricon Albums Chart. Korean newspaper Asia Today placed the group at 45 on its 50 Korean Power Leaders list in 2011."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Skinny Puppy is a Canadian industrial music group, formed in Vancouver, British Columbia, in 1982. The group is widely considered to be one of the founders of the electro-industrial genre. The band's logo consists of the stylized, superimposed letters SP and is a common fan tattoo. Initially envisioned as an experimental side project by cEvin Key while he was in the new wave band Images in Vogue, Skinny Puppy evolved into a full-time project with the addition of vocalist Nivek Ogre. Over the course of a dozen studio albums and many live tours, Key and Ogre have been the only constant members. Other members have included Dwayne Goettel (1986\u20131995), Dave \"Rave\" Ogilvie (long-time associate, producer, and \"unofficial\" fourth member until 1995), Mark Walk (2003\u2013present), and a number of guests, including Bill Leeb (1985\u20131986, under the pseudonym Wilhelm Schroeder), Al Jourgensen (1989), and many others. After the self-release of their first cassette in 1984, Skinny Puppy soon signed to Vancouver label Nettwerk, anchoring its early roster. From their Nettwerk debut EP Remission in 1984 to their 1992 album Last Rights, Skinny Puppy developed into an influential band with a dedicated cult following, fusing elements of ambient, noise, new wave, electro, and rock music and making innovative use of sampling. Over the course of several tours of North America and Europe in this period, they became known for theatrical, horror-themed live performances and videos, drawing attention to issues such as chemical warfare and animal testing. In 1993, Skinny Puppy left Nettwerk and long-time producer Rave, signing with American Recordings and relocating to Malibu, California, where drug problems and tension between band members plagued the recording of their next album, The Process. Ogre quit Skinny Puppy in June 1995, and Goettel died of a heroin overdose two months later. The album was completed with Rave and released in Goettel's memory in 1996. Key and Ogre, already active in a number of other projects, went their separate ways, reuniting for a one-off Skinny Puppy concert at the Doomsday Festival in Dresden, Germany, in 2000. Reforming Skinny Puppy in 2003 with Mark Walk, they have since released three albums on the German label Synthetic Symphony, and toured extensively."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"The Angels are an Australian rock band that formed in Adelaide, South Australia, in 1974. The band later relocated to Sydney and enjoyed huge local success, clocking up hit singles across four decades, including \"Am I Ever Gonna See Your Face Again\", \"Take a Long Line\", \"Marseilles\", \"Shadow Boxer\", \"No Secrets\", \"We Gotta Get Out Of This Place\", \"Let The Night Roll On\", and \"Dogs Are Talking\". The Angels were cited by Guns N' Roses and a number of Seattle grunge bands, including Pearl Jam and Nirvana, as having influenced their music. In the international market, to avoid legal problems with the Casablanca Records' act Angel, their records were released under the names Angel City and later The Angels from Angel City. Lead singer Doc Neeson who fronted the band from 1974-1999 left pre-Millenium due to spinal injuries sustained in a car accident. After spending most of the 2000s apart, in April 2008, the original 1970s line-up of The Angels reformed for a series of tours. In January 2013 it was announced that lead singer Doc Neeson had been diagnosed with a brain tumour and would undergo immediate treatment. Neeson died aged 67. It was also revealed that bassist Chris Bailey (1950\u20132013) had been battling an aggressive cancer. Bailey died on 4 April 2013; a benefit concert was held at Thebarton Theatre in Adelaide on 17 April."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"The Black Eyed Peas is an American hip hop group, consisting of rappers will.i.am, apl.de.ap, Taboo, and singer Fergie. Originally an alternative hip hop group, they subsequently added R&B and EDM influences. Although the group was founded in Los Angeles in 1995, it was not until the release of their third album Elephunk in 2003 that they achieved high record sales. Since that time, the group has sold an estimated 76 million records (35 million albums and 41 million singles), making them one of the world's best-selling groups of all time. According to Nielsen SoundScan, the Black Eyed Peas were the second-best-selling artist/group of all time for downloaded tracks, with over 42 million sales as of the end of 2011. Their first major hit was the 2003 single \"Where Is the Love?\" from Elephunk, which topped the charts in 13 countries, including the United Kingdom, where it spent seven weeks at number one and went on to become Britain's biggest selling single of 2003. Another European hit single from the album was \"Shut Up\". Their fourth album, Monkey Business, was an even bigger worldwide success, certified 4\u00D7 Platinum in the U.S., and spawning four singles, \"Don't Phunk with My Heart\", \"Don't Lie\", \"My Humps\" and \"Pump It\". In 2009, the group became one of only 11 artists to have simultaneously held the No. 1 and No. 2 spots on the Billboard Hot 100, with their singles \"Boom Boom Pow\" and \"I Gotta Feeling\", which topped the chart for an unprecedented 26 consecutive weeks. This album The E.N.D later produced a third Hot 100 number-one placement with \"Imma Be\", making the group one of few to ever place three number one singles on the chart from the same album, before being followed with \"Rock That Body\" and \"Meet Me Halfway\", which peaked in the Top 10 of the Hot 100. \"I Gotta Feeling\" became the first single to sell more than one million downloads in the United Kingdom. The Black Eyed Peas were ranked 12th on Billboard's Decade-End Chart Artist of the Decade, and 7th in the Hot 100 Artists of the Decade. At the 52nd Grammy Awards ceremony, held in January 2010, they won three awards out of six nominations. In November 2010, they released the album The Beginning. In February 2011, the group performed at the Super Bowl XLV halftime show. The album's first two singles, \"The Time (Dirty Bit)\" and \"Just Can't Get Enough\", became international hits and topped the charts in many countries. The single \"Don't Stop the Party\" became an international hit as well."@en ;

During the course of their career the band released six full-length albums on the labels Hollywood Records and Side One Dummy Records. Though they experienced several lineup changes over the years, founding members Jason Navarro and Dan Lukacinsky remained regular fixtures. The band's musical style initially blended elements of punk rock, ska, and hardcore into a genre popularly known as ska punk or \"ska-core,\" which characterized their first two albums. During the middle of their career they shifted gears, moving away from this sound and producing two albums with a heavy pop rock influence. Their final two albums moved back towards their mid-1990s style, bringing back heavy ska punk and hardcore elements. Despite being signed to a major record label for their first four albums, The Suicide Machines did not experience significant mainstream success. However, they did achieve a relatively high level of underground recognition through relentless touring, including multiple performances on the Warped Tour. This trend continued when the band moved to an independent label for their last four years, before their breakup brought an abrupt end to the band's career."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"All Saints are an English-Canadian girl group formed in London in 1993. Originally founded as All Saints 1.9.7.5 by members Melanie Blatt, Shaznay Lewis and Simone Rainford, the group struggled to find commercial success upon being signed to ZTT Records and were dropped by the label shortly after Rainford left the group. In 1995 the group were joined by sisters Nicole and Natalie Appleton and signed to London Records under their shortened name. All Saints became one of the most popular groups of the 1990s; marketed as an alternative to the Spice Girls with their edgy take on pop music, and signature crop top and cargo pants style which prompted a late 1990s British fashion trend. The group's debut album, All Saints (1997), peaked at number two on the UK Albums Chart and went on to become the third best-selling girl group album of all time in the UK. The Appleton sisters' private lives soon became a staple feature among tabloid newspapers to the extent that it detracted from the group's music. All Saints' second album, Saints & Sinners (2000), became their first number-one album and achieved multi-platinum success. Amid in-fighting among the group members, All Saints controversially split the following year. The group later reformed after signing to Parlophone Records to release their third album, Studio 1 (2006). However, the album bowed at number 40 in the UK and All Saints were dropped by Parlophone shortly afterward. Following a second split in 2009, the group reunited in 2014 for a series of well received live performances, prompting the group to sign to London for a second time for the release of their fourth album, Red Flag (2016). In their career, All Saints achieved a string of nine consecutive top-ten hits in the UK, including five number-ones: \"Never Ever\", \"Under the Bridge\"/\"Lady Marmalade\", \"Bootie Call\", \"Pure Shores\" and \"Black Coffee\". \"Never Ever\" is the second best-selling girl group single of all-time in the UK, behind the Spice Girls' \"Wannabe\". The group have also won two Brit Awards, two MTV Europe Music Awards and one Ivor Novello Award. As of January 2016, All Saints have sold 12 million records."@en ;

The band consists of lead vocalist and guitarist Myles Kennedy, lead guitarist and backing vocalist Mark Tremonti, bassist Brian Marshall, and drummer Scott Phillips. Since the band's formation, there have been no line-up changes. The band is known for their acclaimed live shows and extensive touring support on all continents. Following Creed's disbandment in 2004, former members Tremonti, Marshall, and Phillips began working with Kennedy, formerly of The Mayfield Four. Named after a bridge that once existed on Alter Road near Tremonti's former home in Detroit, Michigan, Alter Bridge released its debut album, One Day Remains, the same year. Despite mixed reviews, One Day Remains went on to be certified Gold by the RIAA. Driven by the release of the single \"Rise Today\", the band released its second album, Blackbird, to more positive reviews in 2007, embarking on a successful world tour in support. Tremonti, Marshall, and Phillips reunited with Creed for a tour and album in 2009, while Kennedy recorded two songs for guitarist Slash's self-titled solo album in 2010, before fronting his band for a supporting tour. During this time, Alter Bridge continued to write material, and released its third album, AB III, in 2010 to critical acclaim, while the single \"Isolation\" became the band's most successful single to date. The band embarked on a world tour in support of AB III from 2010 to 2012. Following the conclusion of the AB III tour, the members of Alter Bridge focused on other musical endeavors throughout 2012, including solo and session work, another Creed tour, and Kennedy's continued collaborations with Slash. Alter Bridge reconvened in early 2013 and released its fourth album, Fortress, to further acclaim later that year, also embarking on a world tour, lasting until November 2014.

	dbo:abstract	"Aterciopelados (English: The Velvety Ones), also referred to as Los Aterciopelados on some albums and other promotional materials, are a rock band from Colombia. Led by Andrea Echeverri and H\u00E9ctor Buitrago, they have been one of the first rock bands from Colombia to gain international notice and they are among the country's top groups. Their music fuses rock with a variety of Colombian and Latin American musical traditions. Time magazine wrote that \"Aterciopelados's true skill lies in its ability to take north-of-the-border musical styles\u2026and breathe new life into them, all while giving them a distinctly Colombian sheen.\" Additionally, Aterciopelados engages audiences all over the world with their socially conscious message. Honored by the United Nations for their work denouncing violence in Colombia, Aterciopelados speaks out about myriad issues including political injustice, women's rights, and environmental destruction. The group has also received numerous awards, such as the Latin Grammy Award for Best Alternative Album in 2007, for Oye (Nacional Records). In October 2008, Aterciopelados released a new studio album, Rio, on Nacional Records. The album received rave reviews from publications like Rolling Stone, the Washington Post, Billboard, and from NPR's All Things Considered. As Vibe Magazine said, \"For Aterciopelados, maturity has become a form of liberation.\" The group toured United States in April 2009 to support Rio."@en ;

dbr:Bad_Religion	rdf:type	dbo:Band ;
	dbo:abstract	"Bad Religion is an American punk rock band that formed in Los Angeles, California in 1979. The band makes extensive use of soaring three-part vocal harmonies (which they refer to in their album liner notes as the \"oozin' aahs\"), guitar solos and lyrics that often contain religious and political commentary. Their lyrics often relate to matters of social responsibility. The band's lineup has changed several times over its lifespan, with lead vocalist Greg Graffin being the only consistent member; the current lineup, however, features three of the band's four original members (Graffin, Brett Gurewitz and Jay Bentley). To date, Bad Religion has released sixteen studio albums, two live albums, three compilation albums, three EPs (one of which is composed of covers of Christmas songs) and two DVDs (which were both recorded live). They are considered to be one of the best-selling punk rock acts of all time, having sold over 5 million albums worldwide. Bad Religion had built an underground following in the United States with their early albums before signing to Atlantic Records in 1993. They rose to fame that same year with their seventh studio album Recipe for Hate, which peaked at number 14 on Billboard's Heatseekers chart. Recipe for Hate was followed a year later by Stranger than Fiction, which spawned their biggest hits \"Infected\" and a re-recorded version of \"21st Century (Digital Boy)\", and was certified gold in both the United States and Canada. Shortly before the release of Stranger than Fiction, Gurewitz left Bad Religion to focus on his label Epitaph, and was replaced by Brian Baker. Since the return of Gurewitz in 2001, the band has undergone a resurgence in popularity, with their sixteenth studio album True North (2013) becoming Bad Religion's first album to crack the top 20 on the Billboard 200 chart, where it peaked at number 19. The band is expected to release their seventeenth studio album around 2017."@en ;

dbr:Blind_Guardian	rdf:type	dbo:Band ;
	dbo:abstract	"Blind Guardian is a German power metal band formed in the mid-1980s in Krefeld, West Germany. They are often credited as one of the seminal and most influential bands in the power metal and speed metal subgenres. Ten musicians have been a part of the band's line-up in its history, which has consisted of singer Hansi K\u00FCrsch, guitarists Andr\u00E9 Olbrich and Marcus Siepen, and drummer Frederik Ehmke since 2005. Blind Guardian is a part of the German heavy metal scene that emerged in the mid-1980s. The band was formed in 1984 as Lucifer's Heritage by K\u00FCrsch (then also bass guitarist), Olbrich, other guitarist Markus D\u00F6rk and drummer Thomas Stauch. D\u00F6rk and Stauch both left the following year, and were replaced by Christof Thei\u00DFen and Hans-Peter Frey respectively, who left as well before the end of the year. In 1987, Siepen joined and Stauch returned; under this line-up, which lasted 18 years (the longest in the band's history), the band changed their name to Blind Guardian and released their first album, Battalions of Fear, in 1988. Over the releases, Blind Guardian established themselves as a notable successful band and as pioneers of the power metal movement. In 1996, K\u00FCrsch stopped acting as the band's bass guitarist to focus on vocals. Various session members replaced him, mainly Oliver Holzwarth. However, in 2005, Stauch left the band, disapproving of Blind Guardian's transition into a more complex progressive sound with a heavy use of backing vocals, and was replaced by Ehmke. Most of Blind Guardian's albums were well received by fans and critics alike: Somewhere Far Beyond (1992), Imaginations from the Other Side (1995), and Nightfall in Middle-Earth (1998), are especially seen as influential works. The music is mostly composed by K\u00FCrsch and Olbrich together, and the lyrics, written by K\u00FCrsch, are mostly inspired by the fiction of fantasy authors such as J. R. R. Tolkien, Michael Moorcock, Robert Jordan, Stephen King and George R. R. Martin as well as traditional legends and epics. Over the years a theme has developed which personifies the band members as travelling storytellers, leading fans to refer to the band affectionately as \"The Bards\"."@en ;

Most of its members currently play in various other groups and solo projects, mainly in the city of Toronto. The band refuses the label \"supergroup\", based on size or the ubiquity of their members, claiming that in the indie scene everyone is involved in more than one project.[citation needed] The group's sound could be considered a combination of all of its members' respective musical projects, and is occasionally considered baroque pop. It is characterized by a very large number of sounds, grand orchestrations featuring guitars, horns, woodwinds, and violins, unusual song structures, and an experimental, and sometimes chaotic production style from David Newfeld, who produced the second and third albums. In 2009, Stuart Berman's This Book Is Broken, which details the band from its inception to its critical acclaim, was published. In 2010, Bruce McDonald made This Movie Is Broken, a movie about the band's Harbourfront show during the 2009 Toronto strike."@en ;

Their style mixes elements of pop, ska, punk rock, folk, alternative country, and world music. The band initially polarized audiences within the hardcore punk scene of California's Inland Empire before finding wider acceptance and, eventually, an international audience. Their strong iconoclasm and emphasis on do-it-yourself values proved influential to the burgeoning indie rock movement. The band's first three independent records were released within an 18-month period. Their debut single was \"Take the Skinheads Bowling\". The group signed to Virgin Records in 1987, released two albums and enjoyed chart success with their 1989 cover of Status Quo's \"Pictures of Matchstick Men\", a number one hit on Billboard Magazine's Modern Rock Tracks. They disbanded the following year due to internal tensions. Lead singer David Lowery formed Cracker, David Immergl\u00FCck joined the Counting Crows, and several other members played in Monks of Doom. Beginning in 1999, the former members reunited and made several new records."@en ;

Following early line-ups with different guitarists and drummers, Liam \"Skin\" Tyson (guitar) and Keith O'Neill (drums) joined Cast in 1993. Emerging from the Britpop movement of the mid-1990s, Cast signed to Polydor Records and their debut album All Change (1995) became the highest selling debut album for the label. Further commercial success continued with the albums Mother Nature Calls (1997) and Magic Hour (1999), however a departure in sound on the band's fourth album Beetroot (2001) was met by a poor critical and commercial reaction and led to the band's split two weeks after its release. The band reformed in November 2010 and released their fifth album Troubled Times in November 2011. Bassist Peter Wilkinson confirmed his departure from the band in March 2015, following his abrupt departure from a previous tour in December 2014. Noel Gallagher of Oasis described watching the band live as being like a \"religious experience\" and they were labelled \"The Who of the 90's\". It has been suggested that the name \"Cast\" was taken from the final word on The La's eponymous album (the song \"Looking Glass\" ends with the repeated line \"The change is cast\"); John Power has since confirmed this to be true, stating that he avoided answering this question for some time."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Davenport (or The Davenport Family) was a musical collective from Madison, Wisconsin. The project was initiated by Clay Ruby in 2002. Their musical style, difficult to categorize, owes more to freeform jazz, psychedelic rock, and experimental avant-garde music than to traditional folk music, and may be loosely attributed to such genres as free folk, psych folk, freak-folk, acid folk, wyrd folk or New Weird America. The Davenport Family name existed actively until 2005. Presently, all original members participate in a similar band, which operates under the name Second Family Band. The recordings and performances typically include varying combinations of drums and other percussion, guitars, vocals, synthesizers, piano, organs, violins, flutes, electronics, sound sculpture, field recordings, more synths, sitar, sticks, rocks, and stones. Their music is almost always improvised, with a rare exception of overdubbing and other studio composed manipulations, especially in the early days of the group. The group is noted for usually shunning the recording studio, preferring field recording in locations such as barns, caves, or pastures. Consequently, environmental sounds such as dogs barking, birds singing, and other ambient noise may be heard on record."@en ;

It was formed in 1995 as a side project by In Flames' former guitarists Jesper Str\u00F6mblad and Glenn Ljungstr\u00F6m. The former Marduk drummer and vocalist Jocke Gothberg joined later on vocals, as well as Hans Nilsson (ex-Liers in Wait, Diabolique, Crystal Age) on drums. The band released Penetrations from the Lost World in 1997 before splitting up the following year. They reformed in 2000, and later recorded Silent Night Fever and This Is Hell. Tours have been rare due to members' other musical commitments. Musically, they have been described as strictly old-school Swedish death metal in the range of At the Gates, Unleashed and Defleshed. Because of Dimension Zero's inception by In Flames' lead guitarist, Jesper Str\u00F6mblad, their albums have drawn critical comparisons with some of In Flames' earlier work. Their latest album, He Who Shall Not Bleed, was released in 2007. In May 2014, it was announced that the band would reunite for the Gothenburg Sound Festival, which was set to take place in January 2015. In November 2014, a video message from vocalist Jocke on Gothenburg Sound's official Facobook page announced that Dimension Zero had been forced to cancel due to \"family circumstances\" and was replaced by Jesper Str\u00F6mblad's new band The Resistance. The band is slated to instead reunite for Gothenburg Sound 2016."@en ;

They subsequently dropped out of their studies to concentrate further on the band that would ultimately become Dream Theater. Though a number of lineup changes followed, the three original members remained together along with James LaBrie and Jordan Rudess until September 8, 2010 when Portnoy left the band. In October 2010, the band held auditions for a drummer to replace Portnoy. Mike Mangini was announced as the new permanent drummer on April 29, 2011. The band is well known for the technical proficiency of its instrumentalists, who have won many awards from music instruction magazines. Guitarist John Petrucci has been named as the third player on the G3 tour six times, more than any invited players. In 2009 he was named the No. 2 best metal guitarist by Joel McIver in his book The 100 Greatest Metal Guitarists. He was also named as one of the \"Top 10 Fastest Shredders of All Time\" by GuitarOne magazine. Jordan Rudess is considered to be one of the greatest keyboard players of all time by many publications like MusicRadar. Former drummer Mike Portnoy has won 26 awards from Modern Drummer magazine and is also the second youngest person (at the age of 37) to be inducted into the Rock Drummer Hall of Fame. His replacement Mike Mangini has also previously set 5 WFD records. John Myung was voted the greatest bassist of all time in a poll conducted by MusicRadar in August through September 2010. The band was inducted into the Long Island Music Hall of Fame in 2010. The band's highest-selling album is the gold-selling Images and Words (1992), which reached No. 61 on the Billboard 200 chart. Both the 1994 release Awake and their 2002 release Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence also entered the charts at No. 32 and No. 46 respectively and received mostly positive reviews. Metropolis Pt. 2: Scenes from a Memory was ranked number 95 on the October 2006 issue of Guitar World magazine's list of The greatest 100 guitar albums of all time. It is ranked as the 15th Greatest Concept Album (as of March 2003) by Classic Rock Magazine and as the number one all-time progressive album by Rolling Stone (as of July 2012). Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence also led to Dream Theater becoming the initial band reviewed in the music section of Entertainment Weekly during its opening week of release, despite the magazine generally preferring more mainstream music. The band's eleventh studio album, A Dramatic Turn of Events, was released on September 13, 2011. On November 30, 2011, the album's lead single, \"On the Backs of Angels\", was nominated for a Grammy Award in the \"Best Hard Rock/Metal Performance\" category, marking the band's first ever Grammy nomination. Dream Theater's self-titled twelfth studio album was released on September 23, 2013 and earned their second Grammy Award nomination, this time for \u201CBest Metal Performance\u201D, for the album's first single, \"The Enemy Inside\". On April 9, 2013, Images and Words won Loudwire's fan voted March Metal Madness for world's best metal album beating albums by Dio, AC/DC, Judas Priest, Megadeth and Metallica. As of 2011, Dream Theater has sold over 12 million records worldwide."@en ;

dbr:Foo_Fighters	rdf:type	dbo:Band ;
	dbo:abstract	"Foo Fighters is an American rock band, formed in Seattle in 1994. It was founded by Nirvana drummer Dave Grohl as a one-man project following the death of Kurt Cobain and the resulting dissolution of his previous band. The group got its name from the UFOs and various aerial phenomena that were reported by Allied aircraft pilots in World War II, which were known collectively as foo fighters. Prior to the release of Foo Fighters' 1995 debut album Foo Fighters, which featured Grohl as the only official member, Grohl recruited bassist Nate Mendel and drummer William Goldsmith, both formerly of Sunny Day Real Estate, as well as Nirvana touring guitarist Pat Smear to complete the lineup. The band began with performances in Portland, Oregon. Goldsmith quit during the recording of the group's second album, The Colour and the Shape (1997), when most of the drum parts were re-recorded by Grohl himself. Smear's departure followed soon afterward. They were replaced by Taylor Hawkins and Franz Stahl, respectively, although Stahl was fired before the recording of the group's third album, There Is Nothing Left to Lose (1999). The band briefly continued as a trio until Chris Shiflett joined as the band's lead guitarist after the completion of There Is Nothing Left to Lose. The band released its fourth album, One by One, in 2002. The group followed that release with the two-disc In Your Honor (2005), which was split between acoustic songs and heavier material. Foo Fighters released its sixth album, Echoes, Silence, Patience & Grace, in 2007. In 2010, it was confirmed that Smear had officially rejoined the band after having toured with Foo Fighters as an unofficial member since 2005. The band's seventh studio album, Wasting Light, produced by Butch Vig was released in 2011, in which Smear returned as a full member. In November 2014, the band's eighth studio album, Sonic Highways, was released as an accompanying soundtrack to the Grohl-directed 2014 miniseries of the same name. Over the course of the band's career, four of its albums have won Grammy Awards for Best Rock Album. As of 2015 the band's eight albums have sold 12 million copies in the U.S. alone."@en ;

The band's line-up comprises lead vocalist Matthew Davies-Kreye, guitarist Kris Coombs-Roberts, guitarist Gavin Burrough and bassist Richard Boucher. Funeral for a Friend's popularity rose in the United Kingdom with the release of their debut album, Casually Dressed & Deep in Conversation (2003). Achieving both a gold certification and three top twenty singles in their home country, Casually Dressed & Deep in Conversation is often acclaimed as one of the landmark emo records of the 2000s. Hours (2005) and Tales Don't Tell Themselves (2007) showed an evolution in Funeral for a Friend's musical style from the style which defined their debut, as the group began to diverge from their use of screaming vocals, post-hardcore influenced guitars, favouring more melodic emo influences. These albums achieved gold and silver sales certificates respectively in the UK. Funeral for a Friend self-released their fourth album, Memory and Humanity (2008) through their short-lived record label Join Us, the album arguably being their most eclectic to date. Following this the band tied themselves to other independent labels for Welcome Home Armageddon (2011) Conduit (2013), and Chapter and Verse (2015), which showed the band returning to the metal and hardcore influenced style of their earlier work. In September 2015 they announced that they will do a final tour and break up in 2016."@en ;

The band originally called themselves Hoover, but later changed their name to Hooverphonic after discovering other groups were already using the Hoover name and to avoid any legal issues with the vacuum cleaner company. On 10 October 2008, Geike Arnaert, the lead singer of the band, announced she would leave the group by the end of the year to pursue her solo career. Arnaert had been working on solo material for a few months. The last concert of Hooverphonic with Geike was on 13 December 2008 in Tele-Club, Ekaterinburg, Russia. It was filmed by the local MTV station and was shown on Russian TV in 2009. On 29 October 2010, Hooverphonic announced their new single on their website. The videoclip showcased fourteen possible singers but only one of them, No\u00E9mie Wolfs, proved to be the real successor of Geike Arnaert.

Initially known in Australia for their pub rock style, they later achieved mainstream success playing new wave and synthpop music and attained Top 10 singles chart success in both Europe and the U.S. The mainstay of both Flowers and Icehouse has been Iva Davies (singer-songwriter, record producer, guitar, bass, keyboards, oboe) supplying additional musicians as required. The name Icehouse, which was adopted in 1981, comes from an old, cold flat Davies lived in and the strange building across the road populated by itinerant people. Davies and Icehouse extended the use of synthesizers particularly the Sequential Circuits Prophet-5 (\"Love in Motion\", 1981), Linn drum machine (\"Hey Little Girl\", 1982) and Fairlight CMI (Razorback trailer, 1983) in Australian popular music. Their best known singles on the Australian charts were \"Great Southern Land\", \"Hey Little Girl\", \"Crazy\", \"Electric Blue\" and \"My Obsession\"; with Top Three albums being Icehouse (1980, as Flowers), Primitive Man (1982) and Man of Colours (1987). Icehouse's iconic status was acknowledged when they were inducted into the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) Hall of Fame on 16 August 2006. ARIA described Icehouse as \"one of the most successful Australian bands of the eighties and nineties... With an uncompromising approach to music production they created songs that ranged from pure pop escapism to edgy, lavish synthesised pieces...\" Icehouse has produced eight Top Ten albums and twenty Top Forty singles in Australia, multiple top ten hits in Europe and North America and album sales of over 28 times Platinum in Australasia alone. As of 2006, Man of Colours was still the highest selling album in Australia by an Australian band."@en ;

Created by Jade 4U, Praga Khan and Olivier Adams; their debut album, 1991's Lust (along with additional singles \"Rough Sex\" and \"I Must Increase My Bust\"), were critically acclaimed within the electronic music and dance music communities for their outrageously sexual lyrics and sound samples. Their second album was Voodoo-U (1994), which featured a more industrial sound. This was followed by Our Little Secret (1997), Heaven Is an Orgasm (1998) and Expand Your Head (1999). In 2000 they released a more rock-influenced album titled Farstucker and in 2003, after being in the business for fifteen years, released a greatest hits album called Greatest T*ts. Their fans formed an online community called the Children of Acid. In 2010, after almost ten years without a release, Praga Khan announced a new EP, Little Mighty Rabbit, was in the works with a September 2011 release date. Their latest album Deep Chills was released on 10 April 2012. Tracks on the album included \"Children of Acid\", \"Paranormal Energy\" with Zak Bagans, and \"Pop That Tooshie\" with Alana Evans.

	dbo:abstract	"Machine Head is an American heavy metal band from Oakland, California. Formed on October 12, 1991, the group was founded by vocalist and guitarist Robb Flynn and bassist Adam Duce. The current lineup of the band comprises Flynn, drummer Dave McClain, guitarist Phil Demmel, and bassist Jared MacEachern. Machine Head is one of the pioneering bands in the New Wave of American Heavy Metal. Machine Head was formed by member Robb Flynn, previously part of the bands Forbidden and Vio-lence. Flynn felt musically unfulfilled with Vio-lence and requested to start a side project. When his request was denied, he left the band and formed Machine Head in 1991 with Adam Duce, Logan Mader and Tony Constanza. The band's first album Burn My Eyes, was a big success in Europe where it garnered attention on MTV's Headbangers Ball. In America (with HBB taken off the air during the grunge movement) Machine Head would not have success until later albums. The band nearly disbanded in 2002 after negotiating off its label Roadrunner Records, when controversy surrounding Machine Head's fourth album Supercharger (released 3 weeks after September 11, 2001) resulted in their songs and music video for the song \"Crashing Around You\" (which featured burning buildings) being pulled from all media outlets. The band re-signed with Roadrunner soon after and has released four albums since, 2003's Through the Ashes of Empires, 2007's The Blackening (which earned Machine Head its first Grammy Award nomination) and 2011's Unto the Locust. Their most recent album, Bloodstone & Diamonds, was released in 2014. Machine Head have sold over 3 million records worldwide."@en ;

They are often colloquially known as \"The Manics.\" After the release of their first single, \"Suicide Alley\", Richey Edwards joined the band as co-lyricist and rhythm guitarist. The band proclaimed their debut album Generation Terrorists would be the \"greatest rock album ever\" and hoped to sell sixteen million copies around the world, \"from Bangkok to Senegal\", after which they would split up. Despite the album's failure to meet this level of success, the band carried on with their career. The group later became a trio when Edwards disappeared on 1 February 1995. Bradfield, Moore and Wire went on to gain critical and commercial success. The band have released twelve albums and three compilations, Forever Delayed, Lipstick Traces (A Secret History of Manic Street Preachers) and National Treasures \u2013 The Complete Singles. Their early combination of androgynous glam imagery, critical social lyrics about \"culture, alienation, boredom and despair\" and a furious rock sound gained them a loyal following over the years and assured them a cult status. The band's later albums retained a leftist politicisation and intellectual lyrical style while adopting a broader alternative rock sound. To date, they have sold more than 10 million albums worldwide. Over their career the Manics have headlined several festivals including Glastonbury, T in the Park, V Festival and Reading. They have won eleven NME Awards, eight Q Awards and four BRIT Awards. The Manics were also nominated for the Mercury Prize in 1996 and 1999, and have had one nomination for the MTV Europe Music Awards. The group has reached number 1 in the UK charts three times: in 1998 with the album This Is My Truth Tell Me Yours, and the single \"If You Tolerate This Your Children Will Be Next\" and again in 2000 with the single \"The Masses Against the Classes\"."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Master is a death metal band formed in Chicago, USA in 1983 as the band Warcry fell apart. However, the band was put on hold due to internal problems shortly after its inception. Paul Speckmann then formed the band Death Strike, which in 1985 he renamed to Master. In 1985 Master obtained a record deal with Combat Records and recorded an album, which was not released until 2003 by Displeased Records as Unreleased 1985 album. In 1990 the band was signed by the German label Nuclear Blast Records, who also had contracted Speckmann's other band Abomination. The actual debut album of Master, titled simply Master, was recorded twice; first with Mittelbrun on guitars and Schmidt on drums. This recording was not accepted by the record company Nuclear Blast. Hence it was re-recorded with Nickeas (drums) and Martinelli (guitar), which was eventually released as the Speckmann Project in 1991. The first recording was released under the name Master in 1990. In 1991, the second album was released: On the Seventh Day God Created ... Master, featuring Paul Masvidal on lead guitar, followed by the Collection of Souls in 1993 both on Nuclear Blast. Thereafter their record deal ended and Master went on hiatus to find a new record label. Five years layer, Faith Is in Season was released on Pavement Music. Speckmann then focused on several other projects, including the resurrected Abomination and eventually joined the Czech band Krabathor, for which Speckmann relocated to the Czech Republic. In 2002 the next album was released, titled Let's Start a War on System Shock, which also contracted Krabathor. In 2004 Spirit of the West followed. Master then switched labels again, to the German label Twilight Vertrieb and released Four More Years of Terror in 2005. The album Slaves to Society was released in May 2007. The band embarked on a European tour in May and June 2007, followed by yet another tour with Chicago legend Lividity beginning on September 8, 2007 until September 30, 2007. Slaves to Society has been re-released on Ibex Moon Records in Pennsylvania in September 2008. The spring of 2009 found the band touring successfully for 38 days playing 30 shows across the European continent. The US version of Master toured in July 2009 for 21 shows in America."@en ;

The band achieved success during the early 1990s with their double platinum debut album After the Rain, which featured the number-one hit \"(Can't Live Without Your) Love and Affection\". After the success of their first album, the band claims to have been faced with conflicts with their record label, lack of support from the media, and the shift in music towards grunge and alternative rock. They eventually split with Geffen Records in 1995. Despite this, the band has continued to produce and release albums independently under their own label, Stone Canyon Records. Matthew and Gunnar also perform under the name of Ricky Nelson Remembered, as a tribute to their father. They are listed in the Guinness Book of World Records as the only family to reach number one record status in three successive generations (beginning with grandparents Ozzie and Harriet Nelson)."@en ;

dbr:New_Edition	rdf:type	dbo:Band ;
	dbo:abstract	"New Edition is an American R&B boy band formed in Boston in 1978. The group reached its height of popularity during the 1980s. They were the progenitors of the boy band movement of the 1980s and 1990s and led the way for groups like New Kids on the Block (also formed in the Boston area), The Boys, Boyz II Men, Hi-Five, Backstreet Boys and NSYNC. The group recorded mostly as a quintet. During the group's first bout of fame in 1983, its members were Ricky Bell, Michael Bivins, Bobby Brown, Ronnie DeVoe, and Ralph Tresvant. Early hits included \"Candy Girl,\" \"Cool It Now\" and \"Mr. Telephone Man\". Brown was voted out of the group in 1985 and embarked on a solo career. The group continued for a time with its remaining four members, but eventually recruited singer Johnny Gill, who would be introduced on their 1988 album Heart Break. The group went on hiatus in 1990, while its various members worked on side projects, such as the group Bell Biv DeVoe. Gill and Tresvant also recorded successful solo albums. All six members of New Edition reunited in 1996 to record the group's sixth studio album Home Again. During the ill-fated Home Again Tour, both Bobby Brown and Michael Bivins eventually quit the group, forcing the remainder of the tour to be canceled. Various reunions have occurred since, usually with the 1987-1990 lineup, though occasionally also including Brown. Their last studio album was 2004's One Love. As of 2010, two New Edition descendants were recording and touring: Bell Biv DeVoe and Heads of State (which features Brown, Tresvant and Gill.) On May 3, 2011 New Edition issued a press release on their official website announcing that all six members were reuniting as New Edition to kick off the 30th anniversary celebration of \"Candy Girl\" with their fans."@en ;

dbr:Orchestral_Manoeuvres_in_the_Dark	rdf:type	dbo:Band ;
	dbo:abstract	"Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark (OMD) are an English new wave/synthpop group formed in 1978, whose founding members, Andy McCluskey (vocals, bass guitar) and Paul Humphreys (keyboards, vocals), are originally from the Wirral Peninsula, Merseyside, England. While steadily eschewing pop star status, the band cultivated a fanbase in the United Kingdom from 1978\u20131980. They gained popularity throughout Europe with the 1980 single \"Enola Gay\", and achieved broader recognition via album Architecture & Morality (1981) and its singles. OMD garnered acclaim for their experimental recordings, which are noted for their intellectual depth. Although retrospectively lauded, the challenging Dazzle Ships (1983) eroded European consumer interest during the mid 1980s; Junk Culture (1984) marked a shift toward more pop-oriented songwriting. Concurrently, OMD reached their peak in the United States and had a major hit with 1986's \"If You Leave\", written for the film Pretty in Pink. Humphreys departed in 1989 with Martin Cooper (various instruments) and Malcolm Holmes (drums) to form The Listening Pool, leaving McCluskey to lead the outfit; Sugar Tax (1991) and its initial singles were sizeable hits in Europe. By the mid 1990s, however, synthpop had become unfashionable amid the guitar oriented musical climate, and McCluskey dissolved the band in 1996, months after their last successful single, \"Walking on the Milky Way\". He founded pop group Atomic Kitten in 1998. The band reformed in 2006 and began releasing new material in 2009. Their European fanbase remained steadfast: History of Modern (2010) became the group's biggest hit on the German chart; English Electric (2013) their largest in the UK since Sugar Tax. The group have sold over 40 million records. With a within popular music, OMD have influenced many modern acts. Their songs have been covered or remixed by numerous artists, and the group are the subject of two tribute albums. Regarding the group's impact on synthpop, The Scotsman wrote that \"Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark were its Beatles\"; McCluskey and Humphreys have been labelled by numerous critics as the genre's counterpart of Lennon\u2013McCartney."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Porcupine Tree are an English rock band formed by musician Steven Wilson in 1987. The band began essentially as a solo project for Wilson, who created all of the band's music. However, by 1993, Wilson desired to work in a band environment, and so brought on frequent collaborators Richard Barbieri on keyboards, Colin Edwin on bass and Chris Maitland on drums as permanent band members. With Wilson still in charge of guitar and lead vocals, this would remain the lineup until 2001, when the band recruited Gavin Harrison to replace Maitland on drums. Porcupine Tree's early sound evokes a style of psychedelic rock comparable to that of progressive rock band Pink Floyd. Upon signing with Kscope record label in the late 1990s, the band approached a more mainstream alternative rock sound. By the early 2000s, the band signed to a major record label and shifted their sound again, this time in a more progressive metal direction. After the release and tour in support of their tenth studio album, The Incident, the band became inactive as Wilson began to focus on his solo career. While not formally broken up, they also have no particular reformation plans beyond \"someday\", with members all working on separate projects, and Wilson committing himself to his solo work through most of 2015."@en ;

Despite their pop-oriented nature, the trio maintains a distinctly underground garage rock sound rooted in edgy instrumentation and D.I.Y. aesthetics, which over the course of their long career has earned them a solid, worldwide cult following and made avid fans out of seminal '90s alternative rock bands such as Sonic Youth, Nirvana, and Redd Kross.

	dbo:abstract	"Slaughter is an American hard rock band formed in Las Vegas, Nevada by lead vocalist/rhythm guitarist Mark Slaughter and bassist Dana Strum. The band reached stardom in 1990 with their first album Stick It to Ya, which spawned several hit singles including \"Up All Night\", \"Spend My Life\", \"Mad About You\" and \"Fly to the Angels\". The album reached double platinum status in the United States. The band remains a steady act in national tours, mainly in the Rock Never Stops Tour which features several bands of the same era. Slaughter formed in Las Vegas, Nevada, in late-1988, out of the ashes of lead vocalist Mark Slaughter and bassist Dana Strum's previous band, Vinnie Vincent Invasion. Vinnie Vincent Invasion's record company, Chrysalis Records, took the $4 million contract away from Vinnie Vincent for overexceeding his credit line with the label, and transferred the contract to former members Slaughter and Strum. By 1989, Slaughter and Strum completed the lineup by recruiting lead guitarist Tim Kelly and drummer Blas Elias."@en ;

The band was initially formed by four college students\u2014Bilal Maqsood (vocals and guitars), Faisal Kapadia (vocals), Rafiq Wazir Ali (synthesizer) and Kareem Bashir Bhoy (bass guitar)\u2014in 1988. In 1992 the quartet disbanded, only to make a comeback with Maqsood and Kapadia in 2000. While the initial band rode the new wave of Pakistani pop music, the later lineup ushered in a revival in the Pakistani music industry. In 1990 the band signed with EMI Records and released their debut album, Strings. Their initial experiments with synthesised sounds and rhythms was not immediately recognised, although Strings sold 20,000 copies during its first week after release. Two years later the band released their second album, 2, which included the critically acclaimed single \"Sar Kiye Yeh Pahar\". The song was first aired on MTV Asia, and led the band to widespread fame. After the release of 2, the quartet disbanded to focus on their studies and careers. In 2000 Maqsood and Kapadia released Duur, which revived the band's popularity, and followed it with Dhaani in 2003. This album included the single \"Najane Kyun\", which was part of the soundtrack for the Hollywood film Spider-Man 2. Following Junoon and Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan, Strings went to India (where they found remixes of one of their early songs playing in clubs). In 2008 Strings released their fifth album, Koi Aanay Wala Hai, with the singles \"Zinda\" and \"Aakhri Alvida\" (included on the soundtracks for Bollywood's Zinda and Shootout at Lokhandwala). The album was co-produced by Bollywood actor John Abraham, and was successful in Pakistan and India. Strings are acclaimed for their stringed rhythms and melodious, poetic songs written by Anwar Maqsood, Bilal's father. He has been writing lyrics for the band since its re-formation, with Kapadia the lead vocalist. Bilal Maqsood composes, plays guitar and occasionally sings. Strings' live performances are augmented by Adeel Ali on lead guitar, Shakir Khan on bass guitar, Haider Ali on keyboards and Aahad Nayani on drums. The band have sold over 25 million albums worldwide. In April 2013 Strings joined Meesha Shafi, Ali Azmat, Shahzad Hasan and Alamgir as judges on the vocal-talent show Cornetto Music Icons, aired on ARY Digital. Strings is also the director and producer of the Coke Studio Pakistan (Season 7) and Coke Studio Pakistan (Season 8)"@en ;

The band is often credited (along with D.R.I.) as one of \"the fathers of crossover thrash\". To date, Suicidal Tendencies have released nine studio albums, one EP, four split albums including the rare Welcome to Venice, six compilation albums (one of which is a \"double-EP\", while the other is a re-recording of their debut album), and two long-form videos. Suicidal Tendencies rose to fame with their 1983 self-titled debut album, which spawned the single \"Institutionalized\", and was one of the first hardcore punk videos to receive substantial airplay on MTV. Suicidal Tendencies' next release was on their own label, Suicidal Records, where they contributed one song, \"Look Up...(The Boys Are Back)\", on the 1985 split Welcome to Venice. After releasing their second album Join the Army (1987), Suicidal Tendencies were signed to Epic Records in 1988, and continued their success with their next three albums, How Will I Laugh Tomorrow When I Can't Even Smile Today (1988), Controlled by Hatred/Feel Like Shit...D\u00E9j\u00E0 Vu (1989) and Lights...Camera...Revolution! (1990); the latter of the two were certified Gold by the RIAA. Their 1992 follow-up album The Art of Rebellion was also very successful, and included two of their biggest hits \"Nobody Hears\" and \"I'll Hate You Better\". After releasing two more studio albums (Still Cyco After All These Years and Suicidal for Life), the band broke up and severed ties from Sony and Epic in 1995. However, they reunited a year later and have continued to perform and record since then. After over a decade of work and many lineup changes, Suicidal Tendencies released their eleventh studio album with all-new material, 13, in 2013. The band has been in talks of releasing a follow-up album in the future."@en ;

The duo was managed by Russian television producer Ivan Shapovalov while in the group Neposedi. The duo was signed to their own production company, T.A. Music, following the split with Universal Music Russia, and their sub-labels Interscope Records and Neformat. The duo established their success with their debut single \"All the Things She Said\", which gained acclaim from music journalists and critics. The video of the single, however, generated controversy worldwide, showing the girls kissing in the rain in school uniforms. Along with the number-one single, the following songs \"Not Gonna Get Us\" and \"All About Us\" gained success and also charted at No. 1 on other contemporary music charts. The duo has released six studio albums; three in Russian and three in English. The album 200 km/h in the Wrong Lane achieved huge success worldwide and eventually became the first group ever to get the IFPI Europe platinum award for the same album in two different languages. Due to their success, the duo was recognized as one of the most successful female music acts to emerge in the early decade and have established themselves as the most successful Russian act to date. t.A.T.u. represented Russia in the 2003 Eurovision Song Contest, performing \"Ne Ver', Ne Boysia\", finishing in third place.

The band has released three studio albums with various past members Fred Mascherino (former lead guitarist and back-up vocalist), Matthew Rubano (former bassist), and Matthew Fazzi (former lead guitarist and back-up vocalist). The original Tell All Your Friends line-up reunited in 2010 and has released two studio albums: Taking Back Sunday and their most recent album Happiness Is. Louder Now (2006) was the band's breakout mainstream album, notably because of the popularity of its lead single \"MakeDamnSure.\" The album has sold over 900,000 copies and peaked at No. 2 on the United States Billboard 200, surpassing the band's previous Billboard 200 peak in 2004 at No. 3 with Where You Want to Be. Before the release of their first studio album Tell All Your Friends (2002), they released Taking Back Sunday's EP in 2001, when the band featured former lead vocalist Antonio Longo. At that time, the EP received very little attention, eventually resulting in the band seeking a new lead singer, Adam Lazzara. Lazzara had at first joined the band as its guitarist, left a few months after it formed, then replaced original bassist Jesse Lacey (now of Brand New) during the EP's recording sessions. John Nolan and Shaun Cooper left the band in 2003 only to rejoin in 2010, in time for the band's release of their eponymous album Taking Back Sunday on June 28, 2011. The album was produced by Eric Valentine and released through Warner Bros. Records. In 2014, the band released their sixth studio album Happiness Is to positive reviews.

dbr:The_Blues_Brothers	rdf:type	dbo:Band ;
	dbo:abstract	"The Blues Brothers, formally, variously The Blues Brothers' Show Band and Revue and The Blues Brothers' Rhythm and Blues Revue, are an American blues and rhythm and blues revivalist band founded in 1976 by comedy actors Dan Aykroyd and John Belushi as part of a musical sketch on Saturday Night Live. Belushi and Aykroyd, in character as lead vocalist \"Joliet\" Jake Blues (named after Joliet Prison) and harmonica player/backing vocalist Elwood Blues (named after the Elwood Ordnance Plant, which made TNT and grenades during World War II), fronted the band, which was composed of well-known and respected musicians. The Blues Brothers first appeared on Saturday Night Live on January 17, 1976. The band made its second appearance as the musical guest on the April 22, 1978 episode of Saturday Night Live. They made their third and final appearance on November 18, 1978. The band began to take on a life beyond television, releasing an album, Briefcase Full of Blues, in 1978, and then having a Hollywood film, The Blues Brothers, created around its characters in 1980. Since the death of Belushi in 1982, the Blues Brothers have continued to perform with a rotating cast of guest singers and musicians. They reformed in 1988 for a world tour and in 1998 for a sequel film, Blues Brothers 2000. They make regular appearances at musical festivals worldwide. On August 31, 2011, it was announced that Aykroyd and Belushi's widow, Judith Belushi Pisano, were pitching a new Blues Brothers TV series to primetime networks."@en ;

dbr:The_Chieftains	rdf:type	dbo:Band ;
	dbo:abstract	"The Chieftains are a traditional Irish band formed in Dublin in November 1962, by Paddy Moloney, Sean Potts and Michael Tubridy. The band had their first rehearsals at Moloney's house, with Tubridy, Martin Fay and David Fallon. Their sound, which is almost entirely instrumental and largely built around uilleann pipes, has become synonymous with traditional Irish music and they are regarded as having helped popularise Irish music across the world. Paddy Moloney came out of Ceolt\u00F3ir\u00ED Chualann, a group of musicians who specialised in instrumentals, and sought to form a new band. The group remained only semi-professional up until the 1970s and by then had achieved great success in Ireland and the United Kingdom. In 1973, their popularity began to spread to the United States when their previous albums were released there by Island Records. They received further acclaim when they worked on the Academy Award-winning soundtrack to Stanley Kubrick's 1975 film Barry Lyndon, which triggered their transition to the mainstream in the US. The group continued to release successful records throughout the 1970s and 1980s, and their work with Van Morrison in 1988 resulted in the critically acclaimed album Irish Heartbeat. They went on to collaborate with many other well-known musicians and singers; among them Luciano Pavarotti, the Rolling Stones, Madonna, Sin\u00E9ad O'Connor and Roger Daltrey. The band have won six Grammys during their career and they were given a Lifetime Achievement Award at the prestigious BBC Radio 2 Folk Awards in 2002. Some music experts have credited The Chieftains with bringing traditional Irish music to a worldwide audience, so much so that the Irish government awarded them the honorary title of 'Ireland's Musical Ambassadors' in 1989. In 2012, they celebrated their 50th anniversary with the release of their most recent record Voice of Ages."@en ;

dbr:The_Flaming_Lips	rdf:type	dbo:Band ;
	dbo:abstract	"The Flaming Lips is an American rock band formed in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, in 1983. Instrumentally, their sound contains lush, multi-layered, psychedelic rock arrangements, but lyrically their compositions show elements of space rock, including unusual song and album titles\u2014such as \"What Is the Light? (An Untested Hypothesis Suggesting That the Chemical [In Our Brains] by Which We Are Able to Experience the Sensation of Being in Love Is the Same Chemical That Caused the \"Big Bang\" That Was the Birth of the Accelerating Universe)\". They are also acclaimed for their elaborate live shows, which feature costumes, balloons, puppets, video projections, complex stage light configurations, giant hands, large amounts of confetti, and frontman Wayne Coyne's signature man-sized plastic bubble, in which he traverses the audience. In 2002, Q magazine named the Flaming Lips one of the \"50 Bands to See Before You Die.\" The band is best known for its associations with 1960s and 1970s psychedelic subculture, with elements of this culture permeating the group's instrumentation, effects, and composition. Coyne's lyrics, in particular, both reference and embody the fascination with the science fiction and space opera genres of fiction that were popular during the golden age of psychedelic subculture. His lyrical style tends to use the imagery and plot conventions of space opera to frame more abstract themes about the unfolding cycles of romantic love, highlighting its vulnerability while delving into its metaphysical implications. The group recorded several albums and EPs on an indie label, Restless, in the 1980s and early 1990s. After signing to Warner Brothers, they scored a hit in 1993 with \"She Don't Use Jelly\". Although it has been their only hit single in the U.S., the band has maintained critical respect and, to a lesser extent, commercial viability through albums such as 1999's The Soft Bulletin (which was NME magazine's Album of the Year) and 2002's Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots. They have had more hit singles in the UK and Europe than in the U.S. In February 2007, they were nominated for a 2007 BRIT Award in the \"Best International Act\" category. By 2007, the group garnered three Grammy Awards, including two for Best Rock Instrumental Performance."@en ;

The band currently consists of Luke Pritchard (vocals/guitar), Hugh Harris (lead guitar/synth), Alexis Nunez (drums), and Peter Denton (bass guitar). The original bassist was Max Rafferty. The lineup of the band remained constant until the departure of Rafferty in 2008. Dan Logan served as a temporary replacement, until Peter Denton joined the band permanently in October 2008. Early in 2010, Pritchard announced the departure of drummer Paul Garred, due to a nerve problem in his arm. Late in the year, Garred rejoined for studio sessions, however Chris Prendergast played drums when the band played live. In 2012, the band was accompanied on drums by Alexis Nunez (from Golden Silvers), who eventually joined the band full-time. A self-described \"pop\" band, their music is primarily influenced by the 1960s British Invasion movement and post-punk revival of the new millennium. With songs described as \"catchy as hell\", The Kooks have experimented in several genres including rock, Britpop, pop, reggae, ska, and more recently, funk and hip-hop, being described once as a \"more energetic Thrills or a looser Sam Roberts Band, maybe even a less severe Arctic Monkeys at times\". Signed to Virgin Records just three months after forming, The Kooks broke into the musical mainstream with their debut album Inside In/Inside Out (2006). The album was ultimately successful, achieving quadruple platinum status in the UK within a year and also overseas in the form of a platinum certification in Australia and two times platinum in Ireland. The Kooks found themselves entering into mainstream media attention, with the band winning the award for Best UK & Ireland Act at the MTV Europe Music Awards 2006 and picking up a nomination at The Brit Awards for the single \"She Moves in Her Own Way\". With their follow-up Konk (2008) debuting at number one on the UK Albums Chart, it recorded first week sales of 65,000, achieving gold status in both the UK and Ireland. Their third studio album, entitled Junk of the Heart, was released on 12 September 2011. Their most recent album was released on 8 September 2014 and debuted at No. 16 on the UK Albums Chart."@en ;

The band released Out of the Vein in 2003 and Ursa Major in 2009, with only Jenkins and Hargreaves as the remaining core members. The band's current iteration, including Kryz Reid (lead guitar), Alex Kopp (keyboards), and Alex LeCavalier (bass guitar), recorded the band's fifth studio album, Dopamine, which was released in 2015. The band found commercial success in the late 1990s, with Third Eye Blind and Blue going six times and single platinum in the United States respectively. Several songs were a commercial success as well, with \"Semi-Charmed Life,\" \"Jumper,\" and \"How's It Going to Be,\" all reaching the Top 10 of the US Billboard Hot 100, and \"Never Let You Go\" reaching the Top 20.

	dbo:abstract	"Thompson is a Croatian rock band, founded by Marko Perkovi\u0107 aka \"Thompson\", often identified with the band itself. \"Thompson\" is Perkovi\u0107's stage name. He is the songwriter and lead vocalist. The lineup consists of: Tiho Orli\u0107, Ivan Ivankovi\u0107, Duje Ivi\u0107, and Ivica Bili\u0107 Ike. The band name originates from the Thompson submachine gun, a nickname given to Perkovi\u0107 while he fought in the Croatian War of Independence. Although predominantly formed in \u010Cavoglave, Thompson is currently based in Zagreb. Thompson came to prominence during the Croatian war in 1991, with the release of the first single \"Bojna \u010Cavoglave\", which proclaims the Croatian resistance to Yugoslavia and was included in the compilation album Rock za Hrvatsku. This song, with slightly modified lyrics, named \"Branitelji Sarajeva\", was sung by the BiH Army during the Siege of Sarajevo (Sarajevo zaboravit ne \u0107e nikada). During the 1990s Thompson gained popularity in Croatia with the release of the first album Moli mala in 1992. They later regained popularity with the popular hit \"Prijatelji\" in 1998.[citation needed] In 2002, Thompson began their first major tour to promote the album E, moj narode. This tour continued sporadically until 2005, and included concerts at the Sydney Entertainment Centre and Melbourne's Vodafone Arena. In May 2005, the album was declared a Diamond Record with more than 60,000 copies sold. Touring continued in 2006 with Bilo jednom u Hrvatskoj, again performing internationally with concerts in Germany, Sweden, Australia, Canada, and the United States. Thompson features annually at the Homeland Victory celebrations in their hometown of \u010Cavoglave. These performances are attended by as many as 60,000 to 100,000 spectators, and feature Croatian singers like Mate Buli\u0107, Dra\u017Een Ze\u010Di\u0107, Ivan Mikuli\u0107, and Baruni. The band's concert in the Netherlands was banned in 2003."@en ;

Unlike most other bands under Johnny & Associates, where all of the band members are usually only vocalists, Tokio only has one main vocalist, a drummer, a guitarist, a bassist, and a keyboardist. Subsequently, less choreography is used in concerts and promotional videos, and their music is often more rock-centric."@en ;

In 1976, Daevid Allen departed from the band, which released the album Shamal without him, and then released a series of jazz rock albums under the leadership of Pierre Moerlen. This incarnation of the band is known as Pierre Moerlen's Gong, and Gong member Gilli Smyth formed Mother Gong. Allen subsequently participated in a series of spin-off groups, including New York Gong and Gongmaison, before returning to lead Gong in 1991, releasing the albums Shapeshifter, Zero to Infinity, Acid Motherhood, 2032 and I See You before Allen's death in 2015."@en ;

Supporting members include Dimetres Collins (keyboards, guitar), and Andrew Perusi (bass) who have toured and performed live with the band since 2007. They are best known for the 1997 hit song \"MMMBop\" from their major label debut album Middle of Nowhere, which earned three Grammy nominations. Despite the enormous commercial success of Middle of Nowhere, the band suffered from the merger that eliminated their label, Mercury Records. The group was moved to Island Def Jam Music Group, which they eventually left after a conflict with the label. Hanson has sold over 16 million records worldwide and have had 8 top 40 albums and 6 top 40 singles in the US, as well as 8 top 40 singles in the UK.

The group's personnel has changed frequently over the years; Lydon has been the sole constant member. Lydon emerged after the break-up of the Sex Pistols with PiL's Public Image: First Issue (1978). The new band had a more experimental sound than the Pistols: a \"droning, slow-tempo, bass-heavy noise rock, overlaid by Lydon's distinctive, vituperative rant\". Their early work is often regarded as some of the most challenging and innovative music of the post-punk era. Their 1979 album Metal Box was ranked number 469 on Rolling Stone magazine's 2003 list of the 500 greatest albums of all time. The NME described PiL as \"arguably the first post-rock group\"."@en ;

The band currently consists of longstanding members Alan Morse, Dave Meros, and Ryo Okumoto, along with newer members drummer Jimmy Keegan and vocalist Ted Leonard; both of whom had performed in a live capacity with the band previously (Keegan from D'Virgilio's switch to frontman and Leonard in the immediate aftermath of D'Virgilio's departure). The band plays a brand of progressive rock with pop music leanings (drawing much influence from Yes and Genesis). The band is also well known for their intricate multi-part vocal harmonies (such as those found on certain Gentle Giant songs) and use of counterpoint on cuts such as \"Gibberish\", \"Thoughts (Parts I and II)\", \"A Guy Named Sid Pt.5: Sid's Boy Choir\", \"Long Time Suffering\", \"Devil's Got My Throat\", \"The Healing Colors of Sound, Pt. 2\", and \"Afterthoughts.\""@en ;

dbr:Stereolab	rdf:type	dbo:Band ;
	dbo:abstract	"Stereolab are an alternative music band formed in 1990 in London, England. The band originally comprised songwriting team Tim Gane (guitar/keyboards) and L\u00E6titia Sadier (vocals/keyboards/guitar), both of whom remained at the helm across many lineup changes. Other long-time members include Mary Hansen (backing vocals/keyboards/guitar), who played with the group from 1992 until her accidental death in 2002, and Andy Ramsay (drums), who joined in 1993, and who is still in the official line-up. Called \"one of the most fiercely independent and original groups of the Nineties\", Stereolab were one of the first bands to be termed \"post-rock\". Their primary musical influence was 1970s krautrock, which they combined with lounge, 1960s pop, and experimental pop music. They were noted for their heavy use of vintage electronic keyboards, and their sound often overlays a repetitive \"motorik\" beat with female vocals sung in English or French. Stereolab often incorporates socio-political themes into their lyrics. Some critics say the group's lyrics carry a strong Marxist message, and both Gane and Sadier admit to being influenced by the Surrealist and Situationist cultural and political movements. Gane is skeptical of labels such as \"Marxist pop\", and defends the band against accusations of \"sloganeering\". Although many of the band's albums have been underground hits, they never found larger commercial success. The band were released from their recording contract with Warner Bros. Records when Warner's imprint Elektra Records folded. The release was reportedly due to poor record sales, and since then Stereolab's self-owned label, Duophonic Records, has signed a distribution deal with Too Pure. Duophonic holds the copyrights to the band's recordings, and on this label the band has released many limited-edition records. In 2009, Stereolab announced via their website that they were going on indefinite hiatus."@en ;

dbr:The_Quarrymen	rdf:type	dbo:Band ;
	dbo:abstract	"The Quarrymen (also written as \"the Quarry Men\") are a British skiffle/rock and roll group, formed by John Lennon in Liverpool in 1956, which eventually evolved into the Beatles in 1960. Originally consisting of Lennon and several schoolfriends, the Quarrymen took their name from a line in the school song of Quarry Bank High School, which they attended. Lennon's mother, Julia Lennon, taught her son to play the banjo and then showed Lennon and Eric Griffiths how to tune their guitars in a similar way to the banjo, and taught them simple chords and songs. Lennon started a skiffle group that was very briefly called the Blackjacks, but changed the name before any public performances. Some accounts credit Lennon with choosing the new name; other accounts credit his close friend Pete Shotton with suggesting the name. The Quarrymen played at parties, school dances, cinemas and amateur skiffle contests before Paul McCartney joined the band in October 1957. George Harrison joined the band in early 1958 at McCartney's recommendation, though Lennon initially resisted because he felt Harrison (still 14 when he was first introduced to Lennon) to be too young. Both McCartney and Harrison attended the Liverpool Institute. The group made an amateur recording of themselves in 1958, performing Buddy Holly's \"That'll Be the Day\" and \"In Spite of All the Danger\", a song written by McCartney and Harrison. The group moved away from skiffle and towards rock and roll, causing several of the original members to leave. This left only a trio of Lennon, McCartney, and Harrison, who performed under several other names, including Johnny and the Moondogs and Japage 3 before returning to the Quarrymen name in 1959. In 1960, the group changed its name to the Beatles, and went on to have an extremely successful recording career. In 1997 the four surviving original members of the Quarrymen reunited to perform at the 40th anniversary celebrations of the garden fete performance at which Lennon and McCartney met for the first time. The band decided to continue playing, and since 1998 have performed in many countries throughout the world, releasing four albums. As of 2016, three original members are still actively performing as the Quarrymen."@en ;

From 1974 until 1985, the band comprised guitarist Eddie Van Halen, vocalist David Lee Roth, drummer Alex Van Halen, and bassist Michael Anthony. The band went on to become major stars, and by the early 1980s they were one of the most successful rock acts of the time. 1984 was their most successful album. The lead single, \"Jump\", became an international hit and their only single to reach number one on the Billboard Hot 100. The following singles, \"Panama\" and \"I'll Wait\", both hit number 13 on the U.S. charts. The album went on to sell over 12 million copies in the U.S. alone. In 1985, the band replaced lead singer David Lee Roth with ex-Montrose lead vocalist Sammy Hagar. With Hagar, the group would release four U.S. number-one albums over the course of 11 years. Hagar left the band in 1996 shortly before the release of the band's first greatest hits collection, Best Of \u2013 Volume I. Former Extreme frontman Gary Cherone was quickly recruited as lead singer to replace Hagar, and Van Halen III was released in 1998. Cherone left the band in frustration in 1999 after the tour due to the poor commercial performance of the album. Van Halen went on hiatus until 2003 when they reunited with Hagar for a worldwide tour. The reunited band released a second greatest hits collection the following year, The Best of Both Worlds. Like Volume I before it, The Best of Both Worlds included material from both the Roth and Hagar eras but omitted any Cherone era tracks. The album featured three brand new tracks recorded by the reunited band, two of which were released as singles. Hagar again left Van Halen in 2005, and in 2006 Roth returned as lead vocalist for their highest-grossing tour, and one of the highest-grossing tours of that year. Anthony was not invited to participate in the tour and was essentially fired from the band, replaced by Wolfgang Van Halen, Eddie's son. In 2012, the band released the commercially and critically successful, A Different Kind of Truth, with Roth as lead vocalist. According to the RIAA, Van Halen is the 19th-best-selling band/artist in United States history, selling 56 million albums in the U.S. They were also revealed at number 4 on the Billboard's top moneymakers list in 2013. Van Halen is one of only five rock bands that have had two studio albums sell more than 10 million copies in the U.S. Additionally, Van Halen charted the most number-one hits in the history of Billboard's Mainstream Rock chart and they are one of the world's best-selling bands of all time, having sold more than 80 million records. Van Halen achieved worldwide fame for their many popular songs and larger-than-life stage performances; they also became known for the drama surrounding the departures of former members. Controversy surrounded the band following the exits of Roth, Hagar, and Anthony; this controversy often included numerous conflicting press statements between the former members and the band. In 2007, Van Halen was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. VH1 ranked them 7th on their list of the top 100 hard rock artists of all time."@en ;

Since their formation, they became Pakistan's first and most commercially successful as well as critically acclaimed act. The band's popular lineup consisted of keyboardist Rohail Hyatt, bassist Shahzad Hasan, guitarist Nusrat Hussain and vocalist Junaid Jamshed. Rooted in Rawalpindi with some influence from Western music during the conservative regime of President Zia-ul-Haq, the Vital Signs utilizes several genres, ranging from pop music to rock, and often incorporating classical and other elements in innovative ways. In the early 1990s, they came to be perceived by many Pakistani fans and country's cultural observers as a \"promising new era of cultural revival\". Their enormous popularity significantly opened a new wave of music and a modern chapter in the history of Pakistan. The band built its reputation playing in university campuses and underground rock music concerts held in different parts of the country, before being noticed by PTV performing art section director Shoaib Mansoor. The band initially gained national prominence and popularity from their music video of their single \"Dil Dil Pakistan\" first aired on PTV. Written by Shaoib Mansoor, the song became a big commercial hit and critically acclaimed in the public; it was voted, in an unscientific poll as the third most popular song of all time by BBC World. By the early 1990s, the band members had become public celebrities and international stars in the midst of the 1990s. From the 1980s to the 1990s, they produced many of their highly successful and critically praised albums, what many cultural critics consider their finest material including the innovative and widely influential albums, Vital Signs-1 (1989), Vital Sign-2 (1991), Aitebar (1993) and Hum Tum (1995). The success of their second album marked the international prominence of the band, first traveling to the United States to perform, becoming the first Pakistani music act to go abroad on a tour. After the disintegrating and fading of the band in 1998, they each enjoyed successful musical careers. Leading singer Junaid Jamshed went on to pursue a career as a solo singer, Shahzad Hasan concentrated on his work as a music producer and Rohail Hyatt formed a production company. The Vital Signs is considered one of the most successful bands in Pakistan, having influenced many of the pop, rock, and heavy metal musical groups originating from Pakistan."@en ;

Akimoto has expanded the AKB48 concept to several in Japan, China and Indonesia. The group is one of the highest-earning musical performers in Japan, with 2013 sales of over $128 million, and has been characterized as a social phenomenon. As of December 2015 the group has sold over 41 million records, including over 36 million singles and over 5 millon albums. AKB48 is the highest selling musical act in Japan in terms of singles sold and the highest by a girl group. AKB48's twenty-nine latest singles have topped the Oricon Weekly Singles Chart, with a record twenty-three singles selling over a million copies; their highest selling single, \"Sayonara Crawl\", sold over 1.95 million in 2013. In 2010 \"Beginner\" and \"Heavy Rotation\" placed first and second, respectively, on the list of Japan's best-selling singles for the year. In all consecutive years since then, AKB48's singles have occupied the top four or five spots of the Oricon Yearly Singles Chart."@en ;

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_(band)>	rdf:type	dbo:Band ;
	dbo:abstract	"Ancient is a Norwegian black metal band from Bergen, formed in 1992. The band released six full-length albums released by Metal Blade Records to date and a variety of mini-albums, EPs and special releases. Ancient used to have the classic raw black metal sound, similar to Darkthrone's works. Beginning with The Cainian Chronicle, they moved towards a more Nordic/atmospheric black metal sound, akin to Emperor and a cleaner production. After a period of turmoil concerning their line-up, they went on to add gothic-style instruments such as violins, a female vocalist, and synthesizers to their music. To this day Ancient can be considered as one of the original Norwegian black metal bands that were part of the now famous scene of the early nineties. They were one of the very first Norwegian black metal bands to sign for a semi-major label (Metal Blade Records). There is no evidence of any involvement of Ancient with the infamous occurrences of the Norwegian black metal scene, although they were part of the same scene. Ancient can be considered as a historical black metal act by all standards, whose path took a different course upon their relocation around the world and subsequent exit from the local Norwegian scene."@en ;

GBH were early pioneers of English street punk, often nicknamed \"UK82\", along with Discharge, Broken Bones, The Exploited and The Varukers. They have gone on to influence several punk rock musicians. The name GBH was inspired by then-bassist Sean McCarthy's trial for grievous bodily harm, though some fans also believe it is an acronym for \"Great Britain Hardcore\" and \"Great Big Hair\". Though the core line up of Colin, Ross and Jock has stayed the same throughout their history the drum stool has been occupied by a number of incumbents following Wilf's departure after the Midnight Madness and Beyond album and Oh No It's GBH again 12\" ep. 1986 saw the arrival of German drummer Kai Reder who played on three albums and an EP (No Need To Panic, A Fridge Too Far and From Here To Reality, as well as the \"Wot A Bargain\" 12\"), Kai was then replaced by American, Joe \"Fish\" Montanero for one album (Church of The Truly Warped), this was the band's last release for the Rough Justice label. The drum stool was then occupied from around 1994 by former Bomb Disneyland/Bomb Everything drummer Scott Preece, who has remained to this day and played on all releases since."@en ;

The band is composed of founding members (and sisters) Martie Erwin Maguire and Emily Erwin Robison, and lead singer Natalie Maines. The band formed in 1989 in Dallas, Texas, and was originally composed of four women performing bluegrass and country music, busking and touring the bluegrass festival circuits and small venues for six years without attracting a major label. After the departure of one bandmate, the replacement of their lead singer, and a slight change in their repertoire, Dixie Chicks soon achieved commercial success, beginning in 1998 with hit songs \"There's Your Trouble\" and \"Wide Open Spaces\". On March 10, 2003, during a London concert, nine days before the March 19, 2003 invasion of Iraq, lead vocalist Maines told the audience: \"We don't want this war, this violence, and we're ashamed that the President of the United States (George W. Bush) is from Texas\". The positive reaction to this statement from the British audience contrasted with the negative reaction including boycotts that ensued in the US, where the band was denounced by talk-show conservatives, while their albums were discarded in public protest. As of 2015, Dixie Chicks have won 13 Grammy Awards, including five in 2007 for Taking the Long Way\u2014which received the Grammy Award for Album of the Year\u2014and \"Not Ready to Make Nice\", a single from that album. By December 2015, with 30.5 million certified albums sold, and sales of 27.5 million albums in the U.S. alone, they had become the top selling all-female band and biggest selling country group in the U.S. during the Nielsen SoundScan era (1991\u2013present)."@en ;

dbr:Fields_of_Aplomb	rdf:type	dbo:Band ;
	dbo:abstract	"Fields of Aplomb, abbreviated FoA, is a Gothic metal/alternative band formed in Baltimore in 1998 upon the demise of Pelican's Daughter. known for surrealistic and gloomy lyrics. Their first album, Reverence for the Lost, addresses themes of extreme introversion. Their second release Nekromanteia (2003), is based on the writings of Eliphas Levi (1810\u20131875), a French occultist who helped revive interest in magic in the 19th century. Levi studied magic and practiced necromancy on several occasions. In 2004 FoA released Spiritum Oriundus as a continuance of spiritual magic, however, focusing on seances and tormented appiritions. In the winter of 2006, FoA released Weoroscipe which illuminated the power of seduction, black magic, fetishes, and faith. Disillusionment (2006) includes remaster of \"Reverence for the Lost\" and \"Nekromaneia\" plus two additional songs and a DVD. The band took their name from the folklore tale of the inscribed surrounding land to the ancient Sumerian society (Fourth B.C), stating that those who died, either violently or tragically, their souls were to wonder the Fields of Adplumbum (Aplomb) until they acknowledged and accepted their fate."@en ;

They are named after a square in the city of Munich in Germany, meaning \"Munich liberty\". It is considered part of the Neue Deutsche Welle musical movement. They are best known in the English-speaking world for their single \"Keeping the Dream Alive\". This song became a #14 hit single in the UK Singles Chart when released in December 1988, making M\u00FCnchener Freiheit a one-hit wonder there. Due to its December release and rich orchestral sound, \"Keeping the Dream Alive\" still receives a lot of airplay at Christmas time and can be found included on many Christmas compilation albums. In the United States the song failed to chart there when it was originally released, gaining favour with the American public only after it was featured in the soundtrack for the movie Say Anything.... The single has received additional exposure in the United States thanks to the singing talent contest American Idol on the Fox television network. The song has been used in recent seasons as a backdrop to video montages featuring contestants on the programme."@en ;

Headed by lead vocalist Raine Maida since its formation, the band additionally consists of Duncan Coutts on bass, and Steve Mazur as lead guitarist. Longtime drummer Jeremy Taggart left the band in 2014, and a replacement drummer has not yet been announced. The band has sold millions of albums worldwide, won four Juno Awards, and won ten MuchMusic Video Awards \u2014 the most MMVAs ever awarded to any artist or group. Our Lady Peace are one of Canada's most popular bands, they were also one of the few Canadian rock acts to actually achieved success in both decades of the 90s and 2000s. They have released eight studio albums, one live album, and two compilation albums to date, with their 1997 album Clumsy often being considered their signature and most widely recognized work. Our Lady Peace enjoyed many hit singles, ranging from \"Starseed\" in 1994, to \"Somewhere Out There\" in 2002. The band's earlier albums are often praised for their unique sound and style, with lead singer Maida being called \"erratic\" and \"truly unrivaled\" as a vocalist. Their fifth album, Gravity (2002), is sometimes noted to have been a \"radical departure\" from this distinctive style. Lead singer Maida has confirmed the difference, calling Gravity \"vastly different\" from their previous records. The coincidental 2002 departures of both co-founding member Mike Turner and longtime-producer Arnold Lanni, in combination with influence from then-new producer Bob Rock are sometimes credited as main factors in the style evolution."@en ;

They also received the \"Newcomer Award\" at the Japan Gold Disc Awards in January 2008; they were the first Korean artists to receive this award. In 2008, due to Hyun-joong being cast in Boys Over Flowers and Jung-min being cast in the musical Grease, a SS501 Project Group consisting of Heo Young-saeng, Kim Kyu-jong and Kim Hyung-jun was formed and they released U R Man. During their promotion, Heo was the leader of the sub-unit group. In 2009, SS501 came back as a five-member group and released Rebirth.

They consist of founding members Dave Chandler (guitarist) and Mark Adams (bass), alongside sporadic singer Scott Weinrich and recently added drummer Henry Vasquez. The band has been regarded and credited as one of the first bands of the genre, along with Pentagram, Witchfinder General, Trouble and Pagan Altar. They have released eight studio albums to date. Although Saint Vitus never achieved a popular breakthrough, the band is considered very influential within the doom and sludge metal subgenres. The original line-up consisted of Chandler, Adams, drummer Armando Acosta and singer Scott Reagers. They recorded their first two albums before Scott Weinrich replaced Reagers in 1986. The line-up of Chandler, Adams, Acosta and Weinrich was the longest-lasting, and recorded the band's next three albums, Born Too Late (1986), Mournful Cries (1988) and V (1990). Weinrich left the band in 1991 to focus on the reunion of his previous band The Obsessed, and was replaced by Chritus Linderson of Swedish doom metal band Count Raven. Saint Vitus recorded the album C.O.D. (1992) before Linderson was dismissed from the band. In 1994, Saint Vitus reunited with Reagers and recorded Die Healing (1995), which would be their final album for 17 years. After breaking up in 1996 and briefly reforming in 2003, Saint Vitus reunited again in 2008 with the band's \"classic\" line-up, featuring Weinrich, Chandler, Adams and Acosta, and embarked on a successful tour. After 31 years in the band, Acosta left Saint Vitus in 2009 due to worsening health, and was replaced by Henry Vasquez. The new line-up went on to record their latest album Lillie: F-65, which was released on April 27, 2012."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Santana is an American Latin rock band formed in San Francisco, California in 1967 by Mexican guitarist Carlos Santana. The band first came to widespread public attention when their performance of \"Soul Sacrifice\" at Woodstock in 1969 provided a contrast to other acts on the bill. This exposure helped propel their first album, also named Santana, into a hit, followed in the next two years by the successful Abraxas and Santana III. In the years that followed lineup changes were common. Carlos Santana's increasing involvement with guru Sri Chinmoy took the band into more esoteric music, though never quite losing its initial Latin influence. In 1998, the group was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, with Carlos Santana, Jose Chepito Areas, David Brown, Gregg Rolie, Mike Carabello and Michael Shrieve being honored. The band has earned eight Grammy Awards and three Latin Grammy Awards, the latter all in 2000. Carlos also won Grammy Awards as a solo artist in 1989 and 2003. Santana has sold more than 90 million records worldwide, making them one of the world\u2019s best-selling groups of all time. In 2013, Santana announced a reunion of the classic line-up for a new record, predicting a 2014 release. They are tied with having the most won Grammys in one night."@en ;

Their first album, River of Fallen Stars, was released under the name \"Pete and Maura Kennedy\"; they released all subsequent albums as \"The Kennedys\". They met in Austin, Texas in 1992, when Pete Kennedy was playing in Nanci Griffith's band, and for their first date, each drove 500 miles to meet at Buddy Holly's grave in Lubbock, Texas. Soon, Maura Boudreau joined Griffith's band as a harmony singer, and they began their career as a duo when they opened for her during her tour in Ireland. They are influenced by the Byrds and other 1960s rock and folk-rock artists. Their 1998 album Angel Fire featured many songs with literary references, such as \"A Letter To Emily\" and \"Just Like Henry David\". When performing live Pete plays the acoustic guitar, electric sitar, bass and ukulele, while Maura plays acoustic and electric guitars and uke. They have performed in clubs and theatres throughout the United States, a cruise, and at Bill Clinton's first and second inaugurations. Pete is from the Northern Virginia suburbs of Washington, D.C. Maura grew up in Syracuse, New York. After many years living in the East Village in New York City in 2006 joined the many other folk musicians living in Northampton, Massachusetts. They then returned to the East Village in 2008. In late 2006, Pete and Maura joined with Chris and Meredith Thompson to form The Strangelings, a folk-rock band prominently featuring Pete's electric sitar. Their first performance was on January 12, 2007. The music includes songs by both the Kennedys and the Thompsons in addition to traditional songs and covers. The current full lineup of The Strangelings includes Pete, Maura, Chris Thompson, Eric Lee on fiddle, Cheryl Prashker on percussion, and Ken Anderson and Rebecca Hall, also known as Hungrytown."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Biffy Clyro are a Scottish rock band that formed in Kilmarnock, East Ayrshire, composed of Simon Neil (guitar, lead vocals), James Johnston (bass, vocals) and Ben Johnston (drums, vocals). Currently signed to 14th Floor Records, they have released six studio albums, three of which (Puzzle, Only Revolutions and Opposites) reached the top five in the UK Albums Chart, with their sixth studio album Opposites claiming their first UK number one album. After their first three albums, the band expanded their following significantly in 2007 with the release of their fourth, Puzzle, creating more mainstream songs with simpler rhythms and distancing themselves from the more unusual dissonant style that was present in their previous three albums. Puzzle peaked at number 2 on the official UK album charts on 16 June 2007. The album went Gold in the UK, selling over 100,000 units, and later in 2012 went Platinum in the UK, having sold over 300,000 copies. Their 2009 album, Only Revolutions, reached No. 3 in the UK chart and went gold within days of its release in 2009, going platinum later in 2010 and receiving a Mercury Music Prize nomination. Only Revolutions included the UK hit singles, \"Mountains\", \"That Golden Rule\" and \"Many of Horror\" all of which reached the UK Top Ten. The latter reached number eight on the UK Singles Chart after The X Factor 2010 winner Matt Cardle covered the song, and became the UK number one Christmas single for the year of 2010. In 2011 the band was nominated for the Brit Award for Best British Group. At the 2013 NME Awards they received the award for Best British Band. On 25 August 2013 Biffy Clyro headlined the main stage at Leeds & Reading Festival. Based on their album and single certifications, the band have sold in excess of 1,240,000 albums and 400,000 singles in the UK alone."@en ;

Although generally considered a post-hardcore band, Fightstar are also known to implement metal, progressive, alternative rock and acoustic elements into their sound. During the band's initial emergence, they were faced with much scepticism due to Simpson's former pop career. However, they began to receive positive reactions to early live shows and their debut EP, They Liked You Better When You Were Dead (2005), was a critical success. Since then, their three studio albums have obtained top 40 chartings and critical praise. Fightstar's debut album, Grand Unification (2006) was regarded as \"one of the best British rock albums of the past decade\" by Kerrang! editor Paul Brannigan. The band went onto receive nominations at the Kerrang! Awards for \"Best British Band\", before releasing their second album, One Day Son, This Will All Be Yours (2007). The following year a compilation album including b-sides and rarities titled, Alternate Endings (2008) was released. The band then self-funded and co-produced their third album, Be Human (2009), which heavily featured orchestral and choral elements. It became their highest charting album after peaking at number twenty in the UK Albums Chart. The band announced an extended hiatus in 2010, allowing its members to concentrate on other projects, including Simpson's solo album; before announcing their reunion in 2014."@en ;

They are generally considered to be one of the most important bands in the Portuguese rock scene and have since reached a cult status. Since the start of their career, their live concerts became famous for their intensity and dark mood, due to their signature alternative rock sound and the performance of vocalist Adolfo Lux\u00FAria Canibal (a pseudonym, meaning Adolph Cannibal Lust), known for occasional onstage theatrics and his gravelly voice, half-sung, half-spoken singing style. M\u00E3o Morta's music is quite difficult to categorize as they seem to incorporate a variety of genres; from punk rock, metal, to industrial and experimental. Their sound, combined with Adolfo's lyrics, reflects urban violence, a human search for pleasure, freedom and a critique of contemporary consumerist society, often with sarcastic humour."@en ;

Originally signed to Kemado Records, the group released its debut album Age of Winters in 2006, the material for which had been largely written by Cronise. Follow-up album Gods of the Earth was released two years later and gave the group its first entry on the US Billboard 200 chart.

Wingo left the group later in the year and was replaced briefly by Kevin Fender, before Vela joined in 2011. After signing with Razor & Tie in 2012 the group released its fourth album Apocryphon, which was promoted worldwide on the Apocryphon Tour. The band's fifth album, High Country, was released in 2015. The Sword is commonly categorized as a stoner metal or doom metal band, and is influenced by groups such as Black Sabbath and Sleep. The band has toured with a wide range of fellow metal artists, including ...And You Will Know Us by the Trail of Dead, Year Long Disaster, and Metallica on multiple occasions.

They initially faced legal difficulty in Austria due to the (obviously intended) similarity of their band name to that of the corporation \"Erste Allgemeine Versicherung\". This was later dropped and the insurance company was even known to sponsor them on a few occasions. The EAV often changed their members. Their members as of today are Klaus Eberhartinger (Vocals), Thomas Spitzer (Guitar, Vocals), Kurt Keinrath (Guitar, Keyboard, bass guitar), Franz Kreimer (Keyboard), Alvis Reid (Bass guitar) and Aaron Thier (Drums). The band is known for open statements against political extremism especially on the right (\"bacillus nationalis\") and was sued by prominent politicians of the political right like Kurt Waldheim for drawing attention to his past in the 3rd Reich and J\u00F6rg Haider then head of the right-leaning FP\u00D6. Songs on this topic include e.g. \"Eierkopf-Rudi\" or \"Wir marschieren\". Their songs are mostly jovial in nature, but the lyrics contain hints of social criticism as well. For example, \"Cinderella\" (1994) is one of their \"fun\" songs, in which they tell the tale of Cinderella in a funny way: \"Sie schlief im Kohlenkeller, trotzdem war sie bettelarm, weil sie von der vielen Kohle, die da lag, zu wenig nahm\" (\"She slept in the coal cellar, but she was dirt-poor, because she didn't take much of the plentiful coal that lay there\"). The word \"Kohle\" (\"coal\") is a colloquial word for money in German. The stage shows are known for lavishness in both backdrop and costumes, the latter often selected and changed for specific songs that are then acted out by either the vocalist or other members. Despite the band's failed attempt to gain international fame, they still remain quite popular in Germany and Austria."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Indian Ocean is an Indian rock band formed in New Delhi in 1990, who are widely recognized as the pioneers of the fusion rock genre in India. Susmit Sen, Asheem Chakravarty, Rahul Ram and Amit Kilam were band members till Chakravarty's death on 25 December 2009, after which Tuheen Chakravorty and Himanshu Joshi were officially inducted into the band as replacements. After the departure of Susmit Sen in 2013, Rahul Ram is the only founding member who appeared on the band's debut album Indian Ocean. The musical style of the band can be at best classified as fusion music. It is an experimental genre, fusing raga (traditional Indian tunes) with rock music, guitars and drums, sometimes using Indian folk songs. It has also been described by some music critics as \"Indo-rock fusion with jazz-spiced rhythms that integrates shlokas, sufism, environmentalism, mythology and revolution\". Since 2010, the band has moved against the lines of record labels. They released their latest album 16/330 Khajoor Road online for free. The main reason for this move was the frustration over negotiating contracts with record companies and fighting over copyright issues. They have turned to concerts and sponsorships for generating revenue rather than playing in the hands of record labels. For a brief amount of time they had the sponsorship of Johnnie Walker. They are also a part of the world's first Music Personalisation Initiative named DRP as one of the five Featured Artists. In its 2014 listing of \"25 Greatest Indian Rock Songs of the last 25 Years\", \"Rolling Stone India\" featured two songs, Ma Rewa and Kandisa from the album, Kandisa (2000)."@en ;

Their first single, \"Painted Moon,\" was a minor international hit and invited critical comparisons to Simple Minds and U2. In 1987 they released their first album A Letter From St. Paul, which included \"Painted Moon\" and another minor hit, \"I See Red.\" Buoyed by the huge European hit \"Bulletproof Heart\", the band's third album Dance to the Holy Man is the band's commercial peak to date.

Formed in 2000 by vocalist and guitarist Andrew Stockdale, bassist and keyboardist Chris Ross, and drummer Myles Heskett, the group currently includes Stockdale, bassist and keyboardist Ian Peres, and touring drummer Alex Carapetis. Wolfmother released their self-titled debut album Wolfmother in Australia in 2005, and internationally in 2006, which has since sold over 1.5 million copies worldwide and won the band a number of industry awards. Ross and Heskett left the band in 2008. Stockdale returned with a new lineup featuring Peres, rhythm guitarist Aidan Nemeth and drummer Dave Atkins in 2009, releasing Cosmic Egg later in the year. After more personnel changes, the group's planned third album was released in 2013 as Keep Moving, a Stockdale solo album. Later that year, Wolfmother returned as a trio featuring Peres and drummer Vin Steele for 2014's New Crown. The band's fourth album Victorious was released in February 2016. Wolfmother have been categorised by various commentators within the genres of hard rock, heavy metal, stoner rock and psychedelic rock. They are often compared to influential classic rock and metal bands from the 1960s and 1970s, including Led Zeppelin, Black Sabbath, Blue Cheer and AC/DC. Frontman Stockdale has typically led songwriting for the group, although the material on the band's debut album was co-credited to Ross and Heskett.

The album influenced the same dance-oriented sound of their third album Supernature. Supernature took Goldfrapp's work further into dance music, and enjoyed international chart success. The album produced three number-one US dance singles, and was nominated for Best Electronic/Dance Album at the 49th Grammy Awards. Their fourth album Seventh Tree placed a greater emphasis on ambient and downtempo music, drawing inspiration from nature and paganism, while their fifth album, Head First, found the group exploring 1980s-influenced synthpop. Head First also earned the duo their second Grammy Award nomination for Best Electronic/Dance Album in 2010.

They formed in 1997, initially with N'fa's brother, Kabba, who moved to London in 1998. Their first album, Choose One (2002), was a crossover success which debuted at #20 in the Australian music charts, leading to an ARIA award nomination for \"breakthrough artist\" and winning \"best debut artist\" and \"best hip-hop act\" awards at the Dance Music Awards.

The group also played a support slot on a Linkin Park tour that year and went on their own tour supported by American rapper Princess Superstar. Following the release of their second album, Consistency Theory (2004) and subsequent touring, the group went on hiatus in 2005 to allow the individual members to pursue solo work.

The band's music generally consisted of hard, garage and blues rock. Their next album, Bone to Pick (1995) also incorporated heavy metal. The band collaborated with Peter McConnell of LucasArts to produce the soundtrack to the biker-themed adventure game Full Throttle; tracks from Bone to Pick were specifically adapted for this purpose. Blue Pyramid (1998), their third and final album, also included experimentation with psychedelic rock. The band broke up in 1999, though not before signing up a new label for distributing their music in Europe. In late 2001, Karloff started working on a new musical project. Led by his passion for the old style rock music, he formed the Bonedrivers, a blues rock power trio which has since then toured the United States and published a locally acclaimed debut album named Roadhouse Manifesto, an even bigger second outing titled Mobile, and a third one titled Greasefire."@en ;

In the following years, they recorded their \"Brown Bag\" demo, and went out on a few small tours. After a few volatile years which saw several collective moves and incarnations, the group solidified its line-up and relocated to New York City. The current line-up includes Michelle Proffit (vocals), Dave Sanders (guitar, backing vocals), Derek Wimble (bass), and Justin Williams (drums). The band performs a form of hardcore punk, incorporating melodic indie rock style riffs, often in 6/8 time. Michelle Proffit's vocal style consists mostly of screaming and screeching the lyrics. The lyrics lean towards the left-wing side of the political scale. The band recorded its first EP in early 2002 with producer Don Fury. The result, Invasive/Exotic, was released on G7 Welcoming Committee Records in May, 2002. After touring a bit for the record, the band split up that same year. The members were convinced to re-form in late 2003 by the people at G7 Records. Newly reformed with the same lineup, the band began working on songs that would eventually be recorded and released their first full-length album, End States (2005), again on G7 Welcoming Committee Records."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Rage Against the Machine (also known as RATM or just Rage) is an American political rap metal band from Los Angeles, California. Formed in 1991, the group consists of rapper and vocalist Zack de la Rocha, bassist and backing vocalist Tim Commerford, guitarist Tom Morello and drummer Brad Wilk. They draw inspiration from early heavy metal instrumentation, as well as hip hop acts such as Afrika Bambaataa, Public Enemy, the Beastie Boys and Dutch crossover band Urban Dance Squad. Rage Against the Machine is well known for the members' leftist and revolutionary political views, which are expressed in many of the band's songs. As of 2010, they have sold over 16 million records worldwide. In 1992, the band released its self-titled debut album, which became a commercial and critical success, leading to a slot in the 1993 Lollapalooza festival. In 2003, the album was ranked number 368 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time. The band did not release a follow-up record until 1996, with Evil Empire. The band's third album, The Battle of Los Angeles, followed in 1999, and in 2003, the album was ranked number 426 on the same list. During their initial nine-year run, they became one of the most popular and influential bands in music history, according to music journalist Colin Devenish. They were also ranked No. 33 on VH1's 100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock. The band had a large influence on the nu metal genre which came to prominence during the second half of the 1990s. In 2000, the band released the cover album, Renegades. The same year, growing tensions over the direction of the band prompted de la Rocha to quit, leading to the band's breakup. De la Rocha started a low-key solo career, while the rest of the band formed the rock supergroup Audioslave with Chris Cornell, then-former frontman of Soundgarden; Audioslave recorded three albums before disbanding in 2007. The same year, Rage Against the Machine announced a reunion and performed together for the first time in seven years at the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival in April 2007. Up until 2011, the band continued to perform at more live venues and festivals around the world. As of 2016, the group has no plans to perform or release new music."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Scorpions are a German rock band formed in 1965 in Hanover by Rudolf Schenker. Since the band's inception, its musical style has ranged from hard rock to heavy metal. The lineup from 1978\u201392 was the most successful incarnation of the group, and included Klaus Meine (vocals), Rudolf Schenker (rhythm guitar), Matthias Jabs (lead guitar), Francis Buchholz (bass guitar), and Herman Rarebell (drums). The band's only constant member is Rudolf Schenker, although Meine has been the lead singer for all of the band's studio albums, and Jabs has been a consistent member since 1979. During the mid-1970s, with guitarist Uli Jon Roth part of the line-up, the music of Scorpions was defined as hard rock. After the departure of Roth in 1978, Matthias Jabs joined and, following the guidance of producer Dieter Dierks, Scorpions changed their sound towards melodic heavy metal, mixed with rock power ballads. Throughout the 1980s the group received positive reviews and critical acclaim from music critics, and experienced commercial success with the albums Animal Magnetism (1980), Blackout (1982), Love at First Sting (1984), World Wide Live (1985) and Savage Amusement (1988). Their best-selling album Crazy World (1990) includes the song \"Wind of Change\", a symbolic anthem of the political changes in Eastern Europe in the late 1980s and early 1990s and the fall of the Berlin Wall. It is one of the best-selling singles in the world with over fourteen million copies sold. Scorpions have sold over 100 million records in total. They have released 18 studio albums, 27 compilation albums and 74 singles. Six of their singles have reached number one on the charts in different countries. Their albums, singles, compilations and video releases have reached 200 times gold, platinum and multi-platinum status in different countries. Rolling Stone magazine describes Scorpions as \"the heroes of heavy metal\", and MTV called them \"Ambassadors of Rock\". The band was ranked number 46 on VH1's Greatest Artists of Hard Rock programme, with \"Rock You Like a Hurricane\" at number 18 on VH1's list of the 100 Greatest Hard Rock Songs. \"Still Loving You\" ranked 22nd place among the greatest ballads. Scorpions have received prestigious awards such as three World Music Awards, a star on the Hollywood Rock wall, and a presence in the permanent exhibition of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. In 2015 the group celebrated its 50th anniversary."@en ;

dbr:The_Magnetic_Fields	rdf:type	dbo:Band ;
	dbo:abstract	"The Magnetic Fields (named after the Andr\u00E9 Breton/Philippe Soupault novel Les Champs Magn\u00E9tiques) is an American indie pop group founded and led by Stephin Merritt. He is the group's primary songwriter, producer and vocalist, as well as frequent multi-instrumentalist. The Magnetic Fields is essentially a vehicle for Merritt's songwriting, as are various side-projects, such as The 6ths, Future Bible Heroes and The Gothic Archies. While the musical style of the band is as malleable as Merritt's songwriting, its songs are commonly attributed to pop genres such as synthpop, indie pop, and noise pop. The band is often cited[citation needed] as being recognizable by Merritt's lyrics, often about love and often with irregular or neutral gender roles, that are by turns ironic, tongue-in-cheek, bitter, and humorous. The band released their debut single \"100,000 Fireflies\" in 1991, which was typical of the band's earlier career characterized by synthesized instrumentation by Merritt with lead vocals provided by Susan Anway (and then by Stephin Merritt himself from The House of Tomorrow EP onwards). A more traditional band later materialized, currently composed of Merritt, Claudia Gonson, Sam Davol, and John Woo, with occasional guest vocals by Shirley Simms. Their best-known work is the 1999 three-volume concept album 69 Love Songs. It was followed in the succeeding years by a \"no-synth\" trilogy: i (2004), Distortion (2008), and Realism (2010). The band's most recent album, Love at the Bottom of the Sea, was released in 2012."@en ;

dbr:Wilco	rdf:type	dbo:Band ;
	dbo:abstract	"Wilco is an American alternative rock band based in Chicago, Illinois. The band was formed in 1994 by the remaining members of alternative country group Uncle Tupelo following singer Jay Farrar's departure. Wilco's lineup changed frequently during its first decade, with only singer Jeff Tweedy and bassist John Stirratt remaining from the original incarnation. Since early 2004, the lineup has been unchanged, consisting of Tweedy, Stirratt, guitarist Nels Cline, multi-instrumentalist Pat Sansone, keyboard player Mikael Jorgensen, and drummer Glenn Kotche. Wilco has released nine studio albums, a live double album, and four collaborations: three with Billy Bragg and one with The Minus 5. Wilco's music has been inspired by a wide variety of artists and styles, including Bill Fay, The Beatles and Television, and has in turn influenced music by a number of modern alternative rock acts. The band continued in the alternative country of Uncle Tupelo on its debut album A.M. (1995), but has since introduced more experimental aspects to their music, including elements of alternative rock and classic pop. Wilco's musical style has evolved from a 1990s country rock sound to a current \"eclectic indie rock collective that touches on many eras and genres.\" Wilco garnered media attention for their fourth album, Yankee Hotel Foxtrot (2002), and the controversy surrounding it. After the recording sessions were complete, Reprise Records rejected the album and dismissed Wilco from the label. As part of a buy-out deal, Reprise gave Wilco the rights to the album for free. After streaming Foxtrot on its website, Wilco sold the album to Nonesuch Records in 2002. Both record labels are subsidiaries of Warner Music Group, leading one critic to say the album showed \"how screwed up the music business is in the early twenty-first century.\" Yankee Hotel Foxtrot is Wilco's most successful release to date, selling over 670,000 copies. Wilco won two Grammy Awards for their fifth studio album, 2004's A Ghost Is Born, including Best Alternative Music Album. Wilco's most recent studio album, Star Wars, was released on July 16, 2015."@en ;

Their success on both pop and dance charts have earned the group a listing in The Guinness Book of World Records as the all-female group with the most chart entries in the world, a record which they still hold. They released their debut single \"Aie a Mwana\" in 1981. The group's 10 UK Top 10 hits include \"It Ain't What You Do...\" (1982), \"Really Saying Something\" (1982), \"Shy Boy\" (1982), \"Na Na Hey Hey Kiss Him Goodbye\" (1983), \"Cruel Summer\" (1983), \"Robert De Niro's Waiting...\" (1984) and \"Love in the First Degree\" (1987). In 1986, they had a US number one with another of their UK Top 10 hits, \"Venus\". In total, they had 11 singles reach the US Billboard Hot 100 (1983-1988), including two more in the top 10, with \"Cruel Summer\" (1984) and \"I Heard a Rumour\" (1987). They are associated with the MTV-driven Second British Invasion of the US. In 1988, \"Love in the First Degree\" earned them a Brit Award nomination for Best British Single, while their fourth album Wow! (1987), topped the Australian ARIA albums chart. Following Fahey's departure from the group in 1988, Jacquie O'Sullivan joined the group for three years and they had UK Top 10 hits with \"I Want You Back\" (1988) and \"Help!\" (1989). In addition to their chart success, the band is also known for their vocal style, generally singing in unison rather than in harmony like most vocal groups. Since 1992, Woodward and Dallin have continued Bananarama as a duo, with hits including \"Movin' On\" (1992) and \"More, More, More\" (1993). They returned to the UK Top 20 for the first time since 1991 with the 2005 single \"Move in My Direction\". Between 1982 and 2009, they had 28 singles reach the Top 50 of the UK singles chart."@en ;

The band's lineup has remained mostly static during its history, with the only exceptions being the 1994 dismissal of bass player Alec John Such, who was unofficially replaced by Hugh McDonald, and the departure of longtime guitarist and co-songwriter Richie Sambora in 2013. In 1986, Bon Jovi achieved widespread global recognition with their third album, Slippery When Wet. The band's fourth album, New Jersey was equally successful in 1988.

In 1992, the band returned with the album Keep the Faith. Their 2000 single \"It's My Life\", which followed a second hiatus, successfully introduced the band to a younger audience. Bon Jovi have been known to use different styles in their music, which has included country for their 2007 album Lost Highway.

Cake was formed in 1991 by McCrea, DiFiore, Greg Brown, Frank French and Sean McFessel, who soon left and was replaced by Nelson. Following the self-release of its debut album, Motorcade of Generosity, the band was signed to Capricorn Records in 1995 and released its first single, \"Rock 'n' Roll Lifestyle\", which hit number 35 on the Modern Rock Tracks music chart and was featured on MTV's 120 Minutes; French and Nelson then left the band, and were replaced by Todd Roper and Victor Damiani. Cake's second album, 1996's Fashion Nugget, went platinum on the strength of its lead single, \"The Distance\". Following a tour of Europe and the United States, both Brown and Damiani announced they were leaving Cake, which led to speculation about the band's future; McCrea eventually recruited Xan McCurdy to take over on guitar, and persuaded Nelson to return. Prolonging the Magic, the band's third album, was released in 1998 and went platinum, having shipped over one million units; this was followed three years later by Comfort Eagle, the band's first album on Columbia Records, featuring the single \"Short Skirt/Long Jacket\" which hit number 7 on the Modern Rock Tracks chart.

Their greatest success was in the 1980s with the number-one album, Sports, coupled with a series of highly successful MTV videos. Their worldwide fame expanded when the song \"The Power of Love\" was featured as a key track in the film Back to the Future (in which Lewis had a cameo appearance), became a number-one hit, and was nominated for an Academy Award. The News combined a rock (and sometimes, a \"blues-rock\") backing with soul and doo-wop-influenced harmony vocals and Lewis' voice.[citation needed]"@en ;

dbr:Kreator	rdf:type	dbo:Band ;
	dbo:abstract	"Kreator is a German thrash metal band from Essen. Their style of music is similar to that of their compatriots Destruction, Sodom and Tankard; along with those three bands, Kreator has been referred to as one of the \"big four\" of Teutonic thrash metal, and they are often credited with helping pioneer death metal and black metal by containing several elements of what was to become those genres. They originally performed a speed metal style with Venom influences. Kreator's work began in the vein of thrash metal but ventured into industrial metal and gothic metal from 1992 to 1999, before eventually returning to their classic thrash sound to date. The band has achieved worldwide sales of over two million units for combined sales of all their albums, making them one of the best-selling German thrash metal bands of all time. To date, Kreator has released thirteen studio albums, two EPs, one live album and three compilation albums. They gained a large underground fanbase in the international thrash metal community, and were one of the first German thrash metal bands to sign to a major label (Epic Records in 1988). However, Kreator would not have success until later albums, including their thirteenth studio album Phantom Antichrist (2012), which peaked at higher chart positions in many countries. The band has been working on a new album, which is due for release around 2017."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Nightwish is a symphonic metal band from Kitee, Finland. The band was formed in 1996 by lead songwriter and keyboardist Tuomas Holopainen, guitarist Emppu Vuorinen, and lead singer Tarja Turunen. The band soon picked up drummer Jukka Nevalainen, and then bassist Sami V\u00E4nsk\u00E4 after the release of their debut album, Angels Fall First (1997). In 2002, V\u00E4nsk\u00E4 was replaced by Marco Hietala, who also took over the male vocalist role previously filled by Holopainen or guest singers. Although Nightwish have been prominent in their home country since Angels Fall First, they did not achieve worldwide fame until the release of the albums Oceanborn (1998), Wishmaster (2000) and Century Child (2002). Their 2004 album, Once, has sold more than one million copies and was the band's breakthrough in the United States. Their biggest US hit single, \"Wish I Had an Angel\" (2004), received MTV airplay and was included on three US film soundtracks to promote their North American tour. The band produced three more singles and two music videos for Once, as well as a re-recording of \"Sleeping Sun\" for the \"best of\" compilation album, Highest Hopes (2005), before Turunen's dismissal in October 2005. Her last performance with Nightwish was during a concert recorded for the live album/DVD End of an Era. After the concert, the other members informed Turunen with an open letter that she was no longer a member of Nightwish. In May 2007, Nightwish announced Anette Olzon as Turunen's replacement. That September, the band released their sixth album, Dark Passion Play, which has sold almost 2 million copies. The album's lead single, \"Amaranth\", became one of Nightwish's most successful in Europe. The supporting tour, one of the band's largest, started on October 6, 2007 and ended on September 19, 2009. The band released an EP/live album, Made in Hong Kong (And in Various Other Places), in March 2009 as a CD/DVD, and their seventh studio album, Imaginaerum, was released globally on various days in late 2011/early 2012. On October 1, 2012, Nightwish announced that they had parted ways with Olzon and would be finishing the current tour with ReVamp and former After Forever vocalist Floor Jansen. In October 2013, Nightwish made Jansen and longtime session uillean pipes player Troy Donockley permanent members of the band, and they were featured in the acclaimed album Endless Forms Most Beautiful, released in March, 2015. Nightwish is the third-best-selling band and musical entity in Finland with certified sales of nearly 900,000 certified copies. The group is also the most successful Finnish band worldwide, selling more than 8 million records and receiving more than 60 gold and platinum awards, having released five Number 1 albums and thirteen Number 1 singles."@en ;

dbr:Nine_Inch_Nails	rdf:type	dbo:Band ;
	dbo:abstract	"Nine Inch Nails (abbreviated NIN; stylized as NI\u0418) is an American industrial rock band, founded in 1988 by Trent Reznor in Cleveland, Ohio. As its main producer, singer, songwriter, and instrumentalist, Reznor is the only official member of the group and remains solely responsible for its direction. Nine Inch Nails' music straddles a wide range of genres. After recording a new album, Reznor usually assembles a live band to perform with him. The touring band features a revolving lineup that often rearranges songs to fit a live setting. On stage, Nine Inch Nails often employs visual elements to accompany performances, which frequently include light shows. Underground music audiences warmly received Nine Inch Nails in its early years. Reznor produced several highly influential records in the 1990s that achieved widespread popularity: many Nine Inch Nails songs became radio hits; and their entire catalog has reached record sales exceeding over 20 million albums worldwide, with 10 million sales certified in the United States alone. In 1997, Reznor appeared in Time magazine's list of the year's most influential people, and Spin magazine described him as \"the most vital artist in music.\"In 2004, Rolling Stone placed Nine Inch Nails at 94 on its list of the 100 greatest artists of all time. Despite this acclaim, the band has had several feuds with the corporate side of the recording industry. In 2007, these corporate entanglements resulted in Reznor announcing that Nine Inch Nails would split from its label and release future material independently. Since 1989, Nine Inch Nails has released eight studio albums. After a hiatus from 2009 to 2013, Nine Inch Nails released Hesitation Marks, through Columbia Records. Prior to this, Ghosts I\u2013IV and The Slip were both independently released in digital form, with physical releases coming later. The digital release of the latter was made available completely free of charge, and the former, while also available for sale, can be acquired legally through means such as file-sharing due to its Creative Commons license. Nine Inch Nails has been nominated for thirteen Grammy Awards and won twice for the songs \"Wish\" and \"Happiness in Slavery\", in 1992 and 1996 respectively. In 2014, Nine Inch Nails was named as nominees for induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, their first year of eligibility. In 2015, they were nominated a second time."@en ;

Since its debut album in 1983, the band has released twelve studio albums, two live albums, a box set, six music videos, two extended plays and a cover album. Four of the band's studio albums have received gold certification in the United States. The band has received five Grammy nominations, winning one in 2007 for the song \"Eyes of the Insane\", and one in 2008 for the song \"Final Six\" (both from 2006's Christ Illusion). Slayer has also played at several music festivals worldwide, including Unholy Alliance, Download and Ozzfest. Slayer's musical style involves fast tremolo picking, double bass drumming, riffs in irregular scales and shouted vocals. In the original line-up, King, Hanneman, and lead vocalist/bassist Tom Araya contributed to the band's lyrics, and most of the band's music was written by King and Hanneman, with additional help from Araya and drummer Dave Lombardo. The band's lyrics and album art, which cover topics such as murder, serial killers, necrophilia, torture, genocide, human experimentation, Satanism, hate crimes, terrorism, religion, antireligion, Nazism, and warfare, have generated album bans, delays, lawsuits, and criticism from religious groups and the public. However, its music has been highly influential, often being cited by many bands as an influence musically, visually, and lyrically. Between 1991 and 2013, the band sold 4.9 million albums in the United States."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Supr\u00EAme NTM (or simply NTM) is a French hip hop group formed in 1989 in the Seine-Saint-Denis d\u00E9partement. The group comprises rappers Joey Starr (born Didier Morville) and Kool Shen (born Bruno Lopes). Their six albums were released by Sony Music Entertainment. The group takes its name from the French slang \"NTM\", an acronym for \"Nique Ta M\u00E8re\" (\"Nique\" is derived from the shortening of the French word forniquer (fornicate)) meaning \"fuck your mother\". Supreme NTM is known for their hostility towards the police, violent lyrics, and legal battles with the French authorities. Their musical style is predominantly hardcore rap, although later albums include funk, soul and reggae influences. The group is outspokenly critical of racism and class inequality in French society, and while their earlier music is violent, some of their later work, such as \"Pose ton Gun\" (\"Put down your Gun\"), is explicitly anti-violent. In 1998, the group released its last album of original material under the NTM moniker, as both Joey Starr and Kool Shen started their own labels, promoting new bands and branching out in other fields such as the clothing industry (2High is Kool Shen's brand, Com-8 is Joey Starr's). While officially the band still exists, and its well-known name was used in 2001 to promote a 'duel' album pitting the two labels' artists against each other, Kool Shen was quoted in 2004 saying \"on a fini avec NTM en 98\" (\"We finished with NTM in 1998\"). The group is known for its gritty, dark and sometimes violent lyrics, as well as for the contrast between the two rappers' styles. While Joey Starr (also known as Jaguar Gorgonne and Double-R) has a relatively slow flow, aggressive lyrics and a deep, booming voice (which he sometimes uses to yell such as in \"Pose ton Gun\"), Kool Shen has a funkier flow as well as witty and rather melancholic lyrics.[citation needed]"@en ;

They have spent a total of 180 weeks on the singles and albums charts combined as of 2012, and have accumulated 25 top 75 singles between 1997 and 2012. Feeder's music has been inspired by a wide variety of artists and styles, including The Police, Nirvana, and The Smashing Pumpkins. Their early material showcased a heavy rock sound reminiscent of grunge, but the band would later introduce more acoustic aspects into their music, including elements of pianos and string orchestras. The band was formed in 1992 under the name of \"Reel\" by vocalist and guitarist Grant Nicholas, drummer Jon Lee and bassist Simon Blight, three of the four members of Raindancer, after the departure of that band's other member, guitarist John Canham. However, Blight left Reel later in 1992, and the band played with many session bassists before hiring Taka Hirose in 1995, a year after the band signed with The Echo Label. Feeder garnered media attention in 2001 for their third album, Echo Park, and its lead single, \"Buck Rogers\", which later become a UK Top 5 single. In January 2002, Jon Lee committed suicide in his Miami home, after which the remaining members began to record and play with former Skunk Anansie drummer Mark Richardson. They released their fourth album, Comfort in Sound later that year, which touched on themes such as loss and coming to terms with death, while also exploring themes of positivity. Richardson was ultimately made an official member, remaining so until May 2009 when he returned to a reformed Skunk Anansie. Feeder employed Australian Damon Wilson and former Mexicolas drummer Tim Trotter for sessions and touring commitments for Renegades (2010), and they have since employed drummer Karl Brazil. Although the band have not had a top 10 release since 2008, they have still charted two more Top 20 albums, with the latest being 2012's Generation Freakshow."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"La\u010Dni Franz was a rock band from Slovenia that was also popular in the 1980s in Titoist Yugoslavia. While they were inspired by another Slovenian radical band Buldo\u017Eer known for utilizing sheer madness in the social and political satire, their lyrics is more self-ironic. The band was formed in Maribor in June 1979. Their name, meaning hungry Franz, is a pun on the name of a character from the novel Catch-22, Hungry Joe, and describes hunger for rock music. The band's music and attitude was a kind of laid back, and they portrayed themselves as a local band from a provincial town. Zoran Predin's lyrics ranged from disturbing ballads (Ne mi dihat za ovratnik, Lipa zelenela je), through love songs (\u010Cakaj me, Naj ti poljub nari\u0161e ustnice), to social and political satire (Praslovan, Na\u0161a Lidija je pri vojakih). The key band members were frontman and songwriter Zoran Predin, and guitarist Oto Rimele. The band made the most creative success by the end of the 1980s, with classical albums such as Ikebana, Adijo pamet, Ne mi dihat za ovratnik, and Na svoji strani (the last one made with the original crew). Their last studio album was released in 1994. La\u010Dni Franz officially ceased to exist in 1997 after a series of compilation albums. Zoran Predin continued solo career after the Franz disbanded. Many band's hits, such as Praslovan, Bog nima telefona, Vaterpolist, Ne mi dihat za ovratnik, \u010Cakaj me or Naj ti poljub nari\u0161e ustnice, have remained in his concert repertoire. The band briefly regathered in winter 2005 - 2006, and held a series of concerts in Slovenia, Belgrade, and Zagreb."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Criteria is an indie rock band from Omaha, Nebraska, formed in 2003 when ex-Cursive founding member Steve Pedersen returned to his hometown after graduating from the Duke University School of Law. He spent six months in a friend's basement where he wrote all ten songs for his new project's debut album. He recruited the help of some old friends, A.J. Mogis (of Presto! Recording Studios and Lullaby for the Working Class) on bass guitar, Aaron Druery on guitar, and Mike Sweeney of Beep Beep on drums. Their first album, En Garde, was released on his previous band's label, Initial Records. Steve Pedersen eventually got a day job as a lawyer, making it hard for the band to go on tour to promote their new album. Initial Records went bankrupt about a year after, leaving Criteria without a label. Saddle Creek Records took their longtime friend in and put out three releases in 2005. The first was a re-release of the overlooked and underrated En Garde, their new single, \"Prevent the World,\" and their second full-length, When We Break. After being moved into Saddle Creek, Pedersen quit his day job to spend full-time making music and touring. Criteria has performed with bands such as Cursive, The Fall of Troy, Thunderbirds Are Now!, Statistics, Poison the Well, Rahim (band), and Minus the Bear.

	dbo:abstract	"The Greyboy Allstars are a jazz band who released their fourth album, Inland Emperor, in 2013. The band came together in 1994, when a select group of musicians were asked to perform at a record release party for the landmark acid jazz and club staple \u201CFreestylin\u201D by San Diego\u2019s DJ Greyboy, who was well known for spinning `70s soul and funk. The group enjoyed playing together, and decided to continue on as a band. The Greyboy Allstars started playing weekly at San Diego\u2019s now defunct Green Circle, weekends at San Francisco\u2019s Elbo Room and various clubs throughout Europe. By playing danceable boogaloo music within the soul and jazz genres, they became very popular both nationally and internationally. The lineup of the band remains nearly the same, with Karl Denson on horns and vocals, Robert Walter on keyboards, Elgin Park (aka Michael Andrews) on guitars and vocals, and Chris Stillwell on bass. Original drummer Zak Najor was replaced by Aaron Redfield, an old friend of the band and frequent collaborator. While DJ Greyboy is no longer a member of the band, he remains a central figure in their artistic output, having introduced the band to many of the records that inspire their sound, produced their first album and appeared on 2007\u2032s What Happened to Television? Individual members of the group have gone on to score film and television shows, work with platinum artists and bands both on the road and in the studio, and head their own solo projects.[citation needed] For Inland Emperor, they worked out the arrangements during the recording, which took place live over just a few sessions at Elgin Park\u2019s studio in Glendale, CA. Denson says of this accelerated pace of creation, \u201CWe do in one week would take me two months to do in any other situation.\u201D Grammy Award-winning producer/engineer Mickey Petralia (Beck, Peaches, Eels, Flight of the Conchords) mixed the tracks."@en ;

dbr:Army_of_the_Pharaohs	rdf:type	dbo:Band ;
	dbo:abstract	"Army of the Pharaohs (most commonly abbreviated as AOTP or A.O.T.P.) is an American underground hip hop collective originating from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, formed by Jedi Mind Tricks MC Vinnie Paz in 1998. The group has strong links to other underground groups such as; OuterSpace, Snowgoons, La Coka Nostra, Demigodz and Jedi Mind Tricks. It has changed several times ever since its formation. Paz formed the outfit in the late 1990s with the original roster of Bahamadia, Chief Kamachi, Virtuoso, 7L & Esoteric, plus Jedi Mind Tricks' other member Stoupe the Enemy of Mankind. The group first released the \"Five Perfect Exertions\" and \"War Ensemble\" 12\" on Paz's short-lived Recordings in 1998, but then the underground supergroup remained silent for several years. After a couple of successful Jedi Mind Tricks albums and a new deal with Babygrande by 2003, Paz resurrected the crew, adding OuterSpace, Celph Titled, Reef the Lost Cauze, King Syze, Des Devious, and Apathy; however, Stoupe, Bahamadia, and Virtuoso had defected from the group. Babygrande issued their \"Tear It Down\" 12\" and first album, The Torture Papers, in 2006. The 2007 follow-up album, Ritual of Battle, saw Jus Allah and JMT prot\u00E9g\u00E9s Doap Nixon and Demoz joining the Pharaohs. The Unholy Terror was released on March 30, 2010. This album marked the return of Apathy and the addition of two new AOTP members, Block McCloud Journalist. Two songs, \"Godzilla\" and \"Contra Mantra\", were released before the album. This album also marked the departure of Chief Kamachi who left the group because of business issues and an apparent feud with Vinnie Paz & Apathy. In early 2011, Vinnie Paz announced on his Facebook page that In Death Reborn is due to be released in 2012, however the date was pushed back and almost seemed like it was never going to be released. Early in 2012, Houston underground MC Zilla and Connecticut's Blacastan were added to the group. Both artists have made names for themselves with their features and album releases in 2012. In Death Reborn was eventually released on April 22, 2014. The album featured members Vinnie Paz, Apathy, Blacastan, Block McCloud, Celph Titled, Demoz, Des Devious, Doap Nixon, Esoteric, Lawrence Arnell, King Magnetic, King Syze, OuterSpace, Reef the Lost Cauze and Zilla. Their fifth studio album, Heavy Lies the Crown was released on October 21, 2014."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Augie March are an Australian indie/pop rock band. Formed in 1996 in Shepparton, Victoria, the band currently consists of vocalist and rhythm guitarist Glenn Richards, lead guitarist Adam Donovan, bassist Edmondo Ammendola, drummer David Williams, and keyboardist Kiernan Box. Box replaced Rob Dawson, the band's initial piano player, who died in 2001. Augie March's rise to fame was slow; their first two EPs failed to make an impact on the market, despite Waltz being nominated for two ARIA Awards. Their first album, Sunset Studies, was released in 2000. Despite poor sales, it was critically acclaimed and received an ARIA Award nomination. Critics in both Australia and the United States also lauded its 2002 successor, Strange Bird, but it sold and charted poorly in both countries. Augie March's third album, Moo, You Bloody Choir (2006), received a much better reception in terms of sales; its lead single \"One Crowded Hour\" attained critical acclaim and appeared on the ARIA Charts at number 29, while the album was nominated for numerous ARIA Awards and won an Australian Music Prize. Having achieved mainstream success, the band toured Australia and the United States regularly through 2006 and 2007. In 2008 they released their fourth album, Watch Me Disappear. It became their most commercially successful album, but received the least favourable critical reception. Augie March's distinctive musical style is directed by songwriter and vocalist Richards. His lyrics often draw critical acclaim for their poetic style. The band's music is generally described as intricate, lush, and dense, acting as a backdrop for Richards' complex and poetic vocals."@en ;

The project's first EP, V\u00EAn, was released in 2003. V\u00EAn was a studio project of Glanzmann's, but its success led to the recruitment of a full band. The band then released a full-length album, Spirit, in June 2006. In November 2007, Eluveitie was signed by Nuclear Blast. The group rose to fame following the release of their first major-label album, Slania, in February 2008. The album peaked at number 35 in the Swiss charts and number 72 in the German charts. Eluveitie describe themselves as \"The new wave of folk metal\". The band's style incorporates characteristics of melodic death metal combined with the melodies of traditional Celtic music. They use traditional European instruments, including the hurdy-gurdy and bagpipes, amidst guitars and both clean and harsh vocals. Their lyrics include references to Celtic mythology, particularly the Celtic Gaul village. The lyrics are often in the extinct ancient language Gaulish. The name of the band comes from graffiti on a vessel from Mantua (ca. 300 BC). The inscription in Etruscan letters reads eluveitie, which has been interpreted as the Etruscan form of the Celtic (h)elvetios (\u201Cthe Helvetian\u201D), presumably referring to a man of Helvetian descent living in Mantua."@en ;

Since that time, DC Talk has been on an indefinite hiatus, and the three band members all have led solo careers. They performed and recorded individual songs together several times during the 2000s, although the group never officially reunited or disbanded. The group's musical style evolved significantly throughout its career. Its first two releases, DC Talk and Nu Thang, were of the hip hop genre. DC Talk's third album, Free at Last, also mainly took influence from the hip hop style, although the group's music began taking on a rock sound.

Following its release, Doran departed from the band and was replaced by Dan Andriano. The band subsequently recorded an EP, For Your Lungs Only (1998), and its debut studio album, Goddamnit (1998).

Good Mourning marked the recording debut of current drummer Derek Grant. In 2005, the band released Crimson which expanded upon the band's punk rock influences, with prominent overdubs and additional instrumentation, and continued with this direction on Agony & Irony (2008), which was released on V2 Records. In 2010, the band released This Addiction on its own label Heart & Skull and Epitaph. Recorded in the band's home town of Chicago, with early producer Matt Allison, the album was a conscious effort by the band to return to their punk rock roots; it became the highest charting album of their career, debuting on the Billboard 200 at No. 11. In 2011, the band celebrated its 15-year anniversary with the release of Damnesia, which featured new, acoustic-based recordings of songs from across the band's career. The band's eighth studio album, My Shame Is True, was released on April 2, 2013."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Ash is a Northern Irish alternative rock band, formed in Downpatrick in 1992 by vocalist and guitarist Tim Wheeler, bassist Mark Hamilton and drummer Rick McMurray. As a three-piece, they released mini-album Trailer in 1994, followed by 1977 in 1996. This 1996 release was named by NME as one of the 500 greatest albums of all time. After the success of their full debut the band recruited Charlotte Hatherley as a guitarist and vocalist, releasing their second record Nu-Clear Sounds in 1998. After narrowly avoiding bankruptcy the band released Free All Angels in 2001 and a string of successful singles. Their fourth record Meltdown, released in 2004, was the band's final record with Hatherley before returning to their original three-piece lineup for their fifth studio album Twilight of the Innocents in 2007. After five conventional albums the band released 26 singles in The A-Z Series in 2009, one every two weeks. The band have had one silver, two gold and two platinum-selling (and chart-topping) records in the United Kingdom, as well as 18 songs in the top 40 of the UK Singles Chart. In 2015, they released a sixth studio album, entitled Kablammo!. They were associated with Britpop, though as that musical movement emphasised Britishness which is a controversial state in Northern Ireland, they were not comfortable with the association."@en ;

Sick of It All has been a major part of the New York hardcore scene. Though their 1989 debut album Blood, Sweat and No Tears was a moderate success, Sick of It All did not achieve commercial success until further albums. After the release of their 1992 second album Just Look Around, East West Records saw the band's potential and signed them in 1993. Sick of It All's third and major label debut album, Scratch the Surface, was released in 1994 to critical acclaim, and included the singles \"Scratch the Surface\" and \"Step Down\" (the video for the latter single would also be featured in the 1995 Beavis and Butt-head episode \"Premature Evacuation\"). Their 1997 follow-up Built to Last was also highly acclaimed. Despite the success of Built to Last, Sick of It All was dropped from East West and signed to Fat Wreck Chords in 1998, who released the band's next three albums before being dropped from the label in 2005, when they signed to Abacus Records, a subsidiary of Century Media. This label released their eighth studio album Death to Tyrants in 2006 to positive reviews (Abacus eventually went out of business, though Sick of It All would remain on Century Media, which released the band's next three albums).

They rose to prominence during the early 1970s with 17 consecutive top 20 hits and six number ones. The British Hit Singles & Albums names them as the most successful British group of the 1970s based on sales of singles. They were the first act to achieve three singles enter at number one; all six of the band's chart-toppers were penned by Noddy Holder and Jim Lea. Total UK sales stand at 6,520,171, and their best-selling single, \"Merry Xmas Everybody\", has sold in excess of one million copies. Following an unsuccessful move to the United States in 1975, Slade's popularity waned but was unexpectedly revived in 1980 when they were last minute replacements for Ozzy Osbourne at the Reading Rock Festival. The band later acknowledged this to have been one of the highlights of their career. The original line up split in 1992 but the band reformed the following year as Slade II. The band has continued, with a number of line-up changes, to the present day. They have now shortened the group name back to Slade. A number of diverse artists have cited Slade as an influence, including alternative rock icons Nirvana and the Smashing Pumpkins, punk pioneers the Ramones, Sex Pistols, the Undertones, the Runaways and the Clash, glam metal bands Kiss, M\u00F6tley Cr\u00FCe, Twisted Sister, Quiet Riot, Poison and Def Leppard and pop-rock stalwarts the Replacements, Cheap Trick and Oasis.

dbr:Nashville_Pussy	rdf:type	dbo:Band ;
	dbo:abstract	"Nashville Pussy is an American rock & roll band from Atlanta, Georgia. Their musical style has been variously described as psychobilly, Southern rock, hard rock and cowpunk, as well as \"sleaze rock\". The band's lyrical themes mostly revolve around sex, drugs, drinking, fighting, and rock 'n' roll. Initially called Hell's Half-Acre, the band's name comes from Ted Nugent's introduction to \"Wang Dang Sweet Poontang\" on the Double Live Gonzo album. Following the initial 1997 breakup of Kentucky cowpunk band Nine Pound Hammer, guitarist Blaine Cartwright formed Nashville Pussy where he would take up vocal duties in addition to guitar. The core lineup of Nashville Pussy consists of husband-and-wife duo Blaine Cartwright and Ruyter Suys (pronounced \"Rider Sighs\"), and drummer Jeremy Thompson. Original drummer Adam Neal (Nine Pound Hammer) left to form The Hookers. Original bassist Corey Parks (sister of former NBA basketball player Cherokee Parks) quit one month after the release of the album High as Hell, and later joined Die Hunns. Tracy Almazan aka Tracy Kickass formerly of NYC's The Wives, and Helldorado was enlisted to replace Parks mid-tour. Nashville Pussy recorded Say Something Nasty with Almazan on bass only to be replaced by Katielyn Campbell (of the band Famous Monsters). Katie Lynn's image is on the album Say Something Nasty. Campbell was subsequently replaced by Karen Cuda for the album Get Some. Karen Cuda also appeared as bassist on the album \"From Hell To Texas\", and in the live DVD Live in Hollywood. Nashville Pussy have released six full-length studio albums, one EP and two live DVDs."@en ;

The band was one of the most popular and most influential acts of the Yugoslav rock scene. Riblja \u010Corba was formed in 1978 by vocalist Bora \u0110or\u0111evi\u0107, guitarist Rajko Koji\u0107, bass guitarist Mi\u0161a Aleksi\u0107 and drummer Vicko Milatovi\u0107. Their debut release, the single \"Lutka sa naslovne strane\" (1978), saw huge success and launched them to fame. They were soon joined by guitarist Mom\u010Dilo Bajagi\u0107 \"Bajaga\", the new lineup releasing the album Kost u grlu (1979), which was, largely due to \u0110or\u0111evi\u0107's social-related lyrics, a huge commercial and critical success. Their following releases, Pokvarena ma\u0161ta i prljave strasti (1981), Mrtva priroda (1981) and Buvlja pijaca (1982) launched them to the top of the Yugoslav rock scene; \u0110or\u0111evi\u0107's provocative social- and political-related lyrics were praised by the critics and often caused media scandals. In the mid 1980s, the band saw a slight decline in popularity, but made a triumphant comeback with the album Istina (1985), recorded with new guitar duo, Vidoja \"D\u017Eind\u017Eer\" Bo\u017Einovi\u0107 and Nikola \u010Cuturilo. Until the end of the decade and breakup of Yugoslavia, the band managed to sustain their popularity, but after the beginning of Yugoslav wars it heavily declined in Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina, due to \u0110or\u0111evi\u0107's support for Serbian nationalism. However, \u0110or\u0111evi\u0107 also opposed the regime of Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107, demonstrating his attitude on the albums Riblja \u010Corba recorded during the 1990s. Since the beginning of the 2000s, the band manages to remain one of the top acts of the Serbian rock scene, although the albums they released during the 2000s and 2010s saw little critical success."@en ;

The band's fifth member is drummer Matt Cameron (also of Soundgarden), who has been with the band since 1998. Boom Gaspar (piano) has also been a session/touring member with the band since 2002. Drummers Dave Krusen, Matt Chamberlain, Dave Abbruzzese and Jack Irons are former members of the band. Formed after the demise of Gossard and Ament's previous band, Mother Love Bone, Pearl Jam broke into the mainstream with its debut album, Ten, in 1991. One of the key bands in the grunge movement of the early 1990s, over the course of the band's career, its members became noted for their refusal to adhere to traditional music industry practices, including refusing to make proper music videos or give interviews, and engaging in a much-publicized boycott of Ticketmaster. In 2006, Rolling Stone described the band as having \"spent much of the past decade deliberately tearing apart their own fame.\" To date, the band has sold nearly 32 million records in the U.S. and an estimated 60 million worldwide. Pearl Jam has outlasted and outsold many of its contemporaries from the alternative rock breakthrough of the early 1990s, and is considered one of the most influential bands of that decade. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic referred to Pearl Jam as \"the most popular American rock & roll band of the '90s.\""@en ;

As a teenager, Roach reportedly spent a number of months under the tutelage of cult blues guitarist Washboard Williams; however this rumor has never been properly substantiated, and Roach's playing style does not suggest such tutelage. After attending college in Virginia, Roach lived in several different cities on the east coast of the United States before moving to San Francisco. The move to San Francisco was a turning point for Roach's musical career. There he met and befriended musicians like Tom Meshishnik, Todd Sickafoose, Sean Hayes and Noe Venable. The musical impact that these relationships had on Roach can be heard on Dogwood Winter, his first studio album. The album was jointly produced by Meshishnik and Sickafoose, and features Venable on backing vocals on several tracks."@en ;

After these two unsuccessful albums, the band returned to their native language and released their so-called comeback album Uusi Aalto (1999, New Wave). On August 13, 2007 it was announced on the band\u2019s official website that the group retreats to spend a quiet life for an indefinite period, and they made their so far last public appearance in August 17. The band\u2019s future is completely open, any plans for recordings, concerts or other activities has not been established. 2011 they played on the Ilosaarirock-Festival in Joensuu. On January 4, 2012 it was announced on the band\u00B4s Facebook-Fanpage that the group started recording their 13th album."@en ;

Their debut album goes by the same name. Since their rise to prominence after starring in the 2007 film Once, they increasingly referred to themselves as \"The Swell Season\" in promotion of their performances until it became the formal name of their collaboration in 2008. (Notably, they still used their separate names when they contributed their cover of Bob Dylan's \"You Ain't Goin' Nowhere\" to the 2007 soundtrack of I'm Not There.) From 2007 through 2010, a documentary film was made about Irglova and Hansard called The Swell Season. The documentary premiered at the Tribeca Film Festival in June 2011 to positive reviews."@en ;

dbr:Act-i-vate	rdf:type	dbo:Band ;
	dbo:abstract	"ACT-I-VATE is an American webcomics collective based on an original idea by Dean Haspiel and founded by Haspiel and seven other cartoonists. It started out on the blogging platform Livejournal, but has now moved to its own dedicated website. The ACT-I-VATE collective features serialized graphic novels from over twenty-five hand-picked professional cartoonists (each of whom generally adds a new episode weekly), and is updated daily. ACT-I-VATE's artists are unpaid, and produce their work without editorial oversight. ACT-I-VATE is also free to view. In addition to the high-quality comics, the site is known for its vocal community of readers and the lengthy discussion threads between artist and reader. ACT-I-VATE debuted on February 1, 2006, with eight cartoonists, and added four more members on April 5, 2006. Since then, the collective has added new hand-picked cartoonists at a regular rate to achieve its current membership. ACT-I-VATE rose to prominence when many of its artists, including Haspiel, Michel Fiffe, Mike Cavallaro, Dan Goldman, and Nick Bertozzi, began to receive publishing deals. Haspiel and Fiffe's three-issue mini-series, Brawl, a \"creature romance double feature\" featuring Haspiel's \"Immortal\" (starring Billy Dogma) and Fiffe's \"Panorama,\" which both originated on ACT-I-VATE, was published by Image Comics in the Fall of 2007. Similarly, Parade (with Fireworks), by Mike Cavallaro, began on ACT-I-VATE, was first excerpted in New York Magazine, and later published by Image. Other ACT-I-VATE members, such as Nikki Cook, Josh Neufeld, and Leland Purvis, are currently working on projects which in large parts came from their ACT-I-VATE work."@en ;

dbr:Botellita_de_Jerez	rdf:type	dbo:Band ;
	dbo:abstract	"Botellita de Jerez was a Mexican rock band, formed in Mexico City in 1982. Their music is a fusion of rock, cumbia, and Mexican traditional music like mariachi and son, creating the genre called guacarrock (rock and guacamole). The band was always distinguished by a festive and irreverent musical fusion, celebrating the culture of the nacos and integrating sketches and albures in its lyrics and concerts. Its style, standard rock, was combined with satirical lyrics that portrayed urban life and popular culture in Mexico City. In their song \"Guaca Rock de la Malinche\", they coined the phrase Todo lo naco es chido (Everything tacky is cool), trying to re-vindicate the popular culture of the lower socio-economic classes. Botellita de Jerez pioneered a lot of trends from contemporary art in Mexico and the United States, since it incorporated motifs from popular use, such as lucha libre, popular dances and slang, which are now commonly used among the upper classes as well. The name of the band comes from a Mexican saying used as rebuttal in an argument: \"Botellita de jerez, todo lo que me digas, ser\u00E1 al rev\u00E9s\", which literally means: \"Bottle of sherry, all you say to me will be otherwise\" However, the equivalent English idiom is: \"I'm rubber, you're glue, whatever you say bounces off me and sticks to you.\" One of their most notable songs is \"Ni\u00F1a de mis ojos\" included in the LP of the same name, which has been released on the albums \"El Ultimo Guacarrock\" and \"Superespecial Un Plug\". The signature songs of Botellita de Jerez are \"Guacarrock\", \"El Guaca Rock de la Malinche\", \"Alarmala de Tos\", \"Oh Denny's\" and \"Abuelita de Batman\" (The Granny of Batman) which became the first cumbia-rock of the rock band, the song is notable for its parody-music video filmed in Colonia Santa Mar\u00EDa la Ribera in Mexico City."@en ;

With more than 300 singing members, it is also one of the largest. The chorus\u2019 stated mission is that it \u201Cdelights audiences and champions gay equality with robust artistry, fun, and surprise.\u201D In addition to singing members, GMCW has nearly 100 support volunteers, 400 subscribers, 500 donors and an annual audience of nearly 10,000. The parent organization is the Federal City Performing Arts Association, Inc., and GMCW is a member of GALA Choruses. The chorus was established in 1981 by enthusiasts of the San Francisco Gay Men\u2019s Chorus who attended a local performance at the Kennedy Center Concert Hall. In the time since its founding, GMCW has performed locally at the Kennedy Center, the National Theatre, the Warner Theatre, DAR Constitution Hall, the Lincoln Theatre and, most frequently, Lisner Auditorium at George Washington University. The chorus performed at President Clinton\u2019s second inauguration in 1997. In 1998, the chorus toured three Scandinavian capitals. While there, GMCW was received by Sweden\u2019s Princess Christina to thank members for singing in support of Noah\u2019s Ark, a Swedish AIDS services organization. During its 20th-anniversary season in 2000\u20132001, GMCW performed at Carnegie Hall and Boston\u2019s Symphony Hall in joint concerts with the gay men\u2019s choruses of Boston and New York City. In December 2002, GMCW performed as part of the televised 25th annual Kennedy Center Honors in tribute to Elizabeth Taylor. The chorus has commissioned original works for men\u2019s chorus, such as Changing Hearts in 2004 and Songs of My Family in 2007. Both works were featured on CD releases subsequent to their inaugural performances on stage. GMCW performs three subscription concerts annually: holiday-themed (December), spring (March) and summer (June), which opens Washington\u2019s annual week-long Capital Pride celebration. In addition, in 2007 and 2008, the chorus performed a non-subscription concert of classical fare in February, between the holiday and spring concerts. There are occasional smaller, also non-subscription productions, such as an auditioned Cabaret concert in October or November. The chorus makes appearances at local community events, including programs for PFLAG, Whitman-Walker Clinic and the Human Rights Campaign. The chorus sponsors two small ensembles: Potomac Fever, an a cappella close-harmony group, and Rock Creek Singers, a chamber choir. These ensembles serve as representatives of the larger chorus at community functions, and each produces an annual concert. The records of the GMCW are cared for by the Special Collections Research Center in the Estelle and Melvin Gelman Library of the George Washington University."@en ;

The group was conceived by record producer Igor Matviyenko, and initially consisted of Andrei Grigoriev-Apollonov, Kirill Andreev, and primary vocalist Igor Sorin. They performed under several names (such as \"Apollo-Soyuz\") before settling on \"Ivanushki International\", a name meant to represent their intended blend of Russian (\"Little Ivans\") and international influences, and itself written half in Cyrillic, half in the Latin alphabet, with the second word read as in English. Their debut album, \u041A\u043E\u043D\u0435\u0447\u043D\u043E \u043E\u043D (Konyechno on, Of Course It's Him), was released in 1996. It included three cover versions of songs from the 1980s \u2013 \"\u0412\u0441\u0435\u043B\u0435\u043D\u043D\u0430\u044F\" (Vselennaya, \"The Universe\"), originally performed by Alexander Ivanov, and \"\u0420\u043E\u043D\u0434\u043E\" (Rondo, \"Roundabout\"), \"\u042D\u0442\u0430\u0436\u0438\" (Etazhi, \"Levels\"), and \"\u041C\u0430\u043B\u0438\u043D\u0430\" (\"Malina\", \"Rasberry\") by the group Class. However, it contained several original songs, including the hits \"\u0422\u0443\u0447\u0438\" (Tuchi, \"Clouds\"), \"\u041A\u043E\u043B\u0435\u0447\u043A\u043E\" (Kolechko, \"The Ring\"), \"\u0413\u0434\u0435-\u0442\u043E\" (Gdye-to, \"Somewhere\"), and \"\u041E\u043D\u0430\" (Ona, \"She\"). A remixed version of the album followed one year later, Konyechno on remixed. The remixes were created by Lubeh keyboardist Igor Polonsky, Moral Code X keyboardist Konstantin Smirnov, and DJ Maxim Milyutenko. Alongside the remixed versions, the album contained the new hit \"\u041A\u0443\u043A\u043B\u0430\" (Kukla, \"Doll\") and a cover version of the Lubeh song \"\u0414\u0443\u0441\u044F\" (Dusya). Ivanushki's second studio album, \u0422\u0432\u043E\u0438 \u043F\u0438\u0441\u044C\u043C\u0430 (Tvoi pisma, Your Letters), released later in 1997, repeated the existing formula of original material and covers of past hits. It also included an audio letter from the group. Later that year, Igor Sorin left to pursue a solo career, and was replaced by Oleg Yakovlev, who had appeared in the music video for \"Doll\".
