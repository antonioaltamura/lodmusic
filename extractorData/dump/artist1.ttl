	dbo:abstract	"Frederique Trunk was born in Colmar, France and graduated in 1986 from the Conservatoire de Music de Strasbourg with honors in piano, ear training and theory. She earned a Certificate of Chamber Music and Sight Reading and graduated with a diploma in musicology from the Universite des Sciences Humaines de Strasbourg. In 1992, Frederique went to New York City to study jazz piano and harmony at the New School's Jazz and Contemporary Music Program with Kenny Werner, Fred Hersch and Maria Schneider. She has studied jazz piano and composition privately Art Resnick, Richie Beirach and Kirk Nurock as well as William Allaudin Mathieu and perfected her classical piano technique and teaching skills with Madeline Bruser. As a soloist and bandleader, Frederique has toured in Europe, Japan, Morocco, The United States, Canada and most recently, Barcelona, Spain. She has worked with, and been influenced by many musical combinations from solo piano to quartets as well as larger groups such as salsa bands and chamber orchestras. In 1996, Frederique formed a duet with Lebanese pianist Ramzi Moufarej. A year later they formed the musical collaboration Myriade. Using an unusual combination of two pianos, cello, the oud and percussion, their album Soukoun was released in the spring of 2001. In 1998 she formed her subsequent group, Frederique's Trio which presented a blend of Jazz standards and French songs. She completed her first album Secret Love in December 1999. In 2006 she released her Paris, New York...and Elsewhere. In addition to writing for her Jazz trio and Myriade, Fr\u00E9d\u00E9rique has been composing works for small ensembles and orchestra combining Classical and Jazz concepts enriched by her diverse interests and influences. Paysages Mouvants (Moving Landscapes), her piece for orchestra and Jazz trio, debuted to an enthusiastic audience in Florence Gould Hall at the New York French Institute Alliance Fran\u00E7aise, March 19, 2000. The Florence Gould Foundation then commissioned her to create another orchestral piece, Ombres et Miroirs (Shadows and Reflections), for strings, piano and percussion, that premiered February 6, 2002 at Weill Recital Hall, Carnegie Hall, New York City. A new piece ordered by Jean Pierre Schmitt -director of the French American Conservatory in New York- ESPERA, Ballad for alto saxophone and chamber orchestra was premiered with saxophonist Javier Oviedo (www.ovittmusic.com) in November 2010 at St Peter Church in New York. In January 1999, Fr\u00E9d\u00E9rique was the composer and musical director for the La Mama production, The Banquet of the Beheaded, a play by Nicola L. In December 2000, she composed and performed her first film score for The Sandman. David Teague's silent film, based on the tale by E.T.A. Hoffman, won First Prize at The New York International Independent Film and Video Festival in 2001. The complete score was released on CD in September 2001. Fr\u00E9d\u00E9rique has been teaching classical & jazz Piano, improvisation, music theory, harmony and composition in various music schools in France, privately, and from 1993 to 2006, at the French American Conservatory of Music at Carnegie Hall, New York, NY. In May 2006, she moved to Barcelona, Spain to explore more horizons and continue to transform both her music and herself. At the beginning of 2008 she formed the group \"Resonessence\" (inspired by the concept of the group Myriade she had in New York) who's essence is to create a unified sound made of many voices and different cultural influences with an unusual instrumentation: piano & voice, oud, clarinet & bass clarinet, cello and percussion. (www.myspace.com/resonessence)In the same idea of fusion of styles, she wrote an arrangement for piano and voice of the Livre Vermeil de Montserrat (Catalan medieval music) inspired by jazz and contemporary music, which she performed at the International Jazz Festival of Barcelona in November 2008.In 2009 Fr\u00E9d\u00E9rique started collaborating with tapdancer Roxane Butterfly for the project \"Mood Danza\" performed at the Festival Arte Donne in Turino, and at the Festival Mediterraneo in Genova (Italy). A new version of the show was presented at Joe\u2019s Pub in New York, July 31, 2010. Fr\u00E9d\u00E9rique is now back in France, living in Toulouse since September 2011, where she created a new Resonessence group, while still collaborating on projects in Barcelona, and New York and participating in news creations in Paris. She is regularly performing on the Toulouse scene at Cave Po\u00E9sie, the Mandala jazz club, Pause Musicale, Espace St Cyprien, Espace Job, and was part of the 2013 Jazz sur son 31 Festival.

She returned to France and worked as a nurse until she achieved success with \"Le Pull-over blanc.\" The song was first covered by Arno Hintjens in 1990, then by Alexandre Balduzzi and Nolwenn Leroy of Star Academy on the Fait sa Boum album in 2003.

Cudi first gained major recognition following the release of his first official full-length project, a mixtape titled A Kid Named Cudi (2008). The mixtape caught the attention of American rapper-producer Kanye West, who subsequently signed Cudi to his GOOD Music label imprint in late 2008. Cudi has since gone on to launch his own record label imprints, the now-dissolved Dream On and current independent label, Wicked Awesome Records. Initially a rapper, Cudi has since added singer, songwriter, record producer, guitarist, music video director and film composer, to his repertoire. As of 2015, Cudi has released five studio albums as a solo artist. In 2008, his debut single \"Day 'n' Nite\", led him to prominence, reaching the top five of the Billboard charts. Cudi's debut album Man on the Moon: The End of Day (2009) was later certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). In 2010, he released Man on the Moon II: The Legend of Mr. Rager, which was preceded by \"Erase Me\" and \"Mr. Rager\". Later in 2010, Cudi formed a rock band, now known as WZRD, with his long-time collaborator Dot da Genius, releasing one eponymous debut album, in early 2012. The album debuted at number one on the Top Rock Albums chart. In April 2013, Cudi released Indicud, which became his highest-charting album on multiple charts. In February 2014, Cudi unexpectedly released his fourth album, Satellite Flight: The Journey to Mother Moon, exclusively to digital retailers with no promotion. Kid Cudi has sold over 5.2 million digital singles and has worked with numerous prominent artists in the music industry, including Jay Z, Mary J. Blige, David Guetta, MGMT, Shakira, Snoop Dogg and Michael Bolton, among others. With his originality and creativity, as well as the emotion he conveys in his music, Cudi has amassed a large cult-like following among high school students, college students and stoners alike. In 2010, Cudi ventured into acting when he began starring in the HBO series How to Make It in America. Cudi has since appeared in several feature films, including Goodbye World, Need for Speed and Entourage. In addition, he has made appearances on television shows such as One Tree Hill, The Cleveland Show and Brooklyn Nine-Nine. In 2015, he became the bandleader on the IFC series, Comedy Bang!

The single \"Paper Planes\" peaked in the Top 20 worldwide and reached number four on the Billboard Hot 100. \"Paper Planes\" was certified gold in New Zealand and three times platinum in Canada and the US where, as of November 2011, it is ranked the seventh best-selling song by a British artist in the digital era. It has become XL Recordings' second best-selling single to date. M.I.A.'s third album Maya was released in 2010 soon after the controversial song-film short \"Born Free\". This became her highest-charting album in the UK and the US, reaching number nine on the Billboard 200, topping the Dance/Electronic Albums chart and debuting in the Top 10 in Finland, Norway, Greece and Canada. The single \"XXXO\" reached the Top 40 in Belgium, Spain and the UK. M.I.A. has embarked on five global headlining tours and is the founder of her own multimedia label, N.E.E.T.. Her fourth studio album, Matangi, was released in 2013. Arulpragasam's early compositions relied heavily on the Roland MC-505 music sequencer and drum machine. Her later work marked an evolution in her sound with rare instruments, electronics and unusual sound samples. Critics have acclaimed a distinctive style to her music. Lyrically incorporating a range of political, social, philosophical and cultural references that have defied existing pop music conventions, Arulpragasam was one of the first acts to come to public attention through the internet. She posted many of her songs and videos from 2002 onwards on platforms such as MySpace. In 2001, she received an \"Alternative\" Turner Prize nomination for her visual art. In 2005 and 2008, M.I.A. was artist of the year by Spin and URB and Arulpragasam is named as one of the defining artists of the 2000s decade by Rolling Stone in its \"Best of the Decade\" list in December 2009. Time magazine named her one of the world's 100 most influential people in 2009. Esquire magazine ranked M.I.A. on its list of the 75 most influential people of the 21st century in January 2010."@en .

	dbo:abstract	"Nicholas \"Nick\" Barber (born 31 August 1968), better known by the stage name Doof, is best known as a London-based psychedelic trance musician. Doof's first official release was in 1993 with NovaMute, the dance label run by Mute Records, a 3-track EP titled \"Disposable Hymns to the Infinite\". It was through Novamute label-mates Juno Reactor and Ben Watkins that Doof was first introduced to producer Youth (of Killing Joke/ Brilliant), Simon Posford, also known as Hallucinogen, and the Dragonfly Records label. Doof went on to release \"Double Dragons\" as a 12\" with Dragonfly in 1994, and to produce a series of tracks in partnership with Simon Posford, including \"Let's Turn On\", \"Born Again\" and \"Angelic Particles\". It was through his friendship with Simon Posford that Doof was introduced to Raja Ram (Shpongle/The Infinity Project/Quintessence) who later that year would start the highly influential trance label T.I.P Records. Doof's \"Let's Turn On\" (co-produced with Simon Posford) became the second ever T.I.P 12\" release. This was followed in 1995 by another 12\" for T.I.P (Angelina/Weird Karma), the Born Again EP on Matsuri and another 12\" for Dragonfly (\"Youth of the Galaxy\"). 1995 also saw numerous Doof remixes, including tracks by Hallucinogen and The Infinity Project. In 1996 the first Doof album Let's Turn On was released on T.I.P. Records, and went on to become one of the defining albums of the early psy-trance sound. It was subsequently re-released in 2000 by Twisted Records, who also released the second Doof album It's About Time the same year. During this time Doof travelled extensively performing live sets all over the globe including numerous appearances across Europe, in the U.S, South America and Japan. In 2001 he teamed up with friends Celli Firmi (Earthling/Soundaholix) and Mexican DJ and promoter Xavier Fux (Zulu Lounge) to collaborate on the psy-house project Vatos Locos. The first Vatos Locos album (Welcome to the Barrio) was released later that year by Sony Music. The second album, Attack and Release, went out in 2004 with Dragonfly Records. It was around this time that Nick began to grow disillusioned with the commercial and musical direction that the psy-trance scene was taking, and started to explore other avenues of musical expression. He is also one half of downtempo electronica project Third Ear Audio with Celli Firmi, and as a singer/songwriter is recording acoustic songs as Nicholas Barber. In 2008 he released an acoustic album called Clear Blue Sky under his own name. This was followed by a second album of songs called \"Seeds\". In April 2015 Let's Turn On was re-released by DAT Records in a remastered and expanded 2 CD version, featuring vintage alternate mixes of all the original tracks. One reviewer nominated it \"the greatest Goa Trance album of all time\". In early 2015 he started work as composer for the soundtrack of Bruce Parry's forthcoming documentary \"Quest\"."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Halina Czerny-Stefa\u0144ska (December 31, 1922 \u2013 July 1, 2001) was a Polish pianist. She studied piano under her father, Stanis\u0142aw Szwarcenberg-Czerny, as well as with Alfred Cortot at the \u00C9cole Normale de Musique in Paris, and later with J\u00F3zef Turczy\u0144ski and Zbigniew Drzewiecki in Warsaw. She was a joint First Prize winner at the International Chopin Piano Competition in Warsaw in 1949, sharing this prize with Bella Davidovich. Her repertoire was restricted to few composers other than Fr\u00E9d\u00E9ric Chopin and even her Chopin repertoire was not large. For example, she did not play the Piano Concerto No. 1 in E minor live until 1951, and she never played the F minor concerto at all, as she did not like it. She was proven to be the real pianist in a recording of the E minor concerto that was misattributed to Dinu Lipatti. The recording was released in 1966 by EMI, and on the 1971 British release was a note to the effect that, although the name of the conductor and orchestra were not known, there was no doubt the soloist was Lipatti. The BBC broadcast the recording in 1981, and a listener wrote in, noting the similarities between it and a Supraphon recording from the early 1950s with Czerny-Stefa\u0144ska under V\u00E1clav Smet\u00E1\u010Dek. Tests revealed these were one and the same recording. The so-called Lipatti recording was withdrawn. Halina Czerny-Stefa\u0144ska was a juror in many piano competitions including the Leeds International Pianoforte Competition, the International Tchaikovsky Competition, and the Marguerite Long-Jacques Thibaud Competition. She was also a juror at the International Chopin Piano Competition for many years. Her daughter, with husband Ludwik Stefa\u0144ski (1917\u20131982) is El\u017Cbieta Stefa\u0144ska-\u0141ukowicz (b. 1943), a harpsichordist and professor at the Academy of Music in Krak\u00F3w, Poland. Halina Czerny-Stefa\u0144ska died in Krak\u00F3w on July 1, 2001."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"John Philip \"Jake\" Thackray (27 February 1938 \u2013 24 December 2002) was an English singer-songwriter, poet and journalist. Best known in the late 1960s and early 1970s for his topical comedy songs performed on British television, his work ranged from satirical to bawdy to sentimental to pastoral, with a strong emphasis on storytelling, making him difficult to pigeonhole. Thackray sang in a lugubrious baritone voice, accompanying himself on a nylon-strung guitar in a style that was part classical, part jazz. His witty lyrics and clipped delivery, combined with his strong Yorkshire accent and the northern setting of many of his songs, led to him being described as the \"North Country No\u00EBl Coward\", a comparison Thackray resisted, although he acknowledged his lyrics were in the English tradition of Coward and Flanders and Swann, \"who are wordy, funny writers\". However, his tunes derived from the French chansonnier tradition: he claimed Georges Brassens as his greatest inspiration, and he was also influenced by Jacques Brel and Charles Trenet. He also admired Randy Newman. He was admired by, and influenced, many performers including Jarvis Cocker, Mike Harding, Momus, Ralph McTell, Morrissey, Alex Turner, and Jasper Carrott."@en .

	dbo:abstract	"(For other people named John Edmond, see John Edmond (disambiguation).) John Edmond (born 18 November 1936) is a folk singer who became popular in the 1970s for his Rhodesian patriotic songs. He reached the height of his fame during the Rhodesian Bush War. He was sometimes called the \"Bush Cat\". During his childhood, he and his parents moved between Scotland and Central Africa. He went to school in Luanshya, Northern Rhodesia, Edinburgh, Scotland, and in South Africa at Christian Brothers College in Pretoria. He displayed a natural talent for music at an early age when he was given a mouth organ as a birthday gift from his grandmother at age three. John mastered the instrument within half an hour. As a boy scout, he played the bugle and was in the local scout bugle band. While at school in Edinburgh, he was chosen to sing in the famous St John's boys choir. He was regularly featured in lead roles at Christian Brothers College in Gilbert and Sullivan operettas. John was lead drummer in the college's pipe band. He went on to win the South African Junior drumming championships at the Royal Scottish gathering at Wembley in 1953. After college, John was employed at the Roan Antelope copper mine. After some time there, Edmond joined Southern Rhodesia's Royal Rhodesia Regiment at Bulawayo. He served with the 3rd Battalion in the Congo, Nyasaland (now Malawi) and Southern Rhodesia. During this time, he bought a guitar at a trading store and met Bill Coleman while in the army. After learning to play the guitar with Coleman, Edmond formed the Bushcats Skiffle Group in 1958 along with two friends from the army, Eugene van der Watt and Ian Kerr. The group was a success among its peers and progressed into cabaret and rock 'n' roll. After his military service was up, John went to England to study computers and moved to South Africa during the mid-1960s. John became famous in Rhodesia during the Bush War with his album Troopiesongs. He was also a composer, writing such hits as \"The UDI Song\". After the war, and Zimbabwean Independence, he continued to record albums such as Zimsongs and Zimtrax. Since 1987, John and his wife Theresa have owned and maintained a resort in South Africa named \"Kunkuru\". The resort is located in the Bela Bela area. John also has his own record label, Roan Antelope Music (RAM)."@en .

A pupil of the eminent pedagogue Pyotr Stolyarsky, he won the national competition for young performers in Leningrad (St. Petersburg) at the age of 15. In 1937, at one of the most prestigious international competitions of its time, the [International Ysaye Competition, Stoliarsky students caused a sensation. Top prizes were garnered by David Oistrakh, Boris Goldshtein (Goldstein), Yelizaveta Gilels and Mikhail Fikhtengoltz. \"The results of the sessions created a profound impression: the Soviet school, with an assurance that bordered on arrogance, carried off all the prizes from the first down. The latter was awarded without the slightest discussion to the great David Oistrakh. Everyone else had to be content with crumbs; the Belgian violin school, though still a source of pride, failed, and its absence at the final was much commented on; Arthur Grumiaux and Carlo Van Neste, both young and inexperienced, were not able to convince the jury.\" He would go on to become a pedagogue as did David Oistrakh, Elizaveta Gilels, and others. During the height of Joseph Stalin's regime (Great Purge), Mikhail married the daughter of a high-ranking government official, who subsequently was executed as an \"enemy of the people\". His relatives immediately fell out of favor and Mikhail was told to divorce his politically stained wife. Fikhtengoltz refused to divorce her and immediately had all prestigious concerts cancelled. The nervous strain was heavy on him, and one of his hands failed - after a few minutes of playing, pain forced him to stop. Fikhtengoltz started making arrangements of popular piano and orchestral pieces, working in the studio, where he could always take a break and endure the pain. He was also increasingly getting into teaching, and soon after he was teaching at the Gnessin State Musical College in Moscow. During the mid-Sixties a leading psychotherapist ventured to get Mikhail playing again. Much to his colleagues\u2019 surprise, the man quickly restored mobility to Mikhail\u2019s failing hand. Mikhail rehearsed day and night, and after 23 years away from the stage, he began playing again.The strain to retrieve the time he had lost was great, and he died of a heart attack at the age of 65. Picking up where her father left off, Natalya Fikhtengoltz, a violinist and a talented teacher as well, is bringing up her students in the grand traditions bequeathed by the late Pyotr Stolyarsky. She has also released a series of CDs with recordings once made by her late father."@en .

Listening to Hank Williams as a child around the age of 9 or 10 sparked his interest in performing country music. Before beginning his country music career, he tried to break into R&B. Although he was unable to secure a recording contract as a soul singer himself, he did pen several songs recorded by James Carr, including the title songs to Carr's albums You Got My Mind Messed Up and A Man Needs a Woman. Known to refer to himself as the \"Chocolate Cowboy\", McClinton successfully marketed his album called The Only One on television long before the practice was commonplace. Featuring his first country chart single \"Don't Let The Green Grass Fool You\", a top 40 song in 1972, he considered it to be his finest work.

	dbo:abstract	"Kitty Kallen (born Katie Kallen; May 25, 1921 \u2013 January 7, 2016) was an American popular singer whose career spanned from the 1930s to the 1960s,to include the Swing era of the Big Band years, the post-WWII pop scene and the early years of rock 'n roll. Kallen performed with popular big band leaders of the 1940s, including Jimmy Dorsey and Harry James, before establishing a solo career. She is widely known for her 1954 solo recording '\"Little Things Mean a Lot\", a song that stayed at the U.S. number one spot for nine consecutive weeks, charted in the U.S. for almost seven months, hit #1 on the UK singles chart, and sold more than two million copies. AllMusic called the recording a \"monster hit\", and music historian Jonny Whiteside said the song \"ably characterizes Kallen\u2019s impressive, and graceful, transition from classic big band swing to modern post-war pop.\" Voted \"most popular female singer\" in 1954 in both Billboard and Variety polls, Kallen lost her voice at the Palladium in 1955 at the top of her career and left singing for four years, suffering paralyzed vocal cords. After testing her voice under a pseudonym in small town venues, she ultimately returned and went on to achieve 13 top-ten career hits. Kallen performed at numerous prominent live venues including Manhattan's Copacabana, Morris Levy's Versailles, the Capitol Theater, the Maisonette Room at the St. Regis, the Cafe Rouge at the Hotel Pennsylvania and the Plaza Hotel's Persian Room. As well, she starred on Broadway in Finian's Rainbow; in the 1955 film The Second Greatest Sex and on numerous television shows including The Tonight Show with Johnny Carson, The Big Beat with singer-host Richard Hayes, American Bandstand, and Fred Allen's Judge for Yourself. In 1951, Kallen appeared with Buster Crabbe as the Queen and King of Winter at the Lake Placid resort. During the height of her popularity, three imposters billed themselves as Kitty Kallen. When one of them, Genevieve Agostinello, died in 1978, it was incorrectly reported that Kallen herself had died. On February 8, 1960, Kallen received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame (located on the north side of Hollywood Boulevard at #7021)."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Eric Herman (real name Eric Herman Endres) is a children's music performer based in the Pacific Northwest. His music combines various styles of rock music with often wryly humorous kid-related lyrics to create what he refers to as \"cool tunes for kids.\" Popular songs of his include the viral YouTube hit, \"The Elephant Song\", \"There's a Monster in My House\", \"Blackbeard, Bluebeard and Redbeard\" and \"Cowboy Bergaleoukaleopaleous\". Herman performed with Western New York area rock bands including Ember and The Infydels, and he was a regular performer on the Buffalo area acoustic singer/songwriter and live theater scenes. In 2003 a successful production of a musical comedy he wrote, A Week in the Life, was staged at the Alleyway Theater in Buffalo, New York, earning him an Artie Award nomination as \"Best Actor in a Musical\". But with the success of his first album of music for kids, The Kid in the Mirror, Herman decided to devote his full attention to producing and performing kids' music under the act name Eric Herman and the Invisible Band. His second album, Monkey Business, proved even more successful, with Seattle's Victory Music Review calling it \"one of the best kids' records ever\". He has since released several other CDs to further acclaim. Eric Herman songs and videos have been heard and seen nationally on PBS Kids, The Today Show, Sirius XM and Fox & Friends. His song \"Blackbeard, Bluebeard and Redbeard\" was voted \"Best Children's Song\" by the international Just Plain Folks Music Organization for their 2006 awards, and he received a Parents' Choice Award for his What a Ride! and Incredibly Spaced-Out Adventures of Jupiter Jackson albums. Eric's music videos have become extremely popular, with over 50 million views on YouTube, led by \"The Elephant Song\", which was featured by YouTube in May 2007. In 2010 \"The Elephant Song\" was covered by the duo, Victor and Leo, for the CD/DVD release \"XSPB 10\" by Brazilian superstar, Xuxa, and his video for \"The Tale of the Sun and the Moon\" was featured prominently in a scene of the Warner Bros. movie Life as We Know It (film). Eric's songs have been regular top sellers on the popular indie music site, CDBaby, at one time holding 8 of the top 10 spots. Several of Herman's songs have words written by or with noted children's poetry author, Kenn Nesbitt (who has also provided voice characters for some recordings, including the voice of Bluebeard on \"Blackbeard, Bluebeard and Redbeard\"), and Herman credits his wife, Roseann, with co-writing many of his songs and co-producing his albums. Roseann, also cited as Eric's PR manager, died in 2013 after a long illness. Herman has also collaborated with children's musician Eric Ode for the song \"My Lucky Day\" and singer/songwriter Steve Brown for the song \"How to Move a Monster.\" Guest artists appearing on Eric Herman recordings include Sam Payne (\"Scat Cat\"), Keith Grimwood and Ezra Idlet of Trout Fishing in America (band) (\"The Incredibly Spaced-Out Adventures of Jupiter Jackson\"), Roger Day (\"Electrical Storm\"), Gwendolyn (artist) Sanford of Gwendolyn and the Good Time Gang (\"Come Play\"), Jim Dague of Scribblemonster (\"How to Move a Monster\"), The Hughes Brothers (\"Cowboy Bergaleoukaleopaleous\"), Robbi K (\"How Big\"), Jen Marco Handy (\"This Little Light of Mine\"), Ryan Tilby (\"Carseat Snack\"), Josh Dutton of The Duttons (\"What a Ride\"), Tito Uquillas of The Hipwaders (\"Time Machine\") and Mr. Billy (\"How to Move a Monster\"). Between 2006 and 2010, Eric Herman hosted the \"Cool Tunes for Kids\" blogsite, with interviews and features about other noted kids' music artists, such as Trout Fishing in America (band), Ralph's World, Imagination Movers and They Might Be Giants, as well as articles by Herman about his experiences working in the kids' music field. In 2011, Eric expanded his performance options to include a live band, known as Eric Herman and the Thunder Puppies. Band members as of 2015 are Chris Baugh (bass/vocals), Ben Macy (keyboard/accordion), Dave Pettey (guitar/vocals), and Javier Ruiz (drums/vocals). The band collaborated on the song \"A Million Ways to Play\" from Party Animal, and is scheduled to release a full album, Bubble Wrap, in 2016. Herman often includes his daughters, Becca and Evee, as part of his live shows. Herman has identified himself as a Latter-day Saint, but his music for kids is non-religious in nature."@en ;

He started out his career in a Pakistani musical group called Awaz. However to conflicts of interest the band split and they all went to become solo artists.

His song in the album called Dil Na Lagey was the number one song for many weeks and was the best national song of the year 2000. His latest album is Mantra. On that album there is a song called Jiya Na Jaye, in which Faakhir shares a duet with Indian singer Sunidhi Chauhan. Another song in that album called Mahi Ve won two awards in the India Sangeet Awards, in which he also performed. One reason why Faakhir's music is popular is because of its unique use of diverse music and lyrics. He has a lot of Western and European influences in his music. His song Dil Ruba which is a track with Spanish influence and his song Kabhi Kabhi Pyar Mein were also instant hits. His single Sub To Suniyeh was also a big hit."@en ;

She was born and raised in Decatur, Georgia, and spent most of her youth working with producer Anthony Dent, as a songwriter and background vocalist for several R&B and hip hop artists. By the age of 14, Hilson had secured a record deal with the girl group D'Signe, who later disbanded. She attended Oxford College of Emory University and Emory University in Atlanta, while she continued writing songs for artists, including Britney Spears, The Pussycat Dolls, and Mary J. Blige, with the production and songwriting team, The Clutch. In 2006, Hilson signed with American rapper and producer Timbaland's record label, Mosley Music. Her breakthrough came the following year after appearing on Timbaland's single \"The Way I Are\", which topped charts around the world. Hilson's music style is generally R&B, hip hop and pop; womanhood, sexual intimacy and love are typical themes. Her musical influences come from her father's side of the family. Hilson's debut studio album, In a Perfect World..., was released in 2009, and debuted at number four on the US Billboard 200 chart, eventually being certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). The album spawned the hit singles, \"Knock You Down\", \"Turnin Me On\" and \"I Like\". It also earned Hilson two Grammy Award nominations for Best New Artist and Best Rap/Sung Collaboration for \"Knock You Down\". Her second studio album, No Boys Allowed, was released in 2010 and was considerably less successful than its predecessor; however, it included the platinum single, \"Pretty Girl Rock\". Besides her music career, Hilson has also contributed to various charities and pursued a career in acting, but she continues to record and perform music. She has contributed in the fight against HIV and AIDS, helped various relief efforts for natural disasters, and become involved with several educational organizations. In 2012, Hilson made her acting debut in the romantic comedy film, Think Like a Man. Her achievements include a BET Award, MOBO Award, NAACP Image Award and two Soul Train Music Awards."@en ;

She is the daughter of actor Keith Allen and film producer Alison Owen. Allen left school when she was 15 and concentrated on improving her performing and compositional skills. In 2005, she made some of her recordings public on Myspace and the publicity resulted in airplay on BBC Radio 1 and a contract with Regal Recordings. Her first mainstream single, \"Smile\", reached number one on the UK Singles Chart in July 2006. Her debut record, Alright, Still, was well received, selling over 2.6 million copies worldwide and brought Allen a nomination at the Grammy Awards, Brit Awards and MTV Video Music Awards. She began hosting her own talk-show, Lily Allen and Friends, on BBC Three. Her second studio album, It's Not Me, It's You, saw a genre shift, having more of an electropop feel, rather than the ska and reggae influences of the first one. The album debuted at number one on the UK Albums Chart and the Australian ARIA Charts and was well received by critics, noting the singer's musical evolution and maturity. It spawned the hit singles \"The Fear\" and \"Fuck You\". This success saw her receive the Brit Award for British Female Solo Artist at the 2010 Brit Awards. Allen and Amy Winehouse were credited with starting a process that led to the \"year of the women\" media label in 2009 that saw five female artists making music of \"experimentalism and fearlessness\" nominated for the Mercury Prize. In 2009, Allen announced that she would be taking a hiatus from musical activities. In 2011, she launched her own record label. In 2013, Allen revealed that she had begun working on her third studio album, which was later titled Sheezus. On 12 November 2013, Allen premiered the video for her first original song since 2009, \"Hard out Here\", which was released as a single five days later."@en ;

Alceu Valenca was born in countryside Pernambuco, Northeast Brazil. He is considered the most successful artist in achieving an aesthetic balance between traditional northeastern Brazilian music and a broad range of electronic sounds and effects from pop music. One can find traces of maracatu, coco and \"repentes de viola\" (improvising fast-paced Brazilian folk music) in most of his songs. Alceu was able to utilize the electric guitar the electric bass, and lately even a synthesizer was added to his broad scope of musical instruments. Because of that, Alceu was able to recreate Northeastern traditional music, like bai\u00E3o, coco, toada, maracatu, frevo, caboclinhos, embolada and repentes: all sung with a sometimes rock sometimes alternative sounding music background. His music and his themes are intangible, universal and unlimited. However, his aesthetic basis is genuinely Brazilian Northeastern music."@en .

	dbo:abstract	"Andy Offutt Irwin (born 1957) is an American storyteller, arts educator, singer-songwriter and humorist. Born and raised in Covington, Georgia, a small town outside of Atlanta, Irwin began his career in 1984 with an improvisational comedy troupe at Walt Disney World. After five years he shifted to performing as a singer-songwriter, touring the Southeast. In the mid-1990s, Irwin branched into performances for children and since then has appeared in hundreds of schools (from preschools to colleges) and countless public libraries. Irwin continued to perform as a singer-songwriter and added storytelling to these performances, usually telling one story (about ten to twenty-five minutes in length) during a show. In the fall of 2004 he decided to pursue storytelling as a career and quickly achieved national prominence. Irwin now appears regularly in storytelling festivals across the United States. He has released several albums which feature stories, songs or whistling and has collected numerous awards for these albums. In 2013, Irwin received the Circle of Excellence Award from the National Storytelling Network. In addition to performing, Irwin worked as an artist-in-residence at Oxford College of Emory University and Georgia College for a total of fifteen years. During that time he directed several plays, conducted acting workshops and served as an acting coach. Irwin was also featured as storyteller and host of the program Evening Star on public radio. Currently, Irwin divides his time between storytelling festivals and children\u2019s performances. Irwin also performs as a whistler with the Kandinsky Trio, a chamber music group."@en ;

Active since 1983, Joseph has performed in front of more than a half million people around the world. He played various instruments in rock bands throughout the Midwest until 1989 when Greek composer Yanni hired him for his core band after hearing a tape of his original compositions. He was a featured concert keyboardist with Yanni through six major tours, most recently in 2003 for the 60-city Ethnicity tour. He appears in the multi-platinum album and concert film, Live at the Acropolis. Joseph also spent four years as musical director and lead keyboardist for Sheena Easton, including a 1995 performance on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno. Joseph is the founder of the Robbins Island Music label. His solo career began when he independently released Hear the Masses, featuring many of his Yanni bandmates. This debut was followed by Rapture, an instrumental album recorded with a 50-piece orchestra in which Joseph wrote and conducted all of the scores. It was released on the Narada label and reached ZMR Airwaves Top 30. A number of subsequent recordings including Christmas Around the World and One Deep Breath also held positions on ZMR's Top 100 radio chart, with the most recent being Paint the Sky which debuted at #15 in April 2013.

In 2006, NPR's All Songs Considered named David one of the \"best living songwriters\" alongside Bob Dylan, Paul McCartney and Tom Waits. Dondero started his musical career on drums at the age of 10, due in part to the fact that he \"was always drumming on stuff with my hands\". Dondero released four records with the Clemson, SC-based punk/hardcore band Sunbrain (three on Grass Records and one on Ghostmeat Records), before breaking up in 1995. The following year, Dondero joined This Bike Is A Pipe Bomb for nearly two years as their drummer. He left in 1998 to focus on his solo material.

Jolicoeur, Vincent Mason and Kelvin Mercer were friends who attended the same high school in the Amityville area of Long Island during the 1980s. After they decided to form a rap group, each member re-christened themselves with an outlandish name (Trugoy the Dove, P.A. Pasemaster Mase and Posdnuos, respectively). Early on, Jolicoeur sported a unique style of African medallions, peace signs and uneven dreadlocks (known as the \"De La Do\"). Paired with the positive messages of the group's debut effort, 3 Feet High and Rising, the image led to critics and journalists labelling the members as \"the hippies of hip hop\" (a title that the group was quick to refute with the release of the second album De La Soul Is Dead in 1991). Jolicoeur is also a member of the Spitkicker collective."@en ;

Because of her prolific repertoire, which includes hundreds of songs, and because of her contribution to Roma culture and its promotion, she is nicknamed Queen of the Gypsies. She started to sing while she was a teenager in the 1950s, and her career spans over five decades. Her musical success is closely linked to her marriage with Stevo Teodosievski, who was a composer, arranger and director of a musical ensemble, the Ansambl Teodosievski. He wrote many of her songs and fully managed her career until his death in 1997. Her musical style is mostly inspired by traditional Roma and Macedonian music. Some other influences are also noticeable, such as pop music. Esma Red\u017Eepova started her career at a period when Romani music was very denigrated in Yugoslavia and Roma people considered it shameful for women to sing in public. Red\u017Eepova was one of the first singers to sing in Romani language on radio and television. Red\u017Eepova is particularly noted for her powerful and emotional voice. In 2010, she was cited among the 50 great voices in the world by NPR, a prominent American media organization. Red\u017Eepova is also noted for her extravagant attires and her turbans, as well as the use she makes of typical stereotypes about Roma women, such as sensuality and happiness. In 2010, she was awarded the Macedonian Order of Merit, and she was entitled National Artist of the Republic of Macedonia in 2013 by the Macedonian President, Gjorgje Ivanov. With her late husband Stevo Teodosievski she has fostered forty-seven children, and has received numerous accolades for her humanitarian work. She supports Roma and women rights and is also involved in local politics in her hometown, Skopje. Red\u017Eepova, together with Vlatko Lozanoski, represented Macedonia in the Eurovision Song Contest 2013 in Malm\u00F6, Sweden."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Frankie Negr\u00F3n (born January 21, 1977, in Newark, New Jersey to Francisco Negr\u00F3n Santos and Zaida Gonzalez) is a singer of salsa music of Puerto Rican descent. He is among a group of notable young tropical singers and soneros who have woven a blend of pop, rock, gospel music, R&B, hip-hop, and reggaet\u00F3n elements into their salsa, a group that includes Huey Dunbar, Charlie Cruz, Kevin Ceballo, and Obie Berm\u00FAdez. Siblings include a younger sister, Jaqueline Negr\u00F3n (Jackie Negr\u00F3n), who is also a singer and dancer, and a brother, David Negr\u00F3n. Frankie attended Newark Arts High School in the early 90s gaining notoriety as part of an R&B singing group called Base Harmony (the other members at this time were Sean Pulley, Dionte Sutton, Kwhan Jarmond, and Bobby Bright). As part of Base Harmony, Frankie sang for audiences in the New Jersey Senate, Newark City Hall, The United in Group Harmony Association, and various clubs and venues around the tri-state area. It was during this period with Base Harmony that Frankie reinforced his already great vocal talents with an understanding of soul singing, complex group harmony, and stage performance that he'd draw from later in his musical career. Fluent in both English and Spanish, Frankie was raised in New Jersey primarily as an English speaker, but developed his initial love of salsa from his father's record collection. He sings almost exclusively in Spanish, but converses and jokes with his audiences in both languages. The first of his seven studio albums to date, Con Amor Se Gana (roughly translatable as \"Love Conquers All\"), was released in May 1997. His last salsa release, Mejor Que Nunca (\"Better than Ever\"), was released in August 2006. Frankie Negr\u00F3n also has tried his hand at acting. Paul Simon, conducting an audition of Base Harmony for the Broadway musical The Capeman, immediately recognized Frankie as someone worth watching and gave him a supporting role in the play as part of the \"Doo Wop Group Ensemble\" (cast under the name Frank Negron ). Frankie and members of Base Harmony also participated in the recording of the play's soundtrack CD \"Songs From The Capeman\". Also, in 2000 Frankie starred as a struggling artist in the South Bronx in Val Lik's independent film, Boricua's Bond . His singing career has been far more successful, evidenced by two Gold Album awards, for Con Amor Se Gana and No Me Compares (\"Don't Compare Me\"), and nine Billboard Top 40 Hot Latin Tracks to date. Frankie has also earned Grammy Award nominations, Billboard Award nods and two Premio Lo Nuestro Awards for Song of the Year. In an All Music Guide review, Frankie is referred to as \"the genre's next definitive voice.\" Negr\u00F3n appeared on the American soap opera One Life to Live on August 5, 2009 to perform music from his then upcoming album Independence Day. on Airgo Music. The Jimmy Greco produced Independence Day was released in September, 2009 as the singer's first crossover into the English market. Negr\u00F3n's CD got enthusiastic reviews, with Jon Pareles of the New York Times highlighting the CD in his Fall record release roundup. Airgo are currently in the process of re-releasing Independence Day with Negr\u00F3n's performance of the Kara DioGuardi/David Cook penned song \"No Reply,\" mixed by Tom Lord-Alge."@en .

Goodiepal's work often involves lectures and performances on the future of computer music, his own compositional practices and resonance computing. His tours have included 150 universities internationally. From 2004 till 2008 he was the head of the electronic music department and a teacher at DIEM (Danish Institute for Electro-acoustic Music) at the Royal Academy of Music in Aarhus, Denmark. He is the author of two books, Radical Computer Music & Fantastisk Mediemanipulation and El Camino Del Hardcore - Rejsen Til Nordens Indre. Goodiepal is also known for travelling over very long distances using only his home-made cabin bike Kommunal Klon Komputer 2 that, with the help of a top-of-the-line dynamo system, could provide all the electric power needed for the equipment he used during a concert (which often involves playing back and recording from his audio recorder). Goodiepal has given away both money and most of his belongings; in 2011 he published an \u201Calbum object\u201D containing a 500 Danish Crowns note and sold it for 250 Danish Crowns. During the Transmediale 2012 festival Goodiepal shipped his belongings over to install and subsequently give them away one by one, dubbed as the 'MORT AUX VACHES EKSTRA EXTRA \u2013 THE GIVE AWAY!' performance. In 2014 an advertisement in the Wire hinted at Goodiepal looking for a new owner for his self made Mechanical Birds. In 2014, Goodiepal sold Kommunal Klon Komputer 2 to the National Gallery of Denmark, where it is now on display. A new bike is in the making, Kommunal Klon Komputer 9.

	dbo:abstract	"Hubert-F\u00E9lix Thi\u00E9faine (French pronunciation: \u200B[yb\u025B\u0281 feliks tjef\u025Bn]) is a French pop-rock singer and songwriter. He was born on 21 July 1948 in the town of Dole in the Jura d\u00E9partement. Mostly shunned by television and radio, he has built over the years \u2013 through word of mouth and frequent touring \u2013 a considerable following which allowed him to fill the 17,000-seater Palais omnisports de Paris-Bercy for an anniversary concert in 1998. In recent years he has been increasingly name-dropped as an influence by the latest generation of performers in France, and was the subject of a tribute album of covers in 2002. He has been performing since the late 1960s and releasing records since 1978. Musically, Thi\u00E9faine draws mostly from classic rock, with rare nods to the latest musical trends, and generally leaves the arranging to a collaborator. His songs are most notable for instantly recognisable lyrics, with their trademarks streams of consciousness, surreal and often extreme or dark imagery, often tinged with comedy, cynicism, literary references, neologisms and liberal use of scientific, long or foreign words. The lyrical mayhem sometimes spreads into comically long song titles, such as Enferm\u00E9 dans les cabinets (avec la fille mineure des 80 chasseurs), or Exercice de simple provocation avec 33 fois le mot \u00AB coupable \u00BB. His education in a Catholic boarding school has also left deep traces which surface in his lyrics in the form of biblical quotations and cheerfully blasphemous lyrics. His avowed influences include L\u00E9o Ferr\u00E9, Lou Reed, and many French, Anglo-Saxon and German novelists and poets, with a preference for romantic literature."@en .

	dbo:abstract	"Ian Gillan (born 19 August 1945) is an English singer and songwriter. He originally found commercial success as the lead singer and lyricist for Deep Purple. Initially influenced by Elvis Presley, Gillan started and fronted several local bands in the mid-sixties, and eventually joined Episode Six when their original singer left. He first found widespread commercial success after joining Deep Purple in 1969. After an almost non-stop workload, during which time he recorded six albums in four years, and problematic relationships with other band members, particularly guitarist Ritchie Blackmore, Gillan resigned from the band in June 1973, having given a lengthy notice period to their managers. After a short time away from the music business, he resumed his music career with solo bands the Ian Gillan Band and Gillan, before a year-long stint as the vocalist for Black Sabbath. He rejoined a reformed Deep Purple in 1984, but was fired in 1989. He rejoined the band for a second time in 1992 for their twenty-fifth anniversary, and following the recruitment of guitarist Steve Morse in 1994, has helped transform the group into a regular touring outfit, which he has fronted ever since. In addition to his main work\u2014performing with Deep Purple and other bands during the 1970s and 1980s\u2014he sang the role of Jesus in the original recording of Andrew Lloyd Webber's rock opera Jesus Christ Superstar, performed in the charity supergroup Rock Aid Armenia, and engaged in a number of business investments and ventures, including a hotel, a motorcycle manufacturer, and music recording facilities at Kingsway Studios. More recently, he has performed solo concerts concurrently with his latter career in Deep Purple, and his work and affinity with Armenia, combined with his continued friendship with Tony Iommi since his brief time in Black Sabbath, has led him to form the supergroup WhoCares with Iommi. His solo career outside of Deep Purple was given a comprehensive overview with the Gillan's Inn box set in 2006."@en ;

In life and death, several media outlets including CNN, Billboard, Fox News, and The New York Times have labeled her as the most important female figure and top selling female artist in the Mexican music genre. Billboard magazine named her the \"top Latin artist of 2013\", the \"best selling Latin artist of 2013\". Rivera began recording music in 1992. Her recordings often had themes of social issues, infidelity, and relationships. Rivera released her first studio album, Si Quieres Verme Llorar, in the late 1990s, failing to attain commercial success; however, she rose to prominence in the United States and Mexico with her major-label debut, Parrandera, Rebelde y Atrevida. In the early 2000s, she was often criticized and was refused bookings at venues across California for performing Banda music\u2014a male-dominated music genre. However, her popularity grew after she won the Lo Nuestro Award for Regional Mexican Female Artist of the Year in 2007, which she won nine consecutive times. Her tenth studio album, Jenni (2008) became her first No.1 record on the Billboard Top Latin Albums chart in the United States. In 2010, she appeared in and produced the reality TV show Jenni Rivera Presents: Chiquis & Raq-C. She also appeared in and produced I Love Jenni starting in 2011 through 2013 and Chiquis 'n Control in 2012. Her acting debut was in the film Filly Brown, which was released in 2013. Rivera garnered nominations and awards from Latin music's most prestigious accolades. Over the course of her career she was awarded two Oye! Awards (Mexico's equivalent to the United States' Grammy Awards), two Billboard Music Awards, twenty-two Billboard Latin Music Awards, eleven Billboard Mexican Music Awards and eighteen Lo Nuestro Awards. She received four Latin Grammy nominations.

Aside from music, she was active in her community and donated her time to civic causes. The National Coalition Against Domestic Violence appointed her its spokesperson in the United States. A proclamation was given \"officially naming\" August 6 \u201CJenni Rivera Day\u201D by the Los Angeles City Council for all her charity work and community involvement. Rivera, along with six others, died in a plane crash near Iturbide, Nuevo Le\u00F3n on December 9, 2012. Her death made international headlines for weeks. In December 2014, Mexican authorities closed the investigation on what brought the plane down. Mexican Director of Civil Aviation, Gilberto G\u00F3mez Meyer, stated that the results of the plane crash have come back inconclusive and that they are unable to determine the exact cause of the crash. Lawsuits involving the owners of the plane, Rivera's estate, and family members of those on board with Rivera have been filed in The Superior Court of Los Angeles County."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Kelvin Mercer (born August 17, 1969) is a rapper, producer, and one-third of the hip hop trio De La Soul. He is known more famously by his alias Posdnuos, or simply Pos. He was born in the Bronx, New York and grew up in East Massapequa, New York. Mercer and David Jude Jolicoeur were childhood friends. They met Vincent Mason in the early 1980s while attending Amityville High School in Long Island, New York. Mercer's father was a jazz fan. As a member of De La Soul, Mercer is generally regarded as one of the most consistent and underrated MCs of all time. He has imparted some of his hard-earned experiences in songs such as \"Held Down\", and \"Trying People\", from AOI: Bionix. On the latter, he raps: \"We were supposed to rid the world of danger / These days we nod heads and small talk like polite strangers / It's natural to fall off, just land close to the tree / I'll be there if they need me to be\". Mercer is also known for his witty, double entendre-laden battle rhymes. \"Fuck bein' hard, Posdnuos is complicated\" from Buhloone Mindstate's \"In the Woods\". For example, in \"Down Syndrome\" from 1996's Stakes Is High, he states: \"I be a piece of the East Coast, so give a toast to Plug Wonder Why / Back in the day who soaked his words in ginger / So when I ran a phrase in June, you didn't catch it 'til December\". He is a member of the Spitkicker collective."@en ;

He joined the band after the release of their first album, which allowed Jens Kidman to focus on his vocal performances. He is known for his strong and complex rhythm guitar playing. Hagstr\u00F6m has cited Rush, James Hetfield, Squarepusher, Autechre, Strapping Young Lad, and GISM as influences. In a Metal Injection interview he has said, \"You can't play an instrument for the technicality of it. It's a tool you use it to get what's in here and here [heart and mind] out there.\" He has also said when he was growing up, everybody in Sweden was trying to be a guitar virtuoso. This made him want to be solely a rhythm guitarist. Although fellow Meshuggah guitarist Fredrik Thordendal plays most of Meshuggah's guitar solos, the two of them share songwriting duties more or less equally, with Hagstr\u00F6m notably contributing \"Nebulous\" from Nothing, \"Acrid Placidity\" from Destroy Erase Improve, and \"Neurotica\" from Chaosphere. Hagstr\u00F6m has also stepped out of his role of playing rhythm guitar with the release of Meshuggah's obZen album by playing the slower, melodic leads on the songs that he wrote, such as \"Electric Red\" and \"Pravus\". In addition to this, he has contributed lyrics to some of the band's later releases, co-writing Catch 33 with Meshuggah drummer Tomas Haake and penning the entirety of the words for their abstract EP I. Hagstr\u00F6m and Haake have been playing music together since they were nine years old. Hagstr\u00F6m, along with Fredrik Thordendal, was rated #35 by Guitar World as the top 100 greatest heavy metal guitarist of all-time."@en ;

His first band was War Cry, founded in 1982. In 1983 he started the band Master as a death metal band. Due to internal problems it was put on hold and Speckmann started another band, called Death Strike for which he recorded one demo. which was later released on Nuclear Blast with additional tracks as an album.. After obtaining a deal for Abomination on Nuclear Blast, Master was approached at the same time and Master re-surfaced to record a full-length CD as well. The band subsequently broke up in the original form two days after the recording. They were replaced shortly afterward by Aaron Nickeas on drums, and Jim Martinelli on guitars. This period was followed by the Fleische tour with Master as headliner, Abomination as support, and Pungent Stench in the middle of both acts. Nickeas and Speckmann played in both groups for 26 dates on this tour. Speckmann recorded the self-titled debut album, which was really the Master songs re-recorded with Martinelli and Nickeas. Nuclear Blast turned this down, and decided to remix the original recording with Schmidt and Mittelbrun. The recording with Martinelli and Nickeas was then released as the Speckmann Project. Speckmann also played, and wrote all the songs for a band called, Abomination and recorded two albums with them. Currently he is playing bass guitar in the Czech death metal band Krabathor, as well as keeping Master alive. He also played in the Master-Krabathor side-project Martyr and released one album with them. The band Krabathor split up in 2004 and Master was reformed with guitarist Alex Nejezchleba and drummer Zdenek Pradlovsky.

Wright is affectionately called \"The Godfather of Gangsta Rap\". He was born to Richard and Kathie Wright in Compton, California. After dropping out of high school in the tenth grade, he supported himself primarily by selling drugs before founding Ruthless Records and becoming a rapper. Arabian Prince, Eazy-E, Dr. Dre and Ice Cube formed N.W.A. After DJ Yella and MC Ren joined the group, N.W.A released their debut single Panic Zone. In 1988, they released their most controversial album, Straight Outta Compton. The group released two more albums and then disbanded after Eazy released Dr. Dre from his contract. Eazy's main influences included 1970s funk groups, contemporary rappers, and comedians. When reviewing Eazy's albums, many critics noted his unique overall style, with Steve Huey of the All Music Guide remarking: \"While his technical skills as a rapper were never the greatest, his distinctive delivery... over-the-top lyrics, and undeniable charisma made him a star.\""@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Hiram King \"Hank\" Williams, (/h\u00E6\u014Bk w\u026Alj\u0259mz /; September 17, 1923 \u2013 January 1, 1953) was an American singer-songwriter and musician. Regarded as one of the most significant and influential American singers and songwriters of the 20th century, Williams recorded 35 singles (five released posthumously) that reached the Top 10 of the Billboard Country & Western Best Sellers chart, including 11 that ranked number one (three posthumously). Born in Mount Olive, Butler County, Alabama, Williams moved to Georgiana, where he met Spencer Rose, a white country performer who gave him guitar lessons in exchange for meals or money. Payne had a major influence on Williams' later musical style, along with Roy Acuff and Ernest Tubb. During this time, Williams informally changed his name to Hank, believing it to be a better name for country music. He moved to Montgomery, where he began his music career in 1937, when producers at radio station WSFA hired him to perform and host a 15-minute program. He formed as backup the Drifting Cowboys band, which was managed by his mother, and dropped out of school to devote his time to his career. When several of his band members were conscripted into military service during World War II, Williams had trouble with their replacements, and WSFA terminated his contract because of his alcohol abuse. Williams eventually married Audrey Sheppard, who was his manager for nearly a decade. After recording \"Never Again\" and \"Honky Tonkin'\" with Sterling Records, he signed a contract with MGM Records. In 1948 he released \"Move It on Over\", which became a hit, and also joined the Louisiana Hayride radio program. One year later, he released a cover of \"Lovesick Blues\", which carried him into the mainstream of music. After an initial rejection, Williams joined the Grand Ole Opry. He was unable to read or notate music to any significant degree. Among the hits he wrote were \"Your Cheatin' Heart\", \"Hey, Good Lookin'\", and \"I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry\". Several years of back pain, alcoholism, and prescription drug abuse severely damaged Williams' health. He divorced Sheppard and was dismissed by the Grand Ole Opry because of his unreliability and alcohol abuse. Williams died in 1953 at the age of 29, from heart failure exacerbated by pills and alcohol. Despite his short life, Williams has had a major influence on 20th-century popular music, especially country music. The songs he wrote and recorded have been covered by numerous artists and have been hits in various genres. He has been inducted into multiple music halls of fame, such as the Country Music Hall of Fame (1961), the Songwriters Hall of Fame (1970), and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame (1987)."@en ;
