Box (1980\u20131986; 2001\u20132005). In 1977, he was discovered by the P. Mobil members on a Napsug\u00E1r-concert and was brought to play in the band. In 1978 they recorded a live album which should have been the first P. Mobil release, but it was released only in the spring of 1999. In 1980 he departed with S\u00E1ndor Bencsik and formed P. Box (after a Procol Harum song). He settled in Debrecen (220 km from the capital) in 1986, and the distance caused him to disband P. Box. The other members of the band continued for a short while as Metal Company, then they united with Gyula De\u00E1k \"Bill\", so their name became \"Bill \u00E9s Box\". S\u00E1ndor Bencsik left Hungary in 1987, but died suddenly in Austria. Cserh\u00E1ti started a studio in his home, where he discovered the band \"Szfinx\", becoming its manager. In 1999 the first two full-length albums were re-released on CD, remastered. In 2001 he revived P. Box, with two Szfinx and two Aberra members. They released a returning single, and a year after a new album came out. In 2003 they released the first ever official concert album of P. Box. In 2005, they started to record the new album Pangea. At this time, doctors found out Cserh\u00E1ti was ill with cancer. Despite this, they continued the recordings, and Pangea came out in July. He died in mid-August."@en ;

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/MG!_The_Visionary>	rdf:type	umbel-rc:MusicalPerformer ;
	dbo:abstract	"Martin George Brazier, Jr. (born September 26, 1973), who goes by the stage name MG! The Visionary (shortly known simply as Visionary), is an underground hip hop artist who was a member of New Life Crew, known from 1993-1996 as Third Nail Productions (or 3NP!), considered by many to be a founding member of the Christian hip hop community. He was the mind behind the original concept and inception of Uprok Records, a hip-hop division of Seattle based Tooth and Nail Records. Unfortunately as many of the great musicians of their time have found, the \"business\" of music has its own way of getting in the way of the music itself. As Uprok continued to go a completely different direction from the original intention MG! began to distance himself and eventually parted ways with the label, relieved to see the eventually folding of Uprok, his idea, as it had lost sight of the original purpose and strayed so far. MG! writes all original music and lyrics and produces most of his own content and is now independently releasing albums. With his first solo album on Uprok, he worked with the every legendary Pigeon John, World famous Beat Junkey DJ Melo D, and also singer-songwriter/guitarist Pauly Paul. He also produced and recorded the project Sinner's Prayer released in 2000, which is the first full length praise hip hop album ever released, and contains other artists such as Mars Ill and Playdough, Othello, and MO, just to name a few. It's been said that MG stands \"Man of God\", which is true to be certain. But it is actually the first 2 initials of the artist's given name. As the story goes, MG! had no desire to come up with some witty or poignant reference to whatever movie or scripture or book or ANYTHING so many rappers had subsequently drawn from in the early 90's. Instead, he felt his first 2 initials were good enough - M being for Martin and G for George; the very same letters donned on the back of his letterman's jacket reading \"The MG!\". MG! had always desired to allow the people to label him as opposed to labeling himself and has stood by this same principle throughout his career. Strangely enough, at the first show his original rap duo 3NP! (Third Nail Productions) headlined, MG! was approached after the show by - of all people - a young concert goer no more than 11yrs of age. The child asked him quite excitedly, \"Does MG! stand for man of God?\". Little did the child know, his question would became a hallmark in MG!'s career as he had now finally found his name/tag. And thus, out of the mouth of babes... Years later, a fellow musician and friend - by the name of Dwight \"Dewey\" Bennett - would challenge MG! on the grounds of MG!'s forward thinking lyrics and progressive musical direction that, truly, MG! was a visionary and should add such a title to his name. Feeling it all had quite a profound meaning and the undertones of a movement which begun in his heart long ago, MG! did add The Visionary to his moniker and thus...you get MG! the Visionary: part childlike innocence and part dramatic revolutionary. For a period of time it has been noted the artist had been, briefly, also referred to simply as The Visionary but make no mistake...he is still MG! the Visionary. Visionary has cited \"Charlie Peacock, KRS-1, Queen, Seattle music scene, The Roots, U2\" as being strong influences and has a unique hip-hop sound. He plays guitar and sometimes has a live drummer on stage, but he always tries to involve the crowd in his shows. He grew up in Seattle, but has lived in various placed across the country, most recently Cleveland, OH. The Visionary is widely known for his big rhythm, crazy antics while on tour, and heavily animated musical arrangements but can also be heard singing and incorporates many melodic elements to his music. He is an avid producer and audio engineer and has been producing for other artist for years. He now runs his own studio (Reign Room Studios) in Federal Way Washington where he produces original music as well as covers and any other project he can get his hands on. He also licenses music through several licensing houses. His music has been used in conjunction with entities and companies such as: Adidas, Tony Hawk, the Super Bowl, A&B Fitch, AMC Movie Classics, YouTube, and a plethora of companies both large and small worldwide. Through his brief modeling career MG!'s face is seen all over the world from Japan to Germany, from Verizon to Apple and everywhere in between. He has been married and divorced twice, eats food, breathes air, loves God and loves his children. And strangely enough, this was written before he was even divorced twice. Life is stranger than fiction...this much is true!"@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Muthuswami Dikshitar (March 24, 1775 \u2013 October 21, 1835) was a South Indian poet and composer and is one of the Musical Trinity of Carnatic music. His compositions, of which around 500 are commonly known, are noted for their contemplative nature and for capturing the essence of the raga forms through the vainika (veena) style that emphasises gamakas. They are typically in a slower speed (chowka kala). He is also known by his signature name of Guruguha which is also his mudra (can be found in every one of his songs). His compositions are widely sung and played in classical concerts of Carnatic music. The musical trinity consists of Dikshitar, Tyagaraja (1767\u20131847), and Syama Sastri (1762\u20131827) although, unlike the Telugu compositions of the others, his compositions are predominantly in Sanskrit. He also had composed some of his Kritis in Manipravalam.(admixture of Tamil and Sanskrit) Muthuswami Dikshitar was born in Tiruvaruar (of Thiruvaruar district in what is now the state of Tamil Nadu) to a Tamil Iyer Brahmin couple Ramaswami Dikshitar(discoverer of Raaga Hamsadhwani) and Subbamma, as the eldest son. According to the account of Subbarama Dikshitar, Muttuswami Dikshitar was born in the manmatha year, in the month of TamilPanguni under the asterism Krittikaa. He was named after the temple deity, Muttukumaraswamy; legend has it that he was born after his parents prayed for a child in the Vaitheeswaran Temple. He had two younger brothers Baluswami, Chinnaswami and a sister Balambal. In keeping with the tradition, Muthuswami learnt the Sanskrit language, Vedas, and other important religious texts. He obtained his preliminary musical education from his father. While he was still in his teens, his father sent him on a pilgrimage with a wandering monk named Chidambaranatha Yogi to gain musical and philosophical knowledge. Over the course of this pilgrimage, he visited many places in North India and acquired a broad outlook that is reflected in many of his compositions. During their stay in Kashi (Varanasi), his guru Chidambaranatha Yogi, presented Dikshitar with a unique Veena and died shortly thereafter. The sam\u0101dhi of Chidambaranatha Yogi can still be seen in Sri Chakra Lingeshwar temple at the Hanuman Ghat area in Varanasi."@en ;

The current incarnation of the Full Band includes J.W. \"Blu\" Marshall on bass and Stu Wiley on drums. Phil's performance to his eighth grade class of The Beatles Love Me Do first inspired him to enter into music. Phil got his real musical start at age 13 starting a Van Halen-style cover band and started playing local parties. His original high school band the Suburbans was an acclaimed Texas rock trio before breaking up in 1990. Phil graduated from Highland Park High School in 1990, and entered Southwestern University studying History. At Southwestern University in Georgetown, Texas, Pritchett formed the eclectic acoustic duo Romantic Embargo with friend James Dewitt. They played regularly in Austin and surrounding cities and made two recordings, a live tape \"Cut Me Some Slacks\" and a CD \"Central Chilling Station No.5.\" Pritchett went out on his own in 1996 and spent 5 years living in Austin, Texas and playing his original music to fans all over Texas and the South and building a large regional fan base. He started Spitune Records in 1995 and began recording and releasing his music independently. After a brief stint in Nashville, he moved back to Texas and has been touring consistently since 2002, often playing 150 shows a year or more. Pritchett is known for his insightful songs, artistic albums and his live performances. His high-energy shows around Texas and the surrounding areas are known for the performances of songs such as \"Song of the Doorman\", \"High Tide in the Heartland\", \"Luke Skywalker and Indiana Jones\", \"Colorado On Trial,\" \"Tougher Than the Rest\" and the all-time fan-favorites: \"Maria,\" \"Snuff Machine\" (written by ex-Suburbans' member Wes Cunningham), \"Antarctica U.S.A.\" (written by Dewitt now of the Residudes), and \"Drink When I Think\" and \"Rolling\" (both co-written with Chip Evans). In 2006, Pritchett opened Trinidad World Recording in the Fort Worth Stockyards to self-produce his album High Tide in the Heartland. After the release of High Tide, he was asked to produce records for other acts at Trinidad. His producing credits include projects by Texas High Life, Johns Guns, Ty Wick, Magee Payne, Kurt South, J.D. Clark, Kyle Redd, Clay Thrash, Kevin Smith, Slow Rollin' Lows, Zach Huckabee, Mike Mathis, Notorious Gringos, Change of Standard and several of his own albums. Trinidad World Recording is now located in the old Handley post office in Fort Worth. Phil has played with many of the fan favorites in Texas including Jack Ingram, Roger Creager, Honeybrowne and others. In 2007, Phil began selling his albums in MP3 format for $4 each at p2tunes.com. In 2009, Pritchett launched the P2 Podcast from his website. The weekly, hour long show delves into life as a musician, road stories, and discusses current challenges in the changing music business. He is frequently joined by guests, usually people he knows from his time in the industry including Kurt South, Pat Green, Pete Coatney (from Jack Ingram's band), Zach Huckabee, Buddy Huffman (Macon Greyson), Owen Temple, Wes Cunningham and others. 2011 marked the beginning of the \"Trinidad Tribute\" series.

Lee was born in Whitechapel, London. He learned the rudiments of the piano from his elder brother, who was self-taught and preferred to use the black keys rather than the white. As a consequence, he became fluent in keys such as G flat and B natural, before moving on to more standard keys, leaving him with the ability to transpose effortlessly his entire repertoire into any key. He played for many years at The Bull's Head in Barnes, South West London, a few miles from his home in Kingston upon Thames, Surrey. Despite his sketchy knowledge of musical theory, he was a complete master of his instrument, and blessed with large hands, (he could stretch an 11th with ease), his solos ranged from effortless large block chords to delicate single note figures, all played in a lyrical style, and swinging like a garden gate. He was arguably the greatest British exponent of the Erroll Garner piano style, though his playing embraced a much wider compass. He appeared on at least two recordings with Seamen - Phil Seamen Now! . . . Live! (1968) and on Phil Seamen Meets Eddie Gomez (1968), a live recording featuring US bassist Eddie G\u00F3mez.His solo debut, Electric Piano (1971), earned many comparisons to the works of Burt Bacharach. He made at least four other LPs, including Tony Lee Trio (British Jazz Artists Vol. 1), probably the quintessential album of his career (1976), Street of Dreams (1979), Hey There (1992) and The Tony Lee Trio Live at the Station (2002), prior to his death from cancer in 2004. He had a long-lasting association of some 40 years with bassist Tony Archer in the Tony Lee Trio. Lee and Archer also played together in the sextet The Best of British Jazz formed in the early 1970s with Jack Parnell (drums), Kenny Baker (trumpet), Don Lusher (trombone) and Betty Smith (tenor sax). The sextet recorded two albums - The Best of British Jazz and The Very Best of British Jazz."@en ;

She changed her surname to Myles at age 19 after deciding to pursue a career in entertainment. Appearances in TV commercials paid for music demos which weathered countless rejections from her homeland, Canada, until she recorded masters for three songs; \"Who Loves You\" and a video demo for \"Just One Kiss\" directed by photographer Deborah Samuel. With matched financing from songwriting collaborator, Much Music (City TV) DJ and program director Christopher Ward and FACTOR, she signed her first record contract with Atlantic Records in 1987. In fall of 1987, Warner Music Canada's director of artists and repertoire (A&R) Bob Roper sent the three-song video package to all of Warner Music Group's U.S. affiliates which garnered a seven-eight year contract from Atlantic Records (WMG) sight unseen by head of A&R Tunc Erim and Atlantic label founder Ahmet Ertegun. Myles quit a lucrative acting career, co-wrote and recorded the remainder of her first album with collaborator Christopher Ward and producer David Tyson. In 1989, Atlantic Records released her self titled debut album and Myles toured internationally for 18 months. Her first album was awarded the Diamond Award for sales of over one million units; she is the only Canadian debut artist to attain that award. Her first album was reported to have sold upwards of six million copies internationally and remains a classic-selling album to date. Myles' eponymous debut album achieved top 10 hits in several countries around the world beginning with \"Love Is\", \"Still Got This Thing For You\", The only single to hit number one in 1990 in Canada was \"Lover of Mine\". Alannah's fourth American 1990 single, \"Black Velvet.\" hit number one for two weeks with a bullet on the U.S. Billboard Top 40 Chart to become a worldwide classic radio hit. It also won the 1990 Grammy Award for Best Female Rock Vocal Performance. In 1992, Myles was nominated for a second Grammy award for Best Female Rock Vocal Performance for the title track \"Rockinghorse\", the flip side of lead off single, \"Song Instead of a Kiss\" from her second CD Rockinghorse. \"Song Instead Of A Kiss\" was a 60-piece orchestrated ballad that reached number one on several radio stations around the globe but was met with little response in America, whose audiences were accustomed to \"that slow southern style\" of Black Velvet.[citation needed]"@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Clark Kent (born Rodolfo Franklin; September 28, 1967) is an American hip hop DJ, record producer and music executive of Panamanian descent . His crew of DJs is called \"The Supermen\", and his DJ moniker is derived from the name of Superman's alter ego. In the mid-1980s, Clark Kent was rapper Dana Dane's DJ. In 1989 he produced the remix for Troop's hit song \"Spread My Wings.\" Clark scored his first street hit with the Junior M.A.F.I.A. song \"Player's Anthem\" which featured The Notorious B.I.G. and was also the first record that Lil' Kim appeared on. The biggest hit he produced was \"Loverboy\" by Mariah Carey, which peaked at #2 in the US on Billboard's Hot 100 chart. He also produced tracks for artists such as Lil' Kim, The Notorious B.I.G., Mad Skillz, Estelle, Lil' Vicious, Mona Lisa, 50 Cent, Canibus, Slick Rick and Rakim as well as groups such as The Future Sound and Original Flavor, both of which were signed to East West Records and Atlantic Records respectively, both groups having been signed by Clark who was a director of A&R at Atlantic at the time. In the early 1990s, Clark Kent took over the job of MC for the then-titled New Music Seminar, a battle between the best DJs in hip hop. Renaming it \"Clark Kent's Superman Battle for World Supremacy\", he would go on to host the event for a number of years. One of the most famous battles in this arena was the legendary 1994 match between DJ Noize and DJ 8-Ball, which resulted in a landslide victory for Noize and 8-Ball's subsequent humiliation. After the last set, Clark Kent is heard telling the crowd \"I don't need to even TELL you all who won!\" Original Flavor, on their single \"Can I Get Open\", featured a guest appearance by a then little known rapper named Jay-Z. This would lead to further collaborations between the two, as Franklin would go on to produce three tracks on Jay-Z's critically acclaimed debut album, Reasonable Doubt. The tracks were: \"Brooklyn's Finest\", which featured Notorious B.I.G., \"Coming of Age\" and \"Cashmere Thoughts.\" On his \"retirement album\" The Black Album, Jay-Z alludes to Clark Kent's role in helping him break into the industry, in the last song on the album (ironically titled \"My 1st Song\"). He states: \"Clark Kent, that was good lookin' out, nigga.\" Clark accidentally overheard the then unknown rapper Moses Michael Leviy (AKA Jamal Barrow BKA Shyne) rhyming in a barbershop, who, noting the young MC's vocal similarity to Notorious B.I.G., steered him towards Combs and Bad Boy. He is also the cousin of recording artist Foxy Brown. In 2010 Nike commissioned DJ Clark Kent to design a \"Nike Five Boroughs AF1 Low\" pack of special limited edition Nike Air Force 1 shoes and unveiled them at a fully catered block party in Manhattan's SoHo neighborhood on Mercer Street outside the Nike ID store at 21 Mercer."@en ;

Pine is a multi-instrumentalist, also playing the flute, clarinet, bass clarinet and keyboards. On his 2011 album, Europa, he plays almost exclusively bass clarinet. In 1986 Pine's debut album Journey to the Urge Within entered the UK Top 40. He is the principal Founder of the seminal black British big band the Jazz Warriors which he established in 1985 through the community organisation The Abibi Jazz Arts (TAJA). The Jazz Warriors developed out of the Abibi All-Stars community band which did a series of performances at London's Royal Festival Hall foyer during the summer of the International Youth Year 1985. The Jazz Warriors recorded two albums under Pine's leadership: Out of Many, One People which was released on the Antilles division of the Island Records label in 1987 and Afropeans which was released on his own label, Destin-e Records for their 20th anniversary in 2007. The Jazz Warriors Afropeans project was commissioned by the Arts Council of England to commemorate the bicentennary of the Abolition of the Slave Trade Act. Thirty years after Pine planted his idea to start the Jazz Warriors, he put together the Venus Warriors all-female jazz band for a charity performance to raise awareness of the Mary Seacole Memorial Statue Appeal which has been established to erect the first statue of a black heroine outside of London's St Thomas's Hospital. His recent music integrates modern British music like drum and bass and UK garage with contemporary jazz styles. He runs his own band and integrates many contemporary musicians in his performances. He also presents Jazz Crusade on BBC Radio 2, the seventh series of which was broadcast during spring 2007. In 1988 he appeared as himself in a jazz quartet in the Doctor Who serial Silver Nemesis. Pine was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in 2000, and Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 2009 New Year Honours for services to jazz music. He was also awarded an honorary doctorate from the University of Westminster on 6 December 2004. He was awarded an honorary doctorate from the University of Southampton on 15 July 2010.

His pioneering status and outstanding achievements have led to him being referred to as the \"Godfather of Canadian hip hop\". In 1989 he became the first Canadian rapper to have a Top 40 hit, \"Let Your Backbone Slide\". In 1991 he collaborated on the one-off single \"Can't Repress the Cause\", a plea for greater inclusion of hip hop music in the Canadian music scene, with Dance Appeal, a supergroup of Toronto-area musicians that included Devon, Dream Warriors, B-Kool, Michie Mee, Lillian Allen, Eria Fachin, HDV, Dionne, Thando Hyman, Carla Marshall, Messenjah, Jillian Mendez, Lorraine Scott, Lorraine Segato, Self Defense, Leroy Sibbles, Zama and Thyron Lee White. After the success of his 1991 album, The Black Tie Affair, Maestro's career faltered as he attempted to break into the United States market. However, he returned to the Canadian charts in 1998, with the hit singles \"Stick to Your Vision\" and \"416/905 (T.O. Party Anthem)\". In 2000, \"Ever Since\" featured the track \"Bustin Loose\", in which Maestro Fresh Wes teamed up with Kardinal Offishall. In 2005, Maestro covered Lawrence Gowan's song \"A Criminal Mind\" (featuring Infinite); Gowan appears in the video and his vocals are sampled on the track. Gowan also performed the song with Maestro at the Canadian Urban Music Awards in 2006. In 2006 Maestro again made Canadian hip hop history when he and Rochester AKA Juice joined Professor D and The Dope Poet Society on stage in Cannes, France. Together, they become the first Canadian hip hop acts ever to showcase at Midem, the world's largest and most influential annual music industry conference. In 2012, Maestro released his first set of new material in more than seven years with the release of an EP entitled Black Tuxedo. This was followed by an album, Orchestrated Noise in 2013, which features rocker Sam Roberts, opera singer Measha Brueggergosman, rapper Kardinal Offishall, among others. Orchestrated Noise was released under the name Maestro Fresh Wes, reclaiming his original title from the 1980s."@en ;

A self-titled \"musician, poet, and media manipulator\", he is a popular phenomenon on the music scenes of the former Yugoslavia. His songs combine satirical lyrics on human nature and silliness of local politics with a mixture of musical styles including jazz, rock, hip-hop and lately drum and bass, and self-conscious ironic wit; for example, his most popular alias is \"Rambo Amadeus Svjetski Kilo Car\"\u2014 \"Rambo Amadeus the World Kilo Tzar\", formerly \"Rambo Amadeus Svjetski Mega Car\"\u2014 \"Rambo Amadeus the World Mega Tzar\" (RASMC) (changed in 2012 because of his belief in the importance of modesty in an environmentally conscious society). His stage name itself is made from John Rambo and Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. Known also as a \"charming king of jovial pop\", his concerts are never mere repetitions of recorded songs, but a mixture of musical improvisation and humor exploiting all aspects of human nature in a crude manner.

He is featured on the band's greatest hit, the 17-minute In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida (1968), recorded when he was 17. A Boston, Massachusetts native and a violinist, Brann was accepted as a child into the prodigy program at the Boston Symphony Orchestra, but was soon lured away to become a rock guitarist, joining Iron Butterfly at 16. He played with Ron Bushy, Lee Dorman and Doug Ingle from 1968 to 1969. The first album from this lineup, In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida, sold over 30 million copies, was awarded the first platinum award and stayed on the Billboard magazine charts for nearly three years. With arrangement assistance from Dorman, Brann wrote the song \"Termination,\" which was featured on the album. The album's mini-bio, written when he was 17, tells of an acting ambition he once had, clothing and food preference and the ease with which rock 'n roll artists were able to arrange sexual encounters (usually with groupies). It reads: \"Although music has always been his one great love, Erik studied drama and before joining the Butterfly, his acting ability had landed him the lead role in a local play. ...Erik hopes to, one day, continue in the acting field. Right now, however, his only concern is the Iron Butterfly, turtleneck sweaters, bananas and the fairer sex.\" In 1970, Brann and former Iron Butterfly member Darryl DeLoach, formed Flintwhistle. This band performed live for about a year before breaking up. Between 1972 and 1973, Brann worked solely in the studio on various demos. In 1973, he recorded a couple demos with MCA Records which can be found on bootleg sites. Notable songs from these demos include early versions of \"Hard Miseree\", \"Am I Down\", and \"Scorching Beauty\". In 1974, he reunited with Ron Bushy to form a new version of Iron Butterfly. The 1975 LP Scorching Beauty featured Brann on guitars and vocals, Bushy on drums, Philip Taylor Kramer on bass and Howard Reitzes on keyboards. The band released Sun and Steel in late 1975 with Bill DeMartines replacing Reitzes on keyboards. Neither album sold well, and the band disbanded shortly afterward (around summer 1977). Brann occasionally reunited with Iron Butterfly for concerts, and was working on his solo debut when he died of a heart attack in July 25, 2003, in Los Angeles. This followed an ongoing struggle with complications from a birth defect that Brann had battled for years."@en ;

Her repertoire was restricted to few composers other than Fr\u00E9d\u00E9ric Chopin and even her Chopin repertoire was not large. For example, she did not play the Piano Concerto No. 1 in E minor live until 1951, and she never played the F minor concerto at all, as she did not like it. She was proven to be the real pianist in a recording of the E minor concerto that was misattributed to Dinu Lipatti. The recording was released in 1966 by EMI, and on the 1971 British release was a note to the effect that, although the name of the conductor and orchestra were not known, there was no doubt the soloist was Lipatti. The BBC broadcast the recording in 1981, and a listener wrote in, noting the similarities between it and a Supraphon recording from the early 1950s with Czerny-Stefa\u0144ska under V\u00E1clav Smet\u00E1\u010Dek. Tests revealed these were one and the same recording. The so-called Lipatti recording was withdrawn. Halina Czerny-Stefa\u0144ska was a juror in many piano competitions including the Leeds International Pianoforte Competition, the International Tchaikovsky Competition, and the Marguerite Long-Jacques Thibaud Competition. She was also a juror at the International Chopin Piano Competition for many years. Her daughter, with husband Ludwik Stefa\u0144ski (1917\u20131982) is El\u017Cbieta Stefa\u0144ska-\u0141ukowicz (b. 1943), a harpsichordist and professor at the Academy of Music in Krak\u00F3w, Poland. Halina Czerny-Stefa\u0144ska died in Krak\u00F3w on July 1, 2001."@en ;

He trained his voice, learning the techniques that would enable him to develop his distinctively percussive vocal style. He also played day-long romerias and at the Festival of Singers of the Americas in Guant\u00E1namo. Vivanco first came to Havana when he was 23 years old. The Bis Music label at the Santa Clara song festival spotted him and offered him the possibility to make his first solo album in 2002 called Lo Tengo To' Pensa'o, a mix of Brazilian music, pop and reggae. His song and the accompanying video clip \"Cimarr\u00F3n\" became popular. \"Cimarr\u00F3n\" (literally, \"one who lives on mountaintops\") refers to African slaves who ran away from their Spanish masters. In 2006, Vivanco recorded his second solo album, La Isla Milagrosa, produced by Descemer Bueno and Roberto Carcass\u00E9s. In recent times Vivanco has started to distance himself from his funkier, poppier tunes in favour of music that is more \"Santiaguera\" (from Santiago), more Cuban, more rhythmic \u2013 more traditional. Vivanco has performed in France. In 2003 he performed at Les Transmusicales de Rennes festival, then in 2004 at the Paleo Festival de Nyon, at the Cuban night of Les Nuits de Fourvi\u00E8re de Lyon, and in August 2005 he played at the Vence festival Les Nuits du Sud."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Andrew Kennedy \"Andy\" Irvine (born 14 June 1942) is an Irish folk musician, singer-songwriter, and a founding member of popular bands Sweeney's Men, Planxty, Patrick Street, Mozaik, LAPD and Usher's Island. He is an accomplished player of the mandolin, mandola, bouzouki and harmonica, and occasionally plays the hurdy-gurdy. He has been influential in folk music for over five decades, during which he collected and recorded a large repertoire of songs and tunes he meticulously researched and assembled from books, folk-song collectors and old recordings rooted in the Irish, English, Scottish, Eastern European, Australian and American old-time and folk traditions. He often sets these traditional songs to new music, and also writes songs about his personal experiences or about the lives and struggles of his heroes: Michael Davitt, Mary Harris \"Mother\" Jones, Douglas Mawson, Raoul Wallenberg, Emiliano Zapata, and many others. Imbued with a deep sense of social justice, Irvine often selects or writes songs that are presented from the victim's perspective,:13 either as groups of people: the emigrants; the brutalized migrant workers; the exploited textile strikers or coalminers; or as single individuals: the woman seduced and betrayed by an unfaithful man or disowned by her father; the destitute young man ostracized or murdered on the order of his sweetheart\u2019s rich father; the down-on-his-luck farmer or the unemployed worker; the young man inveigled by the army's recruiting sergeant; the scapegoats. In his songs, Irvine also denounces worker deaths and industrial diseases, and laments the plight of hunted animals. His repertoire includes humorous songs, but also bittersweet ones of unrequited love and of lovers cruelly separated or dramatically reunited; other songs feature famous racehorses, men or women masquerading in various disguises, a fantastical fox preying on young maidens, and the violent lives of outlaws. As a child actor, Irvine honed his performing talent from an early age and learned the classical guitar, a skill he later applied to playing the songs of Woody Guthrie, also adopting the latter\u2019s other instruments: harmonica and mandolin. After extending Guthrie\u2019s picking technique to the mandolin,:20 he further developed his playing of this instrument\u2014and, later, of the mandola and the bouzouki\u2014into a richly harmonic, decorative style:38 and embraced the modes and rhythms of Bulgarian folk music. Along with Johnny Moynihan and D\u00F3nal Lunny, Irvine is one of the pioneers who adapted the Greek bouzouki\u2014with a new tuning\u2014into an Irish instrument, and has contributed to advancing the design of his instruments in cooperation with English luthier Stefan Sobell. He also plays a hurdy-gurdy made for him in 1972 by Peter Abnett, another English luthier.:119,170 Although touring mainly as a soloist, Irvine has also enjoyed great success in pursuing collaborations through many projects that have influenced contemporary folk music, with notable performers such as Paul Brady,Kevin Burke,Jackie Daly, Dick Gaughan,D\u00F3nal Lunny, Matt Molloy,Christy Moore,Liam O'Flynn, Davy Spillane andBill Whelan, among many others. He continues to tour and perform extensively in Ireland, Great Britain, Europe, North and South America, Japan, Australia and New Zealand."@en ;

The name Jovanotti derives from the plural form of the Italian word giovanotto (\"young man\"), i. e., giovanotti. Cherubini initially chose \"Joe Vanotti\" as his stage name, but a promotional poster for a night club incorrectly billed him as \"Jovanotti\" and the name stuck. (The spelling Jovanotti is anglicized; the letter J is rarely used in Italian) Jovanotti is commonly known to his fans by the diminutive form \"Jova\", and often refers to himself that way in promotional items and on his new Web TV channel Jova.TV, which launched October 2, 2014. Jovanotti gradually departed from his early mix of hip hop, rap and disco, taking in funk, world music and even classical arrangements and ska influences. As his musical influences changed, so too did his lyrics, which over time began to increasingly address philosophical, religious and political issues, which are more typical of the Italian cantautore tradition. His social and political commitment increased as well. Some of his earlier work is also closer to keyboard-heavy 1980s pop. Most of his songs are sung in Italian; he also released a Spanish-language greatest hits album. His live album includes a short version of the Sugarhill Gang's \"Rapper's Delight.\" Jovanotti appears on several international compilations, most notably Red Hot + Rhapsody, a 1998 tribute to George Gershwin, on which he performed \"I Got Rhythm\". Jovanotti has also appeared in one of Luciano Pavarotti's charity concerts in 1996."@en ;

In 2000, his solo debut album F\u00EDjate Bien won three Latin Grammy Awards. According to his record label, Juanes has sold more than 15 million albums worldwide. Raised in Medell\u00EDn, Colombia, Juanes began playing guitar at age seven. When Juanes was 15, he started his first band, Ekhymosis, in 1988, which went on to release five albums, achieving recognition in his native Colombia. The track \"S\u00F3lo\" from the album Ni\u00F1o Gigante in 1992 was very popular. In 1997 after the band broke up, Juanes continued solo and in 2000 he released the album, F\u00EDjate Bien, which earned him three Latin Grammys. His follow-up album, Un D\u00EDa Normal, was released in 2002 and was later certified platinum in multiple countries throughout Latin America. Juanes' third album, Mi Sangre (2004), which became an international bestseller, managing to position well in a number of countries around the world, achieved success due to the single \"La Camisa Negra\". He has since released La Vida... Es Un Ratico (2007) and P.A.R.C.E. (2010). On May 29, 2012 Juanes released the album Juanes MTV Unplugged.

His given name may also be cited as Kheaven, a spelling he later adopted. The alias \"k-os\", spelled with a lower case \"k\", was intended to be less aggressive than the pseudonyms of other rappers whose names were all upper case, such as KRS-One. It is an acronym for \"Knowledge of Self,\" although in a later interview he said that it originally stood for \"Kevin's Original Sound.\" k-os' music incorporates a wide variety of music genres, including rap, funk, rock, and reggae. The lyrics frequently focus on promoting a \"positive message\" while at times expressing criticism of mainstream hip hop culture's obsession with money, fame and glorification of violence.A musician as well as a producer, k-os has written and produced nearly every part of all four of his albums. k-os usually performs with a live band, something that is uncommon in the hip hop genre. He sometimes plays guitar and keyboard both during live performances and in the studio. k-os received his first musical exposure with the single \"Musical Essence\", released in 1993. After the release of his second single \"Rise Like the Sun\" in 1996, he withdrew from the industry because he was dissatisfied with his musical style. He reappeared briefly in 1999 and released his debut album Exit in 2002. The album received positive reviews but sold relatively few copies. He released his second album Joyful Rebellion in 2004, which received platinum status in Canada. A third album, Atlantis: Hymns for Disco, was released in 2006 and also went platinum.

He is among a group of notable young tropical singers and soneros who have woven a blend of pop, rock, gospel music, R&B, hip-hop, and reggaet\u00F3n elements into their salsa, a group that includes Huey Dunbar, Charlie Cruz, Kevin Ceballo, and Obie Berm\u00FAdez. Siblings include a younger sister, Jaqueline Negr\u00F3n (Jackie Negr\u00F3n), who is also a singer and dancer, and a brother, David Negr\u00F3n. Frankie attended Newark Arts High School in the early 90s gaining notoriety as part of an R&B singing group called Base Harmony (the other members at this time were Sean Pulley, Dionte Sutton, Kwhan Jarmond, and Bobby Bright). As part of Base Harmony, Frankie sang for audiences in the New Jersey Senate, Newark City Hall, The United in Group Harmony Association, and various clubs and venues around the tri-state area. It was during this period with Base Harmony that Frankie reinforced his already great vocal talents with an understanding of soul singing, complex group harmony, and stage performance that he'd draw from later in his musical career. Fluent in both English and Spanish, Frankie was raised in New Jersey primarily as an English speaker, but developed his initial love of salsa from his father's record collection. He sings almost exclusively in Spanish, but converses and jokes with his audiences in both languages. The first of his seven studio albums to date, Con Amor Se Gana (roughly translatable as \"Love Conquers All\"), was released in May 1997. His last salsa release, Mejor Que Nunca (\"Better than Ever\"), was released in August 2006. Frankie Negr\u00F3n also has tried his hand at acting. Paul Simon, conducting an audition of Base Harmony for the Broadway musical The Capeman, immediately recognized Frankie as someone worth watching and gave him a supporting role in the play as part of the \"Doo Wop Group Ensemble\" (cast under the name Frank Negron ). Frankie and members of Base Harmony also participated in the recording of the play's soundtrack CD \"Songs From The Capeman\". Also, in 2000 Frankie starred as a struggling artist in the South Bronx in Val Lik's independent film, Boricua's Bond . His singing career has been far more successful, evidenced by two Gold Album awards, for Con Amor Se Gana and No Me Compares (\"Don't Compare Me\"), and nine Billboard Top 40 Hot Latin Tracks to date. Frankie has also earned Grammy Award nominations, Billboard Award nods and two Premio Lo Nuestro Awards for Song of the Year. In an All Music Guide review, Frankie is referred to as \"the genre's next definitive voice.\" Negr\u00F3n appeared on the American soap opera One Life to Live on August 5, 2009 to perform music from his then upcoming album Independence Day. on Airgo Music. The Jimmy Greco produced Independence Day was released in September, 2009 as the singer's first crossover into the English market. Negr\u00F3n's CD got enthusiastic reviews, with Jon Pareles of the New York Times highlighting the CD in his Fall record release roundup.

In 2008, Luca began an online guitar course titled Luca Turilli's Neoclassical Revelation. The course takes its name from his neoclassical playing style. On every Rhapsody of Fire album, Luca is the only lyricist and composes all the music with the keyboardist, Alex Staropoli (except for Il Canto del Vento written, lyrics and music, by the vocalist, Fabio Lione) and plays most of the lead guitars. He composes all the music for both his solo projects. He plays guitars on his solo trilogy and keyboards with Luca Turilli's Dreamquest featuring Dominique Leurquin as the guitarist. On August 2011, Turilli and Staropoli proceeded to a friendly split. Alex agreed to go on as Rhapsody of Fire, while Luca decided to move on as Luca Turilli's Rhapsody, adding his name on top of the logo because of copyright reasons and old legal settlements and stopping definitely the Luca Turilli band."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Hubert-F\u00E9lix Thi\u00E9faine ([yb\u025B\u0281 feliks tjef\u025Bn]) is a French pop-rock singer and songwriter. He was born on 21 July 1948 in the town of Dole in the Jura d\u00E9partement. Mostly shunned by television and radio, he has built over the years \u2013 through word of mouth and frequent touring \u2013 a considerable following which allowed him to fill the 17,000-seater Palais omnisports de Paris-Bercy for an anniversary concert in 1998. In recent years he has been increasingly name-dropped as an influence by the latest generation of performers in France, and was the subject of a tribute album of covers in 2002. He has been performing since the late 1960s and releasing records since 1978. Musically, Thi\u00E9faine draws mostly from classic rock, with rare nods to the latest musical trends, and generally leaves the arranging to a collaborator. His songs are most notable for instantly recognisable lyrics, with their trademarks streams of consciousness, surreal and often extreme or dark imagery, often tinged with comedy, cynicism, literary references, neologisms and liberal use of scientific, long or foreign words. The lyrical mayhem sometimes spreads into comically long song titles, such as Enferm\u00E9 dans les cabinets (avec la fille mineure des 80 chasseurs), or Exercice de simple provocation avec 33 fois le mot \u00AB coupable \u00BB. His education in a Catholic boarding school has also left deep traces which surface in his lyrics in the form of biblical quotations and cheerfully blasphemous lyrics. His avowed influences include L\u00E9o Ferr\u00E9, Lou Reed, and many French, Anglo-Saxon and German novelists and poets, with a preference for romantic literature."@en ;

She was born in Alto Lucero, Veracruz and started her career in Mexico City in 1970. Her songs usually take a stance against Mexico's sexist male culture.

Born in Rio de Janeiro, her father was a serenader who played guitar, and her mother was an amateur singer. Elizete began working at an early age and between 1930 and 1935 was a store clerk and hairdresser among other things. She was discovered by Jacob do Bandolim at her 16th birthday party, to which he was brought by her cousin Pedro, a popular figure among the musicians of the day.

The week after she was hired by the station to appear on a weekly program. Following this, she continued to perform on various shows with multiple radio stations. In the 1960s she had her own radio show. Due to her low pay, in 1939 she began to perform at clubs, movie theaters and other venues. She met with considerable success and her popularity increased significantly. In 1950, thanks to the support of Ataulfo Alves, she recorded Bra\u00E7os vazios (Acir Alves and Edgard G.

In 1958, Cardoso was invited by Vinicius de Moraes to be the singer of an album of songs written by himself and Tom Jobim. Can\u00E7\u00E3o do Amor Demais became the first album of bossa nova music, launching the new genre. The album was released on the Festa label. While Cardoso was not primarily considered a bossa nova singer, she is the vocalist on the original version of the bossa classic Manh\u00E3 de Carnaval from the Orfeu Negro soundtrack. Elizete continued to sing and act with great success until her death. By the end of her life she had released well over 40 albums in Brazil, Portugal and other countries. During almost seven decades of artistic life, she interpreted many forms of music but her base was always samba, which she performed with great personality, and which earned her nicknames such as: A Noiva do Samba-Can\u00E7\u00E3o (the Bride of Samba), Lady do Samba, A Magnifica (the Magnificent One), and the one most connected with her name, A Divina (the Divine One). Cardoso died of cancer at the age of 69."@en ;

Since the late 1970s, Childish has been prolific in creating music, writing and visual art. He has lead and played in bands including the Pop Rivets, The Milkshakes, Thee Headcoats, and the Musicians of the British Empire, primarily working in the genres of garage rock, punk and surf. He is a consistent advocate for amateurism and free emotional expression. Childish co-founded the Stuckism art movement with Charles Thomson in 1999, which he left in 2001. Since then a new evaluation of Childish's standing in the art world has been under way, culminating with the publication of a critical study of Childish's working practice by the artist and writer Neal Brown, with an introduction by Peter Doig, which describes Childish as \"one of the most outstanding, and often misunderstood, figures on the British art scene\". He is a visiting lecturer at Rochester Independent College. In July 2014 Childish was awarded an honorary Doctor of Arts Degree from the University of Kent. He is known for his explicit and prolific work \u2013 he has detailed his love life and childhood sexual abuse, notably in his early poetry and the novels My Fault (1996), Notebooks of a Naked Youth (1997), Sex Crimes of the Futcher (2004) \u2013 The Idiocy of Idears (2007), and in several of his songs, notably in the instrumental \"Paedophile\" (1992) (featuring a photograph of the man who sexually abused him on the front cover) and \"Every Bit of Me\" (1993). From 1981 until 1985 Childish had a relationship with artist Tracey Emin. Thirty years after Childish's first musical releases with Thee Milkshakes and Thee Mighty Caesars, a crop of lo-fi, surf rock and punk groups with psychedelic subtexts has surfaced referencing the aesthetic established by Childish in both their band names and in various aspects of their sonic aesthetic: Thee Oh Sees, Thee Open Sex, Thee Tsunamis, Thee Dang Dangs and many others."@en ;

In 1997, he signed a contract with DreamWorks Records, for which he recorded two albums.

He was the only member of the band to have formal musical training. His aggressive lead sound influenced many rock bass players. He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of The Who in 1990. Entwistle's instrumental approach used pentatonic lead lines, and a then-unusual treble-rich sound (\"full treble, full volume\") created by roundwound RotoSound steel bass strings. He was nicknamed \"The Ox\" and \"Thunderfingers,\" the latter because his digits became a blur across the four-string fretboard. In 2011, he was voted the greatest bassist of all time in a Rolling Stone reader's poll. According to the The Biography Channel, Entwistle is considered by many to be the best bass guitarist that ever lived, and considered to have done for the bass what Jimi Hendrix did for the guitar."@en ;

He failed to find a wide audience during his lifetime, but his work has gradually achieved wider notice and recognition. Drake signed to Island Records when he was 20 years old and was a student at the University of Cambridge, and released his debut album, Five Leaves Left, in 1969. By 1972, he had recorded two more albums\u2014Bryter Layter and Pink Moon. Neither sold more than 5,000 copies on initial release. Drake's reluctance to perform live, or be interviewed, contributed to his lack of commercial success. No footage of the adult Drake has ever been released; only still photographs and home footage from his childhood. Drake suffered from major depression. This was often reflected in his lyrics. On completion of his third album, 1972's Pink Moon, he withdrew from both live performance and recording, retreating to his parents' home in rural Warwickshire. On 25 November 1974, at the age of 26, Drake died from an overdose of approximately 30 amitriptyline pills, a prescribed antidepressant. His cause of death was determined to be suicide. Drake's music remained available through the mid-1970s, but the 1979 release of the retrospective album Fruit Tree allowed his back catalogue to be reassessed. By the mid-1980s Drake was being credited as an influence by such artists as Robert Smith, David Sylvian and Peter Buck. In 1985, The Dream Academy reached the UK and US charts with \"Life in a Northern Town\", a song written for and dedicated to Drake. By the early 1990s, he had come to represent a certain type of \"doomed romantic\" musician in the UK music press. His first biography was published in 1997, followed in 1998 by the documentary film A Stranger Among Us."@en ;

Regarded as one of the most important figures in French popular music, he was renowned for his often provocative and scandalous releases, as well as his diverse artistic output, which embodied genres ranging from jazz, mambo, world, chanson, pop and y\u00E9-y\u00E9, to rock and roll, progressive rock, reggae, electronic, disco, new wave, and funk. Gainsbourg's varied musical style and individuality make him difficult to categorize although his legacy has been firmly established and he is often regarded as one of the world's most influential popular musicians. His lyrical work incorporated a vast amount of clever word play to hoodwink the listener, often for humorous, provocative, satirical or subversive reasons. Common types of word play in his songs include mondegreen, onomatopoeia, rhyme, spoonerism, dysphemism, paraprosdokian and pun. Through the course of his career, Gainsbourg wrote over 550 songs, which have been covered more than a thousand times by a wide range of artists.

Jagged Little Pill was a departure from Morissette's previous work and featured rock genres. Released in 1995 Jagged Little Pill was a huge success and sold more than 33 million units globally. Her following album, Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie, was released in 1998.

During a career spanning six decades, she has become an icon in multiple fields of entertainment, winning numerous awards, and has earned her recognition as Mother of All Contemporary Pop Divas or Queen of The Divas. She has been recognized with two Academy Awards, ten Grammy Awards including the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award and the Grammy Legend Award, five Emmy Awards including one Daytime Emmy, a Special Tony Award, an American Film Institute award, a Kennedy Center Honors prize, four Peabody Awards, The Presidential Medal Of Freedom and eleven Golden Globes.

Streisand is one of the best-selling music artists of all time, with more than 72.5 million albums in the United States and with a total of 245 million records sold worldwide, making her the best-selling female artist among the top-selling artists recognized by the Recording Industry Association of America, (The only female in the top ten, and the only artist outside of the rock 'n' roll genre.) After beginning a successful recording career in the 1960s, Streisand ventured into film by the end of the decade. She starred in the critically acclaimed Funny Girl, for which she won the Academy Award and Golden Globe Award for Best Actress. Her other films include The Owl and the Pussycat, The Way We Were, and A Star Is Born, for which she received her second Academy Award, composing music for the love theme \"Evergreen\", the first woman to be honored as a composer.

The film won an Oscar for Best Score and a Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture Musical; Streisand received the Golden Globe Award for Best Director, the first (and to date only) woman to win that award. The RIAA and Billboard recognize Streisand as holding the record for the most top-ten albums of any female recording artist: a total of 33 since 1963.

Jones was a multi-instrumentalist, with his main instruments being the guitar, harmonica and keyboards. His innovative use of traditional or folk instruments, such as the sitar and marimba, was integral to the unique sound of the band. Although he was originally the leader of the group, Jones's fellow band members Mick Jagger and Keith Richards soon overshadowed him, especially after they became a successful songwriting team. Jones developed a serious drug problem over the years and his role in the band steadily diminished.

Jones died less than a month later by drowning in the swimming pool at his home on Cotchford Farm in Hartfield, East Sussex.

After signing with Capitol Records in 1962, Wilson wrote or co-wrote more than two dozen Top 40 hits for the group. Because of his unorthodox approaches to song composition and arrangement and mastery of recording techniques, he is widely acknowledged as one of the most innovative and influential creative forces in popular music by critics and musicians alike. In the mid-1960s, Wilson composed, arranged and produced Pet Sounds (1966), considered one of the greatest albums ever made. The intended follow-up to Pet Sounds, Smile, was cancelled for various reasons, which included Wilson's deteriorating mental health. As he suffered through multiple nervous breakdowns, Wilson's contributions to the Beach Boys diminished, and his erratic behavior led to tensions with the band. After years of treatment and recuperation, he began performing and recording consistently as a solo artist. On the Beach Boys' 50th anniversary, Wilson briefly returned to record and perform with the group. He remains a member of their corporation, Brother Records Incorporated. Wilson is credited as a major innovator in the field of music production, and as the principal originator of the California Sound. According to Erik Davis, \"Not only did [he] write a soundtrack to the early '60s, but Brian let loose a delicate and joyful art pop unique in music history and presaged the mellowness so fundamental to '70s California pop.\" The A.V. Club wrote that Wilson was among \"studio rats ... [that] set the pace for how pop music could and should sound in the Flower Power era: at once starry-eyed and wistful.\" Only 21 years old when he received the freedom to produce his own records with total creative autonomy, he ignited an explosion of like-minded California producers, supplanting New York as the center of popular records, and becoming the first rock producer to use the studio as a discrete instrument. His honors include being inducted into the 1988 Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and winning Grammy Awards for Brian Wilson Presents Smile (2004) and The Smile Sessions (2011). In lists published by Rolling Stone, Wilson ranked 52 for the \"100 Greatest Singers of All Time\" in 2008 and 12 for the \"100 Greatest Songwriters of All Time\" in 2015. In 2012, music publication NME ranked Wilson number 8 in its \"50 Greatest Producers Ever\" list, elaborating \"few consider quite how groundbreaking Brian Wilson's studio techniques were in the mid-60s.\" He is an occasional actor and voice actor, having appeared in television shows, films, and other artists' music videos. His life was portrayed in the 2014 biopic Love & Mercy, which received a wide release in 2015."@en ;

His musical work was conducted with a rotating ensemble of musicians called the Magic Band (1965\u20131982), with whom he recorded 13 studio albums. Noted for his powerful singing voice and his wide vocal range, Van Vliet also played the harmonica, saxophone and numerous other wind instruments. His music integrated blues, rock, psychedelia, and jazz with contemporary experimental composition and the avant-garde; many of his works have been classified as \"art rock.\" Beefheart was also known for often constructing myths about his life and for exercising an almost dictatorial control over his supporting musicians. An artistic prodigy in his childhood, Van Vliet later developed an eclectic musical taste during his teen years in Lancaster, California, and formed \"a mutually useful but volatile\" friendship with musician Frank Zappa, with whom he sporadically competed and collaborated. He began performing with his Captain Beefheart persona in 1964 and joined the original Magic Band line-up, initiated by Alexis Snouffer, in 1965. The group drew attention with their cover of Bo Diddley's \"Diddy Wah Diddy\", which became a regional hit. It was followed by their acclaimed debut album Safe as Milk, released in 1967 on Buddah Records. After being dropped by two consecutive record labels, they signed to Zappa's Straight Records. As producer, Zappa granted Beefheart unrestrained artistic freedom in making 1969's Trout Mask Replica, which was ranked 58th in Rolling Stone magazine's 2003 list of the 500 greatest albums of all time. Beefheart followed this up with the album Lick My Decals Off, Baby, released in 1970. In 1974, frustrated by lack of commercial success, he released two albums of more conventional rock music that were critically panned; this move, combined with not having been paid for a European tour, and years of enduring Beefheart's abusive behavior, led the entire band to quit. Beefheart eventually formed a new Magic Band with a group of younger musicians and regained contemporary approval through three final albums: Shiny Beast (1978), Doc at the Radar Station (1980) and Ice Cream for Crow (1982). Van Vliet has been described as \"one of modern music's true innovators\" with \"a singular body of work virtually unrivalled in its daring and fluid creativity.\" Although he achieved little commercial or mainstream critical success, he sustained a cult following as a \"highly significant\" and \"incalculable\" influence on an array of new wave, punk, post-punk, experimental and alternative rock musicians. Known for his enigmatic personality and relationship with the public, Van Vliet made few public appearances after his retirement from music in 1982. He pursued a career in art, an interest that originated in his childhood talent for sculpture, and a venture which proved to be his most financially secure. His expressionist paintings and drawings command high prices, and have been exhibited in art galleries and museums across the world. Van Vliet died in 2010, having suffered from multiple sclerosis for many years."@en ;

Dropping out of school, he learned to operate lights for vaudeville and to improvise accompaniment for silent films at a local movie theater in his home town of Red Bank, New Jersey. By 16 he increasingly played jazz piano at parties, resorts and other venues. In 1924 he went to Harlem, where his performing career expanded; he toured with groups to the major jazz cities of Chicago, St. Louis and Kansas City. In 1929 he joined Bennie Moten's band in Kansas City, and played with them until Moten's death in 1935. That year Basie formed his own jazz orchestra, and in 1936 took them to Chicago for a long engagement and their first recording. He led the group for almost 50 years, creating innovations like the use of two \"split\" tenor saxophones, emphasizing the rhythm section, riffing with a big band, using arrangers to broaden their sound, and others. Many musicians came to prominence under his direction, including the tenor saxophonists Lester Young and Herschel Evans, the guitarist Freddie Green, trumpeters Buck Clayton and Harry \"Sweets\" Edison and singers Jimmy Rushing and Joe Williams. Basie's theme songs were \"One O'Clock Jump\", developed in 1935 in the early days of his band, and later \"April in Paris\"."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Douglas Glenn Colvin (September 18, 1951 \u2013 June 5, 2002), known professionally as Dee Dee Ramone, was a German-American songwriter and musician, best known as founding member, songwriter and bassist for punk rock band the Ramones. Though nearly all of the Ramones' songs were credited equally to all the band members, Dee Dee was the band's most prolific lyricist and composer, writing many of the band's best-known songs, such as \"53rd & 3rd\", \"Commando\", \"Rockaway Beach\", and \"Poison Heart\". He was initially the band's lead vocalist, though his (then) inability to sing and play bass at the same time resulted in original drummer Joey Ramone taking over the lead vocalist duties. Dee Dee was the band's bassist and songwriter from 1974 until 1989, when he left to pursue a short-lived career in hip hop music under the name Dee Dee King. He soon returned to his punk roots and released three solo albums featuring brand-new songs, many of which were later recorded by the Ramones. He toured the world playing his new songs, Ramones songs and some old favorites in small clubs, and continued to write songs for the Ramones until 1996, when the band officially retired. Dee Dee struggled with drug addiction for much of his life, particularly heroin. He began using drugs as a teenager, and continued to use for the majority of his adult life. He appeared clean in the early 1990s but began using heroin again some time later. He died from a heroin overdose on June 5, 2002."@en ;

On a few occasions, he also played the clarinet and piccolo. Dolphy was one of several multi-instrumentalists to gain prominence in the 1960s. He was one of the first important bass clarinet soloists in jazz, extended the vocabulary and boundaries of the alto saxophone, and was among the earliest significant jazz flute soloists. His improvisational style was characterized by the use of wide intervals, in addition to using an array of extended techniques to reproduce human- and animal-like effects which almost literally made his instruments speak. Although Dolphy's work is sometimes classified as free jazz, his compositions and solos were often rooted in conventional (if highly abstracted) tonal bebop harmony and melodic lines that suggest the influences of modern classical composers B\u00E9la Bart\u00F3k and Igor Stravinsky."@en ;

Two years later, Cassidy's music was brought to the attention of British audiences when her versions of \"Fields of Gold\" and \"Over the Rainbow\" were played by Mike Harding and Terry Wogan on BBC Radio 2. Following the overwhelming response, a camcorder recording of \"Over the Rainbow\", taken at Blues Alley in Washington by her friend Bryan McCulley, was shown on BBC Two's Top of the Pops 2. Shortly afterwards, the compilation album Songbird climbed to the top of the UK Albums Charts, almost three years after its initial release. The chart success in the United Kingdom and Ireland led to increased recognition worldwide; her posthumously released recordings, including three UK number 1 records, have sold more than ten million copies.

Her self-titled debut album Melissa Etheridge was released in 1988 and became an underground hit. The album peaked at #22 on the Billboard 200, and its lead single, \"Bring Me Some Water\", garnered Etheridge her first Grammy Award nomination for Best Rock Vocal Performance, Female. In 1993, Etheridge won her first Grammy award for her single \"Ain't It Heavy\" from her third album, Never Enough. Later that year, she released what would become her mainstream breakthrough album, Yes I Am. The album featured three Top 40 hits, including \"I'm the Only One\" (No. 8) and \"Come to My Window\" (No. 25), the latter which scored Etheridge her second Grammy award. Yes I Am peaked at No. 15 on the Billboard 200, and spent 138 weeks on the chart, earning a RIAA certification of 6x Platinum, her largest to date. In October 2004, Etheridge was diagnosed with breast cancer, and underwent surgery and chemotherapy. At the 2005 Grammy Awards, she made a return to the stage and, although bald from chemotherapy, performed a tribute to Janis Joplin with the song \"Piece of My Heart\". Etheridge's performance was widely lauded, with India.Arie writing \"I Am Not My Hair\" about Etheridge. Later that year, Etheridge released her first compilation album, Greatest Hits: The Road Less Traveled. The album was a huge success, peaking at No. 14 on the Billboard 200, and going Gold almost immediately. Her latest studio album is This Is M.E.. Etheridge is known for her mixture of \"confessional lyrics, pop-based folk-rock, and raspy, smoky vocals.\" She has also been an iconic gay and lesbian activist since her public coming out in January 1993.

	dbo:abstract	"McKinley Morganfield (April 4, 1913 \u2013 April 30, 1983), known by his stage name Muddy Waters, was an American blues musician who is often cited as the \"father of modern Chicago blues\". Muddy Waters grew up on Stovall Plantation near Clarksdale, Mississippi, and by age seventeen was playing the guitar at parties, emulating local blues artists Son House and Robert Johnson. He was recorded in Mississippi by Alan Lomax for the Library of Congress in 1941. In 1943, he moved to Chicago with the hope of becoming a full-time professional musician, eventually recording, in 1946, first for Columbia Records and then for Aristocrat Records, a newly formed label run by brothers Leonard and Phil Chess. In the early 1950s, Muddy and his band, Little Walter Jacobs on harmonica, Jimmy Rogers on guitar, Elgin Evans on drums and Otis Spann on piano, recorded a series of blues classics, some with bassist/songwriter Willie Dixon, including \"Hoochie Coochie Man\", \"I Just Want to Make Love to You\" and \"I'm Ready\". In 1958, Muddy headed to England, helping to lay the foundations of the subsequent blues boom there, and in 1960 performed at the Newport Jazz Festival, recorded and released as his first live album, At Newport 1960. Muddy's influence is tremendous, not just on blues and rhythm and blues but on rock and roll, hard rock, folk, jazz, and country; his use of amplification is often cited as the link between Delta blues and rock and roll."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Neil Percival Young, OC OM (born November 12, 1945) is a Canadian singer-songwriter and musician. He began performing in a group covering Shadows instrumentals in Canada in 1960, before moving to California in 1966, where he co-founded the band Buffalo Springfield together with Stephen Stills and Richie Furay, and later joined Crosby, Stills & Nash in 1969. He released his first album in 1968 and has since forged a successful and acclaimed solo career, spanning over 45 years and 35 studio albums, with a continuous and uncompromizing exploration of musical styles. The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame website describes Young as \"one of rock and roll's greatest songwriters and performers\". He was inducted into the Hall of Fame twice, first as a solo artist in 1995, and second as a member of Buffalo Springfield in 1997. Young's music is characterized by his distinctive guitar work, deeply personal lyrics and characteristic alto or high tenor singing voice. Although he accompanies himself on several different instruments, including piano and harmonica, his idiosyncratic electric and acoustic guitar playing are the defining characteristics of a varyingly ragged and melodic sound. While Young has experimented with differing music styles throughout a varied career, including electronic music, most of his best known work is either acoustic folk-rock and country rock or electric, amplified hard rock (most often in collaboration with the band Crazy Horse). Musical styles such as alternative rock and grunge also adopted elements from Young. His influence has caused some to dub him the \"Godfather of Grunge\". Young has directed (or co-directed) a number of films using the pseudonym Bernard Shakey, including Journey Through the Past (1973), Rust Never Sleeps (1979), Human Highway (1982), Greendale (2003), and CSNY/D\u00E9j\u00E0 Vu (2008). He has also contributed to the soundtracks of films including Philadelphia (1993) and Dead Man (1995). Young is an environmentalist and outspoken advocate for the welfare of small farmers, having co-founded in 1985 the benefit concert Farm Aid. He is currently working on a documentary about electric car technology, tentatively titled LincVolt. The project involves his 1959 Lincoln Continental converted to hybrid technology as an environmentalist statement. In 1986, Young helped found The Bridge School, an educational organization for children with severe verbal and physical disabilities, and its annual supporting Bridge School Benefit concerts, together with his ex-wife Pegi Young (n\u00E9e Morton). Young has three children: sons Zeke (born during his relationship with actress Carrie Snodgress) and Ben, who were diagnosed with cerebral palsy, and daughter Amber Jean who, like Young, has epilepsy. Young lives on his ranch near La Honda, California. Although he has lived in northern California since the 1970s and sings as frequently about US themes and subjects as he does about his native country, he has retained his Canadian citizenship. On July 14, 2006, Young was awarded the Order of Manitoba, and on December 30, 2009, was made an Officer of the Order of Canada."@en ;

He is best known as the frontman of Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds, established in 1983, a group known for its diverse output and ever-evolving line-up. Prior to this, he fronted the Birthday Party, one of the most extreme and confrontational post-punk bands of the early 1980s. In 2006, he formed the garage rock band Grinderman, releasing its debut album the following year. Referred to as rock music's \"Prince of Darkness\", Cave's music is generally characterised by emotional intensity, a wide variety of influences, and lyrical obsessions with death, religion, love and violence. NME described him as \"the grand lord of gothic lushness\". Cave has also worked as a composer for films, often in collaboration with fellow Australian musician Warren Ellis. Their films together include The Proposition (2005, based on a screenplay by Cave), The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford (2007), The Road (2009) and Lawless (2012). Cave is the subject and co-writer of the semi-fictional \"day in the life\" documentary 20,000 Days on Earth (2014). Upon Cave's induction into the ARIA Hall of Fame, ARIA Awards committee chairman Ed St John said: \"Nick Cave has enjoyed\u2014and continues to enjoy\u2014one of the most extraordinary careers in the annals of popular music.

Called the Queen of Tejano music, her contributions to music and fashion made her one of the most celebrated Mexican-American entertainers of the late 20th century. Billboard magazine named her the \"top Latin artist of the '90s\", the \"best selling Latin artist of the decade\". She was called the \"Tejano Madonna\" for her clothing choices, by media outlets. She also ranks among the most influential Latin artists of all-time and is credited for catapulting a music genre into mainstream. The youngest child of the Quintanilla family, she debuted on the music scene in 1980 as a member of the band Selena y Los Dinos, which also included her elder siblings A.B. Quintanilla and Suzette Quintanilla. Selena began recording professionally in 1982. In the 1980s, she was often criticized and was refused bookings at venues across Texas for performing Tejano music\u2014a male-dominated music genre. However, her popularity grew after she won the Tejano Music Award for Female Vocalist of the Year in 1986, which she won nine consecutive times. Selena signed with EMI Latin in 1989 and released her self-titled debut album the same year, while her brother became her principal music producer and songwriter. Selena released Entre a Mi Mundo (1992), which peaked at number one on the U.S. Billboard Regional Mexican Albums chart for 19 nonconsecutive weeks. The album's commercial success led music critics to call the album the \"breakthrough\" recording of her musical career. One of its singles, \"Como La Flor\", became one of her most popular signature songs. Live! (1993) won Best Mexican/American Album at the 1994 Grammy Awards, becoming the first recording by a Tejano artist to do so. In 1994, Selena released Amor Prohibido, which became one of the best-selling Latin albums in the United States. It was critically acclaimed as being responsible for Tejano music's first marketable era as it became one of the most popular Latin music subgenres at the time. Selena began recording English-language songs for her crossover album. Aside from music, Selena was active in her community and donated her time to civic causes. Coca-Cola appointed her its spokesperson in Texas. Selena became a sex icon; she was often criticized for wearing suggestive outfits in light of her comments about being a role model for young women. Selena and her guitarist, Chris P\u00E9rez, eloped in April 1992 after her father raised concerns over their relationship. On March 31, 1995, Selena was shot dead by Yolanda Sald\u00EDvar, her friend and former employee of her Selena Etc. boutiques. Two weeks after her death, George W. Bush\u2014governor of Texas at the time\u2014declared her birthday Selena Day in Texas. Her posthumous crossover album, Dreaming of You (1995), debuted atop the Billboard 200, making Selena the first Latin artist to accomplish this feat.

Taylor is also a member of the roots and alternative music group, Lost Dogs. He is currently based in San Jose, California, U.S. Taylor is highly regarded for his songwriting skills. These often include allusions to and reworkings of material ranging from Elizabethan poets to modern authors. Foremost among Taylor's influences is William Blake. The Daniel Amos album title Fearful Symmetry was drawn from Blake's poem \"The Tyger,\" and numerous songs across The Alarma! Chronicles series of albums have Blake-inspired references. Some other poets who have influenced Taylor's work are T. S. Eliot and Christina Rossetti. Eliot's poetry inspired the song \"Hollow Man\" from the Doppelg\u00E4nger album. \"Where Dreams Come True\" from Taylor's solo LP A Briefing for the Ascent draws heavily from Rosetti's poem \"Echo.\" The inspiration for many Daniel Amos and Taylor songs from the mid-1980s can be found in the book Behold, This Dreamer: Of Reverie, Night, Sleep, Dream, Love-Dreams, Nightmare, Death. This book, compiled by Walter de la Mare and published in 1939, contains poems and essays that appear in Taylor's songwriting. De la Mare is thanked in the liner notes of the final installment of The Alarma! Chronicles, Fearful Symmetry. References to contemporary authors also appear in Taylor's songs. One example is the song \"Shape of Air\" from the LP Darn Floor-Big Bite. The song explores the mystical musings of Annie Dillard found in her Pulitzer prize-winning book, Pilgrim at Tinker Creek. The album is also heavily inspired by the works of Czes\u0142aw Mi\u0142osz. This is especially evident in songs like \"The Unattainable Earth\" (which was named after one of Mi\u0142osz' books), \"Safety Net\", \"Pictures of the Gone World\", \"Divine Instant\", and \"Half Light, Epoch, and Phase\". On Taylor's 1998 release, John Wayne he credits more influences; Flannery O'Connor, Dennis Prager and Frederick Buechner. During the 1990s and into the new millennium, Taylor's songwriting for the Lost Dogs and on other projects turned away from more esoteric themes. The songs crafted during this phase of Taylor's career marked a shift toward \"Americana\" and, in some ways, a return to the country music sound of Daniel Amos in the early 1970s. The primary vehicle for this phase of Taylor's songwriting career is the Lost Dogs, with a number of noteworthy solo projects. The Lost Dogs began in 1991 as a one-time collaboration between vocalists and songwriters from four different bands at the behest of their label at that time. Taylor, Gene Eugene (of Adam Again), Derri Daugherty (of The Choir), and Michael Roe (of The 77s) have released several eclectic albums of traditional American music (country, folk, blues, rock) over the last decade."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Thelonious Sphere Monk (October 10, 1917 \u2013 February 17, 1982) was an American jazz pianist and composer. Monk had a unique improvisational style and made numerous contributions to the standard jazz repertoire, including \"'Round Midnight\", \"Blue Monk\", \"Straight, No Chaser\" \"Ruby, My Dear\", \"In Walked Bud\", and \"Well, You Needn't\". Monk is the second-most recorded jazz composer after Duke Ellington, which is particularly remarkable as Ellington composed more than 1,000 pieces, whereas Monk wrote about 70. His compositions and improvisations feature dissonances and angular melodic twists, and are consistent with Monk's unorthodox approach to the piano, which combined a highly percussive attack with abrupt, dramatic use of silences and hesitations. He was renowned for his distinctive style in suits, hats, and sunglasses. He was also noted for an idiosyncratic habit observed at times during performances: while the other musicians in the band continued playing, he would stop, stand up from the keyboard, and dance for a few moments before returning to the piano. Monk is one of five jazz musicians to have been featured on the cover of Time, after Louis Armstrong, Dave Brubeck, and Duke Ellington, and before Wynton Marsalis."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Tina Turner (born November 26, 1939), n\u00E9e Anna Mae Bullock, is a singer, dancer, actress, and author, whose career has spanned more than half a century, earning her widespread recognition and numerous awards. Born and raised in the Southeastern United States, she is now a Swiss citizen. She began her musical career in the mid-1950s as a featured singer with Ike Turner's Kings of Rhythm, first recording in 1958 under the name \"Little Ann.\" Her introduction to the public as Tina Turner began in 1960 as a member of the Ike & Tina Turner Revue. Success followed with a string of notable hits credited to the duo, including \"A Fool in Love\", \"River Deep \u2013 Mountain High\" (1966), \"Proud Mary\" (1971) and \"Nutbush City Limits\" (1973), a song which she herself wrote. In her autobiography, I, Tina, she revealed several instances of severe domestic abuse against her by Ike Turner prior to their 1976 split and subsequent 1978 divorce. Raised as a Baptist, she melded her faith with Nichiren Buddhism in 1971, crediting the spiritual chant of Nam Myoho Renge Kyo in the Soka Gakkai tradition for helping her to endure during difficult times. After her divorce from Ike Turner, she rebuilt her career through live performances. In the early 1980s, she launched a major comeback with another string of hits, starting in 1983 with the single \"Let's Stay Together\" followed by the 1984 release of her fifth solo album Private Dancer which became a worldwide success. \"What's Love Got to Do with It\", the lead single won three Grammy Awards including Record of the Year. Her solo success continued with the multi platinum albums Break Every Rule and Foreign Affair and with singles such as \"We Don't Need Another Hero (Thunderdome)\", \"The Best\" and \"GoldenEye\" for the James Bond film of the same name. \"What's Love Got to Do with It\" was later used as the title of a loosely based biographical film adapted from her autobiography. In addition to her musical career, Turner has also experienced success in films, including the role of Acid Queen in the 1975 rock musical Tommy, a starring role alongside Mel Gibson in the 1985 action film Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome, and a cameo role in the 1993 film Last Action Hero. One of the world's best-selling music artists of all time, she has also been referred to as The Queen of Rock 'n' Roll. Turner has been termed the most successful female Rock 'n' Roll artist, receiving eleven Grammy Awards, including eight competitive awards and three Grammy Hall of Fame awards. Turner has also sold more concert tickets than any other solo performer in history. Her combined album and single sales total approximately 180 million copies worldwide, making her one of the biggest selling females in music history. She is noted for her energetic stage presence, powerful vocals, and career longevity. In 2008, Turner returned from semi-retirement to embark on her Tina!: 50th Anniversary Tour. Turner's tour became one of the highest selling ticketed shows of 2008\u201309. Rolling Stone ranked her no. 63 on their 100 greatest artists of all time. In 1991, she was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame."@en ;

A distinguished theatre director, he developed Chilean theatre by directing a broad array of works, ranging from locally produced Chilean plays, to the classics of the world stage, to the experimental work of such playwrights as Ann Jellicoe. He also played a pivotal role among neo-folkloric musicians who established the Nueva Canci\u00F3n Chilena (New Chilean Song) movement; this led to an uprising of new sounds in popular music during the administration of Salvador Allende. Shortly after the Chilean coup of 11 September 1973, Jara was arrested; he was tortured under interrogation and ultimately shot dead. His body was later thrown out into the street of a shanty town in Santiago. The contrast between the themes of his songs, on love, peace and social justice and the brutal way in which he was murdered transformed Jara into a \"potent symbol of struggle for human rights and justice\" for those killed during the Pinochet regime."@en ;

Her style was partially inspired by American singers of the 1950s. Simultaneously, it was in the spirit of the modal jazz scene going down in Europe in the 1960s. Mostly, Carola's jazz repertoire consisted in idiosyncratic versions of American songs in English, while her most famous jazz track \"The Flame\" was an original composition by Esa Pethman and the lyrics by the singer herself. As the vocalist for Esa Pethman's quartet and Hazy Osterwald's sextet in the early 1960s, Carola made fame in Finland and Sweden, and toured Poland, Czechoslovakia, and Switzerland. Her most significant recording is a session with the Heikki Sarmanto Trio from 1966, which the Finnish Music Information Centre considers among the original blueprints of Finnish jazz. Carola's recordings have been credited for the accosting tone of her contralto voice and her phrasing. The singer also co-produced the groovy approach of her supporting orchestras. In late 1960s and early 1970s, she performed in nine languages and a wide variety of styles, including chanson, schlager, Latin, rock'n'roll, and soul. After her death of Alzheimer's disease in 1997, Carola's music was revived in 2004 with two Best of albums and Carola & Heikki Sarmanto Trio reaching the Finnish charts."@en ;

He comes from a family of musicians in Jaipur. His father, the late Shashi Mohan Bhatt, a sitarist of great repute and a professor at the University of Rajasthan, Jaipur trained many musicians in the family including Krishna Bhatt, Manju Mehta in Ahmedabad and Vishwa Mohan Bhatt. Krishna Bhatt\u2019s forefathers migrated from the south of India (Andhra Pradesh) to the state of Rajasthan in the northwest, a princely state then, to seek employment in the \u201CGunijankh\u0101n\u0101\u201D (department of learned scholars) of the Maharaja of Jaipur. They were Sanskrit scholars, poets, and musicians. In his teens, Krishna\u2019s musical grooming was further enhanced by many years of study under the tutelage of his Guru Pt. Ravi Shankar, and musicians Pt. Nikhil Banerjee and Ustad Ali Akbar Khan, who had a strong impact on Krishna's musical growth. While developing his own individual style, Krishna\u2019s music was greatly influenced by twentieth century stalwarts such as the vocalists Amir Khan, Bade Gulam Ali Khan, Abdul Karim Khan, Begum Akhtar, Shobha Gurtu as well as folk singers of Rajasthan. Krishna\u2019s repertoire in performance includes a wide variety of rare and old traditional compositions from these masters of music. Krishna Bhatt has received numerous awards and honors including the Sangeet Kalaratna (Jewel of Music) in 2009. He was also presented the \u201CGunijan\u201D award by the President of India Mrs. Pratibha Patil in 2005 and was conferred the \u201CKalashiroman\u201D samman by the Maharaja of Jodhpur Shri Gajsinghji and Shri John Singhji of Jaipur Virasat Foundation in 2007 in Rajasthan, India. Krishna Bhatt has been twice the recipient of the AIIS fellowship awards in 1998 and 2004 in the category of performing arts. In addition to performing Hindustani classical music, Bhatt has also performed and recorded with the American composer Terry Riley (working on the score for the Alain Tanner film No Man's Land), Zakir Hussain, the Kronos Quartet, Jody Stecher, jazz saxophonist George Brooks, and Rajasthani folk musicians.

Ruth had organized the Selah Jubilee Singers, a gospel group drawn from the membership of a church choir, leaving it in 1949 to pursue more secular interests in music. Ruth was a deejay on WOV, a radio station in New York, at a time in the late 1940s when gospel groups such as Sister Rosetta Tharpe, the Pilgrim Travelers and the Five Blind Boys were touring the country playing in shabby settings with few amenities for the performers. Meanwhile, rhythm and blues groups were becoming so popular that theaters such as the Apollo Theater began featuring highly successful R&B revues. Gospel groups were popular on radio stations but their performances made no money. No one had yet conceived of combining the power of gospel with the highly charged, money-making revue format of the successful R&B acts that appealed to urban audiences. In 1955, Ruth succeeded in signing a gospel group to play in a commercial theater for the first time in the history of American entertainment. Subsequently Ruth continued to feature gospel groups as a prominent and influential deejay and promoter."@en ;

At the age of five she and her family fled the civil war in Afghanistan to settle in Canada. Raised in Vancouver, BC, Mozhdah studied Broadcast Journalism at the British Columbia Institute of Technology, and Philosophy and Political Science at the University of British Columbia. She also wrote songs. Among these songs was Dokhtare Afghan (Afghan Girl). Dokhtare Afghan was an instant hit on the Afghan TV stations and airwaves. It brought back the stories of strong Afghan heroines to the homes of many of the Afghans and sparked an interest amongst young Afghan women. It also earned Mozhdah many nominations and awards at the Afghan and International TV and radio stations. Dokhtare Afghan also brought history to Afghan Culture. On International Women\u2019s Day 2010, Mozhdah was asked to be the first Afghan to perform at the White House for President and Mrs. Obama, and the song she sang was of the bravery of Afghan Women \u201CDokhtare Afghan\u201D. In December 2009 she was offered a position to work with an up-and-coming television station in Afghanistan, 1TV. She was to be the host of Afghanistan\u2019s Got Talent. Mozhdah took the offer because it meant that she could go back to her homeland. Mozhdah's political and philosophical studies also gave her the drive to pursue more difficult ambitions. Once she joined 1TV, she soon decided she wanted to make her trip to Afghanistan fulfill her desire to make a difference. The concept of the Mozhdah show was created. On the Mozhdah Show, Mozhdah and her producers created programming that addressed hard hitting and taboo topics in Afghan society, and what it was like to be a woman, a child, a person living in Afghan society. The Mozhdah Show also provided Mozhdah with the ability to explore and learn more about the current situation in Afghanistan through the eyes of Afghans."@en ;

Hayes was the frontman and singer of the pop duo Savage Garden, whose 1997 album Savage Garden peaked at No. 1 in Australia, No. 2 in United Kingdom and No. 3 in United States. It spawned the singles \"I Want You\", \"To the Moon and Back\", and Australian and US No. 1 \"Truly Madly Deeply\". The duo followed the success of their debut album with Affirmation (1999), which provided additional hits such as US No. 1 \"I Knew I Loved You\", and Australian No. 3 \"The Animal Song\". Savage Garden sold more than 23 million albums worldwide before parting ways in 2001. Hayes released his first solo album Spin in 2002. The album sold two million copies worldwide, debuted at No. 2 in the UK and No. 3 in Australia. It delivered the hit single \"Insatiable\". Hayes's second solo album The Tension and the Spark marked a change of direction for the singer-songwriter, showing experimentation with electronica and darker lyrics. NME wrote about its first single, \"Pop!ular\" saying it was \"A twistered masterclass in career reintervention...This guy is a genius.\" While The Observer said \"This album is no folly and succeeds, often to the point of all out triumph, on its own terms.\" Hayes parted way with his record label Columbia Records in 2006 and started his own independent record label, Powdered Sugar, from which he would release his third solo album, This Delicate Thing We've Made (2007). In mid-2010, Hayes announced the completion of recording his fourth solo album, Secret Codes and Battleships, featuring three songs co-written and produced by Brian West and mixed by Robert Orton, who is best known for working with Lady Gaga. On 17 April 2011, Hayes signed with Mercury Records' Australian division and in August 2011 with EMI Records in the UK. The album was released in Australia on 21 October 2011, 24 October in the UK and 25 October in the US, with singles \"Talk Talk Talk\", \"Bloodstained Heart\", and \"Black Out the Sun\" released before the album. On January 11, 2016, The band, Midnight Green, released a version of the Darren Hayes demo - The Sweetest Lullaby. In 2013, Hayes relocated from London to Los Angeles, where he began to pursue a career in improv sketch comedy and acting.

In performances, publications and installations, Hecker deals with specific compositional developments of post-war modernity, electro-acoustic music as well as other, non-musical disciplines.

Their objectual autonomy is exposed while simultaneously evoking sensations, memories and associations in an immersive intensity.

Frost has previously performed with Gorgoroth, Zyklon-B, Gehenna and Keep Of Kalessin. He originally joined Satyricon temporarily to record the demo \"The Forest is My Throne\", later joining the band full-time. He currently studies at a mathematics college in Oslo. Frost employs various drumming styles when performing with different bands. With early 1349 and early Satyricon he extensively uses blast beats. His recent work with Satyricon is more simplistic and mid-tempo, as is his work on \"Revelations of the Black Flame\", 1349's fourth album. On 1349's fifth album \"Demonoir\", and sixth album Massive Cauldron of Chaos however, Frost once again makes extensive use of blastbeats. He is generally regarded as one of the most proficient and fastest drummers in the black metal scene. On all Satyricon albums his role is credited simply as \"battery\". Frost was denied entry to North America by the US Department of Homeland Security upon failing to note having been sentenced to 5 months for assault (during a bar fight in the early '90s) when applying for his work visa. On 1349 tours before 2008, he was replaced by Tony Laureano. Joey Jordison and Trym Torson have performed with Satyricon on North American tour dates. He later was able to perform again in the United States.

A native of Chicago, Al Trace played professional baseball before deciding on music as a career. His first jobs during the early 1920s included playing the drums and singing with various bands, until he formed his own band in 1933, the year his home city was celebrating its centennial with a World's Fair officially known as A Century of Progress International Exposition. The band's premiere engagement in May 1933 was at the Fair's French pavilion and, when the Fair closed for the winter on November, he remained in Chicago, beginning a long engagement at the Blackhawk Restaurant, followed by three years at the Sherman Hotel. Starting in early 1943 and continuing during and after World War II, the Al Trace Orchestra, including vocalists Toni Arden and Bob Vincent, were familiar regulars on Chicago-based It Pays to Be Ignorant, one of the most popular shows of the era referenced as the Golden Age of Radio. Trace recorded for several record companies: Mercury Records, MGM Records, Columbia Records, Damon Records, Regent Records and composed over 300 songs, some alone and others as a collaborator, most frequently with his ten-years-older brother, Ben, while also writing a considerable number of songs using the pseudonyms Clem Watts or Bob Hart. Among the Ben Trace/Al Trace collaborations was Al's most successful recording, \"You Call Everybody Darlin'\", which became a #1 hit in 1948. Another very popular song was \"If I Knew You Were Comin' I'd've Baked a Cake\". His other song collaborators included Al Hoffman, Bob Merrill, and Abner Silver. In 1975, shortly after his seventy-fourth birthday, he retired from active work as a songwriter and bandleader and joined with another ex-bandleader to form a booking agency in Scottsdale, Arizona. Al Trace died of a stroke in Sun City West, Arizona at the age of 92."@en ;

She found fame in the all-female R&B/garage trio Mis-Teeq. The trio disbanded in 2005 and Dixon pursued a music career as a solo artist, signing to Polydor Records. She began recording her debut solo album, Fired Up, in 2006, but due to poor record sales of her first two singles, \"Lipstick\" and \"Knockdown\", she was dropped from Polydor. In 2007, Dixon won Strictly Come Dancing. Her television exposure led to a successful comeback, which included her signing to Asylum Records, an offshoot of Warner Music Group. Dixon then released a second album, entitled The Alesha Show, in 2008, which received platinum certification from BPI in the UK and spawned four singles including \"The Boy Does Nothing\" and \"Breathe Slow\", the latter of which became her highest charting single and earned her a Brit Award nomination. In September 2009, Dixon became a judge on the seventh series of Strictly Come Dancing, replacing Arlene Phillips. The replacement of Phillips by Dixon attracted criticism, as some questioned the extent of Dixon's dancing knowledge. In 2010, Dixon returned for the eighth series of Strictly Come Dancing and released her third studio album, The Entertainer.

	dbo:abstract	"Antti Yrj\u00F6 Hammarberg (14 September 1943 \u2013 14 January 1991), professionally known as Irwin Goodman, was a popular Finnish rock and folk singer. In the late 1960s he was widely known as a protest singer. He recorded over 300 songs, most of which were his own compositions, with lyrics written by Vexi Salmi. Irwin Goodman started as a protest song singer in the folk boom of the mid-1960s, his humorous songs, often mocking the authorities, became favorites of the Finnish people; to such an extent that small \"Irwin singalike\" contests are continuously arranged by some pubs for entertainment. Goodman had continuing troubles with Finnish tax authorities and had ever-worsening problems with alcohol. His escapades were eagerly followed by sensationalist magazines such as Hymy. Goodman died of a heart attack while on the way from Vyborg to Hamina, Finland. The story of his life was turned into a feature film, Rentun Ruusu, in 2001. Irwin's most famous songs include \"Poing Poing Poing\" (1971), \"Haistakaa Paska Koko Valtiovalta\" (1976), \"Rentun Ruusu\" (1988), \"Ei Tippa Tapa\" (1966), \"Ty\u00F6miehen lauantai\" (1965), \"En Kerro Kuinka Jouduin Naimisiin\" (1965) and \"Tytt\u00F6 Tuli\" (1978). He won the Syksyn S\u00E4vel song contest twice. Common themes on his songs were poverty, taxes, drinking and alcoholism (\"Ei tippa tapa\", \"Viel\u00E4 yhdet\", \"Kieltolaki\", \"Homma k\u00E4y\", \"Ty\u00F6miehen lauantai\", \"Rentun ruusu\") and problems with money (\"Raha ratkaisee\", \"Kun ei rahat riit\u00E4\", \"Meni rahahommat pieleen\", \"Manu vippaa muutama markka\"). He protested the government with songs like \"Juhlavalssi,\" and \"Haistakaa paska koko valtiovalta\". In 1971, Irwin released an album featuring actor Esa Pakarinen. His 1972 album Kohta taas on joulu consists of Christmas carols. The later songs (\"Suruton nuoruusaika\", \"Maailma on kaunis\", \"Ai, ai, ai, kun nuori ois\" and \"Viimeinen laulu\") were often dark when compared to songs from the 1960s and 1970s."@en ;

O'Donnell collaborated with his musical colleague Michael Salvatori for many of the scores; he has also directed voice talent and sound design for the Halo trilogy. O'Donnell was Bungie's audio lead until April 11, 2014. O'Donnell began his music career writing television and radio jingles as well as scoring for radio and film. O'Donnell moved to composing video game music when his company, TotalAudio, did the sound design for the 1997 title Riven. After producing the music for Myth II, Bungie contracted O'Donnell to work on their other projects, including Oni and the project that would become Halo: Combat Evolved. O'Donnell ended up joining the Bungie staff only ten days before the studio was bought by Microsoft, and would be the audio director for all Bungie projects until he was fired. O'Donnell's score to the Halo trilogy has been called iconic, earning him several awards, and the commercial soundtrack release of the music to Halo 2 was the best-selling video game soundtrack of all time in the United States. He then went on to compose the scores to Halo 3 and Halo: Reach, released on September 25, 2007, and September 14, 2010, respectively.

She is considered to be the most famous person in the Israeli entertainment business (a title she's held for almost a decade now), and was labeled \"one of the hottest new artists to break into the United States.\" Ninet has released four successful albums in Israel (one of them in English), and has twice won Israel's Favorite Act at the MTV Europe Music Awards. She has also worked with producer Mike Crossey (who produced her third album, Sympathetic Nervous System), and artists such as Steven Wilson (Ninet performs on his solo albums, Hand. Cannot. Erase. and 4 \u00BD), Gary Lucas, Cyndi Lauper, The Jesus and Mary Chain, and The Dead Daisies. Alongside her musical career, Ninet enjoyed a successful acting career, performing both in movies and the theatre. She currently lives in Tel Aviv and is married to music producer and guitarist Yossi Mizrachi. After achieving almost everything that her local scene can offer, Ninet has set her sights on the international stage, looking to impact her music to larger audiences worldwide. Nowadays, with multiple projects under her belt, she is \"poised to have a major breakthrough in the U.S with her American debut album coming out the latter part of 2016.\" Ninet is expected to begin her first high-profile international tour in the U.S, Canada (Toronto & Montreal), and Europe, at early 2016. The tour will feature songs from her upcoming release. It will be her 5th album, and the first to be released and promoted in the U.S. As part of her tour, Ninet has already been selected to perform at SXSW in March. She is also planned to tour as a featured guest vocalist on Steven Wilson's tour, whom after their successful collaborations in the past, invited her to join him for several performances. The upcoming 2016 tour is the result of Ninet's recent and short visit to the U.S in 2015, which created an intensive buzz and high demand for this \"infectious female artist\". During her time in the U.S, Ninet performed several concerts in New York City, which were praised by the critics. One of them, who attended one of her shows, proudly stated that \"having seen Ninet perform \u2026 it\u2019s safe to say that the entire audience was fixated and almost hypnotized by her presence.\" Others claimed that \"her bold renditions of songs like 'Crazy' and her original releases have showcased the range in which she approaches music and thus identifies with at least some part of all of us.\" In preparation for her upcoming tour, Ninet released two new singles from her forthcoming album \u2013 \"Paper Parachute\" and \"Child\". The two \"promise an album worth waiting for\", and were ultimately declared as ones in which Ninet's \"haunting vocals are backed by clever production work and energy fulfilling beats\"."@en ;

During the 1950s, she started singing professionally, eventually abandoning her career as an actress in the 1960s. Since then, she has recorded more than 35 discs. As a singer, she has specialized in traditional Spanish and Latin American music: bolero, copla (music), ballad, ronda, vals, and folk music (Peruvian, Argentinian, Mexican, and Venezuelan). Her contralto voice has a deep resonance and sure melodic footing which must stem from classical training. Her pronunciation is pure Castilian, and her music pure Latin American. Her repertoire encompasses some of the most memorable melodies from Mexico, Peru, Venezuela and Chile and her interpretations close to genuine. She typically sings accompanied by guitars, requintos, and drums.

He presented a show on BBC Radio 1 which focused on promoting new left field music. Examples of artists featured on his show include Tipper, Moloko and a host of unsigned acts. Until September 2006, he and Chris Coco were the presenters of the Blue Room on Radio 1. The show had a dedicated following, and was one of the few showcases for a unique blend of quirky chillout tunes. He also hosted Radio 1's One Music show on Thursday nights, the content of which was more similar to the music played on his current show. Rob da Bank filled in for John Peel's show for several weeks following his death in 2004. In 2009 he gave BBC Blast an exclusive look behind the scenes of his show. Until 2014, he hosted a Friday-night/Saturday-morning BBC Radio 1 show focused on left-field electronics. He is also the owner of a number of business ventures under the name Sunday Best, which originated as a Sunday night event in a Battersea tea-room. The music played by Rob da Bank on Sunday Best helped launch the \"bar culture\" (as opposed to \"club culture\"), which features more relaxed activities than dancing.Sunday Best has grown to incorporate a record label and two offshoot music festivals, Bestival on the Isle of Wight and in 2008, Camp Bestival, which is more family orientated and held in the grounds of Lulworth Castle in Dorset. Gorham has also compiled a mix LP for the Fabric night club's series of mix compilations, entitled Fabric 24 (2006). In June 2014, it was announced that in September 2014, Rob da Bank would leave BBC Radio 1 and that he would join the 6 Music family. His last show was on Saturday 30 August 2014.

He graduated Class of 1968 from Chaminade High School, then attending Manhattan College, where he was initiated as a member of Phi Mu Alpha Sinfonia music fraternity in 1969. He was interested in motorcycles, and was working as a toll collector at the Brooklyn-Battery Tunnel when he responded to an advertisement by composer Jacques Morali seeking \"macho\" singers and dancers. Hughes and other members of the band were given a crash course in the synchronized dance choreography that later typified the group's live performances. Glenn's powerful bass voice played an important part in the background lyrics of almost all Village People's most known hits, such as \"In the Navy\". He sported an extravagant horseshoe moustache and wore his trademark leather outfit on stage and off. As he was the band's \"biker\" and a real life fanatic, he kept his motorcycle parked inside his home. With Village People gaining fame, Hughes became one of the icons of the disco era, even appearing in a special television broadcast in Playboy Mansion with Hugh Hefner. In 1996, he retired from dancing and launched his own successful New York cabaret act, which kept him busy until he was diagnosed with lung cancer (He had been a regular smoker since he was a teenager.). He was replaced by Eric Anzalone as the Biker character. However, Hughes continued with management of the band. During his later years, he was known for storming the streets of New York with his Custom Harley-Davidson motorcycle. Hughes, who was also referred to by the masses as \"Leatherman\", was named on People Magazine's 1979 list of most beautiful people. Hughes died in March 2001, aged 50, at his Manhattan apartment from lung cancer.

His solo debut came in 1976 with the album Umareta Tokoro o T\u014Dku Hanarete. Though his exposure in the media has always been extremely low, relative to many performers with similar levels of mainstream popularity, he has acquired his many fans over the years through his steady series of live performances. Many of his early songs expressed his skepticism about how one should live their life. In addition to his well-known ballads, he was strongly influenced by his father's experience as a victim of radiation poisoning following the atomic bombing of Hiroshima in 1945, and many of his songs have a very strong protest song tone, likely the most of any \"big name\" singer in Japan.

In Immortal, he is known for his lyrics which, unconventionally for black metal, focus on icy landscapes and a fictional land called Blashyrkh. The story of Blashyrkh is gradually told throughout Immortal's albums. When writing lyrics he often takes long walks in the Norwegian countryside near his hometown of Bergen for inspiration. He was known for his simplistic but extremely fast guitar parts which always featured power chords. He and frontman Abbath comprised the core of Immortal in its early years, with other members fluctuating and little stability until drummer Horgh joined the band in 1997. Demonaz played guitar on the albums Diabolical Fullmoon Mysticism, Pure Holocaust and Battles in the North, with his last musical contribution to Immortal being the 1997 album Blizzard Beasts. That same year, he was diagnosed with acute tendinopathy and could no longer play guitar at the speed required for Immortal. Instead, he continues to write lyrics for the band and often takes the role of manager. He often accompanies the band on tour and is still seen by Abbath, Horgh and Apollyon as a member of the band even though it is unlikely he will ever be able to play guitar as part of the band.[citation needed] Demonaz has appeared in all of Immortal's music videos, including the music video for All Shall Fall, which was released in September 2010. Demonaz has started a band called Demonaz where he is the vocalist. The band also includes most of the members of the band I. He wrote the lyrics for the I album Between Two Worlds.

He is one of Mayhem's founding members, along with Euronymous, Manheim and Messiah. He's the only original member to remain in the band, as Messiah and Manheim left Mayhem, respectively, in 1986 and 1988, and Euronymous was murdered in 1993. He was in the band since 1984, but left in 1991 due to personal concerns over media and police attention following the suicide of former vocalist Dead as well as internal conflicts and disagreement with bandmate Euronymous. He was replaced by Varg Vikernes as a session bassist. In 1993, Vikernes was arrested and sentenced to serve 21 years for murdering Euronymous. In 1995 Stubberud reunited the band, along with Hellhammer, Maniac and new guitarist Blasphemer, replacing the deceased Euronymous, and still plays in Mayhem; however, according to Mayhem guitarist Blasphemer, he did not play bass on their album Ordo Ad Chao. He has also played in other bands: L.E.G.O., Kvikks\u00F8lvguttene, Bloodthorn (guest artist) and Checker Patrol.

Born in Ridgecrest, California, Hoppus spent his childhood moving back and forth between his mother and father's houses, as they divorced when he was in third grade. He became interested in skateboarding and punk rock in junior high, and received a bass guitar from his father at the age of fifteen. After moving to San Diego in 1992, Hoppus' sister introduced him to Tom DeLonge, and together with drummer Scott Raynor, they formed the band Blink-182. With DeLonge's termination from the band in 2015, Hoppus remains the only founding member. Blink-182 produced several rock recordings and toured exhaustively before signing to major label MCA to co-distribute their sophomore effort, 1997's Dude Ranch, which featured the Hoppus-penned hit \"Dammit\". After replacing Raynor with Travis Barker, the trio recorded Enema of the State (1999), which launched the band into multiplatinum success, becoming the biggest pop punk act of the era. Two more records followed\u2014the heavier Take Off Your Pants and Jacket (2001) and the more experimental Blink-182 (2003)\u2014before the band split in 2005 following internal tension.

LaBelle began her career in the early 1960s as lead singer and front woman of the vocal group, Patti LaBelle and the Bluebelles. Following the group's name change to Labelle in the early 1970s, she released the iconic disco song \"Lady Marmalade\" and the group later became the first African-American vocal group to land the cover of Rolling Stone magazine. After the group split in 1976, LaBelle began a successful solo career, starting with her critically acclaimed debut album, which included the career-defining song, \"You Are My Friend\". LaBelle became a mainstream solo star in 1984 following the success of the singles, \"If Only You Knew\", \"New Attitude\" and \"Stir It Up\", with the latter two crossing over to pop audiences becoming radio staples. Less than two years later, in 1986, LaBelle scored with the number-one album, Winner in You and the number-one duet single, \"On My Own\", with Michael McDonald. LaBelle eventually won a 1992 Grammy for Best Female R&B Vocal Performance for her 1991 album, Burnin', followed by a second Grammy win for the live album, Live! One Night Only. Her 1990s albums, Burnin', Gems (1994) and Flame (1997), continued her popularity with young R&B audiences throughout the decade. Following the release of two mildly receptive solo albums in the early new millennium, she reunited with her Labelle band mates for the album, Back to Now, followed by a briefly well received promotional tour. LaBelle's success has extended as an actress with a notable role in the film, A Soldier's Story, and in TV shows such as A Different World and American Horror Story: Freak Show. In 1992, LaBelle starred in her own TV sitcom, Out All Night. A decade later, LaBelle hosted her own lifestyle TV show, Living It Up with Patti LaBelle on TV One. In 2015, LaBelle took part in the dance competition, Dancing with the Stars. In a career that has spanned fifty years, she has sold more than fifty million records worldwide.

In 1915, Piron and Clarence Williams together started the Piron and Williams Publishing Company, and in their first year of business published Piron's composition, \u201CI Wish That I Could Shimmy Like My Sister Kate\u201D, which became his biggest hit. After touring briefly with W.C. Handy in 1917, he started an orchestra under his own name, which soon included such notables as Lorenzo Tio and Steve Lewis. Piron's New Orleans Orchestra quickly became the best paid African American band in New Orleans, for Piron landed regular jobs at both the Spanish Fort amusement park and the exclusive white New Orleans Country Club.[citation needed] In 1923, Piron took his band to New York City as part of his ambition to make the group nationally known. He succeeded in making a hit there, landing a residency at the Roseland Ballroom, and making recordings for three different companies, Okeh, Victor and Columbia. The influence of Piron's band on the New York scene can be heard in the records of other New York bands of that time, such as Fletcher Henderson's (although Piron's influence on New York music would be eclipsed a year later when Louis Armstrong arrived in the city). In early 1924, some of Piron's band members were finding the cold northern winter and unfamiliar food and culture objectionable. Piron put the matter to a vote and, to Piron's frustration, the majority of the band voted to return home. Back in New Orleans, he again lined up good jobs, returning to the Country Club, playing at Tranchina's Restaurant and on the excursion steamships Capital and President into the 1930s; in about 1935, he decided to dramatically change the sound of his orchestra to swing, in line with popular taste.[citation needed]"@en ;

Also an author, Shaw wrote both fiction and non-fiction. Widely regarded as \"one of jazz's finest clarinetists,\" Shaw led one of the United States' most popular big bands in the late 1930s through the early 1940s. Though he had numerous hit records, he was perhaps best known for his 1938 recording of Cole Porter's \"Begin the Beguine.\" Prior to the release of \"Beguine\" Shaw and his fledgling band had languished in relative obscurity for over two years and after its release, he became a major pop artist within short order. The record eventually became one of the era's defining recordings. Musically restless, Shaw was also an early proponent of what became known much later as Third Stream music, which blended elements of classical and jazz forms and traditions. His music influenced other musicians, such as John Barry in England with the vamp of the James Bond Theme possibly influenced by 'Nightmare' which also has a similar vamp to Kurt Weill's Lonely House. Shaw also recorded with small jazz groups drawn from within the ranks of the various big bands he led. He served in the US Navy from 1942 to 1944 (during which time he led a morale-building band that toured the South Pacific amidst the chaos of World War II), and following his discharge in 1944 he returned to lead a band through 1945. Following the break-up of that band he began to focus on other interests and gradually withdrew from the world of being a professional musician and major celebrity, although he remained a force in popular music and jazz before retiring from music altogether in 1954."@en ;

He was best known as the bassist and founding member of the progressive rock band Yes. He was the only member to appear on each of their 21 studio albums, released from 1969 to 2014. Born in the Kingsbury area of London, Squire took an early interest in church music and sang in the local church and school choirs. After he took up the bass guitar at age sixteen, his earliest gigs were in 1964 for The Selfs, which later evolved into The Syn. In 1968, Squire formed Yes with singer Jon Anderson; he would remain the band's sole bassist for the next 47 years. Squire was widely regarded as the dominant bassist among the English progressive rock bands, influencing peers and later generations of bassists with his incisive sound and elaborately contoured, melodic bass lines. His name was associated with his trademark instrument, the Rickenbacker 4001. In May 2015, Squire announced a hiatus from Yes after he was diagnosed with acute erythroid leukemia and subsequently died on 27 June at his home in Phoenix, Arizona. The band's first show of their tour with Toto on 7 August 2015 marked the first Yes concert ever performed without Squire. From 1991 to 2000, Rickenbacker produced a limited edition signature model bass in his name, the 4001CS. Squire released two solo albums, Fish Out of Water (1975) and Chris Squire's Swiss Choir (2007), a Christmas album."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Paul D'Amour (born May 12, 1967) is an American musician, and the first bass guitarist for Tool. His bass sound was recognized by the aggressive picked tone he developed with his Chris Squire Signature Rickenbacker 4001CS, which can clearly be heard on Tool's first full-length album, Undertow. D'Amour was born in Spokane, Washington. Originally a guitar player, D'Amour became Tool's bassist after being introduced to the band by guitarist Adam Jones. Like Jones, D'Amour was in Los Angeles because of his wish to enter the film industry. D'Amour left Tool in 1995. After his departure from the band, he formed the psychedelic pop band Lusk with Brad Laner, Chris Pitman, now of Guns N' Roses, and Greg Edwards of Failure and Autolux. In 1997, they released their only album, entitled Free Mars. Soon after his departure from Tool, D'Amour played guitar in a group named Replicants, a cover band that included Ken Andrews and Greg Edwards from Failure, as well as Chris Pitman. They released one self-titled album in 1995, with a guest appearance from former Tool band-mate, Maynard James Keenan. As of early 2005, D'Amour has been writing and performing under the name Feersum Ennjin. The name is inspired by the science fiction novel Feersum Endjinn by Iain Banks, an author whose novel The Wasp Factory was conceptual inspiration for Lusk as well. The project released a self-titled EP on Silent Uproar Records. In 2011, a self-titled LP was released on Dissociated Press, featuring some songs that had been released previously and some new ones. On the first track of the LP, \"The Fourth\", Tool drummer Danny Carey plays the drums. Currently, D'Amour plays bass in the band Lesser Key. The group consists of Andrew Zamudio (vocals), Brett Fanger (guitar), and Justin Hanson (drums). The band \"represents an exploration into personal and artistic freedom.\" On July 26, 2013, the band released a video of their debut single \"Intercession.\" Their debut EP was produced by Sylvia Massy and released on April 1, 2014 on Sumerian Records."@en ;

McTell is best known for his song \"Streets of London\", which has been covered by over two hundred artists around the world, and for his tale of Irish emigration, \"From Clare to Here\". In the 1980s he wrote and played songs for two TV children's programmes, Alphabet Zoo, which also featured Nerys Hughes, followed by Tickle on the Tum, featuring Jacqueline Reddin. Albums were also released from both series. He also recorded Keith Hopwood's and Malcolm Rowe's theme song to Cosgrove Hall's adaptation of The Wind in the Willows, and this was released as a single in 1984 after the series was aired on ITV. McTell's guitar playing has been modelled on the style of the US's country blues guitar players of the early 20th century, including Blind Blake, Robert Johnson and Blind Willie McTell. These influences led a friend to suggest that he change his professional name to McTell as his career was beginning to take shape. McTell is also an accomplished performer on piano and harmonica, which he uses on a harness."@en ;

Bonano was known for playing searing hot and technically virtuoso trumpet with a beautiful tone. His musical abilities were sometimes overlooked in part because of his love of being an entertainer; he would often sing silly lyrics in a high raspy voice and break into dance routines on stage. Bonano was born in the Milneburg neighborhood of New Orleans, Louisiana, by the shores of Lake Pontchartrain. He was a well regarded professional player by his mid teens, in his youth mostly playing in New Orleans other than a period with Eddie Edwards' band in New York City in 1920. Bonano then started traveling widely, seldom staying in one place or with one band for more than a few months. He briefly replaced Bix Beiderbecke in the Wolverines Orchestra, and Nick LaRocca in the Original Dixieland Jazz Band. Sharkey first recorded in New Orleans with Norman Brownlee's band in 1925, and soon after had a band under his own name. He returned to New York for work in Jimmie Durante's band, then with the Jean Goldkette Orchestra in 1927, returned to his home town to play with Leon Prima, to Los Angeles, California to work with Larry Shields. After time back in New Orleans played with the Ben Pollack Orchestra in 1936. After leaving Pollack's band he led his own band on 52nd Street in New York for three years. After World War II he toured Europe, Asia, and South America, played residencies in Chicago and New York, and then was a regular on Bourbon Street in the New Orleans French Quarter. In 1949, he appeared at the Roosevelt Hotel's Blue Room as well as the Famous Door Bar. According to one story, Arturo Toscanini heard Bonano in New York, then hired him to come to a rehearsal of the New York Philharmonic to play a couple of numbers unaccompanied for the orchestra to listen to. After Bonano did this, Toscanini berated his trumpet section at length about their inabilities to get tones out of their instruments like this jazz musician could. Bonano died in New Orleans."@en ;

As formulated by Dorsey, gospel music combines Christian praise with the rhythms of jazz and the blues. His conception also deviates from what had been, to that time, standard hymnal practice by referring explicitly to the self, and the self's relation to faith and God, rather than the individual subsumed into the group via belief. Dorsey, who was born in Villa Rica, Georgia, was the music director at Pilgrim Baptist Church in Chicago, Illinois from 1932 until the late 1970s. His best-known composition, \"Take My Hand, Precious Lord\", was performed by Mahalia Jackson and was a favorite of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.. Another composition, \"Peace in the Valley\", was a hit for Red Foley in 1951 and has been performed by dozens of other artists, including Queen of Gospel Albertina Walker, Elvis Presley and Johnny Cash. Dorsey died in Chicago, aged 93. In 2002, the Library of Congress honored his album Precious Lord: New Recordings of the Great Songs of Thomas A. Dorsey (1973), by adding it to the United States National Recording Registry."@en ;

Originating in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, Marmarosa became a professional musician in his mid-teens, and toured with several major big bands, including those led by Tommy Dorsey, Gene Krupa, and Artie Shaw into the mid-1940s. He moved to Los Angeles in 1945, where he became increasingly interested and involved in the emerging bebop scene. During his time on the West Coast, he recorded in small groups with leading bebop and swing musicians, including Howard McGhee, Charlie Parker, and Lester Young, as well as leading his own bands. Marmarosa returned to Pittsburgh due to health reasons in 1948. He began performing much less frequently, and had a presence only locally for around a decade. Friends and fellow musicians had commented from an early stage that Marmarosa was an unusual character. His mental stability was probably affected by being beaten into a coma when in his teens, by a short-lived marriage followed by permanent separation from his children, and by a traumatic period in the army. He made comeback recordings in the early 1960s, but soon retreated to Pittsburgh, where he played occasionally into the early 1970s. From then until his death three decades later, he lived with family and in veterans' hospitals."@en ;

He reached the height of his fame during the Rhodesian Bush War. Clem was born in Salisbury, Southern Rhodesia in 1948 and began writing songs while he was an art student in Durban, South Africa. One of his first songs, Vagabond Gun was a category winner in the South Africa Music Festival in 1966. Clem later moved back to Rhodesia to work in advertising. He started singing at Rhodesia's first folk venue, The Troubadour in Salisbury's Angwa Street. While performing there, he met Sue Eccles and Andy Dillon. The three formed a trio called The Kinfolk. The group moved to South Africa, and shortly after moving to Johannesburg, Sue left the group. Clem and Andy formed a new group with Yvonne Raff, which they called The Legend Trio. This new trio began singing at the original Southern African \"Troubadour\", and were also involved in a number of SAFMA's National Folk Fests. Clem married Jean Smith (daughter of Rhodesian prime minister Ian Smith) in 1967. Clem began a solo career, recording some singles with Art Heatlie at Trutone. Mel Miller, Peter Leroy and Sylvia Stott briefly joined Clem to form a group in 1970, before Clem moved back to Rhodesia in 1971. Clem moved back and soon built up a strong following. He did a series of Rhodesian Television shows, and presented a radio program called Folk on the Rocks, which was on the air for two seasons. The name came from the folk club Clem ran at The Beverley Rocks, where it played to regular packed houses. A popular star of the annual Bless 'Em All Troop Shows, and in great demand in the Rhodesian entertainment scene, Clem recorded his first album Songs of Love & War at Shed Studios. Clem wrote and produced the album himself. The album was awarded a Gold Disc. He wrote the soundtrack and songs for the C.I.S. film What A Time and the theme song for a film honouring the wounded troopies of Rhodesia, Tsanga, Tsanga. He appeared at the 7 Arts Theatre, Harare in the first half, supporting the American comedian Shelley Berman with members of the Shed Studios band \u2013 Comprising Martin Norris, Steve Roskilly, Bothwell Nyamhondera, Tony Logan and Steve Hughes. As artistic director of the advertising agency Matthewman Banks and Tholet, he was instrumental in writing a great many and memorable music jingles for his clients.

After living and working in the advertising industry for many years in Cape Town, Clem died on 6 October 2004 after having suffered from the effects of a debilitating illness for a number of years. Clem's last album, Archives was (and is) sold as a fund raiser to benefit the Flame Lily Foundation.

Best known in the late 1960s and early 1970s for his topical comedy songs performed on British television, his work ranged from satirical to bawdy to sentimental to pastoral, with a strong emphasis on storytelling, making him difficult to pigeonhole. Thackray sang in a lugubrious baritone voice, accompanying himself on a nylon-strung guitar in a style that was part classical, part jazz. His witty lyrics and clipped delivery, combined with his strong Yorkshire accent and the northern setting of many of his songs, led to him being described as the \"North Country No\u00EBl Coward\", a comparison Thackray resisted, although he acknowledged his lyrics were in the English tradition of Coward and Flanders and Swann, \"who are wordy, funny writers\". However, his tunes derived from the French chansonnier tradition: he claimed Georges Brassens as his greatest inspiration, and he was also influenced by Jacques Brel and Charles Trenet. He also admired Randy Newman. He was admired by, and influenced, many performers including Jarvis Cocker, Mike Harding, Momus, Ralph McTell, Morrissey, Alex Turner, and Jasper Carrott."@en ;

She performed with some of the most popular big bands of the 1940s, including those of Jimmy Dorsey and Harry James, before striking out on a solo career. She is widely known for her 1954 solo recording '\"Little Things Mean a Lot\" \u2014 a song that stayed at the U.S. number one spot for nine consecutive weeks, charted in the U.S. for almost seven months, hit #1 on the UK singles chart, and sold more than two million copies. AllMusic called the recording a \"monster hit\", and music historian Jonny Whiteside said the song \"ably characterizes Kallen\u2019s impressive, and graceful, transition from classic big band swing to modern post-war pop\". Voted \"most popular female singer\" in 1954 in both Billboard and Variety polls, Kallen lost her voice at the Palladium in 1955 at the top of her career and left singing for four years, suffering paralyzed vocal cords. After testing her voice under a pseudonym in small town venues, she ultimately returned and went on to achieve 13 top-ten career hits. Kallen performed at numerous prominent live venues including Manhattan's Copacabana, Morris Levy's Versailles, the Capitol Theater, the Maisonette Room at the St. Regis, the Cafe Rouge at the Hotel Pennsylvania and the Plaza Hotel's Persian Room. As well, she starred on Broadway in Finian's Rainbow; in the 1955 film The Second Greatest Sex and on numerous television shows including The Tonight Show with Johnny Carson, The Big Beat with singer-host Richard Hayes, American Bandstand, and Fred Allen's Judge for Yourself.

He is also known as one of the founders of Armenian rock.He was the founder and the lead singer of Apostles (1968 \u2013 1979), the first rock band performing songs in their native language in the history of the Soviet Union. He is the author of different architectural projects, including Guest House and the new building of Matenadaran in Armenia.[citation needed] Since childhood, Meschian has been interested in music and arts; singing songs in languages ranging from Hungarian to English. At the age of seven, he started taking violin and piano lessons at the school of music named after A. Spendiaryan. It was during those years when he made his first steps in writing songs and joined the boy\u2019s chorus at the National Academic Theater for Opera and Ballet. In 1973, he briefly joined the chorus of the Mother See of Holy Etchmiadzin. Even though his stay was short (less than a year) in the chorus, it had a profound influence on his subsequent musical creations. While still at school, Meschian wrote some of his early masterpieces including \u201CWhere were you, God?,\u201D \u201CThe Will,\u201D and \u201CThe Old Man.\u201D In 1965, he first performed his well acclaimed and widely controversial \u201CWhere were you, God?\u201D in the auditorium of number 122 secondary school where he was a student at the time. In 1966, he got accepted to the department of architecture at the National Polytechnic University of Armenia. In 1967, Meschian, along with his friends Levon Melikian and Gregory Nalbandian, founded a rock band which they initially did not give a name. The band was simply referred to as \u201CThe Band of the Department of Architecture.\u201D After giving a series of concerts throughout 1967 and on, the band gained an immense deal of acclaim among the youth. By blending Armenian spiritual music with the thriving rock of the time, the band left a remarkable impression on its listeners and became a true revelation. As a result, the activists at the Communist Committee raised concerns about the band\u2019s prolific endeavors. The committee led an anti-Meschian campaign accusing him of anti-Soviet propaganda and calling the band members \u201CNewly Ordained Apostles.\u201D It was, in much part, due to the name calling, that the band was later named \u201CThe apostles.\u201D The remarkable success of the Apostles was not hindered by anti-Meschian Communist efforts. In early 1970\u2019s, Meschian composed the first Armenian rock opera, \u201CThe Insane Asylum\u201D which vastly contributed to the band\u2019s publicity. Thereafter, the band started giving concerts in numerous universities and cities such as Gyumri, Moscow, Yerevan and Tallinn. In 1971, Meschian gave an outstanding performance in the USSR festival for young musicians in Poland, where the band was only allowed to participate under the guidance of the Communist Committee Activists. Despite the fact that the Apostles found themselves performing in various republics throughout the Soviet Union, they always remained loyal to performing in their native Armenian. In 1972, Meschian successfully graduated from university, but due to the anti-Meschian attitudes infested in the Armenian Soviet Republic, it took him two years to find a job as an architect. In 1974, Meschian was employed by the Armenian Governmental Project where he participated in the development of Zvartnots Airport in Yerevan. In 1973, he briefly joined the chorus of the Mother See of Holy Etchmiadzin, where he made the acquaintance of his Holiness Vazgen I, the Catholicos of the Armenian Apostolic Church who commissioned him to write a requiem dedicated to the martyrs of the Armenian Genocide. With Moushegh Ishkhan\u2019s permission, Meschian used some of his verses in writing the requiem. In 1975, Meschian performed his requiem at the Mother See of Holy Etchmiadzin, and with the support of the Catholicos, he later recorded the masterpiece. In the beginning of the next decade, the Apostles, unexpectedly, disappeared from the musical arena. At the time of its existence, the band featured various musicians such as Ashot Adamyan, Gevorg Mangasaryan, Viguen Stepanyan, Gevorg Jangulyan, Movses Muradyan, Ashot Eghikyan, Stanislav Buniatyan, Rostom Ohanyan and Ashot Eghikyan. In 1984, Meschian started his own musical path with his students, Vahan Artsruni and Gourgen Melikyan. In 1980\u2019s, he also got leading roles in two motion pictures. He became a part of the film, The Glowing Fire of the Night, playing the role of Michael Nalbandian. That was an opportunity for him to have his songs included in the movie. The film gave him basis to do a professional recording in the Melodia Studio of Moscow. The film highlighted three of Meschian\u2019s works, \u201CAncient Land,\u201D \u201CEpitaph\u201D and \u201CResurrection.\u201D The second film he did was \"And, Everything will Recur,\" which came out in 1989, when Meschian had already moved to the United States. In early 1980\u2019s Meschian was the leader of the Armenian Industrial Project Studio of Architecture. At the time, he had supervised the reconstruction of Lazarian Seminary in Moscow (Later the Embassy of the Armenian Republic.) He also laid out the construction of the building of Admission for the Armenian government in Yerevan, the extension building to Matenadaran, the library of Manuscripts whose construction got delayed due to the 1988 earthquake and only resumed in 2007, when Meschain was back in Yerevan. In 1989, Meschian, along with his family, moved to Boston, where he finally managed to properly record his songs. In 1990, he started performing in places such as the Armenian Church of Boston, the center of Armenian Relief Fund and The Wilshire Ebell Theatre. In 1990, he recorded his first album called Catharisis. In addition, he formed a new band called Apostles 90 with Wayne Johnson on the guitar, John Leftwich on the bass and Art Rodrigues on the drums. In 1993, Meschian released yet another album called The Monologue of the Insane Violinist, and gave a series of concerts with Apostles 90 in Pasadena, CA. In 1995, Meschian released two other albums; Wander, which included a couple of songs from the Requiem and Communion which he deems the pinnacle of his musical career. In 1996 He first performed the Communion at the First Church of Nazarene in Pasadena. Later in the same year, his Communion was performed four days in a row at the National Academic Theater for Opera and Ballet in Yerevan. In 2001, Meschian released his hit collection featuring four CDs encompassing \u201CThe monologue of a Crazy Violinist,\u201D \u201CCatharsis\u201D, \u201CCatharsis 2\u201D and \u201CCommunion.\u201D In 2003, he gave a concert at the Kodak Theater (now Dolby Theatre ) where he presented his new songs, and performed the Sayat Nova piece. In 2005, after living in the United States for 17 years, Meschian and his wife returned to Armenia. There, he gave a series of concerts which were highly esteemed and appreciated by both the general public and his long term fans who had been loyal to his art since the Soviet times. In 2007, the construction of the new section of the Mesrop Mashtots Institute of Ancient Manuscripts begins under the guidance of the chief architect Arthur Meschian. Meschian worked very hard to finish the project before schedule in 2011. Notwithstanding his busy schedule, Meschian managed to give yet another concert tour in 2009. He performed in Yerevan, Moscow, and Pasadena LA. In 2015, architect Meschian finishes yet another project. This time, he designs and conceives the first newly-built museum of Komitas in Yerevan, Armenia In 2011, Arthur Meschian is awarded with the Mesrop Mashtots Medal. In 2012, Meschian is awarded with the golden medal of the office of public construction in Yerevan, Armenia. In 2013, he is awarded with the national accolade of the Armenian Republic for his Matenataran project. As of now, despite his huge musical success, Meschian is not in a hurry to present his new musical creations."@en ;

He was a newspaper journalist before moving to Auckland at the end of 1991. New Zealand music historian John Dix wrote of New Zealand music in the 1990s, \"It wasn't all alt.rock, hip hop and hard rock in the '90s. Country rock survived with recording acts like the Coalrangers (from the wild West Coast), Glen Moffatt, Ritchie Pickett, the Renderers and the Waltons. The most successful were the Warratahs, signed to Pagan.\" Moffatt's 1995 debut album Somewhere in New Zealand Tonight was described by New Zealand Herald music critic Graham Reid as the \"birth of a Kiwi classic\". It was a finalist in country album of the year at the 1996 New Zealand recording industry awards. Moffatt was also a finalist in the rising star and songwriter of the year categories. In 1998 he released follow-up A Place to Play, of which Reid wrote, \"Moffatt has written his name large again and is, after two strong showings, a talent too big to ignore\". In 2001, as Glen Moffatt Band, came his final New Zealand album If That's What You Want. Moffatt moved to Queensland in 2002, forming a band called Glen Moffatt & the Tallboys, and in 2007 he began working with long-time Brisbane band The Smokin' Crawdads.

The son of a Klezmer band clarinetist, Michael Shapiro was born in Brooklyn, New York, and spent most of his high school years in Baldwin, a Long Island suburb, where he was a music student of Consuelo Elsa Clark, William Zurcher, and Rudolf Bosakowski. The winner of several piano competitions during his youth, he earned his B.A. at Columbia College, Columbia University, where he majored in English literature and concentrated in music, benefiting most\u2014according to his own assessment\u2014from some of the department\u2019s stellar musicology faculty, which, at that time, included such international luminaries as Paul Henry Lang, Denis Stevens, Joel Newman, and others. He studied conducting independently with Carl Bamberger at the Mannes College of Music in New York and later with Harold Farberman at Bard College. At The Juilliard School, where he earned his master\u2019s degree, he studied solf\u00E8ge and score reading with the renowned Mme.

His most influential composition teacher, however, was Elie Siegmeister, with whom he studied privately. Since 2002 Shapiro has been the music director and conductor of the Chappaqua Orchestra in New York\u2019s Westchester County, which he conducted for the world premiere of his score for the classic 1931 film Frankenstein (directed by James Whale and starring Boris Karloff) (which has since its premiere received over twenty productions nationally) as well as for the world premiere of his own orchestral work, Roller Coaster, which received its West Coast premiere under the baton of Marin Alsop in 2010 at the Cabrillo Festival of Contemporary Music while Shapiro was a composer in residence.

dbr:Roberto_Fonseca	rdf:type	umbel-rc:MusicalPerformer ;
	dbo:abstract	"Roberto Fonseca (born 1975, Havana) is a Cuban jazz pianist. From an early age, Fonseca was surrounded by music: his father was drum player Roberto Fonseca, Sr, his mother, Mercedes Cortes Alfaro, a professional singer (she sings on her son's most recent solo album, Zamazu), and his two older half-brothers from his mother's previous marriage to the pianist and musician Jes\u00FAs \"Chucho\" Vald\u00E9s are Emilio Vald\u00E9s (drums) and Jes\u00FAs \"Chuchito\" Vald\u00E9s Jr. (piano). After an early interest in drums, Fonseca switched to piano at the age of 8, and by 14 was experimenting with fusing American jazz and traditional Cuban rhythms; he appeared at Havana's Jazz Plaza Festival in 1991 when he was 15. Fonseca studied at Cuba's Instituto Superior de Arte, where he obtained a master's degree in composition, even though he often says that he was a really bad student. After earning his degree, he left Cuba to find his sound. His first album, En El Comienzo, which he recorded with Javier Zalba and the group Temperamento, was awarded Cuba's Best Jazz Album in 1999. This success encouraged him to work on two solo records: Tiene Que Ver and Elengo, combining Latin jazz, drum and bass, hip-hop, urban music and Afro-Cuban rhythms. In 2001, Fonseca went to Japan to record No Limit: Afro Cuban Jazz. He also toured with the Buena Vista Social Club the same year and has worked with Rub\u00E9n Gonz\u00E1lez, Ibrahim Ferrer, Cachaito, Guajiro Mirabal and Manuel Galb\u00E1n. A Buena Vista Social Club tour spanned the world, with over 400 concerts, promoting Ibrahim Ferrer's records next to musicians such as Cacha\u00EDto L\u00F3pez, Manuel Guajiro Mirabal and Manuel Galb\u00E1n, among others, and playing at venues such as the Frankfurt Alte Oper, Palais des Congr\u00E8s (Paris), Albert Hall (London), Beacon Theatre (New York), and the Sydney Opera House (Australia). That period of intense work, touring round the world, led Fonseca to realise that his music was ready for creating his own project. He dug deep to compose each of the songs that form Zamazu, the result of the integration of all his influences: Afro-Cuban music, jazz, classical music and traditional Cuban music. In the words of one reviewer, his recording, Zamazu, is \"a deftly varied and well-sequenced set that leaves a strong impression of who Fonseca is and promises plenty for the future.\" 2008 was a year full of work and experiences that have inspired Fonseca's new compositions, one being Columbia Pictures choosing the track \"Llego Cachaito\" from the Zamazu album for the Will Smith film Hancock. With his 2009 album, Akokan, Fonseca wanted to bring the magic, strength and improvisation from a live show to the studio. With a quartet formation and accompanied by his band, the one that he had been playing with for the past 12 years, Fonseca as the record's producer encouraged creativity and chemistry amongst the musicians. There are also two collaborations from artists that Fonseca admires, artists that have very different styles: Mayra Andrade, the Cape Verdean singer who wrote the words and sings on \"Siete potencias\", Raul Mid\u00F3n, the American guitarist, who wrote \"Second Chance\" or Yilian Ca\u00F1izares, a classically trained Swiss-Cuban violinist who mixes jazz with Cuban music. On this track Fonseca did the arrangements and Midon accompanied him on guitar. In 2010 Fonseca was the support act for Omara Portuondo's USA. After the summer his album Roberto Fonseca Live in Marciac was released. It includes a bonus DVD which features footage of the festival's 2009 show."@en ;

Shraya began writing songs at the age of 13, went on to perform and have success at various talent competitions (including winning the 2001 Futuresfest competition and finalist at 2002 Northern Alberta Singer/Songwriter Competition) until recording her debut alternative pop rock record THROAT in 2002 featuring instrumentation by Jann Arden\u2019s chief collaborator, Russell Broom. Three songs from THROAT were remixed by John Wozniak from Marcy Playground and were included on the independent release of the THROAT EP in 2003. During this time, a quietly intense, single voice and single guitar project titled Samsara: The Sketches was also recorded and released. Shraya moved to Toronto in 2003, playing at local venues and music festivals including Canadian Music Week and NXNE and released A Composite of Straight Lines, a six-track EP featuring a guest performance by Tegan Quin of Tegan and Sara. It was named the #5 record of 2005 by Soul Shine Magazine, and its single, Logic Vs., was the winner of We Are Listening's 2005 International Singer/Songwriter Awards. In 2007, Shraya changed direction entirely, releasing an electropop record titled If We\u2019re Not Talking, featuring Sara Quin of Tegan and Sara and produced by Meghan Toohey, which was reviewed and showcased positively on numerous music blogs with comparisons to Prince, Of Montreal and Justin Timberlake. This was shortly followed by the release of an electro dance cover of The White Stripes' \"Seven Nation Army\" as a free download on MySpace and Shraya's website. Shraya has toured across North America, sharing the stage with Tegan and Sara, Dragonette, Melanie C, Team Dresch, Melissa Ferrick, Brian Byrne and Greg MacPherson. She released her follow up to If We're Not Talking in the fall of 2009, titled Keys & Machines. In 2010, Shraya released the short story collection God Loves Hair.

After singing in church during her childhood, she pursued a career in gospel music as a teenager. Perry signed with Red Hill Records and released her debut studio album Katy Hudson in 2001, which was commercially unsuccessful. She moved to Los Angeles the following year to venture into secular music after Red Hill ceased operations. After being dropped by The Island Def Jam Music Group and Columbia Records, Perry signed a recording contract with Capitol Records in April 2007. Perry rose to fame in 2008 with the release of the singles \"I Kissed a Girl\" \u2013 which sparked controversy for its homosexual themes \u2013 and \"Hot n Cold\" from her second album, a pop rock record titled One of the Boys. Her third album, Teenage Dream (2010), ventured into disco, and contained the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 chart-topping singles \"California Gurls\", \"Teenage Dream\", \"Firework\", \"E.T.\", and \"Last Friday Night (T.G.I.F.)\" as well as the number-three single \"The One That Got Away\". The album became the first by a female artist to produce five number-one Billboard Hot 100 songs, and the second overall after Michael Jackson's album Bad. In March 2012, she reissued the album as Teenage Dream: The Complete Confection, which produced the songs \"Part of Me\" and \"Wide Awake\". Her fourth album, Prism, was released in 2013, and is influenced by pop and dance. She became the first artist with multiple videos to reach one billion views on Vevo with the videos for its songs \"Roar\" and \"Dark Horse\" each gaining over one billion views. Her songwriting is mostly done in collaboration with others, especially Dr. Luke and Max Martin, and in songs such as \"Firework\" and \"Roar\" she stresses themes of self-empowerment and self-esteem. Perry is known for an idiosyncratic and fun-based sense of personal fashion that incorporates bright colors and food-based themes. Her concert performances feature elaborate stagings and costumes. Perry has received many awards, including four Guinness World Records, and been included in the Forbes list of \"Top-Earning Women In Music\" (2011\u201315). Throughout her career, she has sold 11 million albums and 81 million singles worldwide. Perry has also made celebrity endorsements and released the perfumes Purr, Meow!, Killer Queen, and Mad Potion.

	dbo:abstract	"Kym Purling is an Australian pianist, composer and conductor, who was found abandoned at 2\u20133 days of age during the Vietnam War. After spending the first several months of his life in two orphanages, he was later adopted at the age of nine months to Australia, becoming the first international adoption of any nationality in Australia. Purling began formal musical training at age five or six and received his high school education at Westminster School, a private school in Adelaide, South Australia. He later completed a Bachelor of Music in Jazz Studies at the University of Adelaide, South Australia, where he formed the first Kym Purling Trio. The trio received wide recognition all around Australia and also served as the rhythm section for many of Australia's leading jazz musicians and vocalists. During this time, still in his early twenties, Purling recorded his first albums, Trio Juice, Catherine Lambert & The Kym Purling Trio and Let's Swing! In 1996, Purling served as an Ambassador for the Performing Arts between Australia and Vietnam. This was Purling's first return to his homeland since his adoption. During Purling's ambassadorship, he held sold-out concerts in concerts halls around Ho Chi Minh City and Hanoi, introducing jazz to the Vietnamese people. During the residency, Purling also taught many children, students and professional musicians and made recordings for educational purposes. He featured in many newspaper articles and radio interviews during the time he spent in Vietnam. Purling's work in Vietnam crossed many cultural and language barriers, proving that music is the universal language. He did not know any of the Vietnamese language before arriving there. Purling returned to Australia and later moved to the United States where he currently[when?] resides. As a jazz pianist, composer, conductor, arranger and educator, Purling has performed and worked throughout Australia, Malaysia, Singapore, Vietnam, the United States, Canada, Japan, Brazil, France, the United Kingdom and the Netherlands. He has opened concerts for Julio Iglesias, Harry Connick Jr., Sandra Bernhard, James Morrison, The Ray Brown Trio and Arturo Sandoval and has performed with The Mills Brothers, Buddy Greco, Kay Starr, Clint Holmes, David Cassidy and many other well-known artists. He recently performed on an hour-long national US television show with Natalie Cole. Purling later located to New York City, and worked as a musical-director and conductor of touring Broadway shows and spent the following five years traveling around 49 U.S. states, Canada and Japan, with Broadway shows Footloose, 42nd Street and Miss Saigon. Purling was later appointed as musical director, conductor and pianist for vocal legend, Engelbert Humperdinck. With Humperdinck and his band, Purling conducted and performed in many of the world's most famous concert halls and arenas around the world. Purling is an avid traveler and continues to travel and perform constantly around the world. He is hired by many major high-end luxury cruise lines around the world to perform in their showrooms and theaters aboard their ships as a guest entertainer. Purling has traveled and performed in over one hundred countries around the world. A passionate humanitarian, Purling continues to present concerts to raise funds for humanitarian and aid projects worldwide. His most recent charity performance was on May 6, 2015 in St. Petersburg, Florida where he raised many thousands of dollars to benefit the people of the recent Nepal earthquakes."@en ;

He is a Taiwanese Mandopop singer and the winner of One Million Star, Season 1 (\u7B2C\u4E00\u5B63\u8D85\u7D1A\u661F\u5149\u5927\u9053), a reality TV singing competition in Taiwan. During the competition, he once contemplated quitting due to the elimination of his good friend, Eddie Tsai (\u8521\u653F\u9716). However, show producers persuaded him to maintain his composure and regain his determination, attaining five rounds of perfect scores (20 & above) continuously after that \u2014 an unbeatable record up to now. After winning the first place in Season One, he was signed by HIM International Music along with three fellow contestants, Judy Chou (\u5468\u5B9A\u7DEF), Peter Pan (\u6F58\u88D5\u6587) and Stanly Hsu (\u8A31\u4EC1\u6770). They were dubbed the \"Four Princes of Superstar Avenue\" (\u661F\u5149\u56DB\u5C11). Lin was placed fourth on Yahoo! Taiwan 2007 Top Ten Newsworthy Personalities. On a special episode of One Million Star during the end of Season two, he gave a diversified and theatrical performance of A Little Older (\u5E74\u7D00\u5927\u4E86\u4E00\u9EDE) originally recorded and composed by Matilda Tao (\u9676\u6676\u7469). This performance impressed one of the judges on the show, Yun-Ling Huang (\u9EC3\u97FB\u73B2) so much that she dubbed Lin as the Magician of Music. At the same time, other fellow judges on the same episode heaped praises on him, exclaiming that he has improved tremendously since his winning of the Season 1 title. Before the release of his debut album titled Mystery Guest (\u795E\u79D8\u5609\u8CD3) in Taiwan on June 3, 2009, Lin has released two compilation albums and an Idol Drama soundtrack. In May\u2013June 2008, Lin set another record in Taiwan for being the youngest singer, with a yet-to-be released debut album to hold a solo concert tour in three major cities of Taiwan. He ended his Yoga's Trick Concert Tour in Hong Kong and Singapore in early 2009 and released his second album, Senses Around on October 30, 2009. His third studio album, Perfect Life, was released on May 6, 2011. His fourth studio album, fiction, was released on June 22, 2012. After beginning his 2012 to 2013 concert tour, \"FUGUE\", his latest Jazz inspired live performance compilation album JAZZ CHANNEL, was released on February 5, 2013."@en ;

Glenn Campbell Stetson was born in the Ottawa Valley (Ramsayville) of eastern Ontario and raised in Hamilton, Ontario. He was a lead singer with The Diamonds, whose hits included \"The Stroll\", \"Silhouettes\", and \"Little Darlin'\", from the late 1960s through the 1980s. He studied theater under Sir Tyrone Guthrie, and appeared in the original Broadway productions of \"H.M.S Pinafore\" and \"Funny Girl\". In the mid-1960s, he was a featured performer for Fred Waring and the Pennsylvanians. In 1968, he joined the Diamonds and helped keep their name and music alive through the 1970s and 1980s, particularly on oldies tours and TV. The Diamonds toured Australia heavily in the 1970s with Australian rock-n-roll legend Lonnie Lee. Stetson released a solo album in the 1970s entitled \"Stetson Country\" that was produced by Wayne Jackson of the famed Memphis Horns. He was a frequent guest on Nashville Now with host Ralph Emery.

He is most closely associated with the glitch, IDM, hardcore techno, and breakcore scenes. Kid606's music is similar to the work of his friend and colleague Lesser, as well as hardcore and IDM acts such as Atari Teenage Riot, Autechre, Mr. Oizo, and Matmos. He is primarily inspired not by his electronic contemporaries, but by his love of the industrial music, death metal, and industrial metal of the 1980s and 90s, particularly bands like Godflesh and Napalm Death. His music is known for its high tempo breakbeats and liberal use of noise and sampling, as well as its punk aesthetic, uninhibited genre-mixing, and irreverent sense of humor. However, he is equally adept at creating more serious tracks that often reside in the realm of ambient and glitch (\"Parenthood\" from Kill Sound Before Sound Kills You and the entirety of P.S. I Love You being good examples). Notable releases by Kid606 include Don't Sweat the Technics (VC140: 1998), Down with the Scene (IPC-7:2000), P.S. I Love You (MP93: 2000), and Kill Sound Before Sound Kills You (IPC-46:2003). He collaborated or participated in the groups Flossin, Spacewurm, Ariel and Disc. In 2005, he put together a band with a drummer and guitarist called Kid606 and Friends."@en ;

He is a member of the Korean pop group JYJ, and was one of the original members of boy band TVXQ. Kim made his debut in 2003 as a member of TVXQ, a boy band produced and formed by South Korean record label and talent agency S.M. Entertainment, having previously been a trainee for six years. He had released four Korean albums, four Japanese albums, thirty Japanese singles and several Korean singles during his first six years in the music industry as TVXQ. In 2009, Kim and fellow TVXQ members Kim Jaejoong and Park Yoochun filed a lawsuit against SM Entertainment, arguing that their exclusive contracts were unilaterally disadvantageous towards the artists and should be invalidated. The Seoul Central District Court ruled in favor of the three and granted an injunction suspending their contracts. The trio reunited and subsequently formed JYJ (formerly known as JUNSU/JAEJOONG/YOOCHUN in Japan). As JYJ, Kim has released one English album, two Korean albums, one Japanese EP, and one Korean EP. Kim began his solo career in 2010 with the release of Japanese single Xiah, which peaked at number-two on Japan's Oricon singles chart. The same year, he took the role of Wolfgang in his debut musical Mozart!, receiving critical acclaim and commercial success. After the release of Xiah, Kim's solo music career was sent into hiatus because of a discord between him and his Japanese label Avex Trax that led to the sudden suspension of all his activities in Japan. In May 2012, he released his first full-length Korean solo studio album Tarantallegra, while being represented by new management agency C-JeS Entertainment. Following the release, he embarked on his first headlining world tour. He returned with his second Korean solo studio album, Incredible, in July 2013. Despite limitations in media coverage and promotional activities caused by a ban in the Entertainment Departments of South Korea's three main terrestrial broadcasters resulting from SM Entertainment's interference, Kim's first and second studio album reached top two on the Gaon albums chart in South Korea, as well as reaching number-ten and number-five on the Billboard World Albums chart for Tarantallegra and Incredible, respectively. He is also known for being able to sell out tickets for his concerts and musicals within minutes, dubbed \"the ticket power\" by South Korean media."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Cantor Mikhail Girgis El Batanouny (also title Mu'allim, which is Arabic for \"teacher\") (14 September 1873 - 18 April 1957) was an expert in Coptic music, and knowledgeable in church rites, in addition to being skilled in the languages of Coptic and Arabic. He was also the distinguished leader of cantors in the Great Cathedral, and was appointed to be the first instructor of hymns in the Coptic Orthodox Clerical College by Archdeacon Habib Girgis. When the Institute of Coptic Studies was established, Cantor Mikhail was appointed to be its first teacher of hymns. The hymns from Cantor Mikhail were the source of the vocal notes recorded by Professor Ernest Newlandsmith, a musicologist from Oxford University, with the help of Dr. Ragheb Moftah. In addition, Cantor Mikhail conducted the first audio recording of Coptic music. In light of this great achievement, Dr. Ragheb Moftah commented, \"He was the only way of passing down Coptic hymns in its original form to us.\" And for all of these reasons, and many others, Cantor Mikhail el-Batanouni is considered to be the master of Coptic hymnology throughout Egypt. Hence, he is frequently referred to as \"Cantor Mikhail the Great\". At the end of his journey, on 18 April 1957, Cantor Mikhail the Great departed, at the age of 83, after diligently serving the Coptic Orthodox Church for approximately 70 years. He left a great heritage of music, which was preserved by Dr. Ragheb Moftah in the United States Library of Congress. In addition, it was also cherished in the hearts and tongues of the cantors, who continuously chant them in their churches to this day. In an effort to express his deep sorrow for the lost of Cantor Mikhail, Dr. Ragheb Moftah had these words to say in his lamentation: \"You are like the River Nile that overflows to every corner of its valley. Your teachings have flooded the nations to its uttermost regions, and behold, they declare your name and everlasting treasure, as are the Pyramids that overlook the centuries. Your hymns, which the valley has echoed for thousands of years, you have preserved them for us, in a generation of alteration and change. Oh you of great heart! You have departed from this narrow place, and your spirit has joined in the world beyond, praising and chanting throughout the entire universe, glorifying the Holy of Holies.\" Source: Summarized from A Recent History of Coptic Hymns by Albair Gamal Mikhail, head of the Heritage of the Coptic Orthodox Church."@en ;
