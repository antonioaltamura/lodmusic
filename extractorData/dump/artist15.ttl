	dbo:abstract	"Amanda Leigh \"Mandy\" Moore (born April 10, 1984) is an American singer, songwriter and actress. Moore first came to prominence with her 1999 debut single, \"Candy\", which peaked at number 41 on the Billboard Hot 100. After signing with Epic Records, she released her first album, So Real, in 1999. It went on to receive a Platinum certification from the RIAA. Her 2000 single, \"I Wanna Be with You\", became her first Top 30 song in the US, peaking at number 24 on the Hot 100 chart. The parent album of the same name was released that same year to generally mixed reviews. The album went on to achieve Gold certification. After revealing her displeasure with her early works, Moore's self-titled third album, Mandy Moore (2001), featured a change of sound that drifted away from her \"bubblegum pop\" roots. The album spawned the single \"In My Pocket\", which became her third Top 20 song in Australia. The album itself was her final album to be certified by the RIAA, receiving a Gold certification. In 2003, Moore released her fourth studio album, Coverage, featuring covers of classic 1970s songs. Following the album's release, Moore parted ways with Epic due to creative differences. The split prompted the label to release the compilation albums The Best of Mandy Moore (2004) and Candy (2005), both of which have sold an estimated 100,000 copies to date. Moore did not return to music until the release of her 2007 album Wild Hope, which failed to have much success. To date, the album has sold an estimated 200,000 copies, and failed to receive an RIAA certification. Similarly, both of the album's singles failed to chart worldwide. In 2009, Moore released her sixth studio album, Amanda Leigh, which peaked at number 25 on the Billboard 200 and sold an estimated 100,000 copies. In 2012, Moore confirmed that she was working on her seventh studio album. As of 2009, Moore has sold more than 15 million albums worldwide, according to Billboard. In 2012, Moore was ranked #96 on VH1's list of \"100 Greatest Women in Music\", as well as #63 on their Sexiest Artists of All Time List. Outside of her musical career, Moore has also branched out into acting. She made her film debut in the 2001 comedy film Dr. Dolittle 2, though it was only a minor voice role. Later that year, she appeared as Lana Thomas in the comedy film The Princess Diaries, alongside Anne Hathaway. She had her first starring role as Jamie Sullivan in the 2002 romantic drama film A Walk to Remember, which was based on Nicholas Sparks' novel. Between 2003 and 2006, Moore starred in various films, including How to Deal (2003), Chasing Liberty (2004) and Saved! (2004). She later co-starred in the 2006 satirical comedy American Dreamz, which was both a critical and financial failure. The film failed to make back its $17 million budget, and debuted at number 9 at the box office. The following year, Moore co-starred in the romantic comedies Because I Said So and License to Wed. In 2010, Moore voiced Rapunzel in the animated film Tangled, in which she performed the duet \"I See the Light\" with Zachary Levi; the song won a Grammy for Best Song Written for Visual Media. She later reprised the role in the short film Tangled Ever After, and will do so again in a Disney Channel television series based on the film in 2017. She has also voiced the character in several video games."@en .

	dbo:abstract	"Marianne Evelyn Gabriel Faithfull (born 29 December 1946) is an English singer, songwriter and actress. She achieved popularity in the 1960s with the release of her hit single \"As Tears Go By\" and became one of the lead female artists during the \"British Invasion\" in the United States. Born in Hampstead, London, Faithfull began her career in 1964 after attending The Rolling Stones party where she was discovered by Andrew Loog Oldham. After the release of her hit single \"As Tears Go By\", she became an international star. Her debut album Marianne Faithfull (1965) (released simultaneously with her album Come My Way) was a commercial success followed by a number of albums on Decca Records. From 1966 to 1970, she had a highly publicised romantic relationship with Mick Jagger. Her popularity was further enhanced by her film roles, such as I'll Never Forget What's'isname (1967), The Girl on a Motorcycle (1968), and Hamlet (1969). However, her popularity was overshadowed by personal struggles in the 1970s. During that time she suffered from heroin addiction, alcoholism, and anorexia. After a long commercial absence, Faithfull made a comeback with the 1979 release of her critically acclaimed album Broken English. The album was a commercial success and marked a resurgence of her musical career. Broken English earned Faithfull a nomination for Grammy Award for Best Female Rock Vocal Performance and is often regarded as her \"definitive recording.\" She followed with a series of albums, including Dangerous Acquaintances (1981), A Child's Adventure (1983), and Strange Weather (1987). Faithfull also wrote three books about her life: Faithfull: An Autobiography (1994), Memories, Dreams & Reflections (2007), and Marianne Faithfull: A Life on Record (2014). Faithfull is listed on VH1's \"100 Greatest Women of Rock and Roll\" list.

Born in Ridgecrest, California, Hoppus spent his childhood moving back and forth between his mother and father's houses, as they divorced when he was in third grade. He became interested in skateboarding and punk rock in junior high, and received a bass guitar from his father at the age of fifteen. After moving to San Diego in 1992, Hoppus' sister introduced him to Tom DeLonge, and together with drummer Scott Raynor, they formed the band Blink-182. Following Raynor and DeLonge's departures from the band in 1998 and 2015, respectively, Hoppus is now the only remaining founding member of Blink-182. Blink-182 produced several rock recordings and toured exhaustively before signing to major label MCA to co-distribute their sophomore effort, 1997's Dude Ranch, which featured the Hoppus-penned hit \"Dammit\". After replacing Raynor with Travis Barker, the trio recorded Enema of the State (1999), which launched the band into multiplatinum success, becoming the biggest pop punk act of the era. Two more records followed\u2014the heavier Take Off Your Pants and Jacket (2001) and the more experimental Blink-182 (2003)\u2014before the band split in 2005 following internal tension. Hoppus continued playing with Barker in +44 in the late 2000s. Blink-182 reunited in 2009 and have since released two new recordings and have toured worldwide. Aside from his musical career, Hoppus has had multiple successes behind the recording console, producing records for groups such as Idiot Pilot, New Found Glory, The Matches, and Motion City Soundtrack.

He is the founder of the record label No Limit Records, which was relaunched as New No Limit Records through Universal Records and Koch Records, then again as Guttar Music Entertainment, and finally, currently, No Limit Forever Records. He is the founder and CEO of P. Miller Enterprises, a conglomerate company, and Better Black Television, a cable television network. Miller gained fame in the mid-1990s with the success of his hip hop music group TRU as well as his fifth solo rap album Ice Cream Man, which contained his first single \"Mr. Ice Cream Man\". In 1997, after the success of one of his biggest singles to date, \"Make 'Em Say Uhh!\", went double platinum, Miller grew further in popularity. Then Miller released his second platinum album Ghetto D. Miller also starred in his own street film, mostly based on his life, I'm Bout It. In 1998, P. Miller released his most successful album to date, MP Da Last Don. The album was also based on a film that Miller produced, which came out earlier that year with the same name. The album hit number 1 on the Billboard Top 200 chart, selling over 400,000 copies in a week. The album was certified 4\u00D7 platinum, with over four million copies sold, making it Miller's highest selling album.  In 1999, Miller released his eighth album, Only God Can Judge Me. It was not as successful as his previous album, though it reached a gold certification. Miller also starred in the movie I Got the Hook Up, with A. J. Johnson, and created the soundtrack of the same name. On November 28, 2000, he released his ninth album, Ghetto Postage, which sold 500,000 copies, but it did not compare to his earlier more successful releases. In the early 2000s, as No Limit Records popularity was slowly declining, so was Miller's. Miller re-launched No Limit Records as New No Limit Records. In 2001 Miller released his tenth album entitled Game Face. In 2003, Miller starred in the film Lockdown. In 2004, Miller released his eleventh album, Good Side, Bad Side; it charted number 1 on the Billboard Independent Albums chart and sold 300,000 copies. The same year, Miller released his first independent album Living Legend: Certified D-Boy on his new label Guttar Music. In 2013 Forbes estimated Miller's net worth at nearly $350 million, which put him as the third-richest figure in hip hop at the time. On December 6, 2013, Miller released his thirteenth studio album The Gift on his newly founded label No Limit Forever Records. On November 27, 2015, Miller released his fourteenth album, entitled Empire, from the Hood to Hollywood."@en .

	dbo:abstract	"Melora Creager (born March 25, 1966) is an American cellist, singer-songwriter, performing artist and founder of the cello rock group Rasputina. In 1991, Creager founded alternative cello ensemble Rasputina by writing a manifesto and placing a want-ad in the Village Voice stating \"electric cellists wanted\". Cellist/composer Julia Kent was the first respondent. Rasputina performed regularly at NYC venues such as CBGB's Gallery, Brownie's and Fez before being signed to Columbia Records in 1996, for whom they subsequently made two albums. With varying members, Creager has made five more albums as Rasputina, and multiple shorter releases. Creager also played cello for Nirvana on the European leg of the In Utero world tour (including the band's final show in Munich). Creager designed all the Rasputina album covers excepting one- Lost & Found, which was designed by artist Ryan Obermeyer and included in the 44th Annual Society of Illustrators Exhibition in New York, 2002. From 1988- 1996, Creager was employed as a jewelry designer for Erickson Beamon, creating costume jewelry for Anna Sui, Donna Karan, Barney's New York, and Vogue magazine. She continues her relationship with Anna Sui, occasionally designing fashion show invitations and T-shirts. Through more than seven albums and frequent touring, Creager through Rasputina has been an originator of and influence on such movements as Freak folk  and Steampunk. Creager makes unique use of historical events and figures in her lyrics and themes. Inspirations include the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire of 1911, Howard Hughes, Rose Kennedy, victims of Josef Mengele, Emily Dickinson, Pitcairn Island, Columbia County, NY. Combining history and humor in song-form and spoken-word pieces, Creager is also unique in exploring women's history through pop music."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Merle Ronald Haggard (April 6, 1937 \u2013 April 6, 2016) was an American singer, songwriter, guitarist, and fiddler. Along with Buck Owens, Haggard and his band the Strangers helped create the Bakersfield sound, which is characterized by the twang of Fender Telecaster and the unique mix with the traditional country steel guitar sound, new vocal harmony styles in which the words are minimal, and a rough edge not heard on the more polished Nashville sound recordings of the same era. Haggard's childhood was troubled after the death of his father, and he was incarcerated several times in his youth. He managed to turn his life around and launch a successful country music career, gaining popularity with his songs about the working class that occasionally contained themes contrary to the prevailing anti-Vietnam War sentiment of much popular music of the time. Between the 1960s and the 1980s, he had 38 number-one hits on the US country charts, several of which also made the Billboard all-genre singles chart. Haggard continued to release successful albums into the 2000s. He received many honors and awards for his music, including a Kennedy Center Honor (2010), a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award (2006), a BMI Icon Award (2006), and induction into the Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame (1977), Country Music Hall of Fame (1994) and Oklahoma Music Hall of Fame (1997). He died on April 6, 2016 \u2014 his 79th birthday \u2014 at his ranch in Northern California, having recently suffered from double pneumonia. Haggard's last recording, a song called \"Kern River Blues\", described his departure from Bakersfield in the late 1970s and his displeasure with politicians. The song was recorded February 9, 2016, and features his son Ben on guitar. This record was released on May 12, 2016, marking the end of Haggard's music career."@en ;

He scored for the films Zorba the Greek (1964), Z (1969), and Serpico (1973). He composed the \"Mauthausen Trilogy\" also known as \"The Ballad of Mauthausen\", which has been described as the \"most beautiful musical work ever written about the Holocaust\" and possibly his best work. He is viewed as Greece's best-known living composer. He was awarded the Lenin Peace Prize. Politically, he is associated with the left because of his long-standing ties to the Communist Party of Greece. He was an MP for the KKE from 1981 to 1990. Nevertheless, in 1989 he ran as an independent candidate within the centre-right New Democracy party, in order for the country to emerge from the political crisis that had been created due to the numerous scandals of the government of Andreas Papandreou, and helped establish a large coalition between conservatives, socialists and leftists. In 1990 he was elected to the parliament (as in 1964 and 1981), became a government minister under Constantine Mitsotakis, and fought against drugs and terrorism and for culture, education and better relations between Greece and Turkey. He continues to speak out in favor of left-liberal causes, Greek\u2013Turkish\u2013Cypriot relations, and against the War in Iraq. He has consistently opposed oppressive regimes and was a key voice against the 1967\u20131974 Greek junta, which imprisoned him."@en ;

He has been called \"Iran's greatest living master of traditional Persian music.\" Shajarian is also known for his skills in Persian calligraphy, and humanitarian activities. Shajarian was born in Mashhad, Iran, and started singing at the age of five, under the supervision of his father. At the age of twelve, he began studying the traditional classical repertoire known as the Radif. Shajarian started his singing career in 1959 at Radio Khorasan, rising to prominence in the 1960s with his distinct style of singing. His main teachers were Ahmad Ebadi, Esmaeil Mehrtash, Abdollah Davami, and Nour-Ali Boroumand. He also learned the vocal styles of singers from previous generations, including Reza Gholi Mirza Zelli, Fariborz Manouchehri, Ghamar Molouk Vaziri, Eghbal Azar, and Taj Isfahani. When giving a lecture at California State University, Sacramento, on March 2, 2012, he was asked what teacher was most influential to his development, and he cited legendary Iranian tar musician Jalil Shahnaz, indicating that Shahnaz' playing style was what he most tried to mimic with his own singing style. Shajarian has collaborated with Parviz Meshkatian, Mohammad Reza Lotfi, Hossein Alizadeh, and Faramarz Payvar. He is recognised as skilled singer in the challenging traditional Dastgah style. In 1999 UNESCO in France presented him with the Picasso Award and in 2006 with the UNESCO Mozart Medal. In March 2016, Shajarian announced that he has been diagnosed with Kidney tumour for the past fifteen years. He appeared with shaved hair in his Nowrouz congratulation video, published on his Youtube account."@en .

	dbo:abstract	"Monica Denise Brown, (n\u00E9e Arnold; born October 24, 1980), simply known as Monica, is an American singer, songwriter, producer, and actress. Born and raised in College Park, Georgia, she began performing as a child and became part of a traveling gospel choir at the age of ten. She rose to prominence after releasing her debut studio album Miss Thang in 1995. It went multiplatinum, while its first two singles \"Don't Take It Personal\" and \"Before You Walk Out of My Life\" made her the youngest recording act to ever have two consecutive chart-topping hits on the Billboard Top R&B Singles chart. In 1998, Monica's second album The Boy Is Mine earned her major international chart success. Pushed by its Grammy Award-winning number-one hit title track, a duet with singer Brandy, it spawned two further Billboard Hot 100 chart-toppers, \"The First Night\" and \"Angel of Mine\", and established her position as one of the most successful of the urban R&B female vocalists to emerge in the mid to late-1990s. Monica also ventured into acting, with a supporting role in Boys and Girls (2000), and starring roles in television film Love Song (2000). During the production of her third album, All Eyez on Me (2002), Monica experienced personal struggles and her career went under hiatus. In 2003, her fourth album, After the Storm, was released, and after an unsuccessful period, she scored her fifth number one single on the US R&B/Hip Hop, \"So Gone\". The album also included her Top 20 Billboard Hot 100 hit \"U Should've Known Better\". Her sixth album, Still Standing, which recording was tracked by her BET reality show Monica: Still Standing, was released in 2010 and produced the hit single \"Everything to Me\", which became her sixth number one hit on the US R&B/Hip Hop. Monica has sold more than 30 million albums worldwide, including over 5.3 million albums in the United States alone. With a career lasting over 20 years, she became the first artist to top the US Billboard Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart in the 1990s, 2000s, and 2010s. In 2010, Billboard listed Monica at number 24 on its list of the Top 50 R&B and Hip Hop Artists of the past 25 years."@en ;

Born into a musical family, she signed with Interscope Records in 1998 and released her eponymous debut album the same year. The album was a commercial success in the United States and produced the top ten single \"It's All About Me\". Fear of Flying, her second album, was released in 2000 and became a worldwide success, boosted by the success of its second single \"Case of the Ex\".

	dbo:abstract	"Namie Amuro (\u5B89\u5BA4\u5948\u7F8E\u6075 Amuro Namie, born September 20, 1977) is a Japanese singer, dancer, fashion model, actress and businesswoman. She achieved popularity by a series of successful singles and albums, both exploring different genres and working with producers and musicians outside of Japan, one of the first Japanese artists to do so at the time. Due to her longevity and resilience in the industry, she has been often referred by critics and music publications as the \"Teen Queen\" of Japan, \"Queen of J-Pop\", and the \"Japanese Madonna or Janet Jackson\". Born in Naha, Okinawa, Amuro debuted in music as an idol girl with the band Super Monkey's at age 14. Although majority of their releases were unsuccessful in Japan, Amuro's venturing in modelling fashion and acting helped the group gain attention on their single \"Try Me (Watashi o Shinjite)\". Retitling themselves as \"Namie Amuro with Super Monkey\u2019s\" to achieve further success, they released a studio album and a compilation. She signed with Avex Trax in 1995 to released her debut single \u201C\"Body Feels Exit\", the lead single from her best-selling album Sweet 19 Blues (1996). She achieved large success with her single \"Can You Celebrate?\", which is still the best-selling single from a female artist in Japan. Transitioning into westernised R&B music, she released her third album Genius 2000 (2000). As she was beginning to mould her well-known signature R&B sound, sales started to decline by the release of her fifth album Style (2003). But in 2007, Play, her eight studio album, was a period of her resurgence with sales. She then moved from R&B, onto electronic dance music with her tenth album Uncontrolled (2012), and has since recorded primarily in English language, including her most recent album Genic (2015). Though Amuro has been credited as a record producer and songwriter in some of her releases, she has remained solely as a recording artist, with many of her singles hitting number one including \"Chase the Chance\", \"A Walk in the Park\", \"Dreaming I Was Dreaming\", \"I Have Never Seen\", \"Wild\", and an extended play single 60s 70s 80s. Alongside this, her compilation albums 181920 (1998) and Best Fiction (2008) are two of the best-selling greatest hits albums in Japan. Having sold more than 30 million records in Japan, Namie Amuro is recognized as the 12th best-selling artist, the fourth best-selling solo artist, and third best-selling female artist in that region according to The Richest. She has been recognized at several award ceremonies, including being a recipient at the World Music Awards, Japan Record Awards, Japan Gold Disc Awards, amongst many others. Recording to calculated results by the Recording Industry Association of Japan (RIAJ), she has a total of 43 million certified units. Her album Sweet 19 Blues was the best-selling album of Japan, until it was released by several more entries during most recent years."@en ;

He has also recorded several successful solo albums and assembled diverse musicians for the 7 Worlds Collide project; contributor Ed O'Brien, also guitarist for Radiohead, has hailed Finn as popular music's \"most prolific writer of great songs\". Finn rose to prominence in the late 1970s with Split Enz and wrote the successful songs \"One Step Ahead\", \"History Never Repeats\", \"I Got You\" and \"Message to My Girl\", among others. Finn rose from prominence to international fame after Split Enz broke up in 1984. While his brother Tim Finn left for England, Neil was the founder of Crowded House with Split Enz's final drummer Paul Hester in 1985. The group achieved international success in 1987 when they released the single \"Don't Dream It's Over\", written by Neil Finn. He ended Crowded House in 1996 to embark upon what was to become a moderately successful solo career, and has released two albums with his brother Tim under the title the Finn Brothers. In 2006, following the death of Hester, Finn reformed Crowded House (adding Beck's former drummer Matt Sherrod) and released their first studio album in over 13 years, Time on Earth, and the band began a world tour. In 2010, Finn commenced another world tour with Crowded House in support of their 2010 release, Intriguer. In February 2014 Finn released his third solo album \"Dizzy Heights.\""@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Catharina \"Nina\" Hagen (born March 11, 1955) is a German singer, songwriter, and actress. She is known for her theatrical vocals and is often referred to as the \"Godmother of Punk\" due to her prominence during the punk and new wave movements in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Born in the former East Berlin, German Democratic Republic, Hagen began her career as an actress when she appeared in several German films alongside her mother Eva-Maria Hagen. Around that same time, she joined the band Automobil and released the single \"Du hast den Farbfilm vergessen\". After her stepfather Wolf Biermann's East German citizenship was withdrawn from him in 1976, Hagen followed him to Hamburg. Shortly afterwards, she was offered a record deal from CBS Records and formed Nina Hagen Band. Their self-titled debut album was released in 1978 to a critical acclaim and was a commercial success selling over 250,000 copies. The band released one more album Unbehagen before their break-up in 1979. In 1982, Hagen signed a new contract with CBS and released her debut solo album NunSexMonkRock, which became her first record to chart in the United States. She followed it with two more albums: Fearless (1983) and Nina Hagen in Ekstasy (1985), before her contract with CBS expired and was not renewed. In 1989, she was offered a record deal from Mercury Records. She released three albums on the label: Nina Hagen (1989), Street (1991), and Revolution Ballroom (1993). However, none of the albums achieved notable commercial success. Hagen made her musical comeback with the release of her album Return of the Mother (2000). Besides her musical career, Hagen is also a voice-over actress. She wrote three autobiographies: Ich bin ein Berliner (1988), Nina Hagen: That's Why the Lady Is a Punk (2003), and Bekenntnisse (2010). She is also noted for her human and animal rights activism."@en ;

Born in North Carolina, the sixth child of a preacher, Simone aspired to be a concert pianist. With the help of the few supporters in her hometown of Tryon, North Carolina, she enrolled in the Juilliard School of Music in New York. Waymon then applied for a scholarship to study at the prestigious Curtis Institute of Music in Philadelphia, where she was denied despite a well-received audition. Simone became fully convinced this rejection had been entirely due to her race, a statement that has been a matter of controversy. Years later, two days before her death, the Curtis Institute of Music bestowed an honorary degree on Simone. To make a living, Eunice Waymon changed her name to \"Nina Simone\". The change related to her need to disguise herself from family members, having chosen to play \"the devil's music\" or \"cocktail piano\" at a nightclub in Atlantic City. She was told in the nightclub that she would have to sing to her own accompaniment, and this effectively launched her career as a jazz vocalist. Simone recorded more than forty albums, mostly between 1958, when she made her debut with Little Girl Blue, and 1974, and had a hit in the United States in 1958 with \"I Loves You, Porgy\". Simone's musical style fused gospel and pop with classical music, in particular Johann Sebastian Bach, and accompanied expressive, jazz-like singing in her contralto voice."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Patricia Louise Holt-Edwards (born May 24, 1944) better known under the stage name Patti LaBelle, is an American singer, author, actress, and entrepreneur. LaBelle began her career in the early 1960s as lead singer and front woman of the vocal group, Patti LaBelle and the Bluebelles. Following the group's name change to Labelle in the early 1970s, she released the iconic disco song \"Lady Marmalade\" and the group later became the first African-American vocal group to land the cover of Rolling Stone magazine. After the group split in 1976, LaBelle began a successful solo career, starting with her critically acclaimed debut album, which included the career-defining song, \"You Are My Friend\". LaBelle became a mainstream solo star in 1984 following the success of the singles, \"If Only You Knew\", \"New Attitude\" and \"Stir It Up\", with the latter two crossing over to pop audiences becoming radio staples. Less than two years later, in 1986, LaBelle scored with the number-one album, Winner in You and the number-one duet single, \"On My Own\", with Michael McDonald. LaBelle eventually won a 1992 Grammy for Best Female R&B Vocal Performance for her 1991 album, Burnin', followed by a second Grammy win for the live album, Live! One Night Only. Her 1990s albums, Burnin', Gems (1994) and Flame (1997), continued her popularity with young R&B audiences throughout the decade. Following the release of two mildly receptive solo albums in the early new millennium, she reunited with her Labelle band mates for the album, Back to Now, followed by a briefly well received promotional tour. LaBelle's success has extended as an actress with a notable role in the film, A Soldier's Story, and in TV shows such as A Different World and American Horror Story: Freak Show. In 1992, LaBelle starred in her own TV sitcom, Out All Night. A decade later, LaBelle hosted her own lifestyle TV show, Living It Up with Patti LaBelle on TV One. In 2015, LaBelle took part in the dance competition, Dancing with the Stars. In a career that has spanned fifty years, she has sold more than 50 million records worldwide. LaBelle has been inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame, the Hollywood Walk of Fame, the Apollo Theater Hall of Fame and the Songwriters' Hall of Fame. In 2005, the World Music Awards recognized her years in the music business by awarding her the Legend Award. Possessing the voice of a soprano, LaBelle was included in Rolling Stone on their list of 100 Greatest Singers. LaBelle is commonly identified as the \"Godmother of Soul\"."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Clara Ann Fowler (November 8, 1927 \u2013 January 1, 2013), known by her professional name Patti Page, was an American singer of traditional pop music. She was the top-charting female vocalist and best-selling female artist of the 1950s, selling over 100 million records during a six decade long career. She was often introduced as \"the Singin' Rage, Miss Patti Page\". New York WNEW disc-jockey William B. Williams introduced her as \"A Page in my life called Patti\". Page signed with Mercury Records in 1947, and became their first successful female artist, starting with 1948's \"Confess\". In 1950, she had her first million-selling single \"With My Eyes Wide Open, I'm Dreaming\", and would eventually have 14 additional million-selling singles between 1950 and 1965. Page's signature song, \"Tennessee Waltz\", was one of the biggest-selling singles of the 20th century, and is recognized today as one of the official songs of the state of Tennessee. It spent 13 weeks atop the Billboard magazine's Best-Sellers List in 1950. Page had three additional No. 1 hit singles between 1950 and 1953, \"All My Love (Bolero)\", \"I Went to Your Wedding\", and \"(How Much Is That) Doggie in the Window\". Unlike most pop music singers, Page blended country music styles into many of her most popular songs. As a result of this crossover appeal, many of Page's singles appeared on the Billboard Country Chart. Towards the 1970s, she shifted her career towards country music and began having greater success on its charts, ending up one of the few vocalists to have made them in five separate decades. With the rise of Rock and Roll in the second half of the 1950s, traditional pop music began to wane. Page was among a small number of traditional pop music singers able to sustain success, continuing to have major hits into the mid-1960s with \"Old Cape Cod\", \"Allegheny Moon\", \"A Poor Man's Roses (Or a Rich Man's Gold)\", and \"Hush, Hush, Sweet Charlotte\". In 1997, Patti Page was inducted into the Oklahoma Music Hall of Fame. She was posthumously honored with the Lifetime Achievement Grammy Award in 2013."@en ;

He was inducted into Canada's Walk of Fame in 2005. In 1983, he co-wrote the song \"I Never Heard\" with Michael Jackson. It was retitled and released in 2009 under the name \"This Is It\". An additional song that Jackson co-wrote with Anka from this 1983 session, \"Love Never Felt So Good\", was since discovered and was released on Jackson's posthumous album Xscape in 2014. The song was also released by Johnny Mathis in 1984. Anka became a naturalized US citizen in 1990."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Paul D'Amour (born May 12, 1967) is an American musician, and the first bass guitarist for Tool. His bass sound was recognized by the aggressive picked tone he developed with his Chris Squire Signature Rickenbacker 4001CS, which can clearly be heard on Tool's first full-length album, Undertow. D'Amour was born in Spokane, Washington. Originally a guitar player, D'Amour became Tool's bassist after being introduced to the band by guitarist Adam Jones. Like Jones, D'Amour was in Los Angeles because of his wish to enter the film industry. D'Amour left Tool in 1995. After his departure from the band, he formed the psychedelic pop band Lusk with Brad Laner, Chris Pitman, now of Guns N' Roses, and Greg Edwards of Failure and Autolux. In 1997, they released their only album, entitled Free Mars. Soon after his departure from Tool, D'Amour played guitar in a group named Replicants, a cover band that included Ken Andrews and Greg Edwards from Failure, as well as Chris Pitman. They released one self-titled album in 1995, with a guest appearance from former Tool band-mate, Maynard James Keenan. As of early 2005, D'Amour has been writing and performing under the name Feersum Ennjin. The name is inspired by the science fiction novel Feersum Endjinn by Iain Banks, an author whose novel The Wasp Factory was conceptual inspiration for Lusk as well. The project released a self-titled EP on Silent Uproar Records. In 2011, a self-titled LP was released on Dissociated Press, featuring some songs that had been released previously and some new ones. On the first track of the LP, \"The Fourth\", former Tool band-mate Danny Carey plays drums. Currently, D'Amour plays bass in the band Lesser Key. The group consists of Andrew Zamudio (vocals), Brett Fanger (guitar), and Justin Hanson (drums). The band \"represents an exploration into personal and artistic freedom.\" On July 26, 2013, the band released a video of their debut single \"Intercession.\" Their debut EP was produced by former Tool producer Sylvia Massy and released on April 1, 2014 on Sumerian Records."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Peter \"Pete\" Seeger (May 3, 1919 \u2013 January 27, 2014) was an American folk singer and social activist. A fixture on nationwide radio in the 1940s, he also had a string of hit records during the early 1950s as a member of the Weavers, most notably their recording of Lead Belly's \"Goodnight, Irene\", which topped the charts for 13 weeks in 1950. Members of the Weavers were blacklisted during the McCarthy Era. In the 1960s, he re-emerged on the public scene as a prominent singer of protest music in support of international disarmament, civil rights, counterculture and environmental causes. A prolific songwriter, his best-known songs include \"Where Have All the Flowers Gone?\" (with Joe Hickerson), \"If I Had a Hammer (The Hammer Song)\" (with Lee Hays of the Weavers), and \"Turn! Turn! Turn!\" (lyrics adapted from Ecclesiastes), which have been recorded by many artists both in and outside the folk revival movement and are sung throughout the world. \"Flowers\" was a hit recording for the Kingston Trio (1962); Marlene Dietrich, who recorded it in English, German and French (1962); and Johnny Rivers (1965). \"If I Had a Hammer\" was a hit for Peter, Paul and Mary (1962) and Trini Lopez (1963), while the Byrds had a number one hit with \"Turn! Turn! Turn!\" in 1965. Seeger was one of the folksingers most responsible for popularizing the spiritual \"We Shall Overcome\" (also recorded by Joan Baez and many other singer-activists) that became the acknowledged anthem of the Civil Rights Movement, soon after folk singer and activist Guy Carawan introduced it at the founding meeting of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) in 1960. In the PBS American Masters episode \"Pete Seeger: The Power of Song\", Seeger stated it was he who changed the lyric from the traditional \"We will overcome\" to the more singable \"We shall overcome\"."@en ;

His career with the Who spans over 50 years, during which time the band grew to be considered one of the most influential bands of the 20th century. Townshend is the main songwriter for The Who, having written well over 100 songs for the band's 11 studio albums, including concept albums and the rock operas Tommy and Quadrophenia, plus popular rock radio staples such as Who's Next, and dozens more that appeared as non-album singles, bonus tracks on reissues, and tracks on rarities compilations such as Odds & Sods (1974).

	dbo:abstract	"Peter Trewavas (born 15 January 1959, Middlesbrough, North Yorkshire, England) is an English musician. He joined Marillion in 1982, taking over the role of bassist, from Diz Minnitt, while acting occasionally as a backing vocalist and acoustic guitarist. Although he was born in Middlesbrough, Trewavas spent much of his childhood in the Buckinghamshire town of Aylesbury. It was in Aylesbury that he became involved in several bands, having most success with The Metros, before taking up his long term role in Marillion. Although still a full member of Marillion, in recent years, Trewavas has also become a member of the progressive rock supergroup, Transatlantic. In 2004, Trewavas co-founded another group called Kino, with John Mitchell (Arena), John Beck (It Bites) and Chris Maitland (ex-Porcupine Tree). In 2011, Pete Trewavas joined up with his longtime friend Eric Blackwood to form the duo Edison's Children. The new project was designed to be a creative outlet for Pete Trewavas (who has traditionally recorded in a \"band\" or \"group\" format on bass and acoustic guitar), in which he could also play lead guitar, lead vocals, drum programming and keyboards as well as have full creative control over the writing and producing of the record with. The 72-minute concept album In The Last Waking Moments... about a man fighting to understand if a recent bizarre happening was reality or a descent into madness, was released on 11.11.11. The Edison's Children project would result in the release of the single \"A Million Miles Away (I Wish I Had A Time Machine)\". The song debuted on American Commercial Radio in June 2012 and by September it had reached the FMQB U.S. Commercial Radio Top 40 where it remained for 10 weeks (and stayed in the top 100 for 25 weeks) peaking at No. 32. Edison's Children did live performances in Montreal, Wolverhampton England and Port Zelande Netherlands opening up for Marillion's \"Brave\" performances during the Marillion 2013 Weekend. The Montreal show was recorded and released as a B-Side on their \"In the Last Waking Moments...\"-EP Single. The UK show was released on their latest album \"Somewhere Between Here and There\". Edison's Children released their second album, The Final Breath Before November, on 13 December 2013. It was mixed by Jakko Jakszyk, lead singer of King Crimson, John Mitchell, lead guitarist of It Bites, and Arena and Robin Boult, lead guitarist of Fish. The album featured Eric Blackwood on lead vocals and guitar and composition again along with Henry Rogers of DeeExpus and Touchstone. Pete Trewavas co-wrote and produced the album with Eric Blackwood and played lead guitar and lead vocals on many of tracks along with bass and programming for the symphonic orchestration. Edison's Children is expecting their third album \"Somewhere Between Here and There\", a \"bridge album\" containing 7 new songs and 6 original mixes from The Final Breath Before November by King Crimson's Jakko Jakszyk and John Mitchell, along with the live version of A Million Miles Away from Wolves UK to be released in June 2015. Work has already begun on a 4th epic album which is expected to be much \"harder\" than the more symphonic The Final Breath Before November. On 17 September 2012, during a Marillion concert at The Junction in Cambridge, Steve Hogarth announced that Trewavas was now called \"Sweet Pea Tremendous\" as it was the result of putting his name into an anagram solver. Trewavas has also appeared in Prog Aid, the charity project set up to raise money for victims of the 2004 tsunami. Trewavas was a guest musician on English progressive rock band Big Big Train's 2007 album, The Difference Machine. Though primarily a bassist, Trewavas has been known to write keyboard parts during his time with Transatlantic, and has played acoustic guitar on Marillion songs, particularly \"Faith\" and \"Now She'll Never Know\". With Edison's Children however, Trewavas commonly plays lead guitar, lead vocals, symphonic orchestral programming, guitar synthesizer, drum programming and several middle-eastern instrumentation. Trewavas is a fan of the Football team Manchester United F.C."@en ;

In 2005, Sinfield was noted as a \"Prog rock hero\" in Q magazine, for his impressive lyrical contribution and creative influence while working within the rock music industry. As a lyricist, Sinfield has a distinctive approach to the sounds of words, filled with surreal imagery, and a special facility with water-images and ideas involving the sea. Later on in his career he adapted his writing for pop music, and co-wrote a succession of hits that were to be sung by artists such as Celine Dion, Cher, Cliff Richard, Leo Sayer, Five Star and Bucks Fizz."@en ;

He is known as the drummer and lead singer in the rock band Genesis and as a solo artist. Between 1983 and 1990, Collins scored three UK and seven US number-one singles in his solo career. When his work with Genesis, his work with other artists, as well as his solo career is totalled, Collins had more US top 40 singles than any other artist during the 1980s. His most successful singles from the period include \"In the Air Tonight\", \"Against All Odds\", \"Sussudio\" and \"Another Day in Paradise\". Born and raised in west London, Collins played drums from the age of five and completed drama school training, which secured him various roles as a child actor. He then pursued a music career, joining Genesis in 1970 as their drummer and becoming lead singer in 1975 following the departure of Peter Gabriel. Collins began a solo career in the 1980s, initially inspired by his marital breakdown and love of soul music, releasing a series of successful albums, including Face Value (1981), No Jacket Required (1985), and ...But Seriously (1989). Collins became \"one of the most successful pop and adult contemporary singers of the '80s and beyond\". He also became known for a distinctive gated reverb drum sound on many of his recordings. After leaving Genesis in 1996, Collins pursued various solo projects before a return in 2007 for the Turn It On Again Tour. In 2011, he retired to focus on his family life, but continued to write songs. He announced his return to the music industry in 2015. He will perform live for the first time in 10 years with a nine date European tour in July 2017, including a five night residency at the Royal Albert Hall in London. Collins' discography includes eight studio albums that have sold 33.5 million certified units in the US and an estimated 150 million worldwide, making him one of the world's best-selling artists. He is one of three recording artists, along with Paul McCartney and Michael Jackson, who have sold over 100 million albums worldwide both as solo artists and separately as principal members of a band. He has won seven Grammy Awards, six Brit Awards, two Golden Globe Awards, an Academy Award, and a Disney Legend Award. In 1999, he received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame and was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 2003, the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of Genesis in 2010, and the Modern Drummer Hall of Fame in 2012. Despite his commercial success and his status as a respected and influential drummer, music critics are divided in their opinion of his work and he has publicly received both  from other prominent music artists."@en ;

After releasing the commercially unsuccessful English-language album Precious under the stage name \"Cubic U\" in 1998, she rose to prominence in 1999 with the release of her second album, First Love, which sold over eight million copies in Japan and became the best selling Japanese-language album of all time. She formerly held the record for the highest first-week sales of an album in a single territory, as her Distance album sold over 3 million copies in Japan during the week of March 28, 2001. She has also had three of her Japanese studio albums in the list of Top 10 best-selling albums ever in Japan (number 1, 4, 8) and six of her albums (including one English-language and one compilation) charting within the 275 Best-Selling Japanese albums list. Utada has had twelve number-one singles on the Oricon Singles chart, with two notable record achievements for a female solo or group artist: five million-sellers and four in the Top 100 All-Time Best-selling Singles. It is estimated that Utada has sold more than 52 million records worldwide, making her one of the best-selling music artists in Japan. In 2009, she was considered \"the most influential artist of the decade\" in the Japanese landscape by The Japan Times. Additionally, Utada is best known in the West for making two theme song contributions to Square Enix and Disney's collaborative video game series Kingdom Hearts: \"Simple and Clean\" (which is the re-written English-language version of her 10th Japanese single \"Hikari\") for Kingdom Hearts and \"Sanctuary\" for Kingdom Hearts II (\"Passion\" in the Japanese version of the game)."@en .

Jean won three Grammy Awards for his musical work. On August 5, 2010, Jean filed for candidacy in the 2010 Haitian presidential election, although the Electoral Commission subsequently ruled him ineligible to stand as he had not met the requirement to have been resident in Haiti for five years. Jean's efforts at earthquake relief, highly publicized in 2010 throughout Haiti and the United States, were channeled through his charitable organization, Y\u00E9le Haiti. The charity, which performed a variety of charitable works in Haiti between 2005 and 2010, effectively closed in 2012 after much controversy over mismanagement of funds, with many believing that a large portion of the profits were not used for charitable purposes. Thus it has been claimed that much of the money raised by the organization in the Hope for Haiti Now telethon went to Jean's own benefit. Along with Carlos Santana, Avicii and Alexandre Pires, he was chosen to perform the closing ceremony at the 2014 FIFA World Cup in Brazil.

Yanni continues to use the musical shorthand that he developed as a child, blending jazz, classical, soft rock, and world music to create predominantly instrumental works. Although this genre of music was not well suited for commercial pop radio and music television, Yanni received international recognition by producing concerts at historic monuments and by producing videos that were broadcast on public television. His breakthrough concert, Live at the Acropolis, yielded the second best-selling music concert video of all time. Additional historic sites for Yanni's concerts have included India's Taj Mahal, China's Forbidden City, the United Arab Emirates' Burj Khalifa, Russia's Kremlin, Puerto Rico's El Morro castle, Lebanon's ancient city of Byblos, Tunisia's Roman Theatre of Carthage, India's Laxmi Vilas Palace, the Egyptian pyramids and Great Sphinx of Giza, and the Amman Citadel. At least sixteen of Yanni's albums have peaked at No. 1 in Billboard's \"Top New Age Album\" category, and two albums (Dare to Dream and In My Time) received Grammy Award nominations. Yanni has performed in more than 30 countries on five continents, and through late 2015 Yanni had performed live in concert before more than 5 million people and had accumulated more than 40 platinum and gold albums globally, with sales totaling over 25 million copies. A longtime fundraiser for public television, Yanni's compositions have been used on commercial television programs, especially for sporting events. He has written film scores and the music for an award-winning British Airways television commercial. Yanni popularized the combination of electronic music synthesizers with a full scale symphony orchestra. He has employed musicians of various nationalities and has incorporated a variety of exotic instruments to create music that has been called an eclectic fusion of ethnic sounds. Influenced by his encounters with cultures around the world, Yanni has been called a \"true global artist\" and his music is said to reflect his \u201Cone world, one people\u201D philosophy."@en ;

Upon graduation in 1992, he joined Square as a composer after seeing a magazine advertisement in an office he was visiting with his professor. Despite his job title as a composer, Mitsuda worked as a sound effects designer for two years. In 1994, after threatening to quit to Square's vice president, Hironobu Sakaguchi, he was assigned to compose the soundtrack to Chrono Trigger. After the game's success and the music's acclaim, he went on to compose several other games for Square, including Xenogears. In 1998, Mitsuda left Square to work as a freelance composer, founding his own music production studio, Procyon Studio, in 2001 as well as his own record label, Sleigh Bells.

Zeebra is a former member of the hip-hop group King Giddra, which also included DJ Oasis and K Dub Shine, and the older brother of fellow hip hop recording artist SPHERE of INFLUENCE. He went on to pursue a solo career shortly after in 1997, and signed with the Future Shock record label. Zeebra is one of the most popular rappers in Japan, and his popularity is not specific to either gender. He appears not only in hip-hop magazines, but also in fashion and street culture magazines. He often features in and produces other rappers' songs, and appears in their videos. He has also performed live with various rappers from America. In 1998 Zeebra undertook his first solo tour. He became recognized as an individual rapper for the first time, making hip-hop more familiar to Japanese listeners. In the same year he started the first hip-hop TV program in Japan, titled Beats to the Rhyme. One of Zeebra's songs was used in a Nike promotion video for NBA Japan games. The following year Zeebra released the single \"Mr. Dynamite\", the first hip-hop single to break into the top 50 on the Japanese pop charts. In June 2000, he released his new album Based on a True Story, which sold 250,000 copies. At the end of that year Zeebra started his first Japan tour, the first hip-hop event to sell out. In 2001 Zeebra released the single \"Never Enuff\", the theme song for a Japanese movie called Brother, directed by Takeshi Kitano and starring Claude Maki. In 2002 he temporarily rejoined King Giddra, but has been doing solo work since 2003 and has released many songs.

	dbo:abstract	"Anastacia Lyn Newkirk (born September 17, 1968) is an American singer-songwriter, producer and former dancer. She is best known for her eclectic pop music of the early 2000s which had a significant impact in Europe and Oceania. Her first two albums Not That Kind (2000) and Freak of Nature (2001) were released in quick succession to major success. Spurred on by the multi-platinum, global smash \"I'm Outta Love\", Anastacia was awarded as the 'World's Best-Selling New Female Pop Artist' in 2001. Her commercial appeal continued with international hits such as \"Paid My Dues\", \"One Day In Your Life\" and the official song of the 2002 FIFA World Cup, \"Boom\". After recovering from cancer, she returned with 2004's Anastacia which deviated from previous albums into pop-rock. Peaking at number one in 11 countries, it became Europe's second biggest selling album of the year. Its lead \"Left Outside Alone\" remained at number one on the European Billboard chart for 15 weeks and helped Anastacia launch the most successful European tour by a solo artist that same year. In 2005, the multi-platinum compilation project Pieces of a Dream was released which spawned the chart topping duet with Eros Ramazzotti, \"I Belong to You (Il Ritmo della Passione)\". Anastacia established herself as one of the top selling international female pop-singers of the 2000s before taking a hiatus in late 2006. She has sold over 52 million records worldwide  and has topped the U.S. dance chart on two separate occasions. In 2014, Anastacia made a comeback with her sixth studio album Resurrection, which reached the top ten in the Italian, Netherlands, Switzerland, German and the UK charts. Her Ultimate Collection was released in 2015 and peaked in the top ten of the UK charts, giving the singer her 6th top ten album in Britain. Known for her powerful mezzo-soprano voice and her small stature of 5 feet 2 inches (157 cm), she has been dubbed \"the little lady with the big voice\". Also famed for her trademark glasses; she underwent corrective lasic surgery in August 2005, although frequently still wears them. During her life Anastacia has battled many health problems. She was diagnosed with Crohn's disease at age 13, breast cancer at age 34 and supraventricular tachycardia, at age 39. In 2013 Anastacia was diagnosed with breast cancer for a second time. On October 1, 2013 to coincide with Breast Cancer Awareness Month, Anastacia informed the media that she had undergone a double mastectomy. In recognition of her decade-long charitable efforts in breast cancer awareness, Anastacia became only the second woman to be presented with the Humanitarian Award at the GQ Men of the Year Awards in 2013."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Brooke Ellen Bollea (born May 5, 1988), better known by her stage name Brooke Hogan, is an American reality television star, actress, singer, and media personality. She is the daughter of the famous professional wrestler Hulk Hogan. Brooke took an early interest in music, and began working on her first studio album in 2002. In an attempt to promote her music career, Hogan and her father appeared in a one-hour special on VH1. The special proved to be a ratings success, leading to Hogan and her family starring in the reality television series Hogan Knows Best (2005\u201307). The show saw a then teenage Brooke struggling with her overprotective father and recording her debut album. Her first studio album, Undiscovered, was released in 2006. It was preceded by the single \"About Us\", which entered the top-forty of the Billboard Hot 100 chart. While Hogan began working on her second album, personal struggles among her family led to the cancellation of Hogan Knows Best. This led to Hogan starring in her own television series, Brooke Knows Best (2008\u201309). Though her parents and brother made numerous appearances throughout the series, it mainly focused on Brooke and the recording of her new music. Hogan's second studio album, The Redemption (2009), failed to match the success of its predecessor. The album spawned two singles, neither of which had much success. Following the conclusion of Brooke Knows Best, Hogan pursued a career in acting, making numerous appearances in low budget films and television shows. In 2012, Hogan signed on to appear on Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA), alongside her father. She was released from the series after a year on the program. Hogan starred in the satire film L.A. Slasher (2015), and is working on a new extended play consisting of country music."@en ;

Alejandro S\u00E1nchez Pizarro (Spanish pronunciation: [ale\u02C8xand\u027Eo \u02C8san\u03B8]; better known as Alejandro Sanz; December 18, 1968) is a Spanish singer-songwriter and musician. For his work, Sanz has won a total of seventeen Latin Grammy Awards and three Grammy Awards. He has won the Latin Grammy for Album of the Year three times, more than any other artist. The singer is notable for his flamenco-influenced ballads, but he has also experimented with rock, funk, electronic, jazz and many genres from latin music. Born in Madrid to parents from Andalusia, Sanz began playing guitar at age seven, taking influence from his family's flamenco roots. Sanz released his debut album at age nineteen, although he did not gain commercial success in Spain until his second release, Viviendo Deprisa. His next two records, Si T\u00FA Me Miras (1993) and 3 (1995) also fared well commercially, but it was his 1997 breakthrough album M\u00E1s that garnered international success. El Alma al Aire followed in 2000, selling more than a million copies in its first week. In 2002, he became the first Spanish artist to record an MTV Unplugged album. His collaboration with Shakira on the 2005 single \"La Tortura\" reached number one on several charts worldwide. His albums No Es lo Mismo (2003) and El Tren de los Momentos (2006) showed Sanz experimenting with more diverse styles of music, while his 2009 release, Para\u00EDso Express served as a return to form for the musician. He signed to Universal Music Group in 2011 and released his tenth studio album, La M\u00FAsica No Se Toca, on September 25, 2012, followed by Sirope on May 4, 2015."@en ;
