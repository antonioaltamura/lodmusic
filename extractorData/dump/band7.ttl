	dbo:abstract	"Fear Factory is an American industrial metal band that was formed in 1989. During the band's career, they have released nine full-length albums and have evolved through a succession of styles, including nu metal, death metal, groove metal, and thrash metal. Fear Factory was enormously influential on the heavy metal scene in the mid-to-late 1990s. Fear Factory went on hold in March 2002 following some internal disputes, but reformed later that year without founding member Dino Cazares, adding bassist Byron Stroud, and previous bassist Christian Olde Wolbers as guitarist. In April 2009, a new lineup was announced. Cazares returned as lead and rhythm guitarist, and Gene Hoglan as drummer. Bell and Stroud reprised their respective roles, and the band completed a seventh studio album titled Mechanize. Former members Christian Olde Wolbers and Raymond Herrera\u2014both of whom were playing in Arkaea\u2014disputed the legitimacy of the new lineup, and a legal battle from both parties was begun. Fear Factory released its eighth studio album, The Industrialist, in June 2012. Their latest album, Genexus, was released in August 2015. Over the years, Fear Factory has seen changes in its members, with lead vocalist Burton C. Bell being the only consistent member since 1989. The band has performed at three Ozzfests and the inaugural Gigantour. Their singles have charted on the US Mainstream Rock Top 40 and albums on the Billboard Top 40, 100, and 200, and they have sold more than a million albums in the U.S. alone."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Fields of the Nephilim are an English gothic rock band formed in Stevenage, Hertfordshire, England in 1984. The original line-up consisted of vocalist Carl McCoy, saxophonist Gary Wisker, Tony Pettitt on bass, guitarist Paul Wright and drummer Alexander \"Nod\" Wright. After the release of the debut EP Burning the Fields, Wisker left the band to be replaced by Peter Yates as second guitarist to what is widely known as the 'classic' line-up. The current incarnation of the band has released one authorized recording of new material and one double live album since 1990, but the group perform frequently, with Carl McCoy and Tony Pettit remaining from the original lineup. The band's name refers to a Biblical race of giants or angel-human hybrids, known as the Nephilim. Although they have not received substantial mainstream success, the band's seminal sound has proved highly influential, especially in the genre of gothic rock."@en ;

	foaf:name	"Five Iron Frenzy"@en ;
	dbo:abstract	"Five Iron Frenzy (informally referred to as Five Iron or FIF) is a Christian ska punk band formed in Denver, Colorado in 1995. Five Iron Frenzy first gained notoriety spearheading the Christian ska movement during the genre's mainstream revival in the mid-1990s. The band developed a cult following among both Christian and secular audiences for their lively and energetic stage shows, which often featured the band performing in outlandish costumes or raising awareness of various social causes and charities. Five Iron Frenzy had sold almost one million units in total by the time they had initially disbanded in November 2003. Following an eight-year hiatus, the band announced a reunion in 2011, launching an accompanying Kickstarter campaign to help finance a new album which ultimately raised over $200,000, becoming the website's most successful musical project at the time. Their sixth and most recent studio album, Engine of a Million Plots, was released in November 2013. Musically, Five Iron Frenzy is largely influenced by ska and punk rock, occasionally incorporating such disparate styles as heavy metal and Latin music. Since 2000, the band began downplaying their ska influences in favor of alternative rock and pop punk, embracing a style which singer and lyricist Reese Roper has described as \"rock with horns\". Lyrically, Five Iron Frenzy is known for both their positive Christian messages rooted in Social Gospel convictions as well as humorous secular songs referencing popular culture. The band's recurring lyrical themes touch upon Christian hypocrisy, struggles with faith, criticism of consumerism and capitalism, the continuing injustices done to Native Americans, self-deprecating humor, and the joy of finding renewal in their Christian faith."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Fluke are an English electronic music group formed in the late 1980s by Mike Bryant, Jon Fugler and Mike Tournier with Julian Nugent as the band's manager. The band's conception was influenced by the members interest in the burgeoning acid house music scene and particularly the work of Cabaret Voltaire and Giorgio Moroder. The band are noted for their diverse range of electronic styles spanning the house, techno, ambient and blues genres; for their reclusivity, rarely giving interviews; and for lengthy timespans between albums. Many listeners know of Fluke only through the inclusion of their music in many blockbuster film soundtracks\u2014most notably The Matrix Reloaded and Sin City\u2014as well as featuring prominently on the soundtracks to Need for Speed: Underground and the Wipeout video game series. The film The Experiment uses their song \"YKK\". To date Fluke have produced five original studio albums, two \"best of\" compilations and two live albums. Throughout their career they have made several changes to their line-up with credited appearances attributed to Neil Davenport playing guitars, Robin Goodridge on drums and Hugh Bryder as a DJ. When Fluke were touring for Risotto they were joined on stage by Rachel Stewart who acted as a personification of the band's official mascot, a character from the Wipeout series named Arial Tetsuo. Stewart continued as lead female vocalist and as a dancer for all of Fluke's live performances between 1997 and 1999. After Risotto, Mike Tournier left the group to form Syntax with Jan Burton. Mike Bryant and Jon Fugler went on to produce Fluke's latest studio album without Tournier's help and the pair have subsequently engaged in projects under the name 2 Bit Pie, with their debut album 2Pie Island released on 4 September 2006. The musical activities of Mike Tournier remain unknown at present."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Franz Ferdinand are a Scottish rock band, formed in 2002 and based in Glasgow. The band's original lineup was composed of Alex Kapranos (lead vocals and guitar, keyboard), Nick McCarthy (rhythm guitar, keyboards and backing vocals), Bob Hardy (bass guitar), and Paul Thomson (drums, percussion and backing vocals). The band has been known for being one of the most popular post-punk revival bands, garnering multiple UK top 20 hits and selling over 3 million albums worldwide, as of late 2009. They have been nominated for several Grammy Awards and have received two Brit Awards\u2014winning one for Best British Group, as well as one NME Award. The band began by releasing their debut extended play, Darts of Pleasure, in 2003, under Domino Records. The band gained recognition in the United Kingdom after the EP's title track peaked at number 44 on UK Singles Chart. In January 2004, the band released the song \"Take Me Out\". The song went on to achieve global recognition, charting in several countries, and earned a Grammy nomination for Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal. It has since been noted as the band's signature song and has received critical acclaim from critics. The band subsequently released their eponymous debut studio album on 9 February 2004 to critical acclaim. The album won the 2004 Mercury Prize and earned a Grammy nomination for Best Alternative Album. In 2005, the band released their second studio album, You Could Have It So Much Better, which was produced by Rich Costey. The album went on to earn critical acclaim from critics as well as a positive commercial performance, peaking within the top-ten in multiple countries. The album earned a nomination for Best Alternative Album and one of the singles released from the album, \"Do You Want To\", earned a nomination for Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal at the 48th Annual Grammy Awards. The band's third studio album, Tonight: Franz Ferdinand, was announced in late 2008 and released in January 2009. The album was notable for featuring a change in the band's musical style, as the band had shifted from a post-punk-focused sound, which was featured on their first two albums, to a more dance-oriented sound. The album gained a positive commercial performance as well as positive reviews, but not as much acclaim as their first two albums. A remix album of Tonight, titled Blood, was subsequently released in July 2009. Four years after the release of Tonight, the band released their fourth studio album, Right Thoughts, Right Words, Right Action. In 2015, it was announced that Franz Ferdinand and American rock band Sparks had formed the supergroup FFS. The two released the album FFS in June 2015. In 2016, it was announced that Nick McCarthy had taken a break from the band to focus on family matters and other musical projects, but will be returning."@en ;

Members included Josephine Conigliaro (lead vocals), Matthieu LeChevalier (drums), and Josh Allen (lead guitar). The band officially formed in 2001 and officially ended in 2005 via their official website. They received their widest exposure after their song \"Somebody Help Me\" was chosen as the official theme song to the Fox Network's short-lived supernatural drama Tru Calling. Although they were never successful, Full Blown Rose subsequently developed a devoted fan base over the internet. Josh, Jessica, Matthieu, Pete, and Chepe all attended the Los Angeles Music Academy. Jessica and Chepe left due to creative differences shortly after the making of their first video in mid-2004. Jessica was replaced by Pete and Chepe was replaced by Mattieu. Though Josephine promised that Full Blown Rose would release one album, the band never officially released any of their material save for one song, \"In the Light,\" which was featured on the Wind-up Records soundtrack album to the film Elektra. They also contributed two songs to the soundtrack of the film Seed of Chucky, though an official soundtrack was never released. The vast majority of their work was only available to listen to on their website, and was never released as any form of downloadable content."@en ;

In 2003, the band announced an indefinite hiatus in order for band members to pursue other musical interests. In the intervening period, the group was occasionally rumored to have broken up, but the band finally reconvened for a tour beginning in late 2010. In October 2012, the band released its fourth album, 'Allelujah! Don't Bend! Ascend!. In March 2015, it released its fifth album, Asunder, Sweet and Other Distress.

	dbo:abstract	"Heavenly, a neo-classical metal and power metal band based in Marseille, France, was formed in 1993 in Paris by vocalist Benjamin Sotto and drummer Max Pilo, originally as a cover band under the name of Satan's Lawyer. In 1994, they changed their name to \"Heavenly\" and evolved into a full-fledged Helloween-influenced power metal outfit. In 1998, they released a three-track demo with new guitarist Anthony Parker. However, Parker's time with the band was to be short lived, leaving before a record deal with Noise Records was clinched. Heavenly then found a replacement in Chris Savourey and completed their lineup with bassist Laurent Jean. In 2000, Heavenly released their debut album Coming from the Sky. Although it was largely shunned by the media, the album proved a hit with metal fans and its success helped Heavenly land an appearance at the French Hard Rock Festival. With the arrival of a keyboardist, Fr\u00E9d\u00E9ric Leclercq, and the replacement of departed bassist Laurent Jean with Piere-Emmanuel Pelisson, Heavenly underwent another lineup change shortly before they supported Stratovarius on their 'Infinite' tour. Chris Savourey left soon afterwards, and Fr\u00E9d\u00E9ric Leclercq took on his role as the band's guitarist. Heavenly released their second album Sign of the Winner in 2001, and received positive feedback from both fans and media alike. For their following support slot on Edguy's European tour, Charley Corbiaux joined as a second guitarist, and has since become a permanent addition to Heavenly's ranks. After appearing at Wacken Open Air (the world's biggest metal festival) in 2002, Heavenly set to work recording their third album, Dust to Dust, which was eventually released in early 2004, further solidifying their status as one of France's premier power metal bands. In 2006, Heavenly released their fourth album, titled Virus. It is a departure from previous efforts, incorporating less double-bass drumming and expanding Sotto's vocal range. They opened for Scorpions during their 2007 French tour. In December 2009, they released their fifth album Carpe Diem."@en ;

To date, Idlewild have released seven full-length studio albums, with their latest, Everything Ever Written, released in February 2015. Initially, Idlewild's sound was faster and more dissonant than many of their 1990s indie rock contemporaries. However, it developed over time from an edgy and angular sound (as heard in their early material\u2014once described by the NME as \"the sound of a flight of stairs falling down a flight of stairs\") to a sweeping, melodic rock sound as displayed on The Remote Part and Warnings/Promises. While Idlewild's sound cannot be easily placed into a specific genre, they have clearly been influenced by the likes of: Gang of Four, Pavement, R.E.M., Blur and Fugazi. In 2010, the band entered an indefinite hiatus, but reunited in late 2013 to begin work on a new studio album."@en ;

The group is composed of Joseph Bruce and Joseph Utsler, who perform under the respective personas of the \"wicked clowns\" Violent J and Shaggy 2 Dope (originally 2 Dope). Insane Clown Posse performs a style of hardcore hip hop known as horrorcore and is known for its elaborate live performances. The duo has earned two platinum and five gold albums. According to Nielsen SoundScan, the entire catalog of the group has sold 6.5 million units in the United States and Canada as of April 2007. Originally known as JJ Boyz and Inner City Posse, the group introduced supernatural- and horror-themed lyrics as a means of distinguishing itself stylistically. The duo founded the independent record label Psychopathic Records with Alex Abbiss as manager, and produced and starred in the feature films Big Money Hustlas and Big Money Rustlas. They formed their own professional wrestling federation, Juggalo Championship Wrestling, and later collaborated with many well-known hip hop and rock musicians. The group has established a dedicated following called Juggalos numbering in the \"tens of thousands\". The songs of Insane Clown Posse center thematically on the mythology of the Dark Carnival, a metaphoric limbo in which the lives of the dead are judged by one of several entities. The Dark Carnival is elaborated through a series of stories called Joker's Cards, each of which offers a specific lesson designed to change the \"evil ways\" of listeners before \"the end consumes us all\". The original lineup of Insane Clown Posse was John Rode (Kid Villain), John Utsler (John Kickjazz), Joe Bruce (Violent J) & Joey Utsler (Shaggy 2 Dope). John Rode left after Dog Beats was released in 1991, and John Utsler left before Carnival of Carnage was released in 1992."@en ;

The band's discography has grown to thirty-eight albums, including sixteen studio albums, eleven live albums, four EPs, and seven compilations. Pioneers of the new wave of British heavy metal, Iron Maiden achieved initial success during the early 1980s. After several line-up changes, the band went on to release a series of UK and US platinum and gold albums, including 1982's The Number of the Beast, 1983's Piece of Mind, 1984's Powerslave, 1985's live release Live After Death, 1986's Somewhere in Time and 1988's Seventh Son of a Seventh Son. Since the return of lead vocalist Bruce Dickinson and guitarist Adrian Smith in 1999, the band have undergone a resurgence in popularity, with their 2010 studio offering, The Final Frontier, peaking at No. 1 in 28 countries and receiving widespread critical acclaim. Their sixteenth studio album, The Book of Souls, was released on 4 September 2015. Despite little radio or television support, Iron Maiden are considered one of the most successful heavy metal bands in history, with The Observer reporting in 2015 that the band have sold over 90 million copies of their albums worldwide. The band won the Ivor Novello Award for international achievement in 2002. As of October 2013, the band have played over 2000 live shows throughout their career. For the past 35 years, the band have been supported by their famous mascot, \"Eddie\", who has appeared on almost all of their album and single covers, as well as in their live shows."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Kiss (often styled as KISS) is an American rock band formed in New York City in January 1973 by Paul Stanley, Gene Simmons, Peter Criss and Ace Frehley. Well known for its members' face paint and stage outfits, the group rose to prominence in the mid-to-late 1970s with their elaborate live performances, which featured fire breathing, blood-spitting, smoking guitars, shooting rockets, levitating drum kits, and pyrotechnics. The band has gone through several lineup changes, with Stanley and Simmons the only remaining original members. The original and best-known lineup consisted of Stanley (lead vocals and rhythm guitar), Simmons (vocals and bass guitar), Ace Frehley (lead guitar and vocals) and Peter Criss (drums and vocals). With their make-up and costumes, they took on the personae of comic book-style characters: The Starchild (Stanley), The Demon (Simmons), The Spaceman or Space Ace (Frehley) and The Catman (Criss). Due to creative differences, both Criss and Frehley had departed the group by 1982. In 1983, Kiss began performing without makeup and costumes, thinking that it was time to leave the makeup behind. The band accordingly experienced a minor commercial resurgence, and their music videos received regular airplay on MTV. Drummer Eric Carr, who had replaced Criss in 1980, died in 1991 of a rare type of heart cancer and was replaced by Eric Singer. In response to a wave of Kiss nostalgia in the mid-1990s, the band announced a reunion of the original lineup in 1996, which also saw the return of their makeup and stage costumes. The resulting Alive/Worldwide Tour was commercially successful. Criss and Frehley have both since left the band again and have been replaced by Singer and Tommy Thayer, respectively. Kiss has sold more than 100 million records worldwide, including 25 million RIAA-certified albums. On April 10, 2014, Kiss was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame."@en ;

The current lineup of the band comprises Flynn, drummer Dave McClain, guitarist Phil Demmel, and bassist Jared MacEachern. Machine Head is one of the pioneering bands in the new wave of American heavy metal. Machine Head was formed by member Robb Flynn, previously part of the bands Forbidden and Vio-lence. Flynn felt musically unfulfilled with Vio-lence and requested to start a side project. When his request was denied, he left the band and formed Machine Head in 1991 with Adam Duce, Logan Mader and Tony Constanza. The band's first album Burn My Eyes, was a big success in Europe where it garnered attention on MTV's Headbangers Ball. In America (with HBB taken off the air during the grunge movement) Machine Head would not have success until later albums. The band nearly disbanded in 2002 after negotiating off its label Roadrunner Records, when controversy surrounding Machine Head's fourth album Supercharger (released 3 weeks after September 11, 2001) resulted in their songs and music video for the song \"Crashing Around You\" (which featured burning buildings) being pulled from all media outlets. The band re-signed with Roadrunner soon after and has released four albums since, 2003's Through the Ashes of Empires, 2007's The Blackening (which earned Machine Head its first Grammy Award nomination) and 2011's Unto the Locust. Their most recent album, Bloodstone & Diamonds, was released in 2014. Machine Head have sold over 3 million records worldwide."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Mayhem is a Norwegian black metal band formed in 1984 in Oslo, regarded as one of the pioneers of the Norwegian black metal scene. Mayhem's career has been highly controversial, primarily due to their violent stage performances, the 1991 suicide of vocalist Per Yngve Ohlin (\"Dead\") and the 1993 murder of guitarist \u00D8ystein Aarseth (\"Euronymous\") by former member Varg Vikernes (\"Count Grishnackh\"), of Burzum. The group released a demo and an EP that were highly influential, and amassed a loyal following through sporadic and notorious live performances, attracting further attention through their ties to the string of Norwegian church burnings and the prominent incidents of violence surrounding them. They disbanded after Aarseth's murder, shortly before the release of their debut album, De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas, regarded as a classic of the black metal genre. Surviving former members Jan Axel Blomberg (\"Hellhammer\"), J\u00F8rn Stubberud (\"Necrobutcher\") and Sven Erik Kristiansen (\"Maniac\") reformed two years later with Rune Eriksen (\"Blasphemer\") replacing Aarseth. Attila Csihar and (Morten Iversen) Teloch have since replaced Kristiansen and Eriksen, respectively. The band's music strongly influenced the black metal genre and was instrumental in moving the global black metal scene away from the prevailing trend for speed metal. Their post-Aarseth material is characterised by increased experimentation. The 2007 album, Ordo Ad Chao, received the Spellemannprisen award for best metal Album."@en ;

McFly's debut album Room on the 3rd Floor debuted at number 1 in the UK Album Chart and is certified as double platinum; this led to them becoming known as the youngest band ever to have an album debut at number one\u2014a title taken from The Beatles. A month after the album was released, the band had their first UK headlining tour. The band's second album, Wonderland, which was released in 2005, also charted at number 1 in the UK making them the youngest band to have topped the UK album charts twice. Their third album, Motion in the Ocean, was released on 6 November 2006 and charted at number 6 in the UK. McFly released their All the Greatest Hits compilation album on 5 November 2007, which charted at number 4 in the UK.

By 1990, in the Melbourne suburb of Moorabbin, they were renamed as Mortification with the line-up of Rowe, Michael Carlisle on guitar and Jayson Sherlock on drums. Mortification has released over twenty albums and several videos on major record labels such as Nuclear Blast. As one of the earliest internationally successful Christian death metal bands from Australia, they served as an inspiration for later similar groups. During the early 1990s Mortification played death metal, thrash, and grindcore, and \"belonged to the elite of the death metal movement,\" especially with their 1992 album Scrolls of the Megilloth. After the departure of Sherlock, Mortification began experimenting with groove metal, hardcore punk and power metal. They achieved commercial success with Blood World in 1994 and received critically acclaim for 1996's EnVision EvAngelene. Despite the lack of subsequent commercial success or mainstream critical recognition, \"the band, in spite of their extreme sound, are some kind of superstars in the 'White Metal' scene\", and have been described as \"a legend in the death metal scene.\" In late 1996, Rowe was diagnosed with acute lymphatic leukaemia and took 18 months to recover. Mortification issued their tenth album, Triumph of Mercy in August 1998 and accompanied it with a tour of North America. By August 1999, the band had sold a total of a quarter of a million albums across Europe and the US. They returned to their death/thrash roots for the 2004 album, Brain Cleaner."@en ;

Although their original line-up fell apart quickly, the band's first two albums\u2014New York Dolls (1973) and Too Much Too Soon (1974)\u2014became among the most popular cult records in rock. The line-up at this time comprised vocalist David Johansen, guitarist Johnny Thunders, bassist Arthur Kane, guitarist and pianist Sylvain Sylvain, and drummer Jerry Nolan; the latter two had replaced Rick Rivets and Billy Murcia, respectively, in 1972. On stage, they donned an androgynous wardrobe, wearing high heels, eccentric hats, and satin. Nolan described the group at the time as \"the Dead End Kids of today\". According to the Encyclopedia of Popular Music (1995), the New York Dolls predated the punk and glam metal movements, and were \"one of the most influential rock bands of the last 20 years\". They influenced rock groups such as the Sex Pistols, Kiss, the Ramones, Guns N' Roses, the Damned, and The Smiths, whose frontman Morrissey organized a reunion show for the New York Dolls' surviving members in 2004.

	dbo:abstract	"Nil (stylized as nil) is a Japanese rock band that was formed in 1998 by Tetsu Takano (ex-Malice Mizer, ex-Mega8Ball, ex-Zigzo, The JuneJulyAugust), Hiroyuki Kashimoto and Kyoshi Moro. The original intent of Nil was to become Tetsu's solo unit and even though it has become a full-fledged band, all lyrics and songwriting has been solely handled by Tetsu. The band only lasted briefly during its first incarnation and went on hiatus by the end of 1998. It would not resurface until the middle of 2002 when they would start recording again and Tetsu formed his own record label, Afro Skull Records. The name \"Nil\" literally means \"absolute zero\" and as an acronym refers to \"native irreligious language\". In 2005, Nil had many setbacks which resulted in the departure of founding members Kashimoto and Moro who both left the band on January 10, 2005, the last day of the \"Touring Inferno\" tour. Eventually replacement drummer Furuton (ex-Oblivion Dust, ex-Mega8Ball support) left the band after only 6 months. By the end of 2005 Nil finally settled down with the addition of Masaru Kobayashi (ex-Soy Sauce Sonix, ex-Sads, The Cro-Magnons) on bass and Kazama Hiroyuki (ex-Fantastic Designs) on drums. In the years since resuming activities, Nil has recorded and released 5 full albums, 7 mini albums, 1 cover album, 1 live album, 1 compilation album, 3 singles, 2 fan-club only CDs and 8 DVDs. Tetsu has claimed that Nil is his life's work and despite some bumps in the road he has showed no signs of slowing down with his music and the band Nil."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Petra is a music group regarded as a pioneer of the Christian rock and contemporary Christian music genres. Formed in 1972, the band took its name from the Greek word for \"rock\". Though they disbanded formally in 2006, incarnations of Petra have played reunion shows in the years since and released an album in November 2010. In 2013, the band returned from retirement with a new drummer Cristian Borneo and recorded a new song titled \"Holy is Your Name\", as well as going back on tour. With a style initially similar to The Eagles and Lynyrd Skynyrd, Petra's sound evolved into a more energetic, driving rock sound in the early 1980s akin to Foreigner, Styx and Journey. Throughout the 1980s and into the early 1990s, Petra was one of the world's most popular Christian rock bands, with each of its albums during that period selling hundreds of thousands of copies while the band sold out arenas and regularly placed songs at the top of Christian radio charts. With its lyrics, music and style, Petra influenced numerous other artists at a time when Christian rock experienced strong opposition from many conservative pastors and churches. In more than three decades, the band experienced numerous lineup changes yet released 20 studio albums, as well as three Spanish-language and two live albums, selling nearly 10 million copies while being nominated for 13 Grammy Awards, winning four, and winning 10 Dove Awards. Its biggest hit, \"The Coloring Song,\" reached the top position on three Christian radio charts simultaneously, and at its peak, the band's tours rivaled Amy Grant's in popularity among Christian audiences. Petra was the first rock band inducted into the Gospel Music Hall of Fame and the first Christian band whose memorabilia was included in the Hard Rock Cafe restaurant chain. The band announced its retirement in 2005, launching a farewell tour that was recorded for release on CD and DVD. Petra's 33-year career ended with a performance in the early hours of January 1, 2006, in Murphy, North Carolina. However, the band has continued to perform sporadically since then. In November 2010, an incarnation of the band's mid-1980s lineup surfaced under the name Classic Petra. They released a CD titled Back to the Rock featuring two new songs as well as re-recordings of hits from that era. The band released a companion live CD and DVD in 2011."@en ;

The band's debut album Scum, released in 1987 by Earache Records, proved substantially influential throughout the global metal community. According to the Guinness Book of World Records, their song \"You Suffer\" is the shortest song in the world, at only 1.316 seconds long.

Since 2011, Fluckey took over lead vocals.The lineup released an EP, Topple the Giants, in 2013, which also featured new guitarist Marc DeLeon. However, DeLeon left the band soon after with Ransom returning once again, solidifying the current line-up. This current line-up contains all the band's original members, excluding Chavez."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"The Buena Vista Social Club was a members' club in Havana, Cuba, that closed in the 1940s, as well as a 1990s band, a 1997 album, a 1999 film, and an unofficial brand name representing the musical spirit of the original Havana club. The original Buena Vista Social Club held dances and musical activities, becoming a popular location for musicians to meet and play during the 1940s. In the 1990s, nearly 50 years after the club was closed, it inspired a recording made by Cuban musician Juan de Marcos Gonz\u00E1lez and American guitarist Ry Cooder with traditional Cuban musicians, some of whom were veterans who had performed at the club during the height of its popularity. The recording, named Buena Vista Social Club after the Havana institution, became an international success, and the ensemble was encouraged to perform with a full line-up in Amsterdam in April 1998 (two nights). German director Wim Wenders captured the performance on film and the one that followed on the 1st of July 1998 in Carnegie Hall, New York City for a documentary\u2014also called Buena Vista Social Club\u2014that included interviews with the musicians conducted in Havana. Wenders' film was released on 4 June 1999 to critical acclaim, receiving an Academy Award nomination for Best Documentary feature and winning numerous accolades including Best Documentary at the European Film Awards. The success of both the album and film sparked a revival of international interest in traditional Cuban music and Latin American music in general. Some of the Cuban performers later released well-received solo albums and recorded collaborations with international stars from different musical genres. The \"Buena Vista Social Club\" name became an umbrella term to describe these performances and releases, and has been likened to a brand label that encapsulates Cuba's \"musical golden age\" between the 1930s and 1950s. The new success was fleeting for the most recognizable artists in the ensemble: Compay Segundo, Rub\u00E9n Gonz\u00E1lez, and Ibrahim Ferrer, who died at the ages of ninety-five, eighty-four, and seventy-eight respectively; Segundo and Gonz\u00E1lez in 2003, then Ferrer in 2005. Several surviving members of the Buena Vista Social Club, such as trumpeter Manuel \"Guajiro\" Mirabal, la\u00FAd player Barbarito Torres and trombonist and conductor Jesus \"Aguaje\" Ramos currently tour worldwide, to popular acclaim, with new members such as the singer Carlos Calunga, virtuoso pianist Rolando Luna and occasionally the solo singer Omara Portuondo, as part of a 13-member band called Orquesta Buena Vista Social Club."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Black Sabbath are an English rock band, formed in Birmingham in 1968, by guitarist and main songwriter Tony Iommi, bassist and main lyricist Geezer Butler, singer Ozzy Osbourne, and drummer Bill Ward. The band have since experienced multiple line-up changes, with guitarist Iommi being the only constant presence in the band through the years. Originally formed as a blues rock band, the group soon adopted the Black Sabbath moniker and began incorporating occult themes with horror-inspired lyrics and tuned-down guitars. Despite an association with these two themes, Black Sabbath also composed songs dealing with social instability, political corruption, the dangers of drug abuse and apocalyptic prophecies of the horrors of war. Osbourne's regular abuse of alcohol and other drugs led to his dismissal from the band in 1979. He was replaced by former Rainbow vocalist Ronnie James Dio. Following two albums with Dio, Black Sabbath endured countless personnel changes in the 1980s and 1990s that included vocalists Ian Gillan, Glenn Hughes, Ray Gillen and Tony Martin, as well as several drummers and bassists. In 1992, Iommi and Butler rejoined Dio and drummer Vinny Appice to record Dehumanizer. The original line-up reunited with Osbourne in 1997 and released a live album Reunion. Black Sabbath's 19th studio album, 13, which features all of the original members but Ward, was released in June 2013. Black Sabbath are often cited as pioneers of heavy metal music. The band helped define the genre with releases such as Black Sabbath (1970), Paranoid (1970) and Master of Reality (1971). They were ranked by MTV as the \"Greatest Metal Band\" of all time, and placed second in VH1's \"100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock\" list. Rolling Stone magazine ranked them number 85 in their \"100 Greatest Artists of All Time\". They have sold over 70 million records worldwide. Black Sabbath were inducted into the UK Music Hall of Fame in 2005 and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2006. They have also won two Grammy Awards for Best Metal Performance."@en ;

The founding members were New Zealander Neil Finn (vocalist, guitarist, primary songwriter) and Australians Paul Hester (drums) and Nick Seymour (bass). Later band members included Neil Finn's brother, Tim Finn, and Americans Mark Hart and Matt Sherrod. Originally active from 1985 to 1996, the band had consistent commercial and critical success in Australia and New Zealand and international chart success in two phases, beginning with their self-titled debut album, which reached number twelve on the US Album Chart in 1987 and provided the Top Ten hits \"Don't Dream It's Over\" and \"Something So Strong\". Further international success came in the UK, Europe and South Africa with their third and fourth albums, Woodface and Together Alone and the compilation album Recurring Dream, which included the hits \"Fall at Your Feet\", \"Weather with You\", \"Distant Sun\", \"Locked Out\", \"Instinct\" and \"Not the Girl You Think You Are\". Queen Elizabeth II bestowed an OBE on both Neil and Tim Finn, in June 1993, for their contribution to the music of New Zealand. Founding drummer Hester left in May 1994 citing family reasons, but briefly returned for their \"Farewell to the World\" concerts in Melbourne and Sydney in 1996. Neil Finn had decided to end the band to concentrate on his solo career and the Finn Brothers project with Tim. On 26 March 2005 Hester died by suicide, aged 46. In 2006 the group re-formed with new drummer Matt Sherrod and released two further albums (in 2007 and 2010), both of which reached number one on Australia's album chart.

The band has sold more than 100 million records worldwide, making them one of the best-selling bands of all time. In 1998, selected members of Fleetwood Mac were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, and received the Brit Award for Outstanding Contribution to Music. The two most successful periods for the band were during the late 1960s British blues boom, when they were led by guitarist Peter Green and achieved a UK number one with \"Albatross\"; and from 1975 to 1987, as a more pop-oriented act, featuring Christine McVie, Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks. Fleetwood Mac's second album after the incorporation of Buckingham and Nicks, 1977's Rumours, produced four U.S. Top 10 singles and remained at No. 1 on the American albums chart for 31 weeks, as well as reaching the top spot in various countries around the world. To date, the album has sold over 40 million copies worldwide, making it the eighth-highest-selling album of all time. The band achieved more modest success between 1971 and 1974, when the line-up included Bob Welch, during the 1990s in between the departure and return of Nicks and Buckingham, and during the 2000s when Christine McVie was absent. Due to numerous lineup changes, the only original member present in the band is drummer Mick Fleetwood. Although band founder Green named the group by combining the surnames of two of his former bandmates (Fleetwood and McVie) from John Mayall's Bluesbreakers, bassist John McVie played neither on their first single nor at their first concerts, as he initially decided to stay with Mayall. Keyboardist Christine McVie, who joined the band in 1970 while married to John McVie, has appeared on every album except the debut album, either as a member or as a session musician. She left the band in 1998 but returned in 2014."@en ;

The group's name is a reference to the H.G. Wells novel The Island of Dr. Moreau, a reference carried further by the naming of their 2011 tour \"He Who Breaks the Law\". The group is best known for its 1992 hit single \"Jump Around\", which reached No. 3 in their native United States, No. 6 in Ireland and No. 8 in the United Kingdom. The group broke up in 1996 but reformed in 2010, after the trio had been members of supergroup La Coka Nostra for several years."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"King Crimson are an English rock band formed in London in 1968. The band has undergone numerous  throughout its history of which 21 musicians have been members; since 2016 it has consisted of Robert Fripp, Jakko Jakszyk, Tony Levin, Mel Collins, Pat Mastelotto, Gavin Harrison and Jeremy Stacey. Fripp is the only consistent member of the group, and is considered the band's leader and driving force. The band has earned a large cult following. Developed from the unsuccessful trio Giles, Giles and Fripp, the band was seminal in the progressive rock genre in its first five years with its standard of instrumentation and complex song structures. King Crimson's debut album, In the Court of the Crimson King (1969), remains its most successful and influential, with its elements of jazz, classical, and experimental music. Their success increased following an opening act performance for The Rolling Stones at Hyde Park, London, in 1969. Following the less successful In the Wake of Poseidon (1970), Lizard (1970), and Islands (1971), the group reached a new creative peak with Larks' Tongues in Aspic (1973), Starless and Bible Black (1974), and Red (1974). Fripp disbanded the group in 1974. In 1981, King Crimson reformed with a change in musical direction which lasted for three years, resulting in the trio of albums Discipline (1981), Beat (1982), and Three of a Perfect Pair (1984). Following a decade-long hiatus, Fripp revived the group in 1994 and released Thrak (1995). Since 1997, several musicians have pursued aspects of the band's work and approaches through a series of related bands collectively referred to as ProjeKCts. In 2000, the band reunited once more and released the construKction of light (2000). The band's most recent album is The Power to Believe (2003). In 2009 the band undertook a tour to celebrate their 40th Anniversary and continue to perform live in various capacities. King Crimson has been influential to several other musical artists."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Brotherhood of Man are a British pop group who achieved success in the 1970s. They won the 1976 Eurovision Song Contest with \"Save Your Kisses for Me\". Created in 1969 by songwriter and record producer Tony Hiller, Brotherhood of Man was initially an umbrella title for a frequently-changing line-up of session singers. Early on, they scored a worldwide hit with the song \"United We Stand\". By 1973 the concept had run its course and Hiller formed a definite four-member line-up consisting of Martin Lee, Lee Sheriden, Nicky Stevens and Sandra Stevens. This version of the group went on to score many hits around the world in the mid to late 1970s including \"Kiss Me Kiss Your Baby\", \"Angelo\", \"Oh Boy (The Mood I'm In)\" and \"Figaro\". They achieved perhaps their biggest success in their native UK with three number one singles and four top twenty albums. The group under this line-up still continues today, performing shows throughout Europe. Altogether, they have released 16 studio albums, with worldwide record sales topping 15 million."@en ;
