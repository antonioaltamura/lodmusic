	dbo:abstract	"Alice in Chains is an American rock band formed in Seattle, Washington, in 1987 by guitarist and songwriter Jerry Cantrell and original lead vocalist Layne Staley. The initial lineup was rounded out by drummer Sean Kinney and bassist Mike Starr, who was replaced in 1993 by Mike Inez. Although widely associated with grunge music, the band's sound incorporates heavy metal elements. Since its formation, Alice in Chains has released five studio albums, three EPs, two live albums, four compilations, and two DVDs. The band is known for its distinctive vocal style, which often included the harmonized vocals of Staley and Cantrell (and later William DuVall). Alice in Chains rose to international fame as part of the grunge movement of the early 1990s, along with other Seattle bands such as Nirvana, Pearl Jam, and Soundgarden. The band was one of the most successful music acts of the 1990s, selling over 20 million records worldwide, and over 14 million records in the US alone. In 1992 the band's second album, Dirt, was released to critical acclaim and was certified quadruple platinum. Their third album, Alice in Chains, was released in 1995 and has been certified double platinum. It achieved No. 1 position on the Billboard 200 chart. The band has had 14 top ten songs on the Mainstream Rock Tracks chart and nine Grammy Award nominations. Although never officially disbanding, Alice in Chains was plagued by extended inactivity from 1996 onwards due to Staley's substance abuse, which resulted in his death in 2002. The band reunited in 2005 for a live benefit show, performing with a number of guest vocalists. They toured in 2006, with William DuVall taking over as lead vocalist full-time. The new line-up released the band's fourth studio album, Black Gives Way to Blue, in 2009. The album received gold certification by the RIAA. In 2013, the band released The Devil Put Dinosaurs Here, its fifth studio album. The band has toured extensively and released several videos in support of these albums. Alice in Chains is currently working on their sixth studio album."@en ;

The group consisted of Peter Murphy (vocals, occasional instruments), Daniel Ash (guitar), Kevin Haskins (drums) and David J (bass). The band was originally named Bauhaus 1919 in reference to the first operating year of the art school Bauhaus, although they shortened the name within a year of formation. Generally considered one of the first gothic rock groups, Bauhaus were known for their gloomy sound and dark image. However, musically the band was quite diverse. Throughout their career, they incorporated a variety of genres, ranging from reggae to funk. Bauhaus broke up in 1983. Peter Murphy began a solo career while Ash and Haskins continued as Tones on Tail and, later, reunited with David J to form Love and Rockets. Both enjoyed greater commercial success in the United States than Bauhaus had, but disappeared from the charts in their homeland. Bauhaus eventually reunited for a 1998 tour and again from 2005 to 2008."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Bill Haley & His Comets were an American rock and roll band, founded in 1952 and continued until Haley's death in 1981. The band, also known as Bill Haley and the Comets and Bill Haley's Comets (and variations thereof), was the earliest group of white musicians to bring rock and roll to the attention of America and the rest of the world. From late 1954 to late 1956, the group placed nine singles in the Top 20, one of those a number one and three more in the Top Ten. Bandleader Bill Haley had previously been a country music performer; after recording a country and western-styled version of \"Rocket 88\", a rhythm and blues song, he changed musical direction to a new sound which came to be called rock and roll. Although several members of the Comets became famous, Bill Haley remained the star. With his spit curl and the band's matching plaid dinner jackets and energetic stage behavior, many fans consider them to be as revolutionary in their time as the Beatles or the Rolling Stones were a decade later. Following Haley's death, no fewer than seven different groups have existed under the Comets name, all claiming (with varying degrees of authority) to be the continuation of Haley's group. As of the end of 2014, four such groups were still performing in the United States and internationally."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Buzzcocks are an English punk rock band, formed in Bolton, England in 1976 by singer-songwriter-guitarist Pete Shelley and singer-songwriter Howard Devoto. They are regarded as an important influence on the Manchester music scene, the independent record label movement, punk rock, power pop, and indie rock. They achieved commercial success with singles that fused pop craftsmanship with rapid-fire punk energy. These singles were collected on Singles Going Steady, described by critic Ned Raggett as a \"punk masterpiece\". Devoto and Shelley chose the name \"Buzzcocks\" after reading the headline, \"It's the Buzz, Cock!\", in a review of the TV series Rock Follies in Time Out magazine. The \"buzz\" is the excitement of playing on stage; \"cock\" is Manchester slang meaning \"mate\" (as in friend/buddy). They thought it captured the excitement of the Sex Pistols and nascent punk scene. Devoto left the band in 1977, after which Pete Shelley became the principal singer-songwriter."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Cream were a 1960s British rock supergroup power trio consisting of bassist/singer Jack Bruce, drummer Ginger Baker, and guitarist/singer Eric Clapton. The group's third album, Wheels of Fire (1968), was the world's first platinum-selling double album. The band is widely regarded as the world's first successful supergroup. In their career, they sold more than 15 million copies of their albums worldwide. Their music included songs based on traditional blues such as \"Crossroads\" and \"Spoonful\", and modern blues such as \"Born Under a Bad Sign\", as well as more eccentric songs such as \"Strange Brew\", \"Tales of Brave Ulysses\" and \"Toad\". The band's biggest hits are \"I Feel Free\" (UK, number 11), \"Sunshine of Your Love\" (US, number 5), \"White Room\" (US, number 6), \"Crossroads\" (US, number 28), and \"Badge\" (UK, number 18). The band made a significant impact on the popular music of the time, and, along with Jimi Hendrix and other notable guitarists and bands, popularised the use of the wah-wah pedal. They provided a heavy yet technically proficient musical theme that foreshadowed and influenced the emergence of British bands such as Led Zeppelin, The Jeff Beck Group, Deep Purple and Black Sabbath in the late 1960s and the early 1970s. The band's live performances influenced progressive rock acts such as Rush. The band was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1993. They were included in both Rolling Stone and VH1's lists of the \"100 Greatest Artists of All Time,\" at number 67 and 61 respectively. They were also ranked number 16 on VH1's \"100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock\"."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Deep Purple are an English rock band formed in Hertford in 1968. They are considered to be among the pioneers of heavy metal and modern hard rock, although their musical approach changed over the years. Originally formed as a progressive rock band, the band shifted to a heavier sound in 1970. Deep Purple, together with Led Zeppelin and Black Sabbath, have been referred to as the \"unholy trinity of British hard rock and heavy metal in the early to mid-seventies\". They were listed in the 1975 Guinness Book of World Records as \"the globe's loudest band\" for a 1972 concert at London's Rainbow Theatre, and have sold over 100 million albums worldwide. Deep Purple have had several line-up changes and an eight-year hiatus (1976\u20131984). The 1968\u20131976 line-ups are commonly labelled Mark I, II, III and IV. Their second and most commercially successful line-up featured Ian Gillan (vocals), Jon Lord (organ), Roger Glover (bass), Ian Paice (drums), and Ritchie Blackmore (guitar). This line-up was active from 1969 to 1973, and was revived from 1984 to 1989, and again from 1992 to 1993. The band achieved more modest success in the intervening periods between 1968 and 1969 with the line-up including Rod Evans (vocals) and Nick Simper (bass, backing vocals), between 1974 and 1976 (Tommy Bolin replacing Blackmore in 1975) with the line-up including David Coverdale (vocals) and Glenn Hughes (bass, vocals), and between 1989 and 1992 with the line-up including Joe Lynn Turner (vocals). The band's line-up (currently featuring Ian Gillan, and guitarist Steve Morse from 1994) has been much more stable in recent years, although organist Jon Lord's retirement from the band in 2002 (being succeeded by Don Airey) left Ian Paice as the only original Deep Purple member still in the band. Deep Purple were ranked number 22 on VH1's Greatest Artists of Hard Rock programme and a poll on British radio station Planet Rock ranked them 5th among the \"most influential bands ever\". The band received the Legend Award at the 2008 World Music Awards. Having been nominated for the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2012 and 2013 but failing to get enough votes for induction, Deep Purple were finally announced as inductees into the Hall of Fame in December 2015. They were officially inducted on 8 April 2016."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Genesis are an English rock band formed at Charterhouse School, Godalming, Surrey in 1967. The most commercially successful and long-lasting line-up includes keyboardist Tony Banks, bassist/guitarist Mike Rutherford and drummer/singer Phil Collins. Other important members were the original lead singer Peter Gabriel and guitarist Steve Hackett. The band underwent many changes in musical style over its career, from folk music to progressive rock in the 1970s, before moving towards pop at the end of the decade. They have sold 21.5 million RIAA-certified albums in the US and their worldwide sales are estimated to be between 100 million and 150 million. Formed by five Charterhouse pupils including Banks, Rutherford, Gabriel, and Anthony Phillips, Genesis was named by former pupil Jonathan King who arranged them to record several unsuccessful singles and an album. After splitting with King, the group began touring professionally, signing with Charisma Records. Following the departure of Phillips, Genesis recruited Collins and Hackett and recorded several progressive rock style albums, with live shows centred around Gabriel's theatrical costumes and performances. The group were initially commercially successful in Europe, before entering the UK charts with Foxtrot (1972). They followed this with Selling England by the Pound (1973) and The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway (1974) before Gabriel decided to leave the group. After an unsuccessful search for a replacement, Collins took over as lead singer, while the group gained popularity in the UK and the US. Following A Trick of the Tail and Wind & Wuthering (both 1976), Hackett left the band, reducing it to a core of Banks, Rutherford, and Collins. Genesis had their first UK top ten and US top 30 single in 1978 with \"Follow You Follow Me\" and the group continued to gain commercial success with Duke (1980), Abacab (1981), and Genesis (1983), reaching a peak with Invisible Touch (1986), which featured five US top five singles. Its title track reached number one in the US. After the follow up, We Can't Dance (1991) and related tour, Collins left Genesis in 1996 to focus on his solo career. Banks and Rutherford recruited Ray Wilson for Calling All Stations (1997), but a lack of success in the US led to a group hiatus. Banks, Rutherford and Collins reunited for the Turn It On Again Tour in 2007, and together with Gabriel and Hackett were interviewed for the BBC documentary Genesis: Together and Apart in 2014. Their discography includes fifteen studio and six live albums, six of which topped the UK chart. They have won numerous awards and nominations, including a Grammy Award for Best Concept Music Video with \"Land of Confusion\", and inspired a number of tribute bands recreating Genesis shows from various stages of the band's career. In 2010, Genesis were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame."@en ;

For much of the group's career, the band has been a trio with drummer Tr\u00E9 Cool, who replaced former drummer John Kiffmeyer in 1990 prior to the recording of the band's second studio album, Kerplunk (1992). In 2012, guitarist Jason White became an official member after having performed with the band as a touring member since 1999. Green Day was originally part of the punk scene at the DIY 924 Gilman Street club in Berkeley, California. The band's early releases were with the independent record label Lookout! Records. In 1994, its major label debut Dookie (released through Reprise Records) became a breakout success and eventually shipped over 10 million copies in the U.S. Green Day was widely credited, alongside fellow California punk bands Sublime, Bad Religion, The Offspring, Blink-182, and Rancid, with popularizing and reviving mainstream interest in punk rock in the United States. Green Day's three follow-up albums, Insomniac (1995), Nimrod (1997), and Warning (2000) did not achieve the massive success of Dookie, though they were still successful, with Insomniac and Nimrod reaching double platinum and Warning achieving platinum status. The band's rock opera, American Idiot (2004), reignited the band's popularity with a younger generation, selling six million copies in the U.S. The band's eighth studio album, 21st Century Breakdown, was released in 2009 and achieved the band's best chart performance to date. 21st Century Breakdown was followed up by a trilogy of albums called \u00A1Uno!, \u00A1Dos!, and \u00A1Tr\u00E9!, which were released in September, November and December 2012 respectively. The band's twelfth studio album, Revolution Radio was released on October 7, 2016. Green Day has sold more than 75 million records worldwide. The group has won five Grammy Awards: Best Alternative Album for Dookie, Best Rock Album for American Idiot, Record of the Year for \"Boulevard of Broken Dreams\", Best Rock Album for the second time for 21st Century Breakdown and Best Musical Show Album for American Idiot: The Original Broadway Cast Recording. In 2010, a stage adaptation of American Idiot debuted on Broadway. The musical was nominated for three Tony Awards: Best Musical, Best Scenic Design and Best Lighting Design, losing only the first. Also in 2010, Green Day was ranked no. 91 in the VH1 list of the \"100 Greatest Artists of All Time\". On April 18, 2015, the band was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a part of the 2015 class, in the band's first year of eligibility."@en ;

Formed in 1980, the group is known for lyrics based on fantasy (particularly sword and sorcery) and mythology (particularly Norse mythology). The band is also known for a loud and bombastic sound. In an interview for MTV in February 2007, bassist Joey DeMaio lamented that \"these days, there's a real lack of big, epic metal that is drenched with crushing guitars and choirs and orchestras... so it's nice to be one of the few bands that's actually doing that.\" In 1984 the band was included in the Guinness Book of World Records for delivering the loudest performance, a record which they have since broken on 2 occasions. They also hold the world record for the longest heavy metal concert after playing for 5 hours and 1 minute in Bulgaria (at Kavarna Rock Fest) in 2008. They also have been known for their slogan \"Death to false metal\". Although the band has never been a mainstream commercial success in the United States, they maintain a strong cult following there. In contrast, they are extremely popular in the heavy metal scene in Europe and South America. Dedicated fans are known and referred to by the band as \"Metal Warriors\", \"Manowarriors\", \"Immortals\" or \"Brothers of Metal\"."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Marillion /m\u0259\u02C8r\u026Alj\u0259n/ are a British rock band, formed in Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, England, in 1979. They emerged from the post-punk music scene in Britain and are credited with creating a bridge between the styles of punk rock and classic progressive rock, becoming the most commercially successful neo-progressive rock band of the 1980s. They have sold more than 15 million albums. Marillion's recorded studio output since 1982 is composed of eighteen albums, generally regarded in two distinct eras, delineated by the departure of original frontman Fish in late 1988, and the subsequent arrival of replacement Steve Hogarth in early 1989. The band achieved eight Top Ten UK albums between 1983 and 1994, including a number one album in 1985 with Misplaced Childhood, and during the period the band were fronted by Fish they scored eleven Top 40 hits on the UK Singles Chart. They are best known for the 1985 singles \"Kayleigh\" and \"Lavender\", which reached number two and number five respectively. The first album released with Hogarth, 1989's Seasons End, was another Top Ten hit, and albums continued to chart well until their departure from EMI following the release of their 1996 live album Made Again and the dissipation of the band's mainstream popularity in the late 1990s; save for a resurgence in the mid- to late-2000s, they have essentially been a cult act since then. Marillion have achieved a further twelve Top 40 hit singles in the UK with Hogarth, including 2004's \"You're Gone\", which charted at No. 7 and is the biggest hit of his tenure. The band continue to tour internationally, and were ranked 38th in Classic Rock's \"50 Best Live Acts of All Time\" in 2008. Marillion are widely considered to have been one of the first mainstream acts to have fully recognised and tapped the potential for commercial musicians to interact with their fans via the internet, starting in around 1996, and are nowadays often characterised as a rock & roll 'Web Cottage Industry'. The history of the band's use of the Internet is described by Michael Lewis in the book Next: The Future Just Happened as an example of how the Internet is shifting power away from established elites, such as multinational record labels and record producers. The band are renowned for having an extremely dedicated following (often self-termed 'Freaks'), with some fans regularly travelling significant distances to attend single gigs, driven in large part by the close fan base involvement which the band cultivate via their website, podcasts, biennial conventions and regular fanclub publications. The release of their 2001 album Anoraknophobia, which was funded by their fans through advance orders instead of by the band signing to a record company, gained significant attention and was called \"a unique funding campaign\" by the BBC. Writing for The Guardian, Alexis Petridis described Marillion as \"the undisputed pioneers\" of fan-funded music."@en ;

NOFX has released twelve studio albums, fifteen extended plays and a number of seven-inch singles. Their latest studio album, First Ditch Effort, was released on October 7, 2016.

Opeth has consistently incorporated progressive, folk, blues, classical and jazz influences into its usually lengthy compositions, as well as strong influences from death metal, especially in their early works. Many songs include acoustic guitar passages and strong dynamic shifts, as well as both death growls and clean vocals. Opeth is also well known for their incorporation of Mellotrons in their work. Opeth rarely made live appearances supporting their first four albums; but since conducting their first world tour after the 2001 release of Blackwater Park, they have led several major world tours. Opeth has released twelve studio albums, three live DVDs, three live albums (two that are in conjunction with DVDs), and two boxsets. The band released its debut album Orchid in 1995. Although their eighth studio album, Ghost Reveries, was quite popular in the United States, Opeth did not experience major American commercial success until the 2008 release of their ninth studio album, Watershed, which peaked at No. 23 on the Billboard 200, and topped the Finnish albums chart in its first week of release. Opeth has sold over 1.5 million albums and DVDs worldwide, including 300,000 collective SoundScans of their albums Blackwater Park, Damnation and Deliverance in the United States."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Blink-182 (often stylized as blink-182) is an American rock band formed in Poway, California in 1992. The band currently consists of bassist and vocalist Mark Hoppus, drummer Travis Barker, and guitarist and vocalist Matt Skiba. Founded by Hoppus, guitarist and vocalist Tom DeLonge, and drummer Scott Raynor, the band emerged from the Southern California punk scene of the early 1990s and first gained notoriety for high-energy live shows and irreverent lyrical toilet humor. Blink-182 was initially known as Blink until an Irish band of the same name threatened legal action; the band appended the meaningless number \"-182\". In its early years, Blink-182 toured heavily behind the band's debut, Cheshire Cat (1995). The group signed with major label MCA Records to co-distribute its second album, Dude Ranch (1997). Raynor was fired midway through a 1998 tour and replaced by Barker. The group's next two releases, Enema of the State (1999) and Take Off Your Pants and Jacket (2001), were enormous successes on the strength of radio and MTV airplay. The eponymously titled Blink-182 followed in 2003 and marked a stylistic shift for the group. DeLonge quit in 2005, sending the band into what was termed an \"indefinite hiatus\". They reunited in 2009, producing the trio's sixth album, Neighborhoods (2011). In 2015, DeLonge again exited and was replaced by Alkaline Trio guitarist and vocalist Matt Skiba. The band's seventh studio album, California, was released on July 1, 2016. Blink-182 is considered a key group in the development of pop punk; the band's combination of pop melodies with fast-paced punk rock featured a more radio-friendly accessibility than prior bands. The trio has sold over thirteen million albums in the United States, and over 35 million albums worldwide. In 2011, The New York Times asserted, \"no punk band of the 1990s has been more influential than Blink-182,\" and even as the band receded after its 2005 split, \"its sound and style could be heard in the muscular pop punk of Fall Out Boy or in the current wave of high-gloss Warped Tour punk bands, like All Time Low and The Maine.\""@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"(This article is about the musical group. For other uses, see 2NE1 (disambiguation).) 2NE1 (Korean: \uD22C\uC560\uB2C8\uC6D0, IPA: [t\u02B0u.\u025B.ni.w\u028Cn]) is a South Korean girl group formed by YG Entertainment in 2009. The group currently consists of CL, Bom, and Dara. The fourth and the youngest member, Minzy, officially left the group on April 5, 2016. First appearing in \"Lollipop\", a commercial campaign with Big Bang for LG Electronics, 2NE1's debut single \"Fire\" was released on May 6, 2009. Since then, the group has released two eponymous extended plays, 2NE1 (2009) and 2NE1 (2011), and two studio albums, To Anyone and Crush. Their first EP spawned the number-one single \"I Don't Care\", which won them the \"Song of the Year\" award at the 2009 Mnet Asian Music Awards. Their follow-up singles, such as \"Go Away\", \"Lonely\" and \"I Am the Best\", were similarly successful, with \"I Am the Best\" winning 2NE1 their second \"Song of the Year\" award in 2011. 2NE1 officially debuted in Japan in September 2011 with a Japanese version of their second EP, titled Nolza. Since then, the group has released one studio album, Collection, and two physical singles in Japan. In 2012, The New York Times named 2NE1's performance at the Prudential Center in New Jersey as one of the \"Best Concerts of 2012\". In October 2012, Zack Greenburg of Forbes magazine noted that 2NE1 has sold 27 million digital downloads."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Box Car Racer was an American rock band formed in San Diego, California in 2001. The group consisted of guitarist and vocalist Tom DeLonge and drummer Travis Barker of Blink-182, alongside guitarist David Kennedy of Hazen Street. Anthony Celestino later joined the ensemble as a bassist. DeLonge created the project to pursue darker ideas he felt unsuited to his work with Blink-182. He invited Barker in order to refrain from paying a studio drummer, and fellow guitarist David Kennedy, whom DeLonge had met in the San Diego music circuit years prior. Jeff Russell from Signals Midwest was also invited to join the band but declined. Box Car Racer was partly inspired and viewed as a tribute to Jawbox, Quicksand, Fugazi and Refused. The group recorded the band's eponymous debut, Box Car Racer, in quick fashion with a more DIY spirit. MCA Records issued the band's lone release in May 2002, which peaked on the Billboard 200 at number 12. Singles \"I Feel So\" and \"There Is\" also charted on the Modern Rock Tracks chart, with the former shooting to number eight. The band embarked on their sole headlining tour across North America in the fall of 2002 with supporting act The Used. Box Car Racer created unresolved tension within Blink-182 and inevitably influenced the band's following studio album, the more experimental Blink-182 (2003). DeLonge ended the project in mid-2003, considering it to have served its purpose; however, DeLonge's later band, Angels & Airwaves (which also featured Kennedy) has been described by DeLonge as a continuation of Box Car Racer."@en ;

Whitefinger's albums have been favourably reviewed by some magazines and websites, and in reviews Whitefinger has been compared to Bob Dylan, Paul Heaton, Raymond Chandler, and The Zutons. Some of Whitefinger's recordings (Drunk For A Penny Dead For A Pound, Rockets Of Persistence) were engineered by Spiritualized / Julian Cope guitarist Tony 'Doggen' Foster. Curtis often plays live with The Curtis Whitefinger Ordeal - a four-piece band currently featuring bass player John Russell, guitarist Dave Pearce and drummer Nick Brown. Past members of the band included drummer Antony Hodgkinson, formerly of Bivouac, Punish The Atom, and Dogntank, who also danced on stage for Nirvana; he now plays with Julian Cope.

Unruh (custom-made instruments, percussion, vocals), Jochen Arbeit (guitar and vocals), and Rudolf Moser (custom-built instruments, percussion, and vocals). One of their trademarks is the use of custom-built instruments, predominantly made out of scrap metal and building tools, and noises, in addition to standard musical instruments. Their early albums were unremittingly harsh, with Bargeld's vocals shouted and screamed above a din of banging and scraping metal percussion. Subsequent recordings found the group's sound growing somewhat more conventional, yet still containing many unorthodox elements."@en ;

After heavily publicized legal battles with their former manager Lou Pearlman and former record label Bertelsmann Music Group, the group's second album, No Strings Attached, sold over one million copies in one day and 2.42 million copies in one week, which was a record for over fifteen years. In addition to a host of Grammy Award nominations, NSYNC has performed at the World Series, the Super Bowl and the Olympic Games, and sang or recorded with Elton John, Stevie Wonder, Michael Jackson, Phil Collins, Celine Dion, Aerosmith, Britney Spears, Nelly, Left Eye, Mary J. Blige, country music supergroup Alabama, and Gloria Estefan. Although NSYNC announced the start of a \"temporary hiatus\" in spring 2002, the band has not recorded new material since then. In 2007, Lance Bass confirmed that the group had \"definitely broken up.\" They have sold over 50 million albums during their career, becoming the eighth-best-selling boy band in history. Rolling Stone recognized their instant success as one of the Top 25 Teen Idol Breakout Moments of all time."@en ;

With the album The Face (2001) and the songs \"She\u2019s A Freak\", \"Bullet\", \"Blazin\", and \"Enter The Dragon\" they established a characteristic style: a G-funk base with a blend of heavy guitars, rapping, singing, and unusual samplings. In 2004 they had a Swedish hit with the song \"No. 1 Swartskalle\" (Svartskalle is a traditionally derogatory Swedish slang term for immigrants that are non-blonde and non-Nordic looking.)

	foaf:name	"Kryst the Conqueror"@en ;
	dbo:abstract	"Kryst the Conqueror (Pronounced \"Christ the Conqueror\") was an American Christian metal project formed in August of 1987 by two former members of the horror punk band, The Misfits. The project was led by bassist Jerry Only, who adopted a new stage name, \"Mo The Great\" (or alternately, \"Mocavious Kryst\"), and his younger brother, guitarist Doyle Wolfgang von Frankenstein. The band fused fantastical and sci-fi imagery with religious themes and messages. The band has also been referred to as a \"guitar shop project\", as Only and Doyle constantly tweaked and refined their instruments throughout the band's existence, in an attempt to create what they felt would be the ultimate bass and guitar. In 1988, they formed The Doyle Fan Club in order to promote the new project and stay in touch with fans of The Misfits. According to various interviews conducted at the time, and a series of fan club letters written by Jerry Only (as \"Mo The Great\") from 1988 to 1990, Kryst the Conqueror was meant to be Only's vision of the \"perfect\" band. He hoped the \"righteous\" message of the band would reach out to fans, especially those who had followed former Misfits frontman, Glenn Danzig's post-Misfits career with the bands Samhain and Danzig - bands which Jerry felt were satanic, evil and possibly damaging to impressionable youths. A full album, Deliver Us From Evil, was recorded, although it has never been officially released in its entirety. Instead, five of the album's tracks were released in 1990 as an EP for a special Christmas package. The band never had an official lead singer, although noted Yngwie Malmsteen vocalist, Jeff Scott Soto, was hired to record vocals for the album. Although it has been rumoured for many years that Soto was under contract with Malmsteen this is in fact untrue. Soto set the record straight in and interview about his time recording the vocals for their debut in March 2015, he was billed on the EP as \"Kryst the Conqueror\"). Also, Dave \"The Snake\" Sabo did a guest guitar solo on the song \"Spellbound.\" Though the band never played live, Kryst the Conqueror survived as a non-active band until 1995, at which time Jerry and Doyle reached an out of court settlement with Glenn Danzig, granting them the rights to perform as The Misfits. Kryst the Conqueror was then quickly revamped into what would become the second incarnation of The Misfits. Some Kryst the Conqueror songs were eventually re-written into songs for the \"resurrected\" Misfits."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"La\u010Dni Franz was a rock band from Slovenia that was also popular in the 1980s in Titoist Yugoslavia. While they were inspired by another Slovenian radical band Buldo\u017Eer known for utilizing sheer madness in the social and political satire, their lyrics is more self-ironic. The band was formed in Maribor in June 1979. Their name, meaning hungry Franz, is a pun on the name of a character from the novel Catch-22, Hungry Joe, and describes hunger for rock music. The band's music and attitude was a kind of laid back, and they portrayed themselves as a local band from a provincial town. Zoran Predin's lyrics ranged from disturbing ballads (Ne mi dihat za ovratnik, Lipa zelenela je), through love songs (\u010Cakaj me, Naj ti poljub nari\u0161e ustnice), to social and political satire (Praslovan, Na\u0161a Lidija je pri vojakih). The key band members were frontman and songwriter Zoran Predin, and guitarist Oto Rimele. The band made the most creative success by the end of the 1980s, with classical albums such as Ikebana, Adijo pamet, Ne mi dihat za ovratnik, and Na svoji strani (the last one made with the original crew). Their last studio album was released in 1994. La\u010Dni Franz officially ceased to exist in 1997 after a series of compilation albums. Zoran Predin continued solo career after the Franz disbanded. Many band's hits, such as Praslovan, Bog nima telefona, Vaterpolist, Ne mi dihat za ovratnik, \u010Cakaj me or Naj ti poljub nari\u0161e ustnice, have remained in his concert repertoire. The band briefly regathered in winter 2005 - 2006, and held a series of concerts in Slovenia, Belgrade, and Zagreb."@en ;

Turilli developed the band to focus on his ability on the keyboard as his previous two projects mainly demonstrated his talent on the guitar and drums.

Fans have speculated Mystique's identity to be Bridget Fogle, who contributed to Turilli's 3rd album The Infinite Wonders of Creation, but as of 2015, this has not been confirmed. Shortly after the release of Lost Horizons, Turilli began work on a second Dreamquest album. In December 2006, it was reported that only the mixing was left to be completed.

	foaf:name	"Minnesota Youth Symphonies"@en ;
	dbo:abstract	"Minnesota Youth Symphonies, commonly referred to as MYS, was founded in 1972 by Ralph Winkler. The program has four orchestras composed of elementary through high school-aged musicians. Participation is based on an audition in which the prospective student must perform an appropriate solo, orchestral excerpt, scales and arpeggios, and must sight-read. Placement is based solely on audition results, rather than age. The String Orchestra, composed only of stringed instruments, is conducted by Pat Kelly, and is for students at the intermediate level. The Philharmonic Orchestra, conducted by Former Minnesota Orchestra Education Director Jim Bartsch, is a full orchestra for music students at the advanced-intermediate level. The Repertory Orchestra, conducted by MYS Co-Artistic Director Claudette Laureano, is offered for advanced students. The highest-level orchestra, the Symphony Orchestra, is conducted by MYS Co-Artistic Director Manny Laureano, and is a collegiate-level full orchestra. The orchestras perform three major concerts in the Twin Cities area, primarily at Orchestra Hall in Minneapolis. There are also other performance opportunities throughout the year. Student musicians throughout Minnesota and western Wisconsin audition annually for a position in one of the four orchestras, which rehearse on Saturday mornings. MYS also hosts various workshops and classes, and an annual summer music program that usually consists of a Chamber String workshop and a Composition workshop. Directors MYS has been under the artistic direction of Manny Laureano, principal trumpet of the Minnesota Orchestra, and his wife, Claudette Laureano, director of the Breck School's String Program, since 1988. Previous music/artistic directors have included Ralph Winkler, Ed Forner (former Assistant Conductor with the St. Paul Chamber Orchestra and Professor of Music at Macalester College), William McGlaughlin, Dr. Clyn D. Barrus and David Tuburgen. Under Winkler and Forner's initial leadership, MYS grew from a single orchestra to 3 ensembles ranging from beginning students to college-level musicians. Under Dr. Barrus' leadership, MYS grew to four orchestras and over 400 students. Under the Laureanos' leadership, MYS became known nationally as one of the nation's leading youth symphony organizations, adding a summer program and community outreach programs serving over 600 students. Alumni Several alumni of the Minnesota Youth Symphonies program hold positions with professional orchestras, such as the Cleveland Orchestra, Minnesota Orchestra, the Dallas Symphony Orchestra, the Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra and the St. Paul Chamber Orchestra.[1] Notable Years In 1972, the St. Paul Chamber Orchestra Society ended its sponsorship of the St. Paul Youth Orchestra. Many of the youth orchestra musicians and their parents were determined to continue the program. They persuaded its music director, Ralph Winkler, to establish a new youth orchestra, the Minnesota Youth Symphony. MYS was established as a place for serious young musicians to learn and be challenged. The students\u2019 hard work earned them an invitation in 1973 to perform in Romania, making MYS the first American youth orchestra to tour in a communist country. In 1992, the MYS Symphony Orchestra became the first orchestra to ever perform in the Super Bowl\u2019s half-time show when Super Bowl XXVI was played at the Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome in Minneapolis. MYS worked with one of the most distinguished film composers of the 20th century when Elmer Bernstein guest-conducted \u201CThe Magnificent Seven\u201D with the MYS Philharmonic Orchestra in 1997. MYS has collaborated with many noted guest artists, conductors and performing groups including Minnesota Orchestra Music Director Osmo Vanska, Butch Thompson, Charles Lazarus, Jorja Fleezanis, Bel Canto Chorus, St. Paul City Ballet, Minnesota Boys Choir, Ignacio \"Nachito\" Herrera, Doc Severinsen and the T.C. Swing Dancers, among many others. In the winter of 2007, MYS Symphony Orchestra, under the baton of Manny Laureano, performed Stravinksy's \"Rite of Spring\" in concert at Orchestra Hall, which was a first for MYS and maybe any other youth orchestra in Minnesota. The 2007-2008 season was particularly notable, as it marked the 35th Anniversary of MYS as well as the 20th Anniversary of Co-Artistic Directors Claudette and Manny Laureano. In honour of these events, each of the Minnesota Youth Symphonies\u2019 four orchestras premiered original works by Minnesotan composers. Full orchestral pieces were commissioned from composers Stephen Paulus, Shelley Hanson and MYS alumnus Edward (Teddy) Niedermaier. To select the fourth work, MYS held a composition competition open to MYS students and alumni under the age of 21. Aaron Hirsch, of Sleepy Eye, Minnesota won this contest with his composition for string orchestra. Since then, MYS has celebrated 40 years in existence, and the Laureanos have continued in artistic leadership. MYS has continued to collaborate with various artists and organizations from the Twin Cities and beyond. In 2015, MYS was invited to take part in the opening concerts at the newly renovated Ordway. During the roughly two-year renovation of Orchestra Hall, MYS has performed in various venues around the Twin Cities, such as churches and concert halls. The four orchestras continue to excel in artistic excellence season after season, and the MYS organization continues to expand in opportunities for youth to grow artistically and to be exposed to the best orchestral music education possible."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Mint Condition is an American R&B band from Saint Paul, Minnesota. Formed in the mid 1980s at Central High School in Saint Paul, Minnesota, its original members were Stokley Williams (lead vocals, drums, percussion), Homer O'Dell (guitar), Larry Waddell (keyboards, piano), Roger Lynch (son of Roger Troutman), Ray Coleman and Kenny Young. Lynch, Coleman and Young all left the group however and were replaced by schoolmates Keri Lewis (keyboards, synthesizer) and Jeffrey Allen (saxophone, keyboards) along with Chicago native Ricky Kinchen (bass). This lineup of Williams, O'Dell, Waddell, Allen, Lewis and Kinchen comprised the classic lineup of the band. Currently, this line-up remains intact, with the exception of Lewis, who left the group to focus on his marriage to Toni Braxton and produce for her and other artists. The group is well known for its diverse musical style (able to play anything from traditional jazz to mainstream R&B and rock-based music to funk grooves and even Latin and Jamaican-based rhythms) and also its captivating live performances. The band is also well known for their well written and produced R&B ballads, mainly in the 1990s. They are mostly known for their hits \"Breakin' My Heart (Pretty Brown Eyes)\" (1991) and \"What Kind of Man Would I Be\" (1996)."@en ;

The album was a major success and it is listed among the top ten rock albums ever released in Western Balkans. Mizar was formed in 1981 in the then Socialist Republic of Macedonia. Because of the band's avant-garde sound and image, its Christian leanings and support for Macedonian self-determination, they were viewed with certain degree of suspicion by the former authorities. Still, the group received great media attention including numerous appearances on the national television."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"The Pat McGee Band is a rock band from Richmond, Virginia. Formed by frontman Pat McGee, who attended Longwood University in Farmville, VA. On the heels of his solo release From the Wood in 1995, the Pat McGee Band signed with Warner Bros. Records subsidiary Giant Records in 1999. Shine, the band's major-label debut, was released in 2000 with the national singles \"Runaway\" and \"Rebecca\". After two years of delays, the band released their second album with Warner, Save Me, in 2004. The band was dropped from the label that year and picked up by Kirtland Records. An enhanced Save Me is now being distributed through Kirtland with the radio single \"Must Have Been Love\". Former guitarist and vocalist Al Walsh left the band in an amicable split at the end of 2001. Keyboardist and vocalist Jonathan Williams left in 2003 but rejoined the band in late 2005. Both were significant contributors to the band's sound, particularly in the form of backing vocals. The band didn't see another background vocalist until the 2003 addition of keyboardist/guitarist Todd Wright. Longtime bassist John Small left the band in 2004. With Jonathan's return, Todd Wright has left the band. Todd is now finding success as the front man of his own band, Getaway Car, where he's backed by guitarist Matt Miceli and Crix Reardon - while still a part of Pat McGee Band - on bass. Drummer Chris Williams died peacefully in his home October 28, 2006. As of June 2007, the band has severed ties with Kirtland Records and is once again recording independently. As of 2008, Matt \"Chew\" Calvarese has increasingly sat in as the band's new drummer."@en ;

Their music is characterized by very short, thrashcore-like, fast songs thematically concerned with zombies and the apocalypse, as the band name would imply. Their lyrics have a political undercurrent that uses horrific imagery as a metaphor to touch on various political, personal, and social issues. They have released two albums: This Is a Spark of Life, on Indecision Records and featuring artwork by Dan Henk, and a split with Leeds, UK-based, and fellow zombie enthusiasts, Send More Paramedics, called Tales Told by Dead Men, released in North America on Hell Bent Records and in Europe on In at the Deep End Records. They also contributed a cover of Welcome to the Jungle to a Guns N' Roses tribute album released by Reignition Records.

They had global success with The End of All Things to Come, Lost and Found and The New Game. Since 2010, the band has been inactive, with its members performing in other projects and making guest appearances. Chad Gray is the vocalist for the heavy metal supergroup Hellyeah, to which Greg Tribbett also belonged until 2014.

	dbo:abstract	"Pinhead Gunpowder is an American punk rock band that formed in East Bay, California, in 1990. The band has consisted of Aaron Cometbus (drums, lyrics), Bill Schneider (bass), Billie Joe Armstrong (guitar, vocals) and Jason White (guitar, vocals) for the majority of its existence. Sarah Kirsch (guitar, vocals), formerly known as Mike Kirsch, was the original guitarist, in place of White, but left the band citing personal differences with Green Day (the band for which Billie Joe Armstrong is most famous) and their major label debut album Dookie (1994). The band's name comes from a brand of \"high octane\" green tea served at the Arcata co-op and discovered by Aaron Cometbus during one of his many dumpster diving adventures. Cometbus, who releases the Cometbus fanzine, has played in many East Bay area bands such as Crimpshrine, Sweet Baby, The Thorns of Life and many more; Schneider is Green Day's former guitar tech and tour manager. Jason White plays additional guitar for Green Day; along with founding the seminal punk rock band Chino Horde. White has played in The Influents as well as The Big Cats. Sarah Kirsch has also been an active member in several East Bay bands such as Fuel, Torches to Rome, Bread and Circuits and many others. The vast majority of Pinhead Gunpowder's songs were written by Cometbus, although a few songs such as \"27\", \"Anniversary Song\" and \"New Blood\" were written by Billie Joe Armstrong under the pseudonym \"Wilhelm Fink\". Pinhead Gunpowder is a very elusive band. Over their 24+ year existence they have only released a few albums and only played 18 shows in total (that are known of). All of these shows have been on the west coast of the USA, mostly in the Bay Area. Their two lead singers are both members of Green Day and because of that the majority of their time is spent recording and touring for Green Day. Founder, drummer, and lyricist Aaron Cometbus is also busy writing his Cometbus zine, several novels, and in 2014 his first volume of poetry as well as producing artwork and playing in numerous bands. As a result of their busy lives Cometbus wrote that they knew upon forming Pinhead Gunpowder that it would have to be a part-time band that they could all come back to when they had free time."@en ;

They rely heavily on the Finnish rautalanka tradition. Although relatively unknown in the United States, their music is admired by many musicians, including Mike Campbell and Benmont Tench (of Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers), Mike Palm of Agent Orange (band), and Surf Rock legend Dick Dale. Al Jourgensen of Ministry has called them \"the best f**king band in the world.\" In addition to their touring, the band has also appeared several times on European television. The band was named after the Russian cosmonaut/dog Laika. As announced in an email to the band's mailing list on April 23, 2008, Laika and the Cosmonauts drew their twenty-year career to a close with an American tour, ending with shows at the Continental Club in Austin, Texas that fall. A compilation album, Cosmopolis, was released contemporaneously with the tour."@en ;

To date, the pair have only performed as the 5:15ers once, at the ArthurBall held at the Echoplex, a club in Echo Park, California. The set was a mix of tracks from both their respective careers, including a number of Masters of Reality songs, \"100 Days\" from Mark Lanegan's Bubblegum (Which both Goss and Homme contributed to) and \"You Would Know\" by Queens of the Stone Age. Another song played was a cover of \"Space For Rent\" by the Danish three-piece WhoMadeWho. The performance also included original work, with the song \"Into the Hollow\" later appearing on Era Vulgaris. When asked in February 2007 about the future of the project, Goss answered, \"There will be one show and more to follow. We're focusing on the show, but we have talked about doing a record\". Despite this, nothing has come into fruition since. On the band's musical direction, Goss opined that \"[It will be] something that's neither Masters of Reality or Queens of the Stone Age.

	dbo:abstract	"Porno para Ricardo (English: Porn for Richard) is a Cuban rock band founded in 1998. It is considered to be one of the most visible examples of young Cubans disagreement with the Castro's rule. Their lyrics are mostly about politics and contemporary Cuban society, and are harshly critical of the Cuban government. Their lyrics are frequently very explicit and strongly critical of Castro. The band was originally well received by the Cuban cultural scene. However, in 2003 Gorki \u00C1guila, the leader of the band, was arrested under drugs charges at a music festival in Pinar del Rio. He was imprisoned for 4 years only to be released after serving 2 years in prison. After his release, his lyrics became increasingly political. In March 2004 Gorki was nominated for the British Index on Censorship prize in the category \"Music\". The critical stance of the group against the regime accelerated only to be prohibited and their website cancelled the same year. In August 2008 \u00C1guila was arrested by the Cuban police with the charge of dangerousness, which allows them to detain people whom they think they are likely to commit crimes. The charge carries a penalty of up to four years in prison. He was eventually ordered to pay a $30 fine (2 months salary) for the lesser offense of public disorder which he paid after some hesitation in coins, after prosecutors dropped the more serious charge following intense international pressure after broad media coverage. This is an unprecedented event in Cuban jurisprudence; the communist government is usually strict about punishment given to independent journalists and other dissident voices. The group organizes a small recording studio for other prohibited groups that cannot play in Cuba called Paja Recolds."@en ;
