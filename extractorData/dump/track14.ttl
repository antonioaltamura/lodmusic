	dbo:abstract	"\"Leave Before the Lights Come On\" is a song by English indie rock band Arctic Monkeys. The song was released on 14 August 2006 as the band's third single in the United Kingdom. The song was not included on the band's debut album Whatever People Say I Am, That's What I'm Not, though Alex Turner has stated that it could have been on the album as it follows a similar theme to many of the album tracks. It was the band's final release before promotion began for their second album Favourite Worst Nightmare in Spring 2007. However, it was not included on their second album either. The single's release was confirmed on the band's website on 6 July 2006, and that the track would be released on Monday, 14 August, on 3 track CD and 2 track 7\" vinyl. The website did not offer any further information, but NME's website announced that the two b-side tracks for the single will be covers, \"one of which will be their version of an old song and the other a cover of a track by one of their favourite groups.\" In July 2006, it was confirmed on Gonzo that \"Put Your Dukes Up, John\" by The Little Flames would be one of the cover versions. On 17 July, it emerged on an Arctic Monkeys fansite that the other cover version would be \"Baby, I'm Yours\" originally recorded by Barbara Lewis. The official website soon confirmed this and added that the track would be a collaboration with the 747s. The single entered the UK singles charts at number four on 20 August 2006, their first not to top the chart. \"Leave Before the Lights Come On\" was the Arctic Monkeys' first single to enter the Canadian Singles Chart and debuted at number two behind Eva Avila's \"Meant to Fly\" (2006) by only fifteen copies. It descended to number three in its second week and remained on the chart for seven weeks. Alex Turner confirmed the release of the single in an interview with NME: \"'Leave Before the Lights Come On' feels very much like it could be on the album. So we're going to put that out as a single. I remember it's the last song that I wrote about that sort of time, going out and that. My life's not really like that any more.\""@en ;

dbr:Never_Tear_Us_Apart	rdf:type	dbo:MusicalWork ;
	dbo:abstract	"\"Never Tear Us Apart\" is a single released by Australian rock group INXS in August 1988. It was included on the band's sixth studio album, Kick. The music was written by keyboardist Andrew Farriss, who recorded a blues-style demo and gave it to vocalist Michael Hutchence who wrote the lyrics. \"Never Tear Us Apart\" is a sensuous ballad, written in the tempo of a modern Viennese waltz, layered with synthesizers and containing dramatic pauses before the instrumental breaks. Kirk Pengilly lends a cathartic saxophone solo near the end. According to the liner notes of Shine Like It Does: The Anthology (1979\u20131997), the song was composed on piano as a bluesy number in the style of Fats Domino. Producer Chris Thomas suggested a synth-based arrangement instead. The video for the song, featuring an extended intro, was filmed in various locations in Prague along with \"Guns in the Sky\" and \"New Sensation\", all directed by Richard Lowenstein. The single reached #24 in the UK, and stayed on the charts for seven weeks. In the U.S., it reached #7 on the Billboard Hot 100. After his death in 1997, Michael Hutchence's coffin was carried out of St. Andrews Cathedral by the remaining members of INXS and younger brother Rhett, as \"Never Tear Us Apart\" was played in the background. This song is now thought of by many original INXS fans as Hutchence's anthem. The song was used in the opening sequence of Donnie Darko: The Director's Cut. It would have been featured in the original release had the rights for it not been deemed too expensive by the producers. (\"The Killing Moon\" by Echo & the Bunnymen served as its replacement.) In 2006, the song was voted \"Nation's Favourite Lyric\" by viewers of pay TV music channel VH1 in Australia. The song has been adopted by The Squadron, the Newcastle United Jets supporter group, and sung in unison at the start and 90th minute of their A-League association football matches.[citation needed] This is in homage to the line, \"cause we all have wings, but some of us don't know why\", used now in reference to the Jets symbol of their club.[citation needed] The song's popularity among supporters has prompted a move to have the song be played at the beginning of each match, first happening on 18 October 2008, when the Jets defeated the Melbourne Victory 1\u22120.[citation needed] In February 2014, after the Channel 7 screening of \"INXS: Never Tear Us Apart\" mini-series, \"Never Tear Us Apart\" charted again in Australia via download sales. It peaked at #11 on the ARIA Singles Chart, surpassing its original peak position of #14 back in 1988."@en ;

Wonder is noted in the liner notes of the 4-CD set Hitsville USA: The Motown Singles Collection Volume 2 1972-1992 as describing the music for the song as an ode to \"You Can't Hurry Love\" and \"My World Is Empty Without You,\" both by The Supremes, former Motown label mates of Wonder."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"Shakespeare's Sister\" is a non-album single by British band The Smiths, released in March 1985. It first appeared on albums in 1987 via the Louder Than Bombs and The World Won't Listen compilations. Rock writer Jon Savage described it as \"essentially a suicide drama set to a demented rock'n'roll rhythm.\" Its title refers to a section of Virginia Woolf's feminist essay A Room of One's Own in which Woolf argues that if William Shakespeare had had a sister of equal genius, as a woman she would not have had the opportunity to make use of it. In reality, William Shakespeare had four sisters but the only one who survived past the age of eight was Joan. Sean O'Hagan says that Woolf's essay was \"one of the many feminist texts Morrissey embraced as a sexually confused, politically awakened adolescent.\" According to Simon Goddard the lyrics also draw on Elizabeth Smart's novella By Grand Central Station I Sat Down and Wept and the minor Billy Fury song \"Don't Jump\". The song's narrative has been compared to the play by Tennessee Williams 'The Glass Menagerie'. The original single's sleeve featured Pat Phoenix, best known for her long-running role as Elsie Tanner in the UK TV series Coronation Street. The song reached number 26 in the UK Singles Chart. The band Shakespears Sister [sic] took their name from the song."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"Sic Transit Gloria...Glory Fades\" is a 2004 single by the rock band Brand New from their second album Deja Entendu. The full phrase from which this song takes its title is Sic transit gloria mundi (Latin: \"Thus passes the glory of the world\"). This phrase has its origins in Ancient Rome, is used during Papal Coronations, and came to the attention of Brand New via the 1998 film Rushmore. The video raises parallels to two videos by the band Yellowcard, the strongest of which is the appearance of a white lamb on the door to the bar that Jesse Lacey enters. The symbol is also present on the briefcase that Ryan Key carries through the videos for \"Ocean Avenue\" and \"Rough Landing, Holly.\" This is because the videos were directed by Marc Webb, who used the lamb in his videos as a signature of sorts. It was rumored that the silhouette figure during the last shot in the video is Geoff Rickly,lead singer of the band Thursday (who are from nearby New Jersey), although it is actually Justin Beck, guitarist for Glassjaw. The 7\" was pressed on light pink vinyl and features a demo version of the song \"Jaws Theme Swimming.\" This demo song was recorded and mixed by Mike Sapone.

dbr:The_One_on_the_Right_Is_on_the_Left	rdf:type	dbo:MusicalWork ;
	dbo:abstract	"\"The One on the Right Is on the Left\" is a country song written by Jack Clement. It was recorded by Johnny Cash on November 29, 1965 and included on his album Everybody Loves a Nut (1966). It was the album's third and most successful single (see 1966 in music), reaching number two on the U.S. Billboard Country Singles chart and forty-six on Billboard's Pop Singles chart. The song is a humorous criticism of musicians that put their political views into their music. It tells the story of a folk song group that is \"long on musical ability\", but ultimately breaks up due to political differences.At the end of the song, a warning is given not to mix politics with one's music. The punch line to the joke is that \"the guy in the rear\", is less easily labeled: he is a Methodist and he burned his driver's license (rather than his draft card), etc. Indeed, the song closes by stating that he got drafted. The song was covered, with a few lyrics slightly modified, by Canadian punk rock band Youth Youth Youth on their 1982 demo as well as their Repackaged (album) LP released in 1989 on Fringe Records. Noel Harrison sang the song on The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour on June 11, 1967. They ended the song by pointing out they had no \"guy in the rear\" and walked off."@en ;

When watching the video, one can see that Chris and Ben's animated characters seem to be more fluid and realistic than Daniel's. This may be due to Chris and Ben doing some sort of motion capture for the making of the video.

The single's title track was a remix of Cheatham's 1983 UK No. 38 hit, \"Get Down Saturday Night\". It also debuted and peaked at No. 5 in Ireland, and stayed at that position for the four weeks it was No. 1 in the UK, while also peaking at No. 34 in Australia. Its success was partly due to its use in a popular television advertising campaign for Lynx Pulse deodorant. The duo released another collaboration, \"Music And You\" in 2003, which made No. 38 in the UK Singles Chart. In 2005, a new album, named Make Luv: The 2005 Mixes came out, which included official remixes by DJ Tonka, Laurent Konrad and Axwell. Cheatham died on November 29, 2013, at the age of 65, following a heart attack in his sleep."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"Merry Xmas Everybody\" is a 1973 song by the English rock band Slade. Written by lead vocalist and guitarist Noddy Holder and bassist Jim Lea, and produced by Chas Chandler, it was the band's sixth number-one single in the UK. It earned the UK Christmas Number One slot in December 1973, beating another Christmas-themed song, Wizzard's \"I Wish It Could Be Christmas Everyday\", which reached fourth place. By mid-January it was still at number one; it stayed in the UK Singles Chart well into February 1974. Based on melodies from discarded songs written six years before, \"Merry Xmas Everybody\" was Slade's best-selling single, released at the peak of their popularity, and sold over a million copies upon its first release. It is Slade's last number-one single, and by far their most successful. It has been released during every decade since 1973, and has been covered by numerous artists. In a 2007 poll, \"Merry Xmas Everybody\" was voted the UK's most popular Christmas song. According to the Fan Club Newsletter for January and February 1974, the song was rewarded a Silver Disc for pre-order sales, even before the single's release. Within the first week of release, the single had sold 500,000 copies. Also, according to the same newsletter, \"Merry Xmas Everybody\" was in such big demand that Polydor records had to make special arrangements to have 250,000 discs sent from Los Angeles, as well as 30,000 copies a day they were receiving from Germany. The single was certified UK Platinum by BPI in December 1980. Since 2007 and the advent of downloads counting toward the UK Singles Chart, it has re-entered the charts each December. Therefore, it has sold 1.21 million copies in the UK as of December 2012. On 8 December 2013 it re-entered the UK Singles Charts, at number 57."@en ;

The album Minor Earth Major Sky was released in the UK on 22 May 2000, having been released in much of Europe on 27 March. The song was originally hastily written after A-ha agreed to a one-time reunion at the Nobel Peace Prize concert in 1998. There had been a lot of bad feelings between the band members, and each was hesitant to reunite.[citation needed] The thunderous success at the concert in performing only two songs inspired the band to reunite after a four year hiatus to record their sixth album for release in 2000. This song became a #1 radio hit in much of Europe, and the band has continued to record and perform together to significant international success, though that success has not extended to the U.S., where their recent work has gone unreleased. The song sold 2,500,000 copies worldwide.[citation needed]"@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"This Ain't a Scene, It's an Arms Race\" is a song by American rock band Fall Out Boy and the lead single from their commercially successful third studio album Infinity on High (2007). The song officially debuted on November 21 at the American Music Awards and was shipped to radio stations that night (with an impact date of December 5 in the United States).[citation needed] The music was composed by vocalist and guitarist Patrick Stump and the lyrics were penned by bassist Pete Wentz, following the band's songwriting approach which first began with some songs on their 2003 album Take This to Your Grave. Production was handled by Neal Avron, who also produced the band's previous From Under the Cork Tree album. Commenting on the band's decision to pick the track as the first single, Wentz said \"There may be other songs on the record that would be bigger radio hits, but this one had the right message.\" The track was a commercial success and the band's major international breakthrough. \"This Ain't a Scene, It's an Arms Race\" debuted and peaked at No. 2 on the US Billboard Hot 100 with 162,000 first week sales and broke various records. It is the group's first single to chart worldwide in countries including Australia, New Zealand and most of the European nations, where it reached the top five in many. After its Platinum RIAA and ARIA certifications in 2007, in 2013 it was certified Silver by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) for 200,000 sales. In Australia, it spent nine consecutive weeks at either No. 4 or No. 5. The song was released as a downloadable track for the video game Rock Band on May 6, 2008, and is also on Rock Band Track Pack Volume 2. The January 2009 issue of PlayStation: The Official Magazine lists Fall Out Boy's \"This Ain't a Scene, It's an Arms Race\" as second on its list of Rock Band's Five Most Unexpectedly Rockin' Downloadable Songs.

	dbo:abstract	"\"One Bad Apple\" was a number-one hit single released by The Osmonds on November 14, 1970. It debuted on the Billboard Hot 100 on January 2, 1971. It hit the top of the chart on February 13, 1971 and stayed there for five weeks. It also reached number six on the R&B chart. Billboard ranked it as the No. 4 song for 1971. Both \"One Bad Apple\" and the Donny Osmond-credited single \"Sweet and Innocent\" are on the 1970 album Osmonds. It was certified Gold by the RIAA on February 4, 1971. The song was written by George Jackson, who originally had the Jackson 5 in mind when he wrote it. The Osmonds' version coincidentally sounded like the Jackson 5 to the point many mistook the Osmonds for the Jacksons on the song when first hearing it.[citation needed] According to Donny Osmond, Michael Jackson later told him that the Jackson 5 almost recorded this song first, but chose to record \"ABC\" instead.[citation needed] \"One Bad Apple\" was also used as the theme to The Osmonds cartoon show on ABC-TV."@en ;

The song features vocals by singer Keri Hilson and rapper D.O.E.. All three artists co-wrote the song together with Danja, The Clutch, and Candice Nelson. Timbaland and Danja also produced the song together. Mosley Music Group, in association with Blackground Records and Interscope Records, serviced the song to contemporary hit and rhythmic radios in the United States on June 15, 2007. \"The Way I Are\" is an electropop and disco song with influences of R&B and dance music that help create its futuristic sound. Its lyrics are based on the theme of role reversal and sensuous desires. \"The Way I Are\" received generally mixed reviews from music critics. Many complimented the song's futuristic dance sound while others dismissed the lyrics. There were notable comparisons made by critics to songs from Justin Timberlake's album FutureSex/LoveSounds, especially \"My Love\" (2007) and \"SexyBack\" (2006). The song fared better commercially around the world. It peaked at number three on the Billboard Hot 100 and sold over 3 million units in the United States. It became Timbaland's second solo single to reach the top five in the country as well as his second longest-running single there, behind \"Apologize\". Internationally, \"The Way I Are\" reached number one in several countries including Australia, Canada, Denmark, Ireland and the United Kingdom. Elsewhere, the song reached the top five region in all other countries including Austria, France, Germany, New Zealand and Russia. The accompanying music video was directed by Shane Drake and takes place in a dark alley-like area in Salford, England. The video also features Timbaland's brother Sebastian, who contributes an extra verse after the bridge. The director noted that the influence of making the video came from the sound of the song and used the rhythm and beats to add effects to make the video have an edgy appeal. \"The Way I Are\" received a nomination for Monster Single of the Year at the MTV Video Music Awards, as well as a nomination under the Producer of the Year (Non-Classical), listed with other songs produced by Timbaland and released during 2007, at the 2008 Grammys.

It was chosen over thousands of other entries in a songwriting contest for fan-written songs to be sung on the show. The song was later included on her debut album, Jordin Sparks (2007). Lewis sang it first during the May 22 show and received poor reviews from the judges, because the song was not Lewis' style of music. He later revealed in an interview that the producers of the show did not allow him to rearrange the song because \"it was the song that won the contest\". Sparks received better feedback and Simon Cowell stated that she \"wiped the floor\" with Lewis' rendition.

Released on their self-titled album Loggins and Messina, it reached #4 on the Billboard pop chart and #19 on the Billboard Easy Listening Chart as a single in early 1973. This song, whose refrain and first verse is done in a blues format, deals with the 1950s and 1960s lifestyle concerning the generation gap, where the parents oppose the Rock and Roll Revolution, of the younger generation, which includes the rebelliousness against the old society that monitors curfews on dating, as well as being arrested for making love with a girl in the back seat of a car, during a drive-in movie, which happens during the bridge section of the song. When released as a single, it was the duo's biggest hit as well as their only Gold single. \"Your Mama Don't Dance\" was covered in 1985 by the rock band Y&T, in 1988 by the rock band Poison, and it was the fourth single from their second album Open Up and Say...Ahh!. The Poison version released as a single in 1989 on Capitol Records reached number 10 on the Billboard Hot 100 and #39 on the Mainstream rock charts and has since gone Gold in the US.

Of all the Toadies material, this release displays the strongest Pixies resemblance, with Kim Deal remarking after she heard \"Dig a Hole\" that, \"It sounds like us!\"[citation needed] The song is built on a simple recurring bass line and power chords and contains the memorable line, \"Like pervert's words, I'm strung together/to make some pervert God feel better.\" The song was written as a response to Todd Lewis's distaste for what was then the most popular style in the Fort Worth-Dallas region. \u2033There was a huge movement of Edie Brickell-barefoot-hippie music. It's kind of making a resurgence now, and man, I hate that stuff. So that gave us something that worked up a lot of good bile. We made our first tape to get out of Fort Worth and into Dallas when all that was going on, and we wrote this song\u2014one of our more mature efforts\u2014called 'I Hope You Die.'

Written by Miracles members Smokey Robinson and Pete Moore and produced by Robinson, the song was a top 20 pop single on the Billboard Hot 100 in the United States, on which it peaked at number 18. On Billboard's R&B singles chart, \"It's Growing\" peaked at number 3. This single was the follow-up to \"My Girl\", which was the first to feature David Ruffin as the Temptations new lead singer. Ruffin, as the song's narrator, tells his lover that his love for her keeps on growing each and every day, giving several comparations to illustrate how much it grows. The song starts with a toy piano playing before the drums kick start the song, going into mid-tempo dance number. Motown had hoped to repeat the success of the previous single by giving \"It's Growing\" a somewhat similar sound but with a bigger orchestration and adding The Andantes for additional backing vocals. This single, the second from The Temptations Sing Smokey, would be backed by the Eddie Kendricks-led cover of The Miracles' \"What Love Has Joined Together.\" While not as successful as the previous single, it still made the Top 20 in the Pop charts, continuing Robinson's reign as the group's main producer."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"Another Suitcase in Another Hall\" is a song recorded by Scottish singer Barbara Dickson, for the 1976 concept album, Evita, which contains songs from the musical of the same name. The musical was based on the life of Argentinian leader Eva Per\u00F3n. Written by Tim Rice and Andrew Lloyd Webber, the song is presented during a sequence where Eva throws out her husband's mistress on the streets. The latter sings the track, wondering about her future and coming to the conclusion that she would be fine. Dickson was enlisted by the songwriters to record the track after hearing her previous work. Rice and Webber asked her to record the song using a higher than usual pitch, so that she sounded younger like her character. Featuring instrumentation from guitar, marimba, harp and keyboard, \"Another Suitcase in Another Hall\" finds Dickson singing in a soprano voice. Critically appreciated, the song was released as a single on 7 February 1977, and reached number 18 on the UK Singles Chart. Dickson has stated that she did not like her recorded version of the track and employed a different arrangement during her future live renditions. The song has been covered and performed many times by other artists, namely Elaine Paige, Marti Webb, Kimberley Walsh from British girl group Girls Aloud, as well as actress Samantha Barks. Another notable version was recorded by American singer Madonna who played the part of Eva for the 1996 film adaptation of the musical. It was released on 3 March 1997, by Warner Bros. as the third and final single from the film's soundtrack. Unlike the musical, in the film the track was sung by Madonna's character instead of the mistress. Upon its release, the song garnered positive response from music critics and reached the top-ten of the charts in Italy and the United Kingdom."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"Baby Boy\" is a song by American singer-songwriter Beyonc\u00E9, featuring singer Sean Paul. It was written by Beyonc\u00E9, Sean Paul, Scott Storch, Robert Waller, and Jay-Z for Beyonc\u00E9's debut solo studio album Dangerously in Love (2003). It was also on the Grammy Award-winning album Dutty Rock which was re-released in 2003. Containing a lyrical interpolation of \"No Fear\" by hip hop group O.G.C, \"Baby Boy\" is an R&B and dancehall song with reggae and Arabic music influences; its lyrics detail a woman's fantasies. Columbia Records released \"Baby Boy\" as the second single from Dangerously in Love to United States radios on August 3, 2003. It was well received by music critics, who complimented the Indian, Middle Eastern music and dancehall styles in the song, as well as Beyonc\u00E9's collaboration with Paul. \"Baby Boy\" topped the US Billboard Hot 100 chart for nine consecutive weeks, and was Beyonc\u00E9's longest-running solo number-one single until 2007. It reached the top ten in many countries, and was certified platinum in Australia and the US. The song's music video was directed by Jake Nava and mostly shows Beyonc\u00E9 dancing in various locations. \"Baby Boy\" has remained a staple of Beyonc\u00E9's concert set list. The American Society of Composers, Authors, and Publishers (ASCAP) recognized it as one of the most performed songs of 2005. During the same year, US singer-songwriter Jennifer Armour filed a copyright infringement lawsuit claiming that Beyonc\u00E9 had used the primary musical hook from her song \"Got a Little Bit of Love for You\".

	dbo:abstract	"\"Crazy for You\" is a song by American singer Madonna from the soundtrack album to the 1985 film Vision Quest. It was released on March 2, 1985 by Geffen Records as the first single from the soundtrack. The song appears remixed on the greatest hits compilation The Immaculate Collection (1990) and was re-released on February 24, 1991 by Sire Records to promote the album. The song was also included on the ballads compilation Something to Remember (1995) and the greatest hits compilation Celebration (2009). Producers Jon Peters and Peter Guber, along with music director Phil Ramone, decided to use Madonna after listening to her previous recordings, employing John Bettis and Jon Lind to write the song. After reading the script of the film, Bettis and Lind wrote the song about the situation in which the lead characters meet at a nightclub. Initial recording sessions did not impress Bettis and Lind, and they felt that \"Crazy for You\" would be dropped from the soundtrack. However, a new version was recorded to their liking. John \"Jellybean\" Benitez was the producer for the song, and it was a challenge for him, as previously he was associated with recording dance-pop songs only. Initially Warner Bros. Records did not want the song to be released as a single, since they believed that it would take away the attention from Madonna's second studio album Like a Virgin (1984). In the end, Peters and Guber convinced Warner officials to greenlight its release. \"Crazy for You\" ushered a new musical direction for Madonna, as she had not previously released a ballad as a single. The track features instrumentation from snare drums, harp, bass synthesizer and electric guitar. Lyrically, the song speaks of sexual desire between two lovers and consists of innuendos. \"Crazy for You\" received positive response from music critics and earned Madonna her first Grammy Award nomination in the Best Female Pop Vocal Performance category in 1986. The song became Madonna's second number-one single on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100, and reached the top position in the charts of Australia and Canada as well. It also peaked at number two in Ireland, New Zealand and the United Kingdom, where it was released twice, once in 1985 and again in 1991. Madonna has performed \"Crazy for You\" in two of her concert tours, The Virgin Tour in 1985 and the Re-Invention World Tour in 2004. The performance from The Virgin Tour was included in the home video releases on VHS and LaserDisc whereas the Re-Invention World Tour remains unreleased. \"Crazy for You\" has been covered by a number of artists."@en ;

Its lyrics describe a romantic obsession that causes the protagonist to act out of character. Jay Z contributes a rapped verse to the song and is credited as a featured performer.

Written by Curtis Hudson and Lisa Stevens of Pure Energy, the track was offered to Madonna by her producer John \"Jellybean\" Benitez when she was looking for a potential hit track to include in her debut album. After accepting the song, she and Jellybean worked on it and altered its composition by the addition of a piano solo performed by their friend, Fred Zarr. \"Holiday\" features instrumentation from guitars, electronic handclaps, a cowbell, and a synthesized string arrangement, while its lyrics speak about the universal sentiment of taking a holiday. Universally acclaimed by critics, the song became Madonna's first hit single when it entered the top 20 of the Billboard Hot 100, topping its dance chart, and also becoming a crossover success, entering the top ten and top 40 of many European countries. Madonna has performed \"Holiday\" on most of her tours and it is generally included as a part of the encore. Different performances of the song are included in the recorded releases of her tours.

It was featured on the re-issue of her second studio album Like a Virgin (1984), and released on July 23, 1985, by Sire Records as the album's fourth single outside North America. The original song was included on her third greatest hits album, Celebration (2009), while remixes of it appeared on the remix compilation You Can Dance (1987), and her first greatest hits compilation The Immaculate Collection (1990). Madonna's inspiration behind the song was the dance floor, and she wrote it while watching a handsome Puerto Rican man, across her balcony. Initially written for her friend Mark Kamins, Madonna later decided to use it as the soundtrack of her film Desperately Seeking Susan. \"Into the Groove\" was recorded at Sigma Sound Studios. A remixed version, titled \"Into the Hollywood Groove\", was created by Madonna in 2003 for a Gap commercial and featured a rap by Missy Elliott. \"Into the Groove\" consists of instrumentation from synthesizers and drum machines. Madonna's voice is double tracked in the chorus; the song also consists of musical contrasts, overdubs, and Madonna's voice in lower register during the bridge. The lyrics of the song are simple, written as an invitation to dance with the singer. However, it carries sexual innuendos and undertones in the meaning. The song was appreciated by contemporary critics as well as authors, who frequently called it \"Madonna's first great single\". The song was a commercial success, reaching the top of the charts in Australia, Belgium, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Netherlands, New Zealand, Spain and the United Kingdom, where it was Madonna's first number-one single. In the United States, the song was only available as the B-side of the 12-inch single of \"Angel\", therefore it was ineligible to chart on the Billboard Hot 100 according to the rules at the time. By the end of the 1980s, \"Into the Groove\" was honored by Billboard magazine as the Dance Single of the Decade. A music video, consisting of clips from the film, was released to accompany the song. The song has been performed by Madonna in most of her concert tours, including the Sticky & Sweet Tour (2008\u201309), where she performed it while doing Double Dutch jump rope. \"Into the Groove\" has been covered by a number of artists, including Australian singer Dannii Minogue, who combined the song with her single \"Don't Wanna Lose This Feeling\"."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"Like a Virgin\" is a song by American singer Madonna. It is the title track from her second studio album Like a Virgin (1984), and was released on November 6, 1984 by Sire Records as the first single from the album. The song appears on the greatest hits compilation albums The Immaculate Collection (1990) and Celebration (2009). It was written by Billy Steinberg and Tom Kelly and produced by Nile Rodgers; Steinberg said that the song was inspired by his personal experiences of romance. \"Like a Virgin\" was chosen for Madonna by Michael Ostin of Warner Bros. Records after listening to a demo sung by Kelly. However, Rodgers initially felt that the song did not have a sufficient hook and was not suitable for Madonna, but subsequently changed his opinion after the hook was stuck in his mind. Musically \"Like a Virgin\" is a dance-oriented song, composed of two hooks. Madonna's voice is heard in a high register while a continuous arrangement of drums are heard along the bassline. The lyrics of the song are ambiguous and consist of hidden innuendo. In sexual terms, the lyrics can be interpreted in different ways for different people. \"Like a Virgin\" received positive reviews from contemporary as well as old critics, who frequently called it as one of the defining songs for Madonna. It became her first number-one single on the Billboard Hot 100, while reaching the top of the charts in Australia, Canada, and Japan, and the top-ten of the other countries. The music video portrayed Madonna sailing down the canals of Venice in a gondola, as well as roaming around a palace wearing a white wedding dress. With the video, scholars noted Madonna's portrayal of a sexually independent woman, the symbolism of the appearance of a man with lion's mask to that of Saint Mark, and compared the eroticism of the video to the vitality of the city of Venice. Madonna has performed the song in six of her concert tours, most recent being the Rebel Heart Tour in 2015. Most of the time, her performances of \"Like a Virgin\" were associated with strong reaction and uproar from the media. \"Like a Virgin\" has been covered by a number of artists and has appeared or referenced in feature films such as Reservoir Dogs, Moulin Rouge! and Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason. Family groups sought to ban it as they believed the song promoted sex without marriage. On the other hand, Madonna's public persona of an indomitable, sexually unashamed, supremely confident woman was widely accepted by the younger generation who emulated her style and fashion. Scholars have credited \"Like a Virgin\" as the song which cemented her position as a pop culture icon."@en ;

After its release, \"Love Profusion\" received generally favorable reviews from music critics.

Its accompanying music video, directed by Jonas \u00C5kerlund, portrays Madonna and her friends giving a party in her limousine, driven by comedian Ali G. In order to promote its parent album, Madonna performed the song during the MTV Europe Music Awards 2000 and at the following year at the 43rd Annual Grammy Awards. Additionally, \"Music\" has been performed on five of Madonna's concert tours, the most recent being 2015-16's Rebel Heart Tour. \"Music\" was nominated at Grammy Awards in the categories of \"Record of the Year\" and Best Female Pop Vocal Performance in 2001."@en ;

dbr:Nothing_Fails	rdf:type	dbo:MusicalWork ;
	dbo:abstract	"\"Nothing Fails\" is a song by American singer-songwriter Madonna from her ninth studio album, American Life (2003). Written by Madonna, Guy Sigsworth and Jem Griffiths, and produced by the singer along with Mirwais Ahmadza\u00EF and Mark \"Spike\" Stent, it was released as the third single from the album on October 26, 2003. Originally titled \"Silly Thing\", \"Nothing Fails\" is a love song which has acoustic guitar chords and a gospel choir appearance. Lyrically, the song discusses a lover who is the one, and how their meeting was not just chance. A number of remixes of the song were done, with one of them being included on Madonna's remix album Remixed & Revisited (2003). The song received generally positive reviews, with music critics praising it as one of the best tracks from American Life, while others compared it with Madonna's previous single \"Like a Prayer\" (1989), as both songs feature a gospel choir. \"Nothing Fails\" was released in the US in hopes of attaining sales from American Life. However, it did not chart on the US Billboard Hot 100, making it the second single from the album to fail to chart in the US. However, the song reached number one on the Hot Dance Club Songs and Hot Singles Sales charts. Internationally, the song was a success, reaching the top ten in Australia, Belgium, Canada and Italy while topping the charts in Spain. Although initially reported on the contrary, no music video was filmed for \"Nothing Fails\". The song was performed during a promotional tour for American Life in 2003, along with other songs from the album and her past hits. One of these performances was shown by MTV in a special named Madonna on Stage & on the Record. It was also performed during Madonna's sixth concert tour, the Re-Invention World Tour (2004), with Madonna alone on stage singing the song accompanied by an acoustic guitar. Many reviewers noted that Madonna in the performance was a \"solitary figure\" as it was herself alone playing the acoustic guitar."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"The Inner Light\" is a song by the English rock band the Beatles, written by George Harrison. It was released on a non-album single in March 1968, as the B-side to \"Lady Madonna\". The song was the first Harrison composition to be featured on a Beatles single and reflects the band's embracing of Transcendental Meditation. The lyrics are a rendering of a poem from the Taoist Tao Te Ching, which Harrison set to music on the recommendation of Sanskrit scholar Juan Mascar\u00F3, who had translated the passage in his 1958 book Lamps of Fire. The song became a comparative rarity among the Beatles' recordings in the decade following its release; it has subsequently appeared on compilation albums such as Rarities, Past Masters, Volume Two and Mono Masters. Harrison recorded the instrumental track for \"The Inner Light\" in India in January 1968, during the sessions for his Wonderwall Music soundtrack album. The only Beatles studio recording to be made outside Europe, the song introduced instruments such as sarod, shehnai and pakhavaj to the band's sound and features contributions from Indian classical musicians including Aashish Khan, Hanuman Jadev and Hariprasad Chaurasia. Aside from Harrison's lead vocal, recorded in London, the Beatles' only contribution came in the form of group backing vocals at the end of the song. Among music critics, \"The Inner Light\" has received praise for the its melodic qualities and for its evocation of the meditation experience. Jeff Lynne and Anoushka Shankar performed the song at the Concert for George tribute in November 2002, a year after Harrison's death. An alternative take of the 1968 instrumental track was released in 2014 on the remastered Wonderwall Music CD. Screenwriter Morgan Gendel named a 1992 episode of the television series Star Trek: The Next Generation as an homage to the song."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"You Must Love Me is a song recorded by American singer and songwriter Madonna. It was written by Andrew Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice, for the 1996 film adaptation of the musical, Evita, based on the life of Argentinian leader Eva Per\u00F3n. The song was released on October 27, 1996, by Warner Bros. as the lead single from the film's soundtrack. After years of not working together due to their individual projects, Webber and Rice collaborated on creating a new track for the film, with the hopes of obtaining an Academy Award nomination for Best Original Song. According to Webber, the song's main inspiration was to showcase Per\u00F3n's emotional state at the time as well as her relationship with husband Juan Per\u00F3n. Madonna, who starred in the titular role of the film, had tried to change the lyrics of the track to create a sympathetic portrayal of Per\u00F3n, but was unsuccessful. She also undertook vocal lessons to record the songs for the film. \"You Must Love Me\" features instrumentation from cello and piano which accompanies Madonna's vocals. The song garnered positive response from music critics, many of them highlighting Madonna's enhanced singing ability. It went on to win the Golden Globe and the Academy Award for Best Original Song in 1997. Commercially, \"You Must Love Me\" became a top-ten hit in some countries including Finland, Italy and the United Kingdom, while reaching the top-twenty in the United States. It was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for shipments of 500,000 physical units. A music video, directed by Alan Parker, was released as promotion for the single. Madonna has performed the song at the 69th Academy Awards and on her 2008\u201309 Sticky & Sweet Tour."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"Club Tropicana\" is a song by British pop duo Wham!, released in 1983 on Innervision Records. It was written by George Michael and Andrew Ridgeley. The song was a mild departure from Wham!'s previous singles, which had all been motivated by social or political issues. \"Club Tropicana\", however, was a satire of the boom for cheap package holidays for younger, single people of a hedonistic nature. It was specifically seen in the UK as a swipe at the very popular Club 18-30 scheme. A memorable video directed by Duncan Gibbins was made at Pikes Hotel in Ibiza, with scenes of George and Andrew on the beach, making eyes at bikini-clad girls played by their backing singers Dee C. Lee and Shirlie Holliman. They were also seen relaxing by a pool and sipping cocktails, along with the famous scene of trumpet-playing taking place in the pool itself. A twist in the sexual tension between the two men and two women was revealed at the end, when it turned out that Michael and Ridgeley were airline pilots and Dee and Shirlie were stewardesses. The song was released in July 1983 and peaked at #4 in the UK, going on to become the 39th best selling single of 1983. It was the fourth and final single to be taken from the album Fantastic. Wham! went on to dominate the UK charts, achieving four #1 singles before splitting at their height in 1986. The song is also included in the Japanese release of Twenty Five."@en ;

However, upon re-release in 1993, it became a worldwide hit. Attendees of Radiohead's early gigs often exhibited little interest in the band's other songs, causing the band to react against \"Creep\" and play it less often during the mid-to-late 1990s. In 1998, halfway through their OK Computer tour, the band dropped the song from set lists altogether. \"Creep\" was not played live again until 2001, but it has since reappeared several times on the band's live sets. The song is included in the Radiohead: The Best Of compilation album. The artwork for the single is a painting by Maurice Burns, called \"Craigavon Under Age Drinkers Rule\"."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"Diamonds\" is a song recorded by Barbadian singer Rihanna for her seventh studio album, Unapologetic (2012). It was written by Sia Furler together with its producers, Benny Blanco and StarGate. The song premiered on September 26, 2012, during the Elvis Duran and the Morning Show and was digitally released the following day as the lead single from Unapologetic. Def Jam Recordings serviced the single to contemporary hit radio in the United States on October 2. \"Diamonds\" is a mid-tempo electronic and pop ballad that features heavy synthesizers, orchestral sounds and electronic rhythms. The song's lyrics serve as a departure from the themes of unhealthy relationships that were on Rihanna's previous singles and contain a prominent concept of love. \"Diamonds\" was well received by most critics, some of whom complimented Rihanna's different musical direction, while others criticized the song's production. The single topped music charts in over twenty countries, including the United States, where it became Rihanna's twelfth number one single on the Billboard Hot 100 and tied her with Madonna and The Supremes for the fifth-most number one singles in the chart's history. \"Diamonds\" was certified five-times platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) and sold over 3.5 million digital copies in the country. By May 2013, it had sold over 7.5 million copies worldwide and became one of the best-selling singles of all-time. The song's music video was shot by director Anthony Mandler, a frequent collaborator of Rihanna's, and depicts her in four environments that represent the elements of earth, air, water and fire. The video received positive reviews and was praised for its imagery. Some critics believe that the heavily tattooed man intertwined with Rihanna's arm in the video resembles Chris Brown. The singer performed \"Diamonds\" on television shows such as Saturday Night Live and The X Factor and included it on the 777, Diamonds and The Monster Tour set lists. The American Society of Composers, Authors, and Publishers (ASCAP) recognized it as one of the most performed songs of 2013 and 2014. The official remix of \"Diamonds\" featured rapper Kanye West and was released on November 16, 2012. The song has been covered by various recording artists, including Josef Salvat, who released his own cover of \"Diamonds\" as a single."@en ;

Featuring Michael and Jackie Jackson on lead vocals, it was the first non-Motown single for the group since they departed from the label earlier that year. The song peaked at #6 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart on February 19, 1977 and #2 on the R&B chart. On February 14, 1989, it became the group's first single to be certified Platinum by the RIAA. It was also the group's first song to feature new member Randy Jackson, who replaced Jermaine when he decided to stay at Motown after his brothers left. It also featured backing vocals from sisters Janet and La Toya, who would also launch successful solo careers. The song is sampled on the track \"Let's Have a Party\" by the Backstreet Boys, which appears on their 1996 self-titled debut album. The song is credited to Philadelphia songwriters/producers Gamble and Huff; however, a session musician from Gamble and Huff\u2019s in-house band recalled that the late guitarist T.J. Tindall wrote the riff that was the initial spark for the song. A music video was produced to promote the single, for this was the Jacksons' very first video.

It debuted on Italian radio as the album's third single on March 28, 2014. It was developed while Gaga was touring with Born This Way Ball, and was recorded a number of times for the final version. \"G.U.Y.\" is an EDM track containing elements of industrial, contemporary R&B, and house music whose lyrics address a number of subjects like sexual dominance, submission, and gender roles. \"G.U.Y.\" received mixed reviews from music critics, who complimented the composition of the track and Gaga's vocals, but criticized its lyrics and production. The song debuted on the record charts of a few countries, but failed to enter the top ten in most of them. In the United States, \"G.U.Y.\" became Gaga's lowest charting single on the Billboard Hot 100, peaking at number 76. It reached the top ten on airplay charts of Bulgaria and Croatia, the Billboard Greek Digital Songs chart, and the US Hot Dance Club Songs chart. The music video for the song was shot at Hearst Castle, located near San Simeon. The video featured reality TV show actors like The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills, and works of artist Nathan Sawaya and YouTube's Minecraft gamer SkyDoesMinecraft. Running for over 11 minutes, the video shows Gaga as a wounded fallen angel who is revived by her followers in a pool. Once rejuvenated, she takes revenge on the men who hunted her and replaces them with clones known as G.U.Y. The video received positive reviews for its visuals and its references to Greek mythology. Gaga has performed \"G.U.Y.\" on her seven day residency shows at Roseland Ballroom in March 2014 and at ArtRave: The Artpop Ball; in both places she emulated the choreography from the music video on stage, and received positive critical response."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"Hunter\" is a song by Icelandic musician Bj\u00F6rk from her fourth studio album, Homogenic (1997). The lyrics of \"Hunter\" explore the pressure Bj\u00F6rk felt to write music after realising the workforce that depended on her, following the success she found as a solo artist with her previous studio albums. The first time the song saw the light of day was at the 1997 Tibetan Freedom Concert and later with the online promotional release of Homogenic; the track was subsequently released as the third single for the album as three different CD releases in October 1998. A collaborative effort between Bj\u00F6rk and Mark Bell, \"Hunter\" features a dark combination of strings and layered synths, a militaristic electronic beat, and enigmatic lyrics about the heading towards a mission. Most commentators were enticed by \"Hunter\", which they declared one of the highlights of the Homogenic album. The single performed poorly at the music charts, it peaked at number forty-four on the UK Singles Chart and number fifty-five on the French Singles Chart. The song was included in the compilation album Greatest Hits (2002), whose tracks were selected by fans through a survey. The accompanying music video of \"Hunter\" was directed by longtime collaborator Paul White of Me Company and consists of a close-up of a bald Bj\u00F6rk as she transforms into an \"techno-bear\" while singing. Seeking to convey the music's fusion of organic and technological, the polar bear was animated in a non-naturalistic fashion; the bear also embodies the ferocious hunter the lyrics represent. The song's video garnered acclaim from critics. Bj\u00F6rk has performed \"Hunter\" on Later... with Jools Holland and in five of her tours, the most recent being the Vulnicura Tour."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"Isolation\" is a song written and performed by Alter Bridge, released as the first single from their third album, AB III, and is their most successful single to date. It was made available as a digital download on September 26, 2010 in the United Kingdom by Roadrunner Records and October 25, 2010 in the United States by Alter Bridge Recordings via Capitol Records. Musically, \"Isolation\" is heavy and aggressive, featuring the band's hard rock style while retaining a catchy, melodic chorus and incorporating elements of alternative metal and speed metal. The lyrics explore metaphorically isolating oneself from faith and belief, a common theme throughout the record. A music video for the song was released on December 6, 2010. The song impressed music critics and debuted at No. 34 on Billboard's Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks in October, though the single was originally only released in Britain. Several active rock radio stations in the United States put the song in regular rotation several weeks before its U.S. release. In the U.S., it initially became the most-added song on active rock radio and the 21st most-played active rock radio single, with the fastest increase in rotations out of any rock song at the time. In January, 2011 the song reached No. 1 on active rock radio, where it remained for five consecutive weeks, and spent seven weeks at No. 1 on the Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks chart, making it the band's first No. 1 single."@en ;

ns25:Childhood	rdf:type	dbo:MusicalWork ;
	dbo:abstract	"\"Scream\"/\"Childhood\" is the lead single from Michael Jackson's ninth studio album, HIStory: Past, Present and Future, Book I. The A-side of the single, \"Scream\", is a duet with his younger sister Janet Jackson, while the corresponding B-side, \"Childhood\", is a solo piece. The single was released on May 31, 1995. \"Scream\" is cited primarily as an aggressive, retaliatory song directed at the tabloid media and their coverage of the child sexual abuse accusations made against Michael Jackson in 1993. \"Scream\" was written, composed and produced by Jimmy Jam, Terry Lewis, Michael Jackson and Janet Jackson; Michael played many of the instruments. It incorporates elements of pop, R&B, electrorock, new jack swing, dance-pop, and funk. Recording for Scream took place at the Hit Factory in New York City in October 1994 and at Flyte Tyme Studios in Edina, Minnesota in December 1994. The song was leaked to radio stations early, despite Epic Records' attempt to keep it off air until the official release date. Generally well received amongst critics, it has been compared favorably to other accomplished pieces by Michael Jackson. It went on to be nominated for a Grammy Award and an American Music Award. The corresponding music video remains one of his most critically acclaimed pieces; it won numerous MTV Video Music Awards and a Grammy. At a cost of $7 million, it was listed in the Guinness World Records as the most expensive music video ever made; however, director Mark Romanek has refuted the claim, saying that there were two other music videos from the same era which cost \"millions more\" than the video for \"Scream\". The imagery in \"Scream\" has been replicated in several contemporary pieces, including \"No Scrubs\" (1999) by TLC, \"Shawty Get Loose\" (2008) by Lil Mama, \"Stay the Night\" (1999) by IMx, \"Walkin' on the Moon\" (2009) by The-Dream, and \"I'm Out\" by Ciara featuring Nicki Minaj (2013). \"Childhood\" is an auto-biographical song written and composed by Michael Jackson. The theme of the track centers around his difficult childhood experiences. It would become the main theme song for Free Willy 2: The Adventure Home, continuing his association with the Free Willy series. The track appeared on several compilation albums, but was met with a mixed reception amongst critics. The song's music video, which had little in common with the supporting film, has been critically praised. \"Scream\"/\"Childhood\" would become the first single in the 37-year history of Billboard to debut at number five on the Billboard Hot 100, where it peaked. It was a worldwide hit, reaching the top five in the vast majority of major music markets. Michael performed \"Scream\" on his 1996\u201397 HIStory World Tour. Following his death in 2009, Janet performed the song on her 2011 Number Ones: Up Close and Personal World Tour as a tribute to him as well as on her 2015-2016 Unbreakable World Tour."@en ;

The up-tempo electro-dance, techno synthpop song was written by Kelis and Jean Baptiste, and co-written and produced by David Guetta and El Tocadisco. It was released in October 2010, as the album's third single by will.i.am music, to coincide with the European leg of the Kelis' All Hearts tour. It was mainly met with positive reception from music critics, who praised the song's genre-shifting production and the empowering message in Kelis' lyrics. Described as a song which lends itself to live performances, \"Scream\" was compared[by whom?] to songs by Dutch disc-jockey Fedde Le Grand, although critics noted that Kelis' vocals were layered as opposed to sung. An accompanying music video was directed by Rankin, and features several different scenes based on fashion and colors. Kelis is seen in couture outfits and neon bodypaint, as well as running on a treadmill in a London estate. The video was also produced in digital 3-D. \"Scream\" was performed live on The Alan Titchmarsh Show and the Summer Sets concert series for Vevo. \"Scream\" became a minor hit in Belgium, where it reached top-twenty on the Flanders Ultratip chart."@en ;

The song charted moderately, possibly due in part to the continuing success of Timbaland's previous single \"Apologize\". It peaked within the top ten in countries like New Zealand and Sweden and in the top fifteen tier in countries like Australia and Ireland.

The song premiered on the internet on April 26, 2012, and was released the following day as a digital download. \"Scream\" is primarily a synthpop and dance-pop track, containing elements of ballads and soul. Critics compared its musical structure to that of Usher's 2010 single \"DJ Got Us Fallin' in Love\", which was also co-written by Martin, Kotecha, and Shellback. \"Scream\" was noted to contain heavily sexual overtones within its lyrics. \"Scream\" peaked at number nine on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart, and went on to sell more than one million copies in the country. It was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). The song peaked within the top five in several other countries, including Canada, Scotland, South Korea and the United Kingdom. It went on to be certified gold by the Bundesverband Musikindustrie (BVMI) and IFPI Denmark (IFPI) for shipments of 150,000 and 15,000 copies, respectively. The song received positive reviews from music critics, who praised its production, though some were ambivalent towards its originality.

The song title and lyrics refer two boys who are born and raised in two different areas, who play together in the streets with toy guns, but who grow up to live very different lives, with their childhood fun being nothing more than a memory. The song is based on the West and East sides of Melbourne, even though in later years the feud has died down. The video for the song was directed by Don Letts, (who also directed a number of The Clash's videos). It was filmed in London whilst the band was touring the UK. A crowd favourite, it is often played at the end of a show, most notably at Festival Hall in 2006. The song appears in the opening film clip for the PlayStation 2 video game World of Outlaws: Sprint Cars 2002."@en ;

Rebecca has taken over as the lead in the Marilyn Monroe musical Bombshell, while Karen is her understudy. However, Rebecca has taken Karen out for quite a bit of partying, which has caused tensions between Karen and Dev. During the meal, Rebecca and Dev start to argue about who is the one harming Karen. An uncomfortable Karen starts watching a Bollywood movie on one of the screens, and then imagines herself in a Bollywood-style movie with first Dev, then herself singing the song, with practically the entire rest of the main cast and various supporting players of the series performing as backup.

	dbo:abstract	"\"Butterfly\" is a song by American singer-songwriter Mariah Carey from her sixth studio album of the same name. It was released as the second single from the album on December 1, 1997 by Columbia Records. The song was written by Carey and Walter Afanasieff; both of them producing and arranging the song as well. \"Butterfly\" is a ballad combining elements of pop and gospel genres. Carey had originally conceived it as a house record with David Morales titled \"Fly Away (Butterfly Reprise)\". After realizing how personal the lyrics were and how they could be applied to Butterfly, she wrote the album's title track with Afanasieff. On the song's lyrics, Carey sings to someone, telling them to spread their wings and release into the world on their own, like a butterfly. The song's music video depicts Carey in an abandoned house, trapped in a desolate life. As the video progresses, she leaves, apparently for the first time in years, and runs into a nearby meadow. Towards the end, Carey jumps over a barbed fence and goes out into the world on a horse. The song's lyrics and video were directly connected to Carey's personal life at the time. \"Butterfly\" was performed live on the Late Show with David Letterman, Saturday Night Live and various European television programs. The song was also a permanent part of the set-list during her Butterfly World Tour during 1998. Due to current conflict with Columbia, \"Butterfly\" was never issued a commercial release, therefore hindering its charting ability. The song performed weakly on the charts, peaking outside the top twenty in most countries, except for New Zealand, where it peaked at number 15. In the United States, \"Butterfly\" was not eligible to chart on the Hot 100 due to Billboard rules at the time."@en ;

The song gained popularity outside of Sweden when it was included on the first version of Konami's music video game, Dance Dance Revolution and Dance Dance Revolution 3rdMix. In honor of its popularity, the song was remixed for the franchise's 2008 installment Dance Dance Revolution X, a mix primarily intended to celebrate the 10-year anniversary of the series. In 2009, the song was re-recorded with Veronica and Malin doing the vocals. This version was released as a single on May 13, 2009 and is called \"Butterfly '09 (United Forces Airplay Edit)\". The song is often incorrectly attributed to J-pop star Ayumi Hamasaki. This error may be due to the ambiency style, production and voice. Also, the voices of both singers are quite similar. The error may also be due to the song being incorrectly attributed to Ayumi Hamasaki and distributed via P2P networks in the late '90s. The song is also often mistakenly credited to Aqua, likely for the same reasons. South African band Die Antwoord sampled the song in their hit \"Enter the Ninja\" having heard it on Dance Dance Revolution X."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"Dance\" is a song by Filipino singer Nina from her 2011 studio album Stay Alive. It was initially released as the album's official lead single in August 2011, but was immediately pulled out of the radio after the album's release was postponed. In October 2011, the song was, again, released as a commercial single under Universal Records and received limited airplay. The song was originally written by Alexandra Prinz and Michael Gordon Lange, and it was produced by Ito Rapadas. The song talks about a woman who wants to get back together with her lover after breaking up with him. She misses her man, and is very undecided. She then goes to the club and dances her way to forgetting things and escaping loneliness. The single was accompanied by two different official music videos, both directed by Sean Lim. Version 2 was released in December 2011, and features Nina in Gaga-ish costumes, doing choreographed dance moves at the same time. Her co-Sessionista Duncan Ramos made a guest appearance in the video. Nina portrays a detective and an alien at the same time in the video, where she investigates a crime scene regarding alien abduction, when she is later revealed as the suspect alien. Despite the fact that two videos were filmed for the song, the other version was never released. She has performed the song live in Happy Yipee Yehey! and Party Pilipinas, where she also launched Stay Alive. \"Dance\" was well received by OPM critics, being given positive response by music reviewers. The Philippine Star described the song as an \"upbeat track with a catchy melody,\" while Philippine Entertainment Portal called it a \"fast track that fans will surely delight in.\" The song was given very limited commercial promotion, and its video was not played on myx until March 2012\u2014which led Nina's fans to questioning Universal's marketing strategy. The song will later be released internationally, alongside the album."@en ;

The original version contained many historic audio clips and samples. The remix does not have the audio clips and samples. \"Ghosts\" was written, composed and produced by Michael Jackson and Teddy Riley in 1997. Commentators made observations about the paranoid lyrics, a common theme in Jackson's work. The double A-side was promoted with a music video for each song. \"HIStory\" was set in a nightclub, in a futuristic era, and recalled Jackson's filmography. \"Ghosts\" was a five-minute clip taken from the much longer film of the same name. The song would become a top five hit in the UK and Italy, but did not chart as highly elsewhere."@en .

	dbo:abstract	"\"Halo\" is a song by American singer Beyonc\u00E9 from her third studio album I Am... Sasha Fierce (2008). Included on the I Am... disc, it was intended to give a behind-the-scenes glimpse of Beyonc\u00E9's life, stripped of her make-up and celebrity trappings. Columbia Records released the song, the album's fourth single, to mainstream radio in the United States on January 20, 2009, and to international markets from February 20. Inspired by Ray LaMontagne's 2004 song \"Shelter\", \"Halo\" was composed by Ryan Tedder, Evan Bogart and Beyonc\u00E9. It was conceived by Tedder specifically for Beyonc\u00E9, although there was media speculation that it had been intended for Leona Lewis. \"Halo\" is an pop power ballad, the lyrics of which describe a sublime love. It features drum, piano, keyboard, string, synthesizer, and percussion instrumentation. Kelly Clarkson claimed that Tedder reused the musical arrangement in her 2009 song \"Already Gone\". \"Halo\" received acclaim from music critics, who made comparisons with Lewis' 2007 song \"Bleeding Love\". Its production and Beyonc\u00E9's emotional vocals also received critical praise. \"Halo\" was nominated for Record of the Year and won Best Female Pop Vocal Performance at the 52nd Grammy Awards. It won Best Song at the 2009 MTV Europe Music Awards. \"Halo\" topped the singles charts of Brazil, Norway and Slovakia, and reached the top five on the singles chart of Australia, Germany, Ireland, Italy, New Zealand, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and the US. It was certified quintuple-platinum in Australia, and double-platinum in New Zealand, Spain and the US. Philip Andelman directed the ballad's accompanying music video, which features American actor Michael Ealy. It portrays a romantic relationship between Beyonc\u00E9's and Ealy's characters. Critics complimented Beyonc\u00E9's looks in the clip. An alternative music video, which shows Ealy's character being chased by police through a forest at night, was posted on the Internet in May 2010. The lyrics to \"Halo\" were changed for two of Beyonc\u00E9's special live performances: in a tribute to Michael Jackson following his death, and in a tribute to the victims of the 2010 Haiti earthquake. The song has been covered by many artists, including Florence and the Machine, Harper Blynn, Gary Lightbody, and Westlife. It was performed on the television show Glee, and was added to the international soundtrack of the Brazilian soap opera India \u2013 A Love Story."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"Hikari\" (Japanese: \u5149, \"light\") is a song recorded by Japanese recording artist and producer Utada Hikaru for her third studio album Deep River (2002). The song was written, produced and co-composed by Utada herself, while additional production was handled by long-term collaborators Akira Miyake and her father Teruzane Utada. \"Hikari\" was originally written and recorded for the video game Kingdom Hearts and was eventually added to the video game as the official theme song, while an English-language version \"Simple & Clean\" was used for the international editions. The single was then added to her studio album, along with her compilation album Utada Hikaru Single Collection Vol. 1 (2004). Musically, the songs are acoustic pop songs that utilize elements of pop music, rock music and electronic synthesizers and keyboards for instrumentation. Both version also received a remix that incorporated dance music that was used as the opening sequence for the video game. Lyrically, the songs discusses a relationship between the protagonist and the lover. Utada found it hard to write the theme song for the video game because she felt the concept and plot of the game was \"soulless\". Themes incorporated in the song include love, peace and the aftermath of it all. \"Hikari\" and \"Simple & Clean\" received favorable reception from most music critics, who had highlighted the track as an album standout and praised it for its simple production, vocal abilities and composition values. Critics also suggested it to be one of the best video game songs in recent history. Commercially, \"Hikari\" was a success in her native Japan, peaking at number one on the Oricon chart and was certified double platinum by the Recording Industry Association of Japan (RIAJ) for shipments of 500,000 units. It was the second consecutive number one single from the parent album. This became her first charting single off 2002 and her first single to chart at number one during that year. The accompanying music video was issued for the single as well, being directed by her then-husband Kazuaki Kiriya and featured Utada washing her dishes and drinking water in an kitchen area. The simplistic video was shot like this due to schedule conflicts between Utada and Kiriya, and managed to just record a video for this. The song has been performed on several of Utada's domestic and international tours including Utada United 2006 and Utada: In the Flesh 2010"@en ;

Andre also plays the guitar for the song, using the standard 12-bar blues. The song tells the story of a character wishing to gain his independence by leaving the familiarity of his family, friends and town. The video shows Andre and the band playing in an old house during a thunder storm, with people dancing around him. The building slowly fills with rain water, and by the end of the video, everything in the house is underwater. Because of the proximity in which the video was filmed, some viewers interpret the video to be a visual allusion to the New Orleans flooding following Hurricane Katrina, while others think the water represents the \"blues\" that can flood over someone's life.

The single topped the charts across Europe and in Australia, Canada, and the United States, where it spent one week at number one on the Billboard Hot 100, their last to do so, in May 1991. In the UK, \"Joyride\" peaked at #4. In interviews, Gessle states he got the idea for the opening line of this song from his girlfriend (now wife) who left a note on his piano that stated, \"Hello, you fool, I love you.\" In the opening section of the song, a man is heard saying \"Come on, join the joyride everybody, get your tickets here, step right this way\"; the man who says this is Roxette's old tour manager and long-time friend Dave Edwards. This is an homage to The Beatles' song \"Magical Mystery Tour\", on which, during the opening section, Paul McCartney is heard saying \"Roll up, roll up for the Magical Mystery Tour! Step right this way!\" In the liner notes of Don't Bore Us, Get to the Chorus!, Gessle calls \"Joyride\" Roxette's \"Magical Mystery Tour\", and says he took the title from an interview in which Paul McCartney called writing songs with John Lennon a \"long joyride\". In 1991, Alvin and the Chipmunks and The Chipettes covered the song for their album The Chipmunks Rock the House.

	dbo:abstract	"\"Last Friday Night (T.G.I.F.)\" is a song by American singer Katy Perry from her third studio album, Teenage Dream. The song was written and produced by Dr. Luke and Max Martin, who also co-wrote the song with Perry and Bonnie McKee. Perry stated that she was inspired to write the track after a night of wild partying and streaking. It was released as the album's fifth single on June 6, 2011, by Capitol Records, with a remix featuring American rapper Missy Elliott released to US radio stations and digital retailers on August 8, 2011; this version was included in Teenage Dream: The Complete Confection edition. It is a dance-pop song with lyrics about drunken fun and debauchery. Some of the risque lyrics in the song are often censored in radio versions of the song. The \"T.G.I.F.\" in the title is an acronym for \"Thank God It's Friday\". The song received mixed reviews from music critics, with some of them highlighting its playful and catchy nature. However, critics were divided regarding the song's lyrical content. The song had chart success worldwide, reaching number one in Slovakia and the Czech Republic, and has attained top-ten positions in Austria, Ireland, Italy, and Poland. By topping the US Billboard Hot 100, Perry became the first female solo artist to have five number-one singles on the Hot 100 from a single album; it also was Perry's sixth number-one single on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, and her fifth consecutive number one single. The single had sold 3.7 million digital copies in the US and was the tenth most played single on US radio during 2011. The song's accompanying music video was directed by Marc Klasfeld. The clip features Perry, as her teenage alter-ego Kathy Beth Terry, at a house party filled with music and dancing. While at the party, Terry is made over by her friend and draws attention to herself as the life of the party. The video features appearances by notable music artists and actors, which includes Rebecca Black, Corey Feldman, Debbie Gibson, Kenny G, Hanson, and Kevin McHale and Darren Criss of Glee. According to the director, the inspiration behind the video was Sixteen Candles, works by American filmmaker John Hughes, and other 1980s high school films. The music video won Favorite Music Video award at the 38th People's Choice Awards."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"Life\" was the Macedonia's entry in the Eurovision Song Contest 2004, performed in English (the first time the Macedonian entry had not featured at least some of the country's native language) by To\u0161e Proeski. A full Macedonian language version was recorded as \"Angel si ti\" and in the Macedonian national finals, all Proeski's songs were performed in Macedonian. Lyrically, the song is elliptical in meaning. Proeski sings about the need to make the most of life (\"Life is a book and you gotta read it/Life is a story and you gotta tell it\") and appears to be mourning the end of a relationship (\"Roaming through my old emotions/I find new feelings of misery\"). The song is well known for its unusual performance, which began with Proeski ostensibly alone on stage. As the opening bars of music were played, however, the arms of his backing dancers gradually engulfed him, eventually pulling him in various directions. This is to symbolise a confusion and turmoil. The arms have the same pattern sleeve as Proeski's jacket so that they look his own and symbolising that this suffering is possibly of his own mental doing. As Macedonia had not competed in the 2003 Contest, the song was first performed in the semi-final. Here, it was performed fifteenth (following Cyprus' Lisa Andreas with \"Stronger Every Minute\" and preceding Slovenia's Platin with \"Stay Forever\"). At the close of voting, it had received 71 points, placing 10th in the 22-strong field and just qualifying Macedonia for the final. In the final, it was performed fifteenth (following Russia's Yulia Savicheva with \"Believe Me\" and preceding Greece's Sakis Rouvas with \"Shake It\"). At the close of voting, it had received 47 points, placing 14th in a field of 24 and thus returning Macedonia to the semi-final at their next Contest appearance. It was succeeded as Macedonian representative at the 2005 Contest by Martin Vu\u010Di\u0107 with \"Make My Day\"."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"Numb\" is a song recorded by American singer Usher for his seventh studio album Looking 4 Myself (2012). Usher co-wrote it with Ryon Lovett and Terry Lewis, with production and additional writing provided by Swedish House Mafia, Alesso, and Klas \u00C5hlund. After their joint performance at the 2011 American Music Awards, Usher and Swedish House Mafia managed to start working on recording sessions for Usher's seventh studio album in Atlanta. RCA Records solicited \"Numb\" to contemporary hit radio stations on August 21, 2012 in the US as fourth single from the album. \"Numb\" is a dance-pop and electropop song with R&B elements which contains revolutionary pop music influences. Lyrically, it is \"an inspirational song about finding one\u2019s destiny, and becoming numb to the negativity and just following your dreams\". The song received generally positive acclaim from contemporary music critics with many of them praising its club-oriented production. \"Numb\" was a moderate worldwide success and reached the top-forty in five countries including Belgium, Germany and Australia. American directors Chris Applebaum and Grace Harry shot the music video for \"Numb\"; it premiered October 11, 2012 on Usher's Vevo channel. It represents footage of Usher's life in the near past and features several dramatic scenes of him including taking care of his sons, standing towards a microphone unable to perform and lying together with a sick woman in a hospital. Critics were divided on the video; although some of them praised the choreography, others criticized Usher's emotions. The singer performed the song during his American Express show on June 11, 2012 in London and at the 2012 American Music Awards."@en ;

The track is Suzuki's third single with Nakata after her August 2007 single's \"Free Free\" and \"Super Music Maker\". \"One\" premiered on June 18, 2008 as the lead single from the album. The CD and digital cover sleeve has Suzuki laying down on a mirror, with several strips of neon light behind her. The DVD cover sleeve features Suzuki kneeling down in front of a wall of neon lights. Musically, the track was described as a dance and club song. The lyrics to \"One\" describes Suzuki's celebration of her career and music; it also emphasizes minor themes of love, happiness, partying, and relationships. Upon its release, \"One\" garnered positive reviews from music critics and was praised for its composition and commercial appeal. It also achieved lukewarm success in Japan, peaking at number 17 on the Japanese Oricon Singles Chart and 47 on the Billboard Japan Hot 100 chart. As of March 2016, \"One\" has sold over eight thousand units in Japan alone. The accompanying music video for \"One\" was shot in Tokyo; it features Suzuki inside of a club, surrounded by LED lamps and several club poles. The music video became notable for displaying another change in Suzuki's persona and is cited as an example of her numerous \"reinventions\". For additional promotion, the song was featured on Suzuki's One Promotional Tour, and at her 29th birthday event."@en ;

The song is one of the band's most popular pieces and has remained a live staple since the release of the album, making this the most played song from the album ...And Justice for All. A video for the song was introduced in January 1989 on MTV. It portrays a World War I soldier who is severely wounded\u2014blind and unable to speak nor move\u2014returned home as a supposed vegetable case to wait helplessly for death. His only hope is to devise a way to communicate with the hospital staff. Shot in black and white by director Michael Salomon, the video's story is intercut with scenes taken from the 1971 anti-war film Johnny Got His Gun. Due to routinely being required to pay royalty fees to continue showing the music video, Metallica bought the rights to the film. The video was ranked No. 1 on MTV soon after its introduction."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"One\" is a song by the Irish rock band U2. It is the third track from their 1991 album Achtung Baby, and it was released as the record's third single in March 1992. During the album's recording sessions at Hansa Studios in Berlin, conflict arose between the band members over the direction of U2's sound and the quality of their material. Tensions almost prompted the band to break up until they achieved a breakthrough with the improvisation of \"One\"; the song was written after the band members were inspired by a chord progression that guitarist the Edge was playing in the studio. The lyrics, written by lead singer Bono, were inspired by the band members' fractured relationships and the German reunification. Although the lyrics ostensibly describe \"disunity\", they have been interpreted in other ways. \"One\" was released as a benefit single, with proceeds going towards AIDS research. The song topped the Irish Singles Charts and US Billboard Album Rock Tracks and Modern Rock Tracks charts, and it peaked at number seven on the UK Singles Chart and number ten on the Billboard Hot 100. In promotion of the song, the band filmed several music videos, although they were not pleased until a third was created. The song was acclaimed by critics upon its release, and it has since been featured in polls of the greatest songs of all time. U2 has performed \"One\" at all but one of their tour concerts since the song's live debut in 1992, and it has appeared in many of the band's concert films. In a live setting, \"One\" is often used by the group to promote human rights or social justice causes, and the song lends its namesake to Bono's charitable organisation, the ONE Campaign. In 2005, U2 re-recorded the song as part of a duet with R&B recording artist Mary J. Blige on her album The Breakthrough."@en ;

In the United States, the song peaked at number one on Billboard's Bubbling Under Hot 100 Singles for three weeks.

	dbo:abstract	"\"Overdose\" is a song recorded by American singer Ciara for her self-titled fifth studio album (2013). It was written by Josh Abraham, Oliver Goldstein, Ali Tamposi, Olivia Waithe and Ciara, while its production was handled by the former two. Ciara and Kuk Harrell were responsible for the song's vocal production. Notable for its shift from her more contemporary R&B sound towards a predominantly pop-orientated vocal style for the singer, \"Overdose\" served as a product of Ciara's experimentation and was recognized as the purest pop track on Ciara. An uptempo dance-pop, electropop and nu-disco song, its \"club-friendly\" production comprises rupturing synths and gritty, automatic beats. Its lyrical content act as an ode to codependency and are based on the subject of unhealthy infatuation. \"Overdose\" initially leaked as an extended snippet on July 17, 2012, and then in full in June 2013. The song was originally recognized as a \"fan favorite\", before garnering favorable reviews from music critics, some of which went on to publish campaigns for the track be released as a single. Its accompanying artwork features Ciara's then-fianc\u00E9 Future and resulted in widespread media attention for its provocative imagery. Though the song impacted urban contemporary and rhythmic contemporary radio in the United States\u2014on September 18 and October 15, 2013, respectively\u2014it failed to receive a full-scale single release, when its digital release was later cancelled and its accompanying music video and promotional performances failed to materialize.

It features guest vocals from American rapper Andr\u00E9 3000, and was released by Columbia Records as the third single from 4 on August 30, 2011. The song was written by Kanye West, Jeff Bhasker, Beyonc\u00E9, Dexter Mills, Douglas Davis and Ricky Walters and produced by Beyonc\u00E9 and West and co-produced by Bhasker. A midtempo R&B song, \"Party\" exhibits elements of the 1980s funk and soul music, and samples the 1985 song \"La Di Da Di\". It recalls the work of New Edition and Prince, among others. Built on a 808-retro beat, multi-tracked harmonies, and a smooth groove, the song's instrumentation includes slow-bouncing synthesizers, keyboard tones, and drums. Lyrically, \"Party\" gives ode to political themes such as feminism and sexual empowerment. In his rap verses, Andr\u00E9 3000 references milk and gets philosophical about his own career. \"Party\" was nominated for Best Rap/Sung Collaboration at the 54th Grammy Awards. \"Party\" was acclaimed by contemporary music critics, who praised Andr\u00E9 3000's verses, as well as the production handled by West and Beyonc\u00E9's emphatic, yet sensual vocals. Following the release of 4, \"Party\" charted at number 19 on the South Korea Gaon International Singles Chart. It debuted on the US Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart in July 2011, and peaked at number 2 on the chart for three consecutive weeks.

	dbo:abstract	"\"Passion\" is a song recorded by Japanese recording artist and songwriter Utada Hikaru for her fourth studio album Ultra Blue (2004). The song was used as the theme song for the 2005 video game Kingdom Hearts II. The song was written, composed and produced by Utada herself, while additional production was handled by Teruzane Utada and Akira Miyake. Utada had written and composed the song when she was approached to record another song for the Kingdom Hearts series, which she had contributed previously on the first video game. It also made an appearance on her 2010 greatest hits compilations: Utada Hikaru Single Collection Vol. 2 and Utada the Best. Spoken in both English and Japanese language, the lyrical content depicts the events of past, present and future and incorporates themes of love, hope and safety; When she accepted the offer to record the track, she found it difficult to write a Japanese-worded version of the \"Sanctuary\". \"Passion\" and \"Sanctuary\" received critical praise from contemporary music critics, who found it her most experimental track to date. Critics praised her vocal delivery and commended the production values, in contrast on her 2009 album This Is the One. Commercially, \"Passion\" had suffered in Japan for being Utada's first Japanese single to miss the top spot on the Oricon chart. The song peaked at number four on the Japanese Oricon Singles, her lowest charting single and her first single to miss the top three position, but eventually tied with her 2006 single \"Boku wa Kuma\". The accompanying music video for the single \"Passion\" was issued for the single as well, directed by Kazuaki Kiriya. The video features scenes of anime culture that represents the image of Utada herself and features Utada in a grand hall, shot all by green screening effects and finishes with a paddock of running horses. During production, Utada had compared the video, choreography and set to 1997 animated action-fantasy film Princess Mononoke. The video was positively received by critics for its comparison sets to the video game, but received minor criticism for the lack of video game inspiration and footage."@en ;

The song features additional vocals by soul singer Dwele and is co-produced by West and Symbolyc One. It is built around samples of \"21st Century Schizoid Man\" by King Crimson, \"Afromerica\" by Continent Number 6, and \"It's Your Thing\" by Cold Grits. After having recorded it in Hawaii, West reported that he spent 5000 hours composing \"Power\". In its lyrics, West comments about the United States and his critics. Its chorus features an abrasive vocal-riff. \"POWER\" was West's comeback single following his 2008 album 808s & Heartbreak and his controversial incident with Taylor Swift at the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards. The song received acclaim from music critics and it was listed amongst the best tracks of 2010 by several publications, including Time, Pitchfork Media, Spin, and Rolling Stone. Critics described it as a return to form for West, praising its intricate production, lyrical merit, and scope. It was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Rap Solo Performance at the 53rd Grammy Awards. The song debuted on the Billboard Hot 100 at position 22 and thereafter declined. The track was promoted by a music video, which was directed by Marco Brambilla. The video features a long take of the camera pulling away from West.

West performed the song on Saturday Night Live, at the 2010 BET Awards, at the 2011 Coachella Music Festival, and his Watch the Throne Tour.

It was the fifth and final single released from her multi-platinum soundtrack The Bodyguard, and it is played during the closing credits of the film. \"Queen of the Night\" is an uptempo pop rock/dance number, with Houston expressing how she \"rules the club scene\", proclaiming herself \"queen of the night\". It was not released as a single in America, but it received such substantial radio play that it rose to number 36 on the Hot 100 Airplay. However, because of Billboard magazine rules at the time (which have since been modified), a song with no commercial single available could not chart on the main Billboard Hot 100. The song reached number 1 on the Billboard Hot Dance Club Play chart, becoming Houston's fifth number 1 dance single. It was released in several other countries, peaking at number 14 in the UK. The music video for \"Queen of the Night\" is the full performance Houston gives in the motion picture The Bodyguard. In the film, the performance is interrupted by violence. In live performances by Houston, the song's arrangement was faithful to the 1993 CJ Mackintosh remix, which was used during Houston's 1993-94 The Bodyguard World Tour and also for her performance at the 1994 Soul Train Music Awards."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"Revolution\" is a song by the Beatles, written by John Lennon and credited to Lennon\u2013McCartney. Two versions of the song were recorded in 1968: a hard rock version, released as the B-side of the \"Hey Jude\" single, and a slower, bluesier arrangement (titled \"Revolution 1\") for the Beatles' self-titled double album, commonly known as \"the White Album\". Although the single version was issued first, it was recorded several weeks after \"Revolution 1\", as a re-make specifically intended for release as a single. A third connected piece, written by Lennon, is the experimental track \"Revolution 9\", based the latter parts of the same performance that produced \"Revolution 1\", and which also appears on the White Album. Inspired by political protests in early 1968, Lennon's lyrics expressed doubt in regard to some of the tactics. When the single version was released in August, the political left viewed it as betraying their cause. The release of the album version in November indicated Lennon's uncertainty about destructive change, with the phrase \"count me out\" recorded differently as \"count me out, in\". In 1987, the song became the first Beatles recording to be licensed for a television commercial, which prompted a lawsuit from the surviving members of the group. In the same year Nina Simone recorded her single Revolution with some structural similarities (some lyrics are also the same) to the Beatles' song, but credited to her and Weldon Irvine."@en ;

Additionally, it also reached the top five in most international charts, including France, Germany, Italy, Japan and Switzerland. To promote the song, Perry performed under the Brooklyn Bridge at the closing ceremony of the 2013 MTV Video Music Awards, on The X Factor Australia, at the Sydney Opera House in late October 2013, and on the German TV show Schlag den Raab. Grady Hall and Mark Kudsi directed the song's music video, which features Perry trying to adapt to the jungle where she survived a plane crash, and taming a tiger.

Sensitive, on which the band's sound verged on shoegazing, has been described as \"an anthemic statement of purpose...a defence of feeling...and a comment on the way sensitivity is criticized, or punished even\". The single reached number 12 in the UK Independent Chart in March that year. \"Sensitive\" was also voted at number 26 in the 1989 Festive 50. Both tracks from the single were later included on the CD reissue of the band's debut mini-album Snowball."@en ;

The original lyrics to \"Shine\" were much darker. Mark Holden was responsible for the success of her song \"Shine\", which Amorosi wrote for a friend from high school who committed suicide.Amorosi says: \"Mark changed a line in it. He said the song didn't work, or that one particular line in it didn't work. The line went 'Everyone you see, everyone you know is gonna die' and he didn't like the word 'die'. He thought it was just wrong. We were all sitting around trying to find a substitute, and we were all stuck on the word 'try'. But Mark came up with the idea of changing it to 'shine' and it all came together.That's Mark's magic. He has a great ear for music. He knows exactly what makes a hit.I think it was a good outcome, because something that was tragic became positive, but... I could never go back to changing it to 'die' now. It is what it is. A lot of my music on The Power was very personal, because I suppose that's what sets me apart from the other songwriters. I'm very blunt and honest with melodies and lyrics. I like to get straight to the point. So I think with \"Shine\" I tried to make it uplifting but it was very, very personal - and quite an upsetting song.\" The song \"Shine\" was adopted by Ansett Airlines for their final advertising campaign before the company went bankrupt and had to shut down. \u201CI jinxed them with my song!\" Amorosi said. \"That was heartbreaking, actually.

It was subsequently released as a CD and 7\" vinyl single in the UK on the 5 March 2007. The song was written by Nic to comfort his family after his father's death. He is quoted as saying \"It was inevitable I would write a song that dealt with all of that, but it was almost too big a subject for me to handle,\" Nic also says. \"Then I got a phone call from my mum saying everyone was depressed so I wrote the song through Dad's eyes, what he would say to help everyone through. We recorded it in one take, but it was emotional, very heavy. We couldn't be happier with this album.\" The title of the song is speculated to be in homage to \"Shine On You Crazy Diamond\", a similarly themed song by Pink Floyd, though this has not been confirmed. Similarly, the refrain of \"Shine on, for everyone\" is reminiscent of \"Instant Karma!\", a song by John Lennon. The song was featured on the final episode of the television series The O.C. and also in a season final episode of Cold Case. The song was also in a first season episode of Brothers & Sisters. In a recent interview with Heat magazine, the comedy chathost declared, \"I love this song. I would be more than delighted to hear it through my coffin!\"[citation needed] The song charted poorly in Australia only reaching #54 on the singles charts, similarly in the UK it only reached #114.

The song is a power pop and pop punk track, which lyrically, tells a story told from the singer's viewpoint about her rocker boyfriend and a girl he knew in high school who rejected him because he was a skateboarder and she was a snob. The song received critical appreciation, with most commending its hook, calling the song \"funny\" and \"clever\". It also received a Grammy nomination for Best Female Rock Vocal Performance at the 2003 edition. Commercially, \"Sk8er Boi\" was a success, reaching the top-ten in more than ten countries, such as Australia, New Zealand, the United Kingdom and the United States (becoming Lavigne's second top ten single on the Billboard Hot 100 chart). The music video for the song, directed by Francis Lawrence, features a concert on a city street with Lavigne singing on the hood of a car with a crowd rocking out around her. It was a success on TRL and was voted one of the best music videos of the decade by BT TV. The song was featured in all of the concerts and tours held by Lavigne, since her first, \"Try to Shut Me Up Tour\" (2002-2003) until her latest, \"The Avril Lavigne Tour\" (2013-2014)."@en ;

The song served as the album's second single on July 10, 2007 through 19 Recordings and RCA Records. Clarkson wrote it after her friend Calamity McEntire, who receives a songwriting credit, gave her the line \"pick her weeds and keep the flowers\", with additional writing by Aben Eubanks and Jimmy Messer, production by David Kahne, and co-production by Messer and Jason Halbert. \"Sober\" is an alternative rock song, with lyrics that use addiction as a metaphor for a relationship, evolving around the line \"Three months and I'm still sober\". Upon its release, \"Sober\" was met with positive reviews from music critics, who considered it to be the musical highlight of My December. Clarkson's vocal performance and song's production received particular praise. Commercially, \"Sober\" failed to make an impact, charting at number 93 on Billboard's Pop 100 component chart, based on airplay on mainstream top 40 radio stations and digital downloads, and at number 10 on Bubbling Under Hot 100 Singles. No accompanying music video was recorded for the song; however, Clarkson promoted it through several live appearances, including at Live Earth and The Tonight Show with Jay Leno."@en ;

EscXtra praised the production : \"this mix has given added strength to this track (...) so it would fit with the whole album.\" However the same critic criticized the vocal editing: \"the effect of her voice delivering the lyrics is a little compromised compared to how it used to sound.

The song was released as the album's second single on October 31, 2008, firstly through digital download and later was added to U.S. radio stations on December 1, 2008. The power pop song talks about the quiet sense of comfort in being sober, with the singer claiming it was about the vices that we choose. The song received generally favorable reviews from music critics, who commended the track for being a heartfelt track, with some praising its lyrical content. However, few critics dismissed the track, calling it \"more of the same\" from her previous music. Furthermore, the song received a Grammy Award for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance in 2010. Commercially, \"Sober\" attained success on the charts, reaching the top-ten in over thirteen countries, while reaching the top-twenty in the U.S., as well as the top of Billboard's Adult Top 40 chart.

	dbo:abstract	"Sonnet is a song by Britpop band The Verve and is featured on their third album, Urban Hymns. It was released 2 March 1998 as the final single from the album (see 1998 in British music). The song has the same instrumental layout as \"The Drugs Don't Work\", consisting of acoustic and electric guitars backed up with a string section which is mainly made up of violins. At the start of 1998, Hut asked The Verve to put out another single from the album, an idea which the band disagreed with. Unusually, Hut pressed them on this matter, and so the band finally agreed to release \"Sonnet\", but only in a format that would make it ineligible for chart recognition. Consequently, \"Sonnet\" was released as part of a set of four 12-inch records (backed by \"Stamped\", \"So Sister\" and \"Echo Bass\"). The release was limited to just 5000 copies, despite the huge radio coverage it received, and the official chart refused to recognize it as a single because of the extra content, as planned. The pack was released in a cardboard mailer, and the preceding three singles from the album, all re-released on the same day, fitted into the mailer. However, sales of an imported format resulted in it charting in the UK at #74. In Australia, \"Sonnet\" peaked at #83 on the ARIA singles chart in January 1999. \"Sonnet\" appeared on the MTV animated series Daria in the first episode of the third season, when she starts thinking about using contact lenses."@en ;

I've waited here for you for so very long.\" \"Stillborn\" tells the story of a man whose girlfriend treats him so poorly and takes so much advantage of him that his love for her dies, leaving him feeling dead as well. Wylde insists that it is not autobiographical and that if any girl were to treat him like that, he would simply break up with her. The video was directed by Rob Zombie, featuring his signature style of blue lighting, zombies, and a regular female cameo, Rob Zombie's wife Sheri Moon Zombie. The idea came together while touring together on Ozzfest. Wylde has performed an acoustic version of \"Stillborn\" that is not only longer but also features a much different sound, following an acoustic solo throughout much of song.

Lead vocalist Bono described the song as \"the sound of four men chopping down The Joshua Tree,\" due to its departure from the traditional sound that had characterised the band in the 1980s. Bono described the song's subject as that of a phone call from someone in Hell who enjoys being there and telling the person on the other end of the line what he has learned. The lyrics are written as a series of aphorisms that Bono collected during the album's recording. The song and its video were also a showcase for \"The Fly,\" a persona that Bono adopted for the Zoo TV Tour, in which he played the part of a stereotypical leather-clad rock star known for wearing large wrap-around sunglasses and strutting around the stage. The song became the band's second number-one single in the UK and was successful among alternative rock radio audiences."@en ;

Following on the heels of the band's global #1, \"Do You Really Want to Hurt Me\", \"Time (Clock of the Heart)\" peaked at number three on the UK Singles Chart, selling over 500,000 copies in the UK. In the United States, the song matched the #2 peak of its predecessor on the Billboard Hot 100, kept from #1 by \"Flashdance... What a Feeling\" by Irene Cara. In Europe and United Kingdom, it was a stand-alone single, released in November 1982. For this market, its first inclusion on a Culture Club album was on their 1987 compilation, called This Time: The First Four Years. In a retrospective review of the song, Allmusic journalist Stewart Mason wrote: \"Of all of Culture Club's early hits, Time (Clock of the Heart) has probably aged the best. Boy George drops the cryptic self-mythology long enough to deliver a tender, heartfelt lyric on lost love.\" The music video has been released in two versions. The only difference was a scene where the group is watching TV, along with vocalist Helen Terry. In one version, a Christmas tree is shown. In the other, the tree is removed. This was because of the date of release for certain markets. The \"Christmas\" version (which is on the 2005 DVD \"Greatest Hits\"), was for European countries and the \"regular version\" was for the other markets, where the song was released in spring 1983. The US single was released with the B-side being an instrumental version of the song called \"Romance Beyond the Alphabet\", which not only removed the vocals but at least one layer of melody as well."@en ;

It is the final Pink Floyd song credited to all four members and the last to feature Richard Wright on lead vocals until \"Wearing the Inside Out\" on The Division Bell. This song is about how time can slip by, but many people do not realise it until it is too late. Roger Waters got the idea when he realised he was no longer preparing for anything in life, but was right in the middle of it. He has described this realisation taking place at ages 28 and 29 in various interviews. It is noted for its long introductory passage of clocks chiming and alarms ringing, recorded as a quadrophonic test by Alan Parsons, not specifically for the album."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"Tour de France\" is a song by Kraftwerk. It was first issued in June 1983, peaking at number 22 in the UK singles chart. It is notable for the use of sampled voices and mechanical sounds associated with cycling that were used to supplement a simple electro-percussion pattern \u2013 an approach Kraftwerk had used on earlier tracks such as \"Metal on Metal\" (from Trans-Europe Express) and \"Numbers\" (from Computer World). The music is credited to Ralf H\u00FCtter, Florian Schneider and Karl Bartos; the lyrics are credited to Ralf H\u00FCtter and Maxime Schmitt, a French label associate of the band. The melody appears to quote a fragment of the opening section of Paul Hindemith's \u201CSonata for Flute and Piano\u201D (\u201CHeiter Bewegt\u201D). For Kraftwerk, \"Tour de France\" was a departure from the technological tone of the two previous albums, The Man-Machine and Computer World. Instead, the song is a joie de vivre celebration of cycling, marking the group's increasing interest in the sport. Of the current line-up, Ralf H\u00FCtter and Fritz Hilpert have been known to take part in cycling events. The track was originally recorded with the intention of being included on the subsequently abandoned Techno Pop album. The single was originally released on seven and twelve inch vinyl, and as a cassette-single. It has the most complicated set of variants of any Kraftwerk song, having been variously edited and remixed to the point that there is no completely definitive version. The sleeve design depicted the band on road bikes in a paceline, superimposed across an angled representation of the French national flag. The design was adapted from an image that had appeared on a 1953 Hungarian postage stamp, one of a sport-themed set commemorating the opening the N\u00E9pstadion (People's Stadium) in Budapest. The piece was also included in the 1984 film Breakin', also known as Breakdance internationally. Although the song did appear briefly in the film, Kraftwerk did not let the song appear on the movie soundtrack; instead, a cover version of the song was released by a group called \"10 Speed\"."@en ;

The song had significant airplay and MTV rotation and reached #5 on the Billboard Mainstream Rock Tracks chart, making it Megadeth's most successful single to date followed by \"Breadline\" and \"Crush 'Em\" from their follow-up album Risk, both of which reached #6 in the same charts. It was later included on the three compilation albums, Capitol Punishment, Back to the Start and Anthology: Set the World Afire, and the box set Warchest. The song tells the story of relationships that have failed due to mutual dishonesty. The song was nominated for a Grammy award in January 1998 for best heavy metal performance. Also, the song's closest competitor on the Billboard 200 of Hard rock was Metallica's \"Bleeding Me\" (1996-97). A \"Spanish\" version of the song was used as a bonus track on the Latin American edition of Cryptic Writings and later on the international remaster of the album. However only the chorus is in Spanish. The song is otherwise identical to its album counterpart in verse. Mustaine would record a Spanish version of The World Needs A Hero song Promises a few years later, which also appeared on the Latin American version of its parent album. An instrumental version was released for Extreme Championship Wrestling performer Jerry Lynn and was later issued on ECW: Extreme Music compilation. The drum intro of the song is currently played right before kickoffs during each home game played by the Arizona State Sun Devils.

	dbo:abstract	"\"Viva Forever\" is a song by the Spice Girls from their second album, Spiceworld. Originally set to be released alongside the track \"Never Give Up on the Good Times\" the double A-Side was then pulled as member Geri Halliwell left the group. The song was released on 20 July 1998 in the United Kingdom and gained positive reviews from critics. The song also charted fairly well becoming the band\u2019s seventh UK number one single gaining a Platinum certification whilst also topping the charts in New Zealand. The single was a commercial success despite the poor promotion. An accompanying music video directed by Steve Box was released featuring the five band members as animated fairies that interact with two friends in a forest. The four remaining members performed the track on shows Top of the Pops and on the National Lottery television show. An adapted duet version was performed with Pavarotti at his annual charity event Pavarotti and Friends. The song was also performed live as a five-piece on their return concert tour, Return of the Spice Girls. \"Viva Forever\" is widely considered as the best work of the Spice Girls in their career. In the book \"The Spice Girls Revisited\" by David Sinclair it was confirmed by the co-writers/producers of the song Matthew Rowe & Richard Stannard that Geri Halliwell was the main songwriter of \"Viva Forever\"."@en ;

The lyrics to the song contain historical and Christian references, and the track is built around a repeating string section in unison with a digital processed piano with a timpani background. The song was released on 13 June 2008 as the album's second single, debuting to critical acclaim and commercial success. \"Viva la Vida\" reached the top spot of the UK Singles Chart and Billboard Hot 100, becoming the band's first number-one single in both the US and UK. The song won the Grammy Award for Song of the Year at the 51st Grammy Awards in 2009. The song became the sixth song to reach the 4 million mark in paid downloads in the United States.

	dbo:abstract	"\"Wanted Dead or Alive\" is a song from Bon Jovi's 1986 album Slippery When Wet. The song was written by Jon Bon Jovi and Richie Sambora and was released in 1987 as the album's third single. During a February 20, 2008 encore performance in Detroit Michigan Jon Bon Jovi told the crowd about running into Bob Seger at a Pistons game. As he introduced his song \"Wanted Dead or Alive\", he said it was inspired by Seger's \"Turn the Page\" hit and called the song the band's anthem. The song peaked at #7 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart and #13 on the Mainstream Rock Tracks chart, making it the third single from the album to reach the Top 10 of the Hot 100. As a result, Slippery When Wet became the first hard rock album to have 3 top 10 hits on the Billboard Hot 100. In 2001 a live version from the album One Wild Night Live 1985\u20132001 was released as a single featuring a promotional music video. In 2003 a new version was released on the album This Left Feels Right and this version was also released as a single with a promotional video. Now considered one of the band's signature songs, it has become known to younger audiences as the theme song for Discovery Channel's Deadliest Catch TV show. The song was certified quadruple platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America in 2015."@en ;

dbr:Warped	rdf:type	dbo:MusicalWork ;
	dbo:abstract	"\"Warped\" is a song by the American alternative rock group Red Hot Chili Peppers, from their 1995 album, One Hot Minute. It was released as the first single from the album. It is the first track on One Hot Minute, beginning with an unusually quiet intro, before suddenly kicking into a very heavy, crunching riff, and ends with a mellow, melodic outro. Vocalist Anthony Kiedis' vocals are distorted and echoed throughout, and contrast dramatically with the rapping present on the band's previous material, especially on their more fast-paced songs such as this; short lines are stretched to fill an entire measure. The musical style is of an unpredictable and unsettling nature, which is generally maintained throughout the entire album. The lyrics describe Kiedis' confused feelings about drugs, starting already in the first lines with: \"my tendency/for dependency/is offending me\". Despite being the album's first single, neither the song nor the accompanying video was included on the Red Hot Chili Peppers' Greatest Hits compilation. The B-side \"Melancholy Mechanics\" also appears on the soundtrack to the 1996 movie, Twister, as well as on the Japanese pressing of One Hot Minute. During live performances of \"Warped\", the band sometimes played a sample of the song \"Three Days\" by Jane's Addiction (former band of then-guitarist Dave Navarro) at the end of the song. This song made its live debut at the Woodstock Festival in 1994, although with much different lyrics. Like the majority of songs from One Hot Minute, it has not been played live since 1996."@en ;

It is the fifth song and lead single from the band's ninth studio album, Murder Ballads (1996), released on Mute Records. It was written by the band's frontman Nick Cave and produced by Tony Cohen and Victor Van Vugt. The song received a positive reception from music critics and became the band's most successful single worldwide reaching No. 3 in Norway, the top five in Australia, and the top twenty in the United Kingdom, Ireland, Germany and New Zealand. It also received a limited promotional release in the United States. The song was certified Gold in Germany in 1996 for 250,000 copies sold, despite never reaching the top ten in that country. It charted again at the bottom of the German Top 100 in 2008 because of digital downloads after it was used in a soap opera. \"Where the Wild Roses Grow\" was also certified Gold in Australia for selling 50,000 copies. Cave was inspired to write \"Where the Wild Roses Grow\" after listening to the traditional song, \"Down in the Willow Garden\", a tale of a man courting a woman and killing her while they are out together. Cave arranged this tale as second of two B-sides, \"The Ballad of Robert Moore & Betty Coltrane\" / \"The Willow Garden\", released on the CD-Maxi single version. Although the song does not feature on a Minogue studio album, it can be found on her compilations Hits+, Greatest Hits 1987\u20131999, Ultimate Kylie and The Abbey Road Sessions. Minogue performed a chorus of the song during her Showgirl and Homecoming tours. It reached number 8 in Triple J's Hottest 100 1995.

Columbia Records released the song as the lead contemporary hit radio single from the album in the US and Italy on December 16, 2013. Ryan Tedder co-wrote and co-produced \"XO\" with Terius \"The-Dream\" Nash and Beyonc\u00E9, with additional production handled by Chauncey \"Hit-Boy\" Hollis and HazeBanga Music. A pure midtempo pop love song, \"XO\" is complete with electronic musical instrumentation, synthesizers and drums. Musically, it was compared to Beyonc\u00E9's own song \"Halo\" and was noted for having several music hooks including its call and response chorus. Upon its release, \"XO\" was acclaimed by music critics, who praised the singer's raw and low vocals and applauded the song for its pop appeal; many of them further hailed it as a highlight of the album. However, the usage of an audio sample from Space Shuttle Challenger disaster at the beginning of the song was criticized by the families of the lost crew, NASA, and some media. Beyonc\u00E9 released a statement saying that the song was intended to help people who have lost loved people in their lives and that the sample was included as a tribute to the Challenger crew. \"XO\" managed to appear on many music charts across Europe and Oceania and it peaked at number 45 on the US Billboard Hot 100. A music video for the song directed by Terry Richardson was filmed in Coney Island in late August 2013. It was made available on iTunes with the release of the album on December 13, 2013 and was released online three days later. It received positive reviews from critics who described it as a suitable accompaniment for the song, praising its positive atmosphere. Beyonc\u00E9 performed the song during the last stops of the North American leg of The Mrs. Carter Show World Tour in December 2013 and later during the tour's second European leg in early 2014. To further promote \"XO\", she performed it at the 2014 BRIT Awards and later at the 2014 MTV Video Music Awards.

	dbo:abstract	"\"Afrodisiac\" is a song by American recording artist Brandy Norwood. It was written by Isaac Phillips, Kenisha Pratt, Kenneth Pratt and Timbaland for her same-titled fourth studio album (2004), with production was handled by the latter. One of the first songs Norwood and Timbaland collaborated on, the record is an uptempo\u2013offbeat contemporary R&B song with pop and dance-pop elements, built along on a flute, Afro-Caribbean music influences and 1980s electro sounds. Considered by Norwood as one of her favorites on the album, the track expresses a female's addictive passion for a special person, whom she declares her very own aphrodisiac. The song was met with generally positive reviews from contemporary critics. Many praised Norwood's versatility and considered it as one of the stand-out tracks on Afrodisiac for having an innovative and different production when compared to the others. Released as the album's second international single in Europe and Oceania during the third and fourth quarter of 2004, \"Afrodisiac\" reached number eleven on the UK Singles Chart, its highest peak, as well as the top thirty in France and Ireland, and the top forty in Australia and Switzerland, where it surpassed the success of its predecessor. The single's music video was directed by Matthew Rolston and marked his second collaboration with Norwood following their 1995 video for \"Best Friend\". Choreographed by Laurieann Gibson, it was filmed in Los Angeles, California and features Norwood dancing in a water-flooded outtrack world, influenced by white, gold and black color. \"Afrodisiac\" was performed on a few television shows, such as CD:UK, Top of the Pops, and Billboard Live, but has since been performed frequently on one of Norwood's concerts and tours, including the 2004 MOBO Awards and the 2009 Human World Tour."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"Charmaine\" is a popular song written by Ern\u00F6 Rap\u00E9e and Lew Pollack. The song was written in 1926 and published in 1927. However, Desmond Carrington on his BBC Radio 2 programme marked the song's writing as being in 1913. The song was originally in waltz time, but later versions were in common time. The song was originally composed for the 1926 silent movie What Price Glory?, and most notably, the best-selling version, recorded by Guy Lombardo & his Orchestra, spent seven weeks at the #1 position in 1927. It was also featured in the movie Two Girls and a Sailor. It was recorded by the Harry James orchestra in 1944. An instrumental version arranged by Ronald Binge and performed by the Mantovani orchestra was his first hit on the United States charts in 1951. This recording was released by London Records as catalog number 1020. It first reached the Billboard charts on November 9, 1951 and lasted 19 weeks on the chart, peaking at #10. Another recording, by Gordon Jenkins' orchestra, with a vocal by Bob Carroll, also charted in 1951. This recording was released by Decca Records as catalog number 27859. It first reached the Billboard magazine charts on December 7, 1951 and lasted 1 week on the chart, at #26. The Bachelors' version reached #5 in the British charts in 1963. A 1952 arrangement of \"Charmaine\" by Billy May and His Orchestra reached # 17 on the Billboard charts. The single was May's biggest hit under his own name. \"Charmaine\" is one of many popular songs whose lyrics use a \"Bluebird of happiness\" as a symbol of cheer: \"I wonder, when bluebirds are mating, will you come back again?\""@en ;

The song charted within the top 20 in ten other countries, and gained greater significance due to its accompanying music video, which parodies and mocks the boy bands Backstreet Boys and 'N Sync. The video was popular in rotation on MTV's Total Request Live, leading to criticism from those who felt their basis for parody was thin. \"All the Small Things\" was selected by Rolling Stone as one of the \"100 Greatest Pop Songs\", and listed in the book 1001 Songs You Must Hear Before You Die."@en ;

It is an electropop song, featuring electronica, R&B and reggae influences. Lyrically, the song has a melancholic theme, detailing the demoralisation and rationalisation of alcoholism through the typical thought process of a \"party girl\". \"Chandelier\" received mainly favourable reviews from music critics, who praised Sia's songwriting and vocals. Commercially, the single attained widespread success, charting within the top five on record charts in 20 countries including France, Italy, Poland, Norway, Australia and New Zealand. In the United States, the single peaked at number 8 on the Billboard Hot 100, becoming Sia's first single as a lead artist to appear on the Hot 100, as well as her first top ten single as a lead artist on the chart, and has sold over 2 million copies in the country. The song received nominations at the 57th Grammy Awards for Song of the Year, Record of the Year and Best Pop Solo Performance, with its video receiving a nomination for Best Music Video. A music video for the song, directed by Sia and Daniel Askill, and choreographed by Ryan Heffington, features dancer Maddie Ziegler. It was well received and has been viewed on YouTube more than 1.1 billion times, becoming one of the most viewed YouTube videos ever posted. In support of the single and 1000 Forms of Fear, Sia, often with Ziegler, performed \"Chandelier\" on a number of television shows, including The Ellen DeGeneres Show, Late Night with Seth Meyers, Jimmy Kimmel Live! and Saturday Night Live, and at the Hollywood Bowl."@en ;

It was first released as a single in 1991, but did not become a hit until four years later, when the Los Angeles radio station KROQ began adding it into their playlists and it quickly became one of their most requested songs. Bradley Nowell explained, Humorous in tone, the song ends with the victimizer being sent to prison and being humiliatingly anally raped by a larger inmate. Although \"Date Rape\" is one of Sublime's most popular songs, it barely made it on their first CD. Nowell and the other members of the band thought of it as one of their worst songs. They were often reluctant to play it during live shows when fans screamed out requests for it. Pornographic actor Ron Jeremy stars in the \"Date Rape\" music video. Jeremy plays both the judge at the rape trial and the \"large inmate\" who rapes the man who sexually assaulted the female protagonist of the song. The song was covered by Fishbone (who Sublime cited as an influence) on the 2005 Sublime tribute album entitled Look at All the Love We Found for which a music video was directed by Renee Tod and Josh Fischel (of the band Bargain Music). Fischel is the director of the Sublime documentary Stories, Tales, Lies & Exaggerations. The song also appeared on Fishbone's 2006 album Still Stuck in Your Throat."@en ;

Spears first posted on her Twitter account a link to a clip of the song in February 2011, a month prior to the album's release. Following a poll on her official website, \"I Wanna Go\" was chosen as the third single of the album, and Jive Records released it on June 13, 2011. \"I Wanna Go\" is a dance-pop and Hi-NRG song that features a heavy bassline and drum fills reminiscent of English rock band New Order. The pre-chorus has a whistled hook that received comparisons to the music of Bob Sinclar and Frankie Knuckles. The lyrics of \"I Wanna Go\" feature Spears singing about losing inhibitions. The song received mixed to positive reviews from critics. Some praised it for being effective and highlighted its hook, while others dismissed the processed vocals. The song was treated with different remixes, including a Bollywood mix with guest vocals by Sonu Nigam and another one by DJ Frank E and Alex Dreamz. After the release of Femme Fatale, \"I Wanna Go\" charted due to digital sales in the upper end of the US Billboard Hot 100 and the Canadian Hot 100, and also topped the South Korean International chart. Following its release as a single, the song reached the top ten in several music markets, including Canada, France, Finland and the United States. However, it became one of her lowest peaking singles in countries such as Australia and New Zealand, and was the first single of her career that failed to chart inside the top 100 in the United Kingdom. In the United States, \"I Wanna Go\" made Femme Fatale the first album by Spears to have three top ten singles. An accompanying music video for the song, directed by Chris Marrs Piliero, premiered on June 22, 2011. It depicts Spears daydreaming at a press conference about a series of events, including being chased by paparazzi cyborgs and being rescued by actor Guillermo D\u00EDaz. Piliero described the video as \"a ridiculous, exaggerated rumor about her life and career\". The video references the films Half Baked, Crossroads, Terminator 2: Judgment Day and Michael Jackson's Thriller. It received positive reviews from critics, who praised its fun spirit. Spears has performed \"I Wanna Go\" on her Femme Fatale Tour (2011) and during her Las Vegas residency show Britney: Piece of Me (2013)."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"If I Were a Boy\" is a song performed by American singer and songwriter Beyonc\u00E9 from her third studio album I Am... Sasha Fierce (2008). It was written by BC Jean and Toby Gad, who also handled its production alongside Beyonc\u00E9. Inspired by the difficult break-up of a romantic relationship, the song was initially recorded by Jean, whose record company rejected it. Beyonc\u00E9 then recorded her own version. Jean was upset when she learned that Beyonc\u00E9 was releasing it as a single, but eventually they reached an agreement. \"If I Were a Boy\" was released by Columbia Records on October 12, 2008, as the album's lead single alongside \"Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)\". The two songs showcased the contrast between Beyonc\u00E9's personality and her aggressive onstage persona, Sasha Fierce. A Spanish version of the song, titled \"Si Yo Fuera un Chico\", was digitally released in Mexico and Spain. \"If I Were a Boy\" is a pop introspective ballad which draws influences from folk rock through its instrumentation of which includes acoustic guitars, drums and strings. The song's lyrics lament the misunderstandings between the genders and indict the male side of relationships. \"If I Were a Boy\" was well received by critics, who complimented Beyonc\u00E9's tormented and emotive vocal performance and called the song her best work to date. The single was a commercial success as it placed in the top ten on twenty-five different singles charts. It topped the charts in more than eight European countries, including the United Kingdom, where it is Beyonc\u00E9's best-selling single. \"If I Were a Boy\" peaked at number three on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart and earned multi-platinum certifications in Australia, Canada, and the US. The accompanying music video for \"If I Were a Boy\" was directed by Jake Nava and shot in black-and-white. With a theme of role reversal, it is conceptually similar to the American comedy film Freaky Friday (1976). A video for the Spanish version of the ballad was edited from the original clip. Beyonc\u00E9 promoted \"If I Were a Boy\" through live performances at venues including The Oprah Winfrey Show, the 52nd Grammy Awards, and the I Am... World Tour (2009\u201310). The song has been covered several times on televised music competitions. American singer Reba McEntire sang a country version of the ballad on Country Music Television (CMT), and a studio version was released as the second single from her 2010 album, All the Women I Am."@en ;

The song hit No. 1 on the U.S. R&B and Dance charts and reached the Top 10 on the Billboard Hot 100. It received a Grammy Award nomination for Best R&B Song at the 31st Grammy Awards in 1989. It lost out to Anita Baker's \"Giving You the Best That I Got\". The song started as an instrumental track for which Keith Sweat brought in Kemp to write lyrics. Sweat ultimately passed on the song that was originally written for his 1987 debut Make It Last Forever. Kemp recorded a demo of the new song, intending for it to be used by another singer; his \"scratch vocal\" ended up on the final release. The song was later covered by 'N Sync on their album No Strings Attached (which was coincidentally co-produced by the song's original co-writer Teddy Riley), and was sampled by Kurupt on the song entitled \"At It Again\" off his Space Boogie: Smoke Oddessey album. Kemp performs \"Just Got Paid\" in an \"all-star finale\" on Keith Sweat's 2007 DVD Sweat Hotel Live, recorded at a February 2006 concert in Atlanta, Georgia."@en ;

The Alan Moulder Mix featured as the opening track for the European version of Gran Turismo 3: A-Spec. It was first released on the \"Seven Days in the Sun\" single as a B-side. It was released as a single as it was included on the Gran Turismo soundtrack; it is a common misconception that \"pressure from fans\" was the reason.[citation needed] Despite having already appeared in the top 20 earlier in the year as a B-side, the single A-side release stayed in the top 20 for 4 weeks, peaking at number 12. It instantly became a regular to end the band's live sets, but has been occasionally rested from this position for a cover of \"Breed\" by Nirvana, while never used as one of the \"Feeder covers\" at Renegades gigs. \"Just a Day\" has sold over 100,000 downloads and physical copies combined. Feeder's performance of \"Just a Day\" on CD:UK in December 2001 was Feeder's last with Jon Lee. The week Jon Lee died, the band were due to appear on Top of the Pops performing \"Can't Stand Losing You\", a cover of The Police which appears on CD1 of this EP. Their place was taken by Ash performing \"There's a Star\". Before the release of the single, Feeder had already appeared on Later... with Jools Holland for the first time.

	dbo:abstract	"\"Liar\" is a song by the British rock band Queen, written by the lead singer Freddie Mercury in 1970, and originally titled \"Lover\". The song featured on the band's 1973 debut album Queen. A heavily truncated version of \"Liar\" was released as a single \u2014backed with \"Doing All Right\" \u2014 in the United States by Elektra Records in February 1974. In the band's early years, \"Liar\" was a concert staple, performed as a conclusion to their main set and often lasting for up to ten minutes. However, over time the song eventually fell off the setlist, with the exception of The Works Tour (though the song was cut down to three minutes or less). \"Liar\" was referenced in the setlist of the Magic Tour, as Brian May played a partial guitar riff from the song immediately before \"Tear it Up\". During live performances, it was a notable case where John Deacon mimed singing backing vocals - namely, he stood behind Mercury and sang into his microphone, for the \"all day long\" section of the song. This is replicated in the song's promotional video, shot in 1973. Seemingly, Deacon only mouthed the words in live performances, as his voice cannot be heard here on any recording, official or bootlegged. The choice to only mime singing along was presumably a result of Deacon's admitted weaker singing ability. The song also contains a bass solo performed by Deacon, the most substantial solo he ever performed live. As confirmed by the transcription on EMI Music Publishing's Off The Record sheet music for the song, this is one of three Queen tracks, the others being \"Now I'm Here\" and \"Under Pressure\" (their collaboration originally with David Bowie), to feature a Hammond organ. This song briefly brought up the issue of songwriting credits within the band. Brian May queried which band members would be credited for developing the music for each song, to which Freddie Mercury concluded the discussion, stating that the lyricist, or otherwise the individual who originates the song, should be credited as its writer, a practice that continued until \"The Miracle\"."@en ;

Otherwise, the show will be relegated to a much smaller performance area than the main stage. Jimmy is resistant to compromising his work, but after some discussion with others, including Karen Cartwright (Katharine McPhee), who makes some suggestions, Jimmy and Kyle come up with this song, which is then performed as the new opening by Jimmy and Karen (with Derek imagining them performing in front of huge video screens and a lot of spotlights) in front of Scott and his team at the workshop.

	dbo:abstract	"\"The Climb\" is a song performed by American singer Miley Cyrus, for the 2009 film Hannah Montana: The Movie. The song was written by Jessi Alexander and Jon Mabe, and produced by John Shanks. It was released on March 12, 2009, as the lead single of the film's soundtrack by Walt Disney Records. The song is a power ballad with lyrics that describe life as a difficult but rewarding journey. It is styled as a country pop ballad, and was Cyrus' first solo song to be released to country radio. The instrumentation includes piano, guitar and violins. \"The Climb\" was generally well received by critics and was nominated for the Best Song Written for a Motion Picture, Television or Other Visual Media at the 52nd Grammy Awards. However, the song was withdrawn from consideration by Walt Disney Records because it had not been written specifically for a movie as the category's eligibility rules required. The song achieved worldwide success and became a top ten hit on charts in Australia, Canada, Norway and the United States. In the United States, the song peaked at number four on the Billboard Hot 100 and became the eighth best selling digital single of 2009. Five months after its release, the single was certified triple platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). Since, it has been recognized as one of the best-selling singles in the United States. The song's accompanying music video was directed by Matthew Rolston, and depicts scenes of Cyrus climbing a mountain or singing, intercut with clips of Hannah Montana: The Movie. Cyrus promoted the song with several live performances. The first, at the Kids Inaugural: \"We Are the Future\" event on January 19, 2009, was the first time the song had ever been publicly heard. Cyrus also performed the song as the closing number of her Wonder World Tour. The song was also performed during the Gypsy Heart Tour. \"The Climb\" has been covered by several artists and was the most popular choice of song among auditioners for the ninth season of the American singing contest, American Idol, with Hollie Cavanagh performing it in the top 6 of the eleventh season. Simon Cowell, creator of the British television talent show The X Factor, chose \"The Climb\" to be the debut single of the winner of the competition's sixth series. Winner Joe McElderry's cover, released on December 14, 2009 by Syco Music, was produced by Quiz & Larossi and topped the Irish Singles Chart and the UK Singles Chart."@en ;

Released as a single, it reached No. 5 on the UK Singles Chart.

Released on May 8, 1983, by Epic Records, \"Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'\" was the fourth single from Jackson's sixth studio album Thriller (1982). The opening track of the album, it was written, composed and co-produced by Jackson, and was produced by Quincy Jones. The song's lyrics pertain to strangers spreading rumors to start an argument for no good reason. Musically, \"Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'\" evokes the disco sound of Jackson's previous studio album, Off the Wall, released in 1979. The song is characterized by a complex rhythm arrangement and a distinctive horn arrangement. \"Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'\" has been covered and sampled by multiple recording artists since its release. Aside from Thriller, the song appears on multiple compilation and greatest hits albums by Jackson. \"Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'\" was generally well received by contemporary music critics. The song was also commercially successful, charting within the top 20 and top 30 in several countries. It became Jackson's fifth consecutive top 10 single in the United States on the Billboard Hot 100, peaking at number five, and later re-entered charts in 2008 after the release of Thriller 25. Following Jackson's death in June 2009, the song re-entered music charts worldwide, mainly due to digital download sales. Unlike previous singles from Thriller, \"Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'\" did not have a music video to accompany it, but was performed by Jackson on world concert tours, as both a member of The Jacksons and as a solo artist. As part of the release of Thriller 25, a remix of \"Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'\", entitled \"Wanna Be Startin' Somethin' 2008 with Akon\", was recorded with Akon, and released as the second single from the album. The song was commercially successful, mainly charting within the top 10 in six countries, as well as the top 20 in several territories worldwide and top 40 in Canada.

Inspired by Gaga's \"Fear of Self Monster\", the song deals with the intimate experience between two people alone in a bedroom. According to Gaga, the record is about a girl who likes to have sex with the lights off because she is embarrassed about her body. She explained that she came across such women while working on the MAC AIDS Fund, and that the song is not about freedom, but rather the assurance that Gaga understood their feelings. The song was initially planned to be released after \"Telephone\", but due to a dispute between Gaga and her record company, \"Alejandro\" was released instead. It was later released as a digital download and radio-only single in Australia, Belgium, and France. \"Dance in the Dark\" contains retro and new wave music influences, and begins with a stuttering introduction. It includes a spoken interlude, where Gaga says the names of famous people whose lives ended tragically. The song has received critical acclaim from music critics. It charted on the UK Singles Chart and Billboard's Bubbling Under Hot 100 Singles chart, while reaching the top-thirty in Australia and the top-ten in Slovak Republic, Hungary and Czech Republic. Gaga performed \"Dance in the Dark\" as the opening song of The Monster Ball Tour. In the first leg of the tour, she appeared behind a scrim-lit screen to perform the song, while in the revamped shows, Gaga performs it on a set reminiscent of a New York City night scene. The song was also performed at the 2010 BRIT Awards, where Gaga dedicated it to her close friend, Alexander McQueen, who had committed suicide a few days earlier. It was nominated for Best Dance Recording at the 53rd Grammy Awards, but lost to Rihanna's \"Only Girl (In the World)\"."@en ;

In Australia, \"Finer Feelings\" became her lowest-charting single at that point, reaching number sixty on its debut in the ARIA top 100 singles chart for the week ending 5 July 1992. Other than a re-release of \"Better the Devil You Know\" in 1998, \"Finer Feelings\" remained Kylie's only single to miss the top 50 in Australia until her 2010 single \"Get Outta My Way\", which peaked at number sixty-nine. \"Finer Feelings\" remains a fan favourite and Minogue has performed excerpts of the song during her KylieFever2002 and Showgirl Homecoming tours although it was not included on her recent hits compilation, Ultimate Kylie. It is worth noting that the B-side \"Closer\" is different from the song of the same title that would appear on her 2010 album Aphrodite.

It was written and produced by Steve Kipner and David Frank, with additional writing from Pamela Sheyne. The song was released on June 22, 1999 by RCA Records as the album's lead single. \"Genie in a Bottle\" is a teen pop and dance-pop song which incorporates elements from R&B. Lyrically, it uses sexual references to talk about the theme of self-respect. Due to the sexual-oriented lyrics, an edited version of the single was aired on radio instead of the original version. \"Genie in a Bottle\" received generally favorable reviews from contemporary music critics, most of whom praised the song's lyrics and Aguilera's vocals on the track. The single achieved commercial success, peaking atop the record charts of 21 countries. In the United States, the song peaked atop the Billboard Hot 100 and was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), having sold more than 1.4 million copies in the country. A music video for \"Genie in a Bottle\" was directed by Diane Martel and shot in Malibu, California. The video was well received by media outlets and gained many plays on music channels including VH1, Black Entertainment Television and Total Request Live. \"Genie in a Bottle\" has been widely recognized as one of Aguilera's signature songs, and was credited with establishing her name in the music industry. Aguilera recorded two remakes of \"Genie in a Bottle\" and included them on her albums: a Spanish version entitled \"Genio Atrapado\" was included on Mi Reflejo (2000), and an electropop-oriented version entitled \"Genie 2.0\" was included on Keeps Gettin' Better: A Decade of Hits (2008)."@en ;

dbr:Never_Be_Lonely	rdf:type	dbo:MusicalWork ;
	dbo:abstract	"\"Never Be Lonely\" is a song by The Feeling. It is the third single from their debut album Twelve Stops and Home, and was released on 28 August 2006. It entered the UK Singles Chart at #24 on 27 August 2006 based on download sales alone. The following week it climbed to #12 as a physical single was now available. The song climbed into the top ten of the UK singles chart in its third week, peaking at #9. The song's electric piano touches are reminiscent of Supertramp, a band The Feeling have stated as one of their major influences. The B-side \"All You Need to Do\" originally appeared on the original \"Fill My Little World\" release. The setting of the video switches from desert to commuter scenes such as the London Underground, changing back and forth with the varying mood of the song. It has sold around 96,700 copies in the UK since its release. It was nominated for Best Track at the 2006 Q Awards, along with Arctic Monkeys' \"I Bet You Look Good on the Dancefloor\", Snow Patrol's \"Chasing Cars\", Gnarls Barkley's \"Crazy\" and Scissor Sisters' \"I Don't Feel Like Dancin'\". \"Crazy\" eventually won. For several weeks in November, Heart 106.2 shortened the song considerably by shaving the stuttering section which occurs in the chorus from the song. The single was also released on uniquely numbered 7\" vinyl."@en ;
