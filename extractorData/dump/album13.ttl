Final Fantasy IX Original Soundtrack PLUS, an album of music from the game's full motion videos and extra tracks, was released by DigiCube in 2000 and re-released in 2004, and a collection of piano arrangements of pieces from the original soundtrack arranged by Shir\u014D Hamaguchi and performed by Louis Leerink was released as Piano Collections Final Fantasy IX in 2001. The game's soundtrack is best known for \"Melodies of Life,\" the theme song of the game, performed by Emiko Shiratori in Japanese and English. The song was released as a single by King Records in 2000. The soundtrack was based around a theme of medieval music, and was heavily inspired by previous Final Fantasy games, incorporating themes and motifs from earlier soundtracks. The music was overall well received; reviewers found the soundtrack to be both well done and enjoyable, though opinions were mixed as to the reliance on music of previous games. Several tracks, especially \"Melodies of Life\" and \"Vamo' Alla Flamenco\", remain popular today, and have been performed numerous times in orchestral concert series, as well as been published in arranged and compilation albums by Square as well as outside groups."@en ;

The Complete On the Corner Sessions compiles material from 1972 through 1975 which, due to lineup changes Davis made throughout the era, features over two dozen musicians.Columbia has released a series of ten box sets containing recordings from the 1950s to the 1970s. These contain material not available on other Columbia albums. Following The Complete In a Silent Way Sessions, The Complete Bitches Brew Sessions, The Complete Jack Johnson Sessions, and The Cellar Door Sessions, this release includes the funk/jazz fusion album On the Corner. His band was made up of musicians trained not only in the basics of jazz, but on the newer sounds of James Brown and Sly Stone. The box set includes more than 6 hours of music. Twelve of these are previously unissued tracks. Another five tracks are previously unissued in full. They cover sixteen sessions from On the Corner, Big Fun, and Get Up with It until Davis's mid-seventies retirement. Miles is joined in these recordings by Chick Corea, Herbie Hancock, John McLaughlin, Jack DeJohnette, Billy Hart, and many others. The 6-CD deluxe edition also contains a 120-page full-color booklet with liner notes and essays by producer Bob Belden, journalist Tom Terrell, and arranger/composer Paul Buckmaster as well as rare photographs and new illustrations."@en ;

At the time of the album's release, she had relocated to Austin, Texas. The biggest single off the album was \"Sunny Came Home\", which was released in 1997. The cover of this album is a painting by Colvin's friend Julie Speed of a three-eyed woman with a lit match which inspired the song. The song peaked on the Billboard Hot 100 at number 7, and topped the Adult Contemporary, Adult Top 40, and Top 40 Adult Recurrents charts the same year. Another notable song off the album was \"Nothin' on Me\", which peaked at number 24 on Billboard's Adult Top 40 chart. The song was also used on Suddenly Susan as its theme song from 1997 to 2000. Colvin appeared on the show in the second season episode Ready ... aim ... Fong!. She performed the song on the show. Grammy success came to Colvin two years after the release of A Few Small Repairs. In the 1997 Grammy Awards, she was nominated for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance award for \"Get Out of This House\" and Best Pop Album for A Few Small Repairs. At the next year's Grammy Awards, Colvin was nominated for Song of the Year and Record of the Year for \"Sunny Came Home\". She won both awards (sharing Song of the Year with Leventhal). As Colvin was about to begin her speech after winning Song of the Year, rapper Ol' Dirty Bastard stormed the stage protesting his loss of an award that same night, saying, \"...I don't know how you all see it, but when it comes to the children, Wu-Tang is for the children...\" leading him to be escorted off stage. Colvin then began her speech, remarking, \"I'm confused now!\" Overall, A Few Small Repairs made it to number 39 on the Billboard Top 200 chart."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Caught Live + 5 is a live album by The Moody Blues, consisting of a 12 December 1969 live show at the Royal Albert Hall and five previously unreleased studio recordings from 1967 to 1969. The band have expressed their dissatisfaction with their performance that night, citing drug use that impaired their abilities, and as such, the release was desired more by Decca Records, who distributed The Moody Blues' Threshold Records label, than by the band themselves. Nevertheless, the concert showcases the band's versatility on different instruments, and their ability to perform complex material from their first four albums in a live setting. \"Gypsy (Of a Strange and Distant Time)\" is the only representative of the contemporary album To Our Children's Children's Children. The \"+5\" studio tracks were re-released on their 1987 album Prelude. The 8-track tape version of this album has the distinction of being one of the few 8-tracks that is arranged exactly like the album, with no song breaks. While Caught Live + 5 managed to reach #26 during its American chart run, it missed the British listings completely, the first time this had occurred for The Moody Blues since their 1965 debut The Magnificent Moodies. The band remained unhappy with the album, and would not sanction its release on CD until 1996. This is the first Moody Blues album since Days of Future Passed not to feature cover artwork by Philip Travers. Decca Records instead used British art design group Hipgnosis."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Further/Deeper is the 24th album by the Australian psychedelic rock band The Church, released in October 2014. It was the first Church album in five years, during which time founding guitarist Marty Willson-Piper moved to Sweden and was replaced by former Powderfinger guitarist Ian Haug. Kilbey said Haug was asked to join the band on the album only after he had tried for six months to contact Willson-Piper. \"Marty wasn't kicked out or asked to leave. He went to Sweden and when I started writing to him to say let's make an album, he didn't even write back. I tried to contact him by every known means and he didn't reply, so we say he is 'unavailable'.\" He said drummer Tim Powles had suggested Haug\u2014a fan of The Church since his teenage years\u2014as a new guitarist. Haug joined the band in Sydney to record and in five days co-wrote more than 20 songs. \"Ian's enthusiasm re-energised us,\" Kilbey said. \"I'm not blaming Marty for this, but a certain cynicism and scepticism was shattered when Ian joined the band. Ian's all over this record; he's the prime mover behind a lot of the songs. He was always there with his guitar strapped on, suggesting 'What about this?', overdub after overdub. It's very inspiring to be part of that.\" He told Rolling Stone: \"We knew he was a great player but we didn't know if we could work with him. As soon as he turned up, then Peter arrived 10 minutes later, the three of us cooked up 'Miami'. We wrote it quickly and without any pain or bloodshed, so I have a real fond spot for this (song). In concert we've been doing it as the last song and it's just been slaying people. It's just what the doctor ordered for The Church. A new epic.\" Kilbey described Further/Deeper as \"a very energetic, up-tempo record that is very complex musically\". He told the Sydney Morning Herald: \"We've really explored all the parameters of what The Church could be while still remaining The Church and kind of pushing the boundaries of where our music could go and what we could do with the lyrics, the vocals and instrumentation.\" In late 2014 The Church played numerous Australian gigs at which they played the full album. A similar tour of the USA followed in Feb 2015, with selected past songs added at various gigs. The band returned to the US in the Summer of 2015 for a co-headline tour with the Psychedelic Furs."@en ;

An electronic dance album influenced by 1980s dance music and 1990s R&B, Amuro enlisted new producers and songwriters to work on the album, including SeventyEight, Sophie, David Guetta and Zedd. Genic is composed of fourteen new original tracks, excluding previous promotional singles \"Tsuki\", \"Brighter Day\" and their respective b-side tracks. The album was released digitally and in CD format; the CD was either accompanied with an additional DVD or Blu-ray of seven videos or stand-alone. Genic received positive reviews from most music critics, commending the production and single-worthy material. However, some criticized Amuro's English-language progression and composition. Genic entered the Oricon Albums Chart at number one, becoming her eighth number one album and claiming the highest first week sales by a female solo artist in 2015, beating Superfly's album White (2015). The song \"Golden Touch\" was served as a promotional single in Japan and North America in June, while \"Anything\" premiered as the first music video sponsored by Google Chrome.

	dbo:abstract	"I Choose Noise is the third studio album by British progressive breakbeat band Hybrid, as well as an EP by the same. The album included recorded symphonic sequences by the Seattle Session Orchestra, and was produced in collaboration with composer Harry Gregson-Williams. The album was released in the UK on 4 September 2006 and in the United States on October 10, 2006. Although a bonus disc featuring Hybrid's live show at God's Global Gathering was intended to be included, it was omitted due to time constraints and may be released separately. Hybrid's track \"Sleepwalking\" was also originally intended for I Choose Noise, but was omitted because it was felt not to fit into the album. The track did not become available until four years after it was originally produced, with the release of the album Hybrid Remixed. Due to popular demand, several tracks from the album were also released on 12\" vinyl. The three releases were: Dogstar / I Choose Noise, Falling Down / Last Man Standing & Dreamstalker / Just for Today. By 15 December 2006, all three were available through the Distinct'ive Records website."@en ;

It is the tenth studio album recorded by the band under the Jefferson Starship name, the first studio album since 1999's Windows of Heaven and the first on a major label by the band since 1989 when Starship's Love Among the Cannibals and Jefferson Airplane's reunion album, Jefferson Airplane were both released. The new album includes cover songs from Irish, American, English, and Latin-American traditions. The title is a reference to Thomas Jefferson's quotation, \"The tree of liberty must be refreshed from time to time with the blood of patriots and tyrants.\" The idea began in 2003 as \"The Cuba Project\", which was to include classic protest and folk songs recorded in Cuba. In 2008 the album was finally recorded but in California. About half of the songs planned for The Cuba Project were used on the final cut, with other songs coming from Jefferson Starship's previous repertoire and another project band member Paul Kantner had planned called \"On the Threshold of Fire.\" The promotional tour for the album began in late June with shows at Larkspur, California followed by tours in the US and Europe before the album's release, and continued through December 2008 with a further tour in the US and a tour in Japan. On February 1, 2009, more tour dates and venues were announced by the band's manager Michael Gaiman, with additional plans to continue the tour through 2010 and bring it to Australia and South America. David Grisman joined the band for the April 2009 tour dates. The band's promotion for the album ended in June 2009 as the band changed their set-list to Jefferson Airplane's Woodstock Festival material and started touring with the \"Heroes of Woodstock\" through the end of October."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Made in the Dark is the third studio album by English indietronica band Hot Chip. The album, comprising 13 songs, was released on 4 February 2008 on the EMI label. It peaked at number four on the UK Album Chart, number 25 on the Australian album charts, and entered at number 109 on the U.S. Billboard 200. Several singles have been released from the album, including \"Shake a Fist\", \"Ready for the Floor\", which reached number six on the UK Singles Chart, and \"One Pure Thought\". A defining feature of the album is the strong presence of romantic ballads. The ballad \"Made in the Dark\" was described as \"sublime\" by one critic, although not all the ballads received universal praise. Alexis Taylor, the main contributor to the lyrics, stated that he was proud of the album lyrically and felt that feelings of love and happiness, partly the result of his recent marriage, had contributed to the album's romantic tone. Critics stated that songs such as \"Ready for the Floor\" and \"Bendable Poseable\" were reminiscent of their previous release, The Warning. The style of the album was not considered as big a leap forward as the changes evident between Coming on Strong (2004) to The Warning (2006). It was said that Hot Chip had honed their music by using quirks of their musical style to make more accomplished music, however, some critics felt that the album lacked focus, containing too many varied elements; it was described as \"loveable but flawed\"."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"McLaren Furnace Room is the first major label album by Canadian band, The Watchmen. Originally released by SUMO Productions in Canada in 1992 (with the help of MCA Records), the release impressed MCA Records Canada who signed the band and released the album in 1993 on a much wider scale. The title of the album refers to the basement of the McLaren Hotel that served as the band's rehearsal studio. The album was certified Gold in Canada by the Canadian Recording Industry Association on March 6, 1996. Known as a tireless touring band, they reportedly played 150 shows a year across Canada from 1987 to 1991. A show in Toronto at the Horseshoe Tavern in 1991 caught the attention of producer Chris Wardman's girlfriend. She promised to put Wardman in touch with the band. Wardman eventually made it out to one of their shows and promised them a production commitment. Jake Gold's The Management Trust signed them to a management deal and his music production outfit SUMO Productions. Using their clout with MCA Records, SUMO was able to release the band's debut McLaren Furnace Room in 1992. The band then signed directly to MCA Records Canada. At that time in the band's history, the principal songwriter was guitarist Joey Serlin. A video for the lead single \"Cracked\" was filmed and released in 1992 while a video for the second single \"Run & Hide\" was released in 1993. Both videos saw modest play on MuchMusic."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"The Out of Control Tour was the fifth concert tour by British girl group Girls Aloud. It supported their fifth studio album Out of Control. Initially, just ten dates in bigger arenas were announced in November 2008. Due to demand, more dates were added. Girls Aloud performed thirty-two dates across the United Kingdom and Ireland. The tour commenced on 24 April 2009 at Manchester Arena, with the final show on 6 June 2009 in Newcastle's Metro Radio Arena. The show was divided into five unique sections with distinct costumes, including the encore. Each member of the group had their own respective platform. During the show, Girls Aloud use pole dancing techniques and themes of BDSM. Most of the songs performed come from Out of Control, but earlier singles and cover versions were also performed. Like 2008's Tangled Up Tour, there is a smaller stage in the centre of the arena that Girls Aloud perform on during the show. Absent Elk, Emma Deigman, Girls Can't Catch and Julian Perretta were opening acts during the tour."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Severed Survival is the debut album by Autopsy released in 1989. This album somewhat continues in the style of Reifert's former band Death. Lyrically the band thrives heavily on horror and gore concepts; nevertheless these are not inspired directly by horror movies, although the title track is based on Stephen King's short story \"Survivor Type.\" The album was very influential for future death metal acts such as Cannibal Corpse, Entombed and Dismember. It was also a pioneer of gore lyrics and one of the first examples of the death/doom genre. (although it is more death metal than death/doom). The album features Steve DiGiorgio on bass. Various re-releases exist with different bonus tracks and bonus CDs. Also a different cover exists for this album, which depicts the point of view of the person receiving the autopsy. The album is notable for its bass sound which was mixed much higher than all the other tracks. The drumming was also poorly recorded, with the kick drum almost inaudible. To coincide with the album's 20th anniversary, Peaceville Records released a special two-disc edition of Severed Survival on February 23, 2009. It includes rare rehearsal and live material for a bonus disc as well as demo versions of two songs \u2014 \"Mauled to Death\" and \"Human Genocide\" \u2014 which did not make the final cut on the original album. Also featured in the package is a booklet with notes by the band themselves, detailing the history of Autopsy's early years, with rare photos and images.

The album re-introduced Andreas Hedlund's use of all Swedish lyrics, something Vintersorg has not had since their 1999 full-length, \u00D6demarkens son. Another shift for the band was the absence of Asgeir Mickelson, Steve DiGiorgio and Lars Nedland who had all participated on the previous two albums, The Focusing Blur and Visions from the Spiral Generator, handling, drums (Mickelson), bass (DiGiorgio), and guest vocals (Focusing Blur) & select Hammond sections (Visions and Focusing Blur) (Nedland). Instead, Johan Lindgren, Vintersorg's live bassist and Mattias Marklund's bandmate in TME, took over bass duties. Although Vintersorg's live drummer, Benny H\u00E4gglund, was originally planned to be drummer on the album, lack of schedule time resulted in the band just using the drums Hedlund programmed instead. With the prior two albums being strongly rooted in the progressive metal sound, Solens r\u00F6tter is a merge between the early folk inspired albums and the later progressive ones."@en ;

Production for the album began in April 2009 and was completed in January 2010. Sweet 7 is the first release since the controversial departure of Keisha Buchanan, who was replaced by 2009 Eurovision Song Contest entry Jade Ewen in September 2009. As a result of the group line-up change, Sweet 7 was re-recorded to feature the vocals of new member Ewen and for the removal of former member Buchanan's vocals. In addition, this is the first album that features none of the original members. The album was produced by and tipped for a United States release with Jay-Z's entertainment company Roc Nation, but this was later disputed by the group which claimed that Roc Nation was only signed to serve as A&R, as well as to produce Sweet 7. The involvement of Roc Nation's in-house producers gave the album a strong electro and dance-pop sound due to work from US producers and writers, mainly Fernando Garibay, Stargate and The Smeezingtons. Despite the high-profile input, Sweet 7 was negatively received by critics, which was awarded a 39 out of 100 according to aggregated reviews at Metacritic. The negative reviews stemmed to the originality of the image due to the loss of Buchanan, as well as a lack of an identifiable sound and soul from the project. Sweet 7 peaked at number 14 in the UK and number 35 in Ireland, becoming the group's second lowest charting album to date in those countries. Three top ten singles were generated from the album, including the lead single \"Get Sexy\", which peaked at number two in the UK, while \"About a Girl\" and \"Wear My Kiss\" peaked at number eight and seven, respectively. Promotion for the album ended after the release of the final single so that the group could begin work on a new album."@en ;

The tracks covered Dexys' entire career, shown by the fact that, although the album was released on Mercury Records, 9 of the album's 19 songs were recorded for EMI Records, Dexys' first label.

It is one of the original releases by Neil Cooper's then cassette-only label ROIR. It was reissued in 1999 on compact disc as The New Too Much Junkie Business. The album is notable for being one of the few places to find studio versions of Thunders' live staples \"In Cold Blood\" and \"Just Another Girl\", but the album is dominated by live recordings of a typically sloppy and chaotic Thunders performance at the Peppermint Lounge in New York City. Thunders also interjects some studio-recorded interjections throughout the album, including one where he claims that the title track, another live staple, was co-written by Chuck Berry and Bo Diddley along with its actual author, longtime Thunders co-conspirator Walter Lure. Another Thunders composition, \"Who Needs Girls?\", is credited wholly to Booker T. & The MG's because of its resemblance to the veteran Memphis soul act's instrumental \"Green Onions\"."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Touchtone Inferno!!! is the second album by the San Diego, California pop rock band Reeve Oliver, released in 2007 by Summertone Records and Apple Danish Records. The majority of the album was recorded while the band was under contract to Capitol Records, before they were dropped during the label's merger with Virgin Records. As a result the band self-released the album through their own label Apple Danish. The album was initially released through iTunes, while a CD version is available at the band's performances and is planned to be available in certain San Diego-area record stores. Several of the album's songs are drawn from earlier releases. \"Yer Motion\" and \"I Want Burns\" are re-recordings of songs from the band's 2004 debut album. \"Madachu\" is a re-recorded song from the 2004 Baldachu EP, while \"Endless Bummer\" originally appeared on The Endless Bummer EP earlier in 2007. The iTunes version of the album includes the bonus track \"Yer Time,\" which is a b-side from the album's recording sessions and includes drummer Brad Davis' brother Matt playing accordion. Singer/guitarist Sean O'Donnell also announced two other b-sides, both of which are re-cordings of songs from previous releases: \"Young and Dumb\" originally appeared on the band's 2004 debut album, while \"I Can See the World From Here\" originally appeared on The Endless Bummer EP in March 2007. The album's cover model is actress Kaylee DeFer, best known for her role on the television sitcom The War at Home."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Grow Up and Blow Away was the first recorded album by indie rock band Metric. The album was recorded in 2001, but delayed for years by their record label. As the years passed, the band's sound changed to the point where they no longer felt the album would be what the fans expected to hear, so Metric recorded a completely new album, Old World Underground, Where Are You Now?, and released that instead. Last Gang Records later purchased the rights to the album and released it on June 26, 2007. Compared with the 2001 version, the songs \"London Halflife\" and \"Soft Rock Star\" (Jimmy vs. Joe mix) from the 2001 EP Static Anonymity were added \"Torture Me\", \"Fanfare\", and \"Parkdale\" were removed. Also the order of some songs was changed and other songs (like the title track and \"Rock Me Now\") were slightly re-worked. The album's title song (with the lyrics \"die today\" changed to \"fly today\") was used in a television commercial in North America for Polaroid Corporation's I-Zone Sticky Film in 2000-01."@en ;

This was the last studio album released by the band after which Junaid Jamshed, vocalist of the band, went on to pursue a career as a solo singer, Shehzad Hasan, bassist, concentrated on his work as a music producer and Rohail Hyatt, keyboards, formed a production company. \"Hum Tum\" was the highest selling Vital Signs album of all time. The album included famous songs like \"Janaan Janaan\", acoustic pop song, \"Guzray Zamanay Walay\" the patent trademark sound of the band and \"Dair Ho Gayee\" a ghazal like track taken from \"Nain Sey Nain\". The album saw the progressive evolution in the Vital Signs music away from their first album to a more dark and brooding serious side with tracks like \"Main Chup Raha\", \"Un Ka Khayal\" and \"Namumkin\". Singles from the album included \"Hum Tum\", \"Un Ka Khayal\" and \"Yehi Zameen\". The compilation album titled \"Hum Hain Pakistani - Mega Remix\" released in 1997 was basically a re-release of \"Hum Tum\" with an addition of two new songs namely, \"Khelon Sey Zindagi\" and \"Hum Hain Pakistani - remixed\"."@en ;

In Sides saw the band continue the process, begun on their previous album Snivilisation, of moving away from making music for the rave scene towards more intricately crafted melodies and reflective, downtempo tracks. Gathering widespread acclaim not just from dance music magazines but also the UK's more traditional rock music papers such as NME and Melody Maker, the album is considered by many reviewers and fans to be among Orbital's best work.

With only three members remaining \u2013 Nick Rhodes, Simon Le Bon and Warren Cuccurullo \u2013 Duran Duran wrote and recorded several new tracks for the album, and re-recorded songs previously done with Taylor. His work remains on only four songs. Cuccurullo later stated that most of the finished album was reworked TV Mania material originally written by himself and Rhodes. The dismal performance of the album led in part to the dissolution of the band's contract with EMI after almost two decades. EMI gave the band ownership rights and the master tapes to the Medazzaland album, as well as several unreleased audio and videotapes of their 1995 and 1997 concerts. It was rumoured that the band would independently release the album in the UK, but they went on to sign with Hollywood Records and released Pop Trash instead.

Following the departure of former bassist/vocalist Martin VanDrunen, guitarist Patrick Mameli taking over vocal duties. Mameli steered the band towards a more melodic and technical approach. The resulting concept album, Testimony of the Ancients contrasted brutal death metal riffs with melodic interludes and tackled what John Serba describes as, \"strangely philosophical, and oddly compelling, subject matter\". After each song on the album, there was an instrumental outro track. This attempt to push the boundaries of death metal at a time when the scene was saturated with copycat \"one track minded\" bands, mirrored the efforts of fellow progressive bands Atheist and Death who released Unquestionable Presence and Human respectively in 1991, the same year as Testimony. The album can also be seen as a stepping stone on the way to the following Pestilence album Spheres, which departed still further from traditional death metal and headed towards jazz fusion.

	dbo:abstract	"Herb Alpert's Ninth is a 1967 album by Herb Alpert and the Tijuana Brass. It reached number 4 on the Billboard charts and spent 18 weeks on the Top 40. It was the last album by the Tijuana Brass to be released in both mono and stereo versions; all albums afterward would be released in stereo only. It was, as its title indicated, the ninth album released by the Brass. Its cover, in addition to a number of still photos from Brass concerts, included a pop-culture joke. Ludwig van Beethoven had been a popular topic on T-shirts in the late 1960s. In this case, an illustration of Beethoven was shown apparently wearing a T-shirt with Alpert's face on it. The title was also a play on Beethoven's Ninth Symphony. None of Beethoven's Ninth actually appeared in the album tracks, but another classical work did - a medley of the tunes from the opera Carmen, centering on \"Habanera\", and also including \"cameos\" from some of the group's earlier hits - \"Spanish Flea\", \"A Taste of Honey\", \"Whipped Cream\", \"What Now My Love\", \"Zorba The Greek\" and \"Tijuana Taxi\" - worked into the track. The album otherwise featured the usual collection of lively pop hit covers, along with a song called \"A Banda\" that was in the style of some of their earlier hits. The Brass' leisurely rendition of \"The Trolley Song\" was in deliberate contrast to the well-known energetic version originally sung by Judy Garland in the film Meet Me in St. Louis. Other old songs include the Cole Porter standard \"My Heart Belongs to Daddy\" made famous by Mary Martin; and \"The Love Nest\", best known as the radio and TV theme of the George Burns and Gracie Allen programs. Juxtaposed with those oldies was a rendition of the Beatles' \"With a Little Help From My Friends\", its instrumentation emphasizing the monotonal aspects of Ringo Starr's song hit. The album also featured an unusual original entry, a mournful, minor-key melody called \"Bud\", which was written \"In memory of our dear friend Ervan (Bud) Coleman\" (who had died from surgery complications on May 26, 1967 (age 45), before the album was completed) and was also credited as being authored by Coleman and his wife Eleanor. Coleman was the composer of several Brass tunes (notably \"Tijuana Taxi\") and also played guitar, mandolin and banjo on several TJB tracks. He was also a key member of Julius Wechter's Baja Marimba Band (their tribute to him, \"For Bud\", was featured on their 1968 album, Do You Know the Way To San Jose). In addition to the usual brass, the tune featured Spanish guitar. Collaborating with Alpert in the production was his usual cadre of musicians: Nick Ceroli, Bob Edmondson, Tonni Kalash, Lou Pagani, John Pisano and Pat Senatore."@en ;

It was produced, engineered and mixed by Ken Nelson and was recorded at Parr Street Studios, Liverpool, in early 2005. The album was predominantly written by vocalist and rhythm guitarist Juanita Stein. The majority of the album's themes revolve around her own relationships and feelings of affection. Most of the songs were demoed in Australia, but all were recorded in England, as the band relocated there to work with Ken Nelson. Five singles were released from the album, four of which appeared on the UK Singles Chart. The album peaked in the Top 100 in the UK and just outside the Top 50 in Australia. It was, at the time, the fastest selling album on the Bella Union label, and it appeared on album of the year lists in eight different publications. In 2006, Howling Bells was a finalist for the Australian Music Prize Award and a nominee for the Shortlist Music Prize. The 12-track set features a wide array of music styles, including rock, pop, country, folk and blues. Howling Bells performed at numerous club shows and festivals around the world to promote the album. They supported various artists, including Editors, Mercury Rev, Placebo, Snow Patrol and The Killers. In general, Howling Bells was received extremely well by music critics. Those who reviewed it less favourably argued that the album's content was superficial and that the songs were repetitive at times."@en ;

Murder features another recurring topic of Cash's career, and perhaps his favorite subject, but one that he encouraged people \"not to go out and do\". Each album was also released separately on the same day. In 2004 Life, a fourth compilation was released. Although the albums within the box set are compilations, they demonstrate Cash's lifelong affection for releasing concept albums. Examples of previous Cash theme albums include Bitter Tears: Ballads of the American Indian (1964), Sings the Ballads of the True West (1965), America: A 200-Year Salute in Story and Song (1972) and The Rambler (1977). Each of the three discs contains liner notes by a celebrity.

The album was released on September 19, 2006 in the United States, while overseas versions were released in mid-October 2006."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Silent Weapons for Quiet Wars is the debut from Wu-Tang affiliate Killarmy, in an obvious reference to Behold a pale horse, a book written by Milton William Cooper. The group consists of six MCs: Killa Sin, Beretta 9, Islord, 9th Prince, P.R. Terrorist (now Dom Pachino), and ShoGun Assasson; and one producer, 4th Disciple, who produced the majority of the album. Like Black Lung's album of the same name, the title was taken from a document that came to light in the mid-1980s detailing a New-World Order plan for world domination; a topic that was explored in Milton William Cooper's infamous book Behold a Pale Horse. Silent Weapons initially received mixed reviews from critics, who saw the group as a low-rent version of the Wu-Tang Clan because of similarities in the group's street-oriented Five-Percenter rhymes and dark production. The album was well received by Wu-Tang and underground hip hop fans\u2014acclaimed for its unique combat themes and stellar production work. The album's entirely produced by 4th Disciple, except for 2 tracks produced by Wu-Tang Clan leader RZA. Guest appearances include Clan member Masta Killa as well as Clan affiliates Streetlife, Hell Razah and Prodigal Sunn (both of whom are members of Sunz of Man). The album features the singles \"Swinging Swords,\" \"Camouflage Ninjas\" b/w \"Wake Up,\" and \"Wu-Renegades\" b/w \"Clash of the Titans.\""@en ;

The Boys Won't Leave the Girls Alone is also the title of a 1962 album by The Clancy Brothers and Tommy Makem. Two of the Clancy Brothers, Liam and Bobby Clancy, make guest appearances on The Girls Won't Leave the Boys Alone. They both perform \"Freeborn Man of the Traveling People\" with Bobby's son, Finbarr, and daughter, Aoife Clancy, a former member of Cherish the Ladies. This was the final recording of any of the Clancy Brothers together. Liam Clancy also sings \"The Jolly Beggarman\" with Arlo Guthrie on the album. The Clancys' former singing partner, Tommy Makem, appears with John McCutcheon and Tom Chapin on the song, \"Rambling Irishman.\" Other guest artists include Paddy Reilly, Luka Bloom, Pete Seeger, fiddler Brendan Mulvihill, banjo player Eric Weissberg, flutist Matt Molloy, and Liam \u00D3 Maonla\u00ED. In the second half of the recording, the Ladies pay tribute to their families by playing a rendition of \"The Queen of Connemara\" accompanied by their fathers and brothers.

It contains three duets with Johnny Hallyday, Jean-Pierre Ferland and the late Henri Salvador. The first single from the album, \"Parler \u00E0 mon p\u00E8re\" was released on July 2, 2012 and \"Le miracle\" was selected as the second track to promote Sans attendre. Both songs reached number one in Quebec and \"Parler \u00E0 mon p\u00E8re\" also peaked inside the top ten in France. Third single, \"Qui peut vivre sans amour?\" was sent to radio stations in March 2013. Sans attendre received mixed-to-positive reviews from music critics, some of whom noticed that it is a tastefully restrained, personal album. The various themes in the songs include longing for a departed father, the cruelty of love, the healing power of tears, the waning days of an ageing mother or the misery of a baby's death. On the commercial level, the album became a smash success in all French-speaking territories. It debuted at number one in Canada and France with an impressive first week sales of almost 100,000 units in each country.

Like their previous album Decomposer, A Band in Hope features multiple producers, though fewer this time around. According to frontman Shawn Harris' blog, the album was created in a period of despair due to the record sales of Decomposer. Instead of following up with the sister album titled The Mad Silentist, the band scrapped many of the old songs (only 4 remain in the final cut) and re-wrote the album. The new album, as Harris states, sways between hope and despair, and the hope one gets when they feel disillusioned and abandoned."@en ;

Since the dissolution of the band soon after the release of its acclaimed self-titled album in 1997 Maddock and Wilton have found popular and critical success[citation needed] with Goldenhorse. Much of the material on the album was devised while McWilliams was living in a third-floor studio space on Gore Street in Auckland's red-light district. This particular audio environment - with its incessant street brawls, strip club pop and Doobie Brothers hits played by the covers band in the 24-hour bar downstairs - provided a peculiar backdrop for the evolution of delicate instrumentals on tracks such as \"Airshow\" and \"You're Watching Me\". It was here too that McWilliams recorded the one-take improvised vocal for \"My Son the Harpist\", an intentionally free-form lyric which reveals itself to be the story of a complex father/son relationship in a fictitious Pacific village."@en ;

Announced by frontman Robert Schneider in May 2007, Schneider described Electronic Projects for Musicians as having \"all of our non-LP material since [Fun Trick Noisemaker] came out\" \u2014 a time period that spans 12 years. Electronic Projects for Musicians does include most of the band's non-LP material released while the band was signed to spinART Records, excluding songs found on the Look Away + 4 and Let's Go! EPs, due to licensing issues. The song \"Dreams\", an unfinished recording intended for release on the band's 1997 LP Tone Soul Evolution, is included on Electronic Projects for Musicians with newly recorded instrumentals. In late 2007, fans were invited to remix the song \"Can You Feel It?\" from the most recent Apples LP, New Magnetic Wonder. Over 20 master tracks from the song's production were made available for download. The grand prize winning song (dubbed the \"Mild Davis remix\") is currently available for download with purchase of Electronic Projects for Musicians.

This concert was one of the first ever music concerts issued on videotape and laser disc in 1981 under the title California Jam in Japan and the UK. This is the first official release on DVD of the complete concert. \"Lay Down, Stay Down\" was not included on the original video release. The camera angles are also different from the original 1981 release, from which two songs are provided as bonus items. The first four songs are from the newly released album Burn. Other songs are from the Made in Japan setlist. \"Smoke on the Water\", \"Space Truckin'\" and also \"Lazy\" and \"The Mule\", which are played as intro and outro during \"You Fool No One\". Deep Purple continued to perform concerts worldwide, including an appearance at the 1974 'California Jam', a televised concert festival that also included many other prominent bands. At the moment Deep Purple were due to appear, Ritchie Blackmore locked himself in his dressing room and refused to go onstage. Previous performers had finished early, and it was still not sunset, the time at which the band had originally been scheduled to start. Blackmore felt this would dull the effect of the band's light show. After ABC brought in a sheriff to arrest him, Blackmore agreed to perform. At the culmination of the performance, he destroyed several of his guitars and threw one of his amplifier stacks off the edge of the stage. He also struck one of the ABC cameras with a guitar and, in recorded footage, can be seen arranging for his road crew to set off a pyrotechnic device in one of his amplifiers, creating a large fireball that was quickly extinguished. The band quickly exited the venue by helicopter, avoiding fire marshals, police officers and ABC executives."@en ;

Layzie's nickname L-Burna, which was given to him by his brother a couple of years ago, comes from his desire to put the heat on his competition. Layzie Bone told LAUNCH about his choice of album title. \"I just feel like I'm a thug by nature,\" the Cleveland rapper said. \"It's just in my nature to be that way. I'm not trying to be a thug. I was born this way. It's what I'm made up to be.\" Time Will Tell features Dekumpozed of NX who was first featuring on DJ U-Neek's Ghetto Street Pharmacist, where Layzie does the track Murda Murda with Lethal who is also from NX.

	dbo:abstract	"Only Built 4 Cuban Linx... is the solo debut album of American rapper and Wu-Tang Clan member Raekwon, released on August 1, 1995, by Loud Records and RCA Records. The album was loosely composed to play like a film with Raekwon as the \"star,\" fellow Wu-Tang member Ghostface Killah as the \"guest-star,\" and producer RZA as the \"director.\" It features appearances from every member of the Wu-Tang Clan and affiliates Cappadonna, and Blue Raspberry. It also features an acclaimed guest appearance from rapper Nas, which marked the first collaboration with a non-affiliated artist on a Wu-Tang related album. Upon its release, Only Built 4 Cuban Linx... debuted at number four on the Billboard 200 chart, and number two on the Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart, while selling 130,000 copies in its opening week. The album was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) on October 2, 1995, and according to Nielsen Soundscan, it has sold 1.1 million copies in the United States alone. Although it failed to acquire the same initial sales success as previous Wu-Tang solo albums, Cuban Linx achieved greater critical praise, with many complimenting its cinematic lyricism and production. Only Built 4 Cuban Linx... has received acclaim from music critics and writers over the years, with many lauding it as one of the greatest hip hop albums of all time. With its emphasis on American Mafia insinuations and organized crime, the album is widely regarded as a pioneer of the mafioso rap subgenre. It has been esteemed as being highly effective on hip hop music over the next decade, being heavily referenced and influential on acclaimed albums such as Reasonable Doubt (1996) and Life After Death (1997). Along with GZA's Liquid Swords, Cuban Linx... is widely classified as the best solo Wu-Tang material. In 2012, Rolling Stone magazine placed it at number 480 on their 500 Greatest Albums of All Time list."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Doll Domination is the second and final studio album by American pop girl group The Pussycat Dolls. It was released on September 19, 2008 by Interscope Records. Initially titled To Those Who Wait, the group later stated in an interview that the album had been renamed Doll Domination after many requests from fans. Doll Domination was the first album released following the departure of group member Carmit Bachar, and was the last album released with the remaining group members from the original lineup\u2014Ashley Roberts, Jessica Sutta, Melody Thornton, Kimberly Wyatt and Nicole Scherzinger. Throughout 2009 the album was reissued in several different forms. Doll Domination generally received mixed to negative reviews, with most critics citing poor efforts to offer better material than their debut album. The record debuted at number four on the U.S. Billboard 200 with first-week sales of 79,000 copies. In doing so, it became the group's highest charting album, but with a lower first-week sales tally. It experienced similar peaks on charts worldwide, reaching the top five on the albums chart in Australia, Canada, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. Six singles were released in support of Doll Domination. The album was preceded by the release of the lead single, \"When I Grow Up\" which reached the top ten in 16 countries. The third single, \"I Hate This Part\", reached number eleven on the Billboard Hot 100 and also charted within the top ten in most countries. \"Jai Ho! (You Are My Destiny)\" caused controversy as the single was credited as \"Pussycat Dolls featuring Nicole Scherzinger\", which caused tension within the group and rumored that Scherzinger would be going solo. It peaked atop the charts in 17 countries and reached a milestone in United States for the largest single-week leap from number 100."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Everyone Is Everybody Else is a 1974 album by British Rock Band Barclay James Harvest. It was released in the UK on 14 June 1974 and was their first album for the Polydor label after they had parted company with EMI. The album was produced by Rodger Bain, who had previously worked with Black Sabbath in producing their first three albums. He also produced heavy rock bands Judas Priest and Budgie. There was said to be strained relations between Bain and the band, due to the preference of his musical style, with the band unhappy with the results of the song \"Child of the Universe\" in particular; Woolly Wolstenholme's only contribution was also left off the original album. While the band were said not to be entirely happy with the results, the album was regarded by many as their artistic high point. It was played extensively on Radio Caroline, particularly the tracks \"For No One\" (whose lyrics contain the title of the album) and \"Child of the Universe\". Radio Caroline subsequently broadcast a documentary on the band, secretly mixed at the studios of Capital Radio in London. The Album was subsequently voted by Radio Caroline listeners at no 13 on the Top 100 All Time Album Chart. It also led to a BBC Radio 1 session with John Peel. Although the album did not chart, it was nevertheless an important album that directly contributed to subsequent limited UK success and considerable European success for the band, particularly in Germany, France and Switzerland."@en ;

Like some of her previous efforts (Okaerinasai and Oiro Naoshi), it comprises the materials that she wrote for other singers. The album features three top-ten hit singles. Among them, \"Haru Nanoni\" was recorded by pop idol Yoshie Kashiwabara in 1983. It became Kashiwabara's most successful single after her breakthrough \"Hello Goodbye\", peaking at #6 on the Japanese Oricon chart. Nakajima's contribution won the 25th Japan Record Awards for the \"Best Songwriting Prize\". \"Lonely Canary\" is one of Kashiwabara's subsequent materials written by Nakajima, released in 1985 and charted at #9. The lead-off track, \"K\u014Dsa ni Fukarete,\" was recorded by Shizuka Kud\u014D and released as a single 2 months before Kaikinetsu came out. Nakajima had previously contributed the lyrics for her records, including two chart toppers \"Fu-Ji-Tsu\" and \"Mu-Go,n...Iroppoi\". \"K\u014Dsa ni Fukarete\" also reached the summit of the Oricon shortly after its release, becoming the fifth of Kudo's eight consecutive #1 hit singles. In Japan, it became one of the biggest hits of 1989 with sales of over 580,000 copies, winning the 4th RIAJ Gold Disc Awards for \"The Best Five Singles of Year\" category. Following the smash hit single interpreted by Kudo, Kaikinetsu sold better than other Nakajima's albums released in the late 1980s.

It is a concept album that tells the story of a pale-skinned girl named Angel, from her troubled youth to her sudden rise to fame as a movie star to her tragic decline and untimely death. Reportedly, it was inspired by the life of Marilyn Monroe, and indeed the final track name-checks Marilyn and Arthur Miller. As a rock opera, it follows the example of The Pretty Things' S. F. Sorrow rather than The Who's Tommy, with the liner notes telling the complete story and the songs expounding on key events. Many of the songs are tied together by brief musical segues. The band worked on the album privately from 1970 to 1971. They had a deal in place to deliver the finished album to a record label for distribution, but the deal suddenly dissolved. The album went unreleased until 1991, when it was released by the band's own The Kaleidoscope Record Company (KRC 001 CD). Many subsequent CD releases package the album with the previous Fairfield Parlour album From Home to Home."@en ;

dbr:Lost_Wisdom	rdf:type	schema:MusicAlbum ;
	dbo:abstract	"Lost Wisdom is an album by Mount Eerie, with Canadian musicians Julie Doiron and Frederick Squire. It was released 7 October 2008 on P. W. Elverum & Sun. The recording of the album was somewhat spontaneous. Doiron and Squire had a few days between a recent tour and an upcoming recording session in Olympia, Washington, and made a surprise visit to Phil Elverum in Anacortes. Although Elverum was reluctant to ask the two to record an album, the three decided to do so and quickly recorded the album. Elverum considers Doiron his favorite singer, and says recording with her was a \"dream come true\" for him. She was a member of Eric's Trip, an indie noise pop band from the early 1990s, and has since recorded numerous solo albums. Elverum considers Eric's Trip his favorite band of all time, and says the band is \"the reason why I got into playing music\". On The Microphones' 2000 album It Was Hot, We Stayed in the Water, he covered the Eric's Trip song \"Sand\" from their 1993 EP Songs About Chris. The Microphones song \"I Felt You\", from the 1999 album Don't Wake Me Up, samples the Eric's Trip song \"May 11\" from the 1993 album Love Tara. A different version of the song \"With My Hands Out\" appears on Mount Eerie's 2004 release Seven New Songs, and other tracks later appeared on Dawn, released on 1 November 2008. The track \"Voice in Headphones\" on this album reprises the chorus from Bj\u00F6rk's song \"Undo\", over a different verse. Elverum had previously covered Bj\u00F6rk's \"All Is Full of Love\" on the 2001 Microphones album Blood. The album was included in Pitchfork Media's \"Best New Music\" on 14 October 2008."@en ;

Nina Hagen in Ekstase, a German version of the album, was released the same year. It is her last album to be released on the Columbia Records label, before her recording contract expired in 1986. The album is mainly produced by Adam Kidron and was recorded in Ibiza and Paris. Hagen worked with Karl Rucker and Billy Liesegang and wrote most of the songs on the album. Unlike her previous disco-influenced album Fearless (1983), Nina Hagen in Ekstasy is musically more punk rock with elements of dance music. It contains cover versions of Frank Sinatra's \"My Way\" and Norman Greenbaum's \"Spirit in the Sky\". After its release, Nina Hagen in Ekstasy received mixed reviews from the critics and although it was released during the rise of Hagen's popularity in the United States, the album was not a big commercial success. She appeared as a guest on many television shows, including Late Night with David Letterman and The Merv Griffin Show, where she promoted the record. In January 1985, she performed at one of the largest music festivals in the world, Rock in Rio, where she performed most of the songs from the album. The lead single \"Universal Radio\" became a club hit, peaking at number 39 on the Billboard Hot Dance Club Songs."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"The 1972 Atlantic release Roberta Flack & Donny Hathaway is a million-selling duet album by Roberta Flack and Donny Hathaway produced by Joel Dorn and Arif Mardin. Flack and Hathaway were both solo artists on the Atlantic roster who'd enjoyed critical acclaim, but Flack had enjoyed limited commercial success. Both were graduates of Howard University, although Flack's attendance there pre-dated Hathaway's, the two singers' careers had overlapped: Flack had included Hathaway compositions on her First Take and Chapter Two albums with the latter also featuring Hathaway as pianist, arranger and background vocalist. It was Jerry Wexler who suggested a joint venture might consolidate Flack and Hathaway's popularity. The first single from Roberta Flack & Donny Hathaway was a version of \"You've Got a Friend\" recorded before the single release of the James Taylor version: both tracks debuted on the Hot 100 dated 29 May 1971 \u2014 marking Flack's first chart appearance \u2014 and, although Taylor's version reached #1, the Flack/Hathaway duet ascended as high as #29 and was a top ten R&B hit at #8. (The B-side, \"Gone Away,\" was a Chapter Two track written by Hathaway.) The second single from the duets album was a remake of \"You've Lost That Lovin' Feelin'\" that became a #30 R&B hit, peaking on the Hot 100 at #71. It was the album's third single \"Where Is the Love\" \u2014 released in April 1972, almost a year after the album itself \u2014 that would be the smash hit, largely due to Flack having had her solo career breakthrough with \"The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face\". Although Hathaway had enjoyed more solo success than had Flack prior to their teaming up, his subsequent solo career was desultory, with no high-profile success prior to his re-teaming with Flack for \"The Closer I Get to You\" in 1978. Hathaway had recorded two songs for a second duet album with Flack \u2014 that became the Roberta Flack Featuring Donny Hathaway album \u2014 at the time of his death on 13 January 1979."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"The Cook The Thief His Wife & Her Lover is the twelfth album release by Michael Nyman and the ninth to feature the Michael Nyman Band. It is the soundtrack to the eponymous film by Peter Greenaway. The album includes the first commercially released recording of Memorial (Greenaway heard a radio recording of the original performance that has not been commercially released), and this is the only piece discussed in the liner notes, to the point that the lyric sheet for \"Miserere\" (based on Psalm 51), the song which Pup the kitchen boy sings, is misidentified \"Memorial.\" \"Book Depository\" is one of Nyman's many waltzes. Nyman does not here identify the origin of Memorial as a bass ground from Henry Purcell's King Arthur, but he does so elsewhere, including on After Extra Time. The liner notes primarily note the 1985 Heysel Stadium disaster that occurred during the work's composition and became what the work was about and a discussion of the premiere of the work in a disused nuclear power plant in Yainville before Paul Richards's painting, The Kiss, and its ultimate \"dismantling,\" preventing it from being used to commemorate the 1989 Hillsborough disaster. There is some music in the film that is not included on the soundtrack album: the love theme for Michael and Georgina, which is \"Fish Beach\" from Drowning by Numbers, the song (\"Something Sometime Soon\") performed as a show in the restaurant, or a doubly pulsed variation of Memorial that occurs about halfway through the film. Edits of \"Memorial\" appear throughout the film, with the entire twelve-minute movement accompanying the final scene and end credits, but one variation is uniquely created for the film."@en ;

The album features 23 tracks and a bonus remix. The songs have all been digitally remastered and also remixed from the original master tapes. The quality of the sound is much clearer than any collection before, however, the mixes can sound drastically different from the original versions, especially the songs recorded between 1964 and 1969. Having used the original elements from the original masters, the mixers were able to attain new recordings, with much clearer sounds, heavier bass and noticeably higher volume levels of the background vocals. Another peculiarity about several songs on this album is that they are longer than the original versions. The vocals and instrumentations are let go on until the musicians stopped playing and the girls finished singing, without fade-outs. These had never been heard before being issued on this album. It remains a steady seller having been in the iTunes Top 50 R&B Albums since release. It has charted on the catalog chart for a decade. Soundscan posts over 500,000 sold since release. The UK version of the album uses different masters of lesser quality, and the remixing and mastering that is exclusive to this album are missing. Also, \"I Hear a Symphony\" and \"The Boss\" have been removed and substituted by \"I'm Still Waiting\" and \"Chain Reaction,\" which were both solo #1 hits for Diana Ross in the UK."@en ;

The sound and musical style of Angels Never Die is very similar to what can be heard on the second Doro solo album, alternating heavy rock tracks with large choruses and power ballads, in the vein of the declining pop metal that had dominated the American rock charts for the first part of the decade. The album was not published in the USA and had limited success in Europe. However, the video for the song \"Bad Blood\" was voted best anti-racism video during the first MTV Europe Music Awards ceremony in 1994.

In its review of the album, CDJournal described Arisa as an \"idol record\" that can appeal to actual music lovers. The online magazine praised Mizuki's vocal ability for being \"far greater than the typical teenager\" and noted that the only apparent flaw was the album's lack of cohesion. The album spawned three singles, \"Densetsu no Sh\u014Djo,\" \"Eden no Machi,\" and \"Kaze no Naka de,\" all of which were top ten hits. The original version of \"Densetsu no Sh\u014Djo\" is not featured on the album, instead an extended album version was included. Arisa debuted at number 8 on the Oricon Weekly Albums chart, selling 49,950 copies in its first week.

	dbo:abstract	"Fast And Cheap Mixes is the 2010 remix album project by HK119. The album is a collection of remixes of tracks from her 2008 album Fast, Cheap And Out Of Control, after all the tracks were made available in their individual parts via HK119's official website as part of a competition for anyone to submit their own remixes of the tracks to be considered for a later release. London-based Electronica netlabel Bit-Phalanx commissioned its entire roster of artists to remix one of the tracks each and compiled their own remix album of the Fast, Cheap And Out Of Control tracks. The original intention was for Bit-Phalanx to release the album through their own netlabel, but the album quickly caught the attention of One Little Indian Records, who offered to give the album an official digital release in 2010. The 11 remixes that feature on the album all cover very different areas of the Electronica genre. Including dubstep, acid, IDM, Electro, Drum and bass, abstract, ambient and Electro-acoustic. On 4 December 2009, online music magazine Wears The Trousers gave away a free 6-minute megamix mp3 featuring selections from each remix on the album, as part of the magazine's weekly 'Free Music Friday. On 7 December 2009, Bit-Phalanx released a free bonus 7-track EP of additional remixes of the track \"C'est La Vie\". The original track was issued as Fast, Cheap And Out Of Control's lead single, and was specifically omitted from Fast And Cheap Mixes to make more of a feature out of the EP, which included mixes from other guest artists as well as other remixes from acts featured on the album. In January 2010, Fast And Cheap Mixes received an exclusive first digital release through the Bleep.com digital store. The album went on general release through all usual digital retail stores on April 26, 2010, in conjunction with Bit-Phalanx's final free EP of bonus remixes for the track \"Space Pt.1\"."@en ;

Allmusic critic Mark Deming noted that the album finds songwriter and lead singer Doug Fieger having resolved his issues with women, but has not \"found a subject that appears to compel him nearly as much as the treacheries of girls once did.\" Therefore, Deming feels that compared to older songs by the band, the songs on Normal as the Next Guy \"may be more pleasant, but they're not as interesting.\" The Rolling Stone Album Guide gave the album a 3 star rating, as high as the group's d\u00E9but Get The Knack, and higher than any other Knack studio album. Normal as the Next Guy was The Knack's first release on Smile Records. Pat Torpey and David Henderson play drums on Normal as the Next Guy, instead of original Knack drummer Bruce Gary.

	dbo:abstract	"The Winter of Mixed Drinks is the third studio album by Scottish indie rock band Frightened Rabbit, released on 1 March 2010 through independent label FatCat Records. As with its predecessor, the critically acclaimed The Midnight Organ Fight (2008), the album was recorded and produced by Peter Katis. Vocalist, guitarist and songwriter Scott Hutchison states that The Winter of Mixed Drinks is \"more of a storytelling record\" than the band's previous two albums, and notes that the album is \"about an escape and maybe even a slight breakdown. I have to say, it's semi-fictional. There's a protagonist who is possibly male but it doesn't really describe my life because if I did that it wouldn't make for an interesting album this time around as I\u2019ve been quite solid and content, thankfully.\" The album was preceded by the singles \"Swim Until You Can't See Land\" and \"Nothing Like You\", released during November 2009 and February 2010, respectively. The album's third single \"Living in Colour\" was released on 14 June. The album's title comes from a line in the song \"Living in Colour\", with Hutchison stating, \"I think we've all had odd, lonely, fallow periods in life, where you find yourself detached from everything, drifting and lost. That's what [the title] means to me, but most importantly, it's the moments of joy afterwards, during recovery, that defines the dark period.\" The album's fourth and final single \"The Loneliness and the Scream\" was released in November 2010."@en ;

In fact (excluding the latter two of the absent songs), tracks 6 through 13 on the second disc of this compilation are an exact replication of the track order on A Night to Remember.

	dbo:abstract	". Avril Lavigne is the self-titled fifth studio album by Canadian recording artist Avril Lavigne, released on 1 November 2013 by Sony Music Entertainment. The album is a follow-up to her 2011 effort Goodbye Lullaby and was developed shortly after its release. Lavigne collaborated with numerous producers including Martin Johnson, Peter Svensson, David Hodges, Matt Squire and her then-partner Chad Kroeger. In both musical and lyrical aspects, the album represents a departure from the acoustic-oriented production of her previous album Goodbye Lullaby, featuring a more pop and upbeat sound juxtaposed with power and piano ballads. Avril Lavigne also incorporates electronic music, industrial and punk rock. The album features two vocal collaborations: Kroeger and American industrial metal singer Marilyn Manson. The album received generally favorable reviews from music critics, who praised its carefree, feel-good vibe, while also calling it one of her best albums. However, some criticized the \"rebellious\" attitude in some tracks, calling it forced and unnatural. Avril Lavigne debuted at number five on the Billboard 200, selling 44,000 copies in its first week. While this proved to be her fifth consecutive top-five album on the chart, it also tallied the lowest first-week sales of Lavigne's career. It also peaked at number two in Japan, selling 47,873 copies in its first week, the highest opening for the album in a particular country. Worldwide, the album impacted moderately on the charts, reaching the top-ten in over twelve countries, while peaking at number one in China and Taiwan. Three singles were released from the album worldwide. The first, \"Here's to Never Growing Up\", garnered moderate success, reaching the top-twenty in Australia, Canada, the United Kingdom and the United States.

Produced and composed by Burnley, the album took shape towards the end of the hiatus and was mostly written before the new lineup \"even played a single note together.\" The recording process took place afterwards at both a personal studio of Burnley's and at the same studio Phobia (2006) was recorded, with all of the band members performing their respective instruments, including background vocals performed by guitarist Keith Wallen and bassist Aaron Bruch, making the record their first to feature vocals other than Burnley's. The album was a critical and commercial success. It garnered mostly positive reception, many critics praising the album for staying true to the group's established sound, although others criticized it for sounding too similar to previous material. Burnley described that he did not want to \"reinvent the wheel\" with the album. It debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200, the group's first in their catalog, selling 141,000 units in its first week, making it heretofore the group's most successful sales effort. The album's lead single is \"Failure\", which was announced alongside the album on March 18, 2015."@en ;

The tracks \"Distant Past\" and \"Regret\" were released as singles throughout 2015. The album's lyrical themes are dark, focusing on global tensions and political happenings during 2014. The rise of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, media coverage of the 2015 general election in the United Kingdom and various mass shootings influenced the album's lyrics, while the band's musical sound was composed to provide contradiction to the violent subject matter. As with previous Everything Everything work, the majority of the songs are presented as in-character narration. Get to Heaven was received well by critics, with most reviewers noting the effectiveness of the album's message; others commented on the bold, aggressive nature of the album, with some labelling the tone \"overwhelming\"."@en ;
