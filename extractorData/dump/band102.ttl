	dbo:abstract	"Ancient is a Norwegian black metal band from Bergen, formed in 1992. The band released six full-length albums released by Metal Blade Records to date and a variety of mini-albums, EPs and special releases. Ancient used to have the classic raw black metal sound, similar to Darkthrone's works. Beginning with The Cainian Chronicle, they moved towards a more Nordic/atmospheric black metal sound, akin to Emperor and a cleaner production. After a period of turmoil concerning their line-up, they went on to add gothic-style instruments such as violins, a female vocalist, and synthesizers to their music. To this day Ancient can be considered as one of the original Norwegian black metal bands that were part of the now famous scene of the early nineties. They were one of the very first Norwegian black metal bands to sign for a semi-major label (Metal Blade Records). There is no evidence of any involvement of Ancient with the infamous occurrences of the Norwegian black metal scene, although they were part of the same scene. Ancient can be considered as a historical black metal act by all standards, whose path took a different course upon their relocation around the world and subsequent exit from the local Norwegian scene."@en ;

After the success of their full debut the band recruited Charlotte Hatherley as a guitarist and vocalist, releasing their second record Nu-Clear Sounds in 1998. After narrowly avoiding bankruptcy the band released Free All Angels in 2001 and a string of successful singles. Their fourth record Meltdown, released in 2004, was the band's final record with Hatherley before returning to their original three-piece lineup for their fifth studio album Twilight of the Innocents in 2007. After five conventional albums the band released 26 singles in The A-Z Series in 2009, one every two weeks. The band have had one silver, two gold and two platinum-selling (and chart-topping) records in the United Kingdom, as well as 18 songs in the top 40 of the UK Singles Chart. In 2015, they released a sixth studio album, entitled Kablammo!.

	dbo:abstract	"Bad Religion is an American punk rock band that formed in Los Angeles, California, in 1979. They make extensive use of three-part vocal harmonies (which they refer to in their album liner notes as the \"oozin' aahs\") and guitar solos, and are known for their lyrics, which cover topics such as criticism of religion, political commentary and social responsibility. The band's lineup has changed several times over its lifespan, with lead vocalist Greg Graffin being the only consistent member; the current lineup, however, features three of the band's four original members (Graffin, Brett Gurewitz and Jay Bentley). To date, Bad Religion has released sixteen studio albums, two live albums, three compilation albums, three EPs (one of which is composed of covers of Christmas songs) and two DVDs (which were both recorded live). They are considered to be one of the best-selling punk rock acts of all time, having sold over five million albums worldwide. Bad Religion had built an underground following in the United States with their early albums (including Suffer, No Control, Against the Grain and Generator) before signing to Atlantic Records in 1993. They rose to fame that same year with their seventh studio album Recipe for Hate, which peaked at number 14 on Billboard's Heatseekers chart. Recipe for Hate was followed a year later by Stranger than Fiction, which spawned their biggest hits \"Infected\" and the re-recorded version of \"21st Century (Digital Boy)\", and was certified gold in both the United States and Canada. Shortly before the release of Stranger than Fiction, Gurewitz left Bad Religion to run his label Epitaph on a full-time basis, and was replaced by Brian Baker. Since the return of Gurewitz in 2001, the band has undergone a resurgence in popularity, with their sixteenth studio album True North (2013) becoming Bad Religion's first album to crack the top 20 on the Billboard 200 chart, where it peaked at number 19. The band is expected to release their seventeenth studio album in 2017."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Badfinger were a British rock band that, in their most successful lineup, consisted of Pete Ham, Mike Gibbins, Tom Evans, and Joey Molland. The band evolved from an earlier group called The Iveys that was formed in 1961 by Ham, Ron Griffiths and David \"Dai\" Jenkins in Swansea, Wales. The Iveys were the first group signed by the Beatles' Apple label in 1968. Over the next five years the band recorded five albums for Apple and toured extensively, before they became embroiled in the chaos of Apple Records' dissolution. In 1969, Griffiths left and was replaced by Molland, and the band renamed themselves Badfinger. In 1970, the band engaged American businessman Stan Polley to manage their commercial affairs. Badfinger had four consecutive worldwide hits from 1970 to 1972: \"Come and Get It\" (written and produced by Paul McCartney), \"No Matter What\", \"Day After Day\" (produced by George Harrison) and \"Baby Blue\". In 2013, \"Baby Blue\" made a resurgence onto the Billboard Hot Rock Songs chart at number 14 after it was featured in the series finale of the television show Breaking Bad. Their song \"Without You\" has been covered many times, including a Billboard number one hit for Harry Nilsson. After Apple Records folded, Badfinger signed to Warner Bros. Records, but Polley's financial machinations resulted in internal friction that soon caused Ham to quit Badfinger, to be replaced by Bob Jackson on keyboard and guitar, then led to Ham rejoining and Molland leaving the band instead. However, a lawsuit filed by Warner's music publishing arm against Polley over missing escrow account money led Warner to withdraw Badfinger's 1974 Wish You Were Here from the market seven weeks after its release, which effectively cut off the band's income. Warner's then refused to accept (or pay the band for) Badfinger's next album, Head First, because of the dispute with Polley, leaving the band destitute. Three days before his 28th birthday, on 24 April 1975, Ham committed suicide by hanging himself, leaving a note that included damning comments about Polley. Over the next three years, the surviving members struggled to rebuild their personal and professional lives against a backdrop of lawsuits, which tied up the songwriters' royalty payments for years. The Badfinger albums Airwaves (1979) and Say No More (1981) (both of which excluded both Gibbins and Jackson) foundered, as Molland and Evans see-sawed between cooperation and conflict in their attempts to revive and capitalise on the Badfinger legacy. Having seen Ham's body after Ham's wife had called him, Evans reportedly never got over his friend's suicide, and was quoted as saying in darker moments, \"I wanna be where he is.\" On 19 November 1983, Evans also took his own life by hanging."@en ;

Best remembered for their 1993 single \"No Rain\", the group enjoyed critical and commercial success in the early 1990s with their neo-psychedelic take on alternative rock. After releasing two charting albums on Capitol Records and touring extensively, the band was halted in 1995 by the fatal overdose of lead vocalist Shannon Hoon, going on hiatus until officially disbanding four years later and embarking upon new projects. In 2006, the remaining members reunited and recruited new vocalist Travis Warren from the band Rain Fur Rent, producing a fourth album, For My Friends. Warren departed two years later, but again rejoined in 2010, allowing the group to return to performing and recording."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Blues Traveler is an American rock band, formed in Princeton, New Jersey in 1987. The band's music covers a variety of genres, including blues rock, psychedelic rock, folk rock, soul, and Southern rock. They are known for extensive use of segues in their live performances, and were considered a key part of the re-emerging jam band scene of the 1990s, spearheading the H.O.R.D.E. touring music festival. Currently, the group comprises singer and harmonica player John Popper, guitarist Chan Kinchla, drummer Brendan Hill, bassist Tad Kinchla, and keyboardist Ben Wilson. Tad Kinchla and Ben Wilson joined the band following the death of original bassist Bobby Sheehan in 1999. While Blues Traveler is best known among fans for their improvisational live shows, the general public is most familiar with the group from their Top 40 singles \"Run-Around\" and \"Hook\". They gained mainstream popularity after their fourth studio album four, released in 1994. Sheehan's death and Popper's struggle with obesity put a damper on the group's success, and A&M dropped the band in 2002. However, the band took this transition period as an opportunity to start in new directions musically, going largely independent and releasing on smaller experimental labels. In March 2012, Blues Traveler released a double-disc compilation entitled 25 on Hip-O Records; the album commemorates the band's silver anniversary and includes their hit singles, new covers, and previously unreleased b-side material. Blues Traveler's most recent studio album Blow Up the Moon, is the twelfth studio album and was released on April 7, 2015. As part of the Blow Up the Moon album, Blues Traveler released a music video using Rockstar editor in Grand Theft Auto V on September 14, 2015. The music video\u0081 features JC Chasez and 3OH!3."@en ;

The original version of the Flecktones consist of B\u00E9la Fleck on acoustic and electric banjo, Victor Wooten on bass guitar, his brother, Roy Wooten (a.k.a. Future Man) on Drumitar, and Howard Levy on harmonica and keyboard. Levy departed in 1992, and the group continued as a trio for several years until sax player Jeff Coffin joined. Coffin departed in 2010 to join the Dave Matthews Band, and Levy rejoined in 2011. The Flecktones have toured extensively since then, often playing over 200 concerts per year.

Their music has been variously described as bordering on folk and folk rock, traditional Irish, Celtic and new-age, often incorporating elements of an even broader spectrum of smooth jazz and Gregorian chant. After twelve years of success in the folk music industry, they shot to international recognition in 1982 with the release of the \"Theme from Harry's Game\", becoming the most successful band in the Celtic music genre. They subsequently went on to bridge the gap between traditional Celtic music and pop music in the 1980s and 1990s with albums such as Macalla and Anam. Their records usually consist of traditional Gaelic ballads, new-age tracks that carry the group's trademark of haunting vocal harmonies, mellow harp-based instrumentals and often upbeat pop-flavoured numbers. During their career they toured the world extensively and gained fans in every major territory. They have recorded in six different languages, most notably in Irish, and their record sales have exceeded the 15 million mark. They are also widely regarded as the band which, for the first time, put Irish traditional music and the Irish language on the world stage and paved the way for many other Irish artists. They have won several notable awards throughout their career, including a Grammy, a BAFTA, an Ivor Novello and a Billboard Music Award. Clannad are a family band composed of siblings Moya Brennan, Ciar\u00E1n Brennan, P\u00F3l Brennan, who left in 1990 and rejoined in 2011) and their twin uncles Noel Duggan and P\u00E1draig Duggan (died 9 August 2016). Their sister/niece Enya (Irish: Eithne N\u00ED Bhraon\u00E1in) left the group in 1981 to pursue a solo career. Ten years after \"taking a break\", the five original members of Clannad reunited on stage at the Celtic Connections Festival in February 2007 in Glasgow, Scotland. Moya, Ciar\u00E1n, Noel and P\u00E1draig embarked on their first UK tour in over 10 years in March 2008, starting in Gateshead.

The group's music incorporates aspects of progressive rock, pop, heavy metal, and post-hardcore. Most of Coheed and Cambria's albums are concept albums based on a science fiction storyline called The Amory Wars, a series written by Claudio Sanchez, which has been transcribed into a series of comic books as well as a full-length novel. The band has released eight studio albums, three live albums, and several special-edition releases. Their most recent release, The Color Before the Sun, is the band's first non-conceptual album since their inception. It reached #10 on the Billboard 200. Its predecessors The Afterman: Descension; Year of the Black Rainbow and Good Apollo, I'm Burning Star IV, Volume One: From Fear Through The Eyes of Madness all reached the top 10 as well."@en ;

The band's musical style evolved from black metal to a cleaner and more \"produced\" amalgam of gothic metal, symphonic metal and other metal genres. Their lyrical themes and imagery are heavily influenced by gothic literature, poetry, mythology and horror films. The band has broken free from its original niche by courting mainstream publicity (often to the chagrin of its early fanbase), giving the band a \"commercial\" image. This increased accessibility has brought coverage from the likes of Kerrang! and MTV, along with frequent main stage appearances at major festivals such as Ozzfest, Download and even the mainstream Sziget Festival. They have sometimes been perceived as satanic by casual observers, even though their outright lyrical references to Satanism are few and far between; their use of satanic imagery has arguably always been more for shock value rather than any seriously held beliefs."@en ;

The founding members were singer-songwriter and guitarist Dave Matthews, bassist Stefan Lessard, drummer/backing vocalist Carter Beauford and saxophonist LeRoi Moore. Boyd Tinsley was added to the band as a violinist soon after the band was formed. Moore died suddenly in August 2008 due to complications from injuries sustained in an ATV accident. Grammy Award-winner Jeff Coffin (of B\u00E9la Fleck and the Flecktones) has since filled Moore's spot as the band's saxophonist. Rashawn Ross and Tim Reynolds have also become full-time touring members of the band. The band's 2009 album Big Whiskey & the GrooGrux King (the first album since Moore's death) debuted at number one on the Billboard 200, earning the band their fifth consecutive number-one debut. Their most recent album, Away from the World, released September 29, 2012, debuted at number one on the Billboard chart \u2014 making them the only group to have six consecutive studio albums debut in the top spot. As of 2010, the Dave Matthews Band sold over 30 million records worldwide. The band is known for their annual summer-long tours of the United States and Europe, featuring lengthy improvisational renditions of their songs, accompanied by an elaborate video and lighting show. The band is known for playing the songs differently each time. This portion of the tour has become a stamp of DMB and has grown with the band since Fenton Williams began working with them in the early 1990s."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Deftones is an American alternative metal band from Sacramento, California. Formed in 1988, the band was founded by Chino Moreno (lead vocals, rhythm guitar), Stephen Carpenter (lead guitar), Abe Cunningham (drums and percussion) and Dominic Garcia (bass). During the group's first five years, the band's lineup changed several times, but stabilized in 1993 when Cunningham rejoined the group after his departure in 1990. Cunningham replaced John Taylor, who had replaced Garcia after he had switched to drums in 1990, and the bassist role had been filled by Chi Cheng. The lineup remained stable for fifteen years, with the exception of keyboardist and turntablist Frank Delgado being added in 1999. In 2008, Cheng was involved in an automobile accident that ended his stint with Deftones and eventually took his life in 2013. He has been replaced by Sergio Vega. The band is known as one of the most experimental groups to have come from the alternative metal music scene. Deftones have released eight albums since their inception. After the lineup settled in 1993, the band secured a recording contract with Maverick Records, and subsequently released their debut album, Adrenaline, in 1995. Promoting the album by touring exhaustively with other bands in the scene, Deftones managed to gain a dedicated fan base through word of mouth. Their sophomore album, Around the Fur, was released in 1997. The album and its singles reached chart positions, and the album was the band's first to receive certification from the RIAA. The band found even further success with their third album, White Pony, in 2000. It showed a transition away from the band's earlier sound into a more experimental direction. Its lead single, \"Change (In the House of Flies)\", is the group's most commercially successful single, and the album track \"Elite\" won a Grammy Award for Best Metal Performance. White Pony was the band's first album to be certified platinum in the United States. Their self-titled fourth album was released in 2003. While the group's mainstream success continued, sales proved to be lackluster compared to White Pony. The follow-up, Saturday Night Wrist, was released in 2006 after a temporary falling out within the band due to creative tensions. Its completion was also delayed by personal issues within the band, some of which influenced its material. In 2008, while Deftones were working on an album tentatively titled Eros, Cheng was involved in a traffic collision. As a result, he was left in a minimally conscious state until his death in 2013 of cardiac arrest. During that time, Deftones halted production on Eros and released Diamond Eyes and Koi No Yokan in 2010 and 2012 respectively, with current bassist Vega. In 2016, the band released a followup, titled Gore."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Duran Duran are an English new wave/synthpop band formed in Birmingham in 1978. The most successful period for the band spanned from the early 1980s to the mid-1990s. The group were a leading band in the MTV-driven \"Second British Invasion\" of the US. They have placed 14 singles in the Top 10 of the UK Singles Chart and 21 in the Billboard Hot 100, and have sold over 70 million records. When they first emerged, they were generally considered part of the New Romantic scene, along with bands such as Spandau Ballet. Soon they would shed this image, using fashion and marketing to build a more refined and elegant presentation. The band has won a number of awards throughout their career: two Brit Awards including the 2004 award for Outstanding Contribution to Music, two Grammy Awards, and an MTV Video Music Award for Lifetime Achievement. They were also awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. The video age catapulted Duran Duran into the mainstream with the introduction of the 24-hour music channel MTV. Many of their videos were shot on 35 mm film, which gave a much more polished look than was standard at the time. They also collaborated with professional film directors to take the quality a step further, often teaming up with Australian Russell Mulcahy for some of their most memorable video offerings. In 1984, the band were early innovators with video technology in their live stadium shows. The group was formed by keyboardist Nick Rhodes and bassist John Taylor, with the later addition of drummer Roger Taylor, and after numerous personnel changes, guitarist Andy Taylor and lead singer Simon Le Bon. These five members featured in their most commercially successful line-up. The group has never disbanded, but after separation of Andy Taylor in 1986, the line-up has changed to include former Missing Persons American guitarist Warren Cuccurullo from 1989 to 2001 and American drummer Sterling Campbell from 1989 to 1991. The reunion of the original five members in the early 2000s created a stir among the band's fans and music media. Andy Taylor left the band once again in mid-2006, and guitarist Dom Brown has since been working with the band as a session player and touring member."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Earth, Wind & Fire (EWF) is an American band that has spanned the musical genres of R&B, soul, funk, jazz, disco, pop, rock, Latin and African. They are one of the most successful bands of all time. Rolling Stone Magazine described them as \"innovative, precise yet sensual, calculated yet galvanizing\" and declared that the band \"changed the sound of black pop\". The band was founded in Chicago by Maurice White in 1971, having grown out of a previous band known as The Salty Peppers. Other members have included Philip Bailey, Verdine White, Ralph Johnson, Larry Dunn, Al McKay and Andrew Woolfolk. The band has received 20 Grammy nominations; they won six as a group and two of its members, Maurice White and Bailey, won separate individual awards. Earth, Wind & Fire have 12 American Music Awards nominations and four awards. They have been inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and the Vocal Group Hall of Fame, received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, and sold over 100 million records, making them one of the world's best-selling bands of all time. Five members of Earth, Wind & Fire were also inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame: Maurice White, Philip Bailey, Verdine White, Larry Dunn and Al McKay. The music industry and fans have bestowed Lifetime Achievement honors from the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers (Rhythm & Soul Heritage Award \u2013 2002), NAACP (Hall of Fame \u2013 1994) and the BET Awards (Lifetime Achievement Award \u2013 2002). Earth, Wind & Fire is known for the dynamic sound of their horn section, their energetic and elaborate stage shows, and the interplay between the contrasting vocals of Philip Bailey's falsetto and Maurice White's tenor. The kalimba (African thumb piano) is played on all of the band's albums. In the 1970s and early 1980s, the band had many hits, including \"Shining Star\", \"That's the Way of the World\", \"Devotion\", \"Reasons\", \"Sing a Song\", \"Can't Hide Love\", \"Getaway\", \"Fantasy\", \"Love's Holiday\", \"September\", \"Boogie Wonderland\", \"After the Love Has Gone\", and \"Let's Groove\". Two Earth, Wind & Fire classic songs have been inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame: \"That\u2019s the Way of the World\" (2004) and \"Shining Star\" (2007). The band is also known as having been the first African-American act to sell out Madison Square Garden and to receive the MSG Gold Ticket Award. President Barack Obama invited Earth, Wind & Fire to perform at the White House for the first social event of the new administration."@en ;

The original line-up consisted of vocalist Ian McCulloch, guitarist Will Sergeant and bass player Les Pattinson, supplemented by a drum machine. By 1980, Pete de Freitas joined as the band's drummer. Their 1980 debut album, Crocodiles, went into the top 20 of the UK Albums Chart. The band's cult status was followed by mainstream success in 1983 as they scored a UK Top 10 hit with \"The Cutter\", and the attendant album, Porcupine, which reached number 2 in the UK. Ocean Rain (1984), continued the band's UK chart success, and has since been regarded as one of the landmark releases of the post-punk movement, with the single \"The Killing Moon\". In 1988, the band split. In 1989, de Freitas was killed in a motorcycle accident and the band briefly re-emerged with a new singer. After working together as Electrafixion, McCulloch and Sergeant regrouped with Pattinson in 1997 and returned as Echo & the Bunnymen."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Finntroll is a folk metal band from Helsinki, Finland. They combine elements of black metal and folk metal. Finntroll's lyrics are mostly in Swedish, the only exception being the song \"Madon Laulu\" on Visor Om Slutet. Finntroll's original singer, Katla, decided to use Swedish over Finnish since he was part of a Swedish-speaking minority in Finland and the sound of the language seemed to better suit the band's \"trollish\" outfit. Despite several vocalist changes, this tradition has continued. According to bandmembers Vreth and Skrymer, they took their name from an old Finnish legend where Swedish priests coming to Finland had an encounter with a wild-looking man who killed most of their party. The survivors came back bearing the tale of the Finn-Troll. Finntroll's lyrics mainly deal with legends and tales revolving around the fictional Troll-King \"Rivfader\" and the trolls fighting against the Christians who entered their lands and spread their beliefs. A recurring theme is the story of two priests named \"Aamund\" and \"Kettil\". The first three full-length albums feature a rather short but fierce song about the two men who constantly get themselves into trouble with the trolls, only to get beaten up and mutilated over and over again by the wrathful followers of Rivfader. To date, the band's discography includes six full-length albums, a live album and two EPs. Their newest studio album Blodsvept was released on March 22, 2013. In 2014, the band released the live album Natten Med De Levande Finntroll (\"Night of the Living Finntroll\")."@en ;

The group released their debut album Beg for Mercy, in 2003, which went on to sell over 2,000,000 copies in the US and was certified Double Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). The album, which followed the critical and commercial success of 50 Cent's major-label debut Get Rich or Die Tryin', served as a platform for Banks, Buck & Yayo to release their respective solo debut albums, The Hunger for More (2004), Straight Outta Cashville (2004) & Thoughts of a Predicate Felon (2005). In 2008, the group released their second album T\u00B7O\u00B7S (Terminate on Sight). During Tony Yayo's imprisonment, the group recruited Tennessee-based rapper Young Buck, who was featured throughout the Beg for Mercy album. In late 2004, The Game was also added to the group, a proposition made by Dr. Dre and Jimmy Iovine, to promote the Aftermath/Interscope newcomer. However, due to The Game's \"disloyalty\" in the eyes of 50 Cent, he was soon removed from the group. In April 2008, 50 Cent revealed Young Buck was no longer a part of the group due to his \"excessive spending\" and \"inconsistent behavior\". In early 2014, after Yayo and 50 Cent separately stated G-Unit was no more, the original members of the group reconciled and reunited at Summer Jam 2014, along with Young Buck after his six-year departure from the group. G-Unit Records rapper Kidd Kidd, was also added to the group upon its reformation."@en ;

They first came to notice with the song \"Hey Jealousy\" from their first major label album, New Miserable Experience (1992), but this achievement was coupled with the forced firing and eventual suicide of the song's author and band co-founder Doug Hopkins, prompting the title of their follow-up album, Congratulations I'm Sorry (1996). After a series of charting singles, the band broke up in 1997. They reunited in 2002 and released a fourth album, Major Lodge Victory, in 2006, and a fifth, No Chocolate Cake, in 2010."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Guided by Voices (often abbreviated as GBV) is an American indie rock band originating from Dayton, Ohio. It has made frequent personnel changes but always maintained the presence of principal songwriter Robert Pollard. Noted at first for its lo-fi aesthetic and typically Portastudio four-tracks-to-cassette production methods, Guided by Voices' music reveals influences from post\u2013British Invasion garage rock, psychedelic rock, progressive rock, punk rock and post-punk. The band has also garnered much attention for its prolific output, with a seemingly endless stream of releases. Most songs are in the two-minute range, but many are even shorter; often they end abruptly or are intertwined with odd and homemade sound effects. Guided by Voices initially disbanded in 2004, but in 2010 the \"classic lineup\" reunited to perform at Matador Records 21st anniversary party, subsequently touring and releasing six new albums. GBV broke up a second time in late 2014, but Pollard again rebooted the band with a new album and a new lineup in February 2016."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Helloween is a German power metal band founded in 1984 in Hamburg, Northern Germany. The band is a pioneering force in the power metal genre, and their second and third studio albums, Keeper of the Seven Keys: Part I and Part II, are considered masterpieces of the genre. Twelve musicians have been a part of the band's line-up in its history, which has consisted of singer Andi Deris, guitarists Michael Weikath and Sascha Gerstner, bass guitarist Markus Grosskopf, and drummer Daniel L\u00F6ble since 2005. Helloween was formed in 1984 by members of bands Iron Fist, Gentry, and Powerfool. Its first line-up consisted of Weikath, Grosskopf, singer and guitarist Kai Hansen, and drummer Ingo Schwichtenberg. After the release of a self-titled EP and a first album in 1985, it expanded into a quintet when singer Michael Kiske joined, with Hansen only acting as guitarist. Under this line-up, they released the Keeper of the Seven Keys albums (1987 and 1988), which established Helloween as a notable heavy metal band and led to the creation of the power metal subgenre. However, Hansen left the band quickly after the release of Part II and was replaced by Roland Grapow. He then created the band Gamma Ray. Helloween's first two albums without Hansen, Pink Bubbles Go Ape (1991) and Chameleon (1993), were commercial and critical failures, which created tensions between band members and led to the firing of Schwichtenberg and Kiske. They were replaced by Uli Kusch and Andi Deris respectively. The albums released under this line-up, consisting of Master of the Rings (1994), The Time of the Oath (1996), Better Than Raw (1998) and The Dark Ride (2000), received a warm reception from both fans and critics, gradually establishing Helloween as a successful band again. However, tensions following the release of The Dark Ride led to the dismissals of both Grapow and Kusch, who then went on to found Masterplan together. Grapow was replaced by Gerstner, but the attempts to find a new drummer were chaotic and no band member was credited for drums on the album Rabbit Don't Come Easy (2003). The band finally found a stable drummer in L\u00F6ble in 2005. Under this new and current line-up, the longest in its history, the band has released four successful studio albums: Keeper of the Seven Keys: The Legacy (2005), Gambling with the Devil (2007), 7 Sinners (2010), and Straight Out of Hell (2013), with all members except L\u00F6ble contributing to songwriting. Their fifteenth studio album, My God-Given Right, was released on 29 May 2015. Since its creation, Helloween has released fifteen studio albums, three live albums, three EPs, and twenty-seven singles, and has sold more than eight million records worldwide."@en ;
