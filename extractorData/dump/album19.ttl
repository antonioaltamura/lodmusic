The album was preceded in October 2013 by the single and album opening track \"Cavalier\". The single's video was directed by Irish director Aoife McArdle, one of three short films she made for the album. Asked about the dramatic change in direction, McMorrow said he consciously sought to move away from the sound of his debut, and had no interest in repeating himself. He believes that musicians have a responsibility \"to make new and interesting things. And not just go, 'Well that works, so I'm just gonna...'\" The song \"Glacier\" was included in an emotional Spanish Christmas Lottery ('El Gordo') advert, aired in November 2014, in which someone who hadn't bought a lottery ticket from the bar he always went to, tears up when the barman charges him with 21 euros; \"1 for the coffee and 20 for this lottery ticket\"."@en ;

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/12_Stories>	rdf:type	schema:MusicAlbum ;
	dbo:abstract	"12 Stories is the full-length debut studio album by American country music singer-songwriter Brandy Clark. It was released on October 22, 2013 on the Dallas-based Slate Creek Records label. Clark wrote or co-wrote all 12 of the songs and it features Vince Gill on background vocals. When Clark first moved to Nashville around 1997 she wanted to be a recording artist, but instead concentrated on her song writing which is her true passion. It took her many years to hone a voice as an individual artist with a view to creating songs which would be commercially viable and which people wanted to listen to. She played occasional gigs and made demo tapes enough to finance an EP to sell at songwriters\u2019 night shows. In 2010 her two co-managers heard that EP and told her they would help finance a full studio record along with a management company. As a respected Music Row songwriter she was also encouraged by friends in the business to release a batch of her own material. The songs on this album were know to and recorded by her 2 years before its release date. Previous to this and during that time span she had become a part of a tight circle of friends and regular song collaborators that included singing songwriters Miranda Lambert, Ashley Monroe, Kacey Musgraves, Shane McAnally, Josh Osborne and Trevor Rosen, some of whom contribute to the album. The song \u201CStripes\u201D was co-written with Shane McAnally at a songwriters retreat at Center Hill Lake. It was released in America as a single which premiered on Sirius XM Radio Radio. The official video made its CMT debut on July 4, 2013. The release of the album coincides with a breakthrough year for Clark after being named as one of CMT's Next Women of Country and gaining well-deserved attention after scoring a CMA Song of the Year nomination for her contribution to \u201CMama\u2019s Broken Heart\u201D and enjoying chart-topping success as a writer of The Band Perry\u2019s No.1 song \u201CBetter Dig Two.\u201D The songs on 12 Stories are mostly ones which were admired by, but not recorded by other artists, possibly due to the provocative storytelling and their daring content, which is a Clark trademark."@en ;

According to frontman Nero Bellum, it is supposedly also Psyclon Nine's final album. In an interview Nero had this to say about the album: \"The trilogy came to me in a dream. Let\u2019s put it this way, Order of the Shadow is the last Psyclon Nine record, although I may add installments to it, which is why I labeled it Act I. I always knew this would be the last record, so let\u2019s see what happens.\" Nero Bellum worked closely with Chris Vrenna (formerly of Nine Inch Nails and Marilyn Manson) on the production of the album. It continued the industrial black metal fusion previously heard on We the Fallen, but was heavily influenced by industrial rock, notably Marilyn Manson's Antichrist Superstar and Nine Inch Nails's The Downward Spiral."@en ;

The three piece line-up recorded the EP which put the band into the Elite black metal scene of Norway, but due to the distance between Frost, Attila and Obsidian C., this line-up was short-lived. Attila did all the vocals on this release. However, Obsidian C. performed additional vocals on Come Damnation and Reclaim. Obsidian C. is also responsible for writing the music, except for IX which was written by Obsidian C. and S. Groenbech. Traveler was written, but also performed by S. Groenbech alone.

It was not well received by critics and sold poorly (peaking on the Billboard 200 at #114), though the live performances of the material were much better received. Many hardcore Kinks fans were alienated by Ray Davies' melodramatic songwriting during the Preservation project era, resulting in albums that played more like the soundtracks to a piece of musical theatre than rock albums; however, many Kinks' fans welcomed the imaginative concept and cite the two albums as extremely creative and some of Davies' best work.[citation needed] The 1991 CD reissue on Rhino was a 2-CD set combining Preservation: Act 2 with its 1973 predecessor Preservation: Act 1, but with no bonus tracks.

	dbo:abstract	"Bedtime Stories is the sixth studio album by American singer Madonna. It was released on October 25, 1994, by Maverick Records. Madonna collaborated with Dallas Austin, Babyface, Dave \"Jam\" Hall, and Nellee Hooper, deciding to move into more mainstream sound. The singer wanted to soften her image following the critical and commercial backlash she faced after releasing sexually explicit projects in the previous two years, notably the Erotica album and the Sex book in 1992. The success of the soundtrack single \"I'll Remember\" in 1994 marked the beginning of this transformation and Madonna used Bedtime Stories to continue it. Bedtime Stories is a pop album which was inspired by contemporary R&B. Like its predecessor Erotica, the album explores lyrical themes of love, sorrow, and romance, but with a toned-down, less sexual approach. Critics described the album as \"autobiographical\", as the song \"Human Nature\" addresses the controversy surrounding Erotica. Madonna also worked with Icelandic singer-songwriter Bj\u00F6rk, as she wanted to explore the British club musical scene, where genres such as dub had been growing in popularity. Bedtime Stories received generally favorable reviews from music critics, who praised the album's candid lyrics and production, and was nominated for Best Pop Album at the 38th Grammy Awards. Commercially, the album proved to be successful. Debuting and peaking at number three on the Billboard 200, the album was certified triple-platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America. It also became her fifth number-one album in Australia and peaked within the top five in other international territories. Bedtime Stories has sold more than seven million copies worldwide. The lead single from the album, \"Secret\", gave Madonna her record-breaking 35th consecutive top ten single on the UK Singles Chart, while \"Take a Bow\" spent seven weeks at number one on the US Billboard Hot 100. Other singles released, \"Bedtime Story\" and \"Human Nature\", did not match the previous singles' success. In order to further promote Bedtime Stories, Madonna performed songs from the album on the American Music Awards of 1995 and the 1995 Brit Awards. A concert tour was also planned, but did not happen due to Madonna's major role on Evita."@en ;

Smith rose to fame after her appearance on the second series of Britain's Got Talent, and signed with Universal after the competition. The album was recorded during December 2008 and January 2009 and features the track \"River of Light\", a song set to The Blue Danube with newly written lyrics. Faryl was produced by Jon Cohen, and the backing music was provided by a 60-piece orchestra. As part of the album's promotion, Smith made numerous television and radio appearances and filmed a music video for \"River of Light\". Around this time, she met with then-Prime Minister Gordon Brown at 10 Downing Street. After its release, Faryl became the fastest-selling classical solo album in British chart history, selling 20,000 copies in the first four days, and a total of 29,200 copies in the first week, higher than any other debut album of a classical singer. Faryl entered the UK Albums Chart at number 6, rising to number 4 the next week, and was the third album by a Britain's Got Talent contestant to reach the top ten in Britain. Smith subsequently embarked on a promotional tour in the US to publicise the album, where it reached number 6 on the classical chart. Faryl was fairly well received by critics, who praised Smith's performances and Cohen's production. However, criticism was directed at the use of the orchestra and at the song choices. As one of the ten best-selling classical albums in the UK in 2009, Faryl was nominated for a Classical BRIT Award in the album of the year category, but lost to Only Men Aloud's Band of Brothers. In 2013, the album was certified gold by the British Phonographic Industry."@en ;

The album was recorded at Bieler Bros. Studios in Pompano Beach, Florida, produced by Jason Bieler, and mixed by Martyn \"Ginge\" Ford and Jeff Rose at Not-In-Pill Studios, Newport, Wales. This album was released in two different versions: the standard edition, which was released as a CD and included eleven tracks and a small illustrated booklet with lyrics; and the special edition, which was digitally released and included the eleven album tracks plus four bonus tracks (one non-album track and three live tracks). The self-titled debut album sold around 900 copies in the US in its first week of release, landing at position No. 41 on the \"Top New Artist Albums (Heatseekers)\" chart. This is the only full-length record Mutiny Within had with Roadrunner Records and former drummer Bill Fore; he parted ways from the band months after the album release, on July 7, 2010. Wishing him the best of luck on moving forward, he was temporarily replaced with 25-year-old Chad Anthony, who is also from New Jersey. They were searching for a permanent drummer for a few months, and to do so, they cancelled their touring with Nevermore to take the time to properly audition and rehearse. The band first decided to break up in late 2011, amidst the production of their self-produced second studio album. However, in early 2012, founding member, bassist and main songwriter Andrew Jacobs and singer Chris Clancy decided to finish their album as their last work together and as a gift to the fans, which was finished on late 2012, and released digitally on January 12, 2013 under the name of Mutiny Within II: Synchronicity. After the positive response of their work, they decided to continue making music together."@en ;

OOPARTS collects every song released by SYUN, a \"group\" created by Susumu Hirasawa at the time, which were 9 songs spread over 4 releases over 4 years and 3 labels. The songs are experimental variations of the P-MODEL sound in their nature (referred to in the obi strip as \"ascetic techno\") and feature heavy use of sampling, with importance placed in the \"atmosphere\" (which led to people who, by chance, were present during the recordings, being credited as members). It received the title OOPARTS due to the songs being heavy in their use of samples, which was an uncommon way of music making when they were created. Hirasawa mentions in the album's liner notes that the songs haven't aged well, losing their original uniqueness and shock value, now being only shoddily, poorly edited songs. The album was remastered by Masanori Chinzei and re-released on the HALDYN DOME box set on 29 February 2012."@en ;

The album was released on 2 June 2008 in Europe, after having the September 2007 release rescheduled (initially to March 2008) as a result of the purchase of Sanctuary Records by Universal Music. This was to allow proper promotion of the album, rather than it be 'lost' during the changeover and, although frustrating for them, was something the band members supported. Wake the Sleeper was released in the U.S.A. on 26 August 2008. This album will also be released as a 12\" vinyl album in a gatefold sleeve. The song \"What Kind of God\" was inspired by the book \"Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee\" by Dee Brown (1970), which refers to the Wounded Knee Massacre.[citation needed] Wake the Sleeper was nominated by Classic Rock Magazine as the Album of the Year.[citation needed] On the supporting tour the band would generally play all songs from the album, interspersed with songs from their past releases.[citation needed]"@en ;

Although their fifteenth studio album, it is their eighth in their \"canon\" of studio albums (albums of new, lyrical material still in print). The release follows the successful Arrogance Ignorance and Greed (2009) and the limited edition albums Covers 2 (2010) and Backlog 2 (2011). Recorded and produced by Mark Tucker, the album takes a strong influence from both English and American folk music and was created as a \"journey through of [the two countries'] landscapes united by a common tongue and musical heritage\". The album again features their unofficial third member Miranda Sykes. The album was also described by Knightley as a direct continuation of Arrogance Ignorance and Greed, although critics saw it as very distinct in its own right. The album was also a 20th anniversary celebration for the duo. Released in October 2012 by the band's own label Hands on Music, it charted at number 73 in the UK Albums Chart, some 100 higher places than their only other album to chart at the time, Arrogance Ignorance and Greed. It was released to very positive reviews from critics, with some touting it as the duo's best album. The duo toured in promotion of the album from 2012\u221214, although several songs from the album had debuted live in 2010. A 7-inch single featuring alternative versions of \"Aunt Maria\" and \"King of the World\" was released in 2013, whilst a rockumentary documenting the making of the album, Making the Waking, was released as a double-feature DVD release in 2013 with a concert film taken from the album's promotional tour, Live at Shrewsbury, which was a collaboration with the Urban Soul Orchestra."@en ;

dbr:Leave_Your_Soul_to_Science	rdf:type	schema:MusicAlbum ;
	dbo:abstract	"Leave Your Soul to Science is the sixth studio album by Melbourne band Something for Kate, released in September 28, 2012. The album debuted at No.5 on the ARIA Charts. The album was produced by John Congleton, whose previous credits include Okkervil River, Shearwater and The New Pornographers and recorded at his Elmwood studio in Dallas, Texas. Frontman Paul Dempsey told The Age the band had been looking for someone to tell them when enough was enough. \"We recognised an inclination or proclivity among ourselves to procrastinate and keep layering stuff up,\" he said. \"We knew that we needed to fight that instinct and he was very much the guy to help us.\" He told the Hobart Mercury Congleton was \"the perfect guy for our new-found relaxed attitude\": \"He's a real experimenter and we were feeling very experimental ourselves. The four of us would just sit around and throw out ideas, and do the strangest, dumbest things and see what worked. Whenever we thought something was weird and interesting but we weren't sure about it, we'd just run with it any sort of uncertainty was a good thing. We ran with the uncertainty and embraced the feeling of not being 100 per cent sure of everything we were doing.\" Dempsey said he had been unsatisfied with the way some songs on previous albums had been captured. \"In previous years we were concerned with being perfectionists, and trying to make everything just so. What we realised after a long time is that that actually can end up sucking the life out of things, and that perhaps the better way to do things is to fly by the seat of your pants and rely on the spontaneous energy of the moment. Some of our past records have suffered a bit from too much nitpicking, and this latest record really has zero nitpicking. There's plenty of audible mistakes and weird moments where we just went fuck it, just leave it, it's all part of what happens when you hit record.\" Dempsey said the album's lyrics contained an abundance of often cryptic black humour. He said he found the lyrics of \"This Economy\", a song of lost love set in the context of the global financial crisis, \"hilariously funny\". \"The song reeks of (disgraced businessman) Bernie Madoff and it reeks of young Wall Street executives who equate the size of their wallets with the success of their human relationships,\" he said. Dempsey said he was not bothered if people misunderstood his lyrics. \"If my humour doesn't translate, there shouldn't need to be a press release letting everyone know that I'm funny.\" The album's cover and inner book photography was by bassist Stephanie Ashworth."@en ;

The album marks a progression of the sound in their previous album Digital Renegade, with Zach Johnson having a much bigger vocal role, as well as having a much more prominent EDM sound. Despite this, Devin Oliver sings mostly lead on the songs \"Murder Mitten\" and \"Judith Rules\". The song \"Violent Bounce\" was the first single to be released. It was uploaded to YouTube via the Sumerian Records channel. \"Murder Mitten\" and the title track, \"New Demons\", were to follow. The band did performances of the song \"Ten Thousand Feet\" to give fans a taste of what is going to be on the rest of the album before its release. Klayton of Celldweller, Mutrix, and Razihel all provided additional programming for some of the tracks. It is the final album to feature rhythm guitarist Jimmy Gregerson and unclean vocalist/keyboardist Zach Johnson before they both departed from the band in 2015.

	dbo:abstract	"Free Dimensional, released on October 23, 2012, is the second album from Canadian musician Diamond Rings (real name: John O'Regan). According to O'Regan, his Diamond Rings persona exists \"to sort of smash that kind of tendency that I think we all have to sort of hide behind ourselves. And I think this record's probably, or definitely, my strongest statement that I've made to date.\" He also says a big part of this album was \"becoming more comfortable as a musician and a composer and an arranger\", and \"I felt like I really stepped up as a singer with this album, and I\u2019m really proud of that.\u201D O'Regan has stated that this album is more polished than Special Affections, but \"I didn\u2019t really change my approach lyrically or emotionally. I feel like they\u2019re still conveying the same message, but just coated in a way that has a few more layers of gloss. It\u2019s like we spent a two more hours waxing the car.\" He attributes the album's heavier dance orientation to his unique recording set-up: \"I had a sit-down desk and I got rid of it cause I started working all day on these songs and I started feeling really sluggish, like I was a banker or something. So I got rid of the desk, put my computer up, and started recording like that. And it just all has a more dance-ready feel because I was dancing when I was making it!\" O'Regan has compared Special Affections to Free Dimensional: \"The old album is more introspective, whereas Free Dimensional seems outrospective. It's got all this energy coming out of it.\""@en ;

It was released in the United Kingdom on October 29, 1971 by CBS Records (see 1971 in music) as a follow-up to the band's first compilation album, The Byrds' Greatest Hits. The album appeared following the band's successful appearance at the Lincoln Folk Festival on July 24, 1971 and may have been issued by CBS as a reaction to the band's previous studio album, Byrdmaniax, having failed to chart in the UK. The album gathered together many of the singles that The Byrds had issued in the UK since the release of their first compilation in 1967, and as a result, it is the first album to feature the band's recording of Bob Dylan's \"Lay Lady Lay\", which had been issued as a non-album single in May 1969. Most of the tracks on the album were originally released between 1968 and 1971, but the song \"The Times They Are a-Changin'\" dated from 1965, despite that era of the band's career having already been covered by The Byrds' first greatest hits album. The Byrds' Greatest Hits Volume II failed to reach the UK Albums Chart but its critical reception was generally warm, with the NME describing the compilation as \"an indispensable acquisition for any student of the cream of American rock, particularly of the roots and influences.\" Nonetheless, a number of contemporary reviews also made note of the album's inaccurate and misleading title, since among the twelve tracks included, only the song \"Chestnut Mare\" had been a genuine hit in the UK.

	dbo:abstract	"A Year Without Rain is the second studio album by American band Selena Gomez & the Scene. The album was released on September 21, 2010 via Hollywood Records. For songwriting, staffwriters were hired to write all the lyrics. The band once again worked with writers and producers from their debut, Kiss & Tell such as Rock Mafia duo Tim James and Antonina Armato, as well as Fefe Dobson, Toby Gad, and Superspy. New contributions came from Kevin Rudolf, Katy Perry, Jonas Jeberg and RedOne among others. Due to the success of their breakout hit, \"Naturally\", the album draws mainly from dance-pop and synthpop, rather than the pop rock and electronic rock sound of Kiss & Tell. While making use of the Auto-Tune effect, the album also infuses influences of several other genres, including dancehall and Eurodance, among others. According to Gomez, most of the songs on the album are dedicated to the fans, while she wanted content with more melodies and empowering lyrics. Lyrical themes include topics of love, freedom, and the joy of living in the moment. The album has been given mixed to positive reviews and critics noting it as an improvement from the band's debut album. A Year Without Rain debuted in the United States at number four, selling 66,000 copies in its first week. The album has so far spawned two top forty singles in the United States, lead single, \"Round & Round\", and the title track \"A Year Without Rain\". In January 2011, the album was certified Gold by RIAA making it the band's second gold selling album."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Anxiety's Kiss is the fifth studio album by the American rock band Coliseum. The album was released on May 5, 2015 through Deathwish Inc. Though Coliseum previously released the \"True Quiet\"/\"Last Wave\" single in 2009 and an expanded reissue of their debut album Coliseum in 2014 through Deathwish, Anxiety's Kiss is the band's first full-length album of new material released through the label. The album was produced by J. Robbins of Jawbox fame, who previously produced Coliseum's 2011 EP Parasites and 2013 studio album Sister Faith. Sonically, Anxiety's Kiss sees the band incorporating more post-punk, industrial music and synthesizers into their post-hardcore sound. When asked how fans might react to Coliseum's new sound for Anxiety's Kiss, vocalist and guitarist Ryan Patterson said: \"Every album changes and everybody is shocked at the time that happens, so I think that's made it difficult for us to really build a big fanbase because every time we put out a record\u2014I don't know if it's alienating everybody\u2014but it's completely erasing the rulebook.\" To promote the album, coinciding with the album's announcement, Coliseum released a music video for the opening track \"We Are the Water\" directed by Max Moore. The announcement was followed by a short February/March 2015 tour, including dates with Old Man Gloom. Coliseum also released a music video for \"Sunlight in a Snowstorm\" and a lyric video for \"Course Correction\" before the album's official release date. The band's first tour directly in support of Anxiety's Kiss will be a June 2015 US tour with United Nations and Child Bite. Timothy Monger of AllMusic gave the album four-out-of-five stars and said, \"Building on the strong foundation of their last album, Anxiety's Kiss adds even more sonic and emotional variety to Coliseum's sound, and is easily their most interesting album to date.\""@en ;

It was released on May 1, 2012. The album contains the complete July 31, 1974 concert, except for \"Seastones\". This musical piece was written by Ned Lagin. It was performed by Lagin and Grateful Dead bassist Phil Lesh between the second and third sets of the concert. \"Seastones\" is a loosely structured composition, partially improvised in performance, that is an early example of electronic music, with many of the sounds generated using synthesizers and computers. Part of the June 28, 1974 performance of \"Seastones\" was included in Dick's Picks Volume 12. Dave's Picks Volume 2 was the second in the Dave's Picks series of Grateful Dead archival releases, the successor to the Road Trips series. It was a limited edition of 12,000 copies, all but 2,500 of which were pre-sold with the 2012 Dave's Picks subscription series. A bonus disc was included with shipments of the album to 2012 Dave's Picks subscribers. This disc contains tracks recorded on July 29, 1974 at the Capital Centre in Landover, Maryland."@en ;

It was released on October 28, 2009 through Napalm Records. \"Goy, Rode, Goy!\" means \"Hail, Rod, Hail!\". Rod is the Slavic Great God, Father ofthe Universe. The album has a large cast of guest vocalists and musicians, most notably on the track \"Na Moyey Zemle\" which features vocalists from M\u00E5negarm of Sweden, Obtest of Lithuania, Menhir of Germany, Skyforger of Latvia, and Heidevolk of the Netherlands. Each sings in their native language, playing the role of warriors from that region describing their homeland to a traveler. The album was also one of the band's few to be released on LP, strictly limited edition, with only 500 printed, each individually hand numbered with blue pen marker. Gatefold, two LPs, plain white inner sleeves, it is all very well put together, released by Napalm Records and made in Germany. There is a reversal of the order of songs \"Pritcha\" and \"Na Moey Zemle\" in comparison to the CD version, leaving four songs to each side of a record except for side B which has only the two."@en ;

dbr:Together_Through_Life	rdf:type	schema:MusicAlbum ;
	dbo:abstract	"Together Through Life is the thirty-third studio album by singer-songwriter Bob Dylan, released on April 28, 2009, by Columbia Records. The album debuted at number one in several countries, including the U.S. and the UK. It is Dylan's first number one in Britain since New Morning in 1970. Dylan wrote all but one of the album's songs with Grateful Dead lyricist Robert Hunter, with whom he had previously co-written two songs on his 1988 album Down in the Groove. In an interview with Rolling Stone magazine, Dylan commented on the collaboration: \u201CHunter is an old buddy, we could probably write a hundred songs together if we thought it was important or the right reasons were there... He's got a way with words and I do too. We both write a different type of song than what passes today for songwriting.\u201D The only other writer Dylan has ever collaborated with to such a degree is Jacques Levy, with whom he wrote most of the songs on Desire in 1976. Rumors of the album, reported in Rolling Stone magazine, came as a surprise, with no official press release until March 16, 2009\u2014less than two months before the album's release date. Dylan produced the record under his pseudonym of Jack Frost, which he used for his previous two studio albums, Love and Theft and Modern Times. The album was rumored to contain \"struggling love songs\" and have little similarity to Modern Times. In a conversation with music journalist Bill Flanagan, published on Bob Dylan's official website, Flanagan suggested a similarity of the new record to the sound of Chess Records and Sun Records, which Dylan acknowledged as an effect of \"the way the instruments were played.\" He said that the genesis of the record was when French film director Olivier Dahan asked him to supply a song for his new road movie, My Own Love Song, which became \"Life is Hard\" - indeed, 'according to Dylan, Dahan was keen to get a whole soundtrack's worth of songs from the man' - and \"then the record sort of took its own direction.\" Dylan is backed on the album by his regular touring band, plus David Hidalgo of Los Lobos and Mike Campbell of Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers. Dylan commented on Campbell's guitar work in his interview with Flanagan: \u201CHe's good with me. He's been playing with Tom for so long that he hears everything from a songwriter\u2019s point of view and he can play most any style.\u201D \"Beyond Here Lies Nothin'\" was available as a free download for one day on Monday, March 30, 2009, via Dylan's official site. \"I Feel a Change Comin' On\" was released for streaming on Monday, April 6 on The Times Online website, as well as the third installment of his interview with Bill Flanagan. In the interview with Bill Flanagan, Dylan discusses the only known outtake to \"Together Through Life\", \"Chicago After Dark\". Apparently, this song was in the running to be on the album but was left off the final version, as Flanagan talks about the song as if it is on the album. The song is not circulating among collectors. The album received two Grammy Award nominations in Best Americana Album category and \"Best Solo Rock Vocal Performance\" category for \"Beyond Here Lies Nothin'\". The album also is significant as the only album by Dylan to top the US and UK charts consecutively. The album's cover photo is the same as that on the cover of American author Larry Brown's short story collection, Big Bad Love."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"9 is the seventh studio album by Public Image Ltd, released in May 1989 on the Virgin Records label (see 1989 in music). The band that recorded 9 consisted of John Lydon, bassist Allan Dias, guitarist John McGeoch and drummer Bruce Smith. Former guitarist Lu Edmonds, who had left the band by the time the album was recorded due to problems with tinnitus, received a writing co-credit on all tracks, although he does not play on the album. The band's replacement for Edmonds, Ted Chau, is also absent. The album was produced by Stephen Hague, Eric \"ET\" Thorngren, and the band. Bill Laswell, who had produced Album three years earlier, had originally been lined up to produce 9, but the tension between him and Lydon after the recording of that album, coupled with Laswell's desire to once again use his own cast of session musicians on 9 and his dissatisfaction with Public Image's new line-up, led to the agreement being cancelled. The first album track to be released was \"Warrior\", which showed up on the soundtrack album to the movie Slaves of New York, released on 20 March 1989. The track \"Sand Castles in the Snow\" was originally titled \"Spit\", and was so listed in various Virgin pre-release information. It reached the Top 40 of the UK Singles Chart at number 38."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Back To Back is the sixteenth studio album by English rock band Status Quo and released in November 1983. For the first time in the group's history, it featured four singles, \"Ol' Rag Blues\" (highest position No. 9), \"A Mess of Blues\", originally a hit for Elvis Presley (No. 15), \"Marguerita Time\" (No. 3), and \"Going Down Town Tonight\" (which reached No. 20 in a different, re-recorded version to the album version.) The album entered the UK chart at its highest position of No. 9. It was the last recorded before the group temporarily disbanded in 1985 and therefore the last to feature original bass guitarist Alan Lancaster and drummer Pete Kircher. Lancaster co-wrote the first single, \"Ol' Rag Blues\", with Keith Lamb, lead singer of British bands The Kase, Sleepy Talk and Mr. Toad, and founder and lead singer of Australia's successful glam rock band Hush. Lancaster was angered when the production company declined to release the version featuring his lead vocal (which has since been made available as a bonus track on the 2005 remastered reissue), in preference to that featuring the voice of Francis Rossi. He also made no secret of his dislike of \"Marguerita Time\", which he thought was too pop-orientated for the group. When they appeared on BBC's Top of the Pops to mime to the single, his place was taken by Jim Lea of Slade, who were also on the programme that week. That Top of the Pops appearance was also notable for Rick Parfitt falling into Pete Kircher's drum set near the end of the song while the song kept playing. On the DVD Hello Quo, Parfitt claims that he had planned this action, although many people thought he was drunk. On the same DVD, Alan Lancaster also said that he wasn't so concerned with \"Marguerita Time\" as he was with \"Going Down Town Tonight\", which - according to him - was not a Status Quo recording and featured no Status Quo musicians apart from Francis Rossi."@en ;

The opening four tracks were recorded in Los Angeles with the producer Dennis Lambert. Two more tracks were recorded there with Richard James Burgess, who had produced on their previous album. The rest of the album was made up of songs written by the band members with the writers producing their own tracks with their father, Buster Pearson, in London. Deniece sings lead on all tracks except \"You Should Have Waited\" (sung by Lorraine) and \"Knock Twice\" (sung by Doris). The album did not sell as well as its predecessor, Silk & Steel, and spent only two weeks in the top 10, and 17 weeks on the UK Albums Chart altogether. However, the album was certified Platinum for sales of over 300,000 copies by summer 1988. It did not chart at all in the US. The first single, \"Whenever You're Ready\", was released the week before the album in the UK and peaked at number 11 in the UK Singles Chart but only managed to reach number 39 on the US Hot R&B Singles chart, missing the Billboard Hot 100. The ballad \"Strong as Steel\", written by Diane Warren, was the second single but fared even worse, peaking at number 16 in the UK in October and not charting at all in the US. When the third UK single, \"Somewhere Somebody\", failed to reach the top 20 in December of that year (peaking at #23), promotion of the album ended with no further singles released (there had been seven and six UK singles from their previous albums). Having released a single almost every two months since 1985, the band took a five month break and subsequently changed its image for their next album. An expanded version of Between the Lines was released by Cherry Pop Records in April 2012."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Black Magic is a soul album released by Martha Reeves and the Vandellas on the Gordy (Motown) label in 1972. It is the last studio album issued by the group after ten years with the label. The album is significant for featuring the group's biggest hit of the decade with the Jackson 5-esque \"Bless You\". The track returned the Vandellas to chart success briefly in the US reaching number fifty-three pop, number twenty-nine R&B and reaching number thirty-three on the UK pop singles chart. It was also a top twenty hit in Canada reaching number sixteen on the chart, and a top ten single in Puerto Rico, where it reached the number two position. Two other subsequent singles, \"In And Out of My Life\" and \"Tear It On Down\", were the trio's last Billboard charted hits reaching the top 40 on the R&B charts. After this album, the trio later disbanded that December ending the group's ten-year tenure together. Martha Reeves recalls many of the tracks on the album were originally assigned to Diana Ross before being reassigned to the group."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Blur: The Best Of is a greatest hits compilation album by English Britpop band Blur, first released in late 2000 and is the final Blur album by Food Records. It was released on CD, cassette tape, MiniDisc, double 12\" vinyl record, DVD and VHS. The CD album includes 17 of Blur's 23 singles from 1990 to 2000, plus non-single, \"This Is a Low\". A special edition of the CD version included a live CD. The DVD/VHS version contains the videos of Blur's first 22 singles. The album, which has had enduring sales, hit number 3 in the band's native UK in the autumn of 2000, while denting the US charts at number 186. The cover is by artist Julian Opie. The painting of this Blur album can be found at the National Portrait Gallery in London, England. The album's cover bears some similarity to that of Queen's 1982 Hot Space. The album received a positive critical response. Of the reviews collected from notable publications by popular review aggregator website Metacritic, the album holds an overall approval rating of 88%. On the chart ending 7 March 2009, it was reported by Music Week that the album passed over one million unit sales in the United Kingdom. A proposed title for the album was Best Blur Album in the World Ever, in reference to the compilation album series The Best... Album in the World...Ever! (which often contained songs by Blur)."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Blur is the eponymous fifth studio album by the English rock band Blur, released on 10 February 1997 by Food Records. Blur had previously been broadly critical of American popular culture and their previous albums had become associated with the Britpop movement, particularly Parklife (1994), which had helped them become one of Britain's leading pop acts. After their previous album, The Great Escape, the band faced media backlash and relationships between the members became strained. Under the suggestion of the band's guitarist, Graham Coxon, the band underwent a stylistic change, becoming influenced by American indie rock bands such as Pavement and Sonic Youth. Recording took place in London as well as in Reykjav\u00EDk, Iceland. Drummer Dave Rowntree described the music on the album as being more aggressive and emotional than their previous work. Producer Stephen Street claimed that lead singer-songwriter Damon Albarn had started writing about more personal experiences while Coxon revealed that listening to his lyrics it was clear to him that \"he'd obviously gone off his head a bit more\". Despite worries from Blur's label, EMI, and the music press that the change in style would alienate the band's predominantly teenage fanbase and that the album would flop as a result, Blur, as well as lead single, \"Beetlebum\", reached the top of the UK charts and the album was certified platinum. The album also reached the top 20 in six other countries. The success of \"Song 2\" led to Blur becoming the band's most successful album in the US where the Britpop scene had been largely unsuccessful. The album received positive and mixed reviews from most music critics, many praising the stylistic change as well as Albarn's improved songwriting."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Bonfire is a five-disc box set by Australian band AC/DC, released in 1997, and remastered with a release in Digipak format in 2003. It was created as a tribute to the band's earlier singer Bon Scott and included the two disc soundtrack to the movie Let There Be Rock, some early unreleased tracks, a live recording from the Atlantic Records studio in New York and a remastered version of Back in Black. The album was originally released in 1997 with the CDs all packaged individually in jewel cases, complete with full artwork. The original issue also features a poster, a backstage pass, keyring and a few other extras depending on the region. When the album was reissued in 2003 it was packaged in a large digipak, similar to a longbox, which featured either four- or five-disc trays. The four-tray versions contained the remastered Back in Black in its own case with booklet. All versions of the box feature a large book full of liner notes and rare pictures of the band, mostly from before Scott's death. The boxset was the subject of a bit of derision from AC/DC fans for its limited content - two live albums (one previously released) and a select few rarities, as well as the Bon-inspired Back in Black, which of course does not feature Scott on vocals. AC/DC defended the release, stating that there was very little recorded by Scott that wasn't released."@en .

It was voted one of the best albums of 1988 by NME, and as part of its acclaim, garnered the nickname \"Pet Sounds '88\" among some critics. The album has since been reissued on several formats with bonus tracks, and cited by some as a standout in Wilson's solo oeuvre. Working with an array of collaborators including his therapist Eugene Landy, Wilson accordingly themed the album around love and spirituality exemplified by its lead single \"Love and Mercy\". Although the album's sessions were contentious, where some participants demanded a progressive artistic statement versus conventional pop songs, nearly a quarter of the LP is devoted to \"Rio Grande\", a piece which was intended to rekindle Wilson's experimental drive from the mid 1960s and early 1970s. Two follow-ups to the album were planned, but ultimately scrapped: Sweet Insanity (1991), co-produced with Landy, and an unfinished 1990s album, co-produced with Andy Paley. Wilson would not release a second solo album of new original material until Imagination (1998)."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Circle is the name of a stand-up tour by the comedian Eddie Izzard in 2000. It was released on VHS and DVD in the United Kingdom on 18 November 2002. The video includes Eddie performing a French version of his show with English subtitles. The performance features many of Izzard's traditional themes, particularly religion (or \"philosophies with some good ideas, and some fucking weird ones\"). A discussion about Jesus' role in the three main Abrahamic faiths sees him \"waiting offstage\" in Judaism and playing on the same sporting team as Muhammad in Islam. This is counterpointed with a dialogue between a Crusader and his enemy in which both men are trying to kill the other \"in the name of Jesus\". He also mentions his impression that in Buddhism, Jesus is \"Buddha's baby brother Benny\". The rigidity of religion is also lampooned, particularly as it relates to the Renaissance. Galileo's persecution by the Catholic Church is mentioned, although the man is eventually asked (in prison) \"Galileo, Galileo, will you do the fandango?\" Several concepts featured in \"Circle\" have become well known among Izzard fans. Among these is a discussion of the Pope, specifically the names chosen by new popes, with the idea being that Popes John and John Paul will eventually be followed by Pope John Paul George and Ringo. A subsequent sequence talks about the renaming of a wartime pope as \"Pope Gutless Bastard I\" due to his refusal to condemn Adolf Hitler. Another famous dialogue involves another appearance of \"God and Jesus\" (where God is represented by a James Mason impression). Among other issues, this dialogue involves God questioning the wisdom of Jesus being born on Christmas Day and dying at Easter, as well as involving \"cannibalism\" and \"vampirism\" in the new religion. The sequence culminates in suggestions of what else could have been used at the Last Supper, most notably \"take these oysters, for they are my kneecaps\". Perhaps the most famous part of the routine, however, is Izzard's \"Death Star Canteen\", derived from Izzard's observation that there had to be some sort of source of food (such as a cafeteria) on the Death Star in the Star Wars movies. This observation results in an extended dialogue in which Darth Vader is attempting to order \"Penne all'arrabbiata\" for lunch, only to be forced to get a tray (which is wet) and later be forced to admit that he is \"Jeff Vader\" in order to get respect."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Deliverance is the second album by American rapper Bubba Sparxxx, released on September 16, 2003 by Beat Club/Interscope Records. It was produced by Timbaland and Organized Noize. The album debuted at #10 on the Billboard 200 with 64,500 copies sold in the first week released. Although this album was only moderately successful, selling around 350,000 copies, it is regarded by many critics such as The Source, Hip Hop Connection and more mainstream magazines such as Q to be something of a landmark in hip-hop music. The album's main strength according to critics was that it embraced Sparxxx's grass roots, with production heavily influenced by country music and similar musical styles. This influence is evident on tracks such as \"Comin' Round\" which sampled its chorus from a track by the bluegrass group The Yonder Mountain String Band, leadout single \"Jimmy Mathis\" which is led by a catchy harmonica tune from the Area Code 615 track \"Stone Fox Chase\", and \"She Tried\" led by a washboard rhythm section and a mellow fiddle sound. Deliverance spawned two hit singles, \"Back In The Mud\" and \"Deliverance\". In 2010, Rhapsody included it in its list of \"The 10 Best Albums By White Rappers\".[citation needed] \"Back In The Mud\" was also featured on the Madden 2004 soundtrack."@en ;

On the record, Carey worked with a variety of producers and writers, including Walter Afanasieff, the only hold over from her previous effort. Additionally, Carey wrote and produced the album's material with Robert Clivill\u00E9s and David Cole from C+C Music Factory and Carole King, with whom she wrote one song. Upon release, Emotions received generally mixed reviews from contemporary music critics. The album debuted at number four on the Billboard 200, surprising many critics following the success of Carey's debut, which spent eleven weeks atop the chart. While selling far less than Mariah Carey, Emotions was eventually certified quadruple-platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), denoting shipments of four million copies throughout the country, with estimated sales standing at 3,595,000 copies. Emotions achieved moderate success outside the United States, peaking within the top ten in Australia, Canada, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway and the United Kingdom. Its success in Japan was strong, shipping one million copies there. The album has sold 8 million copies worldwide. Three commercial singles were released from the album. The title track, the album's lead song, became Carey's fifth chart topper on the Billboard Hot 100, making her the only artist in history to have their first five singles reach the chart's summit. Additionally, it became Carey's third chart topper in Canada, and reached the top ten in France, the Netherlands and New Zealand. \"Can't Let Go\" was released as the second single from Emotions on October 23, 1991. Due to Columbia's removal of the single from stores in an attempt to boost the album's sales, \"Can't Let Go\" failed to become her sixth chart topper in the US, peaking at number two. European and worldwide success was very limited, reaching the top 20 in only Canada and the UK. Similarly, \"Make It Happen\" peaked at number five in the US, and achieved relatively weak international charting, prompting Columbia to halt promotion of the album."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Femme Fatale is the seventh studio album by American recording artist Britney Spears. It was released on March 25, 2011, by JIVE Records. Spears wanted to make a \"fresh-sounding\" and \"fierce dance album\", incorporating dance-pop and electropop styles with elements of dubstep, techno, and trance. She began working on the album during the second leg of The Circus Starring Britney Spears (2009), while also working on her second compilation album The Singles Collection (2009). Contributions to its production came from a variety of producers and songwriters, including long-time collaborator Max Martin in addition to Dr. Luke, William Orbit, Fraser T Smith, Rodney Jerkins, Bloodshy & Avant. will.i.am, and StarGate. Upon its release, Femme Fatale received generally favorable reviews from music critics, who complimented its production and dance-pop style, but noted Spears' supposed lack of involvement and heavily processed vocals. She received zero songwriting credits on the album, which had not been done by her since her earlier years. Some stated that Spears was no longer the center of the album and found a trade-off to be real personality. Ryan Tedder however, defended her, saying that Frank Sinatra and Garth Brooks were huge artists who didn't write most of their songs. The album debuted atop of the charts in Australia, Brazil, Canada, Mexico, Russia, South Korea and the United States, and peaking inside the top ten in twenty-four countries. In the United States, she earned her sixth number one album. Four singles were released from the album. It became Spears's first album to have three top 10 singles on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100, with \"Hold It Against Me\", \"Till the World Ends\", and \"I Wanna Go\" peaking at numbers one, three, and seven, respectively. The fourth and final single \"Criminal\" peaked at number one in Brazil and in the top twenty in five countries. Spears promoted the album with television performances, the Femme Fatale Tour, and collaborations with Kesha, Nicki Minaj, Travis Barker, and Rihanna."@en ;

Three tracks had never been released. \"My Girl\", \"Ride On, Baby\" and \"Sittin' on a Fence\", the first of which was recorded in May 1965 during the sessions for Satisfaction, and the other two of which were recorded in December 1965 during the first lot of Aftermath sessions. The title refers to the album's cover, with flower stems underneath the portrait of each band member. Bassist Bill Wyman claims that Mick Jagger and Keith Richards deliberately arranged the stem of Brian Jones's flower so that it had no leaves, as a prank.[citation needed]The portraits are from the British version of Aftermath.

Two tracks, \"I Didn't Know I Loved You ('Til I Saw You Rock 'n' Roll)\" and \"Rock And Roll\", the latter a song in two parts, achieved success as singles; each spent time amongst the top 40 singles in both the US and UK. The album featured, in addition to including the two singles, other original songs that generated fan support, including \"Rock On!\", \"Shakey Sue\" and \"The Famous Instigator\", as well as Glitter's versions of \"Baby, Please Don't Go\" (written and first performed by American Big Joe Williams) and \"The Wanderer\" (first recorded by Dion DiMucci & the Del-Satins). The disc was a best-seller, reaching a high of # 8 in the UK charts. The album was the first by Glitter to achieve international success and presaged his 1973 Touch Me. The album was also reissued in 1996 as a picture disc that was limited to 5,000 copies, which had a slightly differing track list than the album (included four added tracks: \"I'm the Leader of the Gang (I Am)\", \"It's Not a Lot\", \"Just Fancy That\" and \"Thank You Baby for Myself\"."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Glitter is the soundtrack album from the film of the same name, and the eighth studio album by American singer Mariah Carey. It was released on September 11, 2001, by Virgin Records America. The album was a complete musical departure from any of Carey's previous releases, focusing heavily on recreating a 1980s disco era to accompany the film, set in 1983. By covering or heavily sampling several older tunes and songs, Carey created Glitter as an album that would help viewers connect with the film, as well as incorporating newly written ballads. The singer collaborated with Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis and DJ Clue, who co-produced the album. Musically, Glitter was structured to be a retro-influenced album and have more of a dance-oriented element. On several songs, critics noted Carey to be more sexually suggestive lyrically than before, in part due to the inclusion of several guest hip hop musicians. Glitter featured several other musical acts such as Eric Ben\u00E9t, Ludacris, Busta Rhymes, Fabolous, and Ja Rule. Both the album and its accompanying film were met with generally negative reviews from music critics who felt the album failed in trying to capture a genuine 1980s theme, and there were too many guest appearances. Universally, Glitter was viewed as a commercial and critical failure, leading to Virgin Records cancelling Carey's $100 million five-album contract and dropping her from the label. While it debuted at number seven on the US Billboard 200, it was Carey's lowest-first week sales of any album she had ever released. Internationally, it peaked outside the top-ten in many countries, but topped the charts in Japan. Glitter remains one of Carey's lowest selling albums. Several singles were released but attained weak charting positions. \"Loverboy\" served as the first single from the album and quickly became Carey's lowest charting lead single globally. As the song stalled on the American charts, Virgin dropped the price to 0.99 cents to spur sales. The reduction helped the single peak at number two on the US Billboard Hot 100. Internationally, the song failed to garner much traction. \"Never Too Far\", the album's second single, became a minor American hit, reaching number 81 on the US Hot 100. Subsequent singles failed to make much of an impact on prominent global charts, some not charting at all."@en ;

Unlike her previous album, Don't Forget (2008), Lovato did not collaborate with the Jonas Brothers, as she wanted to work with different people and give the album a personal approach. Lovato collaborated for the album with established songwriters and producers, such as E. Kidd Bogart, Gary Clark, Toby Gad, John Mayer, Jon McLaughlin, Lindy Robbins and John Fields, who produced her previous album Don't Forget. Lovato also collaborated with The Academy Is... lead singer William Beckett to write a song about a strained relationship with her father, which was originally set to appear on the album, but was later dropped. The song later appeared on her third album Unbroken (2011). Here We Go Again derives mainly from the pop rock genre, mixed with influences of power pop, jazz-pop, soul and pop. Lovato wanted the album's music to be less rock and more mellow than her previous album, while exploring more mature sounds and lyrics.[citation needed] Critical reception of the album was positive; critics praised Lovato for not relying on vocal manipulations and instead showing off her natural ability. Although some critics called the album catchy, others felt that it was predictable and at times too much alike Kelly Clarkson. Here We Go Again sold 108,000 copies during its first week of release in the United States and debuted at number one on the Billboard 200. Since its release, the album has sold over 500,000 copies in the US, and was certified Gold. Internationally, the album was a hit and peaked inside the top 40 on charts in Australia, Brazil, Canada, Greece, Mexico, New Zealand and Spain. It was certified Platinum in Brazil, and Gold in Chile. \"Here We Go Again\" was released as the lead single from the album in June 2009 and was Lovato's first solo single to reach the top 40 on the Billboard Hot 100, peaking at number 15. \"Remember December\" was the second and final single from the album in January 2010.

It was co-produced by Justin Furstenfeld and David Castell. It is the only Blue October album to feature former member Dwayne Casey on bass guitar, and the band's first album featuring lead guitarist C.B. Hudson. The track \"Come in Closer\" features guest vocals by Zayra Alvarez, who later, on the CBS reality show Rockstar: Supernova, sang the song \"Razorblade\" on her final episode before being voted off. History for Sale was voted best album in the 2003 Houston Press Music Awards. The album \u2014 re-released on Universal Records on August 5, 2003 \u2014 is largely a response to the control the label placed on the group during the Consent to Treatment production process.

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/I_Want_You_(Marvin_Gaye_album)>	rdf:type	schema:MusicAlbum ;
	dbo:abstract	"I Want You is the fourteenth studio album by American soul musician Marvin Gaye, released March 16, 1976, on Motown-subsidiary label Tamla Records. Recording sessions for the album took place throughout 1975 and 1976 at Motown Recording Studios, also known as Hitsville West, and Gaye's personal studio Marvin's Room in Los Angeles, California. The album has often been noted by critics for producer Leon Ware's exotic, low-key production and the erotic, sexual themes in his and Gaye's songwriting. The album's cover artwork adapts neo-mannerist artist Ernie Barnes's famous painting The Sugar Shack (1971). I Want You consisted of Gaye's first recorded studio material since his highly successful and well-received album Let's Get It On (1973). While it marked a change in musical direction for Gaye, departing from his trademark Motown and doo-wop-influenced sound for funky, light-disco soul, the album maintained and expanded on his previous work's sexual themes. Following a mixed response from critics at the time of its release, I Want You has earned retrospective recognition from writers and music critics as one of Gaye's most controversial works and influential to such musical styles as disco, quiet storm, R&B, and neo soul."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Indestructible is the fourth studio album by the American heavy metal band Disturbed. A self-produced effort, Indestructible is the first Disturbed album that did not feature Johnny K, the producer of Disturbed's previous three albums, The Sickness, Believe, and Ten Thousand Fists. Indestructible was recorded at Groovemaster Studios in Chicago, Illinois. The album features two songs, \"Perfect Insanity\" and \"Divide\", that were written by Disturbed prior to their first album, The Sickness, but were never previously released. Indestructible is also the third consecutive Disturbed album to debut at number-one on the Billboard 200. The album features significantly darker themes than any of Disturbed's previous work, according to the band. Some of the lyrical themes involve actual experiences that vocalist David Draiman had endured over the course of the past few years prior to making the album, including \"bad relationships\", a motorcycle accident that he was involved with, and an incident of suicide. To match the aggressive attitude and nature of said themes, Draiman told the other band members to create darker, more textural music than they have before. Despite these themes, the title track, \"Indestructible\", is meant to encourage those in the military that are fighting in wars and boost their morale. Indestructible was released on June 3, 2008 in Compact Disc format, and also as two different limited edition and special edition digipaks, debuting at number-one on the Billboard 200, making it the third consecutive number-one debut by Disturbed on that chart, which had only been achieved by five other rock bands prior to the album's release. The album also shipped over 253,000 units in its opening week. Indestructible was met with mixed reviews by critics, earning a score of 57% on review-aggregating website Metacritic, based on six reviews. The album was certified Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America in April 2009 for shipping over 1,000,000 copies in the United States. The single \"Inside the Fire\" was nominated for a 2009 Grammy Award in the \"Best Hard Rock Performance\" category."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Kala is the second studio album by English-Sri Lankan recording artist M.I.A., released on 8 August 2007 by XL Recordings. The album features musical styles including dance music and makes extensive use of South Asian music such as that of the urumee, a drum used in gaana music native to Tamil Nadu, India. It was mainly written and produced by M.I.A. and Switch, and features contributions from Timbaland, Diplo, Afrikan Boy and The Wilcannia Mob. M.I.A. named the album after her mother, in contrast to her first album Arular, which was named after her father, and stated that her mother's struggles in life are a major theme of the recording. She began recording the album in early 2006 and worked on the tracks in various locations around the world, including India, Jamaica, Australia, Liberia and Trinidad. Planned sessions in the United States failed to occur, after M.I.A. was refused a long-term work visa to enter the country. Kala was ranked as one of the best albums of the year by several publications. It reached number eighteen on the Billboard 200 chart and topped the magazine's Top Electronic Albums chart. In the United Kingdom it reached number thirty-nine on the UK Albums Chart. Kala spawned the singles \"Bird Flu\", \"Boyz\", \"Jimmy\" and \"Paper Planes\". As of 2013 the album had sold over 500,000 copies in the US."@en ;

The album contains numerous selections Zappa had previously recorded either with the Mothers of Invention or under his own name, including: In addition, the track \"Music For Electric Violin And Low Budget Orchestra\" includes the themes from \"Duke of Prunes\", from Absolutely Free, and \"Pound for a Brown\", from Uncle Meat. Zappa excised those themes, and everything that followed them, when he later recorded the piece himself under the title \"Revised Music For Guitar And Low-Budget Orchestra\", which was first released on his 1978 album Studio Tan. George Duke, who would eventually join Zappa and Ponty in the Mothers, is featured on piano on all tracks. Ernie Watts is featured on alto and tenor saxophone on all tracks except for \"Music for Violin and Low Budget Orchestra\".

The album combines pieces written by classical and modern composers.The classical pieces are \"How Fair This Place\" (\"\u0417\u0434\u0435\u0441\u044C \u0445\u043E\u0440\u043E\u0448\u043E\") by Rachmaninov; \"Figlio Perduto\", which is based on Ludwig van Beethoven's Symphony No. 7 Op. 92, 2nd movement in A minor \"Allegretto\"; Solo Con Te (Handel - Dank Sei Dir, Herr); Aria \"La Luna\" from Opera Rusalka. With La Luna, Brightman combined elements of her traditional operatic background with her newer style of pop music. \"Hijo de la Luna\" (translating to \"Son of the Moon\" in Spanish) is a cover originally performed by the Spanish synthpop band Mecano. Written by Ennio Morricone, \"La Califfa\" is the title track of the 1970 Italian film with the same name. The underlying concept of the album is the moon. It is the 17th top-selling classical album of the 2000s in the US, according to Nielsen SoundScan, and is Brightman's second highest seller in the country after her 1997 release Timeless/Time to Say Goodbye. Aside from the US, the album experienced its strongest sales in Asia, where it received a quintuple platinum certification in Taiwan, earned Brightman's first Gold award in Japan and currently remains as the best-selling classical album of all-time in China by a non-Asian artist. It was certified Diamond by the Chinese Administration of Radio, Film, and Television."@en ;

McCoy announced his plans to pursue a solo career in early 2010, although he insisted that Gym Class Heroes had not broken up. After creating demos of melancholy and low-tempo songs, McCoy decided to abandon his early material and start over, as he claimed the songs were \"too personal\". He began to write more uptempo \"party anthems\" with lyrical themes of overcoming grief. Musically, McCoy draws from various influences on the record, including hip-hop, reggae, and rock. The album contains collaborations from Bruno Mars, Cee Lo Green, and T-Pain, among others. Upon its release, Lazarus debuted at number 25 on the U.S. Billboard 200 chart with sales of 15,000 copies. The lead single from the album was \"Billionaire\", which peaked at number four on the Billboard Hot 100. The songs \"Need You\" and \"We'll Be Alright\" have also been released as singles. Critical response to the album has been mixed to positive, with most critics praising the album's upbeat songs yet criticizing the overabundance of featured collaborations. Gregory Heaney of Allmusic opined that \"Even though every track on the album isn\u2019t a keeper, it has some solid additions to any summer playlist and will definitely please fans of Gym Class Heroes.\" The album has sold more than 74,000 copies as of April 2012."@en ;

It includes four covers, \"A la Orilla del Mar\" (\"At the Seaside\"), \"La Vie en Rose\" (\"Life in Pink\"), \"Cien A\u00F1os\" (\"A Hundred Years\") and \"Nunca Sabr\u00E1s\" (\"You'll Never Know\"). The album was certified Platinum + Gold in Mexico for 350,000 sold. To celebrate Thal\u00EDa's 25 anniversary as a solo artist, as for December 2014, this album is available in the digital platforms iTunes and Spotify."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Love is the second album by English rock band The Cult, released in 1985 on Beggars Banquet Records. The record has been released in nearly 30 countries worldwide, and sold an estimated 2.5 million copies. It gave The Cult commercial success in the UK and abroad. Love was recorded at Jacob's Studios in Farnham, Surrey, in July and August 1985. Many European CD pressings, as well as Canadian and Australian pressings, include two bonus tracks: \"Little Face\" as track four, and \"Judith\" as track eleven. Various other foreign pressings have several other bonus tracks. For unknown reasons, the Korean vinyl and cassette tape editions omitted the songs \"Big Neon Glitter\" and \"Revolution\". Also inexplicably, in the Philippines a considerably shorter version of the song \"Brother Wolf, Sister Moon\" was used; it lasts only 5:18, omitting most of the guitar solos in the second half of the song. In 2000, the album was remastered and reissued on CD, with only the ten original songs and different artwork. \"Big Neon Glitter\" and \"Hollow Man\" are alternately listed with and without the article \"The\" in their title, respectively. In 2003, the record was issued on CD in Russia, Belarus and Lithuania, formerly being available only as a bootleg LP in the Soviet Union. These 2003 Eastern European releases came with the bonus tracks \"Faith Healer\" and \"Edie (Ciao Baby)\" (acoustic) as tracks 13 and 14, and the word acoustic is misspelled as \"accoustic\"; the pressings also use a different font for the lettering. There is also an Indonesian cassette tape version which rearranges the track listing, and includes \"Dreamtime\" and \"Bad Medicine Waltz\", from the previous Cult record Dreamtime. To coincide with the band's Love Live Tour in August 2009, the band released two different editions of the album: Version one is the \"Expanded Edition\", a 2-CD set consisting of the album on one disc as well as extended versions of album cuts, remixes, and b-sides on the second disc. This set was released on August 18, 2009 in the USA/Canada and September 21 in Europe. Version two is called the \"Omnibus Edition\" which features the first two discs from the \"Expanded Edition\" plus two more discs. Disc three features extremely rare demos from the Love album presented for the first time, and disc four features a live concert recorded by the BBC at the Hammersmith Odeon in London on October 31, 1985."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Machine Gun is the debut studio album by The Commodores, released on July 22, 1974, on Motown Records. Unlike subsequent Commodores albums, Machine Gun has only funk music and is devoid of slow-paced ballads. The titular lead song has Milan Williams on clavinet, which led the Motown executive Berry Gordy to name the song \"Machine Gun\" as the clavinet work reminded him of gunfire.[citation needed] This track peaked at #7 on the R&B charts, while reaching #22 on the overall pop charts. Samples from the song were used prominently by the Beastie Boys in their 1989 song \"Hey Ladies,\" and the song itself was featured on the soundtrack for the 1997 film Boogie Nights. In the early 1980s the tune was also used as the opening theme of the New Zealand music show Ready to Roll. The second single to be released, \"I Feel Sanctified\", reached #12 on the R&B charts, and concerns a man spiritually blessed by his girlfriend's love. The song has Ronald LaPread on bass guitar, while Lionel Richie and William King contributed horn arrangements. The tune has an a capella introduction with three-way harmonization. \"The Bump\" became a radio and dancehall staple, with Richie and Walter Orange on vocals calling to female listeners to \"...do the bump, do the bump, baby!\" \"The Assembly Line\" and \"The Zoo (The Human Zoo)\" are both socially charged songs concerning the challenges faced by those who try to make a difference in society. \"The Zoo\" has an introduction with Williams playing a melody which resembles circus music. The remaining songs are also funk tunes. On \"Superman\", Richie sings from the point of view of the superhero himself. In 1989, Australian pop singer Kate Ceberano covered \"Young Girls are My Weakness\", re-written from a female perspective as \"Young Boys are My Weakness\", on her album Brave."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Mesopotamia is an album by new wave band The B-52s. It was produced by David Byrne of Talking Heads and was the band's third studio album. Due to conflicts with Byrne and record label pressure, recording sessions were aborted prematurely and only six of ten songs to be completed were released as a shorter than originally intended LP. The record was distributed as a 12\" LP by Warner Bros. in the US and by Island Records on both CD and vinyl in the UK and other non-US markets. The original Island Records vinyl release in the UK contained different mixes of all the songs, three of which (\"Loveland,\" \"Cake\" and \"Throw That Beat in the Garbage Can\") were drastically different and substantially longer than the American release. This was an error, and the discs were quickly recalled and reissued with the correct versions of \"Cake\" and \"Garbage Can\" reinstated. However, the extended \"Loveland\" remained. The Island CD release was the same as the American LP as per the band's request. However, the 1991 US release of the CD (paired with Party Mix!), included a newly remixed version of Mesopotamia that is different from the original US LP. Mesopotamia is considered a departure in style for The B-52s; Byrne and the band added a large amount of additional instruments, vocal overdubs, horns, synthesizers, layered percussion and an altogether richer sound. A larger emphasis was placed on production after the raw sound of their debut album The B-52s and the slightly more polished sound of their second album, Wild Planet."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Music Box is the third studio album by American singer Mariah Carey. It was released by Columbia Records on August 31, 1993, in North America. The album comprises ballads primarily co-written by Carey and Walter Afanasieff, with whom she had previously worked on Emotions (1991), and a few urban dance tracks. During the course of the album's development, Carey wanted to broaden her audience, choosing a more pop/R&B oriented sound. During this time frame, they experimented with different organs and other musical instruments, leading the album's sound away from her more contemporary previous efforts. Two unused tracks from the album sessions were released as B-sides: \"Do You Think of Me\" and \"Everything Fades Away\". In order to successfully take the album in a new direction, Carey and Afanasieff sought out new and innovative producers, as well as some from Carey's previous releases. Kenneth \"Babyface\" Edmonds first began working with Carey on Music Box, where he helped produce some of the album's softer and more melodious tracks, as well as being part of the songwriting process. Additional writers and producers were Robert Clivill\u00E9s and David Cole (a pair also known as C+C Music Factory) and Daryl Simmons. While the album featured a range of different talented music producers, the bulk of the songwriting was done by Carey and her writing partner, Walter Afanasieff. In future projects, they would continue writing material for Carey's albums, until her 1999 release Rainbow, where he is absent from the writing credits. Four singles were released from the album. The first three, \"Dreamlover\", \"Hero\" and \"Without You\", became worldwide chart-topping singles, the latter becoming Carey's highest charting international single of her career. \"Without You\" became Carey's first number-one single in most European markets and reached the top three in the United States. To promote Music Box, Carey embarked on the short but successful Music Box Tour which traveled to select cities in North America. Carey was nominated for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance for \"Dreamlover\" at the 1994 Grammy Awards and received the same nomination for \"Hero\" at the 1995 Grammy Awards. After its release, Music Box received generally mixed reviews from music critics. The album faced criticism regarding Carey's more mellow and lazy tone in comparison to her previous work. Despite some unfavorable reviews, the album became a commercial success, topping the Billboard 200 and becoming Carey's first number-one album in Australia, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. The Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) certified it diamond, for shipments of ten million copies across the United States. Music Box remains Carey's highest seller with 32 million copies sold worldwide and is one of the best-selling albums of all time."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Musique is the fourth studio album by the Norwegian metal band Theatre of Tragedy, released in 2000. The title on the album's cover, [\u02C8mju\u02D0z\u026Ak], is the pronunciation of the English word \"music\" transcribed in the International Phonetic Alphabet. Musique is the album that marked for the band the change from gothic metal with Early Modern English lyrics to a more electronic style, using Modern English. The change in musical direction for Theatre of Tragedy was associated with a change from traditional gothic and supernatural themes to lyrics based on modern life, including technology (\"Machine\", \"Radio\"), nightlife (\"Image\", \"The New Man\") and streetfighting (\"Crash/Concrete\"). The song \"Commute\" has the line \"It's more fun to commute\" in its lyrics, possibly a reference to Kraftwerk's \"It's more fun to compute\" from their Computer World album, which in turn is a reference to \"It's more fun to compete\" found on old pinball machines. Metal Mind Productions reissued the album after it had been digitally remastered using a 24-bit process on a golden disc. It includes three bonus tracks, \"Quirk\" (Original Version) - also known as the original version of \"Image\" - , \"Radio\" (Unreleased Mix) and \"Reverie\" (Unreleased Mix).

	dbo:abstract	"My Story is the sixth studio album by Japanese singer-songwriter Ayumi Hamasaki, released on December 15, 2004 by Avex Trax. The album's lyrics were written in their entirety by Hamasaki herself, with composition on the album handled by a team of composers including Kazuhito Kikuchi, Bounceback, Tetsuya Yukumi, and, on some songs, Hamasaki, under the pen name Crea. By the end of her 2004 arena tour, Hamasaki became dissatisfied with her position at Avex. She felt that the company was treating her as a product rather than a human being and artist. After her two previous efforts, I Am... and Rainbow, which she felt had been rushed, Hamasaki decided that on her next record she would not write to \"give people hope\" or write \"something good\"; instead, she simply wrote \"freely and honestly\" with no set theme. These writing sessions resulted in autobiographical lyrics, exploring Hamasaki's own emotions and reminisces about her career. The music of My Story reflects the free theme of the lyrics; its noticeable rock overtones expressed Hamasaki's liking for rock music. Pleased with its sound, Hamasaki declared that My Story was the first album of her career with which she felt truly satisfied. Lead single \"Moments\" was released on March 31, 2004 to positive reviews from critics, who praised its rock influences. It was a commercial success too, debuting at number one, selling over 300,000 copies, and receiving a platinum certification. The second single, \"Inspire\", was successful as well, reaching number one and being certified platinum; it sold over 329,000 units, becoming the highest-selling single from My Story. Similarly, \"Carols\" topped the charts in Japan and was certified Platinum. My Story was positively received by critics, who appreciated its aggressive style compared to Western pop music at the time, and its alternative sound. A commercial success, it became Hamasaki's sixth consecutive number-one album in Japan, debuting at the top spot with first week sales of 574,321 copies. In its 43-week chart run, My Story sold 1,132,444 copies and became the seventh best-selling album of the year in Japan. Combined with the sales of its three singles, My Story sold 2,073,640 copies and is the 222nd best-selling album in Japan of all time."@en ;

It was recorded at Record Plant Studios in California and remastered in 2007 at Sterling Sound Studios in New York. \"Nada Personal\" provided the band with at least three successful singles, which became the breakout songs for the band all over Ibero-America. The album showed Soda Stereo in a new musical direction focused mainly on the British New Wave style. The most successful singles from the album were \"Juegos De Seducci\u00F3n\" (Games of Seduction/Seduction Games), \"Nada Personal\" (Nothing Personal) and \"Cuando pase el temblor\" (When the Earthquake Ends). Those songs enjoyed strong airplay during 1985 and 1986, primarily in Argentina, Mexico, Uruguay and Chile. Such successful songs were performed live twice at the Vi\u00F1a del Mar International Song Festival held in Chile in February, 1987. Many people (including music journalists) consider these two shows very historic."@en ;

The album was executive produced by Giles Martin, with production by Martin, Mark Ronson, Ethan Johns and Paul Epworth and it was mastered by Ted Jensen at Sterling Sound, New York. McCartney has stated that New was inspired by recent events in his life as well as memories of his pre-Beatles history. He added that some of the arrangements are unlike his usual rock recordings, and that he specifically sought out younger producers to work with. He and his stage band performed in various venues to promote the album, along with promotional events held through social media. The first single, \"New\", and the album were met with a generally favourable reception from music critics. The album peaked at number 3 on the UK Albums Chart and on the US Billboard 200."@en ;

The original pressings of the album contained samplings from several films including The Outsiders (1983), Weird Science (1985), and That Thing You Do! (1996), as well as Robert Frost's poem \"Nothing Gold Can Stay\", after which the album is named. On the strength of the release, Richard Reines, co-founder of Drive-Thru Records, signed the band after paying Eulogy a $5,000 license fee in order to re-release the album. Propelled by debut single \"Hit or Miss\", Nothing Gold Can Stay garnered a cult following and sold in excess of 300,000 copies.

It was ranked 90th in a 2005 survey held by British television's Channel 4 to determine the 100 greatest albums of all time. The album peaked at number two and remained in the UK Albums Chart for over a year. It was the first album produced by the team of Clive Langer and Alan Winstanley, who would go on to work with artists such as Elvis Costello and the Attractions, Morrissey, Dexys Midnight Runners and They Might Be Giants, as well as producing all but one of Madness' subsequent albums. The album was recorded in 10 days. The cover photograph was based on the back cover of a Kilburn and the High Roads album. The title track, released as a single, was originally written and recorded by the Jamaican ska musician Prince Buster. The spoken line, \"Don't watch that, watch this...\" in the introduction is from another Prince Buster song, \"The Scorcher\". It was their second single (after \"The Prince\") which was a tribute song to this musician. The song heard between the two last titles on the album's original track list is \"Madness\", a cover of the Prince Buster song. While it is not listed on the UK LP sleeve or label, it was appended to the US Sire LP release and later releases on CD. This recording is different from the version found as the B-side of the \"The Prince\" single."@en ;

dbr:Sad_Wings_of_Destiny	rdf:type	schema:MusicAlbum ;
	dbo:abstract	"Sad Wings of Destiny is the second album by the English heavy metal group Judas Priest, released in 1976. It is considered the album on which Judas Priest consolidated their sound and image, and songs from it such as \"Victim of Changes\" and \"The Ripper\" have since become live standards. It is the only album to feature drummer Alan Moore. Noted for its riff-driven heavy metal sound and the wide range of Rob Halford's vocals, the album displays a wide variety of styles, moods, and textures, inspired by an array of groups such as Queen, Deep Purple, and Black Sabbath. The centrepiece \"Victim of Changes\" is an eight-minute track featuring heavy riffing trading off with high-pitched vocals, extended guitar leads, and a slow, moody breakdown toward the end. \"Tyrant\" and \"The Ripper\" are short, dense, high-powered rockers with many parts and changes. Riffs and solos dominate \"Genocide\", \"Island of Domination\", and \"Deceiver\", and the band finds more laid-back moments in the crooning piano-backed \"Epitaph\" and the moody \"Dreamer Deceiver\". Sad Wings of Destiny had a positive reception but weak sales as it was released just as punk rock was dominating the spotlight in the UK. The band recorded their first two albums with the independent Gull label under tight budgets; after living off a single meal per day while working side jobs to support themselves, the group grew frustrated with the financial situation and signed with CBS Records for their next album, Sin After Sin (1977). Breaking their contract resulted in the rights to Sad Wings of Destiny and its demo recordings falling into Gull's hands."@en ;

Co-produced by Craig Street, it marked another shift in direction for Henry's music, and a foray into the genres of jazz and soul music. The opening track is a homage to comedian Richard Pryor (whom the album is also dedicated to), and according to Henry's essay \"The Ghost in the Song,\" he was \"called by a vision\" to collaborate with free jazz artist Ornette Coleman. Henry wrote: Henry eventually convinced Coleman to record a solo for the track \"Richard Pryor Addresses a Tearful Nation,\" and also contributed a reprise at the very end of the album as a hidden track. Another track of note is \"Stop\", a tango originally written by Henry. His wife, Melanie, sent an early demo of the track to her sister Madonna, who re-used the lyrics for Don't Tell Me. Henry often quips during live gigs that \"I recorded my version as a tango, and she recorded hers as a hit\". Apart from the lyrics, the two songs have nothing in common. Lizz Wright recorded a jazzy take on \"Stop\" which she included in her 2005 release Dreaming Wide Awake, also an album produced by Craig Street and recorded by S. Husky H\u00F6skulds."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Sentimental Journey is the debut studio album by former Beatles drummer Ringo Starr, released in 1970, as the band was splintering apart. Although Starr was the third member of the group to issue solo work (after George Harrison and John Lennon), Sentimental Journey is notable for being the first non-avant-garde studio album by a member of the band, in light of the experimental, soundtrack or live releases his aforementioned bandmates had already released. Paul McCartney's debut, McCartney, would follow three weeks after Sentimental Journey's release. Recording of the album was completed in early March 1970, with Sentimental Journey being rushed out a few weeks later to avoid clashing in the shops with the Beatles' impending final album Let It Be in May."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Take Care is the second studio album by Canadian recording artist Drake; it was released on November 15, 2011, by Aspire Music Group, Young Money Entertainment, Cash Money Records and Republic Records. The album serves as a follow-up to his debut album Thank Me Later (2010). Production for the album took place during 2010 to 2011 and it was handled by Noah \"40\" Shebib, Boi-1da, T-Minus, Just Blaze, The Weeknd and Jamie xx, among others. Drake sought as he began to record a more cohesive recording than his debut album, which he felt was rushed throughout this whole development. While expanding on the sonic aesthetic of his debut album, Take Care features an atmospheric sound that is characterized by low-key musical elements and incorporates R&B, pop, electronica, and post-dubstep styles. Drake's lyrics mostly eschew boastful raps for introspective lyrics that deal with topics such as failed romances, relationship with friends and family, growing wealth and fame, concerns about leading a hollow life, and despondency. The album has been noted by music writers for its minimalist R&B elements, existential subject matter, conflicted lyrics, and Drake's alternately sung and rapped vocals. Becoming one of the most anticipated music releases in 2011, Take Care experienced several delays to its release date and subsequently leaked to the Internet nine days before its scheduled release. The album was promoted with eight singles\u2014 \"Marvins Room\", \"Headlines\", \"Make Me Proud\", \"The Motto\", \"Take Care\", \"HYFR (Hell Ya Fucking Right)\", \"Crew Love\", and \"Lord Knows\"\u2014all of which attained chart success, and Drake's Club Paradise Tour in 2012.

The band's common theme for the album was a 'back to their roots' approach, with vocalist Maxi Jazz elaborating that the album was a return to the old, with an eye on the future; \"This is probably the danciest album we\u2019ve ever created; it's like a return to what we did before but more so.\" Sister Bliss added that the club culture was something the band members, especially her, were stuck with; \"Late-night DJing will be the death of me but I\u2019m good at it, goddammit. I\u2019ve always found house music deeply absorbing; it forces you to be in the moment and it's locked into my DNA. I get riled when dance music gets undervalued as mindless nonsense because there's a galvanising force in people getting together to do something positive. There's nothing more joyous than people dancing and losing themselves to music.\" \"What\u2019s exciting is putting The Dance into context as our sixth album,\" adds Bliss. \"After getting together to do one single, we never thought we\u2019d reach this point. It's mad, innit? But it's also very rare that you find a unique voice and when Rollo and me first encountered Maxi, we didn't want the conversation to end. Our first record, Salva Mea, was very odd for 1990s dance music. The original is like a symphony that goes into hip hop then banging house \u2013 it's all over the bloody shop.\" The album was commercially successful and has sold over 600,000 units worldwide."@en ;

This re-issue includes a bonus CD featuring nine re-worked recordings of tracks (or segments of tracks) found on the original album with different singers and all acoustic instrumentation. The Final Experiment introduces several concepts which appear in future Ayreon albums, such as humanity's propensity for war (\"Waracle\"), polluting earth's environment (\"Listen to the Waves\"), or the gratuitous use of technology and computers in human society (\"Computer-Reign (Game Over)\").

The album was recorded with producer Steve Evetts at his own studio The Omen Room Studios in California. The album has been noted as distinct from the band's other work, featuring a less aggressive and more melodic sound. The album was supported by three singles release, which all received daytime radio play on BBC Radio 1, and upon its release, debuted at ample levels on the British and United States charts. The album was supported by very brief levels of tour support, by the end of 2011 they released a new single, Devil's Island, which stylistically sounded drastically different from The Here and Now. The band stopped supporting The Here and Now to record their fifth Daybreaker for a 2012 release."@en ;

In addition to being Springsteen's first studio album in seven years, it was also his first with the E Street Band in 18 years.

Upon its release, The Rising was a critical and commercial success, and hailed as the triumphant return for Springsteen. It debuted at #1 on the Billboard 200 chart, with first-week sales of over 520,000 copies. With this, Springsteen became the oldest person to achieve a first-week sales of over a half of a million copies in the United States.[citation needed] The album also garnered a Grammy Award for Best Rock Album in 2003; although nominated for the Album of the Year award as well, it was beaten by Norah Jones' debut album Come Away with Me.

	dbo:abstract	"The Rutles Archaeology is an album by the comedy band The Rutles. Like their previous release, the album contains pastiches of Beatles songs. Three of the four musicians who had created the soundtrack for the 1978 film \u2013 Neil Innes, John Halsey, and Ricky Fataar \u2013 reunited in 1996 and recorded a second album, Archaeology, an affectionate send-up of The Beatles Anthology albums (although its original cover design rather parodied that of The Beatles' singles compilation Past Masters: Volume One). The fourth 'real' Rutle, Ollie Halsall, died in Spain in 1992. Eric Idle was invited to participate, but declined. Like the Anthology project that it lampooned, it featured tracks ostensibly from all periods of the Rutles' career, sequenced to reflect the fictional band's chronology. Several of the songs were actually older Innes songs that were dusted off and given the 'Rutles' treatment. The reunion was blessed by George Harrison, who encouraged The Pre-Fab Four to proceed. (When approached, he told Innes, 'Sure. It's all part of the \"soup\"...', an encounter that Innes related in interviews in 1996.) The reunion was triggered by Innes's appearance at the Los Angeles festival \"Monty Python: Lust For Glory!\", an event that celebrated the 25th anniversary of the Monty Python troupe and was produced by Martin Lewis for the American Cinematheque. Innes performed two sold-out gigs at Los Angeles's Troubadour Club under the name \"Ron Nasty & The New Rutles\", using a local Beatles tribute band. Following the success of the shows, Lewis and Innes collaborated on the project that became Archaeology."@en ;

The album has more of a dance-oriented sound, featuring styles of dance-punk, new wave, and electropop, marking a departure from the band's post-punk sound, which was featured on their past two albums. Upon release, the album received generally favourable reviews from music critics and had a positive commercial performance, peaking at number two on the UK Albums Chart, number nine on the US Billboard 200, and charting in the top ten in several other countries.

	dbo:abstract	"Tonight is the third studio album from R&B group Silk, released on March 23, 1999 on Elektra Entertainment. It was their first album in four years and the reason for the break was due to the group wanting to be more involved in the creative process. Another reason for the hiatus was due to the lackluster performance of their previous album, which caused the group to seek new management after dealing with financial and legal issues. After severing ties with their former managers, they were managed by Sonja Norwood, mother of singer/actress Brandy. They were soon given the green light to record a new album by Elektra's then-president Sylvia Rhone, who let them take their time to record the album until they had the right songs. Most of the production duties were split between group member Gary Jenkins and producer Darrell \"Delite\" Allamby. The latter was brought in due to his previous work with Gerald Levert (\"Thinkin' Bout It\" and \"Taking Everything\"), Busta Rhymes (\"What's It Gonna Be?!\") and LSG (\"My Body\"). They also have production from Maurice Wilcher, a singer that was formerly signed to Dr. Dre's label Aftermath Entertainment. The album features the Hits \"If You\", which peaked at #13 on the Billboard Hot 100 (their biggest hit since \"Freak Me\" in 1993) and \"Meeting In My Bedroom\". Tonight proved to be their second most successful album, right behind their 1992 debut Lose Control. The album was certified platinum by the RIAA in 1999."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Vheissu (pronounced \"vee-sue\") is the fourth studio album by Thrice. It was released on October 17, 2005 by Island Records and peaked at #15 on the Billboard 200 chart. The album was released in two separate versions, including a limited edition version containing a booklet detailing the creation process of each track. The album is characterized by many critics as being a rather experimental deviation from Thrice's post-hardcore roots, with the implementation of elements such as piano melodies (\"For Miles\"), electronica (\"Red Sky\"), folk Japanese music-box undertones (\"Music Box\" - The melody comes from the song Sakura Sakura) and chain gang chant choruses (\"The Earth Will Shake\"). UK producer Steve Osborne, whose past credits include many Brit-pop hits, was sought by Thrice to gain a new perspective on the songwriting process, enabling the band to expand their musical influences and produce a different album. According to an interview with drummer Riley Breckenridge, the group recorded the album at Bearsville Studios, the same place he recorded drum tracks for 2003's Artist in the Ambulance. In describing reasons for returning to Bearsville, Breckenridge said, \"It's so secluded and so cut off from everything ... and it was really cool to kinda separate ourselves from the rigors of being at home and the distractions of friends and families, and traffic and the L.A. and Orange County lifestyle.\" The album artwork was created by author Dave Eggers and artist Brian McMullen. Eggers has said that he had not done freelance design in years, but after meeting the band and reading the lyrics he was happy to be involved in the project. Prior to the album release date, a four-part series of podcasts discussing the making of the album was released by the band, giving previews of each track and how it was recorded. The morse code at the beginning of \"Image of the Invisible\" spells out the album's title. The first track on Vheissu \"Image of the Invisible\" was featured on the soundtrack for Tony Hawk's American Wasteland."@en ;

Capitalising on the success of On a Storyteller's Night, Magnum changed to a more commercial direction with Vigilante. Produced by Roger Taylor and David Richards, the band's sound stepped towards that of Queen, with keyboards much higher in the mix than guitar. The album was recorded at Queen's famous Mountain Studios in Montreux. Three singles were released to promote the album, \"Lonely Night\", \"Midnight (You Won't Be Sleeping)\" and \"When the World Comes Down\". Tracks such as \"Lonely Night\", \"Need a Lot of Love\", \"Midnight (You Won't Be Sleeping)\" and \"Vigilante\" laid the groundwork for the group to reach their commercial and creative peak on their follow-up UK Top 5 album, Wings of Heaven. Vigilante entered the UK national charts at No. 24, and No. 11 in the Heavy Metal charts.

It peaked within top ten in most European countries, United States, Canada, Australia and New Zealand, and received numerous platinum and multiplatinum awards.The IFPI also certified it three times platinum in 2000 for sales exceeding three million copies in Europe.

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/You\u0027ll_Never_Walk_Alone_(Elvis_Presley_album)>	rdf:type	schema:MusicAlbum ;
	dbo:abstract	"You'll Never Walk Alone is a gospel compilation album by Elvis Presley, released in 1971 on RCA Camden. The album consisted primarily of previously released Gospel recordings by Presley dating back as far as 1957, plus two unreleased tracks. The single \"You'll Never Walk Alone\", an adaptation of the Oscar Hammerstein II and Richard Rodgers standard, was a minor hit for him in the late 1960s. Two previously unissued recordings are included: \"Let Us Pray\" from the soundtrack of Presley's 1969 film, Change of Habit and \"Who Am I?\", a leftover from the early-1969 recording sessions that produced his album From Elvis in Memphis. The album reached number 69 on the Billboard 200 chart. You'll Never Walk Alone was later re-released in 2006 as part of a reissue series of Elvis' budget albums. However, at the time this album was a big seller in the United Kingdom and reached a high position. It was certified Gold on March 27, 1992, Platinum on July 15, 1999, and 3x Platinum on January 6, 2004 by the Recording Industry Association of America. The album is a companion to RCA-Camden's reissued version of Elvis' Christmas Album, as it contains the four gospel recordings from the original 1958 release of that album, which were omitted from RCA-Camden's 1970 reissue. The original 4 gospel songs were issued in 1957 as an RCA Victor EP titled \"Peace in the Valley\". Although there would be further RCA-Camden collections, this was the final release that featured previously unreleased tracks. The main RCA label later revived the idea of collecting unissued recordings with its Elvis: A Legendary Performer series starting in 1974. The track listing below shows the songs as they appeared on the re-release of this album in 2006. The original L.P. released in 1971 included an additional song at the end of side 2, Swing Down Sweet Chariot, taken from Elvis' 1969 movie The Trouble With Girls."@en ;

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/(Miss)understood>	rdf:type	schema:MusicAlbum ;
	dbo:abstract	"(Miss)understood is the seventh studio album by Japanese singer-songwriter Ayumi Hamasaki, released January 1, 2006 by Avex Trax. Hamasaki acted as the album's sole lyricist, as she had on all of her preceding albums. (Miss)understood marked new musical directions for Hamasaki: she explored new influences such as funk and used gospel choruses in some of the songs, foreign to her previous works. This was the result of her having heard compositions by Geo from Sweetbox and asking him for his works; subsequently, Hamasaki rewrote the lyrics to fit (Miss)understood. Lyrically, the album was a departure from her previous work, My Story, which had been primarily autobiographical. Where My Story had contained \"musings about her past\", Hamasaki wanted the lyricism on (Miss)understood to send a strong message to all women\u2014to be a kind of \"girls' talk\" to give \"moral support\", while at the same time reminding women that there were times when they would feel weak and low. These themes, along with the album's funk influences, are epitomized on songs such as \"Bold & Delicious\" and \"Ladies Night\". \"Step You/Is This Love?\" was released as the lead single from (Miss)understood on April 20, 2005. It was a commercial success, reaching number one in Japan and receiving a Platinum certification, selling 345,340 copies in its chart run. It was the nineteenth best-selling song in Japan in 2005, and Hamasaki's best-selling single that year. Second single \"Fairyland\" was released August 3, and debuted at number one in Japan. It sold 170,000 copies in its first week, the most of any single from (Miss)understood. It went on to sell 316,663 copies, receiving a platinum certification. The third single, \"Heaven\", experienced similar success: it reached number one, and was certified Platinum, selling around 325,000 copies. \"Bold & Delicious/Pride\" was not as successful. Despite reaching number one, it became her poorest-selling single at the time since 1998's \"Depend on You\", selling only 133,000 copies. (Miss)understood was commercially successful, opening at number one in Japan (her eighth consecutive record to do so) with first-week sales of 653,830 copies. It went on to sell over 877,000 copies in Japan in its 31-week chart run, receiving a Million certification and becoming the 8th best-selling album of 2006. It is, to date, her last Million-certified album. According to Avex, (Miss)understood sold 1,030,000 copies worldwide."@en ;

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/1990_(The_Temptations_album)>	rdf:type	schema:MusicAlbum ;
	dbo:abstract	"1990 is a 1973 album by The Temptations for the Gordy (Motown) label, their final LP written and produced by Norman Whitfield. The LP was the center of a number of problems. The Temptations were dissatisfied with Whitfield's socially conscious message tracks, which were by now failing commercially, and desired to get back to singing ballads. Whitfield relented some here, placing message tracks such as \"1990\" and \"Ain't No Justice\" alongside love songs such as \"Heavenly\" and \"You've Got My Soul on Fire\". The album's first single, the Rose Royce-backed and Dennis Edwards-led funk track \"Let Your Hair Down\", was its only Top 40 hit. The ballad \"Heavenly\", sung by Richard Street and Damon Harris, was caught in the center of a disc jockey boycott against Motown. A Motown executive did not thank the United States' DJs while accepting an award for the Temptations at the 1974 American Music Awards, and, as a result, the DJs refused to play \"Heavenly\". \"You've Got My Soul on Fire\", another Edwards-led funk track, also stalled out on the pop charts. The Temptations remained dissatisfied with Whitfield's \"slave-driver\" like production mentality and his tendency to overshadow the Temptations' contributions to their own records by emphasising his production techniques and creating extended instrumental tracks with only a few verses of vocals. Group leader Otis Williams complained to Motown chief Berry Gordy, who replaced Whitfield with Jeffrey Bowen for their next LP, 1975's A Song for You. Whitfield left Motown soon afterward, and started his own label, Whitfield Records, which released several hits from Rose Royce."@en ;

Recording sessions for the album took place at RCA Victor's Music Center of the World Studio in February and December 1963 and January 1964. The cover photo was taken by American photographer Wallace Seawell. Ain't That Good News was the final album to be issued during Cooke's lifetime, before his death at the age of 33. With the exception of \"Another Saturday Night\", which had been released as a single early in the previous year, Ain't That Good News comprised the first material that Cooke had recorded in the six months following the drowning death of his 18-month-old son Vincent. As the first album that Cooke recorded and released under his new contract with RCA, Ain't That Good News reached #34 on the Billboard Pop Albums chart. The album is most memorable for Cooke's most well-known and signature song \"A Change Is Gonna Come\". Though only a modest hit for Cooke in comparison with his previous singles, the song came to exemplify the 1960s Civil Rights Movement. The song has gained in popularity and critical acclaim in the decades since its release. By the time of its release, five of the tracks on Ain't That Good News had already or would later be released as singles. Ain't That Good News was reissued in hybrid CD/Super-Audio CD format by ABKCO Records in June 2003 with full music and session credits."@en ;

The album was also released in international markets from December 2009. The album was preceded by the lead single, \"Down\" featuring label-mate Lil Wayne which impacted in the US on 30 June 2009 and eventually peaked at number one on 17 October 2009. The song was also Sean's highest UK chart entry reaching number three. Following the album's release, \"Do You Remember\" was released as the second single and in January 2010 peaked at number ten in the US and subsequently making him the first male artist in seven years to have his first two charting singles appear in the Hot 100 simultaneously. Accorging to aggregated music reviews site Metacritic, the album received mixed reviews by critics who scored the album 59/100. Despite success with the two lead singles from the album, the album itself only debuted at #37 on the US Billboard 200 albums chart. It was also his lowest-charting entry on the UK Albums Chart, debuting there at #62. Despite this, it has become his highest-charting album in Japan, reaching #11 on the Oricon Albums Chart."@en ;

Recording took place in London at Island, Ramport and AIR studios. Like Ferry's previous solo album, it consisted mainly of covers, with this time the exception of the last song, which gave its title to the album and was written by Ferry. Like These Foolish Things, Another Time, Another Place is essentially a cover album, featuring a Bob Dylan song (\"A Hard Rain's a-Gonna Fall\" on the former LP, \"It Ain't Me Babe\" on the latter) and a standard (the title track of These Foolish Things, \"Smoke Gets in Your Eyes\" on Another Time, Another Place) but while These Foolish Things emphasized an early-'60s girl-group repertoire, Another Time, Another Place turned to soul music (Sam Cooke, Ike & Tina Turner) and country music (Kris Kristofferson, Willie Nelson, Joe South). This choice of repertoire, together with the more sophisticated settings and production, gave the album a more \"grown-up\", serious and even reflective quality than Ferry's previous album, which sounds more fun and at times hectic."@en ;

At that time, the band's guitarist Die said it would be the most achieved sound that they have ever had. The album will deal with the theme of pain, as shown in a trailer narrated by Ry\u014D Horikawa released on November 12. The title stands for \"origin\" in Greek. This title connotes a special meaning to the members as it encompasses every phase the band has been evolving into. Vocalist Kyo said via Dir En Grey's website : \"This album is being worked on with me thinking about the past and future of myself as a vocalist, more than I have had ever before. That place where the old me and the new me crosses is what is being put into the 9th album \u201CARCHE\u201D\u2019\".

	dbo:abstract	"Brandy is the self-titled debut album by American R&B singer Brandy. It was released by Atlantic Records on September 27, 1994 in North America, December 5 in the United Kingdom and on several dates in Europe and Oceania, starting on February 3, 1995. The album contains a range of contemporary genres, and the songs are a mix of soft hip hop soul, pop and contemporary mid\u20131990s R&B. They were chiefly produced by Keith Crouch who would contribute all four single releases from the album. Aside from Crouch, Norwood worked with a range of other writers and producers, including R&B group Somethin' for the People, Arvel McClinton, and Damon Thomas and young Robin Thicke. Upon release, Brandy received generally positive reviews from music critics, who complimented Norwood's appearance, as well as the album's timeless appeal. It became a commercial success as well. While initial sales were slow, the album reached the top 20 of the US Billboard 200 was certified four-times platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), selling over two million copies in the United States. It experienced similar success in Australia and Canada, where it was platinum and gold respectively. Worldwide, the album has sold over six million copies. Four singles were released from the album, two of which became number-one hits on the Billboard Hot R&B Singles. \"I Wanna Be Down\" was chosen as the album's lead single, reaching the top ten in the United States and the top 20 in Australia and New Zealand. The song was critically lauded, and was regarded as a standout track on Brandy. The album's second single, \"Baby\" was also well received and charted even higher. With the following two singles, \"Best Friend\" and \"Brokenhearted\" also reaching the top ten in the US, Norwood established herself as one of the most successful of the new breed of urban R&B female vocalists to emerge during the mid-to late 1990s. It also garnered Norwood two Grammy Award nominations for Best New Artist and one for the album's second single, \"Baby\" for Best Female R&B Vocal Performance at the 38th Grammy Awards in 1996."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Breakthrough is the second studio album by American singer-songwriter Colbie Caillat. The album was released on August 19, 2009 through Universal Republic Records. The follow-up to her successful debut album, Coco (2007), Breakthrough was developed in late 2008 when Caillat returned to her home after two years on tour, with the singer setting up a \"writing camp\" with songwriters and producers in Hawaii and writing over 40 songs for the record. Inspired by the fact that she was trying to find herself again and breaking the creativy chains that surrounded her, Breakthrough deals with themes of growing up, experiencing life, love, making mistakes and learning from them, as well as heartbreak and why everlasting love seems elusive. To help develop her expected sound and lyrics, Caillat worked with previous collaborators, such as Mikal Blue, Ken Caillat and Jason Reeves, while working for the first time with Kara Dioguardi, Rick Nowels, John Shanks and Greg Wells. Breakthrough received generally mixed to favorable reviews from contemporary music critics, with some praising its rich texture and for being a consistent album with catchy tracks, while others dismissing its title and finding issues with some of the song's lyrics. The album was nominated for Best Pop Vocal Album at the 52nd Grammy Awards. Commercially, it was successful in the United States, debuting at number one on the Billboard 200, selling 106,000 copies in its first week, becoming her first album to top the Billboard charts. Elsewhere, it reached the top-ten in four countries, while failing to replicate the success of her debut album in other territories. The album produced two singles. The first single, \"Fallin' for You\", was released on June 29, 2009 and was a success on the Billboard Hot 100, reaching number twelve, while also finding success on the Adult radio. Elsewhere, it was a moderate hit. The second single, \"I Never Told You\", was released on February 16, 2010, and found similar success on the Adult charts, while being more moderate on the Billboard Hot 100. To promote the record, Caillat embarked on her Breakthrough World Tour (2009-2010)."@en ;

With the hit songs \"For All We Know\", \"Rainy Days and Mondays\" and \"Superstar\", Carpenters solidified Karen Carpenter's reputation as one of the most accomplished vocalists of the 20th century. It has been said that the strength of these recordings is what caused Richard Carpenter to ask his sister to front the band for their live performances instead of playing behind the drums. Amongst many fans, the album has simply been referred to as \"The Tan Album\", because the original LP cover, complete with overlapping flap, looked like an oversized tan envelope, and is presumably a play on The Beatles' so-called White Album. In Cash Box's Top 100 Albums of 1971, Carpenters was listed as one of the year's ten biggest albums. This is the first album to feature the familiar Carpenters logo. All lead vocals are by Karen, except on the tracks \"Druscilla Penny\", \"Saturday\", and the \"Walk on By\" segment of the Bacharach/David Medley, where Richard Carpenter sings lead vocal, with Karen in the background."@en ;

Ian Taylor had previously engineered the One On One LP in 1982 and produced a handful of other tracks from 1983's Next Position Please LP, as well as the title track for the 1983 Sean S. Cunningham comedy film Spring Break. The album features a black-and-white themed cover and a stripped-down sound reminiscent of the band's eponymous debut album 20 years earlier. It was named after the 1977 debut. Rick Nielsen and Bun E. Carlos are represented on the front cover (rather than the back) of a Cheap Trick album for the first and only time, likewise Robin Zander and Tom Petersson are relegated to the back, but their gear appears instead of the band members themselves. Some have suggested that the band chose this approach treating their debut with Red Ant/Alliance as an opportunity to re-introduce themselves as a band to a new era. Red Ant filed for bankruptcy three weeks after the album's release. There was one black-and-white video shot for the LP; \"Say Goodbye\". The Japanese version of the album featured a different album cover, a black-and-white photo of the band members.

Having been classically trained as a singer years earlier, Jennifer Rush went back to her roots (her father was a tenor) and recorded a selection of her past hits with the Hungarian Philharmonic Orchestra. These were vast reworkings of the songs, where many had been originally uptempo pop tunes were now slow and dramatic works, such as \"Ring of Ice\" and \"I Come Undone\". As well as these, four new songs were included on the collection, including lead single \"The End of a Journey\". The album was released in several European countries, reaching No.34 in the German charts. This version of \"Ring of Ice\" was released a year later as a Promo-only single to coincide with her Classics tour. Rush undertook a tour with the Orchestra based on this album in 1999, which proved popular and appeared on several television shows with them, including on one occasion, in a duet with Jos\u00E9 Carreras. Classics remained Jennifer Rush's last album for more than a decade, as she spent the next few years away from the business apart from occasional recordings on various soundtrack albums. In 2007, she released an album of previously unreleased and rare material and announced a return to the recording studio for her first album in ten years."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Dark Horse is the fifth studio album by English musician George Harrison, released on Apple Records in December 1974 as the follow-up to Living in the Material World. Although keenly anticipated on release, Dark Horse is associated with the controversial North American tour that Harrison staged with co-headliner Ravi Shankar in November and December that year. This was the first US tour by a member of the Beatles since 1966, and the public's nostalgia for the band, together with Harrison contracting laryngitis during rehearsals and choosing to feature Shankar so heavily in the program, resulted in scathing concert reviews from some influential music critics. The Dark Horse album was written and recorded during an extended period of upheaval in Harrison's personal life, when he dedicated much of his energies to business issues such as setting up Dark Horse Records. Author Simon Leng refers to the album as \"a musical soap opera, cataloguing rock-life antics, marital strife, lost friendships, and self-doubt\", due to its focus on Harrison's split with first wife Pattie Boyd and his temporary withdrawal from the spiritual certainties of his previous work. The album features an array of guest musicians \u2013 including Tom Scott, Billy Preston, Willie Weeks, Andy Newmark, Jim Keltner, Ringo Starr, Gary Wright and Ron Wood \u2013 and produced two hit singles, \"Dark Horse\" and \"Ding Dong, Ding Dong\". It showed Harrison moving towards the funk and soul musical genres. The album was not well received by the majority of critics at the time. Dark Horse was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America within days of release, but it became Harrison's first solo album not to chart in Britain. The cover was designed by Tom Wilkes and consists of a school photograph from Harrison's time at the Liverpool Institute superimposed onto a Himalayan landscape. The album was reissued in remastered form on 22 September 2014, as part of the Apple Years 1968\u201375 Harrison box set."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Destiny is the sixth studio album by American R&B/funk singer Chaka Khan, released on Warner Bros. Records in 1986. Destiny was Khan's follow-up to the platinum-selling I Feel for You and was as high tech as its predecessor\u2014symptomatically and characteristically for its period with more producers and sound engineers credited in the liner notes than musicians\u2014but was musically more geared towards rock and pop than soul and R&B, most prominently on tracks such as \"So Close\", the self-penned title track \"My Destiny\", \"Who's It Gonna Be\" and \"Watching the World\" featuring Phil Collins on drums and backing vocals. The album spun off five single releases, the first being \"Love of a Lifetime\", co-written, co-produced and featuring backing vocals by Green Gartside of British band Scritti Politti (US Pop #53, US R&B #21, UK #52). The second single \"Tight Fit\" was a midtempo R&B ballad, just like \"Eye to Eye\" from I Feel for You produced by Russ Titelman, which reached #28 on the US R&B chart. The satirical \"Earth to Mickey\" (When are you going to land?), featuring Khan both singing and rapping (and keyboardist Reggie Griffin rapping in the role of 'Mickey'), was released as the third single in early 1987 and only just made the Top 100 of the R&B chart, peaking at #93. The dramatic ballad \"The Other Side of the World\", written by Mike Rutherford of Genesis and B. A. Robertson and which had first been released as part of the White Nights soundtrack album in late 1985, reached #81. The fifth single \"Watching the World\" never charted. The album itself fared slightly better, reaching #25 on Billboard's R&B albums chart, but stalling at #67 on Pop and #77 in the UK. Destiny however gave Khan another Grammy nomination in 1987 for Best R&B Vocal Performance, Female. The track \"My Destiny\" was used as the theme song for Richard Pryor's motion picture Jo Jo Dancer, Your Life Is Calling. The closing track, the heavily edited one minute thirty-nine seconds \"Coltrane Dreams\", a tribute to John Coltrane, had a backing track mainly made up of samples of Khan's voice. The actual full-length version of the track (4:54) was only released as the B-side of the 12\" single \"Love of a Lifetime\". \"Love of a Lifetime\", \"Tight Fit\", \"Earth to Mickey\" and \"Watching the World\" were all released as 12\" singles including extended remixes. While the success of Khan's own single releases in 1986 was limited to the R&B charts, she appeared as featured vocalist/vocal arranger on two worldwide pop/rock chart hits that same year, Steve Winwood's \"Higher Love\" and Robert Palmer's \"Addicted to Love\"; on the latter she was only credited for 'vocal arrangement' in the liner notes. The song was originally recorded with Khan sharing lead vocals with Palmer but due to contractual problems between Warner Bros. Records and Island Records her own vocals were removed from the final mix."@en ;

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Duty_(album)>	rdf:type	schema:MusicAlbum ;
	dbo:abstract	"Duty is the third full-length studio album by Ayumi Hamasaki, released September 27, 2000 by Avex Trax. As with her previous works, Hamasaki wrote the album's lyrics, which share a central theme of loneliness, chaos, confusion, and the burden of the responsibilities carried with fame. Musically, Duty takes influences from rock music and rock-pop, a departure from the sound of previous effort Loveppears, which was primarily an electronic dance record. To build hype for Duty, Hamasaki released three singles between April and June 2000. These are referred to as the \"Trilogy\"; their music videos form a story about a post-apocalyptic world. Lyrically, they express hopelessness and reflect on Hamasaki's disappointment that she had failed to express herself in writing her previous songs; they also express a sense of shame in her public image. The first single, \"Vogue\", debuted at number three on the Oricon Singles chart and went on to sell over 700,000 copies. The second single, \"Far Away\", sold over 510,000 copies, but, like \"Vogue\", failed to reach the number one spot, stalling at number two. Third single \"Seasons\" became her fifth number one on the Oricon Singles chart. It remains her second-best selling single to date, with sales exceeding 1.3 million copies in Japan. Two further singles, \"Surreal\" and \"Audience\", reached the top five of the Oricon singles chart. Duty was also promoted with a number of live performances, including her first countdown concert. Duty experienced immense commercial success, debuting at number one on the Oricon Albums chart with first week sales of 1,682,760 copies and topping the chart for four weeks. It became her second consecutive album to sell over one million copies in its first week. The single \"Surreal\" was released simultaneously along with the album and the DVD Ayumi Hamasaki Concert Tour 2000 Vol.1. All three claimed the top position on the Oricon Weekly album, single, and video charts, making Hamasaki the first artist to accomplish this feat. Duty is also Ayumi Hamasaki's highest selling studio album and second best-selling release (after A Best), with sales of 2,904,420 copies in Japan. The album has been certified 3x Million by The Recording Industry Association of Japan. The album also stayed in the Top 30 for 20 weeks, and is her only album to remain in the Top 30 for that long. Duty is the 22nd best-selling album in Japan of all time and the 6th best selling Japanese album of the 21st century."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Emerson, Lake and Palmer in Concert is a live album by Emerson, Lake & Palmer (ELP), recorded at 26 August 1977 show at the Olympic Stadium, Montreal, which is featured on the album cover. It was released by Atlantic Records in November 1979, following ELP's breakup. It was later re-released and repackaged as Works Live in 1993. Some of the tracks were not from the Montreal concert, but from other concerts the 1977-1978 Tour, like \"Peter Gunn\" and \"Tiger in a Spotlight\". Similar to most live albums, In Concert showcased fan favourites of previously released material. However, \"Peter Gunn\", ELP's take on the classic TV theme song, was never released on any of their other albums (a slightly edited version of this live recording was included on the 1980 The Best of Emerson, Lake & Palmer compilation and released as a single in some countries). ELP frequently opened with this song on the Works Volume 2 tour. The band hired a 70-piece orchestra for some concerts of this tour but eventually had to dismiss the orchestra due to budget constraints that almost bankrupted the group. On the original release, the orchestra performs on \"C'est la Vie\", \"Knife-Edge\", on Keith Emerson's piano concerto, and on \"Pictures at an Exhibition\". Works Live adds other four songs performed with the orchestra: \"Fanfare for the Common Man\", \"Abaddon's Bolero\", \"Closer to Believing\" and \"Tank\". Original releases of the album carried no producer credit, but production and mixing of the album were largely carried out by Keith Emerson. Emerson's vision was to release In Concert as a double LP, but ELP's label, Atlantic Records, would not allow this given the band's pending dissolution; the album's later repackaging as Works Live somewhat restores this intent. Godfrey Salmon, the orchestra conductor, played violin on the last album from Jackson Heights, Bump n' grind in 1973. That band was Lee Jackson's group which he formed after Keith Emerson dissolved The Nice in 1970 to form ELP. Keith Emerson was also featured on that same album, on Moog programmation."@en ;
