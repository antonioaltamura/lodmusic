	dbo:abstract	"\"All Night Long\" is an independent hip-hop single by Australian artist Joel Turner. It was released on 24 February 2007 and received moderate airplay on television and radio, with influential music show Video Hits screening it only once. The song carries a party theme, with the rapping provided by Israel (an R&B singer and producer), Stan Bravo (an American-born rapper), and Turner\u2019s cousin C4 (of the Modern Day Poets). The accompanying video shows the performers and several female dancers against a backdrop of special effects. The final shot has Turner baring a T-shirt emblazoned with the words \u201CNO WAR\u201D. Although the artist is credited as \"Joel Turner featuring Israel, Stan Bravo and C4\", Turner in fact only contributes to the chorus and ad-libs, along with a few beatbox sound effects. The track does not appear on any of Turner's albums, but a version of the song can be found on Stan Bravo's mixtape Get Accustomed. \"All Night Long\" was released jointly by Turner\u2019s former record company Rajon and his current label Hardwax. Despite topping the independent charts, the song debuted at #38 on the ARIA charts and is Turner\u2019s lowest charting single to date. It received a nomination for Urban Work of the Year at the 2008 APRA Awards."@en ;

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/George_Jackson_(song)>	rdf:type	dbo:MusicalWork ;
	dbo:abstract	"\"George Jackson\" is a song by Bob Dylan, written in 1971, in tribute to the Black Panther leader, George Jackson, who had been shot and killed by guards at San Quentin Prison on August 21, 1971, during an attempted escape from prison. The event indirectly provoked the Attica Prison riot. Dylan recorded the song at Columbia Studio B, on November 4, 1971 and it was quickly released as a 45 rpm single, Columbia 4-45516, on November 12, 1971. The single consisted of a \"Big Band version\" of the song on Side A and an \"Acoustic version\" on Side B. The song was a Top 40 hit in Canada, the Netherlands, and on the US Billboard charts. The \"Big Band version\" was later included on the 1978 album Masterpieces, released in Japan and Australia. Both versions were available on iTunes as part of Bob Dylan: The Collection. This package was removed from iTunes in December of 2009. The acoustic version is available on the Side Tracks double album, included in the box set Bob Dylan - The Complete Album Collection Vol.1, released in 2013. Considered within the chronology of Dylan's work, the song \"George Jackson\" is of special significance, because, along with the single \"Watching the River Flow,\" it represents the only wholly new work to appear from Dylan in the years 1971-72, the period between the albums New Morning (1970) and Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid (1973). From the time of the appearance of his first album in 1962 until the 1990s, this was the longest period that Dylan went without releasing an album of new material (although he made several new recordings of older songs to be released for the first time in a Dylan performance on 1971's Bob Dylan's Greatest Hits Vol. II). Along with the speed with which the song was written, recorded and released following the death of Jackson, its appearance in an otherwise creatively fallow period (an outlook described in the lyrics of \"Watching the River Flow\") suggests that Dylan was strongly motivated by this subject. The song was covered by Steel Pulse on their 2004 album, African Holocaust; the album which also included an updated version of their own song 'Uncle George', which was also in tribute to George Jackson."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"Rain\" is a song by American singer and songwriter Madonna from her fifth studio album Erotica (1992). The song was released on July 17, 1993 by Maverick Records. It was released as the fifth single internationally, but the fourth single in North America. The song was produced and written by Madonna and Shep Pettibone. Lyrically, the song likens rain to the empowering effect of love, and as with water's ability to clean and wash away physical things, to also wash away pain. The lyrics also talk about waiting and hoping for love (and likely, reciprocation of feelings); per the other songs on Erotica, sexual contact is also a possible interpretation of the song. \"Rain\" received rave reviews from music critics, who felt it was an exceptional ballad amongst the overtly sexual content on Erotica. It was later compared to her single \"I'll Remember\", which was released a year later. The song experienced moderate chart success, as it peaked inside the top ten in some countries, including Canada, Japan, Australia, Ireland, Italy and the United Kingdom. An accompanying music video was released for the single, shot in black and white and colored with blue tones, featuring Madonna singing the song against various backdrops on a set. The music video was hailed by many critics, who noted its innovation and cinematography. The song was only commercially released on one Madonna compilation, this being Something to Remember (1995). It has not appeared on any other compilation since. The song was performed on only two tours of Madonna's; The Girlie Show Tour in 1993 and in a remixed version during her Sticky & Sweet Tour between 2008\u201309."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"Around the World (La La La La La)\" is the debut single by German Eurodance group ATC (also known as A Touch of Class). The song is a cover of the Russian hit \"Pesenka\" (in Russian: \u041F\u0435\u0441\u0435\u043D\u043A\u0430 'A song') (sometimes commonly known as \"Pesenka (La La La)\" by Ruki Vverh! (in Russian: \u0420\u0443\u043A\u0438 \u0412\u0432\u0435\u0440\u0445!) and uses the melody of Pesenka with additional English lyrics. The original Russian hit was written by Ruki Vverh! band members Sergey Zhukov and Aleksey Potehin and appeared in the Russian band's 1998 album Sdelai pogromche! (in Russian: \u0421\u0434\u0435\u043B\u0430\u0439 \u043F\u043E\u0433\u0440\u043E\u043C\u0447\u0435!). \"Around the World (La La La La La)\" was first released as ATC's debut single from their debut album Planet Pop on May 9, 2000 in Europe, and on May 17, 2002 in the United Kingdom. It was produced and recorded by German producer Alex Christensen on December 1, 1999 with its melody almost entirely based on \"Pesenka\". The single reached number one on the German Singles chart in 2000. It also reached number one in Austria and Switzerland, the Top 20 in Australia, Belgium, Canada, the Netherlands, Finland, France, Italy, Sweden, United Kingdom, Denmark, Poland, Romania and Scotland. It reached #24 in the Irish Singles Chart. The song was also a surprise one-hit wonder in the United States, peaking as high as number #28 on the US Billboard Hot 100 and stayed on the chart for several months. As a result, it was featured among the 2001 compilation album Now That's What I Call Music! 6, which further exposed ATC to a North American audience for one time. However, because of scant promotion for the album and a lack of touring in the USA and Canada, North America had quickly forgotten and lost interest in the act; by the end of 2001, the fan-base and growing interest in the group had drastically fallen into obscurity in North America among mainstream patrons. Contrary to the song title and prevalent only in 14 countries of Europe, Australia, Canada and USA (17 out of 196 countries of the world), the song never entered the South American, continental African and/or continental Asian, markets or charts due to ATC's limited popularity to the general public. By mid-2003, the song had declined and lost in global popularity due to ATC's disbandment, rendering it completely independent from the public forever. The song would later be used for covers, remixes and other versions after its release. In end of 2007, it was first sampled by local producer Beat Ink in his song \"Around the World\", with its melody almost entirely based on the ATC version, in its low-pitch and slow-tempo variant."@en ;

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Beauty_and_the_Beast_(Disney_song)>	rdf:type	dbo:MusicalWork ;
	dbo:abstract	"\"Beauty and the Beast\" is a song written by lyricist Howard Ashman and composer Alan Menken for Walt Disney Pictures\u2019 30th animated feature film Beauty and the Beast (1991). The film's theme song, the Broadway-inspired ballad was originally recorded by British-American actress Angela Lansbury in her role as the voice of Mrs. Potts, and essentially describes the burgeoning romantic relationship between main characters Belle and the Beast. Additionally, the song's lyrics imply that the feeling of love is both timeless and ageless \u2013 a \"tale as old as time\". \"Beauty and the Beast\" was subsequently recorded as a pop duet by Canadian singer Celine Dion and American singer Peabo Bryson, which was released as the sole single from the film's soundtrack album on November 16, 1991. Despite her extensive acting and singing experience, Lansbury was initially hesitant to record \"Beauty and the Beast\" because she felt that it did not suit her aging singing voice, but ultimately recorded the song in one take. To promote the film, Disney decided to release \"Beauty and the Beast\" as a single, and first recruited solely Dion to record a pop version of it. However, worrying that the then-obscure Canadian singer would not attract a sufficient United States audience on her own, the studio subsequently hired the more prominent Bryson as her duet partner. At first Dion was also hesitant to record \"Beauty and the Beast\" because she had just recently been fired from recording the theme song of An American Tail: Fievel Goes West (1991). First heard during the film's end credits, the single was produced by Walter Afanasieff and arranged by Robbie Buchanan, and also included on Dion's second English-language studio album. The single was accompanied by a music video, directed by Dominic Orlando. Both the film and single versions of \"Beauty and the Beast\" were very successful, garnering both a Golden Globe and Academy Award for Best Original Song, as well as Grammy Awards for Best Song Written for Visual Media and Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals. Lansbury's performance was lauded by both film and music critics. Meanwhile, despite mixed reviews, the Dion-Bryson version became a commercial success, peaking at number nine on the Billboard Hot 100. In addition to returning Disney songs to the pop charts after a thirty-year absence, the success of \"Beauty and the Beast\" also established Dion as a bankable recording artist during the 1990s. \"Beauty and the Beast\" was the first Disney song to undergo a complete pop transformation, inspiring several artists to release their own pop renditions of Disney songs throughout the decade. Beauty and the Beast was among the first animated films to use computer animation, at the time a relatively new technology which was heavily explored throughout the film's \"ballroom sequence\", during which Belle and the Beast dance to the title song. The scene has been praised for both its visuals and innovative use of computer-generated imagery, which ultimately inspired the successful computer-animated films of Pixar Animation Studios. Considered to be among Disney's best and most popular songs, \"Beauty and the Beast\" has since been covered by numerous artists. In 2004, the American Film Institute officially recognized \"Beauty and the Beast\" as one of the greatest songs in film history, ranking it 62nd."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Celebration is a song recorded by American singer and songwriter Madonna for her third greatest hits album of the same name (2009). It was written and produced by Madonna, Paul Oakenfold and Ian Green, with additional writing from Ciaran Gribbin. The song was released digitally on July 31, 2009 by Warner Bros. Records. Madonna collaborated with Oakenfold to develop a number of songs. Amongst all the songs developed by them, two were chosen for the greatest hits album with \"Celebration\" being released as the first single from it. It is a dance-oriented song with influences of Madonna's singles from the 1980s and 1990s, and consisting of a speak-sing format bridge. The lyrics of the song invites one to come and join a party. \"Celebration\" received mixed reviews from contemporary critics. It peaked at number one in Bulgaria, Finland, Israel, Italy, Slovakia and Sweden, while reaching the top five in other nations, including Canada, France, Germany, Japan and the United Kingdom where it debuted at number three on the UK Singles Chart. It became Madonna's 55th entry on the US Billboard Hot 100, where it debuted and peaked at number 71, and her 40th number-one song on the dance chart. The music video used the Benny Benassi remix of the song. It portrayed Madonna and her tour dancers solo dancing to the song. Cameo appearances were made by model Jesus Luz and in an alternative video by her daughter Lourdes. At the 2010 Grammy Awards, the song received a nomination in the Best Dance Recording category. The song was used as a closing for The MDNA Tour in which Madonna energetically danced in a glittery outfit, and at one point put on a pair of headphones and pantomimed scratching records with colored cubes falling in the backdrop."@en ;

The track was released on the album Eaten Alive in 1985 and as a single twice - in 1985 and again in 1986. According to the Gibbs biography, the brothers had initial reservations about offering the song to Ross in case it was too Motown-like for her. The single became Diana's second #1 hit in the UK Singles Chart. The song also hit #1 in Australia and was the top selling single of the year (1986) in that country. In New Zealand, it peaked at No. 3. In 1993, the song broke the UK top 20 again. The song fared poorly in the US where it initially peaked at a disappointing #95 on the Billboard Hot 100 late in 1985. A few months later, a remixed version of the song was issued as a single (Ross performed this version of the song on the American Music Awards, which she hosted that year). The new version re-entered the chart and performed better, but with the diminished momentum, it stalled at #66 in Billboard and #77 in Cash Box. Nearly thirty years later, the song stands as Ross's last appearance on both 100-position charts."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"Cherish\" is a song by American singer Madonna from her fourth studio album Like a Prayer (1989). It was written and produced by Madonna and Patrick Leonard, and was released by Sire Records as the album's third single on August 1, 1989. \"Cherish\" was built around the themes of love and relationship, with William Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet being one of the major inspirations. The track also included a line from \"Cherish\" by the 1960s band The Association. Musically constructed as a doo-wop style pop song, it is regarded as a light-hearted track by critics and includes instruments such as drum machine, percussions, keyboards and a saxophone. Lyrically, it speaks of Madonna's devotion to her lover, and her promise to be always by his side. \"Cherish\" was included on Madonna's greatest hits compilations The Immaculate Collection (1990) and the two-disc edition of Celebration (2009). After its release, the song received positive feedback from reviewers, who were surprised by the change of content and the lighter image of Madonna's music, unlike her previous singles from Like a Prayer which incorporated themes such as religion and sexuality. They compared the lyrics of the song to words spoken by Juliet, in William Shakespeare's play, Romeo and Juliet. \"Cherish\" was a commercial success, reaching the top-ten of the charts in Australia, Belgium, Canada, Ireland, Italy, United Kingdom and the combined European chart. On the Billboard Hot 100, \"Cherish\" became Madonna's 16th consecutive top-five single, setting a record in the history of the Billboard Hot 100 chart. A black-and-white music video of the song was directed by photographer Herb Ritts at the Paradise Cove Beach in Malibu, California. In the video, Madonna plays herself, while three co-actors dressed as Mermen swam in and out of the sea. Academics noted that the Mermen became symbols for the homosexual community and the oppression it faced. Madonna performed \"Cherish\" on her Blond Ambition World Tour (1990), where the performance included her dancers dressed up as Mermen. Its symbolism was seen to de-sexualize men, relegating them to objects of desire."@en ;

dbr:Dancing_Queen	rdf:type	dbo:MusicalWork ;
	dbo:abstract	"\"Dancing Queen\" or sometimes \"Dancing King\" is a song by the Swedish group ABBA, and the lead single from their fourth studio album, Arrival. It was written by Benny Andersson, Bj\u00F6rn Ulvaeus and Stig Anderson, and produced by the first two. The song was released as a single in Sweden on 16 August 1976, then in the UK and the rest of Europe a few days later. It quickly became a monumental worldwide hit, receiving extensive radio airplay and popularity at nightclubs. It became ABBA's only number one hit in the United States, also topping the charts in Austria, Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Ireland, Mexico, New Zealand, Norway, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, West Germany and Zimbabwe, and reaching the Top 5 in many other countries. Musically, \"Dancing Queen\" is a Europop version of American disco music. As disco music dominated the US charts, the group decided to follow the trend, replicating the \"Wall of Sound\". The song alternates between \"languid yet seductive verses\" and a \"dramatic chorus that ascends to heart-tugging high notes.\" It features keyboard lines by Andersson, which accentuate the melody's sophistication and classical complexity, while Ulvaeus and Andersson interlace many instrumental hooks in and out of the mix. Anni-Frid Lyngstad and Agnetha F\u00E4ltskog's layered vocals have been noted for their dynamism, \"[negotiating] the melody's many turns flawlessly.\" Lyrically, the song concerns a visit to the discotheque, but approaches the subject from the joy of dancing itself, thus having a greater emotional content than many disco songs. Widely regarded as one of the greatest pop songs of all time, \"Dancing Queen\" is considered ABBA's most enduringly popular song. According to Donald A. Guarisco of AllMusic, the track's \"sincerity and sheer musicality have allowed it to outlast the disco boom and become a standard of dance-pop.\" The song's release also cemented ABBA as an international act and signified the beginning of the group's 'classic period', which would encompass the following four years. Still a favorite at dance clubs today, it has become a standard for dance divas like Carol Douglas and Kylie Minogue, and has been covered numerous times by acts including the Sex Pistols and U2. Since its release, it has been adopted by the homosexual community, and remains one of the most ubiquitous \"gay anthems\"."@en ;

The song was a commercial success in the United States, reaching number 14 on the Billboard Hot 100 and number one on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart, becoming Brown's first number-one single on the chart since \"Say Goodbye\" (2006).

The lyrics of the opening verse seem to represent a fantasy of committing or preparing for armed assault along Rodeo Drive in Beverly Hills, California, one of the wealthiest shopping districts in the world: \"So now I'm rollin' down Rodeo with a shotgun, These people ain't seen a brown skin man, Since their grandparents bought one\". Another verse states: \"Fuck the G-rides, I want the machines that are making them.\" This is possibly a reference to workers' self-management. Another interpretation relates to taking control of production (ownership of automobile factories) as opposed to passively participating in consumption (buying automobiles) and enriching the owners of the factories. There is also a reference to Black Panther activist Fred Hampton: \"They ain't gonna send us campin' like they did my man Fred Hampton.\" The song made its live debut at a secret show on April 19, 1996, at The Dragonfly in Los Angeles, California."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"Edge of Seventeen\" is a song written and recorded by American singer-songwriter Stevie Nicks. It was the third single from her 1981 solo debut album, Bella Donna. Written by Nicks to express the grief resulting from the death of her uncle Jonathan and the murder of John Lennon during the same week of December 1980, the song features a distinctive, chugging 16th-note guitar riff, and a simple chord structure typical of Nicks' songs. Released as the third single from Bella Donna in early 1982, it barely missed out on the Top 10 of the Billboard Hot 100 making #11 and the live version on the B-side reached #26 on Billboard's Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks chart. The album track had previously made the Top 5 of Billboard's Mainstream Rock chart in 1981, peaking at number four. Despite not reaching the top ten, it became one of Nicks' most enduring and recognizable songs, and has been covered by many artists, notably Lindsay Lohan on her 2005 album A Little More Personal (Raw). The distinctive riff was sampled by Destiny's Child in their 2001 song \"Bootylicious\", with Nicks making a cameo appearance in the music video playing a guitar."@en ;

When included on the 1992 compilation album Twice Upon a Time: The Singles, the track was presented in still another version, which was neither the main single version (which is the same as the version on Superstition) nor the Junior Vasquez \"Vertigo Mix,\" which was the fourth track on the single. \"Fear (of the Unknown)\" received moderate airplay on American alternative rock radio, peaking at number 12 on Billboard magazine's Modern Rock Tracks chart.

	dbo:abstract	"\"Forever\" is a song by American recording artist Chris Brown from Exclusive: Forever Edition, a repackaged edition of his second studio album Exclusive. Brown co-wrote the song with Andre Merritt, Rob Allen, Brian Kennedy, and Jamal \"Polow da Don\" Jones; the latter two are also the producers. Initially created to be used for Ableton Live practice, \"Forever\" was selected to be released as the first single from Brown's repackaged second studio album. It was first released for digital download on November 2, 2007. The song's musical structure differs from Brown's previous work, opting for a more European techno dance sound. \"Forever\" was met with critical and commercial success. Music critics praised it as a catchy dance tune while others found it weak and too similar to music by other R&B artists. The song reached number one in Ireland and New Zealand as well as peaking within the top ten in Australia, Canada, United Kingdom and United States. It also hit the top thirty in countries like Denmark, Germany and Switzerland. The accompanying music video features Brown in several scenes pursuing his love interest. The video features much dancing and digital effects. The official remix features Lil Wayne and Lupe Fiasco."@en ;

Released on October 12, 2012, \"Forever\" was written by band members Alana Haim, Danielle Haim and Este Haim, while production was done by the band with Ludwig Goransson. The song is a pop rock track, with clattering percussion and tight harmonies. Lyrically, the track talks about a relationship's do-or-die moment, while its sound was compared to many 80's and 90's tracks, including Fleetwood Mac and its member, Stevie Nicks, Donna Lewis and even Michael Jackson's \"Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'\". Acclaimed by music critics, \"Forever\" was named a \"killer single\", with a dazzling chorus, and some even called one of the best singles of the year. \"Forever\" became the band's first charting single on the charts, reaching moderate positions in Belgium, France, Japan and the United Kingdom, while in the U.S., the song charted in multiple Billboard charts, including the Adult Pop Songs, Alternative Songs, Pop Songs and Rock Songs lists. A music video for the song features the three sisters rocking out in their living room and on their bikes and in a nail salon and all over town, all intercut with videos from their childhood.

It was released by Columbia Records on March 10, 1996, as an airplay-only single from the album. The song was written and produced by Carey and Walter Afanasieff, and was composed throughout 1995. Its lyrics describe a situation where the protagonist knows her relationship with her lover has withered away, however he will continue living in her memory forever. The song's music video is a collage of snippets from Carey's shows at the Tokyo Dome, during her Daydream World Tour in 1996. Most of the video is the performance of the song during one of the three Japanese shows on the tour. Serving as an airplay only song in the US, and a limited release around the world, the song achieved minimal chart success. In the United States, Billboard rules did not allow the charting of non-commercially released songs. For this reason, it did not chart on the Hot 100, however peaking at number two on the Adult Contemporary chart. Outside the US, the song peaked at number 11 in Canada, 40 in New Zealand and 44 in the Netherlands."@en ;

Lyrically, the song revolves around its protagonist having a crush on someone who is in a relationship, proclaiming she should be his girlfriend. The song has been noted to have similarities to Toni Basil's 1982 single \"Mickey\", and The Rubinoos' 1979 single \"I Wanna Be Your Boyfriend\". The songwriters of \"I Wanna Be Your Boyfriend\" sued Lavigne and Dr. Luke for copyright infringement; the suit was later settled. \"Girlfriend\" received generally positive reviews from music critics, who complimented its catchiness. The song was a worldwide success, peaking at the top spot of the charts in eight countries, including Canada, the United States, and Australia. It additionally charted in the top ten of most other countries. The song's accompanying music video, directed by The Malloys, sees Lavigne portraying three alter-egos, with all of them fighting over the same guy.

Lavigne performed the song a number of times, including at the 2007 MuchMusic Video Awards, the 2007 Teen Choice Awards, and the 2008 Juno Awards. The song's success made it a mainstay of pop music in the late 2000s. \"Girlfriend\" was certified multi-platinum in Australia and the United States. It was the top-selling songs of 2007, with over 7.3 million worldwide sales. In 2008, the song became the most viewed video on YouTube, and was the first video on the site to reach 100 million views. Rolling Stone ranked the song number thirty-five on their list of \"Top 100 Songs of 2007\" list. Several versions of the song were released with the chorus sung in multiple languages. In 2010, the song was named the ninety-fourth most successful song on the Hot 100 in the 2000s decade. Allmusic highlighted the song as one of the most significant punk-pop songs of all time."@en ;

dbr:Good_Vibrations	rdf:type	dbo:MusicalWork ;
	dbo:abstract	"\"Good Vibrations\" is a song composed and produced by Brian Wilson with words by Mike Love for the American rock band the Beach Boys. Released as a single in October 1966, it was an immediate critical and commercial hit, topping record charts in several countries including the US and UK. Characterized by its complex soundscapes, intricate harmonies, and exotic instrumentation, \"Good Vibrations\" later became widely acknowledged as one of the greatest masterpieces of rock music. Initiated during the sessions for the album Pet Sounds (1966), it was not taken from or issued as a lead single for an album, but rather as a stand-alone single, with the Pet Sounds instrumental \"Let's Go Away For Awhile\" as a B-side. It was considered for the Smile project, but instead appeared on the album Smiley Smile (1967). Most of the song was developed as it was recorded. Its title derived from Wilson's fascination with cosmic vibrations, after his mother once told him as a child that dogs sometimes bark at people in response to their \"bad vibrations\". He used the concept to suggest extrasensory perception, while Love's lyrics were inspired by the Flower Power movement that was then burgeoning in Southern California. Building upon the layered production approach he had previously formulated on Pet Sounds, Wilson recorded \"Good Vibrations\" in piecemeal using several Los Angeles studios throughout the course of eight months, resulting in a cut-up mosaic of several musical episodes marked by discordant key and modal shifts. Band publicist Derek Taylor dubbed the work a \"pocket symphony\", as it features an array of exotic instruments considered unusual for a popular song of its time, including jaw harp and Electro-Theremin, along with standard instruments played in ways novel to a pop hit, such as its cello and string bass which play a bowed tremolo over the song's chorus. Its making was unprecedented in any kind of recording, with a total production cost estimated between $50,000 and $75,000 (today $360,000 and $550,000), the highest of any music single ever produced. For \"Good Vibrations\", Wilson is credited with further developing the use of the recording studio as an instrument. The single revolutionized rock music from live concert performances to studio productions which could only exist on record, heralding a wave of pop experimentation and the onset of psychedelic and progressive rock. Its success earned the Beach Boys a Grammy nomination for Best Vocal Group performance in 1966; the song was eventually inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 1994. It has featured highly in many charts, being voted number one in the Mojo Top 100 Records of All Time chart in 1997 and number six on Rolling Stone's list of the \"500 Greatest Songs of All Time.\" The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame included \"Good Vibrations\" in its list of the \"500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll\"."@en ;

Lyrics for the song were written by Bernie Taupin and the music composed by John for his album Goodbye Yellow Brick Road. Its musical style and production were heavily influenced by 1970s soft rock. It was widely praised by critics, and some critics have named it John's best song. The song was released in 1973 as the album's second single, and entered the Top Ten in both the United Kingdom and the United States. It was one of John's biggest hits, and surpassed the previous single, Saturday Night's Alright for Fighting, in sales and popularity quickly following its release. In the US, it was certified Gold on 4 January 1974 and Platinum on 13 September 1995 by the RIAA.[citation needed] The Yellow Brick Road is an image taken from the 1939 movie The Wizard of Oz. In the movie, Dorothy and her friends are instructed to follow the yellow brick road in search of the Wizard of Oz, only to find that they had what they were looking for all along. The road leads to the Emerald City in the land of Oz, often referred to as a metaphor for \"The road that leads to life's fantasies\" or \"The road that leads to life's answers.\" The lyrics describe wanting to go back to a simpler existence after living what the narrator thought was the good life, but realizing they had simply been treated like a pet. The Wizard of Oz was reportedly the first film that Elton John's songwriting partner Bernie Taupin had ever seen, and he used the imagery in the lyrics relating to his own life as his desire to \"get back to [his] roots\".[citation needed]"@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"Have a Nice Day\" is a song by the American hard rock band Bon Jovi. Written, composed and produced by Jon Bon Jovi, Richie Sambora, and John Shanks, \"Have a Nice Day\" was the first single released from the band's 2005 album of the same name. The overall message of the song can be taken several ways, but reflects an overall theme of both tolerance and defiance, and its title has a discordant effect from its message. Musically, the song features a propulsive blast of power chords, drum beats, and sneering vocals, as well as choruses and hooks similar to Bon Jovi's previous material. It received a positive reception from critics, some of whom praised the song's arrangement and message; both favorable and unfavorable comparisons were made to the band's previous hit \"It's My Life\". \"Have a Nice Day\" was released to radio on 18 July 2005 and as a physical and digital single on 30 August 2005. It peaked in the top ten in eleven different countries, appearing on year-end charts in five of them as well. Although it only peaked at number 53 in the United States on the Billboard Hot 100, \"Have a Nice Day\" peaked at number six on the Adult Pop Songs chart and at number 38 on both the Pop 100 and Mainstream Rock charts; it also peaked at number 6 on the European Hot 100 chart. \"Have a Nice Day\" has been certified Gold in both the United States and Australia, signifying sales of 500,000 units in the former and shipments of 35,000 units in the latter. Bon Jovi has performed \"Have a Nice Day\" live, and included the song on their greatest hits album Greatest Hits, as well as on several of their video albums. The music video for \"Have a Nice Day\" was designed by ad agency Deutsch as part of a broader ad campaign to promote the album Have a Nice Day, and focuses on what the creative director of Deutsch describes as a 'pissed-off smiley face'."@en ;

The song also reached #56 on Billboard's Hot 100 Airplay chart, and peaked at #33 on both the Billboard Modern Rock Tracks and Mainstream Rock Tracks charts. It was also a hit in Australia, Brazil, New Zealand, The Netherlands and Belgium. The video, considered a \"concept\" video, as it featured highly symbolical imagery without the participation of the band, depicts a young girl and a boy at the opposite sides of a river who want to cross it, so they can be together. They plan to meet in a place where the boy thinks he can swim to the other side, but he is taken by the stream and carried away. The girl swims to him and they are finally together, but soon they realize they are heading to the tumultuous river waterfalls. Whether they survive or not is unknown. The video was shot in Iceland and its supposed religious symbolism is open to different interpretations. After the song became a success in the United States, the original video was replaced in most rotations by a new video. Shot at Voorst National in Brussels, Belgium, this version was a high intensity performance of the song, featuring all four principal band members."@en ;

Written by Ina Wroldsen and co-written & produced by Arnthor Birgisson, the song confirmed to be the EP's second single when it was released on 1 November 2010 by Fascination Records. In preparation for its release, the single was remixed to feature new vocals from American rapper Flo Rida after the rapper's single \"Club Can't Handle Me\" beat the group's previous single \"Missing You\" to number one; it was the second time they had lost the position to Flo Rida. Rochelle Wiseman jokingly said that the group would never get a number one until they collaborated with him. Flo Rida personally offered the collaboration for both his and the group's fans. Critics generally praised the song as the strongest offering from Headlines!, for being infectious, catchy and feisty, although it received negative reception for overproduction. An accompanying music video for the song was shot in Los Angeles at Fox Studios, at the end of August 2010, and features the girls dancing through a New York traffic jam.

	dbo:abstract	"\"Highwire\" is an anti-war song by The Rolling Stones featured on their 1991 live album Flashpoint. Written by Mick Jagger and Keith Richards, \"Highwire\" is one of the rare examples of the Stones taking on political issues - in this case, the fall-out from Persian Gulf War. On the song, Jagger said at the time of its release, \"It's not about the war. It's about how it started.\" Richards continued, saying, \"This is not about the war. It's about how you build up some shaky dictator. You can't build them up, 'cause then you've got to slam them down.\" The song's lyrics deconstructed the build-up to the war, and criticized the politics behind it: \"Highwire\" was released as Flashpoint's first single on 1 March 1991. It reached #29 in the UK, #57 in the US, #28 on the Modern Rock Tracks chart, and #1 on the Mainstream Rock Tracks chart. An accompanying video directed by Julien Temple was released and depicted the Stones in an industrial set performing the song."@en ;

It samples \"Hey DJ\" by the World's Famous Supreme Team, and \"The Body Rock\" by the Treacherous Three. \"Honey\" was a re-defining song in Carey's career, pushing her further into the hip-hop music world. The song was acclaimed by music critics, who called Carey's musical transition \"genuine.\" \"Honey\" was successful in the United States, becoming Carey's third single to debut atop the Billboard Hot 100, a feat that has yet to be duplicated. The song stayed at number one for three weeks. \"Honey\" also reached number one in Canada, and hit the top ten in Australia, New Zealand, Spain, Sweden, and the United Kingdom. \"Honey\" was nominated in two categories at the 1998 Grammy Awards, for Best Female R&B Vocal Performance and Best R&B Song. Carey included the song in the set-list of various live shows and future tours, where she would sing both the original and remix versions. \"Honey\" is well known for its accompanying music video, which presented a more sexual and less conservative image of Carey than had been previously seen. The video features Carey being held hostage in a mansion, which she escapes in a James Bond-themed plot. Subsequent scenes see Carey escaping her assailants on a watercraft, dancing aboard a ship with sailors, and frolicking on a beautiful island with her lover. The video garnered much coverage, as many comparisons were made between the video and the rumors of Carey's failing marriage. While Carey denied the comparisons were anything more than coincidence, many close friends including Walter Afanasieff, Carey's writing partner, felt they were more than obvious."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"Honey\" is a song by American electronica musician Moby. It was released as the first single from his fifth studio album Play on August 31, 1998. The uptempo song incorporates vocal samples from \"Sometimes\" by American blues singer Bessie Jones, while its instrumentation is built around a repeating piano riff. Moby discovered the \"Sometimes\" sample while listening to albums of folk music recordings compiled by field collector Alan Lomax. He subsequently composed \"Honey\", along with several other songs from Play, using the Lomax recordings. \"Honey\" was generally well received by music critics, who praised the song's sampling of \"Sometimes\" and cited it as a highlight of Play. Upon release, it peaked at number thirty-three on the UK Singles Chart and also charted in several other countries, including Austria and Germany. The song's music video, directed by Roman Coppola, depicts three duplicates of Moby venturing through various locations. \"Honey\" was later remixed to feature vocals from American R&B singer Kelis."@en ;

It was written by Arnthor Birgisson, Max Martin and Savan Kotecha, with production helmed by Birgisson. It was recorded by Birgisson at Westlake Recording Studios, Los Angeles, CA and The Vault, Stockholm, Sweden, who was assisted by Lewis on the songs vocal production. It was released to United States Contemporary hit radio on 8 December 2009, and throughout Europe to download digitally on 19 February 2010. \"I Got You\" is a pop ballad, and instrumentation consists of guitars and synthesizers. The song garnered a mixed response from music critics. Peter Robinson for The Guardian wrote that \"I Got You\" \"is an impressive distant relative of \"Bleeding Love\". Other critics praised Lewis' vocal performance and likened it to the structure of her cover of Snow Patrol's \"Run\". Despite this, some critics criticised the song for not being memorable. \"I Got You\" failed to achieve commercial success. It achieved a peak position of number three on the UK R&B Chart, number 14 on the UK Singles Chart, and peaked inside the top 50 singles Austria, Belgium, Germany and New Zealand. As part of promotion for the songs release as a single, an accompanying music video was shot at Venice Beach, California, and directed by Dave Meyers. The content of the video revolves around couples who try to resolve their differences and arguments. In the video, scenes of Lewis performing in front of a heart engulfed in flames and sitting on an apartment floor barefoot are intercut. In the United States, Lewis performed the song live on the Late Show with David Letterman, whilst in the United Kingdom, she performed on multiple television shows, including So You Think You Can Dance, The Alan Titchmarsh Show and The National Lottery Draws. It was included on the set list of her debut tour, The Labyrinth (2010)."@en ;

The single was released in North America as the third single from \"So\" in the U.S., the song achieved strong radio airplay and a constant MTV rotation. It reached #1 on the Billboard Mainstream Rock Tracks on September, 13 of the same year, it also peaked #26 on the Billboard Hot 100 in November 1986. It was not released as a single in the UK. However, Gabriel did release two extended versions of the song as a 12\" vinyl single in the US. The first (the Single Mix) ran 6:15. The second (the Special Mix) ran 7:14. In Australia, \"In Your Eyes\" peaked at #97 in November 1986. The song was the finale of the Secret World Tour and is the final track on the 1994 Secret World Live album, where it is over 11 minutes long and includes the extra lyrics from the Special Mix, in addition to solos by the other singers and players. It was included on the U.S. version of his 2003 compilation Hit, but not on the European or Japanese versions. In 2005, the song brought Gabriel his first Gold single, certified in the U.S. by the RIAA."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"In the City\" was the debut single by English mod revival/punk rock band The Jam from their album of the same title. It was released on 29 April 1977 and reached No. 40 on the UK Singles Chart in May 1977, making it their first Top 40 single and the beginning of their streak of 18 consecutive Top 40 singles. While only a minor hit on the charts, the song was the UK's first introduction to The Jam, and was characteristic of Paul Weller's youth anthems\u2014mod-influenced celebrations of British youth\u2014that dominated the band's early output.[citation needed] Musically, the song is in the vein of the band's first album, a mod/punk number influenced by The Who's early music, but with an energy and attitude updated for the punk era. \"In the City\" borrowed its title from an obscure Who song of the same name, which was released in 1966 as the B-side of the \"I'm a Boy\" single (and which can now be found as a bonus track on most CD re-issues of their 1966 album A Quick One). The Sex Pistols' single \"Holidays in the Sun\", released six months after The Jam's \"In The City\", took its descending introductory chord pattern from the latter.[citation needed] Lyrically, the song is a celebration of youth in the big city, and of what Paul Weller called the \"young idea\", reflecting Weller's optimism for the punk movement. There was also a direct reference to police brutality: \"In the city there's a thousand men in uniform/And I hear they now have the right to kill a man\". In May 2002, Polydor Records decided to commemorate the 25th anniversary of The Jam by re-releasing their debut single in its original packaging, in its original 7\" vinyl record format and at its original price of 75 pence. The limited pressing sold out immediately, and the song made the Top 40 one more time, peaking at No. 36; higher than it did in its original release and two subsequent reissues. It became the first single to chart in the UK Top 40 based alone on limited edition 7\" sales since the late 1970s. Only one single (\"Freakin' Out\" by Graham Coxon) has since charted in the UK Top 40 alone on limited edition 7\" single sales.[citation needed] Pitchfork Media ranked the track as being one of the \"great debut singles\"."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"Innuendo\" is a 1991 song by the British rock band Queen. It is the opening track on the album of the same name, and was released as the first single from the album. The single went straight to Number 1 in the UK Singles Chart in January 1991. At six and a half minutes, it is one of Queen's epic songs and their longest ever released as a single, exceeding \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" by 35 seconds. The song has been described as \"reminiscent\" of \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" because it was \"harking back to their progressive rock roots\". It features a flamenco guitar section performed by Yes guitarist Steve Howe and Brian May, an operatic interlude and sections of hard rock that recall early Queen, in addition to lyrics inspired in part by lead singer Freddie Mercury's illness; although media stories about his health were being strenuously denied, he was by now seriously ill with AIDS, which would claim his life in November 1991, 10 months after the single was released. Accompanied by a music video featuring animated representations of the band on a cinema screen akin to Nineteen Eighty-Four, eerie plasticine figure stop-motion and harrowing imagery, it has been described as one of the band's darkest and most moving works. AllMusic described the song as a \"superb epic\", which deals with \"mankind's inability to live harmoniously\"."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"Karma Chameleon\" is a song by English band Culture Club, featured on the group's 1983 album Colour by Numbers. The first recorded use of the phrase \"karma chameleon\" was sung by Toots and the Maytals at the end of the song \"In The Dark\" on their album \"Funky Kingston.\" The single spent three weeks at number one on the US Billboard Hot 100 in early 1984, becoming the group's biggest hit and only US number-one single among their many top 10 hits. \"Karma Chameleon\" was also a huge global hit, hitting number one in 16 countries worldwide, and the top 10 in several more. The sleeve features work from the photographer David Levine. In the group's home country of the United Kingdom, it became the second Culture Club single to reach the top of the UK Singles Chart (after \"Do You Really Want to Hurt Me\"), where it stayed for six weeks in September and October 1983, and became the UK's biggest-selling single of the year 1983. To date, it is the 31st best-selling single of all time in the UK, selling 1.49 million copies there. It has sold over 5 million global copies, making it one of the best-selling singles of all time worldwide."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"Kicks\" is a song by American rock band Paul Revere & the Raiders. Barry Mann and Cynthia Weil wrote the song for The Animals, but the band's lead singer Eric Burdon turned it down.Instead, Paul Revere & The Raiders recorded and released it as a single in 1966. The single was a number one hit in Canada, and reached number four in the United States. \"Kicks\" was included on the band's fifth album, Midnight Ride, released in May 1966. A live version of the song was recorded on the band's 1996 Greatest Hits Live compilation album. Considered one of the earliest anti-drug pop songs, \"Kicks\" was composed and released during an era in which pro-hippie, pro-experimentation, and other counterculture themes were gaining popularity on U.S. FM radio stations.The song's message was consequently perceived as outdated by the emerging youth counterculture, as popular artists ranging from The Beatles to Jefferson Airplane had written songs whose themes sharply contrasted that of \"Kicks.\" However, the song has received generally positive reviews by music critics in the decades since its release. In 2004, \"Kicks\" was ranked number 400 on Rolling Stone's list of The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time."@en ;

It received generally positive reviews from music critics, with several critics predicting that it would be the summer hit of 2013, even though it wasn't. \"Live It Up\" experienced moderate commercial success worldwide, entering the top-twenty in twelve countries including the United Kingdom, Canada and Australia; however, in the United States the song only managed to reach number 60, thus failing to achieve the same commercial success as Lopez's previous collaborations with Pitbull.

The music video uses quick switching of the scenes featuring the band and the gang, this has been noted by many who have seen the video as off putting due to the speed the scene changes are made which were likened to that of those that can cause epileptic seizures.

	dbo:abstract	"\"Mozambique\" is a song written by Bob Dylan and Jacques Levy that was originally released on Dylan's 1976 album Desire. It was also released as a single and reached #54 on the Billboard Hot 100. At the time of the song's release, the titular country of Mozambique had just emerged from a ten-year insurgency war against Portugal which led to Mozambique's independence. As a result, some left wing supporters wanted to see the song as lending support to the newly independent country. However, the lyrics of the song don't support such an interpretation, being slight and treating the country as merely a place for a romantic getaway in the sun, apart from a fleeting reference to \"people living free\". This angered some of Dylan's fans. Music critic Paul Williams suggests that \"Mozambique\" may have had its genesis in Dylan's desire to write a song about Marseilles. The melody received more praise than the lyrics. Robert Shelton describes the tune as \"playful.\" Authors Oliver Trager and John Nogowski both describe the melody as \"great\" and particularly praise the violin playing of Scarlet Rivera. Author Oliver Trager describes \"Mozambique\" as \"a light love song with lighter political overtones.\" Allmusic critic Stephen Thomas Erlewine calls it \"effervescent\" and \"Dylan at his breeziest.\" Paul Williams considers \"Mozambique\" to be one of several songs on Desire with \"wonderful, inventive, pleasure-giving\" music which nonetheless fails to reach the intensity and unity of the other songs because the lyrics are \"a little too vague, too clever\" and \"too distanced.\" Dylan biographer Clinton Heylin considers the song to be a \"ditty dredged up from the bottom of the barrel,\" \"ghastly\" and \"the weakest song on Desire.\" \"Mozambique\" was also released as a single as a follow up to the Top 40 hit \"Hurricane\" and it reached #54 on the Billboard Hot 100. Heylin suggests that Dylan may have released it as a single over songs fans might have preferred\u2014particularly \"Sara\"\u2014to spite fans who criticized the song for its slight lyrics trivializing the conflict in Mozambique. The song also appeared on the compilation album Masterpieces. A live performance was included in the television special Hard Rain but not on the associated album."@en ;

Written by Miracles members Smokey Robinson, Bobby Rogers, and Pete Moore and produced by Robinson, the song was a top 20 pop hit in the United States, and a top 5 hit on the R&B charts. An extension of the theme from the group's #1 hit \"My Girl\", which had been released the previous December, \"My Baby\" features The Temptations, with David Ruffin on lead, bragging about the qualities of a special lady. Ruffin praises his woman's hairstyles (\"hair soft like a baby lamb/and I love to run my fingers through it\") and personality (\"the gold in her personality/could set Fort Knox to shame\"), and hopes that \"she digs me the way I am/but if I have to change/you know I'm gona do it for my baby\". \"My Baby\" was a notable attempt to create an uptempo danceable number for the Temptations; all of their previous Top 20 hits to this point had been either ballads or mid-tempo numbers. The single immediately following \"My Baby\", \"Get Ready\", followed the same plan, and was produced with an even faster tempo and a brassier arrangement. Unusually for Temptations singles, \"My Baby's\" B-side, the Paul Williams-led \"Don\u2019t Look Back\", was a minor hit in its own right, becoming a top 20 R&B hit and serving for several years as the Temptations' live-show closing number.\"Don't Look Back\" was actually the original \"A\" side of Gordy 7047, but was passed over by the nation's DJ's in favor of the Ruffin-led \"My Baby\",which relegated \"Don't Look Back\" to \"B\"-side status.

It was the first song Shakira wrote in English after being encouraged by American singer Gloria Estefan to record material in the language. She also produced the track along with Lester Mendez. \"Objection (Tango)\" musically combines elements of pop rock and tango, and contains instrumentation from the bandone\u00F3n and guitar. Through the lyrics of the song, Shakira aims to end a love triangle she is a part of. The song was released as the third single from the album on 6 July 2002. A Spanish version of the song, entitled \"Te Aviso, Te Anuncio (Tango)\", was also recorded by the singer. Upon its release, \"Objection (Tango)\" received generally favourable reviews from music critics, some of whom found it similar to the work of American new wave band The B-52's. Commercially, \"Objection (Tango)\" was a success and peaked inside the top ten of record charts of various countries such as Australia, Belgium, Italy, Netherlands and France. The song became the last single from the album to chart in the United Kingdom and on the Billboard Hot 100 chart in the United States, reaching numbers 17 and 55, respectively. \"Te Aviso, Te Anuncio (Tango)\" charted inside the top ten of the US Billboard Latin Pop Airplay and Latin Tropical/Salsa Airplay charts. \"Objection (Tango)\" was certified platinum and gold in Australia and France by the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) and Syndicat National de l'\u00C9dition Phonographique (SNEP), respectively.

It's about taking a look at your life and trying to figure out how you got here when you were there. It's also about Reno in 1910 and the story of Jack Johnson knocking out Jim Jefferies, who ends up lying on the ground looking at the sky thinking he\u2019s not sure how this happened, how am I here? I was there. It starts as a story about that, then changes to be about these kids and their lives and how they changed. It's the best thing I've ever written, very heartfelt.\" Durtiz expanded on a 2014 episode of Acoustic Caf\u00E9: \"I started writing this song and initially it was about a guy and a girl growing up in the '60s and '70s. I started to write about their lives, but then when we got to... the verse after the first chorus. 'You walk into the bar like some Saturday star stud straight on spiked heels and needles and nerves.' I really started to get this idea about them cross-dressing. Well at least the guy dressing up in woman's clothes. So the songs very informed about that, about people living on the fringes and trying things just cause it's interesting to try things in life. I mean cause they're interested in what's over the next hill. What does it feel like to dress up in woman's clothes when you\u2019re a guy?

	dbo:abstract	"\"Patience\" is a power ballad by American hard rock band Guns N' Roses, which appears on the album G N' R Lies and was released as a single in 1989. The song peaked at #4 on the Billboard Hot 100. The song is played using three acoustic guitars and was recorded in a single session by producer Mike Clink. A music video of the song was shot and appears on the band's music video DVD, Welcome to the Videos. The music and lyrics were both written by Izzy Stradlin. Tesla guitarist Frank Hannon later implied that Guns N' Roses had copied Tesla's earlier work, stating that a demo by Tesla called \"Better Off Without You\" was \"'Patience' note for note.\" Hannon later backtracked on his blog, saying \"The song is a great song that they wrote themselves, and it is only the end part that has any similar part to the guitar chords we used. I apologize for any controversy or dis-respect I may have projected in my joking around with Eddie Trunk about this.\" The motivation for the track is generally accepted to be the troublesome relationship between Axl Rose and his now ex-wife Erin Everly, though this was never stated in the album or interviews. According to bass guitarist Duff McKagan, \"Axl came up with a great lyric, seemingly out of nowhere, that of course became the story and melody of that song.\" It has also been stated by the band that Izzy wrote the song about his ex-girlfriend Angela Nicoletti McCoy.[citation needed] Steven Adler did not record on the track, although in some live performances prior to release of the album, such as their performance at the Orange County Fair in New York in the summer of 1988, percussion (and electric instruments) were used. In the video, the band members are situated in a hotel where they are the only constant images, as all other people are present for a moment, then fade away. More recently fans have taken another view on the song, as now Rose is the only remaining member from the original lineup. In a precognitive twist, the final parts of the video show Rose sitting alone in his home watching older Guns N' Roses videos in what appears to be a sad and lonely state. The video, directed by Nigel Dick, was one of many produced by the band. It was the last video in which Steven Adler appeared (even though he did not play on the recorded track) and the last before the Use Your Illusion videos. The video was shot in The Ambassador Hotel, famous because Bobby Kennedy was assassinated there in 1968. The hotel was inoperative and scheduled for demolition, but was not demolished until 2006."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"Piece by Piece\" is a song by American recording artist Kelly Clarkson taken from her seventh studio album of the same name. It was written by Clarkson with Greg Kurstin, who produced the record. A midtempo pop song about restoring someone's faith in love and family relationships, Clarkson promulgated the track as a sequel to the song \"Because of You\" (2004), but with a \"happy ending\". After a discussion with her sister about their family life, she introspectively co-wrote the song in a first-person narrative to her father, whose neglect of his family was used as a juxtaposition to her husband's unconditional love for her and their daughter, whom they both promised to never abandon. \"Piece by Piece\" was first released as the second promotional single from Piece by Piece by RCA Records on February 24, 2015. Upon its release, the title track has a received praise from music critics, who commended lyrical content as one of the album's highlights. Clarkson premiered the song in a live acoustic performance on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon and has showcased it on the set list of the Piece by Piece Tour. A re-worked version of the track was released to American hot adult contemporary radio stations on November 9, 2015, as the third single from the album. On February 25, 2016, Clarkson performed \"Piece by Piece\" in a live presentation on the fifteenth and final season of American Idol. The successful commercial and critical response of her performance has led RCA to issue an \"Idol version\" on February 29, 2016."@en ;

The song features his inventive guitar playing, which uses the signature Hendrix chord and a mix of blues and Eastern modalities, shaped by novel sound processing techniques. Because of ambiguities in the lyrics, listeners often interpret the song as referring to a psychedelic experience, although Hendrix described it as a love song. \"Purple Haze\" is one of Hendrix's best-known songs and appears on many Hendrix compilation albums. The song featured regularly in concerts and each of Hendrix's group configurations issued live recordings.

It has been recorded by a number of performers, often under the \"Mighty Quinn\" title. The subject of the song is the arrival of the mighty Quinn (an Eskimo), who changes despair into joy and chaos into rest, and attracts attention from the animals. Dylan is widely believed to have derived the title character from actor Anthony Quinn's role as an Eskimo in the 1960 movie The Savage Innocents. Dylan has also been quoted as saying that the song was nothing more than a \"simple nursery rhyme.\" A 2004 Chicago Tribune article also claimed that the song was named after Gordon Quinn, co-founder of Kartemquin Films, who had given Dylan and Howard Alk uncredited editing assistance on Eat the Document."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"Remote Control\" is a song by The Clash, featured on their debut album, and is written against oppression and conformity. The song was written by Mick Jones after the disastrous Anarchy Tour and contains pointed observations about the civic hall bureaucrats who had cancelled concerts, the police, big business and especially record companies. The song mentions a 'meeting in Mayfair' which probably refers to one held by EMI's shareholders on 7 December 1976, which effectively withdrew all support for the Anarchy Tour. Also alluded to in the song are the 'old-boy' peerage networks and hapless politicians. The band virtually disowned the song, following their record label CBS's decision to release the song as a single without consulting the band. The band had already told Melody Maker magazine that their next single would be \"Janie Jones\", and were irate that CBS had undermined them and made a decision to release \"Remote Control\" instead without the band's permission. To the band, the song became a symbol of everything they were fighting against. The incident was referred to in the first lines of a later song, \"Complete Control\", which is on the 1979 US release of the album: The B-side is a mono live version of \"London's Burning\". The band re-recorded the song in early summer 1979 during rehearsals at Vanilla Studios in Vauxhall for London Calling. In liner notes for \"The Vanilla Tapes\", released in 2004, which includes the song, Mick Jones is quoted as saying:"@en ;

She continually writes \"return to sender\" and he keeps receiving the letter with various reasons for returning to sender, including \"address unknown\" and \"no such person\". He keeps mailing letters, refusing to believe the relationship is over. Presley performed \"Return to Sender\" in the film Girls! Girls! Girls!. Featuring Presley's longtime cohorts Barney Kessel on electric guitar, Tiny Timbrell on acoustic guitar, Ray Siegal on double bass, D.J. Fontana on drums, Dudley Brooks on piano, Boots Randolph on baritone saxophone, and the Jordanaires on backing vocals, augmented by various session musicians, including drummer Hal Blaine, the song features an opening saxophone bar. Another saxophonist, Bobby Keys, claimed he performed the solo at the instigation of pianist Glen D. Hardin, in his 2012 memoir Every Night's A Saturday Night. However, Hardin did not meet Presley until February 1970, when he joined his touring band.

The song features American rapper Lil Wayne and was written by Madonna, Carlos Battey, Steven Battey, Dwayne Carter, Justin Franks and Brandon Kitchen. It was produced by Madonna and DJ Frank E. The single release included remixes by David Guetta and Afrojack, which won the Grammy Award for Best Remixed Recording, Non-Classical category at the 53rd Grammy Awards. This version also appears on the deluxe version of Guetta's album One More Love (2010). The single also included mixes by Paul van Dyk, Tracy Young and included remixes of \"Celebration\" by Akon and Felguk. The original album version does not appear on any formats of the release and some versions are credited as \"Madonna vs. David Guetta\". An electropop song, \"Revolver\" features Madonna singing the whole song, with a guest appearance by Wayne near the end. The lyrics talk about juxtaposing love with weaponry. Contemporary critics gave a mixed review of the song. Some praised the chorus line \"My love\u2019s a revolver\" while others felt that it was underwhelming and not on par with Madonna's previous songs. The single charted in the lower regions of the official charts of Belgium, Canada, Finland and the United Kingdom while reaching number four on the Billboard Hot Dance Club Songs chart of United States. The song was performed on The MDNA Tour in 2012, where Madonna wielded a Kalashnikov rifle onstage.

The song refers to the Biblical story of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego and the fiery furnace in the Book of Daniel. However, the lyrics \"Shadrach, Meshach, Abednego\" in the track are used and sampled from Sly Stone's \"Loose Booty\", where they are repeated and spoken rhythmically throughout the track in an almost rap-like form. In verse two, the lyric, So I'm out pickin' pockets at the Atlantic Antic, refers to an annual Brooklyn street festival of that name. Also in the song is a reference to the AC/DC album For Those About to Rock (We Salute You), in the lyrics \"For those about to rock we salute you\". The video released to promote the Beastie Boys' song was directed by Adam Yauch under his pseudonym Nathaniel Hornblower. Its style and artistic beauty (each frame was painted by hand) resulted in it being included in the 22nd International Tournee of Animation. The video can be seen on the Beastie Boys Criterion Collection DVD set. The music video was designed by famous animation studio Klasky Csupo.

The song was then released earlier than anticipated, when Grant Nicholas felt that the song's chorus fitted in with the Tsunami disaster. It first came to light in a 2006 interview with the now defunct teletext magazine Planet Sound, in which Grant Nicholas cited he was recording a track titled \"Step By Step\", before becoming \"Barbarella\" then \"Side By Side\". The artwork for the single was shot by photographer Tadashi Okubo, a photographer with the Yomiuri Shimbun newspaper. It depicts Yuko Sugimoto, a 29-year-old mother whose 5-year-old son Raito was later found by the Japanese military. It was taken at 07:00 local time in Ishinomaki on 13 March 2011. She is looking in the direction of the remains of her son's playschool. The photo was chosen by Mikey Eaton for the single release.

	dbo:abstract	"\"Skeletons\" is a number-one R&B single performed by American recording artist Stevie Wonder from his 1987 Characters album. The song earned Stevie Wonder two 1988 Grammy Award nominations for Best R&B Song and Best Male R&B Vocal Performance, while the album Characters would be nominated the following year for Best R&B Male Vocal Performance. \"Skeletons\" went to number one on the Black Singles Chart, and peaked on the Billboard Hot 100 at number 19, and was the final top 40 hit for Wonder to date. The single also peaked at number 20 on the US dance chart. The song is an R&B and synthpop record about lies and deceptions being uncovered. One version features short sound bites from prominent figures such as Col. Oliver North (\"I am not ashamed of anything in my professional and personal conduct\") and President Ronald Reagan (\"The United States has not made concessions to those who hold our people captive in Lebanon\") among others. This has remained a popular R&B uptempo song for Stevie Wonder, as well receiving airplay from urban radio stations. The song was featured in the 1988 action film Die Hard, played when the character Argyle speaks on the phone. The song was also used in the second trailer of the video game Grand Theft Auto V, as well as appearing on the in-game radio station Space 103.2, reigniting the popularity of the song on sites such as YouTube."@en ;

It was written by Adele and producer Paul Epworth and features orchestration by J. A. C. Redford. Film company Eon Productions invited the singer to work on the theme song in early 2011, a task that Adele accepted after reading the film's script. While composing the song, Adele and Epworth aimed to capture the mood and style of the other Bond themes, including dark and moody lyrics descriptive of the film's plot. \"Skyfall\" was released at 0:07 BST on 5 October 2012 as part of the Global James Bond Day, celebrating the 50th anniversary of the release of Dr. No, the first James Bond film. The song quickly went to the top of the iTunes chart, and reached number two at the UK Singles Chart and eight on the Billboard Hot 100. Reviews were positive, with the song being compared to Shirley Bassey's Bond themes, and \"Skyfall\" became the first Bond theme to win at the Golden Globes, the Brit Awards and the Academy Awards.

During the band's greatest hits tour in 2013 Scott Robinson and Abz Love have changed the lyrics of the song.

Several critics felt its production was reminiscent of Meghan Trainor's sound. Lyrically, \"Smile\" conveys a positive message \"about loving and appreciating yourself and doing all the simple things in your life to make yourself smile and be ultimately happy.\" The song received mixed reviews from critics; some complimented its fun pop sound, while others criticised the simple production and Im for following Trainor's sound. Upon its release, \"Smile\" debuted at number 48 on the Australian ARIA Singles Chart, number 55 on the South Korea Gaon International Download Chart and number 63 on the South Korea Gaon International Digital Chart. The accompanying music video features Im performing random acts of kindness as she gives out flowers, balloons, free coffee and drinks to people in the streets of Sydney, and visits a nursing home and childcare centre.

	dbo:abstract	"\"Smile\" is the debut single by British recording artist Lily Allen from her debut studio album Alright, Still (2006). It was written by Allen, Iyiola Babalola and Darren Lewis, while sampling The Soul Brothers' \"Free Soul\". The song was released as the lead mainstream single of the album in July 2006. After signing a contract deal with Regal Recordings and gaining popularity on the social network website Myspace with demo songs, Allen released a limited edition of \"LDN\" to promote her work and afterwards announced the release of \"Smile\". The song incorporates rocksteady music, as the lyrics tackle her dealing with the betrayal of her boyfriend, while enjoying his misery. Most contemporary critics complimented the song, noticing the confidence it hides and the carnival-esque, yet melancholy, theme. On the other hand, some considered it was not one of the album's best tracks and it makes the singer a \"theoretical pop princess\". The single peaked inside the top 40 of the charts of some European countries and Australia, while staying on the summit of the UK Singles Chart for two consecutive weeks and ended the year as the country's 11th most successful song. It is also charted on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100, where it was certified gold. For promotion, \"Smile\" was re-recorded in Simlish and played on shows; it also received its own answer song. The accompanying music video portrayed a revenge theme, with Allen hiring a posse to beat her ex-boyfriend. It was directed by Sophie Muller and, afterwards, banned on MTV due to obscene language. The song was performed live many times, including on talk shows, her 2007 concert tour and also during her 2009 concert tour, though Allen claimed to be \"sick\" of it. In 2008, it won a Pop Award at the London Broadcast Music Incorporated Awards."@en ;

Written by Allen and Greg Kurstin, the song was released as the lead single of the album. Initially, \"Everyone's at It\" was announced to be the first single from the album. However, it was ultimately decided on \"The Fear\" to be released on 26 January 2009 by Regal Recordings, while the demo (which was then titled \"I Don't Know\") leaked onto the Internet in April 2008. The song incorporates electropop music as the lyrics articulate problems with celebrity lifestyles and include metaphors for recognised tabloid national newspapers such as The Sun. \"The Fear\" also references, albeit indirectly, the Great Depression of the 1930s. Contemporary critics complimented the song and its themes of consumerism and the postmodern condition. \"The Fear\" peaked at number one on the UK Singles Chart, where it remained for four weeks. The single peaked also inside the top 20 of the charts of some European countries and Australia. It is also Allen's second chart entry in the U.S. Billboard Hot 100. The accompanying music video portrayed a fantasy theme, with Allen dancing with giant wrapped gifts and balloons. It was shot at Wrest Park in Bedfordshire and also featured dancers dressed as butlers; the locations were initially in a caravan in a park, and then in a giant colourful mansion, surrounded by contrasting grey clouds. The song was performed live for the first time via The Scott Mills Show on BBC Radio 1 and during Allen's 2009 concert tour. \"The Fear\" was awarded with Best Track prize at the 2009 Q Awards, and also won Allen two Ivor Novello Awards in 2010, for best song musically and lyrically, and most performed work."@en ;

Madonna was also inspired by actor James Stewart in the 1954 film Rear Window.

It was written by the song's producer Harmony Samuels, alongside Amber Streeter, Al Sherrod Lambert, Jordin Sparks, Priscilla Ahn, Brenda Russell, and Mac Miller, who is featured in the song. \"The Way\" was released on March 25, 2013 by Republic Records as the lead single from Yours Truly. The song's backing track is based on the piano melody from Russell's 1979 song \"A Little Bit of Love\", and the song has melodic and lyrical similarities to Big Pun's 1998 song \"Still Not a Player\", which also samples \"A Little Bit of Love\". The song received acclaim from critics, with some comparing Grande's vocals to those of Mariah Carey. Commercially, the song was successful in the United States, debuting and peaking within the top 10 of the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 becoming Grande and Miller's first top ten success on the chart. This made Grande the first top 10 arrival for a lead female artist making her first Hot 100 appearance since Yael Naim, who launched with \"New Soul\" back in 2008. Internationally, the song managed moderate chart success peaking within the top 40 of most territories. As of August 2014, \"The Way\" has sold over 3 million copies in the United States and has been certified triple platinum."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"Touch My Body\" is a song by American singer and songwriter Mariah Carey, taken from her eleventh studio album, E=MC\u00B2 (2008). It was written by Carey, along with Crystal \"Cri$tyle\" Johnson, Terius \"The Dream\" Nash and Christopher \"Tricky\" Stewart and produced by Mariah Carey and \"Tricky\" Stewart, and was released as the album's lead single on February 12, 2008. Lyrically, the song features a double message, with the first describing sexual fantasies with her lover, while also jokingly warning him against recording or releasing information regarding their rendezvous. The song received generally positive reviews from music critics, with many highlighting the song's light pop melody and hook; however, it also garnered some backlash from certain music reviewers, who felt the song did not properly represent the singer's acclaimed 5-octave vocal range. \"Touch My Body\" became Carey's eighteenth chart topper on the Billboard Hot 100, making Carey the solo artist with the most number one singles in United States history, surpassing the record held by Elvis Presley. Additionally, it gave Carey her 79th week atop the chart, tying Presley for most weeks at number one. Throughout Europe, the song also achieved high charting, peaking within the top five on the charts in Italy, Japan, New Zealand, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom. Carey performed \"Touch My Body\" on several live televised events and programs, debuting it on Saturday Night Live as a two-piece performance. Similarly, Carey opened the Good Morning America \"Summer Concert Series\" on April 25, 2008, singing the song, as well as two other singles from E=MC\u00B2. Similar renditions took place at the season premiere party of The Hills, as well as a mash-up of the song with \"I'll Be Lovin' U Long Time\" at the Teen Choice Awards. Aside from reprising performances of the British programs The Sunday Night Project and The Paul O'Grady Show, and German talent show Deutschland sucht den Superstar, the song was included on the set-list of Carey's North American Angels Advocate Tour, held throughout 2009 and 2010. The song's music video was directed by filmmaker Brett Ratner, who had previously worked with Carey on five other music videos. It follows around a story revolving around a computer employee's fantasy as he visits Carey's home. As he fixes her computer, he enters a fantasy in which the pair perform several activities together, including pillow fights, laser tag, Guitar Hero, slot cars, and frisbee throwing, all while Carey shows off her figure in several revealing outfits. The music video won in the category of \"Best Comedic Video\" at the 2008 BET Awards, and won the \"MTV Video Vanguard Award\" at the 2008 MTV Video Music Awards Japan. Additionally, the video was nominated for \"Best Female Video\" at the 2008 MTV Video Music Awards."@en ;

The band co-produced the track with Paul Epworth, Daniel Green and Rik Simpson, while American record producer Timbaland provided additional drums. The song's main instrumentation consists in heavy rhythms, dancing synths and wallowing strings. It also features a guitar solo. Lyrically, \"True Love\" talks about heartache and how the protagonist can't bear the pain of losing his lover. The song's lyrics were addressed to be about Martin's divorce from his wife Gwyneth Paltrow, a recurrent theme on the whole album. Martin has claimed that \"True Love\" is the band's favorite track it has ever written. The song garnered acclaim from music critics, who commended the song's raw honesty and its lyrics, which were seen as haunting and painfully truthful. Commercially successful in Belgium and the Netherlands, \"True Love\" did not chart on the UK Singles Chart. The accompanying music video for the song was directed by Jonas \u00C5kerlund, who also directed the \"Magic\" video. It was shot in Los Angeles, choreographed by Blanca Li and centres around a tale of two ballet-loving outsiders, played by Martin and Canadian actress Jessica Lucas."@en ;

The song was originally released as \"To Everything There Is a Season\" on The Limeliters' album Folk Matinee and then some months later on Seeger's own The Bitter and the Sweet. The song became an international hit in late 1965 when it was covered by the American folk rock band The Byrds, bowing at #80 on October 23, 1965, before reaching #1 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart on December 4, 1965, #3 in Canada (Nov. 29, 1965), and also peaking at #26 on the UK Singles Chart.

	dbo:abstract	"\"Under the Bridge\" is a song by American rock band Red Hot Chili Peppers, released on September 24, 1991 as the second single from the group's fifth studio album, Blood Sugar Sex Magik. Vocalist Anthony Kiedis wrote the lyrics to express feelings of loneliness and despondency, and to reflect on narcotics and their impact on his life. Kiedis initially did not feel \"Under the Bridge\" would fit into the Chili Peppers' repertoire and was reluctant to show it to his band mates until producer Rick Rubin implored him to do so. The rest of the band was receptive to the lyrics and wrote the music. The song became a critical and commercial success, peaking at number two on the Billboard Hot 100 and later certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America. The single's success was widened with the release of its accompanying video, which was frequently played on music television channels. It won the \"Viewer's Choice Award\" and \"Breakthrough Video\" at the 1992 MTV Video Music Awards. \"Under the Bridge\" allowed the Red Hot Chili Peppers to enter the mainstream. David Fricke of Rolling Stone said the song \"unexpectedly drop-kicked the band into the Top 10\", while Philip Booth of The Tampa Tribune commented that it was a \"pretty, undulating, [and] by-now omnipresent single.\" Its success led in part to the departure of guitarist John Frusciante, who preferred the band to remain underground. The song has become an inspiration to other artists, and remains a seminal component of the alternative rock movement of the early and mid-1990s. \"Under the Bridge\" follows \"Give It Away\" as the band's second most performed live song, having been performed over 600 times."@en ;

dbr:We_Are_the_World	rdf:type	dbo:MusicalWork ;
	dbo:abstract	"\"We Are the World\" is a song and charity single originally recorded by the supergroup USA for Africa in 1985. It was written by Michael Jackson and Lionel Richie, and produced by Quincy Jones and Michael Omartian for the album We Are the World. With sales in excess of 20 million copies, it is one of the fewer than 30 all-time singles to have sold at least 10 million copies worldwide. Following Band Aid's \"Do They Know It's Christmas?\" project in the UK, an idea for the creation of an American benefit single for African famine relief came from activist Harry Belafonte, who, along with fundraiser Ken Kragen, was instrumental in bringing the vision to reality. Several musicians were contacted by the pair, before Jackson and Richie were assigned the task of writing the song. The duo completed the writing of \"We Are the World\" seven weeks after the release of \"Do They Know It's Christmas?\", and one night before the song's first recording session, on January 21, 1985. The historic event brought together some of the most famous artists in the music industry at the time. The song was released on March 7, 1985, as the only single from the album. A worldwide commercial success, it topped music charts throughout the world and became the fastest-selling American pop single in history. The first ever single to be certified multi-platinum, \"We Are the World\" received a Quadruple Platinum certification by the Recording Industry Association of America. However, the song garnered mixed reviews from journalists, music critics, and the public. Fans enjoyed hearing racially and musically diverse recording artists singing together on one track, and felt satisfied in buying \"We Are the World\", knowing that the money was going to charity. Other individuals, including many commentators in the rock press, were disappointed that the song did not challenge listeners as to why famines occur in the first place, and felt that the lyrics were self-aggrandizing. Awarded numerous honors\u2014including three Grammy Awards, one American Music Award, and a People's Choice Award\u2014the song was promoted with a critically received music video, a home video, a special edition magazine, a simulcast, and several books, posters, and shirts. The promotion and merchandise aided the success of \"We Are the World\" and raised over $63 million (equivalent to $136 million today) for humanitarian aid in Africa and the US. Following the devastation caused by the magnitude 7.0 Mw earthquake in Haiti on January 12, 2010, a remake of the song by another all-star cast of singers was recorded on February 1, 2010. Entitled \"We Are the World 25 for Haiti\", it was released as a single on February 12, 2010, and proceeds from the record aided survivors in the impoverished country."@en ;

It was the only song to be released from the official movie soundtrack. News that Winslet was secretly recording the one-off single to vie for the 2001 UK Christmas number one spot was reported in the Daily Mirror. In the event, the song entered the UK Singles Chart at number six, and was beaten to the Christmas top spot by Robbie Williams and Nicole Kidman's version of \"Somethin' Stupid\". \"What If\" debuted at Number 1 on the Irish Singles Chart on 7 December 2001, toppling Irish television puppet Dustin's version of \"Sweet Caroline\". It remained at number 1 for four weeks. The song also topped the charts in Austria and Belgium (Flanders) singles chart, was a Top 10 hit in Germany, Switzerland and the Netherlands, and won the 2002 OGAE Song Contest. An accompanying music video, which was directed by Paul Donnellon and produced by Chris Horton, shows Winslet walking around an old Victorian house, along with clips from the film.

	dbo:abstract	"\"Who Wants to Live Forever\" is a song by the British rock band Queen. It is the sixth track on the album A Kind of Magic, released in June 1986, and was written by lead guitarist Brian May for the soundtrack to the film Highlander. The song peaked at No. 24 in the UK charts. The song is used to frame the scenes in the film where Connor MacLeod must endure his beloved wife Heather MacLeod growing old and dying while he, as an Immortal, remains forever young. (It was later used in the episodes \"The Gathering\", \"Revenge is Sweet\", \"The Hunters\", \"Line of Fire\", and \"Leader of the Pack\" of the Highlander television series). The song's title is taken from a line in another movie scored by Brian May and Queen, Flash Gordon (the line can be heard on \"Battle Theme\" from the Flash Gordon soundtrack album) and is based on May's personal troubles (the death of May's father and failing first marriage). In the film, Freddie Mercury provides all the main vocals, while May sings lead vocals on the first verse on the album version, before Mercury takes over for most of the rest of the song, with May singing \"But touch my tears with your lips\" during Mercury's verse and then the final line of the song, \"Who waits forever anyway?\". An instrumental version of the song, titled \"Forever\", was included as a bonus track on the CD version of the album. This instrumental featured only a piano, with keyboard accompaniment during the chorus sections. The piano track was recorded solely by May. Queen was backed up by an orchestra, with orchestrations by the co-composer of the film's score, Michael Kamen. Since its release, the song has been covered by a number of artists. The song was played in the series finale of Eastbound & Down."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"It's Goin' Down\" is a song performed by American rapper Yung Joc, and produced by Nitti. It was released as the first single from his debut album New Joc City. The song is part of the snap genre, popular in hip hop music from the Southern United States. In the video, people are seen snapping their fingers but no one is shown doing the dance. Instead, people are shown doing Yung Joc's dance the \"Joc-in\" which is also called \"The Motorcycle\". WWE's JTG has been seen doing this dance during his entrance and in matches. It was voted the #1 song of 2006 on MTV2's Sucker Free Countdown. It also was voted number 1 on BET's 106 & Park, and is also #1 on BET's Top 100 Songs of 2006. It was nominated at the 2007 Grammy awards for Best Rap Song but lost to \"Money Maker\" by Ludacris featuring Pharrell. It won a place on Rolling Stone magazine 's annual 100 Best Songs of the Year, ranking at a respectable #79, in the 2006 edition. 5 remixes were made for this song: the official remix features Rick Ross, Slim Thug, and Jody Breeze; one adds a verse by Cam'ron to the official remix; one features Trae; the last features Lil Wayne, Rick Ross and Currency. Rapper Lydell Lucky made a remix to the song as well, which features Paul Wall, Trae and others. The rapper The Last Mr. Bigg also redid the song.[citation needed] A number of songs have sampled lines from \"It's Goin' Down\", such as \"If Ya Girl Choose\" by Gucci Mane and \"Get Like Me\" by David Banner featuring Chris Brown."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"Let U Go\" is a song originally written by the Canadian musicians Ken Harrison and Robert Michaels as \"Wrong to Let You Go\". This pop-rock song, recorded by the Wild Strawberries, the band consisting of Harrison and his wife Roberta Carter, first appeared on volume 3 of the compilation album series Women & Songs, then on the Wild Strawberries album Twist (2000). German dance DJ and producer ATB remixed the song and released it twice as a single, it being ATB's 6th and 15th single releases. The first version of the song was released on CD 1 (The World of Movement) of ATB's second album Two Worlds, which was released in 2000. The song bore a similar sound to prior singles \"The Fields of Love\" and \"The Summer\" from the same album. A year later ATB remixed the song again for a single release. By doing this he stepped away from his traditional sound and created a harder dance track, leaving out pitch-bends and guitar sounds. Apart from these changes, a second verse was also added to the song and a new main-hook was created. The single became ATB's biggest hit in his home country Germany, as it was his first, and only, top ten single, reaching number seven. It peaked at number 34 in the United Kingdom. Eventually this version of the song appeared on his third album Dedicated, which also contained additional songs produced from the now-ongoing collaboration between Tanneberger and the Wild Strawberries."@en ;

The song's lyrics, which were penned by Furtado and Clayton, feature a conversation between a man and woman who call each other promiscuous. The overtly-sexual song was released as the lead single from the album in North America in early 2006, and as the second single elsewhere in mid-2006 except in Latin America, where the single was released as the third single in late 2006. The song was well received by music critics, with some critics calling it the highlight of the album. \"Promiscuous\" was an international success and it had become Furtado's first number-one single in the US. It is the first number one by a Canadian female artist since 1998's \"I'm Your Angel\" by R. Kelly and C\u00E9line Dion on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. The song also topped the chart in New Zealand and peaked within the top ten on many charts across Europe. The accompanying music video was directed by Little X, and features scenes of Furtado and Timbaland, in what Furtado describes as a \"verbal Ping-Pong game\". Cameo appearances are made by Keri Hilson, Justin Timberlake, and Bria Myles.

	dbo:abstract	"\"905\" is a song written and sung by bassist John Entwistle for British rock band The Who's eighth studio album, Who Are You. It makes heavy use of one of the first multiphonic Polymoog synthesizers at Entwistle's studio in Ealing. It was never performed live by the Who, but was often performed by The John Entwistle Band. However, it was released as the B-side of the second single from the album, headed by another Entwistle song, \"Trick of the Light\", making it the only single by the Who with both sides written by John Entwistle. \"905\" was written for a never completed rock opera set in the future. The lyrics describe a dystopian future, in which all people are clones. These clones are produced in laboratories by machines. During their growth, they are in suspended animation and all the information they need to live and to fulfill the purpose they have been created for is implanted in their minds. When they become adults they are defrosted and start to carry out their task. As they have never had an actual life they have never learned to feel. They seem inhuman and unfeeling. The song features a clone called \u201C905\u201D. Like all the other clones he has been created to serve a specific purpose. Different to the other clones, he realizes that something about his existence as a clone is wrong. He does not know what is missing exactly but unconsciously he starts having feelings like a real human, as he starts hoping for a better future for him and the other clones. He wants to change things but he does not know how to do it, so he just carries on with his tasks but he knows that at least when he dies he will be free."@en ;

Co-written and produced by RedOne and inspired by her \"Fear of Men Monster\", the lyrics portray Gaga bidding farewell to her lovers. Musically, it is composed as a mid-tempo synthpop song. Contemporary critics predominantly gave \"Alejandro\" positive reviews and noted that it takes influence from the pop acts ABBA, Ace of Base and Madonna. The song charted in the United Kingdom and Hungary due to digital sales following the album's release. Upon release, \"Alejandro\" charted again in the United Kingdom as well as in Australia, Canada, New Zealand, Sweden, and the United States while topping the Finnish, Polish, Russian, Bulgarian, and Romanian charts. \"Alejandro\" became Gaga's seventh successive single to reach the top-ten of the US Billboard Hot 100. The accompanying music video was directed by fashion photographer Steven Klein and inspired by Gaga's love for her gay friends and admiration of gay love. Within the video, Gaga dances with a group of soldiers in a cabaret, interspersed with scenes of Gaga as a nun swallowing a rosary and near-naked men holding machine guns. The music video was controversial and received mixed reviews. Critics complimented its idea and dark nature while the Catholic League criticized Gaga for alleged blasphemy, despite Klein dismissing the idea and claiming that the scene in question (the swallowing of Rosary beads) was Gaga's \"desire to take in the Holy\". Gaga performed the song on the ninth season of American Idol and has performed it on all dates of The Monster Ball Tour. The song was also included on her 2012\u201313 tour The Born This Way Ball, as well as on her 2014 tour, ArtRave: The Artpop Ball."@en ;

It is the title track from her twenty-second studio album of the same name (1998), and was released as the lead single from the album on October 19, 1998 by Warner Bros. Records. It was written by Brian Higgins, Stuart McLennen, Paul Barry, Steven Torch, Matthew Gray, Timothy Powell, Jeff Lynne, and Cher and produced by Mark Taylor and Brian Rawling. A considerable departure from Cher's work at the time, \"Believe\" abandoned the singer's then pop rock-based repertoire in favor being more club-friendly, in order to engage a younger audience. \"Believe\" is an upbeat dance-pop song. The song is the first commercial recording to feature the audio processor software Auto-Tune as a vocal effect, used to produce the prominent altered effect on Cher's vocals. This technique would eventually become known as the \"Cher effect\". Lyrically, the song is about the personal empowerment and self-sufficiency after a painful break-up. Critically, \"Believe\" has been met with appreciation ever since its release; reviewers have praised its production, catchiness and club-friendly nature, and listed it as one of the singer's career highlights. The song was also nominated for two Grammy Awards; for Record of the Year and Best Dance Recording, winning the latter. Commercially, the song attained immense global success, reaching number one in almost every country it charted, including Australia, Canada, Ireland, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, Spain, France, Germany, Italy and the United States. It earned Cher a place in the Guinness Book of World Records as the oldest female solo artist to top the Billboard Hot 100 chart. It also became the highest-selling single by a solo female artist in the United Kingdom. \"Believe\" remains one of the best-selling singles of all time with sales of over 11 million copies worldwide. The music video for \"Believe\", directed by Nigel Dick, showed Cher in a nightclub performing the song in two different sequences: one in which she is seen performing the song on stage and the other as a supernatural being locked in a cage. Cher has performed the song in a number of live appearances, including in three of her concert tours, most recently the Dressed to Kill Tour in 2014. It has been covered by a number of artists, and has been featured in several elements of popular culture. Scholars and academics noted the way in which Cher was able to re-invent herself and remain fresh and contemporary amidst the more teen pop-based music of the period. They also credited \"Believe\" as the song which restored the singer's popularity and cemented her position as a pop culture icon."@en ;

The song served as the album's second single on July 9, 2012 through Arista Nashville. Written by Chris Tompkins and Josh Kear, who previously wrote Underwood's single \"Before He Cheats\" (2007), \"Blown Away\" is a country pop song with lyrics addressing the story of a daughter locking herself in a storm cellar while her alcoholic father is passed out on the couch in the path of a tornado. Producer Mark Bright drew inspiration from 1980s music. Upon its release, \"Blown Away\" was met with positive reviews from music critics, who considered it to be the musical highlight of the album. The song's content and production received particular praise, as critics felt it confirmed the album's darker mood which Underwood had mentioned prior to its release. Commercially, \"Blown Away\" was successful. In the United States, it became her 13th number one hit on the Billboard Country Airplay chart, and also reached number 20 on the Hot 100. It also charted in Canada and the United Kingdom. It won several awards, including two Grammy Awards, for Best Country Song and Best Country Solo Performance. The accompanying music video was directed by Randee St Nicholas. Underwood said that when she heard first the song, she already had ideas of a possible video for it. She wanted it to be a dark Wizard of Oz in 2012. It earned her an award for Video of the Year at the 2013 CMT Music Awards. The video was nominated for Music Video of the Year at the 2013 Country Music Association Awards. Underwood has performed \"Blown Away\" in a number of live appearances, including at the 2012 Billboard Music Awards, the 55th Annual Grammy Awards, and two years in a row at the Country Music Association Awards. It was also performed as the encore of the Blown Away Tour (2012\u201313)."@en ;

The song describes a wealthy, misogynist student named Bobby Brown, \"the cutest boy in town\", whose life is the archetypical American Dream until a traumatic sexual encounter with \"Freddie\", a lesbian involved in the women's liberation movement, leaves him questioning his sexuality. Bobby transforms into a leisure suit-wearing closeted homosexual working in radio promotions; by the end of the song, he and \"a friend\" (later implied to be his boss, as he will \"do anything to get ahead\") have become self-described \"sexual spastic(s)\" involved in golden showers and S&M, for which he thanks his \"friend\", Freddie. This song was more successful in Europe than America (the song's pervasive sexual content made it unfit for broadcast on U.S. radio) and this is why it is only featured on the vinyl and European CD version of Zappa's best of compilation, Strictly Commercial."@en ;

The song became one of Cooke's most successful singles, peaking at number two on both the Billboard Hot 100 and the Hot R&B Sides chart; it also charted at number seven on the UK Singles Chart. This was Cooke's second-biggest American hit, his first single for RCA Victor after leaving Keen Records earlier in 1959, and was also his first top 10 hit since \"You Send Me\" from 1957, and his second-biggest Pop single. The song was inspired after a chance meeting with an actual chain-gang of prisoners on a highway, seen while Sam was on tour. According to legend, Cooke and his brother Charles felt sorry for the men and gave them several cartons of cigarettes. Cooke was reportedly unsatisfied with the initial recording sessions of this song at RCA Studios in New York in January 1960, and came back three months later to redo some of the vocals to get the effect he wanted. Five months later, Ty Hunter & The Voice Masters tried an Answer Song, \"Free\", but it missed making the Top 100. The songwriting credits are sometimes erroneously attributed to Sol Quasha & Herb Yakus, who wrote a different song with the same title that was recorded by Bobby Scott and made the Top 20 in 1956."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"City of Angels\" is a song by American rock band Thirty Seconds to Mars, featured on their fourth studio album Love, Lust, Faith and Dreams (2013). Written by lead vocalist Jared Leto, who also produced the song with Steve Lillywhite, \"City of Angels\" was inspired by Leto's experience of living in Los Angeles with his family and was influenced by the city's culture. Imbued with elements of arena rock as well as music from the 1980s, the track was cited as an example of the album's variety and experimentation. \"City of Angels\" was released as a promotional single on July 30, 2013, in the United States, and was serviced to mainstream radio in Europe on October 25, 2013. A piano version of the song was digitally released in July 2014. \"City of Angels\" received general acclaim from music critics, who commended the composition, the lyrics, and Leto's vocal performance. Following the release of Love, Lust, Faith and Dreams, the track appeared in the lower regions of the UK Rock Chart. When released as a single, \"City of Angels\" re-entered the chart reaching number 21, peaked at number eight on the Alternative Songs in the US, and experienced moderate success in some international markets due to digital sales from the album. Jared Leto directed the music video for the song, which features several personalities joining the three members of Thirty Seconds to Mars in sharing their visions about Los Angeles. The video was favorably reviewed by critics, who complimented the simplicity and cohesion with the song's message. It received the Loudwire Music Award for Best Rock Video and was nominated for Best Cinematography at the 2014 MTV Video Music Awards. Thirty Seconds to Mars performed a piano rendition of the song at the 2014 iHeartRadio Music Awards. \"City of Angels\" was included in the setlist of the band's Love, Lust, Faith and Dreams Tour and subsequent Carnivores Tour."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"Cool\" is a song by American singer and songwriter Gwen Stefani from her debut solo studio album, Love. Angel. Music. Baby. (2004). Written by Stefani and Dallas Austin, the song was released on July 5, 2005 as the album's fourth single. It was written by Austin basing the song on No Doubt's \"Simple Kind of Life\", but he did not finish it. He then asked for help from Stefani, and they finished the song in 15 minutes. The single's musical style and production were inspired by synthpop and new wave arrangements from the 1980s, and its lyrics chronicle a relationship in which two lovers have separated, but remain \"cool\" with each other as good friends. The song received generally positive reviews from music critics, being compared to Cyndi Lauper and Madonna songs from the 1980s. The media have drawn parallels between the song's lyrical content and the romantic relationship that Stefani had with Tony Kanal, a fellow group member of No Doubt. The song was moderately successful on the charts, reaching the top 10 in Australia, the Czech Republic, and New Zealand, as well as the top 20 in Denmark, Ireland, Norway, the United Kingdom, and the United States. The accompanying music video was filmed by British director Sophie Muller in Lake Como, Italy. It features many flashbacks to when Stefani and her former boyfriend were dating, and currently, both are fine with their friendship. The song was included on the setlist for Stefani's debut tour Harajuku Lovers Tour and the tour's video album, as well as in the 2010 drama film Somewhere."@en ;

It was written by Furtado, Tim \"Timbaland\" Mosley and Nate \"Danja\" Hills, and produced by the former pair and Jim Beanz. The song features a prominent influence of 1980s dance-pop music and sexually suggestive lyrics, in which the song's protagonist asks a lover to satisfy her sexually. Alongside a remix featuring American rapper Missy Elliott, the song was released as the fifth single from the album in North America in July 2007. The single received mixed reviews from critics, with many criticizing the sexually suggestive lyrics. Commercially, \"Do It\" reached the top twenty in Canada and was a number-one club hit in the United States, where it became Furtado's lowest peaking single on the Billboard Hot 100; it reached higher positions on charts on mainland Europe. The music video for \"Do It\" was directed by Aaron A. (the documentarian on Furtado's Get Loose Tour), and co-directed by Furtado. The filming had taken place on location in Detroit. The video was premiered on MuchMusic on 13 July 2007, and on MTV's Total Request Live on 1 August 2007. In January 2007, it was revealed that Timbaland plagiarized the synth line in \"Do It\" from an earlier track by Finnish demoscener Janne Suni and Glenn Rune Gallefoss."@en ;

As the song progresses, the instrumentation and vocals become more hectic, ultimately ending as a full-blown dancefloor anthem. \"Drama!\" is known for its mob-shouted \"Guilty!\" exclamation throughout and Bell's intricate, multi-layered background vocals. Lyrically the song addresses a person who could be considered[by whom?] a drama queen, experiencing \"one psychological drama after another\" about everyday struggles that are universal and are easily dealt with by most people. Lines such as \"your shame is never-ending!\" are directed at the subject of the song. The mob's vocals were added to by The Jesus and Mary Chain, who happened to be recording in the studio next door. Released prior to Wild!, \"Drama!\" continued Erasure's winning streak on the UK singles chart, peaking at number four.

The success of \"Easy\" paved the way for similar Lionel Richie-composed hit ballads such as \"Three Times a Lady\" and \"Still\" and also for Richie's later solo hits. Richie wrote \"Easy\" with the intention of it becoming another crossover hit for the group, given the success of a previous single, \"Just to Be Close to You\", which spent 2 weeks at #1 on the Billboard R&B chart (known as the Hot Soul Singles chart at that time) and peaked at #7 on the Billboard Hot 100 pop charts in 1976. The song is noted for a feedback noise, with an echo, that is heard in the bridge of the song. Also, an electric guitar solo dominates the instrumental portion of the song. In addition, the other Commodores are heard singing wordless harmonies during the chorus of the song. Strings and Brass are also featured as well. The edited version receives the most airplay.

	dbo:abstract	"\"Electricity\" is the 1979 debut single of the new wave and synthpop group Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark, featured on their eponymous debut album the following year. Inspired by Kraftwerk's \"Radioactivity\", the song addresses society's wasteful usage of energy sources. Frontman Andy McCluskey shares lead vocals with Paul Humphreys, who ordinarily functions as keyboard player and backing vocalist. As with single \"Messages\", from the same album, the band embraced the concept of machines singing the song's chorus. It was on the strength of \"Electricity\" that the band were offered a recording contract with Dindisc. Three attempts at scoring a hit achieved the peak of no. 99 in 1979. However, NME named \"Electricity\" as one of the best singles of the year, placing it on the magazine's end-of-year list for 1979. The song is consistently featured on OMD compilations. In 2012, \"Electricity\" peaked at no. 126 in the French charts. Vince Clarke of Erasure (and formerly chief songwriter of Depeche Mode, Yazoo and The Assembly) has cited \"Electricity\" as his primary inspiration to pursue a career in electronic music, while BBC Radio's Steve Lamacq has named it as the track that made him want to become a DJ. AllMusic critic Ned Raggett described the song as \"pure zeitgeist, a celebration of synth pop's incipient reign with fast beats and even faster singing\"; colleague Dave Thompson called it a \"perfect electro-pop number\"."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"Happiness\" is the debut single by American recording artist Alexis Jordan. It is the lead single from her self-titled debut studio album, released in the United States on September 7, 2010. The upbeat dance-pop and house rhythm behind the track was heavily sampled from electronic artist Deadmau5's \"Brazil (2nd Edit)\" (released two years prior to \"Happiness\"). The lyrics were written by Autumn Rowe, Petr Brdi\u010Dko, and the track was re-edited for the lyrics by StarGate. \"Happiness\" was generally well received by many critics, with some complimenting Jordan's vocal abilities. In the United States, the song topped the Hot Dance Club Songs chart, giving Jordan her first number one on the chart. It has also charted in the top five in countries such as the United Kingdom and Australia. An accompanying music video, directed by Aggressive sees Jordan being torn apart from her love interest. It was noted for its similarities to Kylie Minogue's \"Can't Get You Out of My Head\"."@en ;

The song was written by Queen guitarist Brian May, who intended to record it for his then-upcoming solo album Back to the Light (1992), but when he heard Queen lead singer Freddie Mercury sing the track, he allowed it to become a Queen song. The song was the first single to be released in the United States under their contract with Hollywood Records on 14 January 1991, though it was not released in the United Kingdom for another four months (the first single in the United Kingdom was \"Innuendo\", which Hollywood eventually released in the US as a promotional single for radio stations). The song charted on the Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks chart in the United States at #3. The line \"And you're rushin' headlong\" from the chorus is somewhat lifted from the second verse of \"Breakthru\", a single from Queen's previous album The Miracle, which contains the lyrics \"I wanna rush headlong into this ecstasy\".

	dbo:abstract	"\"Heartache Tonight\" is a song written by Don Henley, Glenn Frey, Bob Seger and J. D. Souther, and recorded by the Eagles.

Although it remained in the top position for only one week, the single sold 1 million copies. It was the Eagles' final chart-topping song on the Hot 100. The recording also received a Grammy Award for Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal. The song originated from an electric jam session between Glenn Frey and J. D. Souther who would visit Frey's home in Los Angeles whenever he was in town on tour. Frey and Souther wrote the first verse while listening to Sam Cooke songs. In the heat of jamming, Frey called Seger on the phone and sang him the verse. Seger then blurted out the chorus. According to Frey, \"J.D. [Souther], Don and I finished that song up. No heavy lyrics-the song is more of a romp-and that's what it was intended to be.\" The song was covered by country music singer John Anderson on the tribute album Common Thread: The Songs of the Eagles and was also covered by Michael Bubl\u00E9 on his album Crazy Love."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"High Hopes\" is the eleventh and final track from the 1994 Pink Floyd album The Division Bell, composed by David Gilmour with lyrics by Gilmour and Polly Samson. Its lyrics speak of the things one may have gained and lost in life, written from Gilmour's autobiographic perspective. Gilmour has said that the song is more about his early days, and leaving his hometown behind, than about the seeds of division supposedly planted in Pink Floyd's early days. Douglas Adams, a friend of Gilmour, chose the album title from one verse in this song. Live versions are featured on Pulse, Remember That Night and Live in Gda\u0144sk. On Echoes: The Best of Pink Floyd, a somewhat shortened version of the song segues into Syd Barrett's \"Bike\". The segue is accomplished by cutting from the church bell at the end of \"High Hopes\" to a new bicycle bell sound effect before \"Bike\" begins. A 7-inch vinyl version of the single was released on a transparent record. The final couplet from the song (\"The endless river/Forever and ever\") recalls a line from the band's second single, \"See Emily Play\", from 1967, (\"Float on a river/Forever and ever\") and inspired the name of their final studio album, The Endless River, released in 2014."@en ;

The song was written by vocalist and guitarist Jimi Hendrix and later appeared on the international version of the compilation Smash Hits, released in April 1968. The song was described, in the book Jimi Hendrix: Electric Gypsy, as \"a joyful autobiographical stomp,\" explaining it as being a story of the pursuit of the American Dream. Matthew Greenwald of Allmusic also talks about the song as autobiographical, claiming that \"It's easy to see that Hendrix was writing about himself here, and his life as a musician on the road in the R&B/soul \"Chitlin' Circuit,\" and forming his own unique vision and style.\" Musically, \"Highway Chile\" has been described as \"A funky shuffle [...] a great place for Hendrix's mid-tempo, R&B riffing, based on a blues pattern.\" The song was released, both on \"The Wind Cries Mary\" and Smash Hits, in mono; a re-processed stereo version was released on War Heroes, it was made available in stereo for the first time when released on the box set The Jimi Hendrix Experience in September 2000.

	dbo:abstract	"\"I Believe in You (Je crois en toi)\" is a duet between Celine Dion and Il Divo, released as the third and last single from Dion's On ne change pas album, and first and only from Il Divo's Ancora. At first, on January 23, 2006 \"I Believe in You\" was released as a radio single in the United States. The commercial single was issued May 1, 2006 in France and Switzerland. It was also released as a radio single in Canada, in May 2006. Luc Plamondon, with whom Dion worked in 1991 on her Dion chante Plamondon album, wrote French lyrics for the song. There was no music video made for the song. Dion and Il Divo promoted \"I Believe in You\" in various French television shows, performing it in late 2005. The single peaked at number 30 in France and number 35 in Switzerland. In the US, it reached number 31 on the US Hot Adult Contemporary Tracks. Surprisingly, nearly 3 years after its release the song peaked at number 8 on the Portuguese Singles Chart according to Billboard magazine. \"I Believe in You\" was featured on the official 2006 FIFA World Cup album, called Voices from the FIFA World Cup, which was released on May 20, 2006. There are two released versions of the song, the version released on Dion's On ne change pas album, and the other on Il Divo's album. The difference is that \"Someday I'll find you\" is sung by a different member of Il Divo on each album. On Dion's album, the line is sung by Swiss tenor Urs Buhler, and on Il Divo's album it is sung by Spanish baritone Carlos Mar\u00EDn. This is due to them swapping lines, where the other line swapped is part of the harmony in Dion's verse (the second verse). A third version performed entirely in English (Dion's verse included) was also recorded, but never released. Il Divo performed this version in their concerts with tenor David Miller singing Dion's parts. Il Divo are not the first opera singers who have performed and recorded with Dion. She had previously collaborated with Luciano Pavarotti on \"I Hate You Then I Love You\" and Andrea Bocelli on \"The Prayer.\" The latter has been also performed by Dion and Josh Groban."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"I Believe in You and Me\" is a ballad written by Sandy Linzer and David Wolfert. The song was first recorded and released by the R&B group The Four Tops in 1983. The song was written by Linzer and Wolfert in 1982, and the Four Tops released it as a single in 1983 (although the song is, in essence, a solo recording by lead vocalist Levi Stubbs). While it failed to crack the US Top 40, it became a moderate hit for the group on the U.S. R&B chart, peaking at #40 on the Hot Black Singles chart in early 1983. In 1996, R&B/pop singer Whitney Houston recorded a very successful cover of the song for her film The Preacher's Wife and released it as a single. Following its release, the song became a top five pop and R&B hit in the U.S., also peaking on music charts worldwide and is most popularly known as a Whitney Houston song. Despite the bigger success of the Whitney Houston version, however, the song's co-composer David Wolfert, stated in a 2001 interview that young songwriters, referring to the song, told him: \"Oh, you wrote that Whitney song.\" He claimed, \"I say, 'That's not really a Whitney song,' and play them the (Four Tops) original. Their mouths drop open. No one is going to sing that song like Levi-ever.\""@en ;

The single was released in 1994 as the album's fifth and final single in the United States with both songs as double-sided songs. \"I Belong to You\" was written by Vassal Benford and Ronald Spearman and produced by Benford. While there was no music video for \"I Belong to You\", the song garnered Braxton a nomination for Best Female R&B Vocal Performance at the 1996 Grammy Awards. \"How Many Ways\" was co-written by Braxton herself and sampled the song \"God Make Me Funky\" by The Headhunters featuring Pointer Sisters. The protagonist of the composition, co-written by Braxton herself, declares there are many ways in which she loves her man. The music video for \"How Many Ways\" features Braxton and Shemar Moore riding in a car, frolicking in a playground, and on a veranda. A remix produced by R.

The ballad, produced by Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis, received very little recognition until American pop singer-songwriter Christina Aguilera recorded it for her self-titled debut album. Aguilera, who worked with Warren in another song for her debut album, felt connected to the song after relating its lyrics to her relationship with her mother, and was encouraged by Warren to record the track. Aguilera's version received mixed reviews from music critics, with some praising her vocal delivery, while others went on to criticize the ballad for being too clich\u00E9d. Nevertheless, the song became a huge success in the United States, peaking at number three on the US Billboard Hot 100 and entered the charts of multiple countries across the world. In 2008, \"I Turn To You\" was covered by Nina Girado, a Filipino pop/R&B singer, for her album Nina Sings the Hits of Diane Warren.

The song was written and produced by Jewel and Lester Mendez. Following the club success of \"Serve the Ego\", Jewel moved to a more pop-oriented sound with the release of \"Intuition\". The song, which strays from her usual folk style with simple acoustic guitar instrumentation, starts off with a French accordion and then experiments with dance-oriented beats with subtle urban influences, using synthesizers. The song achieved moderate success in the United States, reaching number 20 on the Billboard Hot 100. However, a number of Jewel's fans criticized her for abandoning her traditional folk style in exchange for a new pop sound. After the song was licensed to promote Schick Intuition razors, Jewel was accused of \"writing a song that tells us all to resist the total marketing mentality... and then licensing that song to a consumer products company for a huge sales campaign.\" Despite the switch of sound style, the song is lyrically similar to her previous work. It has a number of references to popular culture, including mentioning celebrities such as pop star Jennifer Lopez, model Kate Moss, actor Charlie Sheen, magazines, film culture, and commercialism."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"Is This the Way to Amarillo\" is a song written by Neil Sedaka and Howard Greenfield, referring to Amarillo, Texas. It is about a man traveling to Amarillo to find his girlfriend. The reason that Amarillo was chosen for the song was because it was the only place name that Sedaka could think of that rhymed with \"willow\" and \"pillow\". The song was originally to be titled, \"Is This the Way to Pensacola\" referring to Pensacola, Florida, but Sedaka felt that Amarillo worked better than Pensacola. Written by two Americans about a United States city, the song was first released in Europe, where it has become much more famous than it has ever been in the composers' native country. The song was recorded by Tony Christie and released in the UK in November 1971, initially reaching number 18 in the UK Singles Chart. However, it was a substantially bigger hit at that time across Continental Europe, notably in Germany and Spain, where it made number one. Following its re-issue in 2005, promoted with a video featuring Peter Kay, the song gained even greater prominence. In 2006, the song was played at the World Cup Final in Berlin and was also played by the Central Band of the Royal British Legion on Centre Court at Wimbledon before the start of the Men's Singles final.[citation needed]"@en ;

The song, produced by Jacknife Lee, is one of the three new songs, and the lead single from the compilation Up to Now. The lyrics were written by Gary Lightbody and the music was composed by Snow Patrol. \"Just Say Yes\" has its origins as a song written for pop singer Gwen Stefani, who rejected it. Nicole Scherzinger of the Pussycat Dolls was then given permission by Lightbody to record it for her solo debut album, which was later shelved. Snow Patrol later took the song back and recorded it for their compilation album Up to Now. The song, having an electronic, synthpop sound, marks a distinct change in the Snow Patrol's sound. Writer Gary Lightbody has called it their most adventurous single to date. The video, directed by Blue Leach, features light effects and projection to bring a trippy, dreamy feel. The song was used in a music campaign for Nokia in the Netherlands. It was also used in the trailer for the 2010 film Leap Year. The city of Derry, Northern Ireland was given permission to use the song in their successful bid to be crowned UK City of Culture 2013. It performed well commercially, reaching the top 10 on the singles chart in countries like Belgium, Denmark and Ireland and topped the charts in the Netherlands. However, the critical reaction was mixed. Reviews generally praised the song for encompassing the band's past and new sound.

Written by lead vocalist Jared Leto across the United States and South Africa, the track was produced by Flood, Steve Lillywhite and Thirty Seconds to Mars. According to Leto, the lyrics of \"Kings and Queens\" explore the triumphant feeling of human possibilities. The melody of the song contains several qualities similar to that of 1980s adult contemporary musical works and is imbued with elements of progressive rock. The song was released as the lead single from This Is War on October 13, 2009. \"Kings and Queens\" received critical acclaim, with critics deeming it as an album highlight. Much of the praise went to the song's lyrics and the musical production; reviewers also complimented Leto's vocals. The song became the band's second number one single on the US Alternative Songs and attained success in international markets. The accompanying music video, directed by Jared Leto, features Thirty Seconds to Mars and a group of followers on a critical mass movement through Los Angeles at night. Critics lauded the simplicity of the video, which was nominated for numerous accolades, including four awards at the 2010 MTV Video Music Awards. Thirty Seconds to Mars performed the song on The Tonight Show with Conan O'Brien feauring the Street Drum Corps, and included it on the setlist of the Into the Wild Tour.

	dbo:abstract	"\"Like a Prayer\" is a song by American singer Madonna, from her studio album of the same name. It was released by Sire Records as the lead single from the album on March 3, 1989. Written and produced by Madonna and Patrick Leonard, \"Like a Prayer\" denoted a more artistic and personal approach to songwriting for Madonna, who felt she needed to cater more to her adult audience. \"Like a Prayer\" is a pop rock song with elements of gospel music. A choir provides background vocals that heighten the song's spiritual nature, and a rock guitar keeps the music dark and mysterious. Madonna introduced liturgical words in the lyrics\u2014inspired by her Catholic upbringing\u2014but changed the context in which they were used. They have dual meanings of sexual innuendo and religion. \"Like a Prayer\" was acclaimed by critics, and was a commercial success. It was Madonna's seventh number-one single on the United States' Billboard Hot 100, and topped the singles charts in Australia, Canada, Denmark, Finland, Ireland, Italy, New Zealand, Norway, Sweden, the United Kingdom and other countries. The music video, directed by Mary Lambert, portrays Madonna as a witness to a murder of a white girl by white supremacists. While a black man is arrested for the murder, Madonna hides in a church for safety seeking strength to go forth as a witness. The clip depicts Catholic symbols such as stigmata, Ku Klux Klan-style cross burning, and a dream about kissing a black saint. After its release, the Vatican condemned the video, while family and religious groups protested its broadcast. They boycotted products by soft drink manufacturer Pepsi, which used the song for a commercial. Madonna's contract with Pepsi was then canceled, although she was allowed to retain her initial fee. The song has been featured on four of Madonna's concert tours, most recently the Rebel Heart Tour in 2015. \"Like a Prayer\" has been covered by many artists. The song is noted for the mayhem surrounding the music video, and the different interpretations of its content, leading to discussions among music and film scholars. Alongside its respective album, \"Like a Prayer\" has been considered a turning point in Madonna's career, as she began to be viewed as an efficient businesswoman\u2014someone who knew how to sell a concept."@en ;

Released on August 30, 2012, it is the fourth single off the album Gravity, which was released on September 4, 2012. The song's lyrics focus on religion, spirituality, and the role of grandmothers in developing faith and stability. It features a confession by Big K.R.I.T in which he expresses frustration with Christian hypocrisy. The song has been well received by critics and is considered one of the best songs off the album, with the lush instrumental production by DJ Khalil and the vocals by Ashthon Jones attracting particular praise. Stylistically, \"Mayday\" is described as having both a very \"raw\" and \"organic\" sound and R&B flow, with \"chaotic\" and \"funky\" production."@en ;

The music video, which appeared as part of Yankovic's film UHF, is a parody of the \"Money for Nothing\" music video. The song features Dire Straits members Mark Knopfler on guitar and Guy Fletcher on synthesizer, Knopfler's one condition for allowing the parody. Jim West, Yankovic's own guitarist, had then practiced the song for weeks, and, as a result of that and of Knopfler having played it for a couple of years and being much more relaxed with it, West's version sounded more like the original version. Yankovic joked that when Knopfler told him that he had to play lead guitar on the recording, Yankovic replied \"umm...okay if you HAVE to.\" The song is credited to Mark Knopfler and Sting (writers of the original \"Money for Nothing\") and Paul Henning (writer of \"The Ballad of Jed Clampett\")."@en ;

When only her face is seen, she is given different make-up and glasses, and also make-up which seems to imply injury. She is seen in one scene to walk from different places into the same room holding a sign above her head, which shows the lyrics.

It was originally released on 25 March 1996 and peaked at #56 in the UK charts, but it was later re-released on 21 October that year, this time peaking at #11. In Australia, \"Neighbourhood\" entered the ARIA top 100 singles chart on 9 February 1997 at #90, its peak. \"Neighbourhood\" peaked at #22 in New Zealand in March 1997. The lyrics to \"Neighbourhood\" were partially inspired by frontman Tommy Scott's upbringing in the Liverpool housing estate Cantril Farm (which has since been reestablished as Stockbridge Village), yet it stays true to the band's twisted sense of humour by depicting a variety of somewhat warped personalities including a man who thinks he's Saddam Hussein, Mr Miller, a \"local vicar and a serial killer,\" a \"big butch queen\" who's \"bigger than Tyson and twice as mean,\" and others. The lyrical style has eighties dub reggae & sound system deejay influences.. In September 2004, \"Neighbourhood\" was used by the BBC in an ident for their short-lived series Fat Nation. The line \"Who lives in a house like this?\" is thought to be a reference to Through the Keyhole, another BBC programme.

	dbo:abstract	"\"New Day\" is a song by American recording artist Alicia Keys from her fifth studio album Girl on Fire (2012). Produced by Swizz Beatz and Dr. Dre, the song showcases a musical departure from the previous singles by the singer, with a more upbeat sound led by drums and percussion, as opposed to her classical R&B sound. On the song, Keys sings about \"touching the sky and not letting chances go to waste\". It received praise from music critics, who complimented the new musical direction, as well as criticizing the downgrade of Keys' \"powerhouse voice\" in favor of percussion. Rapper 50 Cent has a version of the song with one verse by Dr. Dre and the hook by Alicia Keys, also called \"New Day\". It was released as the second international single from the album and was officially sent to French radio stations on February 21, 2013."@en ;

The night of its release the band performed at Irving Plaza in New York City and sold the single at the door. \"Night of the Living Dead\" is titled after the 1968 horror film of the same name, and the song's lyrics address the zombie plot of the film: \"You think you're a zombie, you think it's a scene/from some monster magazine/Open your eyes too late/This ain't no fantasy boy\". \"Where Eagles Dare\" shares its title with a 1968 World War II spy film. \"Rat Fink\" is a cover of a song by Allan Sherman from his 1963 album My Son, the Nut, which itself is a parody of \"Rag Mop\". It was the only cover song that the Misfits recorded during their early era, though it was credited on the single itself, and on later releases, to Danzig."@en ;

The song was originally recorded by singer Dionne Warwick for inclusion on her album Friends. It is unclear why the song was not included on the final tracklist. The song was based on a relationship that had reached its end with both parties going their separate ways in a melancholy state with the occasional option of coming back together again one day. It was often stated the two performers were in separate cities when they recorded their individual parts which were then \"married\" during mixing. This was reflected in the music video produced to promote the song, which depicted LaBelle and McDonald performing the song simultaneously on different coasts. The singers were shown on separate sides of a split screen, each singing the song while walking through apartments which had identical layouts but different decor and furniture. The views from their respective porches, where they finished the song, made clear their separation by the continent."@en ;

It was first recorded in a ska style by Marley's original group, The Wailers in 1965 and was released as a single. This version was later included on their first singles compilation The Wailing Wailers in 1966. It was rerecorded as part of the 1970 medley All In One, which contained reggae reworkings of their early ska songs. This was released as a single and is also included on the compilation African Herbsman under the name \"All in One\". The version on Exodus was not released as a single until 9 April 1984, promoting the forthcoming greatest hits album Legend. However, the single became one of his biggest hits and has been included on many of Marley and the Wailers subsequent compilation albums. The song contains an interpretation of The Impressions' song \"People Get Ready\" written by Curtis Mayfield. The original recording of the song does not credit Mayfield's song and is simply titled \"One Love\" - this because copyright law was not enforced for Jamaican recordings at this time. When the famous version was recorded for Island in 1977 it was titled \"One Love/People Get Ready\" and credited Mayfield, as Island wanted to avoid copyright problems. and it gives co-authorship credits to both Marley and Mayfield. The original song was published in the key of Bb major, but it has now been transposed so it is in the key of C major."@en ;

According to Nas, the title of the song originates from Jamaican singer-songwriter and musician Bob Marley's song of the same name. \"One Love\" is composed as a series of telephone calls by Nas to his incarcerated friends, describing events that have occurred prior to and after the receivers' imprisonment. \"One Love\" contains samples of the Heath Brothers' \"Smilin' Billy Suite Part II\" (1975) and Parliament's \"Come In Out the Rain\" (1970). In the song's first verse, Nas references fellow Queensbridge emcee Cormega, whose rapping career had been put on hold due to his incarceration during the early 1990s. In 2008, VH1 named \"One Love\" the forty-eighth greatest hip hop song."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"One Love\" is a single released by the British electronic act The Prodigy on 4 October 1993. It was the first single from the album Music For the Jilted Generation, and their sixth single. The ring on the cover is made by 'Stussy' and is solid silver (925). Liam Howlett first released the songs \"One Love\" and \"One Love\" (Jonny L Remix) as two 12\" white labels, called \"Earthbound 1\" and \"Earthbound 2\" respectively, in response to growing criticism from the music community about The Prodigy having sold themselves out and become purely commercial. Underground DJs apparently praised the white labels as some of the best of the year, but when it was revealed that Howlett had produced the songs, the DJs shunned the songs.[citation needed] With this act, Howlett had shown that The Prodigy was still capable of making pioneering dance music praised by the underground. This song in particular features rather innovative programming and loop-work in combination with sped-up tribal chants and orchestral strings. \"One Love\" was also one of the first Prodigy singles to not receive a US release. The version that appeared on The Prodigy's second studio album Music for the Jilted Generation was the shorter edit version due to the band having to trim some running time off the album to allow it to fit on the master CD. The music video was created by Hyperbolic Systems and featured computer generated graphics with occasional images of the band members dancing along tribal figures. In 1995, \"One Love\" (along with Voodoo People) was included in the soundtrack for the movie Hackers, starring Angelina Jolie."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"One Love\" is a non-album single by The Stone Roses. The single was released in the UK, U.S., Australia, Brazil, Germany, Japan, Spain, and France, peaking at #4 in the Roses' home country of the UK, their highest charting single up until that time. One Love has appeared on the compilation albums Turns into Stone, The Complete Stone Roses and The Very Best of The Stone Roses. The song has a decidedly mixed reputation among Roses fans, with some denouncing it for borrowing too much from the success of \"Fools Gold\". Nevertheless, the song contains vivid biblical references prevalent throughout their catalogue. The original artwork for the single was said to have formed a swastika. It was later used for The Complete Stone Roses. John Squire ripped it up and used the torn pieces for the cover. The band set fire to the ripped up artwork in the video for \"One Love\". The song was used in an episode of the popular British television series Shameless. In the scene in which the song appears, Frank Gallagher is seen dancing in the pub with his shirt over his head as he is drunk and high on ecstasy. It is believed that John Squire played a Custom Fender Jaguar guitar with a variety of flanging and wahwah effect pedals to create the song's distinctive sound. The song is referenced in a banner that hangs from the Stretford End tier two at Manchester United's FC's ground, Old Trafford. The banner says \"One Love \u2013 Stretford End \u2013 MUFC\". The music video featured The Stone Roses performing outdoors, with fires blazing in the background. Ian Brown on \"One Love\": \"The chorus wasn't strong enough. We tried for an anthem. We wanted to cover all bases and ended up covering none.\""@en ;

The song is available for listening via online music services such as AOL and MySpace, courtesy of RCA Records. McPhee has since stated that this was not \"[her] favorite song\". In the song, McPhee sings over a sultry beat driven by acoustic guitars about letting go of the person one loves because one does not share the same feeling. The narrator complains about how their lover cheats on them, and is betraying their trust. The song is somewhat tongue-in-cheek in that McPhee describes several qualities about her ex-boyfriend, while at the same time she seems to fixate on them, showing she is not fully over him."@en ;

Sheeran wrote the song with Snow Patrol member, Johnny McDaid, who had a piano loop from which the composition developed. After recording several versions with other producers, Sheeran eventually solicited help from Jeff Bhasker; the collaboration generated a version that Bhasker further enhanced for months. The ballad derives its music primarily from an acoustic guitar, piano and programmed drums. With visually descriptive lyrics, it discusses a long-distance relationship inspired by Sheeran's own experience of being away from his then-girlfriend while he was on tour. The song received generally positive commentary from critics who noted the lyrics and Sheeran's use of imagery. \"Photograph\" served as the fifth and final single from the album. It reached the top five on the main singles charts in more than five countries. In the US, where it peaked at No. 10, \"Photograph\" became the third single from the album to have reached within the top ten. In the UK, it reached No. 15 and has since been certified platinum for sales of 600,000 units. The single has also been certified double platinum in Australia and Canada, and platinum in New Zealand and Italy. The single's release on 11 May 2015 followed the premiere of the music video on 9 May 2015. The video is a montage of real home footage of Sheeran's infancy, childhood and adolescence, providing insight on his private early life such as his inclination to playing music instruments and fondness of Lego. The video was nominated for Best Video at the 2016 Brit Awards. Sheeran performed the song on television shows and on his x Tour, which ran from 2014 to 2015."@en ;

It was written by Ciara, Jasper Cameron, Polow da Don and Elvis Williams and produced by Polow da Don. The remix features singer R. Kelly. The song was released as the album's official lead single on October 16, 2006, through LaFace Records. The song was selected as the first single as Ciara wanted to put out a single with a slower pace, noting that her previous releases had been up-tempo. According to Ciara, the song represents the album's theme of evolving and symbolizes her growth as a songwriter and artist. \"Promise\" is a mid-tempo R&B ballad with lyrics that describe what the protagonist wants out of love. The song received generally positive reviews from critics, who made comparisons with songs by musician Prince. Critics also observed that it was different and refreshing from Ciara's previous singles. \"Promise\" topped the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart in the United States and peaked at number 11 on the Billboard Hot 100, becoming Ciara's best-performing single sans a featured artist on both charts. It was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for shipping over one million copies. Diane Martel directed the song's accompanying music video, which features scenes of Ciara singing into a gravity-defying microphone. Ciara stated that it is just about performance as she wanted to make a distinct R&B video. The video received a BET Award nomination for Viewer's Choice in 2007."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"Respect\" is the fourth single from Joel Turner and the Modern Day Poets' self-titled debut album. The verses are performed by the Modern Day Poets (MDP), with Turner contributing the chorus, bass and beatbox backing. A piano riff was supplied by Mefi Puni and Bryan Bouro. The song is essentially a social comment on the lack of respect that exists within the hip-hop community. It also alludes to the gang wars that have claimed the lives of several American rappers, and is a warning and a plea that the Australian hip-hop scene does not follow suit. On release, the single's video caused a slight controversy, as some people criticized the use of images of murdered rapper Tupac Shakur,But what the critics didn't know, Joel Turner's cousin Chris Heiner A.K.A C4 now known as 3am in the Valley called Video Hits Host at the time (Axle Whitehead) to pull the clip off air as Joel Turner and the Modern Day Poets were unaware that the Tupac and Biggie footage was put together and organised by Mark Holden. Following the phone call to Axle Whitehead 'C4' called Label Manager Mark Holden and made serious threats towards him about the footage used, C4 talked about the clip and quoted 'Who the F*** would use images of Tupac and Biggie,they are Hiphop Legends,people don't see behind the closed curtains of the music industry, the fans and critics just saw that Joel Turner and MDP used Tupac and Biggie images in their clip, so i dont blame people for being critical at the start, but the truth is it was a snake that did it behind our back, he obviously does not know shit about Hiphop C4 laughed' and Quoted 'I would kick my own ass for doing that' why do you think i'm so pissed off, you just dont f*** with that, I hate seeing fake Tupac T-shirts exploited at a local market with his face on it' it's wrong, he didn't realise it would burn our career before it got started,what the f*** was he thinking, i'm done talking about it, all i can say is if your in the music industry be careful who you work with and keep your artist integrity dont let anyone take it away and if they try 'F*** em' stand up and smack em down' End quote. After the clip was taken down it caused the split between Joel Turner and MDP and Mark Holden's Label Dream Dealers)as MDP felt Mark Holden failed to comply with artist integrity.Axle Whitehead approved of C4's A.K.A (3am in the valley's) orders and Pulled the clip off air immediately. A second clip was released interspersed with footage of Turner and MDP from previous video shoots and the 2005 West Coast Blues and Roots Festival. In addition, ABC video show Rage censored the lyric \"When peeps knock on your door / And force you to the floor / Put a gun in your mouth / Blow your brains out all over the wall\". Shortly after the video\u2019s release, a second clip for the song emerged in which most of the original content (including Shakur\u2019s likeness) was replaced with colour scenes of the group performing the tune for the camera. \"Respect\" was released in Australia on 17 October 2005. It debuted in the top 40 of the ARIA singles chart, peaking at #29 and reaching #2 on the Queensland charts."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"Respect\" is a song written and originally released by American recording artist Otis Redding in 1965. The song became a 1967 hit and signature song for R&B singer Aretha Franklin. The music in the two versions is significantly different, and through a few minor changes in the lyrics, the stories told by the songs have a different flavor. Redding's version is a plea from a desperate man, who will give his woman anything she wants. He won't care if she does him wrong, as long as he gets his due respect, when he comes home (\"respect\" being a euphemism)[citation needed]. However, Franklin's version is a declaration from a strong, confident woman, who knows that she has everything her man wants. She never does him wrong, and demands his \"respect\".[citation needed] Franklin's version adds the \"R-E-S-P-E-C-T\" chorus and the backup singers' refrain of \"Sock it to me, sock it to me, sock it to me...\" Franklin's cover was a landmark for the feminist movement, and is often considered as one of the best songs of the R&B era, earning her two Grammy Awards in 1968 for \"Best Rhythm & Blues Recording\" and \"Best Rhythm & Blues Solo Vocal Performance, Female\", and was inducted in the Grammy Hall of Fame in 1987. In 2002, the Library of Congress honored Franklin's version by adding it to the National Recording Registry. It is number five on Rolling Stone's list of The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time. It was also included in the list of Songs of the Century, by the Recording Industry of America and the National Endowment for the Arts. Franklin included a live recording on the album Aretha in Paris (1968)."@en .

According to Brent Smith, \"when the first single, 'Save Me', hit the radio, I still hadn't written lyrics for four of the songs nor had sung four others on the album. I was in the studio working my ass off to get finished\"."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"Say Something\" is a song recorded by American producer, songwriter and rapper Timbaland, for his third studio album Shock Value II (2009). The song features vocals from Canadian rapper Drake. It was written by Mosley, Jerome Harmon, Graham, Timothy Clayton and John Maultsby. The production was helmed by Mosley under his stage-name Timbaland while Harmon served as the assistant producer, under the stage-name Jroc. The song was tailored to Drake's sound and when the rapper wrote to it, he contacted the producer about the lyrics. Despite the verses feeling more like Graham's record, Mosley gave his blessing and went the product. The song was solicited to digital retailers on November 3, 2009 in the United States as the album's second single. \"Say Something\" is an electro-rap song with a slow moving beat and feel. Lyrically, it portrays an interaction between Graham and a woman and the awkward feel to it, that is influenced by past events that occurred between them. \"Say Something\" garnered generally mixed reviews from music critics; many of them praised it as a \"radio hit\" but felt it fared worse than Drake's previous works and believed it highlighted Timbaland's weaknesses as a vocalist. Since its domestic release, the song has reached number twenty-three on the Billboard Hot 100, standing as the second highest charting single from Shock Value II in the United States. The music video for the song was directed by Paul \"Coy\" Allen features appearances from Sebastian, D.O.E., Attitude and DJ Freestyle Steve."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"Somebody to Love\" is a song performed by Canadian recording artist Justin Bieber. The song served as the second single from his album, My World 2.0. It was written by Heather B and The Stereotypes, and produced by the latter. The song was originally recorded as a demo by Bieber's mentor, R&B singer, Usher, for his sixth studio album, Raymond v. Raymond (2010). After things went stale with Usher's label, The Stereotypes were encouraged to give the song to Bieber, who recorded it, with Usher performing background vocals. The song is an upbeat dance-pop song, which also derives from R&B genre, while making use of Eurodisco influences. It impacted US mainstream and rhythmic radio on April 20, 2010. Usher re-recorded featured vocals for the official remix of the song, which was released on June 25, 2010. A variation of the track with slightly different production done by Benny Blanco, features Usher on lead vocals and Bieber as the featured artist. It is included on the follow-up release of Raymond v. Raymond, titled Versus. In Japan, the song was released dually with \"Never Say Never\" as a double A-side single. The song received positive reviews, with critics complimenting the track's dance feel, and the lyrical content. \"Somebody to Love\" became Bieber's third consecutive top ten hit in Canada, and his fourth consecutive top twenty single in the United States. It also reached the top twenty in Germany, New Zealand and Australia. The accompanying music video for the official remix, directed by Dave Meyers, was intended to rely solely on choreography, and integrate different styles of dance. It features appearances from several dance crews, such as Beat Freaks and Poreotics. According to critics, the video makes allusions to previous dance-heavy clips by Usher and Chris Brown. Bieber performed the song at a number of venues, including the 2010 MTV Video Music Awards and on the seventh series of The X Factor in the United Kingdom."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"Somebody to Love\" is a song by the British rock band Queen, written by the lead singer/pianist Freddie Mercury. It debuted on the band's 1976 album A Day at the Races and was also featured on their compilation album Greatest Hits. The song offers listeners something similar to that of Queen's earlier hit \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" with its complex harmonies and guitar solos; however instead of mimicking an English choir, the band turned to a gospel choir. It reached #2 in the UK and #13 on the Billboard Hot 100 in the US. This song made it clear to fans that \"Queen could swing as hard as it could rock, by channeling the spirit of gospel music.\" Written by Mercury at the piano, \"Somebody to Love\" is a soul-searching piece that questions God's role in a life without love. Through voice layering techniques, Queen was able to create the soulful sound of a 100-voice choir, with that of only three voices: Mercury, Brian May and Roger Taylor. John Deacon did not sing backing vocals during the recorded album. Mercury's fascination and admiration for Aretha Franklin was a major influence for the creation of this song. Queen played \"Somebody to Love\" live between 1977\u201385, and a live performance of the song is recorded on the album Queen Rock Montreal. In addition to these live performances, there has been collaboration on tributes to \"Somebody to Love\" after Mercury's death in 1991. The song was played live on 20 April 1992, during The Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert, with George Michael on lead vocals. Since its release in 1976, the song has appeared in a number of television shows, such as American Idol, The X Factor, Glee and Gossip Girl, as well as movies, including Happy Feet and Ella Enchanted. Additionally, it has been covered by many artists. Most recently, the original Queen version made an appearance in a 2016 Honda commercial for its Ridgeline pickup truck that aired during the U.S. broadcast of Super Bowl 50."@en ;

It was released by Polydor Records on 16 November 2012, as the first single from the album and the official single for Children in Need 2012 and also serves as their final official single. In February 2009, the group signed a new record deal with Fascination Records that would see the group release another three studio albums; however, they announced that they were taking a hiatus to pursue solo projects. In April 2012, bandmate Cheryl Cole revealed the girls had been in talks to regroup for the group's tenth anniversary later that year. In October 2012, a countdown was activated on Girls Aloud's official website, which would last until 19 October 2012, when \"Something New\" would be premiered on radio. However the date was brought forward to 16 October 2012 following an early online leak of the track. \"Something New\" is a dance song produced by Girls Aloud's long-time collaborator Brian Higgins. Music critics were mostly positive towards the production, and compared it to songs by David Guetta, Nicki Minaj and Lady Gaga. They also noted that the track's structure follow the group's signature style. \"Something New\" debuted and peaked at number 2 on the UK Singles Chart, becoming Girls Aloud's 16th top five hit in the country. The song also peaked inside the top five in Ireland and Scotland. The accompanying music video was directed by Ray Kay, and features a mixture of black-and-white and coloured shots of the entire group, while also showcasing each member in a separate set-up. Girls Aloud performed \"Something New\" in few programmes, such as Strictly Come Dancing and Top of the Pops, and in 2013's Ten: The Hits Tour.

It is the band's seventeenth single and the second from their seventh studio album, Seventh Son of a Seventh Son (1988). The single debuted at number six in the UK charts and quickly rose to number five. The single's B-sides are re-recordings of \"Prowler\" and \"Charlotte the Harlot\" which appear as tracks number one and seven/eight respectively on the band's debut album Iron Maiden. The title of the song is taken from Marcus Antonius's speech while addressing the crowd of Romans after Caesar's murder (Act 3, scene 2, \"The Forum\") in William Shakespeare's Julius Caesar: \"The evil that men do lives after them; The good is oft interred with their bones.\" Bruce Dickinson may sometimes repeat this before playing the song, but in reverse (as he did in Rock in Rio). However, the poetic lyrics of the song are unrelated to this. The guitar solo in \"The Evil That Men Do\" is played by Adrian Smith while the guitar solo in \"Prowler '88\" is played by Dave Murray. In \"Charlotte the Harlot '88\", the first guitar solo is played by Dave Murray followed by Adrian Smith.

During the live performances the song was followed by a lengthy improvisational jam known as \"Broken English Jam\", due to Cedric Bixler-Zavala reciting lyrics from Marianne Faithfull's song of the same name. The band did not shoot a music video for the song; instead, a fan video contest was announced, with a winner receiving a $500 Best Buy gift card and merchandise from the band. An official, 15-minute live video featuring footage from the 2011 ORLG tour was released on June 18, 2012.

	dbo:abstract	"\"The Weight\" is a song originally by the Canadian-American group The Band that was released as Capitol Records single 2269 in 1968 and on the group's debut album Music from Big Pink. Written by Band member Robbie Robertson, the song is about a visitor's experiences in a town mentioned in the lyric's first line as Nazareth. \"The Weight\" has significantly influenced American popular music, having been listed as #41 on Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Songs of All Time published in 2004. Pitchfork Media named it the 13th best song of the Sixties, and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame named it one of the 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll. PBS, which broadcast performances of the song in \"Ramble at the Ryman\" (2011), \"Austin City Limits\" (2012), and \"Quick Hits\" (2012), describes it as \"a masterpiece of Biblical allusions, enigmatic lines and iconic characters\" and notes its enduring popularity as \"an essential part of the American songbook.\" \"The Weight\" is one of The Band's best known songs though it was not a significant mainstream hit for the group in the U.S., peaking at only #63. The Band's recording fared much better in Canada and the UK \u2013 in those countries, the single was a top 40 hit, peaking at #35 in Canada and #21 in the UK in 1968. However, the song's popularity was greatly enhanced by three cover releases in 1968 and 1969 with arrangements that appealed to a diversity of music audiences. Aretha Franklin's 1969 soul music arrangement was included in her This Girl's in Love with You album, which peaked in the U.S. at #19 and #3 on the soul chart, and peaked in Canada at #12. Jackie DeShannon's 1968 pop music arrangement, debuting on the Hot 100 one week before The Band's, peaked at #55 in the U.S., #35 in Canada. A joint single rhythm and blues arrangement released by Diana Ross & the Supremes and The Temptations in 1969, hit #46 in the U.S., and #36 in Canada. The Band's and Jackie DeShannon's versions never mentioned the title. The Band's version credits Jaime Robbie Robertson, Rick Danko, Richard Manuel, Garth Hudson, Levon Helm on the record label, rather than The Band."@en ;

Based on Tristram of Lyonesse, Patrick described the writing process in a 2005 interview: \"I took a holiday down to Cornwall in October, which down there is almost mid-autumn; it's very stormy and so you get this huge shipwrecking kind of weather down there. There was no-one around, no tourists. It was my first night there and I had taken down my organ to finish off some lyrics. Then I went for a long walk and suddenly a storm came in in this very dangerous place. I came back safe and sound and dried myself off and suddenly this song \"Tristan\" came wrapping on the door. It came in two minutes. It was finished then and it was almost like a possession, like I was possessed for two minutes. And I wrote that song. I didn't really know what happened and then suddenly had this gift. It's like someone came to the door and jumped inside me, wrote a song and then ran away again.\"Lightspeed champion has made a cover of it."@en ;

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Umbrella_(song)>	rdf:type	dbo:MusicalWork ;
	dbo:abstract	"\"Umbrella\" is a song by Barbadian recording artist Rihanna from her third studio album Good Girl Gone Bad (2007). It features American rapper Jay-Z, who co-wrote the song with its producers Tricky Stewart and Kuk Harrell, with additional writing from The-Dream. The song was originally written with recording artist Britney Spears in mind, but her label rejected it. \"Umbrella\" is a hip hop and R&B song referring to a romantic and platonic relationship and the strength of that relationship. \"Umbrella\" was acclaimed by music critics, many of whom appreciated the \"ella, ella\" hook as well as the convincing vocals with which Rihanna delivered the chorus. Entertainment Weekly ranked the song number one on the 10 Best Singles of 2007, while Rolling Stone and Time listed the song at number three on the 100 Best Songs of 2007. The song has earned Rihanna several awards and nominations. In 2007, the song won two awards at the MTV Video Music Awards, when it was nominated for four. At the 2008 Grammy Awards, \"Umbrella\" also earned Rihanna and Jay-Z a Grammy Award for Best Rap/Sung Collaboration in addition to receiving nominations for Record of the Year and Song of the Year. The song is also listed on Rolling Stone's The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time at 412. The song serves as the lead single to the album, and was released worldwide on March 29, 2007 through Def Jam Recordings. \"Umbrella\" was a commercial success, topping the charts in Australia, Canada, Germany, Spain, the Republic of Ireland, Sweden, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and the United States. In the United Kingdom, where the song's chart performance generated controversy[citation needed] when the country was experiencing excessive flooding and large amounts of rain at the time, it was one of the most played songs on radio in the 2000s (decade). It managed to stay at number one on the UK Singles Chart for 10 consecutive weeks, the longest run at number one for any single of that decade, and is also one of the few songs to top the chart for at least 10 weeks. The single was one of the highest digital debuts in the United States and remained at the top of the US Billboard Hot 100 for seven consecutive weeks. The single's accompanying music video was directed by Chris Applebaum and features, among all, Rihanna's nude body covered in silver paint. The video earned Rihanna a Video of the Year at the 2007 MTV Video Music Awards and Most Watched Video on MuchMusic.com at MuchMusic Video Awards. Along with countless amateurs, \"Umbrella\" has been covered by several notable performers from a variety of musical genres, including Taylor Swift, Manic Street Preachers, Biffy Clyro, All Time Low, McFly, OneRepublic, Mike Shinoda of Linkin Park, Vanilla Sky and The Baseballs. Rihanna performed the song at the 2007 MTV Movie Awards, 2008 BRIT Awards and was the closing song of the \"Good Girl Gone Bad Tour\" (2008), the \"Last Girl on Earth\" (2010), and the \"Loud Tour\" (2011).

After a low-key independent record label pressing in the United Kingdom, where it was packaged in a very limited edition logo embossed aluminium case, \"Vow\" went on to top the alternative charts in Australia and register on the Hot 100 singles chart in the United States. The song began as a demo during sessions between band members Butch Vig, Duke Erikson and Steve Marker, and the composition finished after singer Shirley Manson joined the band. The lyrics for \"Vow\" deal with themes of revenge and retaliation, and were inspired by a newspaper article on domestic abuse. In 2007, \"Vow\" was remastered and included as the opening track on Garbage's greatest hits compilation, Absolute Garbage."@en ;

Written by the group members with Matt Rowe and Richard Stannard during the group's first professional songwriting session, it was produced by Rowe and Stannard for the group's debut album Spice, released in November 1996. The song was written and recorded very quickly; the result was considered lacklustre by their label, and was sent to be mixed by Dave Way. The group was not pleased with the result, and the recording was mixed again, this time by Mark \"Spike\" Stent. \"Wannabe\" is an uptempo dance-pop and pop-rap song that incorporates a mix of hip hop and rap. The lyrics, which address the value of female friendship over the heterosexual bond, became an iconic symbol of female empowerment and the most emblematic song of the group's Girl Power philosophy. Despite receiving mixed reviews from music critics, the song won for Best British-Written Single at the 1997 Ivor Novello Awards and for Best Single at the 1997 BRIT Awards. \"Wannabe\" was heavily promoted by the group. Its music video, directed by Johan Camitz, became a big success on the British cable network The Box, which sparked press interest in the group. Subsequently the song had intensive radio airplay across the United Kingdom, while the group performed it on television programmes and started doing interviews and photo shoots for teen magazines. Released as the group's debut single in July 1996,[clarification needed] \"Wannabe\" topped the UK Singles Chart for seven weeks and has received a double Platinum certification by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI). In January 1997 it was released in the United States, topping the Billboard Hot 100 for four weeks. It was the group's only number-one single in that country. By the end of 1996, \"Wannabe\" had topped the charts in 22 nations, and by March 1997 this number had climbed to 37. \"Wannabe\" became the best-selling single by a female group in the world, with 1,360,000 and 2,910,000 copies sold in United Kingdom (by 2015) and United States (by 2014), respectively, and over 7 million copies worldwide by the end of 1997. In 2014, it was rated as the most easily recognizable pop song of the last 60 years."@en ;

It did, however, garner comparisons to Beyonc\u00E9's 2006 single \"Irreplaceable\". The song was a commercial success as it topped the charts in New Zealand and peaked inside the top five in several countries. In the United States, \"With You\" peaked at number two on the Billboard Hot 100 and at number one on the US Pop Songs chart. The music video for \"With You\" was directed by Brown and Erik White.

The B-side of the single was another song by Bush named \"Kite\" - hence the kite imagery on the record sleeve. \"Wuthering Heights\" came 32nd in Q magazine's Top 100 Singles of All Time, as voted by readers. It is also #14 on Rate Your Music's Top Singles of All Time. The guitar solo is played by Ian Bairnson, best known for his work with Alan Parsons. It is placed rather unobtrusively in the mix, and later engineer Jon Kelly would regret not making the solo a little louder in the mix. The song was significantly re-mixed and given a new lead vocal in 1986 for Bush's greatest-hits album The Whole Story.

	dbo:abstract	"\"You\" is a song by English musician George Harrison, released as the opening track of his 1975 album Extra Texture (Read All About It). It was also the album's lead single, becoming a top 20 hit in America and reaching number 9 in Canada. A 45-second instrumental portion of the song, titled \"A Bit More of You\", appears on Extra Texture also, opening side two of the original LP format. Harrison wrote \"You\" in 1970 as a song for Ronnie Spector, formerly of the Ronettes, and wife of Harrison's All Things Must Pass co-producer Phil Spector. The composition reflects Harrison's admiration for 1960s American soul/R&B, particularly Motown. In February 1971, Ronnie Spector recorded \"You\" in London for a proposed solo album on the Beatles' Apple record label, but the recording remained unissued. Four years later, Harrison returned to this backing track while making his final album for Apple Records, in Los Angeles. The released recording features the 1971 contributions from Leon Russell, Jim Gordon and others, with further instrumentation and vocals overdubbed in 1975, notably a series of saxophone solos by Jim Horn. On release, the song was well received by the majority of music critics, who viewed it as a return to form for Harrison after his disappointing 1974 North American tour and the accompanying Dark Horse album. Dave Marsh of Rolling Stone hailed it as Harrison's best work since his 1970\u201371 hit song \"My Sweet Lord\"; author Ian Inglis describes \"You\" as \"a near-perfect pop song\". Capitol Records included \"You\" as one of just six Harrison solo hits, alongside compositions of his performed with the Beatles, on the 1976 compilation The Best of George Harrison. For the first time since the debut CD release of Extra Texture in the early 1990s, \"You\" was remastered, along with its parent album, as part of Harrison's 2014 Apple Years reissues. Lisa Mychols and Les Fradkin are among the artists who have covered the song."@en ;
