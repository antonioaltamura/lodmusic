	dbo:abstract	"Mate. Feed. Kill. Repeat. is the first release by American metal band Slipknot. Released originally on October 31, 1996, it was limited to production of 1,000 copies. The band originally self-distributed some of these copies, but went on to release the remaining units through -ismist Recordings in 1997. Due to its limited release, the album has become much sought by fans since Slipknot's rise in fame. Despite considering it their first album upon release, the band now considers Mate. Feed. Kill. Repeat. to be a demo and have evolved and released the majority of the songs on future releases, albeit usually in radically altered forms. It was recorded in Des Moines, Iowa, over a period of four months. The music of the album contains many influences including funk, jazz, and disco which weren't as apparent in later material. Many of the lyrics and the album's title are derived from the role playing game Werewolf: The Apocalypse. The songs contain an \"emphasis on non-traditional songwriting\" and melodic themes more than subsequent releases."@en ;

Ocean Beach was also the last album to feature founding guitarist Gorden Mack, as well as being the band's last studio album released by 4AD. The album features an unlisted hidden track, referred to as \"Brockwell Park (Part 2)\" less than 20 seconds after \"Drop\" ends. The double 10\" vinyl release of the album (now long out of print) features the band's acoustic cover of Yes' 1971 hit \"Long Distance Runaround.\" Kozelek would go on to record another version of the song (with electric guitars and an extended outro) for Red House Painters' next album, Songs for a Blue Guitar. A rarely seen music video was produced for the song \"Summer Dress.\" An original idea for the album's front cover artwork was a photo of what could be broken pews in an abandoned church, or old beds in an abandoned hospital ward."@en ;

Continuing in the vein of the band's previous two albums, Sunshine Hit Me and Free the Bees, by recording their music in different locations, Octopus was self-produced in the band's own basement studio, The Steam Rooms, on the Isle of Wight. The style of the record is said to be a mix of both the sounds of its preceding two albums. A high-rip version of Octopus was leaked in its entirety in December 2006, three months before its scheduled release. The leak also led to the album's initial release date of 19 March being moved up a week later. Fortunately, despite these issues, the album was generally well received by fans and critics alike, with some claiming it to be the band's best record to date. The CD version of Octopus is also an enhanced disc, which enables owners of the album to join The Bees' mailing list and get access to exclusive free content, including a downloadable version of the \"Who Cares What The Question Is?\" music video."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Octopus is the seventh full-length studio album recorded by the British synthpop band The Human League. It was produced by the former Tears for Fears keyboard player Ian Stanley and released by EastWest Records in 1995. It was the first new album from the Human League in five years after the termination of their long-term contract with Virgin Records. Octopus was the first Human League album which presented the band as a trio consisting of the singers Philip Oakey, Joanne Catherall and Susan Ann Sulley. The former Human League member Jo Callis and keyboard player Neil Sutton also contributed to the writing of the album. The album's sound is notable for the nearly exclusive use of analogue synthesizers, a marked change from the band's primarily \"digital\" sound in the mid-to-late 1980s. Octopus saw a return to the public eye for The Human League, who had been out of the top ten since their 1986 album Crash. The first single, \"Tell Me When\", received support from MTV in the UK and the U.S. and the song became the band's first top-ten hit in nine years, peaking at number six in the UK singles chart. The single also climbed to number thirty-one in the U.S. Billboard Hot 100. The Octopus album also peaked at number six in the UK, becoming the Human League's sixth top-ten album. It was later certified Gold. The album's second single, \"One Man in My Heart\", was a ballad sung by Sulley which also reached the UK top-twenty and the third single from the album, \"Filling up with Heaven\", was also a top-forty UK hit. Although the album sold well and created a resurgence in interest in the band, East West Records went through a complete change in management and decided to cancel the band's contract as well as those of other established artists. It was another six years before the band released a new album on a new label (Papillion Records)."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Permanent Vacation is the ninth studio album by American rock band Aerosmith, released in August 1987 by Geffen Records. The album marks a turning point in the band's career. It is their first album to employ professional songwriters, instead of featuring material solely composed by members of the band. This came as a suggestion of executive John Kalodner, who also pushed the band to work with producer Bruce Fairbairn, who remained with them for another two albums. It was also the first Aerosmith album to be promoted by heavy music video airplay on MTV. Though Done with Mirrors was intended to mark Aerosmith's comeback, Permanent Vacation is often considered their true comeback album, as it was the band's first truly popular album since their reunion. \"Rag Doll\", \"Dude (Looks Like a Lady)\", and \"Angel\" all became major hit singles (all three songs charted in the Top 20) and helped Permanent Vacation become the band's most successful album in a decade. The album features their cover of \"I'm Down\", a piano-driven Beatles song that appeared as a B-side to their single \"Help!\" in 1965. This was Aerosmith's second commercially released Beatles cover, after \"Come Together\". Permanent Vacation has sold over five million copies in the U.S. In the UK, it was the first Aerosmith album to attain both Silver (60,000 units sold) and Gold (100,000 units sold) certification by the British Phonographic Industry, achieving these in July 1989 and March 1990 respectively. The album's title was later referenced in Aerosmith's 1993 hit single \"Amazing\" from the album Get a Grip."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Personal is the debut studio album by the American vocal group Men of Vizion. It was released on June 18, 1996 via Michael Jackson's record label, MJJ Music, after a demo tape was played to him by producer Teddy Riley. The album has been described as a \"sumptuous blend\" of vocal R&B and \"90s production techniques\", that alternates between smooth ballads and new jack swing. Personal received mixed reviews from music critics, with some critics noting similarities between the group and Boyz II Men. Some critics felt as if the material was unmemorable versions of Boyz II Men songs, while others felt that Personal was highly different from the music at the time. The album only managed to chart in the United States, where it peaked at 14 on the Billboard Heatseekers Albums, 29 on the Billboard R&B Albums and 186 on the Billboard Top 200. Two singles were released to promote the album: \"House Keeper\" and \"Do Thangz\".

This is the sixth full-length live set of previously unreleased material from The Doors' own Bright Midnight Archives. The album includes more than an hour of fire and energy from singer Jim Morrison, keyboardist Ray Manzarek, drummer John Densmore and guitarist Robby Krieger. Always eager to take a chance onstage or otherwise, Morrison experiments with the musical dialogue during a 22-plus-minute version of \"When the Music's Over\", leading the band into bits of songs that they\u2019d never played live. Along with gems like \"Five to One\" and \"Break on Through\", the group also performed covers of Robert Johnson\u2019s \"Cross Road Blues\" and the band\u2019s signature cover of Howling Wolf\u2019s \"Back Door Man\". Before closing with an extended take on \"Light My Fire\", Manzarek took the microphone with backup by Morrison for \"Close to You\". According to Bruce Botnick, \"Jim was as clear as he could be onstage, and the guys moved to and fro with him, trusting the journey. Sometimes The Doors were raging with fire and energy; at other times, when Jim jumped into the lyric of a different song, in the middle of something else, they were right there with him.\""@en ;

During the week of its release, Play accounted for over half of all Taiwanese album sales, beating out its runner up by over 40% of the market share. Over 100,000 copies of the album were pre-ordered; by mid-July, the sales total reached 500,000. Despite being tainted by cross-straits controversy, \"Chinese Language\", the album's lead single, earned six awards, including one for its music video. Due to the overall popularity of the album, Play became the first S.H.E album to warrant its own concert, which was held at the Tamshui Fisherman's Wharf in July. The track, \"\u4E94\u6708\u5929\" (May Day) won one of the Top 10 Songs of the Year at the 2008 HITO Radio Music Awards presented by Taiwanese radio station Hit FM."@en ;

The album was recorded in their newly built studio in the band's native Sunderland. It was released on CD and on plum-coloured vinyl, a reference to the album's title. In an interview with DIY, David Brewis told the magazine, \"I love the fact that the English language has so many homophones. I think it's one of those unique things about the language which really informs the English sense of humour. It tickles me that we can colour all of the album text and the vinyl plum.\" The album's cover art is a collage assembled by Peter Brewis and based on the painting Standard Station by American pop artist Ed Ruscha, a print of which hung in Peter's bathroom. A single, \"(I Keep Thinking About) A New Thing\", was released in December 2011. A second track, \"A New Town\", was also made available to download for free ahead of the album's release. \"Who'll Pay the Bills?\" was the third single released.

It is the first Stratovarius album to feature bassist Lauri Porra and guitarist Matias Kupiainen, following former bassist Jari Kainulainen's departure from the band in 2005 and former guitarist Timo Tolkki's departure in 2008. Timo Kotipelto, who at the time of Polaris' release had been a member of Statovarius in the earliest year (1994) among the current members, considered Polaris to be \"the album that saved the band\" and said that \"without it there would not be any Stratovarius.\" More time passed between the release of Stratovarius' eponymous album Stratovarius in 2005 and the release of Polaris than between any other two consecutive albums released by the band. Stratovarius in 2006 had recorded a demo album called Revolution Renaissance, performed one Revolution Renaissance song live in August 2007 (\"Last Night on Earth\") and according to Kotipelto had intended to release a completed version of Revolution Renaissance in 2008. However, the songs of that album were re-recorded and released in 2008 as New Era, the first album of Tolkki's new band, Revolution Renaissance, which acquired the album's prior name. Polaris reached No. 2 on the Finnish albums chart, as well as reaching the top 70 in five other countries. \"Deep Unknown\" was released as a single, reaching No. 20 on the Finnish singles chart.

Preservation was not well received by critics and sold poorly (peaking on the Billboard 200 at #177), though the live performances of the material were much better received. Many hardcore Kinks fans were alienated by Ray Davies' melodramatic songwriting during the Preservation project era, resulting in albums that played more like the soundtracks to a piece of musical theatre than rock albums.[citation needed] However, more recent reviews of Preservation: Act 1 have been more sympathetic to its ambitions.[citation needed] In particular, AllMusics Stephen Thomas Erlewine has declared \"Sweet Lady Genevieve\" to be the \"real candidate for Davies' forgotten masterpiece\". The 1991 CD reissue on Rhino was a 2-CD set combining Preservation: Act 1 with its 1974 follow-up Preservation: Act 2, but with no bonus tracks other than an extended mix of \"Money & Corruption / I Am Your Man\", featuring an extra instrumental break. The 1998 CD reissue of Preservation: Act 1 on Velvel includes the single versions of \"Preservation\" and \"One of the Survivors\", neither of which are available on the original vinyl release.

Pretty Hate Machine is compiled of reworked tracks from the Purest Feeling demo, as well as songs composed after its original recording. Three singles were released from the album, the most successful being \"Head Like a Hole\", which has become a staple in Nine Inch Nails live performances. The album became one of the first independently released records to attain platinum certification. On May 12, 2003 the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) certified the album triple platinum, indicating sales of three million copies in the United States. Although it was critically and commercially successful for an independent label, Trent Reznor (Nine Inch Nails' only constant band member) feuded with TVT (the album's original label) during its promotion. The album was out of print from 1997 to 2005, because of the much publicized disagreement between Reznor and the record label. Rykodisc re-released the album worldwide in 2005, effectively putting the album back into print. A remastered version was released on November 22, 2010.

	dbo:abstract	"Rapture is the third studio album by Australian pop band, The Mavis's, which was posthumously released in March 2003 by their record label, Festival Mushroom Records. It was produced by Kalju Tonuma, who had also worked on their previous two studio albums. The album's lead single, \"Coming Home\" (July 2000), peaked at No. 72 on the ARIA Singles Chart. The second single, \"Happiness\", was released in February 2001, which reached the top 100 on the ARIA Singles Chart and No. 9 on the related ARIA Alternative Singles Chart. The album had been delayed from its originally proposed release date of July 2001 due to problems between the band and the label. According to Matt Atlee of Australian Music Scrapbook website it was an \"amicable split\", however Christie Eliezer of Music & Media Business News reported that \"Despite what both sides say, the Mavis's split from Festival Mushroom Records and the canning of the July-due Rapture album was far from amicable.\" In July to August 2001 the group toured Australia and performed tracks from the album, before disbanding in December. Five months prior to the studio album's appearance, Festival Mushroom Records issued a compilation album, Throwing Little Stones... The Best of (20 October 2002), which included tracks from Rapture. At subsequent reunion concerts by The Mavis's, in February 2013 and December 2014, they played material from all three of their studio albums."@en ;

To ensure that the finished product retained the sound of these artists, he also recorded the tracks in the same studios these artists used, and also used their record producers. Reload became the highest seller of Jones' career, reaching #1 on the British charts in 1999 and again in 2000. Its biggest single was the collaboration with Mousse T, \"Sexbomb\", which reached #3 on the UK Singles Chart, and was later used in a 2003 episode of The Simpsons (a show Jones had guest starred on in 1992). The album has sold more than six million copies worldwide. The album was not released immediately in the US with Jones's US record company stating that many of the artists were not known outside of the UK. Jones announced plans to record additional tracks with well-known US artists to prepare the album for US release. This did not occur.[citation needed]"@en ;

While the city around it lay in ruin, this one tree stood, half of it destroyed, the other untouched. DiFranco also references the eucalyptus tree in the title track about the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.

	dbo:abstract	"Smiley Smile is the 12th studio album by American rock band the Beach Boys, released on September 18, 1967. Though the album reached number 9 on UK record charts, Smiley Smile only resonated moderately with US audiences, reaching number 41 \u2013 the lowest chart placement the band had yet had for a record. Critics generally received the album with confusion. Discounting the inclusion of standalone single \"Good Vibrations\" and the solo-credited \"Gettin' Hungry\", only one single was issued from Smiley Smile: \"Heroes and Villains\". Devised as a simplified version of their then-forthcoming Smile \u2013 a different LP which would have contained elaborately orchestrated compositions \u2013 Smiley Smile is best known for its contrasting lo-fi production with an avant-garde and protominimal rock approach to arranging. The album was largely recorded in a span of six weeks at Brian Wilson's makeshift home studio following his declaration that most of the Smile tapes were now distinctly off-limits. After settling payment disputes with Capitol Records, Smiley Smile was distributed in collaboration with Brother Records, a new record label and holding company founded by the group. Smile was left unfinished while the group embarked on new projects. Carl Wilson famously compared Smiley Smile and Smile to \"a bunt instead of a grand slam\". Smiley Smile has since grown in stature over the years to become a cult and critical favorite in the Beach Boys' oeuvre. In 1974, it was voted the 64th greatest album of all time by NME writers. In 2000, it was one of 100 albums featured in the book The Ambient Century as a landmark in the development of ambient music."@en ;

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/So_(album)>	rdf:type	schema:MusicAlbum ;
	dbo:abstract	"So is the fifth album by English rock musician Peter Gabriel, released on 19 May 1986 by Charisma Records. After working on the soundtrack to the film Birdy (1984), producer Daniel Lanois was invited to remain at Gabriel's home during 1985 to work on his next singing project. Initial sessions for So consisted of Gabriel, Lanois and guitarist David Rhodes, although these grew to include a number of percussionists. Although Gabriel continued to use the pioneering Fairlight CMI synthesizer, songs from these sessions were notably less experimental than his previous material, and fused pop and art rock with elements of traditional world music, particularly African and Brazilian styles. It is Gabriel's first non-eponymous album, So representing an \"anti-title\" that resulted from label pressure to properly market his music. Widely regarded as his best album, as well as his most accessible, it transformed Gabriel from a cult artist into a mainstream star. It received positive reviews from critics, who praised its melodicism and fusion of genres, and was nominated for the Grammy Award for Album of the Year. Gabriel toured So on the This Way Up tour (1986\u20131987), with some songs performed at human rights and charity concerts during this period. So is Gabriel's best-selling solo release, and has been certified fivefold platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America and triple platinum by the British Phonographic Industry. It spawned five singles, \"Sledgehammer\", \"Don't Give Up\", \"Big Time\", \"In Your Eyes\" and \"Red Rain\". \"Sledgehammer\" achieved particular success, reaching number one on the Billboard Hot 100 and winning a record of ten MTV Video Music Awards. So was remastered in 2002, partially re-recorded for Gabriel's 2012 orchestral project New Blood and issued as a box set the same year. It has been deemed one of the best albums of the 1980s and is listed at number 187 in Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time."@en ;

The album was recorded in November 2000 at Westbeach Recorders in California. Although the album only sold 300 copies in its first week of release, the album has sold 370,000 copies worldwide with 310,000 sold in America, as of November 2010. The title 'Sounding the Seventh Trumpet' takes its name from the Book of Revelation, specifically referencing chapter 11 and the sounding of the last (seventh) trumpet, showing the end of the world. Valary DiBenedetto (M. Shadows' future wife) performs vocals on the track \"The Art of Subconscious Illusion.\" The album was released as 2x12 vinyl, LP, 33 \u2153 RPM, Purple on 2008 in US. Sounding the Seventh Trumpet is widely agreed as Avenged Sevenfold's heaviest album, with chugging guitars, very little clean vocals, and The Rev's blistering drums. Sounding the Seventh Trumpet was recorded with a tiny budget of $2,000. When the band members got into the studio, The Rev recorded all the drums in one take, and the other members of the band added their parts to what he had laid down. Zacky Vengeance played lead guitar originally. Then, when Synyster Gates joined the band, they recorded a heavy metal version of \"To End the Rapture\" with Gates playing lead guitar. This heavy metal version was first seen on the Warmness on the Soul EP, and was later featured on the re-release of Sounding the Seventh Trumpet. On August 7, 2003, Charles Cross of Rolling Stone declared Avenged Sevenfold the, \"Warped Tour 2003 Second Stage Must-See.\""@en ;

Ken Scott, producer and engineer of Spectrum, on recording Cobham's drums: \"Bill Cobham's drums were treated in exactly the same way as I recorded every other drummer. I just used more mics: Neumann U67s on toms, D20s or RE20s (at Electric Lady) on the bass drums, Neumann KM54 or 56 on snare, and either STC 4038s or Beyer M160 ribbon mics for the overheads. One other thing: in order to dampen the snare, Bill just laid his wallet on the top head.\" Leland Sklar, bassist on Spectrum: \"Spectrum is such a benchmark for so many people. There was a sort of fire in it. It was new ground and it wasn't very analytical. It was more flying by the seat of your pants. That's where great accidents happen, which seems impossible these days. We never did more than a couple of takes on any of it. It was more or less a two-day record. It went by so fast.\" Tommy Bolin, who would go on to join the hard rock band Deep Purple two years later, plays lead guitar.

Nova fans may interpret the lack of pop flourishes to be a testament to a love of music and her desire to further develop as an artist rather than succumb to commercial pressures (which Nova cited as being her reason for leaving her previous label.) Upon the release of Redbird, an article written in promotion by Nova's record label offered a sales figure of 400,000 copies for Storm, a strong figure for an independent release with limited distribution and lack of any radio play for the single.[citation needed]"@en ;

The song \"Storm\" was released as the album's only single. The album shows something of a return to gothic metal, although its sound is much lighter and more upbeat than that of earlier albums and it still uses modern English lyrics. The band embarked on a European tour to support the release. The cover art was designed by Thomas Ewerhard, who also made the covers for Assembly and Forever Is The World. The song \"Senseless\" was originally titled \"Seven\", as it is written in septuple meter and is the seventh track on the album."@en ;

The album is the first to feature drummer Thomas Pridgen, and the last to include both guitarist and sound manipulator Paul Hinojos, and wind multi-instrumentalist Adri\u00E1n Terrazas-Gonz\u00E1lez. The album debuted at #3 on the Billboard 200, becoming the band's highest charting release after selling over 54,000 copies in its opening week. \"Wax Simulacra\" was released on November 19, 2007 as the album's first single, coupled with a cover version of \"Pulled to Bits\", originally by Siouxsie and the Banshees. Vinyl editions of the album include a ouija inside the gatefold, claimed to be the band's own take on the board they previously owned. \"Wax Simulacra\" won at the 51st Grammy Awards for Best Hard Rock Performance. Having previously contributed the artwork to the 2006 release of Amputechture, Jeff Jordan was again brought in to handle the illustrations for the album, creating 11 original paintings to coincide with the theme of The Bedlam in Goliath, as well as including a piece from his own gallery.

It was produced by longtime Radiohead producer Nigel Godrich. The album comprises electronic music Yorke recorded during Radiohead's 2004 hiatus and between their 2005 rehearsals. The lyrics express Yorke's political concerns; \"Harrowdown Hill\" was written about the death of David Kelly, a whistleblower who allegedly committed suicide after telling a reporter that the British government had falsely identified weapons of mass destructions in Iraq. The album artwork, by longtime Radiohead cover artist Stanley Donwood, was inspired by the legend of King Canute failing to command the ocean, which Yorke likened to government attitudes towards climate change. The Eraser debuted at number three on the UK Albums Chart and number two on the American Billboard 200. It was named one of the best albums of 2006 by the NME, Rolling Stone and the Observer, and was nominated for the 2006 Mercury Music Prize and the 2007 Grammy Award for Best Alternative Music Album. Two singles were released from the album: \"Analyse\" and \"Harrowdown Hill\". It was followed in the same year by a B-sides EP, Spitting Feathers, and in 2009 a remix album, The Eraser Rmxs.

After an album as dark and intense as Tender Prey, some fans were disappointed to hear a relaxed and loving Nick Cave on this record. The change of mood was due in great deal to Nick Cave falling in love with Brazilian journalist Viviane Carneiro, and an apparently salutary spell in rehab which purged the despair and squalor of the previous two albums. However, today, most fans consider this album as a classic that was unfairly judged at the time. Indeed, \"The Weeping Song\" and \"The Ship Song\" are now Bad Seeds standards, and the relatively obscure closing track \"Lucy\" was resurrected in 1993 as a B-side of \"What a Wonderful World\", a collaboration of the Bad Seeds and the Pogues' Shane MacGowan. Cave later said, \"I guess The Good Son is some kind of reflection of the way I felt early on in Brazil. I was quite happy there. I was in love and the first year or two was good. The problem I found was... in order to survive you have to adopt their attitudes towards everything, which are kind of blinkered.\" The album was remastered and reissued on March 29, 2010 as a collector's edition CD/DVD set."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"The Great Deceiver is a live 4CD box set by the band King Crimson, released on Virgin Records in 1992. In 2007, it was reissued as two volumes of 2 CDs each. The track listing on the volume 1 CD 1 lists 11 tracks, incorrectly listing The Talking Drum and the abbreviated \"Larks' Tongues in Aspic, Part Two\" from the Pittsburgh show from CD 1 of the volume 2 set. The box set features live recordings of the band from 1973 and 1974. All recordings feature the lineup of Robert Fripp, John Wetton, David Cross and Bill Bruford. Jamie Muir, who left the band in early 1973, is not featured on the set. The band's 1974 concert from Providence, Rhode Island is presented in its entirety on CDs One and Two; this was the second-to-last live concert ever performed by this incarnation of King Crimson. King Crimson's \"Walk On\" music in 1973-74 was an excerpt of \"The Heavenly Music Corporation,\" from the album (No Pussyfooting) by Robert Fripp and Brian Eno. These \"walk-ons\" are reproduced here, and indexed as separate tracks. Three recordings from this box set were previously available on other King Crimson albums, albeit in slightly altered forms. An abbreviated version of \"We'll Let You Know\" appears on the Starless and Bible Black album, released in 1974. Similarly, an abbreviated version of \"Providence\" was included on the Red album, also released in 1974. The live performance of \"21st Century Schizoid Man\" on CD Two was issued in 1975 as part of the album USA, featuring overdubbed violin from Eddie Jobson. Many of the recordings on this album are band improvisations. \"The Law of Maximum Distress\" appears in two sections, as the tape ran out in the middle of the song. Much of the missing material seems to be used on \"The Mincer\" from Starless and Bible Black. As Robert Fripp notes in the CD jacket, \"Most live recording follows the policy of two machines in use simultaneously to meet an eventuality such as this. We learn.\" The liner notes to The Great Deceiver run to 68 pages. These notes feature comments from Fripp, Wetton and Cross, annotated excerpts from Fripp's 1974 diary, reviews of the previous King Crimson box set, Frame by Frame: The Essential King Crimson (1991), and a complete listing of all concerts performed by the band in 1973 and 1974. The track \"Exiles\" is credited to Fripp/Wetton/Palmer-James on this box set. The correct credit, as listed on Larks' Tongues in Aspic and confirmed by BMI's records, is Cross/Fripp/Palmer-James. Despite having no legal co-writing credit for the song, John Wetton has indicated in interviews that he wrote the bridge for \"Exiles.\"[citation needed]"@en ;

dbr:The_Human_Equation	rdf:type	schema:MusicAlbum ;
	dbo:abstract	"The Human Equation is the sixth album from the progressive rock project Ayreon by Dutch musician Arjen Anthony Lucassen, released on May 25, 2004 via InsideOut Music. As with other Ayreon albums, it features guest appearances from several musicians previously unrelated to the project, including James LaBrie of Dream Theater, Mikael \u00C5kerfeldt of Opeth, Eric Clayton of Saviour Machine, and Devin Townsend, performing music arranged and written by Lucassen. As with nearly every Ayreon album, it is a concept album with each character being portrayed by one singer. However unlike previous albums, The Human Equation is not a sci-fi story but take place almost entirely in the mind of a character called Me (played by LaBrie) who is in a coma after a car accident, with each song consisting of one day spent in coma. While his Wife (Marcela Bovio) and Best Friend (Lucassen) are at his side in the real world, Me, trapped in his own mind, encounters representations of his own feelings and recall his life from his childhood to his accident. The album was released in three different editions: a regular edition with two CDs, a Special Edition with two CDs and a DVD, and a Limited Deluxe Edition with two CDs, a DVD and a 36-page booklet. The album peaked at #7 at Dutch Albums Chart and at #50 at Germany Albums Top 50. The album was also released on vinyl in December 2012. The Human Equation is, together with Into the Electric Castle and The Theory of Everything, the only Ayreon albums in which Lucassen did not write all the lyrics: Townsend wrote all the lyrics of his character Rage, while Heather Findlay of Mostly Autumn and Devon Graves of Deadsoul Tribe also wrote some of the lyrics of their characters, Love and Agony. The albums marks the first collaboration between Lucassen and Bovio, selected by Lucassen via an internet female singing contest to play Wife. The following year, Bovio and Lucassen created together progressive/symphonic metal band Stream of Passion."@en ;

Burroughs' book of short stories Interzone and the band's interest in eastern mysticism and esoteric philosophies, the songwriting on The Interzone Mantras builds on the subtle electronica and ballads of Triptych, whilst returning to the familiar territory of their earlier albums with 70's rock and world music influences. Jeff Martin explained that the album was a return to basics:Lyrically the album draws from the works of modern writers Aleister Crowley, Mikhail Bulgakov, Wim Wenders, to ancient Greek mythology (Morpheus on \"Lullaby\"). The lyrics themselves written by Martin when holidaying in Prague, after the music was written from jams in the band's rehearsal space. The first 100,000 Canadian copies of The Interzone Mantras were packaged with a special lenticular cover, with Alessandro Bavari's depiction of Shiva moving depending on the viewing angle. Although not as commercially successful as previous albums, The Interzone Mantras is The Tea Party's highest charting album in Australia (debuting at #6 on the ARIA chart) and is certified Gold in Canada. It was also nominated for \"Rock Album of the Year\" at the 2003 Juno Awards."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"The Rose is the soundtrack to the feature film of the same name starring Bette Midler which was released in 1979. Midler performs all the songs on the album, with the exception of the instrumental \"Camellia\". Apart from the title track, the soundtrack was entirely recorded live and also features concert monologues, with Midler portraying the character The Rose, loosely based on legendary blues singer Janis Joplin. The soundtrack was produced by Paul A. Rothchild, who in fact also had worked with Joplin on what was to become her final album before her death in 1970, entitled Pearl and released posthumously. Midler's portrayal of The Rose, which was her acting debut, earned her an Oscar nomination for Best Actress in 1980 and became the start of her career in movies. The first single to be lifted off the soundtrack was Midler's rendition of Percy Sledge's \"When a Man Loves a Woman\" which became a moderate chart hit, peaking at #35 on Billboard's single chart. The studio recorded title track (written by Amanda McBroom) which closes the album however became a top 3 hit for Midler, and also a #1 on the Adult Contemporary chart, and today counts as one of her signature tunes. The alternate single version with orchestral overdubs was not included on the actual soundtrack but later appeared on hits compilations like Experience the Divine along with \"When A Man Love A Woman\". One track featured in the movie, Bob Seger's \"Fire Down Below\", was omitted from the album but Midler recorded a second live version of the song later in 1980 for the soundtrack to her concert documentary Divine Madness. \"Keep On Rockin'\" was the second Sammy Hagar track Midler recorded, his hard rock track \"Red\" was featured on her 1977 studio album Broken Blossom. The Rose soundtrack also included one song that since its original release has become a mainstay in Midler's live repertoire, Jerry Ragovoy's despairing blues ballad \"Stay With Me\". The Rose peaked at #12 on Billboard's album chart in the Spring of 1980, making it Midler's bestselling album since 1973's Bette. The album was digitally remastered and reissued on CD by Atlantic Records/Warner Music in 1995 but with no bonus tracks."@en ;

It was released on November 30, 1982, as the follow-up to Jackson's critically and commercially successful 1979 album Off the Wall. Thriller explores similar genres to those of Off the Wall, including pop, post-disco, rock and funk. Recording sessions took place on April to November 1982 at Westlake Recording Studios in Los Angeles with a production budget of $750,000, assisted by producer Quincy Jones. Of the album's nine tracks, four were written by Jackson. Seven singles were released from the album, all of which reached the top 10 on the Billboard Hot 100. Three of the singles had music videos released. \"Baby Be Mine\" and \"The Lady in My Life\" were the only tracks that were not released as singles. In just over a year, Thriller became\u2014and currently remains\u2014the best-selling album of all time, with estimated sales of 65 million copies worldwide according to various sources. In the United States, it is the best-selling album and has become the first album ever to be certified 32 times multi-platinum for U.S. sales, marking more than 32 million sales shipped. The album won a record-breaking eight Grammy Awards in 1984, including for Album of the Year. Thriller enabled Jackson to break down racial barriers in pop music via his appearances on MTV and meeting with President of the United States Ronald Reagan at the White House. The album was one of the first to use music videos as successful promotional tools\u2014the videos for \"Thriller\", \"Billie Jean\" and \"Beat It\" all received regular rotation on MTV. In 2001, a special edition issue of the album was released, which contains additional audio interviews, demo recordings and the song \"Someone in the Dark\", which was a Grammy-winning track from the E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial storybook. In 2008, the album was reissued again as Thriller 25, containing re-mixes that feature contemporary artists, a previously unreleased song and a DVD, which features the short films from the album and the Motown 25 performance of \"Billie Jean\". That same year the album was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame along with Jackson's Off The Wall LP.

	dbo:abstract	"Thriller 25 is the 25th anniversary edition reissue of American recording artist Michael Jackson's sixth studio album Thriller. The original album sold between 51 and 65 million copies worldwide, making it the world's best selling album of all time. The prospect of a \"second chapter\" to Thriller was first publicly discussed on Access Hollywood in late 2006. Jackson said he would discuss the idea with collaborator will.i.am. It was released in Australia on February 8, 2008, internationally on February 11, 2008, and in the United States on February 12, 2008 by Epic Records, Legacy Recordings and MJJ Productions. Thriller 25 was released by Sony BMG's re-issue division, Legacy Recordings. In the United Kingdom, the BBFC gave it a '15' certificate because it included the video for \"Thriller\". It is the first Jackson album with an age certificate. Along with the original material, the reissue contained remixes, new material, a DVD and collaborations with several contemporary artists. Two singles, \"The Girl Is Mine 2008\" and \"Wanna Be Startin' Somethin' 2008\", were released from the album to moderate success and a number of the other remixes charted, despite no physical release. Thriller 25 was a commercial success, selling three million copies worldwide in its 12 weeks, and was generally well received among critics, despite their view that the new material was not as inspiring as the original."@en ;

Released on October 22, 1996, the album marked the reunion of the classic 1980s lineup, which had not recorded together since 1983's Frontiers. Trial by Fire was produced by Kevin Shirley, who continues to produce the band's albums until now. The first album to feature bassist Ross Valory since Frontiers and the last to feature vocalist Steve Perry, and the most recent to feature drummer Steve Smith who re-joined Journey in 2015. Trial by Fire includes the Top 20 hit and Grammy nominated single \"When You Love a Woman\", which reached No. 12 and No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 and Adult Contemporary charts respectively. \"Message of Love\", \"Can't Tame the Lion\" and \"If He Should Break Your Heart\" were released as singles and received radio airplay. The album reflected a growing maturity with the members of Journey and could be loosely termed a concept album with many tracks reflecting a more overt spirituality in lyrical content. The title track, for example, is taken directly from Paul's First Epistle to the Corinthians. Trial by Fire was Journey's last album featuring vocalist Steve Perry and the only one to not be accompanied by a supporting tour. That was due to internal disputes over a tour (originally scheduled for the summer and fall of 1997), as a result of Perry's hip injury as he prolonged getting the necessary surgery. If the band had toured, the tour wouldn't start until over a year after the album's release. Perry left the band feeling that he was being forced out over his mulling over his decision to have the necessary surgery and because of the other band members' pressure to tour sooner than later. Drummer Steve Smith also quit citing that the band without Perry didn't interest him. On November 9, 1996, the album peaked at No. 3 on the Billboard 200 and was eventually certified platinum in the United States by the RIAA. The band did not receive another platinum award until Revelation in 2008."@en ;

Released by Sire Records, Jourgensen was granted more artistic control over the production than under Arista/BMG. Twitch was re-released in 1990 with two additional tracks. Twitched, an unauthorized 2003 release by Radioactive Records, is a remastered version of Twitch, featuring the track listing that the band is said to have intended it to have before the intervention of the record company. It includes previously unreleased alternative versions of tracks from the album. \"Over the Shoulder\" was the only single from the album."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Ugly is the second album released by American alternative metal band Life of Agony. Ugly was a considerable shift in sound from the hardcore and groove metal sounds of their 1993 debut River Runs Red. Although it still featured the band's trademark and pulverizing riffs, ('I Regret', 'Damned If I Do', 'Fears') the gang vocals and pummelling double-kick drumming had been dropped, Caputo also opted for a cleaner vocal delivery - eschewing his previous baritone howl. Songs like 'Let's Pretend' and 'How It Would Be' display the album's more emotional turn and were written about Caputo's mother who had died when he was young. The opener, 'Seasons', was written about his relationship with his father. It was released in 1995 through Roadrunner Records (see 1995 in music). Sal Abruscato left the band after the album's tour in 1996, but later rejoined for their first reunion in 2002."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Up All Night is the debut studio album by English-Irish group One Direction, released by Syco Records in November 2011 in Ireland and the United Kingdom, followed by a worldwide release during 2012. Four months after finishing third in the seventh series of British reality singing contest The X Factor in December 2010, One Direction began recording the album in Sweden, UK and the United States, working with a variety of writers and producers. The album is predominantly a pop music album which orientates into pop rock, dance-pop, teen pop and power pop. The album's lyrical content regards being young, relationships, heartbreak and empowerment. Staged in support of the album, One Direction performed the album's songs live on televised shows, at awards ceremonies, and during their worldwide Up All Night Tour. The album received generally favourable reviews from contemporary music critics, many of whom appreciated the album's combination of melodic song craft and catchy, pop-oriented material that, while slickly produced, avoided the commercial cynicism and adult contemporary posturing of some of their '80s and '90s forebears. An international success, the album topped the charts in sixteen countries and, by December 2012, has sold over 4.5 million copies worldwide. The album bowed at number two on the UK Albums Chart and ultimately became the UK's fastest-selling debut album of 2011. Up All Night debuted to number one on the United States Billboard 200, selling 176,000 copies in its first week. According to the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI), Up All Night was the third global best-selling album of 2012 with sales of 4.5 million copies. One Direction finished 2012 with two of that year's top five best-selling albums in the United States; Up All Night at number three and their second studio album, Take Me Home, at number five, making the boy band the first act to place two albums in the year-end top five in the Nielsen SoundScan era. In addition, Up All Night became the best-selling album by a group and the third best-selling debut album of 2012. Four singles were released from the album, including the UK Singles Chart top ten hits \"What Makes You Beautiful\", \"Gotta Be You\", and \"One Thing\"."@en ;

The album was produced in the five years following the release of Kerli's debut album Love Is Dead (2008) and was originally intended as Kerli's second studio album. The songs from the EP feature an overall positive message and a heavily electronic dance-influenced sound (a stark contrast from Love Is Dead) and feature production by Swedish production duo SeventyEight as well as English producer and DJ Switch. Two songs that were written for the album, \"Army of Love\" and \"Zero Gravity\", were released as promotional singles in 2010 and 2012 respectively prior to release of the EP's lead single in 2013 titled \"The Lucky Ones\". Two other songs intended for the album (which were written by Kerli, Toby Gad, and Lindy Robbins) titled \"I Feel Immortal\" and \"Skyscraper\" were recorded by artists Tarja Turunen and Demi Lovato for their albums What Lies Beneath (2010) and Unbroken (2011) respectively, the latter song peaking at number ten on the Billboard Hot 100. Although Kerli's version of \"Skyscraper\" was never officially released, her version of \"I Feel Immortal\" titled \"Immortal\" was released on Frankenweenie Unleashed! in 2012 and the demo version of \"Skyscraper\" sung by Kerli leaked online the same year. \"Zero Gravity\", \"Army of Love\", and \"The Lucky Ones\" all charted in the top ten of Billboard's Hot Dance Club Songs chart, the last two peaking at number one.

	dbo:abstract	"Vegas is a one-off collaborative album between British solo-artist Terry Hall - formerly of the 2 Tone and ska revival band The Specials - with Dave Stewart formerly of Eurythmics. The duo working with Eurythmics assistants engineer and drummer Olle Romo and engineer Manu Guiot recorded under the group name Vegas. Vegas includes the singles \"Possessed\", \"She\" and \"Walk into the Wind\". Of the three only \"Possessed\" charted in the UK Top 40. Receiving positive reviews the album was released on CD, Cassette and vinyl LP by the major record label RCA/BMG in October 1992, but failed to chart. The album has since been deleted. The album was written by Hall and Stewart with the exception of the musical standard \"She\". No performer credits are provided, Allmusic speculates that Vegas is almost certainly a Dave Stewart production. Dave Stewart likely was responsible for the lion's share of the musical backing with assistance from Romo and Guiot and Hall contributing his vocal. Following the album's commercial failure the group split. Hall subsequently launched a solo-career, releasing Home in 1994. Stewart also returned to solo-work, releasing Greetings from the Gutter in 1994. The pair re-united in 1997 to support Bob Dylan during his Never Ending Tour for a pair of concerts in Japan."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Vices is the third full-length album by Christian hard rock band Dead Poetic. The album was released on October 31, 2006 through Tooth & Nail Records. Aaron Sprinkle once again produced the album, and Chino Moreno of Deftones contributed guest vocals to \"Paralytic.\" Lead vocalist Brandon Rike left the band shortly before the album's release and the band's remaining members opted not to continue with the band, although recently it has been stated that the band has not broken up, and will continue writing music. The album is a departure from Dead Poetic's earlier work in many ways. First, only Rike and guitarist Zach Miles remained from the band's lineup on its 2004 breakthrough, New Medicines. Second, Rike does not scream on the record, thus abandoning the band's earlier post-hardcore sound in favor of straight-up rock & roll. Finally, as a result of this shift in styles, Vices is released solely through Tooth & Nail, not through Tooth & Nail's heavier subsidiary Solid State Records, which released the band's first two albums. Vices peaked at #7 on the Billboard Heatseekers Chart."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Wah Wah, the sixth full-length release by the Manchester indie rock group James, was produced by Brian Eno and Markus Dravs during the same six-week session as Laid. Although the group had always been keen on improvisation, both as their principal songwriting method and onstage, this was their first (and, thus far, only) album to be composed entirely of such material. It was Eno's idea that the group's improvisations should be recorded, having told them that he regarded this music as having equal importance to the finished songs birthed from it. However, the group told Stuart Maconie (for their authorised biography Folklore) that the album caused disagreements, particularly over Tim Booth's wish to redo some vocals and over how to deal with the finished record - originally planned as a giveaway with early copies of Laid, it was eventually issued as a limited edition several months later. One track, Jam-J was chosen as a single, and released as a double-A side, along with \"Say Something\" from the album Laid. The track \"Tomorrow\" was later re-recorded from scratch and placed on the band's next release, the album Whiplash as well as being culled as the second single from that record. The album cover states that the album is by James but a sticker on the cover reads \"James / Eno\"."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Warrior is the second studio album by American recording artist Kesha, released on November 30, 2012 by Kemosabe Records and RCA Records. Its music spans the electropop, technopop, pop rock, and hip hop genres; Kesha described the album as more personal than her previous material in addition to her attempt at reviving the rock genre, calling it a \"cock pop\" record. Its theme is said to be magic. Writing for Warrior began in late 2011 and ended in early 2012, with recording taking place from January through August 2012. Kesha wrote the majority of the album while touring internationally and during her spiritual journey. Contributions to the album's production came from longtime collaborators Dr. Luke (who was also the executive producer of the project), Max Martin, Shellback, Ammo and Benny Blanco. It features guest vocals from American rock singer Iggy Pop, who has been cited as a major influence on the album, as well as writing contributions from Nate Ruess from American indie rock trio Fun, American rapper will.i.am, singer-songwriter Bonnie McKee, The Black Keys drummer Patrick Carney, American rock bands The Strokes and The Flaming Lips and Kesha's own mother, Pebe Sebert. Upon its release, Warrior received generally favorable reviews from music critics, who commended its rock-influenced material, lyrical content, and collaborations whilst others criticized its use of Auto Tune and formulaic content. The album reached number 6 on the U.S. Billboard 200, also charting within Canada, Australia, United Kingdom, Japan and others. The album's lead single \"Die Young\" achieved commercial success, peaking at number 2 on the Billboard Hot 100 and charting in multiple countries worldwide. \"C'mon\" initially served as a promotional single, and peaked at number 27 after its release as the second single. An acoustic extended play (EP) Deconstructed was exclusively released through her website to promote the fan edition of the album, and features re-record tracks from her previous releases and a cover of \"Old Flames Can't Hold a Candle to You\" by American country recording artist Dolly Parton, which was co-written by Kesha's mother, Pebe Sebert. \"Crazy Kids\" was released as the third and final single from Warrior.

The album's songs deal with numerous themes. \"Wire\", the title track, is a song about the pressure to succeed in modern society. \"I Believe\", \"I Got a Feeling\", \"Innocent\", and other tracks deal with sin, faith, and renewal from a Christian perspective. \"Billy Brown\" is a catchy song that explores the readiness of people to follow and even idolize entertainment figures. In November 2004, a live version of Wire was released, called Live Wire featuring a DVD and CD of songs from their tour of their latest album.

The record is the final studio album featuring Boris Williams and the first featuring Perry Bamonte, as well as being the last album featuring Porl Thompson for sixteen years. Whilst retaining the sound and mood of Disintegration (1989) on some tracks, Wish often found the band moving into more of a pop direction, and received positive reviews upon release, including a four star review in Rolling Stone that stated: \"For its cult of millions, the Cure offers the only kind of optimism that makes sense.\" Wish was also the band's overall highest charting album, and most commercially successful in the band's career, given its debut at number one in the UK and number two in the United States, where it sold more than 1.2 million copies. Wish was also nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Alternative Music Album in 1993. The album's first single was \"High\", released on 16 March 1992. The single peaked at number eight in the UK Singles Chart, forty-two in the US Billboard Hot 100 and number one on the Billboard Modern Rock Tracks. The album's second single, \"Friday I'm in Love\", released on 11 May 1992, became one of the band's most popular songs \u2013 reaching number six in the UK Singles Chart and number eighteen in the Billboard Hot 100, and number one in the Modern Rock Tracks. The final single was for \"A Letter to Elise\", going at number twenty-eight in the UK and 2 in the Modern Rock Tracks. On 16 November 1993, a limited EP called Lost Wishes was released on cassette with four new tracks on it.

Smith became famous after her participation in Britain's Got Talent in 2008, and subsequently, aged 13, signed with Universal Classics and Jazz, releasing her debut album, Faryl. Released only a few months afterwards, Wonderland contains a mix of classical and non-classical songs, which were chosen by both Smith and her record label. A concept album, it is based on Alice in Wonderland, and features a digitally produced \"duet\" with Luciano Pavarotti, who died in 2007, as well as a song set to \"Winter\", from Vivaldi's Four Seasons. As with Faryl, Wonderland was produced by Jon Cohen. Smith promoted the album with appearances on television and radio. For the most part, critics responded positively to the album, with praise for Smith's vocals, the song choice and the musical arrangement, but criticism for \"the lack of emotional weight\". Further, critics observed that Smith's voice had improved since her appearance on Britain's Got Talent. Despite this, Wonderland appeared in the UK Albums Chart for only one week, peaking at 54, proving less successful than Faryl. Smith later rerecorded \"The Prayer\", her cover of which was originally released on Wonderland, with 22 other classical artists, with proceeds going to charity."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Yellow Magic Orchestra is the first official studio album by Japanese electronic music band Yellow Magic Orchestra, who were previously known as the Yellow Magic Band. Originally released by Alfa Records in Japan in 1978, the album was released by A&M Records in Europe and North America in early 1979, with the United States version featuring new cover art but without the closing track of \"Acrobat\". Both versions would later be re-issued in 2003 as a double-disc format, with the American version as the first disc. The album was an early example of synthpop, a genre that the band helped pioneer. It was also as an early example of a computer-themed album, and contributed to the development of electro, hip hop, techno, bleep techno, and chiptune. The album's innovations in electronic music included its use of the microprocessor-based Roland MC-8 Microcomposer music sequencer which allowed the creation of new electronic sounds, and its sampling of video game sounds. The album sold 250,000 copies in Japan and entered the Billboard 200 and R&B Albums charts in the United States. Its most successful single was \"Computer Game / Firecracker\", which sold over 400,000 records in the United States and was a top 20 hit in the United Kingdom."@en ;

The album's style was highly similar to Parliament-Funkadelic as the band was working with and being produced by both Parliament members William Earl \"Bootsy\" Collins and George Clinton during the album's production. The Troutman family of the Zapp band had close ties with the Collins family, both being Ohio natives. This friendship proved instrumental in Zapp gaining a record deal with Warner Bros. Records in 1979. Zapp was recorded between late 1979 and early 1980 at the United Sound Studios in Detroit Michigan, the studio of which Parliament-Funkadelic frequented. The album was released on July 28, 1980 on Warner Bros. Records and was certified gold by November 1980, reaching number 2 on the Billboard Hot R&B tracks chart in the Autumn of 1980 for 2 weeks. The album has been cited as one of the definitive albums of early 80s electronic funk, bringing the genre into mainstream attention. The album has also served as a partial source toward the creation of the G-funk sound of Hip-Hop, which was popular on the West coast of the United States during the early to mid 1990's.

	dbo:abstract	"The Living End is the self-titled debut studio album by Australian punk, rockabilly band The Living End, which was released on 12 October 1998. It was recorded at Sing Sing Studios in Melbourne with Lindsay Gravina producing for Modular Recordings. The cover art, as described by front man Chris Cheney, is based on a photograph of a World War I all-female bomb factory. The album reached No. 1 on the ARIA Albums Chart and remained in the top 50 for 63 weeks. The Living End had achieved mainstream success with the extended play, Second Solution / Prisoner of Society released in September 1997. It peaked at No. 4 on the ARIA Singles Chart. In early 1998 the related single, \"Prisoner of Society\", was released in the United Kingdom and, the following year, in the United States. Other charting Australian singles are \"Save the Day\" (September 1998) and \"All Torn Down\" (December). The sixth album track, \"Monday\", is The Living End's epitaph to the 1996 Dunblane massacre. In December 1999 The Living End was certified 4\u00D7 Platinum by Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) for shipment of 280,000 units. In October 2010 it was listed in the book, 100 Best Australian Albums. As of July 2012 it is the band's most successful album."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Boston is the debut studio album by Boston-based American rock band Boston. Produced by Tom Scholz and John Boylan, the album was released on August 25, 1976, in the United States by Epic Records. Scholz had first begun playing music in the late 1960s after graduating from MIT with a master's degree, which led to a senior position at Polaroid. After being involved in the Boston music scene for several years, Scholz concentrated on demos recorded in his apartment basement with singer Brad Delp. His previous group, Mother's Milk, had received numerous rejection letters from major record labels in the early 1970s. By 1975, the demo tape had fallen into the hands of CBS-owned Epic Records, who signed the band. Epic wanted the band to record in Los Angeles with a record producer, but Scholz was unwilling and wanted to record the album in his basement studio, so he hired Boylan to run interference with the label. In an elaborate ruse, Scholz tricked the label into thinking the band was recording on the West Coast, when in reality, the bulk was being tracked solely by Scholz at his Massachusetts home. The album's contents are a complete recreation of the band's demo tape, and contain songs written and composed many years prior. The album's style, often referred to as the \"Boston sound\", was developed through Scholz's love of classical music, melodic hooks and guitar-heavy rock groups such as the Kinks and the Yardbirds. The album was first issued by Epic in August 1976 and sold extremely well, breaking sales records and becoming one of the best-selling debut albums of all time. Boston's style was appropriated by label executives and imitated by bands to create radio-friendly \"corporate rock\", the creation of which the band was also accused. The album's singles, most notably \"More Than a Feeling\" and \"Long Time\", were both AM and FM hits, and nearly the entire album receives constant rotation on classic rock radio. The album has been referred to as a landmark in 1970s rock and has been included on many lists of essential albums. The album has sold 17 million copies in the United States alone and 25 million worldwide."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Achtung Baby (/\u02C8\u0251\u02D0xtu\u02D0\u014B \u02C8be\u026Abi\u02D0/) is the seventh studio album by Irish rock band U2. It was produced by Daniel Lanois and Brian Eno, and was released on 19 November 1991 on Island Records. Stung by criticism of their 1988 release, Rattle and Hum, U2 shifted their musical direction to incorporate influences from alternative rock, industrial music, and electronic dance music into their sound. Thematically, Achtung Baby is darker, more introspective, and at times more flippant than their previous work. The album and the subsequent multimedia-intensive Zoo TV Tour were central to the group's 1990s reinvention, by which they abandoned their earnest public image for a more lighthearted and self-deprecating one. Seeking inspiration from German reunification, U2 began recording Achtung Baby at Berlin's Hansa Studios in October 1990. The sessions were fraught with conflict, as the band argued over their musical direction and the quality of their material. After tensions and slow progress nearly prompted the group to break up, they made a breakthrough with the improvised writing of the song \"One\". Morale and productivity improved during subsequent recording sessions in Dublin, where the album was completed in 1991. To confound the public's expectations of the band and their music, U2 chose the record's facetious title and colourful multi-image sleeve. Achtung Baby is one of U2's most successful records; it received favourable reviews and debuted at number one on the US Billboard 200 Top Albums, while topping the charts in many other countries. Five songs were released as commercial singles, all of which were chart successes, including \"One\", \"Mysterious Ways\", and \"The Fly\". The album has sold 18 million copies worldwide and won a Grammy Award in 1993 for Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal. Achtung Baby has since been acclaimed by writers and music critics as one of the greatest albums of all time. The record was reissued in October 2011 to commemorate the 20th anniversary of its original release."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Divine Intervention is the sixth studio album by American thrash metal band Slayer. Released on September 27, 1994, through American Recordings, it was their first album to feature Paul Bostaph, replacing the band's original drummer Dave Lombardo. The production posed a challenge to the record company, as its marketing situation drew arguments over the album's explicitness. The band used the Decade of Aggression live album to give them time to decide the album's style. Since it was released nearly four years after Seasons in the Abyss, vocalist Tom Araya said that there was more time spent on production compared to the band's previous albums. The cover was painted and designed by Wes Benscoter as a re-imaging of the group's early \"Slayergram\" graphic. Even though so much time was spent on production, Kerry King said that the mixing and mastering should have had more attention. The song's origins came not only from television shows, but were also inspired by various other things, including Rush Limbaugh, and serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer. Araya stated that the album \"came out of the past four years of hating life.\" In 1998 the album was banned in Germany due to the lyrics of \"SS-3\", \"Circle of Beliefs\", \"Serenity in Murder\", \"213\" and \"Mind Control\".[citation needed] Divine Intervention received mixed reviews by critics. The album sold 93,000 copies in its first week. It peaked number eight on the Billboard 200 and charted at number 15 on UK Albums Chart. It was rewarded gold in the United States and Canada.

It saw the band moving in more of an overt synthpop direction, even though guitars still played a prominent role. The album was co-produced by Robert Margouleff, famous for his synthesizer work in Tonto's Expanding Head Band and with Stevie Wonder. It contains Devo's biggest hit song, \"Whip It.\" According to the band's commentary on the The Complete Truth About De-Evolution DVD, the lyrics of \"Whip It\" began as a tongue-in-cheek anthem for then-president Jimmy Carter. The lyrics were also inspired by Norman Vincent Peale's 1952 book The Power of Positive Thinking and the \"can do philosophy\" espoused within. Devo bassist and co-songwriter Jerry Casale also told Songfacts that the lyrics were written by him \"as an imitation of Thomas Pynchon's parodies in his book Gravity's Rainbow.\" \"Mr. B's Ballroom\" is a lyric re-written version of an earlier relationship-focused song called \"Luv & Such,\" which can be heard on the Rhino Entertainment two-disc rarities collection Recombo DNA. The lyric of \"That's Pep!\" is an early 20th-century poem by Grace G. Bostwick. In 1995, the band recorded a new version of \"Girl U Want\" for the film Tank Girl. An entire alternate demo version of Freedom of Choice was released in 2000 on the compilation album Recombo DNA. This demo version lacks \"It's Not Right,\" \"Ton o' Luv,\" \"Don't You Know\" and \"Freedom of Choice,\" but it includes demos of the \"Whip It\" b-side \"Turn Around\" and three unreleased tracks (\"Luv & Such,\" \"Time Bomb\" and \"Make Me Move\").

Many of the album's lyrics were written in response to the War on Terror and the resurgence of right-wing politics in the West after the turn of the millennium. Songwriter and vocalist Thom Yorke said the album expresses \"frustration and powerlessness and anger, and the huge gap between the people that put themselves in control and the people that allegedly voted for them.\" Despite a high-profile internet leak ten weeks before its release, Hail to the Thief debuted at number one in the United Kingdom and number three in the United States. It produced three charting singles: \"There There\", \"Go to Sleep\" and \"2 + 2 = 5\". It is certified platinum in the UK, Canada and the US.

	dbo:abstract	"Man in the Hills is a reggae album by Jamaican musician Burning Spear (Winston Rodney), released in 1976 (see 1976 in music) on Island Records. Man in the Hills was follow-up to the seminal Marcus Garvey; Man in the Hills is usually considered a worthy follow-up, though less innovative and incendiary. produced by Jack Ruby, Man in the Hills is a simple and unadorned album, with songs that reminisce about Spear's childhood in St. Anne's Bay, Jamaica. \"Door Peep\" was originally recorded in 1969 at Studio One after Spear ran into Bob Marley (also from St. Anne's Bay); Spear later quotes Marley \"And Bob was going to his farm. The man was moving with a donkey and some buckets and a fork, and cutlass and plants. We just reason man-to-man and I-man say wherein I would like to get involved in the music business. And Bob say, 'All right, just check Studio One.' \" The single was released but fared poorly on the Jamaican charts. After Marcus Garvey, Spear's fame had grown considerably, and he was a star in Jamaica and cult sensation in the United Kingdom. Man in the Hills was a much quieter and more restrained album than its predecessor, and was more astoral and dreamlike than militant and radical (though songs like \"Is It Good\" and \"No More War\" continue to address social issues). \"Man in the Hills\", the titular album opener evokes the superiority of rural living over urban. In Jamaican history, the roots of radical protest, a national identity and the Rastafari movement, grew from communities formed by escaped slaves in the hills and (after emancipation in 1838) the so-called \"Free Villages\"."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"The Joshua Tree is the fifth studio album by rock band U2. It was produced by Daniel Lanois and Brian Eno, and was released on 9 March 1987 on Island Records. In contrast to the ambient experimentation of their 1984 release The Unforgettable Fire, the band aimed for a harder-hitting sound within the limitation of conventional song structures on The Joshua Tree. The album is influenced by American and Irish roots music, and depicts the band's love\u2013hate relationship with the United States, using socially and politically conscious lyrics embellished with spiritual imagery. Inspired by American tour experiences, literature, and politics, U2 chose America as a theme for the record. Recording began in January 1986 in Ireland, and to foster a relaxed, creative atmosphere, the group recorded in two houses, in addition to two professional studios. Several events during the sessions helped shape the conscious tone of the album, including the band's participation in A Conspiracy of Hope tour, the death of roadie Greg Carroll, and lead vocalist Bono's travels to Central America. Recording was completed in November 1986; additional production continued into January 1987. Throughout the sessions, U2 sought a \"cinematic\" quality for the record, one that would evoke a sense of location, in particular, the open spaces of America. They represented this in the sleeve photography depicting them in American desert landscapes. The Joshua Tree received critical acclaim, topped the charts in over 20 countries, and sold in record-breaking numbers. According to Rolling Stone, the album increased the band's stature \"from heroes to superstars\". It produced the hit singles \"With or Without You\", \"I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For\", and \"Where the Streets Have No Name\". The album won Grammy Awards for Album of the Year and Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal in 1988. The group supported the record with the Joshua Tree Tour throughout 1987. Frequently featured on critics' lists of music's greatest records, The Joshua Tree is one of the world's best-selling albums, with over 25 million copies sold. U2 released a remastered edition of the record in 2007 to commemorate its 20th anniversary. In 2014, it was deemed \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\" by the US Library of Congress and selected for preservation in the National Recording Registry."@en ;

The album's title came from a friend hearing the first song they had written for the album, which would become the title track.

	dbo:abstract	"Electric Tepee is the seventeenth studio album by the English space rock group Hawkwind, released in 1992. It spent one week on the UK albums chart at #53. After a European tour in March and April 1991, long-standing keyboardist Harvey Bainbridge chose to leave the group. Female singer Bridget Wishart would also end her association with the group in September. The group would go on to operate as a three piece of guitarist Dave Brock, bassist Alan Davey and drummer Richard Chadwick, making heavy use of sequencers, synthesisers and computers, both in the studio and live. The album was recorded in 1992 at Brock's own Earth Studios, produced with Paul Cobbold. \"Mask of the Morning\" re-uses the lyrics from \"Mirror of Illusion\" from the 1970 debut album Hawkwind. \"Rites of Netherworld\" is a brief keyboard piece based on Igor Stravinsky's The Rite of Spring. The group undertook a 23 date UK tour in April and May to promote the album, appearing behind a curtain on which the lightshow was projected. An all-nighter at the Brixton Academy on 15 August, when they were joined on-stage by Salt Tank, was amateur video recorded and released as Brixton Academy 15.8.92."@en ;

The album spawned the R&B number #1 single in \"Flash Light\", which features a funky synthesizer bass line played in a Minimoog by keyboardist Bernie Worrell. The album became Parliament's fourth consecutive gold album and second platinum album. The song \"Sir Nose d'Voidoffunk (Pay Attention - B3M)\" contains nursery rhymes \"Baa, Baa, Black Sheep\" and \"Three Blind Mice\", the lyrics were changed to make reference to drug use. The original vinyl release contained a 22\" by 33\" inch poster of the character \"Sir Nose D'Voidoffunk\", as well as an 8-page comic book that explains the concept behind the LP.

It was produced between the band's touring commitments, from January to August 1971. The album was recorded at a series of locations around London, including Abbey Road Studios and Morgan Studios. With no material to work with and no clear idea of the album's direction, the group devised a series of novel experiments which eventually inspired the album's signature track, \"Echoes\". Although many of the band's later albums would be unified by a central theme with lyrics written mainly by Roger Waters, Meddle was a group effort with lyrical contributions from each member, and is considered a transitional album between the Syd Barrett-influenced group of the late 1960s and the emerging Pink Floyd. The cover, incorporating a close-up shot of an ear underwater was, as with several previous albums, designed by Hipgnosis, though Storm Thorgerson was unhappy with the final result. The album was well received by music critics upon its release. However, despite being commercially successful in the United Kingdom, lackluster publicity on the part of their United States-based label led to poor sales there upon initial release."@en ;

The album was initially known as The Manson Family Album \u2013 a direct reference to serial killer Charles Manson's own band \u2013 but was retitled prior to release. It is the only Marilyn Manson studio album to feature bassist Gidget Gein. Gein was fired from the band after its production following a very public and destructive heroin addiction and Twiggy Ramirez, the band's roadie and friend of Gein and Manson, was put as a temporary replacement while Gein got clean and sober. He eventually took over Gein's place and briefly adopted his image. Contrary to popular belief, Ramirez did not play bass on the album. Though Sara Lee Lucas was the featured drummer on the album, Nine Inch Nails live keyboardist Charlie Clouser used a drum machine to replace the work Lucas did. Daisy Berkowitz helped compose music for all of the songs except \"Prelude (The Family Trip)\" and \"Sweet Tooth.\" The album was certified Gold on May 29, 2003 by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) in the United States.

It was recorded at locations in the Bahamas and the United States between July and August 1980 and was produced by the quartet's long-time collaborator Brian Eno. The album peaked at number 19 on the Billboard 200 in the US and at number 21 on the UK Albums Chart. Two singles were released from Remain in Light: \"Once in a Lifetime\" and \"Houses in Motion\" as well as promotional single \"Crosseyed and Painless\". The record was certified Gold in the US and in Canada during the 1980s. The members of Talking Heads wanted to make an album that dispelled notions of frontman and chief lyricist David Byrne leading a back-up band. They decided to experiment with African polyrhythms and, with Eno, recorded the instrumental tracks as a series of samples and loops, a novel idea at the time. Additional musicians were frequently used throughout the studio sessions. The lyric writing process slowed Remain in Light's progress, but was concluded after Byrne drew inspiration from academic literature on Africa. The artwork for the album's cover was crafted with the help of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's computers and designing company M&Co. Following the album's completion, Talking Heads expanded to nine members for promotional concerts. Remain in Light was widely acclaimed by critics. Praise centred on its cohesive merging of disparate genres and sonic experimentation. The record has been featured in several publications' lists of the best albums of the 1980s and the best albums of all time, and it is often considered Talking Heads' magnum opus. In 2006, it was remastered and reissued with the addition of four unfinished outtakes."@en ;

It was to be the last album to feature founding member Miroslav Vitou\u0161 as the primary bassist. Zawinul began to assert greater control of band, steering it away from the collective improvisation that marked its live performances toward more structured compositions emphasizing funk and groove. This was exemplified by the album\u2019s two dominant tracks, \u201CBoogie Woogie Waltz\u201D and \u201C125th Street Congress,\u201D as well as the closer, \u201CNon-Stop Home.\u201D Other tracks were reminiscent of Weather Report\u2019s previous albums. Sweetnighter is considered to be the most stylistically transitional release by the band as it bridged the gap between the more open, improvisational earlier style to a more compositionally structured format. Also, the more prominent use of electric bass is evident here. Zawinul had taken the decision to add some funky beats in the band's sounds, so he recruited drummer Herschel Dwellingham and percussionist Muruga Booker to play on the album. Andrew White was hired to play the English horn, but also handled the bass for three tracks of the album. Sweetnighter was recorded at a Connecticut recording studio in less than a week, and was released in April 1973."@en ;

dbr:The_Execution_of_All_Things	rdf:type	schema:MusicAlbum ;
	dbo:abstract	"The Execution of All Things is the second full-length album released by Los Angeles-based indie pop band Rilo Kiley. Expanding on their previous musical sound that mostly incorporated guitars, vocals, percussion and pianos, the album contains heavy electronica sampling mixed into the songs in a rather unusual and displaced-sounding way. Also, unlike their previous tracks which were written in very traditional manners, the lyrics to the songs on Execution are very wordy and read like prose. Musically, the record has a very sunny disposition, with bouncing bass lines and simple melodies complemented by lead singer Jenny Lewis's vocal style, but the upbeat music is generally counterpointed by the often dark and morose subject matter that the lyrics reference. The album was recorded at Saddle Creek Records in Omaha, Nebraska, and the aforementioned features show the influence of that studio's associated Omaha Sound. The album is also strung together by a song that is broken into pieces and that trails between several tracks. Called \"And That's How I Choose to Remember It\", it tells the story of Lewis' childhood and her parents' divorce. This theme is visited throughout the album, which is lyrically filled with childhood recollections of loss, displacement, anger and hopelessness. The songs \"So Long\" and \"Three Hopeful Thoughts\" feature lead vocals by Blake Sennett. Lewis sings lead on all other tracks. The song \"With Arms Outstretched\" played in the final moments of the series finale of Weeds, just as it had in the pilot. The song \"A Better Son/Daughter\" was played in the trailer for the first season of the Netflix original series Orange Is the New Black This album is the 47th release of Saddle Creek Records."@en ;

Thunder Seven was the last Triumph album that did not feature any outside writers. All prior Triumph albums, with the exception of 1977's Rock and Roll Machine, were written entirely by the band members."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Antichrist Superstar is the second full-length studio album by American rock band Marilyn Manson. Released on October 8, 1996 in the US through Nothing and Interscope Records, the album debuted at No. 3 on the Billboard 200 which launched the band into mainstream success. This, allied with the band's uncompromisingly anti-Christian stance and transgressive performances, led to picketing and numerous protests from religious and civic groups. The album displayed a more musically cohesive and developed sound than any of their previous releases. According to Rolling Stone magazine, the album's release marked the end of the grunge era in popular music. As a rock opera and a concept album, it was the first installment in a trilogy which included succeeding releases 1998's Mechanical Animals and 2000's Holy Wood (In the Shadow of the Valley of Death). After the release of Holy Wood, Manson said that the overarching story within the trilogy is presented in reverse chronological order; Antichrist Superstar, therefore, is the finale despite being the first to be chronologically released. It was recorded at Nothing Studios in New Orleans and produced by Trent Reznor of Nine Inch Nails. The album has sold over 7 million copies worldwide, with 1.9 million of those sold in the United States alone. It spawned two commercial singles (\"The Beautiful People\" and \"Tourniquet\"), and an autobiography (The Long Hard Road Out of Hell). The band supported the album with the controversial Dead to the World Tour. In the years since its release, it has been heralded by numerous publications as a modern classic and essential listening."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Blink-182 is the eponymously titled fifth studio album by American pop-punk band Blink-182. It was produced by Jerry Finn and released November 18, 2003, through Geffen Records. Following the band's ascent to stardom and success of their prior two releases, the trio were compelled to take a break and subsequently participated in various side projects (Box Car Racer and Transplants). When they regrouped, the band felt inspired to approach song structure and arrangements differently on their next effort together. The record was left untitled as to refrain from labeling its content, and its packaging features a \"smiley face\" logo inspired by pop art. Recorded throughout 2003, Blink-182 marks a departure from the band's earlier work, infusing experimental elements into their usual pop punk sound, inspired by lifestyle changes (the band members all became fathers before the album was released) and side projects. Its songs are characterized by downcast and expansive sonic atmospheres, showcasing what critics dubbed a more elaborate, mature side of the band. Songwriting is more personal in nature and explores darker territory, touching upon the realities of adulthood and unexpected hardships. The record features a collaboration with The Cure frontman Robert Smith. Fans were generally split regarding the band's \"new\" direction, but the record proved successful, selling 2.2 million copies in the United States. The album received positive reviews, with critics welcoming the change in tone. Lead singles \"Feeling This\" and \"I Miss You\" received the most radio airplay of the four singles released and peaked high on Billboard charts. The worldwide touring schedule, which saw the band travel to Japan and Australia, also found the three performing for troops stationed in the Middle East. Blink-182 was the band's last recording with longtime producer Jerry Finn and their final original material before a four-year-long hiatus."@en ;

Based on a short story written by lead singer Cedric Bixler-Zavala and sound manipulation artist Jeremy Michael Ward, the concept album is an hour-long tale of Cerpin Taxt, a man who enters a week-long coma after overdosing on a mixture of morphine and rat poison. The story of Cerpin Taxt alludes to the death of El Paso, Texas artist \u2014 and Bixler-Zavala's friend \u2014 Julio Venegas (1972\u20131996). Co-produced by Rick Rubin and guitarist Omar Rodriguez-Lopez, it is the only studio album to feature founding member Jeremy Michael Ward, who was found dead in an apparent heroin overdose one month before the album was released. Following the departure of Eva Gardner, Red Hot Chili Peppers bassist Flea occupied the role of bass guitarist on this album. The music contained in De-Loused is distinguished by its enigmatic lyrics, Latin and jazz rhythms, and Omar Rodr\u00EDguez-L\u00F3pez's frenetic guitar riffs, which are often strongly dissonant. The title of this album is taken from the lyrics of the song \"Eunuch Provocateur\" on the band's previous release, Tremulant. The cover artwork is by Storm Thorgerson."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"In Utero is the third and final studio album by the American rock band Nirvana, released on September 21, 1993, by DGC Records. Nirvana intended the record to diverge significantly from the polished production of its previous album, Nevermind (1991). To capture a more abrasive and natural sound, the group hired engineer Steve Albini to record In Utero during a two-week period in February 1993 at Pachyderm Studio in Cannon Falls, Minnesota. The music was recorded quickly with few studio embellishments, and the song lyrics and album packaging incorporated medical imagery that conveyed frontman Kurt Cobain's outlook on his publicized personal life and his band's newfound fame. Soon after recording was completed, rumors circulated in the press that DGC might not release the album in its original state, as the record label felt that the result was not commercially viable. Although Nirvana publicly denied the statements, the group was not fully satisfied with the sound Albini had captured. Albini declined to alter the album further, and ultimately the band hired R.E.M. producer Scott Litt to make minor changes to the album's sound and remix the singles \"Heart-Shaped Box\" and \"All Apologies\". Upon release, In Utero entered the Billboard 200 chart at number one and received critical acclaim as a drastic departure from Nevermind. The record has been certified five times platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America, and has sold 15 million copies worldwide."@en ;

Lennon was being sued by Morris Levy over copyright infringement of one line in his song \"Come Together\". As part of an agreement, Lennon had to include three Levy-owned songs on Rock 'n' Roll. Spector ran away with the session recordings, later being involved in a motor accident, which left the album's tracks unrecoverable until the beginning of the Walls and Bridges sessions.

	dbo:abstract	"A Picture of Nectar is the third official studio album and first on a major-label by the American rock band Phish, released on February 18, 1992, through Elektra Records. The album is dedicated to Nector Rorris, the proprietor of Nectar's in Burlington, Vermont, where Phish played their first bar gig followed by a series of monthly three-night stands, saying that the experience \"taught us how to play\". There are two versions of the album's cover. The first printings of the CD were issued in longbox format, and the title of the album was not printed on the CD insert itself. Later printings came in shrink-wrap format and had the band's name and album title printed directly on the insert. The songs on A Picture of Nectar explore a variety of musical genres, including jazz, country, calypso, rock and roll and neo-psychedelia. Tracks 2, 8, and 9 are instrumentals. The song \"Manteca\" is a cover of the song by jazz trumpeter Dizzy Gillespie; in Phish's short version, the melody line is sung as a goofy nonsense phrase. \"Poor Heart\" is written in bluegrass style. All songs on the album have been performed live by the band, though the instrumental tracks have become relative rarities after the mid-1990s. The short instrumental, \"Faht\", written by drummer Jon Fishman, has only been performed live twelve times, the last in 1995. Several live versions of \"Catapult\" have been performed in the middle of another song, such as \"Run Like an Antelope\", \"David Bowie\" and \"Simple\".[citation needed] The album was certified gold by the RIAA on November 15, 2001."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"All That You Can't Leave Behind is the tenth studio album by rock band U2. It was produced by Brian Eno and Daniel Lanois, and was released on 30 October 2000 on Island Records in the United Kingdom and Interscope Records in the United States. Following the mixed reception to their 1997 album, Pop, All That You Can't Leave Behind represented a return to a more mainstream sound for the band after they experimented with alternative rock and dance music in the 1990s. At the time of the album's release, U2 said on several occasions that they were \"reapplying for the job ... [of] the best band in the world\". U2 brought back Eno and Lanois, who had produced three of the band's previous albums. The album was originally named \"U2000\", which had been a working title for their PopMart Tour. All That You Can't Leave Behind received favourable reviews from critics and sold over 12 million copies. The songs \"Beautiful Day\", \"Walk On\", \"Elevation\", and \"Stuck in a Moment You Can't Get Out Of\" were all successful singles. The record and its songs won seven Grammy Awards; it is the only album in history to have multiple tracks win the Grammy Award for Record of the Year: \"Beautiful Day\" in 2001 and \"Walk On\" in 2002. In 2003, the album was ranked number 139 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of \"The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time\", but it was re-ranked at number 280 in 2012."@en ;

dbr:Dogg_Food	rdf:type	schema:MusicAlbum ;
	dbo:abstract	"Dogg Food is the first studio album by the American hip hop group Tha Dogg Pound. Its controversial lyrics were the subject of shareholder protest. (The album was supposed to be released in July 1995. As a result of the controversy from Time Warner, the release was delayed for three months.) Two singles were released from the album, \"Let's Play House\" and \"New York, New York\", featuring Nate Dogg and Snoop Doggy Dogg, respectively. It reached the top of the Billboard 200 chart with first-week sales of 277,500. Though it eventually sold over 2 million records (2\u00D7 Platinum), Dogg Food did not equal the success of preceding Death Row Records releases (The Chronic and Doggystyle). It is one of the last high-selling and critically acclaimed releases from the label, preceding only Tha Doggfather and 2Pac's albums as an anticipated album, and is the last album to be \"officially\" produced under the G-Funk (subgenre) era of hip-hop. The original title for the album was going to be called \"After All Thiz Shit Look at Uz Now\", but Daz's cousin Joe Cool kindly changed the name to Dogg Food (in slang for heroin). Though Dr. Dre was Death Row's top producer, the album was mostly produced by Dat Nigga Daz. Dr. Dre mixed the album. Dogg Food led the way for Daz to become the top in-house producer for Death Row until his departure in the late 1990s. In the months leading up to the album's release, Kurupt appeared on BETRapCity and announced that \"Reality\" (a song that features Tray Dee) would be the lead single for the album. However, this song was never released as a single. The video for the second single, \"New York, New York\", caused some controversy when Snoop appeared in it kicking down buildings throughout New York. This led to a response record by Capone-N-Noreaga, Mobb Deep and Tragedy Khadafi called \"L.A., L.A.\", with a music video in which impersonated Dogg Pound members were thrown from the Queensboro Bridge. The trailer of the Dogg Pound was also shot at during the process of making the \"New York, New York\" video. The song is one of three tracks on the album not produced by Daz, as DJ Pooh provided the beat. The opening track contains a line of disrespect towards the rival rap group Bone Thugs-N-Harmony, as Kurupt raps, \"Ain't got no love for no hoes in harmony,\" picking up from the earlier row between the Dogg Pound mentor Dr. Dre and Bone's mentor Eazy-E. This is consistent with most of the Death Row releases up to this point, as the Chronic contains the Eazy E insults on tracks 1 and 2, Snoop's Doggystyle contains them in a conversation (skit) with Daz, and the Murder Was The Case album contains a Ruthless slight in the track \"What Would You Do?\". The track \"I Don't Like To Dream About Gettin' Paid\" is a remake of an original track recorded by 213 (Snoop, Nate, Warren G) before they were famous, and Nate Dogg appears in the chorus of the track. 213 had two underground songs (\"I Don't Like To Dream About Gettin' Paid\" and \"Long Beach is A Mutherfucka\") that are still rare and unreleased. In the original tracklist, \"U Can't Cee Me\" featuring George Clinton and produced by Dr Dre, was the 8th track of the album. This song was deleted. This first tracklist come from on a promo paper titled \"Dogg Food : Ingredients\" in 1995 where the song is listed \"Can't Cee Me\" (Self-Explanatory, featuring George Clinton). The song was later given to 2Pac who recorded his album All Eyez On Me when Tha Dogg Pound album was going to be released."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Janet Jackson's Rhythm Nation 1814 is the fourth studio album by American recording artist Janet Jackson, released on September 19, 1989, by A&M Records. Although label executives wanted material similar to her previous album, Control (1986), Jackson insisted on creating a concept album addressing social issues. Collaborating with songwriters and record producers Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis, she drew inspiration from various tragedies reported through news media, exploring racism, poverty, and substance abuse, in addition to themes of romance. Although its primary concept was met with mixed reactions, its composition received critical acclaim. Jackson came to be considered a role model for youth because of her socially conscious lyrics. Noted for its use of sample loop and utilizing swing note and synthesized percussion throughout its production, the album encompasses a variety of musical styles, such as new jack swing, hard rock, pop, dance and industrial music. The songs range from mechanized dance rhythms to soft balladry, giving it appeal across multiple radio formats. It became the singer's second consecutive album to reach number one on the Billboard 200 albums chart in the United States. It also topped the ARIA Charts in Australia and peaked within the top ten positions of the album charts in Japan, New Zealand, and United Kingdom. Certified six-times platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), it emerged the biggest-selling album of 1990 and has sold an estimated twenty million copies worldwide. Due to its innovative production and lyrical exploration, critics have come to regard it as the pinnacle of Jackson's artistic achievement. It is included in Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time and the British reference book 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die, among other publications \"best of\" album lists. It has been cited as an influence in various musical trends, inspiring numerous artists. It is the only album in the history of the US Billboard Hot 100 singles chart to have seven commercial singles peak within the top five positions. It is also the only album to produce number one hits on the chart in three separate calendar years (1989\u20131991). The 30-minute Rhythm Nation 1814 film, a screenplay depicting two aspiring musicians whose lives are disrupted by substance abuse, aired on MTV to promote the album. Jackson received nine Grammy Award nominations, becoming the first female artist to be nominated for Producer of the Year and winning Best Long Form Music Video for Rhythm Nation 1814. Her Rhythm Nation World Tour 1990 became the most successful debut concert tour by a recording artist, in addition to setting venue records in Japan. She was regarded as a fashion icon, with her \"Rhythm Nation\" attire being emulated by youth. Proceeds from the tour were used to establish the Rhythm Nation Scholarship and fund other educational programs. Jackson received the MTV Video Vanguard Award and a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for her significant contributions to popular culture."@en ;

The album was independently recorded at Euphoria Sound Studio, now known as Sound & Vision Media, in Revere, MA by engineer Gordon Hookailo. Some of the recording was documented on video tape by studio owner Howard Cook. The recording was released on tape in 1988, and did not appear in stores officially until May 8, 1989. The album was re-released by Elektra Records on October 26, 1992. The album is named after Ben \"Junta\" Hunter, the band's first official manager/agent, whose nickname is pronounced with a \"hard\" J and a \"short\" U. In addition to a few more traditionally structured songs, Junta contains symphonic-like epics and multi-part progressive rock suites. The album was certified gold by the RIAA on October 9, 1997, and was certified platinum on July 7, 2004. In February 2009, this album became available as a download in FLAC and MP3 formats from LivePhish.com. On February 13, 2012, it was announced that Junta would be released on vinyl for the first time on April 21, 2012 as Limited Edition Deluxe 3-LP vinyl set, as part of Record Store Day. The LE Deluxe 3-LP vinyl set is limited to 5,000 individually numbered copies. The vinyl release was created from the original stereo master reels with lacquers cut by Chris Bellman at Bernie Grundman Mastering, and pressed onto 180g audiophile grade vinyl and includes a free MP3 download of the entire album (transferred from the new vinyl master). Chris Bellman also made two digital transfers from the original stereo master reels, one recorded at 24 bit / 96 kHz, and a second digital transfer recorded at 24 bit / 192 kHz. These digital files were sold at HDTracks. On this new release \"Contact\" is over a minute longer than in previous releases. \"Union Federal\", \"Sanity\", and \"Icculus\" did not appear on the original cassette release, but rather only on the Elektra version, which had extra space on the CD format. \"Union Federal\" was taken from a jam session, while \"Sanity\" and \"Icculus\" were recorded live on July 25, 1988. There was a mix up in adding them to the Elektra version post-date, so the May 3, 1988 date inside the album notes is incorrect. The 2009 LivePhish.com digital download also contained these three extra tracks, while the 2012 re-releases did not contain the extra tracks, as these were not part of the original album's stereo master reels."@en ;

Vinyl LPs of the original Absolute A Go Go release are still known to circulate. The album was later re-mastered by Bob Ludwig and re-released on CD and cassette by Elektra Records June 30, 1992. The songs on Lawn Boy include many of the progressive rock and fusion elements featured on the band's first studio album, Junta, as well as incorporating elements of bluegrass, jazz and barbershop quartet. According to Phish Archivist Kevin Shapiro: Lawn Boy was recorded and mixed at Archer Studios in Winooski, VT in 1989 and 1990 on 16-track 2\" tape and was mixed to 1/4\" stereo reels. The band won the initial studio time with a first-place Rock Rumble performance on April 21, 1989 at a downtown Burlington, VT club called The Front. The Lawn Boy sessions that followed consisted of mostly live takes with a few effects and overdubs. Engineer Dan Archer acquired a baby grand piano specifically for the recording, Fishman played his drums squeezed into a vocal isolation booth and the band utilized local musicians including members of what would soon be called the Giant Country Horns. Like Junta before it, Phish self-produced Lawn Boy on a hands-on level, surrounding the console for group fades without aid of automation. The album was certified gold by the RIAA on July 7, 2004. In February 2009, Lawn Boy became available as a download in FLAC and MP3 formats at LivePhish.com. JEMP Records released \"Lawn Boy\" on Record Store Day 2013 as a Limited Edition Deluxe 2-LP vinyl set.

It runs the gamut from pure power-pop songs, such as \"Bangs\" and \"Finished With Lies\", to dance music (\"Man, It's So Loud In Here\"), and soft romantic ballads (\"Another First Kiss\"). \"Man, It's So Loud in Here\" was the only single released from the album, though its cover of the Georgie Fame oldie \"Yeh Yeh\" was featured in a Chrysler car commercial. \"Bangs,\" \"Cyclops Rock,\" \"Man, It's So Loud In Here,\" and \"Another First Kiss\", as well as \"Boss of Me\" (which was featured on non-U.S. releases), were released on the band's 2002 anthology compilation Dial-A-Song: 20 Years of They Might Be Giants. \"Bangs\" provided the inspiration for author Zadie Smith's short story \"The Girl with Bangs\". A complete cover album called Mink Car Cover was constructed in 2011 to raise funds for the FDNY Foundation in the wake of the tenth anniversary of the terrorist attacks that occurred on the day of the album's original release. It featured covers by 19 different artists including Marian Call, The Doubleclicks, Hello, The Future!, and Molly Lewis."@en ;

Green Day commenced work on the record in January 2006 and forty-five songs were written by vocalist/guitarist Billie Joe Armstrong by October 2007, but the band members did not enter studio work until January 2008. The album was released May 15, 2009 through Reprise Records. Armstrong has described the album as a \"snapshot of the era in which we live as we question and try to make sense of the selfish manipulation going on around us, whether it be the government, religion, media or frankly any form of authority\". The singles \"Know Your Enemy\" and \"21 Guns\" exemplify the themes of alienation and politically motivated anger present in the record. Critical response to 21st Century Breakdown was generally positive. The record achieved Green Day's best chart performance to date, reaching number one on the album charts of various countries, including the United States Billboard 200, the European Top 100 Albums, and the United Kingdom Albums Chart.

This journey comes full circle on Belladonna, an instrumental record that captures the often tense emotional dynamics of Eno's pioneering releases. Dense textures evolve into delicate Mexican melodies, capturing the disquieting serenity of American southwest landscapes. This is Lanois' self-proclaimed defining moment. One track on the album, \"The Deadly Nightshade\", had earlier been released on a 1996 album by Geoffrey Oryema as \"LPJ Christine\", although the version on Belladonna is without Oryema's vocals."@en ;

In addition the harmony vocals on \"Blackman Redemption\" and \"Rastaman Live Up\" are performed by the I-Threes in order to give the album a consistent sound \u2013 on the original single versions they are performed by The Meditations. The most famous track on the album is \"Buffalo Soldier.\" Marley expressed the wish that \"I Know\" would be released as a single after his death, which Island Records did. Inside the album sleeve is an artist's depiction of the Battle of Adowa where Ethiopian forces defeated Italy in 1896. The cover of Confrontation is a reference to the story of St. George and the Dragon. The dragon on the cover represents Babylon, which is being slain by Bob Marley via his music."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Honky Tonk Angels is a 1993 Columbia Nashville album historically teaming country legends Dolly Parton, Loretta Lynn, and Tammy Wynette. Honky Tonk Angels was produced by Parton and Steve Buckingham. The album had been a long-rumored project between the country singers for over a decade and received much publicity and acclaim upon its release, although its only single release, a remake of the longtime country female vocalist staple \"Silver Threads and Golden Needles\", barely dented the charts (its accompanying video, however, received heavy rotation from CMT and TNN). Record sales, however, placed the album at #6 on Billboard's country album chart and #42 on Billboard 200, the pop album chart becoming Wynette's second-highest ranking album on the pop chart and Lynn's highest on the pop chart until her 2005 album Van Lear Rose. It was certified Gold by the Recording Industry Association of America.

	dbo:abstract	"The Beyond is the second studio album by Swedish post-metal band Cult of Luna, released in 2003. The subject matter is dissent with authorities, similar in some ways to contemporaries Isis' Panopticon. This album sees the rawness of the self-titled debut channeled into a cleaner sounding and more crisply produced sound. The tempo is slowed and the feeling is of a more expansive, reflective album, which almost bridges the gap between Cult of Luna and Salvation, leaning more towards the former (elements of which can be heard in \"Arrival\", \"Leash\" and \"Deliverance\", whilst \"Circle\" has the most similarity to the latter)."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"The Process is the eighth studio album by industrial band Skinny Puppy. Many factors complicated the recording of The Process. The album's producer changed multiple times, from Roli Mosimann to Martin Atkins to Dave Ogilvie. According to cEvin Key, their label, American Recordings, had pressured the band into adopting a more commercial sound or more Industrial metal sound similar to Nine Inch Nails. Following tensions between band members, Nivek Ogre left the band on June 12, 1995. American Recordings decided to drop Skinny Puppy after the release of The Process. The band's keyboardist, Dwayne Goettel, died of a heroin overdose shortly thereafter on August 23, 1995. Following Dwayne's death, cEvin and Dave completed mixing of The Process. The Process was intended to be a concept album about a psychotherapy cult from the 1960s known as The Process Church of the Final Judgement, which Ogre was introduced to by Genesis P. Orridge. At the time of its release, The Process was considered to be the final Skinny Puppy album; the liner notes simply say \"The End\" after the album credits. However, Ogre and Key reformed the band in 2000 and finally released in 2004 a new album, The Greater Wrong of the Right, eight years after the release of The Process. The cover art is by Steven R. Gilmore. The album was out of print for some time, but is now available in MP3 format."@en ;

It features two R&B #1 hits: \"Happy People\" (originally intended for recording by its authors, The Commodores), and \"Shakey Ground\", one of the group's final R&B #1 songs. The album features then-lead singer Dennis Edwards on the title track written by Leon Russell. Also featured are Richard Street and Melvin Franklin on the track \"Firefly\". A Song for You features a familiar device of the time used to exhibit the versatility of '70s soul groups: one side features up-tempo cuts and the other side focuses on ballads. Several songs on side one such as \"Glass House\" and \"Shakey Ground\" featured P-Funk-backed dance grooves and even a writing credit for former Funkadelic guitarist Eddie Hazel, while side two had tracks such as \"I'm a Bachelor\" and \"Memories\", which showcased a more subdued style of soul. This album, while it was initially panned by the Rolling Stone Record Guide, proved its worth, going gold (selling over 500,000 copies) and winning the 1976 American Music Award for Best R&B/Soul Album. This was also the final album by Eddie Kendricks's replacement Damon Harris, who was let go after this album. He would rejoin his Young Tempts bandmates as Impact."@en ;

dbr:A_Weekend_in_the_City	rdf:type	schema:MusicAlbum ;
	dbo:abstract	"A Weekend in the City is the second studio album by British indie rock band Bloc Party. It was recorded at Grouse Lodge Studios in Westmeath, Ireland, in mid-2006 and was produced by Jacknife Lee. The album was refined and mixed at several locations in London at the end of 2006. It was released on 24 January 2007 in Japan and in the first week of February in the rest of the world, with Wichita Recordings as the primary label. The album peaked at number two on the UK Albums Chart and on the Irish Albums Chart. In the United States, it entered the Billboard 200 at number 12. Bloc Party worked to craft an album that distanced them from the conventional guitar band set-up by incorporating more electronically processed beats and additional instrumentation. Computer programs were extensively used to enrich and amend recorded takes, while a string sextet was hired to perform on some of the tracks. The subject matter of frontman and chief lyricist Kele Okereke's lyrics for A Weekend in the City covers issues such as drug use, sexuality, and terrorism. The album's three original singles, \"The Prayer\", \"I Still Remember\", and \"Hunting for Witches\", address these themes respectively. Bloc Party's new musical directions and more forthright lyrics either impressed or alienated critics. Reviewers generally treated A Weekend in the City as an important stepping stone for the band members in their quest for musical maturity, while The Guardian included it in its list of the \"1000 Albums To Hear Before You Die\". In November 2007, the album was re-released globally\u2014with the final single, \"Flux\", as a bonus track\u2014to coincide with Bloc Party's extensive touring schedule."@en ;

The album's songs cover a variety of topics, with many referring to violence and drug use. There also several noise-based and experimental songs. Several songs consist solely of a vocal delivery of the title on top of noise, such as \"The Tokyo Subway Gassing\" and \"The Star of David\". The album is divided into several movements, some of which are titled. \"Wonder Drug Wonderland\", which is credited as track 00, can be found on the CD by holding rewind at the start of track 1. It is the first song on the LP. The cover art was created by Gaither. In late 2008, Altered States of America was re-issued as a two disc set with the second disc, titled ANbRx II: Delta 9, consisting of remixes from Chicago industrial/hardcore artist Delta 9. The song titles on the remix disc were inspired by the Merzbow/Gore Beyond Necropsy collaboration Rectal Anarchy."@en ;

It was recorded using the Manor Mobile at Pavillon du Hay, France, and mixed at The Manor, Oxfordshire, England. The album was produced by Gong under the direction of Giorgio Gomelsky. Angels Egg is the second in Gong's Radio Gnome Invisible trilogy of albums, following Flying Teapot and preceding You. The trilogy forms a central part of the Gong mythology. The original album did not have an apostrophe in the title. The original vinyl edition came with a booklet containing an extensive explanation of the mythology, including lyrics, a glossary of terms, and profiles of characters in the story and band members. This edition also had a gatefold cover (omitted in later pressings), a plain inky blue innersleeve to match the gatefold and booklet, and had the original black and white Virgin label that was discontinued after 1973; it was one of the last albums to use the original label. Some copies had a sticker over top of the female nude in the moon on the cover[citation needed]. The CD version released by Virgin Records, and later reissued on Charly Records contains an extra track: \"Ooby-Scooby Doomsday or The D-day DJ's Got the D.D.T. Blues\", that ends with a male voice choir glissando (questionably regarded by some as a parody on Pink Floyd's \"Echoes\"), starting with \"Ahhhh\" and ending with \"Chooo\", mimicking a sneeze. The track was originally released on the Live Etc. album but was excluded from the CD release (which reissued that double album as one disc), and included on this album instead."@en ;

The album is Aretha's first release for Columbia, and is also known under its working title Right Now It's Aretha and sometimes simply as Aretha. Following in the footsteps of close friend Sam Cooke, Aretha was \"discovered\" by famed Columbia Records producer John H. Hammond, who on the cover notes of the 1973 edition of \"The Great Aretha Franklin: The First 12 Sides\" mentions, that she was in fact recommended by the composer Curtis Reginald Lewis. With the support of her father, Reverend C.L. Franklin, Aretha venured out to New York City's Columbia Record Studios to record her debut album for the label. Hammond paired Aretha Franklin with the Ray Bryant combo and arranger J. Leslie McFarland, while taking charge of the album's production, which was received to mixed reviews. The album showcases a young Aretha Franklin (only 18 years old, at the time of these recordings), covering a range of jazz and pop standards. Columbia Records couldn't clearly classify Aretha's sound, as either jazz or R&B. Aretha's subsequent albums would show her moving from the realms of both sounds, and audiences as she tries to define her \"own soulful sound\". Though rare to find an original 6-eye pressing on vinyl, Columbia Records re-released these sessions and retitled them as \"The Great Aretha Franklin: The First 12 Sides\", in 1972. The exact same recording \"The Great Aretha Franklin: The First 12 Sides\", was once more re-released on vinyl, this time in 1973 by CBS/Embassy, trademarks of Columbia Records, probably being a UK edition, which on the center label bears these identification numbers: EMB S-31006 (KC 31953).

	dbo:abstract	"Arthur (Or the Decline and Fall of the British Empire) is the seventh studio album by English rock band the Kinks, released in October 1969. Kinks frontman Ray Davies constructed the concept album as the soundtrack to a Granada Television play and developed the storyline with novelist Julian Mitchell; however, the television programme was cancelled and never produced. The rough plot revolved around Arthur Morgan, a carpet-layer, who was based on Ray Davies' brother-in-law Arthur Anning. A mono version was released in the UK, but not in the US. It is now available on the 2011 deluxe-edition re-issue. Arthur was met with nearly unanimous acclaim upon release. It received generous coverage in the US rock press, with articles running in underground magazines such as Fusion and The Village Voice. It garnered back-to-back reviews by Mike Daly and Greil Marcus in Rolling Stone magazine's lead section; Daly rated it \"the Kinks' finest hour\", and Marcus ranked it \"the best British album of 1969\". Reviews in the UK were also positive. Although Arthur received a mixed review in New Musical Express, Disc & Music Echo praised the album's musical integrity, and Melody Maker called it \"Ray Davies' finest hour ... beautifully British to the core\". The album, although not very successful commercially, was a return to the charts in the US for the band. Their previous effort, The Kinks Are the Village Green Preservation Society, received acclaim from critics but failed to chart in any country upon its 1968 release, with total US sales estimated at under 25,000 copies. The Kinks returned to the Billboard charts in 1969 after a two-year absence, with the lead single from the record, \"Victoria\", peaking at number 62. The album itself reached number 50 on the Record World charts, and number 105 on Billboard, their highest position since 1965. It failed to chart in Britain. Arthur paved the way for the further success of their 1970 comeback album Lola Versus Powerman and the Moneygoround, Part One and its accompanying US Top 10 and UK Top 5 hit \"Lola\"."@en ;

Recorded after a short-living hiatus, it marked a departure from Klaws' previous work with Deutschland sucht den Superstar judge and musical mentor Dieter Bohlen, who gained no credit on the record. Instead, the album features a wider range of producers, including Terri Bjerre, David Stenmarck, Sandi Strmljan, Thorsten Br\u00F6tzmann, Ivo Moring, and Mirko von Schlieffen. The album reached the top twenty of the album charts in Austria and Germany, becoming the singer's lowest\u2013charting album then following the number-one success of his previous albums Take Your Chance (2003) and Here I Am (2004). Attention! spawned two singles, \"All (I Ever Want)\", the theme song to the musical The Three Musketeers, featuring vocals by German singer Sabrina Weckerlin and leading single \"Not like You\"."@en ;

The album is notable for the fact that Mann was initially without a record company and sold the album through her website, but the album went on to gain a worldwide release and achieve respectable sales. This was aided by the success of the Magnolia soundtrack, for the film of the same name by Paul Thomas Anderson, with which the album shares material. The first release was a limited-run 7-song preview EP which was sold at concerts and via her website. The full album was slated for a release through Interscope, but they did not think the material had commercial appeal. Mann purchased back the rights for \"six figures\", and began selling the album online. It was one of the first albums to be successful with only online sales, eventually selling 25,000 copies from Mann's website. After attracting attention, a distribution deal to traditional retail channels led to sales topping 200,000. The Japanese version of the album contains bonus material, the European version has a different track listing and slightly different material. The album was remastered and released in 2004 by the audiophile record label Mobile Fidelity Sound Lab (MFSL) as a hybrid stereo SACD and as an LP on 180-gram virgin vinyl."@en ;

The album was released on the group's own label, Mass Line Media, and Rawkus Records on June 12, 2007 nationwide and has available for purchase at their shows since May 11. The album's title is a Tagalog and Persian word meaning \"heroes of the people\" and \"the Word\" respectively. Those specific languages were chosen because the Blue Scholars' two members, Geologic and Sabzi, are Filipino and Persian respectively. The album is thematically similar to the duo's previous works, with some songs focused on socio-political issues and others showing devotion for the Seattle area. The song \"50K Deep\" in particular brings both themes together and describes the events of the [1999 Seattle WTO protests|\"Battle of Seattle\"]] in November 1999. The song was the inspiration for an interview featured in Seattle paper The Stranger with Geologic and Against Me! front-woman Laura Jane Grace, who also wrote a song about the WTO protests titled \"Baby, I'm an Anarchist.\" A video for the song \"Back Home\" was produced by Sabzi's brother Zia and released in June 2007. The duo also released a video for \"Joe Metro\" in November 2007. It features Geo riding Metro's route 48 around Seattle and walking the city streets. A video blog was posted to YouTube documenting the filming of the video. Since the original 25,000 copies released through Massline/Rawkus in 2007 are out of print, Blue Scholars re-released this album through Duck Down Records on September 1, 2009.

Compared to Seven Churches, Beyond the Gates has a more technical feeling and, due to poor production, a muddy sound. Reception was mixed, with some very disappointed by the album for the sound and production, while others were happy with the new direction of the band. Beyond the Gates became a sign of Possessed's decline, as they only released the EP The Eyes of Horror before they officially disbanded. The vinyl release of the album featured an enhanced gatefold-style format: the \"gates\" of the front cover opened outward, exposing several flaps that opened further to reveal a large illustration of a line of demonic creatures approaching over a desert landscape. Lyrics were included on the inner sleeve. In a recent Guitar World magazine, Possessed lead singer Jeff Becerra said Beyond the Gates was meant to be more of a commercial record, as their previous album had been banned from all major record stores, because of the upside down cross on the cover.[citation needed]"@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"By Your Side is the fifth studio album by American rock band The Black Crowes. It was released in early 1999 on Columbia Records, following the band's move from American Recordings, after second guitarist Marc Ford and bassist Johnny Colt had left the band in 1997. Audley Freed and Sven Pipien were hired as the new guitarist and bassist, respectively, although Rich Robinson played all the guitar parts on the album. By Your Side was recorded in New York City during the second quarter of 1998 and produced by Kevin Shirley. It comprised songs written in the studio, revised songs from pre-production and re-recorded songs from the abandoned 1997 album Band. The Black Crowes promoted By Your Side by performing on numerous television programs in North America and Europe. The album debuted at its peak position of number 26 on the Billboard 200 and generally received positive reviews. While some critics depreciated By Your Side for its similarity to albums by Rod Stewart and The Rolling Stones, most reviewers lauded The Black Crowes' return to the straightforward approach of their debut album, Shake Your Money Maker (1990). Chris Robinson's singing and Rich's guitar playing also won praise from critics, though reviews of the lyrics were mixed. Beginning in February 1999, the band toured North American theaters for two months in support of the album. Setlists from the tour, known as the \"Souled Out Tour\", typically included more than half the album's songs. The concerts were followed by a short co-headlining tour of US amphitheaters with Lenny Kravitz. The band spent the remainder of the summer opening for Aerosmith's European tour."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Californication is the seventh studio album by American rock band Red Hot Chili Peppers. It was released on June 7, 1999, on Warner Bros. Records and was produced by Rick Rubin. Californication marked the return of John Frusciante, who had previously appeared on Mother's Milk and Blood Sugar Sex Magik, to replace Dave Navarro as the band's guitarist. Frusciante's return was credited with changing the band's sound altogether, producing a notable shift in style from the music recorded with Navarro. The album's subject material incorporated various sexual innuendos commonly associated with the band, but also contained more varied themes than previous outings, including lust, death, contemplations of suicide, California, drugs, globalization, and travel. Californication is the Chili Peppers' most commercially successful studio release internationally, with over 15 million copies sold worldwide, and more than 5 million in the United States alone. As of 2002, the album had sold over 4 million copies in Europe. The record produced several hits for the band, including \"Otherside\", \"Californication\" and the Grammy Award-winning \"Scar Tissue\". Californication peaked at number three on the U.S. Billboard 200. The record marked a significant change in style for the band: Rolling Stone's Greg Tate noted that \"while all previous Chili Peppers projects have been highly spirited, Californication dares to be spiritual and epiphanic\"."@en ;

Opting to re-establish her music career, she began planning the project in 2011, shortly after her appearance in the movie Burlesque and the conclusion of her residency show at Caesars Palace. Work continued into 2012 and 2013. While the album was initially planned to be pop rock-oriented, Closer to the Truth ultimately became a prominently dance-inspired record. As executive producer, she enlisted longtime collaborator Mark Taylor to work alongside new producers such as Paul Oakenfold, Billy Mann, Timbaland and MachoPsycho to achieve Cher's desired sound. Described by Cher as \"very eclectic\" and \"her best album ever\", Closer to the Truth is not that much of a musical departure from her previous material, resulting in a primarily dance-pop record, yet it includes a broader range of various musical genres such as house, synthpop, EDM, soft rock and country and contains influences by the music of the 1990s. The lyrical themes revolve largely around romance, feminism, individualism and self-empowerment. The album also features additional vocals and songwriting duties from several new partners, including singers Pink and Jake Shears. The album received generally positive reviews from contemporary music critics, and was a success commercially, debuting and peaking at number three on the U.S. Billboard 200 with first-week sales of 63,000 copies, becoming Cher's highest-peaking solo album in the United States. As of February 2014, it sold 285,000 copies in the country according to Nielsen SoundScan and was certified gold by Music Canada. It charted within the top ten in Canada, Germany, Russia and the United Kingdom as well as moderately throughout several other international territories. The album has exceeded sales of 585,000 copies worldwide. \"Woman's World\" was released as the lead single from Closer to the Truth on June 18, 2013, in the United States and Canada, and peaked at number one on the US Billboard Hot Dance/Club Songs. The second single, \"I Hope You Find It\", was released on October 4, 2013, and charted strongly in several European national record charts. It was followed by promotional singles \"Take It Like a Man\" and \"I Walk Alone\". Cher promoted Closer to the Truth with several television appearances and performances worldwide. She garnered widespread media attention when she declined the invitation to perform at the 2014 Winter Olympics because of Russia's anti-LGBT sentiments. Later, Cher embarked on her eighth concert tour titled the Dressed to Kill Tour on March 22, 2014."@en ;

The album was recorded in London and produced by Martin Rushent who had previously worked with the Buzzcocks. The album inner cover, outwardly reminiscent of the era's British punk/new-wave designs, was original for the fact that the band's clothes were in fact printed on tracing paper, beneath which the band photo in fact showed the musicians naked (albeit with their legs tactically crossed). The design was created by fashion photographer/director Jean-Baptiste Mondino, later the artistic force behind the band's striking 1984 video for Un autre monde.

dbr:Cream_of_the_Crop	rdf:type	schema:MusicAlbum ;
	dbo:abstract	"Cream of the Crop is the eighteenth studio album released by Diana Ross & the Supremes for the Motown label. It was the final regular Supremes studio album to feature lead singer Diana Ross. The album was released in November 1969, after the release and rising success of the hit single \"Someday We'll Be Together.\" According to Motown data this album sold over 575,000 copies in the USA. \"Someday\" was originally to have been released as Ross' first solo single (Ross is backed on the recording by session singers Maxine and Julia Waters, not the Supremes). Motown chief Berry Gordy appended the Supremes billing to the single so as to create more publicity for Ross' exit from the group. Another selection of note is \"The Young Folks\" the charting b-side of \"No Matter What Sign You Are\" from Let the Sunshine In, later covered by The Jackson 5. Cream of the Crop also includes covers of songs by The Beatles (\"Hey Jude\") and Bob Dylan (\"Blowin' in the Wind\", also covered by Stevie Wonder). Since another Ross-led Supremes single or album had not been planned, Cream of the Crop was made up mostly of vaulted material. However, many songs such as those mentioned and \"Shadows of Society\" portend to a much more serious image for the group. \"Love Child\", the album was originally slated to be even more of a concept album where songs like \"Shadows of Society\", \"The Young Folks\" and the Top 10 hit, \"I'm Livin' in Shame\" were examples of a new image turn for the group had Ross remained in the group. The lead #1 single, \"Someday We'll Be Together\" proved to be a multi-format smash winning back their black fan base while not alienating their pop audience. The previous singles had much more of a pop sound. Along with their increasingly polished pop image, the group found themselves at odds with the new black pride sweeping across America. So it was a befitting finale for \"Someday We'll Be Together\" to reunite both of their audiences after The Supremes had originally been credited with leading the pop crossover for black acts in the 60s. As the final #1 single of the exciting but turbulent 60s, \"Someday We'll Be Together\" would prove quite prophetic in many ways. Peddle forward to 1993, the Frankie Knuckles mix of \"Someday We'll Be Together\" would become the lead single from Diana's retrospective box set, \"Forever Diana: Musical Memoirs\". The album closer, \"The Beginning of the End\", features Motown artist Syreeta Wright alongside Ross and Supremes members Mary Wilson and Cindy Birdsong. Wright was Berry Gordy's original choice to replace Ross in the Supremes, because she had a range and tone similar to Ross. However, Gordy and Supremes manager Shelly Berger decided instead to replace Ross with Jean Terrell, after seeing Terrell perform with her brother Ernie as part of their band, Ernie Terrell & the Heavyweights. Its modest Billboard album chart ranking at #33, though the album went Gold, was as much a reflection on the company's forthcoming focus on Diana Ross' solo debut as it was on the album's content of \"second tier\" songwriters. Motown had flooded the market with at least 4 new albums in a twelve-month period."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Damita Jo is the eighth studio album by American recording artist Janet Jackson. It was released on March 30, 2004, by Virgin Records. The album takes its title from Jackson's middle name. Its music incorporates rock, electro, house, and hip hop styles, in addition to dance-pop and R&B. Its concept is based on Jackson's alternate personalities; exploring themes involving intimacy, monogamy, love, and dance. Its production is derived from producers including Dallas Austin, Cathy Dennis, Scott Storch, BAG & Arnthor, Rich Harrison, T\u00E9l\u00E9popmusik, Just Blaze, and Kanye West; in addition to Jackson and Jam & Lewis. Recorded over eighteen months, it was the longest Jackson spent on a project. Jackson sought to find producers who identified with her emotions, intending \"hard-hitting dance music\". Producers declared it \"a really sexy record\" which was bold, fun, and positive. Multiple personae portrayed include the obstinate \"Damita Jo\" and lascivious \"Strawberry\". Jackson stated they were \"another way to express and expose a deeper part of me,\" comparing her writing process to that of a novelist; inventing characters with independent personalities. Jackson claimed the aforementioned characters \"absolutely\" live inside of her, stating it \"feels wonderful\" to release them. Prior to its completion, Jackson performed a medley of hits at the Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show. The performance ended in Jackson's breast being exposed by surprise guest Justin Timberlake. Conglomerates involved with the broadcast who received massive fines by the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC), including Viacom and CBS, and subsidiaries MTV and radio broadcasters Clear Channel Communications and Infinity Broadcasting, enforced a blacklist of Jackson's singles and music videos on many radio formats and music channels worldwide, although Timberlake was unaffected. An account labeled Jackson \"one of the most villified female artists of all time\", stating due to the blacklist, \"radio wouldn't play it and MTV wouldn't play her videos\" for singles which \"would've been out-of-the-park hits at any other point in Jackson's career\". The album received generally favorable reviews. Jackson replied to critics focusing on the album's suggestive content and Super Bowl incident in place of the music itself, stating she was \"fascinated\" by these interpretations, expressing concern for society's need to often place others within a specific sexual category. It garnered Jackson's second highest-first week sales in the US, and was certified platinum. Damita Jo sold over three million copies worldwide. It received a Grammy Award nomination for Best Contemporary R&B Album. Jackson was awarded several career accolades throughout its promotion. The album spawned three commercial singles: the rock-fused \"Just a Little While\", classic R&B ballad \"I Want You\", and electropop and funk influenced \"All Nite (Don't Stop)\". Due to blacklisting affecting its overall performance, the album has been considered underrated by music journalists in retrospect."@en ;

It also marked a new era for the band, as the production is more muddy and raw, and the guitar tone is more distorted than on the three previous albums. In addition, the album introduced a more complex and arguably progressive sound to several of its tracks."@en ;

The band uses studio drums instead of a drum machine for the first time since their third album, Bloody Kisses. Thus, it remains the only Type O Negative studio album with Johnny Kelly's actual playing, as he was only \"credited\" as the drummer on the three albums prior to Dead Again. The album booklet folds out into a cross shape. The cover photo is a portrayal of Grigori Rasputin, the Russian mystic and associate of Tsar Nicholas II. The lettering is in a faux-Cyrillic font. Reception for this album was quite positive among fans and critics and received the highest chart position for the band yet. The album was re-released in February 2008, with a DVD including live performances, interviews and music videos. A separate 3LP vinyl box set that included several collectors' items was also released."@en ;

The album was released to mixed-to-positive reviews, but was well received by the British public. It entered the UK album chart at #2, behind Gary Barlow's solo debut Open Road, and went on to gain platinum status after selling over 300,000 copies in the UK alone. The album featured three charting UK singles: \"Love Is the Law\" (#3), \"Blinded by the Sun\" (#7), and \"Love Me and Leave Me\" (#16), the latter of which was Liam Gallagher's first songwriting credit. NME readers voted The Seahorses the fourth best new act of 1997; Guitarist magazine readers voted Do It Yourself the tenth-best album of the year. A short UK tour in December 1997, with support from American alternative rock band Third Eye Blind, promoted the album's release, as did subsequent support slots with The Rolling Stones, U2 and Oasis. Ongoing recording sessions, which yielded the single \"You Can Talk to Me\" (UK #15, US Modern Rock Tracks #30), were aborted in January 1999, and the band split soon after, without completing the planned follow-up to Do It Yourself."@en ;

It reached number one in the UK Albums Chart with first week sales of just under 238,000, and is the 32nd fastest selling album ever in the UK. The album entered the US charts at number 12, with 65,000 copies sold in the first week, the highest any Oasis album had reached there since 1997's Be Here Now, although its chart stay was brief. Don't Believe the Truth went triple platinum in the UK in the first week of 2006 (900,000+ sales), and in the US has sold more than 200,000 copies. Every member of the band contributed to the writing of tracks for the album, and the album is the first where all duties were divided between the band members. On some of the tracks regular bass player Andy Bell handled guitar, while Gem Archer and Noel Gallagher contributed bass to other songs. Don't Believe the Truth is the first Oasis record to feature the drumming of Zak Starkey who, while not an official member of Oasis, performed and toured with them following the departure of longtime drummer Alan White. Liam Gallagher also had a larger impact on the album by his developing songwriting. Noel has said that this album is his favourite of Oasis' last four, because all members have contributed to it. This, he claims, has given it a different feel from a typically Noel-written Oasis album. The band embarked on a massive worldwide tour that started off at the London Astoria for their Don't Believe the Truth Tour, visiting 26 countries and playing to 3.2 million people at a total of 113 concerts. This resulted in the making of Lord Don't Slow Me Down, a film later released on DVD. To date the album has sold more than 7 million copies worldwide."@en ;

The album also includes Kara DioGuardi, Jason Reeves and Rooney frontman Robert Schwartzman, who collabrated from the album. Don't Forget features a power pop sound and the lyrics deal with various teen topics. The album was met with generally positive reviews from critics.

Elsewhere, Don't Forget reached the top ten on the Canadian Albums Chart and reached the top forty in Spain and New Zealand, as well as being certified Gold in Brazil. \"Get Back\" was released as the lead single from the album and reached number 43 on the Billboard Hot 100. \"La La Land\" was the second single from the album.

The album hit the Top Five on the Billboard album chart and remained on the chart for over two years (111 weeks). \"The Stroke\" was the first single, reaching number 17 on the Billboard Hot 100, and an even bigger hit at rock radio, hitting number 3 on the Mainstream Rock chart. The song even dented the British Pop charts, rising to number 52. The video for \"The Stroke\" \u2014 as most of the music videos from both Don't Say No and its follow-up, Emotions In Motion \u2014 is a straight-ahead performance piece, featuring Squier on an arena stage. Billy's many videos were staples on the then brand-new channel known as MTV which brought him increased popularity. \"In The Dark\" followed \"The Stroke\" into the Billboard Top 40, and the Top 10 of the Album Rock Tracks chart. \"Lonely Is The Night\" and many other tracks from the album were hugely popular on AOR (Album Oriented Rock) radio stations. The album was certified Gold by the RIAA for 500,000 sales in July 1981 and Platinum two months later. Though multi-platinum awards weren't certified prior to 1984, Don't Say No belatedly received a Triple Platinum award in 1992, certifying sales of over 3 million US copies.

Unlike some other celebrity duets efforts where performances were recorded separately and then combined by producers, such as Frank Sinatra's 1993 Duets, Bennett was physically present with each of his partners during recording. The vocals were performed live as the band was playing. It debuted at #3 on The Billboard 200 selling around 202,000 copies in its first week.

	dbo:abstract	"Duets is an album by American singer Frank Sinatra, released in 1993. Recorded near the end of Sinatra's career, it consists of electronically assembled duets between Sinatra and younger singers from various genres. The album was a commercial success, debuting at No. 2 on the Billboard albums chart, reaching No. 5 in the UK, and selling over 3 million copies in the US. It is the only Sinatra album to date to achieve triple platinum certification. The album received mixed critical notices, with complaints stemming from Sinatra's specified style of isolated performance wherein he was never joined by his duet partners in the studio, an artificial method of record production which lacked the elements of personal collaboration and spontaneity. The guest singers had been directed to sing along to his pre-recorded vocal parts, and to make their performances complement his. The cover art displays a specially commissioned painting of Frank Sinatra by LeRoy Neiman. Its sequel, Duets II, was released the following year. Both albums were packaged together in a \"90th Birthday Limited Collector's Edition\" released in 2005; North American pressings add an unreleased duet recording of \"My Way\" with Willie Nelson, while international pressings have him singing with Luciano Pavarotti."@en ;

It was released in conjunction with Bennett's 85th birthday and is a sequel to his previous duet album, Duets: An American Classic. One of the songs, \"Don't Get Around Much Anymore\", however, was released on iTunes as a free song on August 2, 2011. The album debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 chart, marking his first No. 1 album, selling 179,000 copies. He also became the oldest living artist to debut at No. 1 on Billboard 200. It was a milestone for Bennett in that it was not only his first No. 1 album but also his first album to debut at No. 1, both at the same time. Duets II recently achieved Platinum sales status in Canada as certified by Music Canada. The album won the Grammy Award for the Best Traditional Pop Vocal Album amongst 2011 releases at the 54th Annual Grammy Awards held in February 2012. Bennett also won another 2011 Grammy at the same ceremony for his duet with Amy Winehouse on the standard \"Body and Soul.\" The duo won the Grammy for Best Pop Duo or Group Performance. \"Body and Soul\" was one of Amy's favorite songs, and the track, recorded in March 2011, would become Winehouse's final recording before her death just a few months later, in July of that year. These two 2011 Grammy Awards were his 16th and 17th to date in his career, including a Lifetime Achievement Award, which was presented to him in 2001. \"Body and Soul\" was Bennett's first entry on the Billboard Hot 100 singles chart in nearly 45 years. In addition, Duets II earned arranger Jorge Calandrelli the Grammy for the Best Instrumental Arrangement Accompanying Vocalist(s) for Bennett's duet with Queen Latifah on the track \"Who Can I Turn To (When Nobody Needs Me)\" The Anthony Newley and Leslie Bricusse standard was featured in the 1964 London West End and Broadway musical The Roar of the Greasepaint, the Smell of the Crowd. Bennett recorded the song late that year and hit the Billboard Top 40 with the single. Bennett and duet partner Carrie Underwood performed \"It Had to Be You,\" the duet they sing on Duets II, during the same Grammy Awards ceremony and were also presenters at the ceremony. Tony Bennett: Portrait of an Artist, the photography of Kelsey Bennett and Josh Cheuse, was on display at The Morrison Hotel Gallery SoHo.

	dbo:abstract	"Erotica is the fifth studio album by American singer-songwriter Madonna. It was released on October 20, 1992, by Maverick Records. The album was released simultaneously with Madonna's first book publication, Sex; a coffee table book containing explicit photographs featuring the singer. It marked Madonna's first release under her own multi-media entertainment company, Maverick. Erotica is a concept album about sex and romance; she incorporated an alter ego named Mistress Dita, inspired by actress Dita Parlo. Some songs also take on a more confessional tone, influenced by the loss of Madonna's two close friends to AIDS. Madonna recorded the album in New York City with Shep Pettibone and Andr\u00E9 Betts while she was working on other projects. Pettibone sent her a tape with three songs when she was in Chicago and shortly after, they started the album's production in his apartment. During the sessions, they had problems during sequencing, and, as a result, Pettibone kept trying to move development as fast as possible as he did not want Madonna to lose interest in music. According to him, Madonna's compositions were serious, and intense, directing the creative direction of the songs into a deeply personal territory. The album's production was chronicled by Pettibone in an article called \"Erotica Diaries\", in Madonna's Icon magazine. Erotica received generally favorable reviews from music critics, who regarded it as one of Madonna's most adventurous albums and praised her comments on taboos and AIDS. Commercially, the album was less successful than Madonna's previous records. It peaked at number two on the Billboard 200, becoming her first studio album not to top the chart since her debut. Internationally, it topped the charts in Australia and France, while peaking inside the top five in many other countries, such as Canada, Germany, Japan, New Zealand and the United Kingdom. Erotica was certified double-platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) and has sold more than six million copies worldwide. Six singles were released from the album, with the title track and \"Deeper and Deeper\" becoming top-ten hits on the Billboard Hot 100. The album was supported by Madonna's fourth concert tour, The Girlie Show World Tour, which visited cities in North America, Latin America, Asia and Australia in 1993. Overlooked by the controversy surrounding her coffee table book Sex, Erotica has been considered as one of the most underrated albums of Madonna's career. The album was later listed as one of \"The 100 Best Albums of the 1990s\" by Slant Magazine."@en ;

This album is the first joint effort between the two musicians since 1981's My Life in the Bush of Ghosts and Eno's work producing and co-writing with Talking Heads. Byrne and Eno worked on the tracks in their home studios throughout 2007 and early 2008 and sent digital copies of the recordings to one another over e-mail. The single \"Strange Overtones\" was released for free to promote the album and Byrne toured through 2008 and 2009, performing songs from this release as well as the duo's previous collaborations. This tour was later documented with the live extended play Everything That Happens Will Happen on This Tour \u2013 David Byrne on Tour: Songs of David Byrne and Brian Eno and the concert film Ride, Rise, Roar. Everything That Happens Will Happen Today was released with a unique marketing strategy that involved Byrne creating the vanity label Todo Mundo and hiring Internet startup company Topspin Media to promote the album online using word-of-mouth and Internet sales to market the music. Several formats were created to allow users to have options on how to listen to the music\u2014from free streaming audio to a deluxe package housed in a tin."@en ;

To date, it is the John Butler Trio's most ambitious work[citation needed], containing many more instruments than previously seen on their albums, including a whole strings and horn section on some songs, with numerous percussion instruments for many more. Butler, having previously tried to self-produce the album, called upon Mario Caldato Jr. (Beastie Boys, Tone Loc) to assist. The album reached number one on the ARIA Albums Chart and the Billboard Heatseekers chart in the US, and as of 10 March 2008 it has reached triple Platinum Status (210,000+ copies sold). Grand National was the 7th highest selling album in Australia in 2007, remaining in the ARIA top 20 album charts for over nine months. The title of the album is derived from the antique dobro resophonic guitar that Butler inherited from his grandfather. In the 1920s the Dobro and National were competitors in the development of resonator or resophonic guitars, in 1934 they merged to form the National-Dobro Corporation, and hence the name of the album."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Halcyon Days is the reissue of English singer and songwriter Ellie Goulding's second studio album, Halcyon (2012). It was released on 23 August 2013 by Polydor Records. Following the release of Halcyon, Goulding announced that she had plans to repackage the original album, with new songs that focused on electronic music. For the reissue Goulding recorded ten new songs and worked with a variety of producers, including Ryan Tedder, Calvin Harris and Greg Kurstin, to create her desired sound. Goulding and the producers created a synthpop album that takes influence from indie pop, dream pop, alternative dance and features positive lyrics in contrast to her previous releases. Upon release, Halcyon Days was met with rave reviews from most music critics, who praised the album's musical expansion, its production and happier lyrical content. Commercially the reissue was a success and helped propel the original album on numerous charts. The lead single from the reissued album, \"Burn\", was released on 5 July 2013, becoming Goulding's first number-one single on the UK Singles Chart. The song also reached the top five in Germany and Ireland, and the top ten in Australia, France and New Zealand. \"How Long Will I Love You\" and \"Goodness Gracious\" were subsequently released as the second and third singles from Halcyon Days, respectively."@en ;

Individuals who we think basically went beyond their call of duty, put themselves into harms way for the good of others\". In an interview to the Brazilian Army's official blog, Sundstr\u00F6m explained that the idea for the track \"Smoking Snakes\" came when he was doing some research for the album: \"I tried searching for the word 'Helden', which means heroes in German. I then came across the story of the Drei Brasilianischen Helden (Three Brazilian Heroes) and, from that point on, we deepened our research and decided to write the track.\" On 17 April 2015, the Brazilian 14th Motorized Infantry Brigade Orchestra covered the song as a thanksgiving."@en ;

dbr:Hot_Space	rdf:type	schema:MusicAlbum ;
	dbo:abstract	"Hot Space is the tenth studio album by British rock band Queen, released in May 1982. Marking a notable shift in direction from their earlier work, they employed many elements of disco, funk, rhythm and blues, dance and pop music on the album. This made the album less popular with fans who preferred the traditional rock style they had come to associate with the band. Queen's decision to record a dance-oriented album germinated with the massive success in the US of their 1980 hit \"Another One Bites the Dust\" (and to a lesser extent, the UK success of the song too). \"Under Pressure\", Queen's collaboration with David Bowie, was released in 1981 and became the band's second #1 hit in the UK. Though included on Hot Space, the song was a separate project and recorded ahead of the album, before the controversy over Queen's new sound (disco-influenced rock music). The album's second single, \"Body Language\", peaked at #11 on the US charts. In July 2004, Q magazine listed Hot Space as one of the top fifteen albums where great rock acts lost the plot. Most of the album was recorded in Munich during the most turbulent period in the band's history, and Roger Taylor and Brian May lamented the new sound, with both being very critical of the influence Freddie Mercury's manager Paul Prenter had on the singer. Estimated sales of the album currently stand at 3.5 million copies."@en ;

The album was then officially released by Rimes on March 26, 2002, with four additional tracks and a new recording: \"Light the Fire Within\". In 2008, the album was released as a package with Rimes' debut album, Blue (1996). I Need You received mixed reviews by music critics, who praised its pop appeal but criticized the selection of the songs, noting that none of them made a significant impact on the listeners. In the United States, the album peaked at number one on the Billboard Top Country Albums chart, and reached number ten on the Billboard 200. Internationally, it peaked at number four on the Finnish Albums Chart, number ten on the Canadian Albums Chart, and number eleven on both the Austrian Albums Chart and the Irish Album Chart.

Sean Booth and Rob Brown have claimed that Incunabula, rather than a deliberate attempt at an album, is actually a compilation made by Warp right after they were signed.

The album\u2014the first independent release by Arjona after he was signed by Sony Music in 1993 and Warner Music in 2008\u2014was issued by his own label, Metamorfosis. Composed and written in a year, the record marks Arjona and Torres' fourth collaboration. For Independiente, Arjona returns to his trademark sound after his stylistic departure for Poquita Ropa (2010). While producing the latter, he had used fewer instruments to simplify his sound, having introduced what had been called a \"stripped-down acoustic effort\" in his music. Independiente has been compared to his earlier recordings, Historias (1994) and Animal Nocturno (1993). Independiente became Arjona's fourth number-one album on the Billboard Top Latin Albums where it debuted for the week ending 22 October 2011. For thirteen non-consecutive weeks it topped the Latin Pop Albums chart, and reached number one on the Mexican Albums Chart. It is his fifth consecutive album to chart on the Billboard 200 (reaching number sixty-five), and his fourth album to chart in Spain (peaking at number sixty-eight). Within one week after its release Independiente was certified gold in Chile, the United States and Mexico and certified platinum in Venezuela and Argentina. Five singles have been released from the album. The lead single, \"El Amor\", became a commercial success in several Latin American countries and was number one on the Billboard Latin Songs and Latin Pop Songs charts. It was followed by \"Fuiste T\u00FA\" (featuring Gaby Moreno), which reached number one on the Latin Pop Songs, number two on the Latin Songs charts and topped several other national charts. \"Mi Novia Se Me Est\u00E1 Poniendo Vieja\" was released in May 2012; \"Te Quiero\" in July 2012, and \"Si Tu No Existieras\" in November 2012.

None of the songs had appeared on any previous Ted Nugent album. Nugent explained at the time that about twenty previously unreleased songs were played at the beginning of the tour, and at the end the best ten were recorded live rather than in the studio later, because they were well-honed from months of performances and had the extra spark of a live setting.

	dbo:abstract	"JoJo is the debut studio album by American singer JoJo. It was released on June 22, 2004 by Da Family Entertainment, Blackground Records, and Universal Records. Incorporating pop and R&B, JoJo was influenced by Ella Fitzgerald, Bobby Brown, Aretha Franklin, and Beyonc\u00E9, amongst other of JoJo's idols. A special edition of the album featuring three bonus tracks, was released simultaneously alongside the 14-track standard edition, which was only be made available in some European and Oceanian countries. On the album, JoJo co-wrote three out of the 17 tracks. While recording the album, JoJo worked with many producers, such as Brian Alexander Morgan, Soulshock and Karlin, Vincent Herbert, Mike City, Balewa Muhammad, Tre Black, Bink!, Kwam\u00E9 \"K1 Mill\". and The Underdogs as well as others, to handle production for the album. JoJo recorded a number of songs for the album over an eight-month period. Amongst those included is a cover of R&B girl group SWV's 1993 hit single \"Weak\", in addition to one collaboration with Bow Wow, who features on the single release version of \"Baby It's You\". Occasionally, the album dips into other genres such as hip hop and soul music. The album was preceded by the release of JoJo's debut single, \"Leave (Get Out)\", which achieved critical and commercial success worldwide. In the United States, the single peaked inside the top 20 of the Billboard Hot 100 singles chart, and also topped the Pop 100 singles chart, making her the youngest artist in history to achieve this. In the United Kingdom, the single also performed well, reaching a peak of number two. Follow-up single \"Baby It's You\" featured rapper Bow Wow and became JoJo's second top 40 hit in the United States. In the United Kingdom, the song became her second Top 10 hit, peaking at number eight. The single also reached the top-10 of New Zealand, climbing to a peak of number ten. The third and final single, \"Not That Kinda Girl\" was released internationally only. However, it did see a minor release onto US radio. Due to the lack of a physical copy, the single failed to chart in the United States, becoming her first to do so. The single did manage to chart in Australia and Germany, however, the chart performance of the song was an overall failure. JoJo was promoted mainly through live, televised performances, appearing on shows such as On Air with Ryan Seacrest as well as performing at the 2004 Kid's Choice Awards. Aside from network appearances, JoJo also embarked on The Cingular Buddy Bash Tour with other artists, and as the opening act on the European leg of Usher's Truth Tour. The album debuted and peaked at number four on the US Billboard 200, selling 95,000 copies in its first week. It was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) on November 15, 2004, denoting US sales in excess of one million copies. The album also proved to be a success elsewhere. In the United Kingdom and Germany, the album has been certified gold, while in Canada, the album received a platinum certification. The album has sold over three million copies worldwide."@en ;

The album was recorded in celebration of their 30th anniversary and released on October 15, 1996 (although the television show premiered on September 12, 1966, Justus does coincide with the release of their first album, The Monkees, which was released on October 10, 1966). This album (released on CD) featured the return of Michael Nesmith. Justus was the first Monkees album since Head was released in 1968 to feature all four Monkees. Although Nesmith sang lead vocals only on a remake of the 1968 song \"Circle Sky\", he did write the Dolenz-vocal song, \"Admiral Mike\", and provided background vocals for all tracks. Although preliminary work on the album was begun using songs from various writers, upon Nesmith's agreement to join the production it was agreed that all songs would be written only by the four members of the group. The four also produced and recorded all the tracks jointly, making it the first Monkees album since Headquarters to be produced entirely by the group as a single unit, and the first album ever to be recorded by the foursome alone. A video was also produced to promote the album. \"Circle Sky\" is a remake from the Head soundtrack, with new lyrics from Nesmith. \"You and I\" is a different song as compared to the song of the same name on Instant Replay. It originally appeared on a 1976 album, Dolenz, Jones, Boyce & Hart, recorded during a reunion of Jones and Dolenz with Tommy Boyce and Bobby Hart, who were the band's first writers and producers. A different version of \"It's Not too Late\" appears on Jones's solo album Just for the Record, Vol. 4. The title is pronounced as either \"Justice\" or \"Just Us\", the latter implying that only the four Monkees perform on the album. The tracks \"Circle Sky\", \"You and I\" and \"Regional Girl\" were promoted, with music videos, in the 1997 television special \"Hey, Hey, It's The Monkees\". These songs, along with \"Oh, What A Night\" were performed as part of the 30th anniversary reunion tour. While all four members of the Monkees receive producer's credit, Michael Nesmith was the one that ultimately had the role of producing and mixing the project while the other three Monkees were on tour that year."@en ;

In 2000 Cope gave his blessings to re-release Kilimanjaro with a selection of bonus tracks (mainly single b-sides), original artwork, a remastered sound, and full lyrics and essays. A deluxe 3-disc edition followed in 2010, including original singles, b-sides and radio session recordings."@en ;

Featured guests include Ludacris, Estelle and Mims whilst some versions of the album will also have a bonus track which also features Bun B, Killa Kyleon, and Slim Thug. Described as \"showcasing a more laid back and comfortable LeToya\", Lady Love differs stylistically from its predecessor in that it incorporates less elements of hip-hop and hip-hop soul music, instead adopting a more polished, electronic sound, though it is still very much a R&B album. Lady Love debuted and peaked at number twelve on the US Billboard 200 Chart and number one on the US Billboard R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart."@en ;

Snippets of the Friday show were included on earlier DVDs, but the remastered release marked the first time that the concert has been presented in full. A Deluxe Edition also included the Saturday concert in remastered CD form. During the introduction to \"Who Wants to Live Forever\", Mercury addressed the rumours at the time of a Queen breakup by pointing to his posterior and saying, \"They're talking from here!\".

Meat Loaf's brother-in-law Tom Edmonds co-produced and mixed the album, which featured arrangements by Meat Loaf, Steve Buslowe, and Bob Kulick. The touring continued mainly as a ploy to keep Meat Loaf in the public eye and out of bankruptcy. On this album one hears \"Rock 'n' Roll Mercenaries\", being sung by both Meat and John Parr, although it is known that on what was the second day of performance at Wembley, Parr stormed off the stage after the song over him not being introduced for the second time by Meat as a guest performer. To try to get his career back off the ground, Meat Loaf started touring small venues, anywhere that would have him, such as pubs and clubs. Slowly, he developed a faithful following which grew to the point where they were unable to fit into the venues that Meat Loaf was playing and then they too began to grow. This carried on until the late 1980s where he began to sell out arenas and stadiums again. He even sold over 10,000 tickets at Ohio State. Leslie studied to be a travel agent so they could save on travel expenses and they toured all over the United States, Germany, England, Scandinavia, Ireland, Italy, Spain, Abu Dhabi, Oman and Bahrain. Due to the success of the touring, Meat Loaf and Jim Steinman got to work on Bat Out Of Hell II: Back Into Hell which was released in 1993, seven years after Blind Before I Stop. The album was a huge success and is considered one of the greatest comebacks in music history."@en ;

The DVD was included with the \"Bad 25\" reissue, as well as a stand-alone DVD. This is the third tour by Jackson to be released on a home format (the first two being the first leg performance of the DVD \"Live in Bucharest: The Dangerous Tour\" and the VHS \"HIStory World Tour: Live in Seoul\"). The recording is a performance of the Bad world tour, performing songs from the album \"Bad\". The music video for the song \"Another Part of Me\" features footage from other concerts in Wembley as well as Paris. This particular concert took place on July 16, 1988, at Wembley Stadium in Wembley, London, to a sold-out crowd of 72,000, which included Diana, Princess of Wales and Charles, Prince of Wales. Jackson originally removed \"Dirty Diana\" from this night's performance, worried that he would offend Princess Diana or the royal family. However, the princess informed Jackson it was her favorite song. In an interview, Jackson stated that he was unable to put the song into the set, which led some fans to believe \"Dirty Diana\" was not performed on July 16. However, leaked audio snippets prove that the song was re-added to the setlist. In addition to the full July 16 concert, the DVD also includes \"The Way You Make Me Feel\", from the previous night on July 15 (the song was not performed on July 16 due to a late start of the show) and \"I Just Can't Stop Loving You\", and \"Bad\", performed on September 26, 1987, in Yokohama, Japan.

It was recorded at the Gods Festival in Bradford, England on 2 June 2002, where Hardline was the headliner for this festival. The concert was an all day festival which featured eight other bands, such as Jeff Scott Soto, whom marked his first live performance as a solo artist, and Harem Scarem. Hardline was the last band to play at 2 a.m. and during the first couple of songs on the show, the band was suffering from technical and sound problems on stage. The microphones and equipment were worn out after being on all day. This also affected the back up singer's microphones the most, causing them to not hear their own voices over the loud music. While performing the ballad \"Face the Night\", an angry Johnny Gioeli storms off stage to talk to the Tech Staff to fix the microphones, but keeps his cool and comes back on stage to perform the rest of the show. Three back up singers were used (two female, one male) at the concert. The female backup singers, Gudi Laos and Katja Kutz also toured with Johnny's other band - Axel Rudi Pell - on their 2002 Shadow Zone tour. The line up for the band members in the show is the same as Hardline's second album, with the exception of bass player Christopher Maloney's replacement by producer Bob Burch. The CD version contains 3 bonus tracks, originally written for the album II. The DVD features the entire concert with no bonus footage, however there is a slide show containing photos taken from the concert at the end after the credits, while the unreleased track \"Hypnotized,\" which was originally written for what was going to be Hardline's second album with the original line-up, plays as background. Gioeli also revealed in a 2002 interview regarding II that he had attempted to get the original Hardline line-up back together for both the new album and the Gods Festival. \"Deen was contacted first and although he was interested in doing it he was petrified that Neal would be angry if he did it. I contacted Neal directly and he was all in favor of doing solos on the record based on him liking the songs. I said, 'Play on what you like and the fans will love it.' I had no way of knowing how to get in touch with Todd. I think he was back on the road with David Lee Roth. I just recently got word back from our keyboard player Michael that Todd would have been interested doing the record. It's a real kick in the ass but hey he couldn't have anyway being on the road. I almost had the whole band back. I tried for the Hardline fans.\""@en ;

As part of New West's series of albums featuring individual artists' performances on Austin City Limits, it was recorded on April 1, 1989, several months after the release of Full Circle, Jennings' last album for MCA Records, and a year before the singer's move to Epic Records would yield The Eagle. The songs themselves primarily include popular selections from Jennings' own catalog: \"I'm a Ramblin' Man\", \"America\", \"Good Ol' Boys\", \"Luckenbach, Texas (Back to the Basics of Love)\" and \"Mamas Don't Let Your Babies Grow Up to Be Cowboys\", among others.

Instead it was released in June 2007 by the band for free download on the internet with a higher quality CD available for purchase. In an interview with Nashville's The City Paper, Brother Henry's leader and cellist, David Henry discussed the marketing strategy behind the release. \"We're offering the CD as a free download for anyone who wants it on the Brother Henry Official Website\", Henry said. \"Our philosophy now is we want to create and expand our fan base, and we feel that anyone who's willing to download the CD will then want to hear those same songs in concert. It's our way of building our audience, without having to get involved in the huge money expenditures that you've have to do if you got involved with a big label.\" \"The big thing I think that's really happening now in Nashville is the feeling that it's really better to do it yourself or do it independently unless you really have a sweetheart deal\", Henry said. \"We'd think about it if a major label wanted to commit a half-million dollars in promotion and marketing to one of our projects. But otherwise, it doesn't make any sense to get involved with something where you may sell a few thousand copies and then have to divide any profits that you get. It used to be there were maybe three acts that were being groomed and courted at any one time by a label. Now there are at least 200 really talented groups that are handling their own musical business, working independently and building their own fan bases and audiences.\" About the CD, Henry said, \"It's more musically extensive and rigorous, especially some of the instrumental parts. We wanted to bring to this new disc some of the energy from some things we'd been doing for other projects.\" His twin brother who plays lead guitar, Ned Henry, commented to The Tennessean, \"All four members write songs the band uses, and whoever writes it, sings it. There's not one focal person. Most bands tend to have one central character, and I feel like we contribute a bit more on an even level.\""@en ;

dbr:Machiavelli_and_the_Four_Seasons	rdf:type	schema:MusicAlbum ;
	dbo:abstract	"Machiavelli and the Four Seasons is a 1995 album by the Australian rock group TISM (This Is Serious Mum). It is TISM's most famous release and the one with which they received the most critical success and fame. The album was certified Gold by the ARIA Awards and won the ARIA Award for Best Independent Release. The award was accepted in person by Les Murray, the subject of the song \"What Nationality is Les Murray?\"', who read a seemingly insulting acceptance speech in his native Hungarian. Three of its songs reached Triple J's Hottest 100, two of them in the top 10. This was also TISM's highest charting album, reaching number 8 in the Aria Charts. The album featured TISM's switch from Alternative rock to synth-driven techno and dance music, which still retained the loud guitars and vocal melodies of their earlier music. The two singles Greg! The Stop Sign!! and (He'll Never Be An) Ol' Man River are two of TISM's most well known tracks. The cover of the album is not TISM unmasked: it is a cover of The Hollywood Argyles. The title is a composite phrase of doo wop group Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons and thinker Niccol\u00F2 Machiavelli. The unusual title stems from a conceit found throughout the cover, although not in the tracks themselves, that this is actually an album by a group called \"Machiavelli and the Four Seasons\". The liner notes include an essay on the band's music, written with gushing praise. Track titles are also given, entirely revolving around the words \"I\", \"Love\", \"You\" and \"Baby\". A hidden track at the end of the actual album, entitled \"Phillip Glass's Arse\", is a melodic, a cappella harmonised song that gives a representation of what Machiavelli and the Four Seasons might actually sound like. TISM used the name \"Machiavelli and the Four Seasons\", among others, to book secret concerts in 1994. The actual tracks contain many fan favourites from TISM's catalogue and continue in the typical lyrical vein of parodying and insulting most elements of popular culture. Most well known are the singles \"Greg! The Stop Sign!!\" (featuring a famous Beach Boys style falsetto chorus) and the live favourite \"(He'll Never Be An) Ol' Man River,\" which deconstructs celebrity hero worship, encapsulated in the verse: References are also made to significant works of literature and politics, including Fyodor Dostoevsky's \"The Brothers Karamazov\" (\"All Homeboys Are Dickheads\"), Percy Bysshe Shelley's \"Ozymandias\" (\"Aussiemandias\") and Adolf Hitler's \"Mein Kampf\" (\"How Do I Love Thee?\"). \"Lose Your Delusion II\" is a play on the Guns N' Roses album Use Your Illusion II (\"Lose Your Delusion I\" appeared on Australia The Lucky Cunt), while \"Play Mistral for Me\" is a reference to 1971 film Play Misty for Me, Clint Eastwood's directorial debut. The album also contains the slightly controversial track \"!Uoy Sevol Natas\", an inversion of \"Satan Loves You!\". A parody of the belief that many classic rock songs contain backwards-masked Satanic messages."@en ;

It featured ballads such as the hit singles \"The Love I Saw in You Was Just a Mirage\" and \"More Love\", as well as the up-tempo \"The Tears of a Clown\" co-written by Stevie Wonder and his producer Hank Cosby. Three years after the album's release, \"The Tears of a Clown\" was issued as a single, and charted at #1 on both the Billboard Hot 100 and UK Singles Chart. As a result, Make It Happen was reissued as The Tears of a Clown in 1970. Stevie Wonder was a contributing writer on three of the album's songs, the aforementioned \"The Tears of a Clown\", \"After You Put Back the Pieces (I'll Still Have a Broken Heart)\", and \"My Love Is Your Love (Forever)\". Holland-Dozier-Holland contributed the delightful good-times dance song \"It's a Good Feeling\". Smokey's fellow Miracles Warren \"Pete\" Moore and Marv Tarplin collaborated with him on the songs \"You Must Be Love\" (a popular regional hit tune), and \"The Love I Saw in You Was Just a Mirage\" (a Top 20 Hit) respectively, and all of The Miracles (except Claudette) co-wrote the up-tempo rocker \"Dancing's Alright\". The album also features a rendition of their good friends, Little Anthony & The Imperials' 1964 Top 20 smash, \"I'm on the Outside (Looking In)\" \"The Tears of a Clown\" on the monaural version of the album has an alternate lead vocal. Critics at Allmusic praised the album, giving it 4-1/2 out of five stars, calling it \"The most underrated Miracles LP of the '60s\", and stating that, in addition to the album's three hits, it also had \"featured a spate of [other] great songs, including three or four that really should've been hits\"."@en ;

The album contains fourteen tracks (seventeen in some territories), including the first single \"Two Times Blue\", released on the iTunes Store on June 6, 2007. Harry promoted the album on Cyndi Lauper's True Colors Tour 2007, performing a number of songs from the album. Upon its release in the UK, it debuted at #86. In the US, it debuted at #37 on the Independent Chart. In several interviews, Harry said the album was recorded slowly. At first, the project was just a handful of songs from over a few years that she had never intended to develop into a full album. Debbie had also stated that a song from the recording, \"If I Had You\", is what inspired the whole creation of the album. Then, before she knew it, she was working with Barb Morrison and Charles Nieland of production team Super Buddha and found herself on the Eleven Seven Music label. The initial release date was set for the end of summer, but it was continuously pushed back until its release in autumn. On January 18, 2008, an official music video for \"If I Had You\" was released and on Harry's official blog, she stated the song was the planned second single."@en ;

It was released on January 20, 2015, under FNC Entertainment and distributed by CJ E&M. As CNBLUE's promotions for their mini-album Can't Stop (2014) came to a close, the label announced plans for Jung to release a solo album within the year. Since the album's inception, he sought to distance himself from the band's sound and include various musical styles on the record. Ultimately, he conceived a collaborative album with an array of musicians. By late 2014, the album was scheduled to be released in early 2015. Teasers revealing the musicians Jung collaborated with were released one-by-one the following January, which included rapper Verbal Jint, rock musician Yoon Do-hyun, and Singaporean singer JJ Lin. \"Mileage\" with actor and rapper Yang Dong-geun (YDG) was first released on January 9. After a series of photo and video teasers thereafter, the album and lead single \"One Fine Day\" were released. Jung began promoting the album through music chart programs across various television networks by performing \"One Fine Day\" and the collaboration tracks. The single ultimately led him to win a total of four music show trophies, including two consecutive wins on Korean Broadcasting System's (KBS) Music Bank. One Fine Day received generally favorable reviews from music critics, who noted his growth as a singer-songwriter, but also cited familiarity with CNBLUE's music. The album went on to top the Gaon Album Chart for two non-consecutive weeks. In March, a Japanese edition titled Aru Suteki na Hi: Japan Special Edition (\u3042\u308B\u7D20\u6575\u306A\u65E5 \uFF5EJapan Special Edition\uFF5E) was released, which peaked at number four on the weekly Oricon Albums Chart. Jung embarked on his first series of solo concerts across Asia; select shows were recorded, spawning live and video releases.

	dbo:abstract	"One of the Boys is the second studio album by American singer Katy Perry. It was released on June 17, 2008 by Capitol Records. During the making of the album, Perry was dropped from two record labels and went through two canceled albums. She collaborated with producers Greg Wells, Dr. Luke, David A. Stewart, and Max Martin among others on the album. All songs were written by the singer, with assistance of some other producers and writers. It was composed in a pop-rock style. A EP, Ur So Gay, which contains the album's promotional single, \"Ur So Gay\", was released to generate interest on the singer and the then-upcoming album. One of the Boys received mixed reception from critics. Some deemed it as being filled with \"potential hits\", while others criticized Perry's vocal performance. The album debuted at number nine on the US Billboard 200, with 47,000 copies sold in its first week. It was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), and also reached the top ten in countries such as Austria, Canada, Germany, Mexico, and Switzerland. One of the Boys earned Perry two Grammy Award nominations, and has sold 7 million copies worldwide. The first single released from the album, \"I Kissed a Girl\", became her first Billboard Hot 100 number-one single; the second single \"Hot n Cold\" reached number three in the US while topping charts in Germany, Canada, the Netherlands, and Austria. The album's third single, \"Thinking of You\", reached the top-thirty in the US, while the final single \"Waking Up in Vegas\" became a top-ten hit. To further promote the album, Perry embarked on three tours: Warped Tour 2008, her first solo world tour \"Hello Katy Tour\", as well as being the opening act in No Doubt's 2009 Summer Tour."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"One of the Boys is the third studio solo album by the Who's lead vocalist, Roger Daltrey. It was first released in 1977, on Polydor in the UK, and MCA in the US. The sessions were recorded at the Who's Ramport Studios during the winter of 1976 (vocals were recorded at Pathe Marconi Studios in Paris, due to tax complications), and Daltrey allowed students from the local Battersea technical school to film them as an educational project. This also marked the first time that Daltrey had written or co-written a song since \"Here For More\" (released as the B-side of the Who's \"The Seeker\") in 1970, and Lisztomania in 1975. Daltrey's original choice for producers were Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller, but they declined. When Leo Sayer launched his own career as an artist, Daltrey called on a widening group of friends to write for and perform on his albums. Paul McCartney of the Beatles contributed the new song \"Giddy\" to One of the Boys, where the band included Hank B. Marvin of the Shadows, Eric Clapton of Cream, Alvin Lee and Mick Ronson, as well as calling two members of the Who, John Entwistle and Keith Moon. He would embrace punk rock on this album, He appeared in press photos with a safety pin through his nose and a chain attached to his ear."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Only Human is the fourth studio album by English recording artist Cheryl. It was released on 7 November 2014, through Polydor Records. Following a slew of media invasion, Cheryl took a one-year hiatus from music. Following her hiatus, Cheryl confirmed that Girls Aloud would reunite and release a greatest hits compilation. After its release, the group embarked on their last tour and announced their permanent split. In July 2013 Cheryl began recording Only Human; the recording was later completed in August 2014. Only Human explores themes of being at peace with oneself, banishing bad influences and living life to the full. Musically, the album follows in the same vein as Cheryl's previous work, taking influence from pop and R&B, however the album contains a diverse musical style ranging from the 1980s, disco-pop to electro. The album's production is characterized as being sparsely-produced. Cheryl worked with a variety of writers and producers including frequent collaborators and new ones to create her desired sound, she also contributed a large amount of writing herself. The album was preceded by lead single \"Crazy Stupid Love\", which featured British rapper Tinie Tempah, released on 18 July 2014. The song debuted at number one on the UK Singles Chart, selling 118,000 copies in its first week, becoming Cole's fourth number one single. The album's second single, \"I Don't Care\", was released before the album on 31 October 2014 and became Cheryl's fifth number one making chart history as she is the first ever British female solo artist to have five number ones in the UK. Only Human entered the UK Albums Chart at number seven."@en ;
