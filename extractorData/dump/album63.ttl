	dbo:abstract	"Little Voice is the second studio album and debut major-label album by American singer-songwriter Sara Bareilles, which was released on July 17, 2007 on the Epic Records label. Six of the tracks are re-recorded studio versions of songs from her previous album, Careful Confessions. A two-disc special edition of Little Voice with live acoustic tracks was released on March 18, 2008. The bonus disc also includes an interview with Bareilles and accompanying videos of the performances. The album debuted on the US Billboard 200 at number 45, selling about 16,000 copies in its first week. As of January 13, 2011, the album has been certified platinum by the RIAA and peaked at number seven on the Billboard 200 and has currently sold over one million copies in the United States. The album debuted at number 26 in New Zealand, helped by \"Love Song\" reaching number one on the radio airplay chart. In the United Kingdom, the album debuted at #9 with sales of 14,484. \"Love Song\" was selected as the first single. It was featured as the iTunes Single of the Week from June 19 to 26, 2007. In 2008, \"Bottle It Up\" was released as the second single. The video was directed by Marcos Siega. The third single in the United States was supposed to be \"Gravity\", with the video released on February 3, 2009, but no further information was ever revealed as to the date of the single release. The album was well received by critics. \"Love Song\" was nominated for Song of the Year and Best Female Pop Vocal Performance at the 51st Grammy Awards. When asked in an interview by British newspaper The Daily Mirror about how she would describe her music, Bareilles said, \"I guess I would say it's piano-based pop/soul,\" and said she listened to a lot of early soul and jazz when making the album."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Live at Royal Opera House and also known as Vespertine Live at Royal Opera House is an official DVD released by Bj\u00F6rk on 18 November 2002. It contains a live performance by Bj\u00F6rk on the Vespertine World Tour, recorded live at the Royal Opera House in London, England, on 7 December 2001. It was amongst one of the last of the concerts performed on that tour. With this concert Bj\u00F6rk had become the first ever contemporary pop artist to perform in the Royal Opera House. The concert was exclusively premiered on UK television in the launch week of the BBC digital channel BBC Four on 12 March 2002. For the first half of the concert the majority of the songs were taken from her then most recent album Vespertine, while the second half sees songs played from her previous solo albums. The closing song \"It's in Our Hands\" (which was then previously unheard) was later released as the lead-off single from her Greatest Hits album. The track \"Generous Palmstroke\" is a B-side, and appears in a different form on the \"Hidden Place\" single. Although listed as \"Frosti\", the first song of the concert is actually a music box version of \"Pagan Poetry\", as it appears on the \"Cocoon\" single. The DVD (and television broadcast) omits performances of two songs that were performed on the night - \"Play Dead\" and \"Bachelorette\". A mini-documentary \"Touring Vespertine\" is also included as a bonus feature, a working version of what was to become the Minuscule DVD. However, the Minuscule documentary does not include some material which is included on \"Touring Vespertine\", such as the short interviews with composer Simon Lee (who was part of the Vespertine tour)."@en ;

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Live_at_the_House_of_Blues_(The_Vandals_album)>	rdf:type	schema:MusicAlbum ;
	dbo:abstract	"Live at the House of Blues is a live album and video by the southern California punk rock band The Vandals, released in 2004 by Kung Fu Records and Kung Fu Films. It was the band's second official live album and video, the first being 1991's Sweatin' to the Oldies. It was released in 2 packages, one a DVD with a bonus concert CD, the other a CD with a bonus DVD. Both packages contain the same discs and material, merely packaged differently so that it could be stacked on both CD and DVD shelves. It was presented as episode 9 of Kung Fu Films' The Show Must Go Off! live concert DVD series (episode 1 had also been a live Vandals concert, from their 2001 Christmas Formal). Kung Fu Films is an offshoot of Kung Fu Records, the record label started in 1996 by Vandals members Joe Escalante and Warren Fitzgerald. Having previously worked in the television and film industries, Joe Escalante acts as director and producer for nearly all of these live DVD releases. The performance relies heavily on material from the band's albums since 1990, when the current lineup solidified, and excludes songs from their first three releases of the 1980s. As the current lineup of the Vandals grew in popularity and recognition throughout the 1990s they began to distance themselves from the material performed by earlier incarnations of the band, of which only Escalante remains. These earlier songs tended to attract an older, more violent audience which the current lineup of the band eschewed in favor of newer, younger fans attracted to their more recent output. These early songs had already been released in live format on Sweatin' to the Oldies 13 years earlier, so the band also felt that it would be redundant to rehash that part of their past. The DVD contains numerous bonus features including band member commentaries (Escalante, Fiztgerald and singer Dave Quackenbush), a photo gallery, hidden bonus footage, English subtitles, links to additional online content, and a \"Josh Freese Cam\" option that allows the viewer to switch the camera angle at any time during the concert to one focusing directly on drummer Josh Freese, with a picture-in-picture display of his foot pedal."@en ;

Low Level Owl: Volume I saw the band craft a seamless, flowing suite of post-rock influenced songs hinging on simple, repeated arpeggiated guitar riffs, swathes of keyboards and found sounds, with Chris Crisci's vocals buried in the mix. Fusing the songs together were ambient passages and atmospheric instrumentals. The album was greeted mostly with very enthusiastic reviews, although some were put off by the intentionally repetitive nature of some of the tracks and by the connective ambient passages.

In a press release, singer Angus Andrew said the recording process had been \"almost the exact opposite\" of creating their last album WIXIW and that \"instead of being doubtful, work on the new album has been immediate, fun, instinctual and confident\". The record was largely recorded at the band's own No Gold Studios in Los Angeles. The first single from the album, Mess On A Mission, was released on 17 March, backed with remixes from Silent Servant, SFV Acid, Black Bananas (Jennifer Herrema) and Nest Of Teens. Regarding the single, a Mute press release quotes the band: \"Mess On A Mission acknowledges some of the modern day issues of uncertainty, of being overwhelmed with possibilities, too many choices and it vocalises them. It's cathartic and a more positive spin on something our music has always dealt with: anxiety.\""@en ;

It is her first full-length release after a three-year hiatus since H-Logic (2010).

She also worked with blues musician Kim Tae-chun, and her then-boyfriend Lee Sang-soon for the new record. Beenzino, a member of hip-hop duo Jazzyfact, Bak Ji-yong from vocal trio Honey G, comedian Ahn Young-mi, and Lee's companion dog Soonshim participated on the album as featured artists. Monochrome contains a total of sixteen tracks, including the lead single \"Bad Girls\", the self-composed hit \"Miss Korea\", and \"Show Show Show\", a cover of \"No No No\" originally performed by German pop trio Monrose. A special edition of the album, featuring a 156-page photo book and limited to 5,000 copies, was available for pre-order starting on May 9, 2013.

This was also the group's first album in 15 years without longtime members Rick Wills (who joined the band in 1979) and Dennis Elliott (who was a founding member). To date, this is Foreigner's final studio release with Gramm, and it was the band's final studio release in the 20th century. A track entitled \"Crash and Burn\" was also featured as a bonus track on the Japanese release."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"My Love: Essential Collection is a greatest hits album by Canadian recording artist Celine Dion. It was released by Columbia Records on October 24, 2008 as the follow up to her previous English-language compilation, All the Way... A Decade of Song (1999). Before releasing My Love: Essential Collection, Dion had already sold over 200 million albums worldwide. In the album's liner notes, she dedicated this collection of songs, recorded between 1990 and 2008, to her fans who supported her throughout the years. My Love: Essential Collection was released as a single disc, consisting of Dion's most successful singles, including: \"My Heart Will Go On\", \"Because You Loved Me\" and \"The Power of Love\". The two-disc edition, entitled My Love: Ultimate Essential Collection has been further expanded to include rare songs that have not previously appeared on her albums. Both editions include one new track, \"There Comes a Time\". The album wasn't released in Japan because Sony Music Entertainment decided to issue different compilation there, Complete Best. My Love: Essential Collection received a positive response. It topped the albums charts in the Netherlands, Belgium and Ireland, as well as the compilation album chart in France. My Love: Essential Collection debuted at number two in Canada, number five in the United Kingdom and number eight in the United States, and was certified double-Platinum in Canada and Ireland, Platinum in Belgium and Gold in Mexico, Finland, New Zealand and Hungary. The first single from the album, \"My Love\", was a semi-autobiographic song written for Dion by Linda Perry, originally available on Taking Chances (2007). In France, \"I'm Alive\" (Remix) was released as a promotional single instead. In July 2011, My Love: Ultimate Essential Collection was re-issued with the same track listings as part of Sony's The Essential line."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"My World is the debut extended play (EP) by Canadian recording artist Justin Bieber. It was released on 17 November 2009, by Island Records. The album is considered the first half of a two-piece project, later being supplemented by his debut studio album My World 2.0 (2010). After signing a recording contract in light of his growing popularity on YouTube, Bieber worked with collaborators including his mentor Usher, in addition to producers Tricky Stewart, The-Dream, and Midi Mafia. Its music incorporates pop and R&B styles, and lyrically discusses teen romance and coming of age situations. Upon its release, My World received generally favorable reviews from music critics, who complimented its production. It debuted at number six on the US Billboard 200 with first-week sales of 137,000 copies. In doing so, it became the strongest-debuting release for a new artist in 2009, though it was topped the following week by I Dreamed a Dream by Susan Boyle, which moved 701,000 units. Upon the release of My World 2.0 in March 2010, its predecessor peaked at number five. Less than two months after its release, the record was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for sales exceeding one million copies. Internationally, the extended play attained similar success. It debuted atop the Canadian Albums Chart, where it was later certified double platinum. It additionally attained double platinum recognition in the United Kingdom. Two singles were released from My World, both of which became international successes. Its lead single \"One Time\" reached the top twenty in five countries' singles charts, while its follow-up \"One Less Lonely Girl\" peaked within the top ten in Canada and top fifteen in the United States. The promotional singles \"Love Me\" and \"Favorite Girl\" peaked in the top forty of the US Billboard Hot 100. The project was additionally promoted through television appearances and the My World Tour in 2010. The remix album My Worlds Acoustic and compilation album My Worlds: The Collection were released later that November; the latter packaged My World, My World 2.0, and My Worlds Acoustic into a two-disc set. On February 12th, 2016, the EP was released on vinyl for the first time."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Octavarium is the eighth studio album by American progressive metal/rock band Dream Theater. Released on June 7, 2005, it was the band's final release with Atlantic Records. Recorded between September 2004 and February 2005, the album holds the distinction of being the last album ever recorded at The Hit Factory in New York City. With Octavarium, the band decided to create \"a classic Dream Theater album\", drawing upon their various stylistic influences while trying to make the music less complex. The album takes as its creative concept the musical octave. Octavarium peaked in the top five in the Finnish, Italian, and Swedish charts, and in the top ten in the Dutch, Japanese, and Norwegian charts. Critical reception of the album was generally positive; the diversity of the music was praised, although critics found some of the songwriting to be inconsistent. Dream Theater promoted the album on a year-long world tour, with the majority of concerts lasting almost three hours and featuring a different setlist each night. The tour finished at Radio City Music Hall accompanied by an orchestra; this performance was recorded and released as a live album and concert video entitled Score. They co-headlined the 2005 North American Gigantour with Megadeth."@en ;

The CD is edited, with some songs omitted, though the DVD version of the concert is complete. The album was reissued in 1999, and included a bonus CD with the missing songs. The CD and DVD cover features the band replicating their iconic Saturday Night Fever pose. The concert was re-released on SD Blu-ray by Eagle Rock Entertainment in 2013. The re-release provides superior audio quality than that possible on DVD, but video is only marginally improved (the standard-definition video is now up-scaled to 1080i). The Bee Gees performed songs from every decade from the 1960s to the '90s. They also sang a tribute song to their late brother Andy Gibb, \"(Our Love) Don't Throw It All Away\". During this song old footage of Andy is shown, including him singing the second verse of the song. The vocals from the original recording also play during that section. C\u00E9line Dion guest-starred on the Bee Gees-penned \"Immortality\". Recorded vocals by Frankie Valli are featured during \"Grease\", and are also taken from the original song. The album's title was originally meant to reflect the band's plan that the Las Vegas concert would be their final live performance ever. Barry Gibb's arthritis had worsened to the point where it seemed it would be impossible for him to continue playing, but he wanted to expand the tour and so they played several more shows."@en ;

The song that gave the title to the album was \"Orange Blossom Special\", released previous to the album, it became a success. At the time it was recorded, the authorship of the song was not widely known, being commonly covered by diverse artists. Cash learned from Maybelle Carter that the song was written by Ervin T. Rouse, who Cash later met during a show in Miami, Florida. Cash's recording is unusual in his repertoire for featuring a tenor saxophone solo by Boots Randolph, an instrument (and musician) rarely spotlighted on Cash's recordings. The album also contains three covers of Bob Dylan songs, that he gave Cash after a concert in Newport, Rhode Island. \"It Ain't Me Babe\", \"Don't Think Twice, it's Alright\" and \"Mama, You've Been on My Mind\". The last one was only recorded by Dylan as a demo, but it was first released in an album by Cash. Cash had previously borrowed the melody of \"Don't Think Twice\" for his recording \"Understand Your Man.\" Released on February 1965, the album reached number three in Billboard's Country albums as well as forty-nine in pop albums respectively. The single \"Orange Blossom Special\" peaked number three on Billboards Hot Country Singles and the duet with June Carter \"It Ain't Me Babe\" peaked number four in Hot Country Singles."@en ;

In the UK, the album reached No. 8 and stayed for 9 weeks on the chart. The album was reissued by Concord Records on June 7, 2011 to mark its 50th Anniversary. According to several reviewers[who?], compared to the original CD issues, or the previously issued LP's, this CD is a noteworthy improvement in sound. Some of the original top-heavy reverberation on Sinatra's voice has been decreased for a more natural effect. But what has plagued this album since its first CD issue is that the channels are reversed from any of the original LP and tape issues.[citation needed] From its first issue on CD, the brass is on the left and saxes on the right. But on open reel tape and the original LP issues, the brass is on the right with saxes on the left."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Roller Coaster is the second album, released in 2004, by Scott Cain, singer-songwriter and winner of Australian Popstars 2002. It was released on the ABC Kids label and is targeted at children, but is lyrically relatively adult and not dissimilar to his debut album, Controlled Folly. However Cain co-wrote every song on Roller Coaster compared to only two on his debut. The album's themes, according to the press release, are \"songs that most kids can relate to; from having your first celebrity crush, hanging out, and generally enjoying life\". Many of the tracks on Roller Coaster relate somehow to skateboarding. The track \"Hilary Duff\" (about Hilary Duff, sometimes called \"I've Got a Crush on Hilary Duff\") was released for airplay as a promotional single, and a music video was shot, but the track never quite saw release as a proper commercial single. The track \"Perfect Day\" here made its second appearance, having also been included on Controlled Folly in 2002, and \"Step Into My World\" was originally released on a Roadshow compilation in 2003. Despite massive commercial failure, this album sparked a minor career revival for Cain, who received limited airplay with \"Hilary Duff\" and soon after the album's release opened for Hilary Duff on her tour of Australia. The track \"Don't Stop Rollin'\" also became well known for coining the popular expression \"Chafeboard! Watch out!\". However, Roller Coaster is now out of print and was entirely removed from the ABC website less than a year after release. In 2005, Roller Coaster was picked up by an independent distributor in Japan, where it became surprisingly popular on the children's market. The Japanese release added five bonus tracks, including rarities and previously unreleased material."@en ;

The album was largely considered to be an unadventurous retread of what he had done before, including covers of Chuck Berry, Sam Cooke and Bob Dylan songs, as well as a duet with Elton John of John's song \"Let Me Be Your Car\". Stewart's one attempt at adventurousness was a cover of Carole King's \"(You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman\" where 'Woman' is switched to 'Man'. This track was selected for special derision by critics. The release of the album itself was held up for five months due to legal problems between Mercury Records and Warner Bros. Records. This album sold 1 million copies worldwide.[citation needed] Musicians appearing on the album included members of Stewart's band Faces, as well as frequent collaborators Martin Quittenton (guitars), Pete Sears (bass & keyboards), and Mickey Waller (drums), who had become something of a second band for Stewart."@en ;

The EPs had been given as gifts to friends and family of Stevens over the past six years, except for 2004 where he was too busy recording the Illinois album. Though the first three EPs have been available on Sufjan Stevens-related fansites for several years, Songs for Christmas is the first official release of these EPs. Most of the tracks are versions of traditional Christmas songs, with a number of original compositions such as \"Sister Winter\" and \"Star of Wonder\". Sufjan Stevens has developed a reputation for being a devoted Christian and many of the songs he chose for inclusion on Songs for Christmas are religious in nature, including his original compositions. The box set includes a poster of Sufjan Stevens, an animated short for \"Put the Lights on the Tree\" by Tom Eaton, an essay by Rick Moody, two original short stories by Stevens, stickers, comics and a sing-a-long book for all five discs. During Stevens' international tour in the later half of 2006, he regularly performed the original song \"That Was the Worst Christmas Ever\" while releasing inflatable Santas into the audience for fun. Songs for Christmas was generally well received by music critics. Stevens released a follow up, Silver and Gold: Songs for Christmas, Vols. 6-10, in November 2012, which contains a further 58 original and traditional songs."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Starting Over is the fourth album by the 1970s power pop band Raspberries. It peaked at #143 on the Billboard pop album chart in 1974. The LP generated the #18 Billboard pop single \"Overnight Sensation (Hit Record)\"; a second single, \"Cruisin' Music,\" had been issued as a single but was uncharted. Stylistically, Starting Over represented a more aggressive arena rock/hard rock sound compared to previous albums in a way reminiscent of The Who, which was one of the groups' biggest influences. The album also included softer ballads such as \"Rose Coloured Glasses\" and \"Cry\". This album was re-released on CD as part of Power Pop Volume 2, which also contains their album Side 3. Starting Over featured a new line-up, with Scott McCarl (Bass, Vocals), and Michael McBride (Drums), who had drummed with Carmen and Bryson in their previous band in the late 60's, Cyrus Erie. Jim Bonfanti and Dave Smalley left the band the previous year. Bruce Springsteen's drummer Max Weinberg has said that he based his early drum style (particularly on the Springsteen album Darkness On The Edge of Town) on Raspberries drummer Michael McBride's work in this album, while Springsteen himself has also mentioned several times in live performances that the title track is one of the greatest pop songs ever written. John Lennon, a Raspberries fan, particularly liked the song \"Overnight Sensation.\" He was present for part of the recording of the Starting Over LP and, although not credited on the LP, is said to have assisted with the mix, including \"Overnight Sensation.\" Critic Mark Deming of the All Music Guide praised the album as \"a fine farewell from one of the best American pop bands of their era, though they didn't know it would be their last album when they were making it.\""@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Starting Over is the twenty-second album released by American country singer Reba McEntire in 1995. It was a tribute to her roots and influences, featuring cover versions of songs by artists whom she admired growing up. Among the artists being covered were Dolly Parton, Donna Summer, Linda Ronstadt, The Supremes, Lee Greenwood and Patti LaBelle. McEntire called on Trisha Yearwood, Martina McBride and Linda Davis to join her for \"On My Own\", the album's first single. Additionally, a CBS television special entitled Reba: Celebrating 20 Years featured McEntire performing songs from the album in concert interspersed with footage of her returning home to her family in Oklahoma. The special was eventually released separately on video. The album peaked at No. 1 on the Billboard country albums chart and at No. 5 on the Billboard 200. It was certified Platinum by the RIAA three months after its release. The album featured only one Top 10 single, \"Ring On Her Finger, Time On Her Hands\", which had been previously a Top Ten country hit for Greenwood in the mid-1980s; McEntire's rendition was a Top Ten hit as well upon its 1996 release, reaching No. 9 on the Billboard Hot Country Singles chart. The third single, \"Starting Over Again\" was composed by Summer and her husband Bruce Sudano, and had originally been a number one hit for Parton in 1980; McEntire's version reached the top-twenty. The fourth and final single, a cover of the Supremes' hit \"You Keep Me Hangin' On\", was not released to country radio, but did reach number 2 on Billboard's Hot Dance Club Play chart. Love to Infinity produced remixes of the track \"You Keep Me Hangin' On\" that were released to dance clubs in the US. As a result, this song spent two weeks at No. 2 on the Billboard Hot Dance Club Play chart, McEntire's only hit on this survey. It debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard Country Albums chart for the week of October 21, 1995 selling 101,000 copies. It stayed at No. 1 for two consecutive weeks. It stayed in the Top Ten for 19 weeks.

According to RIAA certification, Stay Hungry gained multi-platinum status with U.S. sales of more than 3,000,000 copies. Twisted Sister performed the song \"Burn in Hell\" during a cameo appearance in the 1985 film Pee-wee's Big Adventure. The song \"Burn in Hell\" was covered by black metal band Dimmu Borgir on Puritanical Euphoric Misanthropia. \"We're Not Gonna Take It\" was also covered by Bif Naked on the Ready to Rumble soundtrack. The two songs that comprise the Horror-Teria segment became the basis of Twisted Sister lead singer Dee Snider's 1998 film Strangeland, in which Captain Howdy was played by Snider himself. The \"Captain Howdy\" segment of the \"Horror-Teria\" suite would later be covered by the death metal group Broken Hope on their album Repulsive Conception and in 1999 by the Swedish heavy metal band Morgana Lefay on their Symphony of the Damned, Re-symphonised album. In 2004, the band re-recorded the tracks from this album and re-released them under the title Still Hungry.

The two artists collaborated again (with the credits in the reverse order) on their 1992 album Soma. There is a strong sense of surrealism throughout the album.

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Stronger_(Kelly_Clarkson_album)>	rdf:type	schema:MusicAlbum ;
	dbo:abstract	"Stronger is the fifth studio album by American singer Kelly Clarkson. The album was released on October 21, 2011, in Australia and October 24, 2011, in the United States and the United Kingdom by RCA Records. The thirteen-song track-list (seventeen on the deluxe edition) features Clarkson collaborating with new producers Greg Kurstin, Steve Jordan, Rodney Jerkins, Toby Gad, Brian Kennedy and Ester Dean, as well as recording with Howard Benson whom she collaborated with on her previous album, All I Ever Wanted (2009). Wanting to stray away sonically from her previous albums, Clarkson's main objective was to record her vocal performances as it is heard in her live sets, and used as little auto-tune processing as possible. The album also marked the first release by Clarkson that did not cause a conflict with RCA; her previous records, most notably My December, were released amidst conflict and controversy. Clarkson began writing new material for the album in November 2009 while touring and finished recording in February 2011. For the recording sessions, Clarkson drew inspiration from Tina Turner, Prince, Radiohead, and Sheryl Crow among others. Clarkson also mixed R&B, country, urban, dance-pop and soul with her established pop rock character to develop a more diverse pop music material. The album's lyrical content mainly explores themes about heartbreak, vengeance, forgiveness and empowerment using metaphors about Clarkson's relationships around people. The record is predominantly a pop rock album, with several music critics noting the predominant R&B and country influences Clarkson explored in Thankful and All I Ever Wanted as well as dance-pop themes which Clarkson has newly developed. Originally planned to be released in late 2010, the release date of the album was pushed back several times. Upon its release, Stronger received mostly favorable reviews from critics, who noted the album's lack of progression unlike her previous albums but notably praising Clarkson's vocal performance. The album became a commercial success. In the United States, the album debuted at number two on the Billboard 200 and sustained commercial longevity for over a year, eventually becoming her first record to be certified platinum in five years by the Recording Industry Association of America since My December. Internationally, it debuted within the top-ten in Australia, Canada, Ireland, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom. Stronger has produced three singles, including the international hits \"Mr. Know It All\" and \"Stronger (What Doesn't Kill You)\". \"Mr. Know It All\" topped the charts in Australia and South Korea and has attained top-ten positions in four countries, including Billboard Hot 100 in the United States. \"Stronger (What Doesn't Kill You)\" became the album's most successful release and Clarkson's most successful single overall. It topped the charts in the United States, Poland, Denmark, and Slovakia and has attained top-ten positions in over twenty countries around the world. The final single, \"Dark Side\", was released to moderate success, attaining a top-ten position in three countries. Clarkson has promoted Stronger in two concert tours, the Stronger Tour and the 2012 Summer Tour with American alternative rock band, The Fray. Stronger received four nominations at the 55th Grammy Awards: It won the Best Pop Vocal Album and was nominated for Record of the Year, Song of the Year, and Best Pop Solo Performance for \"Stronger (What Doesn't Kill You)\"."@en ;

Both the album's title and cover artwork are an ironic, self-aware nod to the removedness from the band's surf rock roots. Its name was taken from the song of the same title written by Brian Wilson and Van Dyke Parks five years earlier for the abandoned studio album Smile. Surf's Up's creative direction was largely influenced by newly employed band manager Jack Rieley, who strove to reinvent the group's image and reintroduce them into music's counter-culture. Two singles were issued in the US: \"Long Promised Road\" and \"Surf's Up\". Only the former charted, peaking at number 89. In 2004, the album was voted 154 in a German edition of Rolling Stone's \"The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time\" and ranked 61 on Pitchfork Media's \"The Top 100 Albums Of The 1970s\".

The album also featured the modest hit \"What Good Am I Without You?\". Shortly after this album was released, Weston left Motown in a dispute over royalties (coincidentally, Mary Wells had departed from Motown two years prior after also recording a duets album - Together - with Gaye). Weston's replacement as Gaye's duet partner was Tammi Terrell, who recorded several successful hit singles with Gaye during the late 1960s."@en ;

It is Stevens' sixth studio album and his first song-based full-length album in five years, since the release of Illinois in 2005. The album features a heavy use of electronics augmented by orchestration, and takes inspiration from the apocalyptic artwork of schizophrenic artist Royal Robertson. Stevens' use of electronics marked a radical departure from much of his previous work\u2014most notably from Seven Swans and Michigan. Unlike Illinois, the lyrics do not explore events, characters or setting, but deal instead with themes and emotions on a personal level. Critics praised the intimacy of the album, but many were divided over the change in style that Stevens had taken. Nonetheless, it appeared on several \"best of 2010\" lists\u2014including those of Paste, The New York Times and MTV. Commercially, the album gave Stevens his career's best first week sales to date and was his highest charting album to date, peaking in the top ten on the Billboard 200."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"The Future is the second studio album from American R&B group Guy, released in 1990 on Uptown Records and MCA Records. The album had a much darker tone in stark contrast to their debut. Most of it had to do with things going on behind the scenes. A year after the release of their debut album, they fired their manager Gene Griffin- who they claimed allocated funds from the group. This revelation angered all of the members, and particularly infuriated lead singer Aaron Hall- so much so that he didn't sing on half of the album. Hall revealed: As a result, Riley assumed the duties of lead vocals for the remainder of The Future. Also on a tour with their MCA labelmates New Edition, things got out of hand between the two acts. Although New Edition were headliners, Guy happened to upstage them a few dates into the tour. This created a rivalry backstage that turned deadly. One of New Edition's production managers Ronald Boyd shot and killed Anthony Bee- a member of Guy's security detail. Guy would dedicate the song \"Long Gone\" to the memory of Bee- as well as Wrecks-N-Effect member Brandon Mitchell, who was also killed in the same year. The Future contained songs where they attacked their former manager Gene Griffin and his then-proteges, Motown Records recording group Basic Black. By the time they released the fifth single \"Let's Stay Together\" in early 1992, Guy called it quits and embarked on separate endeavors, with Aaron and Damion releasing solo albums and Teddy starting the group Blackstreet. A couple of the songs from The Future have been covered. Priority Records singer Toni Estes covered the song \"Let's Chill\" from her 2000 debut Two Eleven. Singer Charlie Wilson also covered \"Let's Chill\" from his 2005 album Charlie, Last Name Wilson. R&B singer Case covered the song \"Smile\" on his 2009 album The Rose Experience."@en ;

dbr:The_Glorious_Burden	rdf:type	schema:MusicAlbum ;
	dbo:abstract	"The Glorious Burden is a studio album by the American heavy metal band Iced Earth. It is a concept album, which explores various moments in military history, such as the signing of the Declaration of Independence, the American Revolutionary War, and Waterloo. It also pays tribute to world events such as World War I, the World Trade Center attacks and the ravages of Attila the Hun. See the tracklist for links to the historical context of the songs. The album includes a trilogy entitled Gettysburg (1863). Each of the three songs represents one day in the Battle of Gettysburg, the largest battle ever conducted in the Western Hemisphere and considered the turning point in the American Civil War. This album features the debut of lead singer Tim 'Ripper' Owens, formerly of Judas Priest. Owens, who at that time was still in Judas Priest, was asked to do the vocals as a side project. However, he joined the band full-time after Judas Priest reunited with Rob Halford. The album was first recorded with Matt Barlow on vocals, but band leader Jon Schaffer was not satisfied with his performance. Due to the events of September 11th, Barlow became more interested in law enforcement than the music business, and according to Schaffer \"Matt's heart was not in it and it showed in his performance.\" As a result, Matt left the band and the album was shelved until a new vocalist could be found. However, some of Barlow's initial recordings remain on the record as backing vocals, and he is credited with co-writing two songs. This record is the only Iced Earth album to feature Ralph Santolla on lead guitars. This was the last studio album for bassist James MacDonough and drummer Richard Christy. The album was released in three different formats: a limited edition 2-CD version in digipak format, an American version and a European version. See the tracklist for the differences. \"The Reckoning (Don't Tread on Me)\", \"Declaration Day\", and the acoustic version of \"When the Eagle Cries (Unplugged)\" were all released as music videos."@en ;

As with the rest of the series, The Moment of Truth features mostly unsigned bands contributing songs that were previously unreleased. Reviewer Kurt Morris of Allmusic remarks that \"this third installment of the Emo Diaries saga is strong from start to finish\" and that \"Penfold's track should be required listening for all people proclaiming to have a knowledge of what the term emo means.\" While criticizing some of the songs towards the middle of the compilation as \"a bit weak\", he notes that \"Chase Theory, Epstein, and Last Days of April all contribute dynamic and passionate tracks to help close the album out persuasively. A very convincing and solid release, this very well might be the peak of these celebrated compilations.\""@en ;

The second half, The Parallax II: Future Sequence is a full-length album that was released on October 9, 2012. Between the Buried and Me made the conscious decision to precede a studio album with an extended play for several reasons, particularly to release a first album on Metal Blade fairly quickly. In addition to being part of a concept album series, frontman Tommy Giles Rogers also listed wanting to keep the group's name \"out there\" and seeking new material to perform at concerts in an interview with MetalSucks. In support of the release, Between the Buried and Me toured North America with Job for a Cowboy, The Ocean and Cephalic Carnage during April through May 2011. During this tour, the group performed the entire EP, along with several tracks from previous albums, live at all concert dates."@en ;

The album was produced by George Harrison and released on the Beatles' Apple record label. It compiled two hit singles by the Temple devotees, \"Hare Krishna Mantra\" and \"Govinda\", with other Sanskrit-worded mantras and prayers recorded with Harrison from July 1969 onwards. The recordings reflected Harrison's commitment to the Gaudiya Vaishnava teachings of the movement's leader, A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada, who had sent devotees from San Francisco to London in 1968. The success of the Temple's first single, \"Hare Krishna Mantra\", helped popularise the Hare Krishna movement in the West, and inspired Harrison's more overtly religious songs on his 1970 triple album All Things Must Pass. Among the Temple members, former jazz musician and future ISKCON leader Mukunda Goswami provided the musical arrangements on the recordings. After its initial release, the album was reissued on the Spiritual Sky label and by Prabhupada's Bhaktivedanta Book Trust, often with the new title Goddess of Fortune. Apple officially reissued The Radha Krsna Temple on CD in 1993, and again in 2010, with the addition of two bonus tracks."@en ;

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/The_Specials_(album)>	rdf:type	schema:MusicAlbum ;
	dbo:abstract	"The Specials is the debut album by British ska revival band the Specials. Released on 19 October 1979 on Jerry Dammers' 2 Tone label, the album is seen by some as the defining moment in the UK ska scene. Produced by Elvis Costello, the album captures the disaffection and anger felt by the youth of the UK's \"concrete jungle\"\u2014a phrase borrowed from Bob Marley's 1972 album Catch a Fire but equally apposite used here to describe the grim, violent inner cities of 1970s Britain. Musically, the album encapsulates the wave of British ska, greatly reworking the original sound of 1960s Jamaican ska. The music shares the infectious energy and humour of the original sound, but injects new-found anger and punk sensibility. The resulting sound is considerably less laid-back and \"Caribbean\" sounding than original ska, and dispensed with much of the percussion and the larger horn sections used in the older variety. The Specials also brought guitar to the front of the mix; it had often been a secondary instrument in Jamaican ska. The album features a mixture of original material and several covers of classic Jamaican ska tracks, a debt which went uncredited on the 1979 release. Many songs on the Specials' debut album were covers of older Jamaican songs. \"Monkey Man\" had been a hit for Toots & the Maytals in 1969, \"Too Hot\" was a Prince Buster original from 1966, and the opening track, \"A Message to You, Rudy\" was a Dandy Livingstone single in 1967. \"You're Wondering Now\" was originally performed by duo Andy & Joey and later covered by The Skatalites; the vocal version was recorded by Andy & Joey in 1964. Other tracks are reworkings of Jamaican originals: \"Too Much Too Young\" was based on Lloyd Charmers' \"Birth Control\" and \"Stupid Marriage\" draws heavily on the Prince Buster hit \"Judge 400 Years\" (also known as \"Judge Dread\"). A live version of \"Too Much Too Young\" was later released on a five-track EP, The Special AKA Live!, which went to number one on the UK charts. \"'A Message to You, Rudy\" was also released as a single. Trombonist Rico Rodriguez, who performed on many '50s and '60s Jamaican recordings before moving to London in 1962, played on the band's version of \"A Message to You, Rudy\", as he had on the original recording 15 years previously. As a former member of the legendary Skatalites, a band that helped define the sound of ska, Rico's appearance on the album considerably added to the album's credentials. A digitally remastered edition also featuring promotional videos to \"Gangsters\" and \"Too Much Too Young\" as enhanced content was released by EMI in 2002. Also, the song \"Little Bitch\" is featured as a playable song on the very first release of the dance simulation game Dance Dance Revolution."@en ;

With The Visitors, ABBA took several steps away from the \"lighter\" pop music they had recorded previously and the album is often regarded as a more complex and mature effort. The opening track, \"The Visitors\", with its ominous synthesizer sounds and the distinctive lead vocal by Frida, announced a change in musical style. With Benny and Frida going their separate ways, the pain of splitting up was explored yet again in \"When All Is Said and Done\". The major hit single on the album, \"One of Us\" also depicted the end of a love story. Elsewhere there were current Cold War themes\u2014highly topical at the time\u2014and further songs of isolation and regret. The Visitors album was one of the first records ever to be recorded and mixed digitally, and was the first in history to be released on the new CD format in 1982 on Atlantic. The Visitors has been reissued in digitally remastered form three times\u2014first in 1996, then in 2001 and again in 2005 as part of The Complete Studio Recordings box set. The Visitors Deluxe Edition was released on 23 April 2012.

He did not release any new material until 15 Minutes, 10 years later. The album was not commercially successful, failing to make any national impact in the European charts. The two singles from the album also failed to gather much attention, with \"One Step Ahead\" only peaking at #55 in the UK, and \"Elisabeth's Eyes\" failing to chart altogether. Although the album was produced by Peter Wolf and co-produced by Brian Malouf, both singles were written shortly after Kershaw was unhappy with Wolf's production and his direction for the album. Both singles were produced by Kershaw and Julian Mendelsohn, whilst the two also re-worked the production of the entire album, earning them an additional production credit. After the original release, the album remained out-of-print on any format for years.

It is My Chemical Romance's first release through Reprise. Their first and previous album, I Brought You My Bullets, You Brought Me Your Love, was released through Eyeball Records. It is the band's final release to feature drummer Matt Pelissier, who would later be replaced by Bob Bryar. The album was certified platinum in less than a year from its release. The album has sold over one million copies in the United States. In Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge, My Chemical Romance produced a cleaner sound than that of what they produced in I Brought You My Bullets, You Brought Me Your Love. The album was a success for both the band and the label, although it did meet with mixed reception. The album lifted the popularity for My Chemical Romance more than I Brought You My Bullets, You Brought Me Your Love had. Gerard Way has described the album as a \"pseudo-conceptual horror story\". The four released singles from the record included \"I'm Not Okay (I Promise)\", \"Helena\", \"The Ghost of You\", and in the United Kingdom, \"Thank You for the Venom\". The non-single tracks on the album have been praised as some of the album's \"bests\" as well, such as \"Hang 'Em High\" and \"The Jetset Life is Gonna Kill You\".

	dbo:abstract	"To Our Children's Children's Children is the fifth album by The Moody Blues, first issued in late 1969. It was the first album released on the group's newly formed Threshold Records label, which was named after the band's previous album from the same year, On the Threshold of a Dream. It was inspired by the 1969 moon landing, and the songs centre on the twin themes of space travel and children, with minor-key tonalities and a distinct psychedelic influence. It is the fourth of what are popularly considered the group's \"core seven\" (or Classic Seven) albums from 1967 to 1972, and as such represents the peak of their career to some. While the extracted single, \"Watching and Waiting\", did not do well in that market, To Our Children's Children's Children was critically well received and sold well, reaching #2 in the UK and #14 in the US. The band found most of the songs impossible to perform live, due to extremely lush orchestrations and a great deal of overdubbing. For this reason their following album, A Question of Balance, was more stripped down and basic in instrumentation. This change only lasted for one album and the next, Every Good Boy Deserves Favour, saw a return to their earlier orchestral sound. The album was mixed and released in both stereo and quadraphonic. In March 2006, the album was remastered into SACD format and repackaged as a 2CD Deluxe Edition. In 2008, a remaster for single standard audio CD was issued with the five bonus tracks. The song \"Out and In\" originally was credited to both Mike Pinder and John Lodge, their only collaboration noted as such; but on the 1997 CD rerelease, Lodge's co-writing credit was omitted."@en ;

It is a song which I wrote when I was seventeen. I think many people will be able to relate to the message in it.\" The single was released to radio on 23 October, and saw a full release in November. The single peaked at number twenty-six in Australia, breaking his record run of consecutive Top 10 hits. In February 2008, the track \"Everybody Needs a Little Help\" was released to radio. Like most of Noll's singles, the track hit number one on the Australian Airplay Chart. Following the great success of the single on radio, a physical/digital release was planned, yet was ultimately scrapped as Sony BMG created breathing space for the onset of Noll's first compilation album, No Turning Back: The Story So Far."@en ;

It was the last album to feature guitarist David Cummings, who left to begin a successful career in TV scriptwriting, and the only to feature drummer Chris Sharrock, who agreed to play on Twisted but declined to join the band as a permanent member. With a firmer emphasis on electric guitars than the band's last outing, 1992's Change Everything, the album represented a moderate change of direction for Del Amitri, whilst retaining their trademark melodic sensibilities. The album included Del Amitri's most successful single, \"Roll to Me\", which reached the top ten in the US Hot 100. The band are known not to consider the song one of their best, however, and have often seemed irked by the fact that what they see as a throwaway pop song gave them their biggest hit.

	dbo:abstract	"Unchained, also known as American II: Unchained, is the second album in Johnny Cash's American Recording series (and his 82nd overall). Like all Cash's albums for American, Unchained was produced by Rick Rubin. In contrast to the first American Recordings album, on which Cash played alone, on the follow-up he is backed by Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers, with guest appearances by Flea, bassist from Red Hot Chili Peppers, on \"Spiritual\", and Lindsey Buckingham and Mick Fleetwood, both of Fleetwood Mac, on \"Sea of Heartbreak\". Unchained focuses more on covers and less on original material than the first album in the series. In addition to three of Cash's own compositions, Unchained contained songs by Tom Petty (\"Southern Accents\"), Soundgarden (\"Rusty Cage\") and Beck (\"Rowboat\"), The album also included a cover of the classic 1962 Hank Snow song, \"I've Been Everywhere\", written by Geoff Mack, and remakes of two songs Cash recorded early in his career for Sun Records: \"Country Boy\" and \"Mean Eyed Cat\". In comparison with the country folk sound of Cash's other American Recordings' albums this one has more of a hard, true country rock sound. The album was recorded over a six-month period with engineer Sylvia Massy at Sound City Studios, Ocean Way Studios, Rick Rubin's home studio and The Cowboy Arms And Recording Spa in Nashville, Tennessee. Unchained received a Grammy for Best Country Album and Cash was nominated for Best Male Country Vocal Performance for his version of Rusty Cage."@en ;

The album spawned the band's first Top 20 hit in the UK for over five years with the track \"Walking on the Milky Way\". However, follow-up single \"Universal\" and the album itself performed poorly and this lack of success prompted singer Andy McCluskey to disband the group.

	dbo:abstract	"Vein is the thirteenth album by Japanese experimental band Boris. The album was released on vinyl on October 2006 through Important Records and was limited to 1500 copies only. Vein became somewhat controversial for the long delays prior to the release but most importantly for presenting two different albums under the album's title. As the label in charge of the release explained, \"Every aspect of this beautiful release was planned and designed by Boris and they have stated that it has very special meaning for them\". In 2013, the band announced that the album would be released as a 2-CD set but that this was not a reissue of the album, but rather a re-arrangement of both albums combined. The label in charge of this release explained that this release sounds different from the previous versions. The album was packaged in two 3\" CDs with the same printed outer edge as the vinyl release to make them appear to be traditional 5\" CDs. Part of track A7 of the hardcore vinyl version is used in the untitled final track of Smile. It is present unadulterated, but as an alternate, bass-heavy mix, on the Southern Lord US vinyl pressing of Smile as \"VEIN;\" it is thus removed from the untitled song. The 2013 CD pressing of Vein moves this to track 11 and is yet another mix, this one even incorporating the backwards guitar melody from the untitled Smile track. This creates a circle of sampling that intermingles the two albums."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Warehouse: Songs and Stories (1987) is the sixth and final studio album by alternative rock band H\u00FCsker D\u00FC, originally released by Warner Bros. Records as a double album on two vinyl LPs. The band dissolved following the tour in support of its release, in part due to disagreements between song-writers Bob Mould and Grant Hart over the latter's drug use. This album, along with Candy Apple Grey, showcases the increasing maturity of Mould and Hart's writing\u2014a change which alienated some long-time fans. This album is also known for its battle between the two songwriters, with Mould famously telling Hart that he would never have more than half of the songs on a H\u00FCsker D\u00FC album.[citation needed] Mould later said that this time period was a \"rough stretch\", but that Warehouse was still a \"good record.\" \"Had it been pared back to a single record it might have had more impact, but we were already loggerheads at that point.\" The album's title comes from the fact that the group had rented some warehouse space in which to write and rehearse; a change from their former practice of writing new material and testing it out on live audiences. During the recording sessions, Hart and Mould replaced a few of Greg Norton's bass tracks for their respective songs when Norton's own contributions were not to their liking. In his autobiography, Mould identified Hart's \"Charity, Chastity, Prudence and Hope\" as one of the songs whose bass lines were rerecorded, uncredited, by their composers. \"Could You Be the One?\", was released as a single and video. Other singles released from the album were \"She's a Woman (And Now He Is a Man)\" and \"Ice Cold Ice\". Warehouse: Songs and Stories peaked at #117 on the Billboard Top 200 and also charted for a week on the UK Albums Chart at #72. H\u00FCsker D\u00FC also performed 'Could You Be the One?' and 'She's a Woman (And Now He is a Man)' live on the Late Show with Joan Rivers on April 27, 1987. The band were also interviewed by Joan.

The album is the band's first release through Rise Records since leaving Trustkill Records. Weight of the World was recorded in February 2010. The songs \"Worship Syndrome\" and \"The Search\" were previously released on This Is Hell's 2009 EP, Warbirds. One of the themes of Weight of the World is living life to its fullest potential and avoiding pressures to become \"ideal.\" The opening track \"No One Leaves Unscathed,\" is about following one's true passion, and not taking a 9 to 5 job just because \"society tells us we need to.\" Professional wrestler Terry Funk partially influenced Rick Jiminez's lyrics on the song. Jiminez praised Funk's ability to wrestle into his 60s, commenting, \"He found his passion in life and inexplicably immersed himself in it from a very young age and stuck with it well into middle age. He paved his own way in his industry, constantly pushed the limit and surprisingly, never let it go to his head.\""@en ;

The record was refined and mastered at Sterling Sound, New York City. It was released on April 27, 1983 in the United States, with Warner Bros. Records as the primary label. Sales for Whammy! were generally weaker than their previous album, but overall successful, spawning the popular singles \"Legal Tender,\" \"Whammy Kiss,\" and \"Song for a Future Generation.\" The album entered the Billboard 200 twice in 1983, reaching both number 29 and 171 throughout the year, while \"Legal Tender\" reached the Billboard Hot 100 chart, as well as the Billboard Hot Dance Club Play Singles chart alongside its two respective singles. The band's goal with Whammy! was to update their signature sound with drum machines and synthesizers. The album was also the first to feature vocal performances by all five members of the band, as exemplified in \"Song for a Future Generation.\" On initial pressings of the album, the seventh track was \"Don't Worry,\" a cover version of the Yoko Ono song \"Don't Worry, Kyoko (Mummy's Only Looking for Her Hand in the Snow).\" However, the song was removed during later pressings due to legal issues. On subsequent pressings, the song was replaced with \"Legal Tender\"'s B-side, \"Moon 83,\" a remake of their earlier track \"There's a Moon in the Sky (Called the Moon).\" Reviewers generally treated Whammy! as weaker than their first two albums The B-52's and Wild Planet, but overall stronger than their previous album Mesopotamia."@en ;

Guitarist Paul Leary of Butthole Surfers, who co-produced Sublime's eponymous final album, produced it. Yours Truly met with critical acclaim at the time of its release and initially received positive reviews. \"Panic\" was released as the album's first single and it was successful, reaching No. 4 on Billboard's Alternative Songs and cracking the top 10 on the Rock Songs chart. \"Lovers Rock\" and \"Take It or Leave It\" were also released as singles. As of December 2011, Yours Truly is the only Sublime with Rome album recorded with co-founder Bud Gaugh, who has since left the band."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Youth is an album by American reggae singer Matisyahu, which was released on March 7, 2006. It is his second proper studio release, as Live at Stubb's is a live album. The CD quickly shot to the top of iTunes best sellers list the day it was released (partially because iTunes ran a special promotion for pre-orders). The first single from the album is \"King without a Crown\", which was also appeared on Matisyahu's previous album, Live at Stubb's. However, a different music video was shot for the Youth version of the song, whereas the version on the Stubb's concert album was accompanied by a concert video. The album debuted at number four on the Billboard 200 with over 119,000 copies sold in its first week released. A month later, the album was certified gold by the RIAA. As of September 24, 2008 the album has sold approximately 585,000 copies in the United States according to Nielsen Soundscan. On December 27, 2006, Billboard announced that Youth ranked 3rd overall on the 2006 Reggae album charts, immediately behind Live at Stubb's. The topic of the album is mostly the support and promotion of youth voice, more explicitly in the eponymous second track. The album, along with its topic, mixes Matisyahu's lyrics, which contain several references to his Jewish beliefs, with a mainstream sound."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Ys (pronounced /\u02C8i\u02D0s/ EESS) is the second album by Joanna Newsom. It was released by Drag City on November 6, 2006. The album was produced by herself and Van Dyke Parks, recorded by Steve Albini, mixed by Jim O'Rourke, with accompanying orchestral arrangements by Van Dyke Parks. It features guest vocals from Joanna's then boyfriend Bill Callahan and from her sister, Emily Newsom. The vocals and harp were recorded at The Village Recording Studio, LA in December 2005 with the orchestration being recorded between May and June 2006 at the Entorage Studios in LA. The album consists of 5 tracks with song durations ranging from 7 to 17 minutes that deal with events and people who had been important in Joanna's life in the year previous to recording. These events include the sudden death of Joanna's best friend, a continuing illness and a tumultuous relationship. The album was named after the mythical city of Ys, which according to myth was built on the coast of Brittany and later swallowed by the ocean. The albums' title was the last element to be confirmed and was a result of a dream that Joanna had which featured the letters Y and S and a book recommended by a friend that contained reference to the myth. Upon release Ys was met with widespread critical acclaim and was Joanna's first album to chart in the Billboard 200 where it peaked at No. 134, it also charted in the UK, France, Norway and Ireland. In recent years, the album has been featured on several music publications' lists of the greatest albums of the 2000s (decade) as well as all-time."@en ;

It featured rapper Mase, whose own career was at its peak during 1997. It broke into the top 20 on the Billboard 200 chart, and to date is McKnight's highest peaking album on the Top R&B Albums chart where it took the No. 1 position for three weeks. McKnight's track \"The Only One for Me\" appeared in the sitcom, Sister, Sister, in which McKnight dated Tia (Tia Mowry) and broke up with Tyreke (RonReaco Lee) in the season 6 episode, \"The Grass Is Always Greener\". The title track was an even bigger hit, reaching No. 6 on the Billboard Hot 100 Airplay chart in May 1998.

The album is the second part of the Body Talk trilogy, which consists of three mini-albums, all released during 2010. Robyn started working on songs for the album when Body Talk Pt. 1 (2010) was still in development, and she collaborated with Klas \u00C5hlund, Kleerup, Savage Skulls, Diplo, Snoop Dogg and Niggaracci. Musically, the songs on Body Talk Pt. 2 are upbeat and a mixture between electro, house, hip hop and disco. Critical reception of the album was generally positive. Although critics felt that it lacked a classic single and considered it a minor letdown compared to Body Talk Pt. 1, it received praise for being solid and club-ready. In Sweden, the album reached the top of the Sverigetopplistan chart. It also reached number one in Denmark and number three in Norway. In the United States, it peaked at number forty-one, becoming Robyn's highest position on the chart. \"Hang with Me\" was released as the album's only single in August 2010. An acoustic version of the song was featured on Body Talk Pt. 1. The single reached the top ten in Sweden and Norway. The last track on the album, \"Indestructible\", appears in acoustic form and was later remixed and served as the lead single for Body Talk, the final installment in the trilogy."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Heat Wave is the second album released by American Motown girl group Martha and the Vandellas. Released in 1963 on Motown's Gordy imprint, intended to capitialize on the success of the title track, which rose to number four on the pop singles chart and number-one on the R&B singles chart. The album was produced by the likes of Holland-Dozier-Holland (who composed the group's first five hit singles) and Mickey Stevenson. This was the last album to feature original Vandella Annette Beard. The material is composed almost entirely of cover versions of songs that were popular at the time. These range from pop tunes like \"Then He Kissed Me\" and \"My Boyfriend's Back\" to mainstream standards such as \"More\" (the theme from the 1962 film Mondo Cane) and \"Danke Schoen.\" The folk song \"If I Had a Hammer\" is also included as the Peter, Paul, and Mary version was big at the time. On its original release Heat Wave charted lowly at 125 on the U.S. albums chart."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Hold Me in Your Arms is the second album by the British pop singer Rick Astley, released in November 1988 on RCA Records serving as the follow-up to his debut album Whenever You Need Somebody. Like his previous albums, half the record was written and produced by Stock Aitken & Waterman, and the other half were Astley's own compositions produced by PWL associates Phil Harding, Ian Curnow and Daize Washbourn. The release of the album was delayed a few months due to a fire at PWL studios destroying some of Astley's recorded material. This would be Astley's last record with Stock, Aitken & Waterman, due to Astley wanting to leave behind the dance-pop sound of the producers, of wanting to shed his boy next door image, and wanting to focus on his original compositions on his albums, reappearing in 1991 with the soul album Free. The album spawned six singles. Unlike his previous album, where all the singles were Stock, Aitken & Waterman compositions and productions, Astley's compositions were also released as singles. The lead single, \"She Wants to Dance With Me\", was Astley's first single which he wrote himself, and became a worldwide top 10 hit. In Europe, \"Take Me to Your Heart\" and \"Hold Me in Your Arms\" were released as the next singles. \"Giving Up on Love\" was released as the second single off the album in the USA and Canada, and was later released in some countries of continental Europe as the fourth and last single off the album, and a cover of The Temptations' \"Ain't Too Proud to Beg\" was released as the third and last single in the USA and Japan. The album continued Astley's success, with the three UK singles becoming top 10 hits. While the record did not achieve the same level of sales as his debut album, it sold well all around the world, achieving Platinum and Gold certifications worldwide. A remastered version, containing all remixes, was released in 2010."@en ;

Taylor's first studio album in six years was released in 1997 to glowing notices.[citation needed] It built upon the success of his previous effort, New Moon Shine. Hourglass was an introspective album that earned Taylor his best critical reviews in almost twenty years. The album's lyrics focused largely on Taylor's troubled past and family. \"Jump Up Behind Me\" paid tribute to his father's rescue of him after The Flying Machine days, and the long drive from New York City back to his home in Chapel Hill. \"Enough to Be On Your Way\" was inspired by the alcoholism-related death of his brother Alex earlier in the decade. The themes were also inspired by Taylor's divorce from actress Kathryn Walker, which took place in 1996. Rolling Stone found that \"one of the themes of this record is disbelief\", while Taylor told the magazine that it was \"spirituals for agnostics.\" Critics embraced the dark themes on the album, and Hourglass was a huge commercial success, reaching #9 on the Billboard 200 (Taylor's first Top 10 album in sixteen years) and also provided a big adult contemporary hit on \"Little More Time With You\". The album also gave Taylor his first Grammy since JT, when he was honored with Best Pop Album in 1998. There is an Enhanced CD version of the album containing interviews, photos, and videos."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Never Let Me Down is the seventeenth studio album by David Bowie, released in April 1987 by EMI America. Bowie conceived the album as the foundation for a theatrical world tour, writing and recording most of the songs in Switzerland. He considered the record a return to rock 'n' roll music. Three singles were released from the album, \"Day-In Day-Out\", \"Time Will Crawl\" and \"Never Let Me Down\", the first two of which were top 10 hits around the world. One of Bowie's better-selling albums, Never Let Me Down was certified Gold by the RIAA in early July 1987, less than three months after its release date, and charted in the top 10 in several European countries, although it only reached number 34 on the US charts. Despite its commercial success, this album was poorly received by fans and critics, who often regard the mid-to-late 1980s as a low point of creativity and musical integrity for Bowie. Bowie later distanced himself from the album, but admitted a fondness for many of the songs and eventually remixed the track \"Time Will Crawl\" (one of his all-time favourites) for inclusion on his career retrospective release, iSelect (2008). In support of this album, Bowie embarked on the Glass Spider Tour, a world tour that was at that point the biggest, most theatrical and most elaborate tour he had undertaken in his career. The tour, like the album it supported, was commercially successful but critically panned. The critical failure of the album and tour were factors that led Bowie to look for a new way to motivate himself creatively, leading him to create the band Tin Machine in 1989 and to retire his back catalogue from live performances during his 1990 Sound+Vision Tour. Bowie did not release another solo album until Black Tie White Noise in 1993."@en ;

Instead, it was released on Gotee's imprint label, Mono Vs Stereo. Other than the instrumental \"The Bois D'arc Circus\" being added onto the end of \"Pulling Back The Skin\" to make one track, adding two new songs, and the cover art and title being changed, it is the same record. The other songs, with the exception of tracks 4 and 9 (which are the new songs featured on the re-issue) are the same recording of the previous album. The band calls this an album, but admits is not really an entirely new album. The band does play the song \"The Invisible Hook\" at shows, and the song is played on Christian radio stations, so the album has become as popular as their previous releases. In fact, the band often names this album rather than the previous album when referring to songs of this era."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Stay Alive is the sixth studio album by Filipino singer Nina, released in the Philippines on November 19, 2011 by Universal Records. After a long recording hiatus, Nina started working on a new album with her new label during the second half of 2010. She described the album's sound as \"sexy-soul,\" and stated that they wanted to show the \"other side\" [the dancer] of her by means of a dance album. The album covers a wide range of genres, consisting of upbeat house, dance songs, but still possessing Nina's distinctive mellow sound. Aside from keeping a close watch to the production and song arrangement, the singer also contributed to the album art when she designed the packaging together with her brother King. She described the new look as \"different, slightly futuristic and edgy.\" The album had a star-studded production. In August 2011, it was revealed that American singer-songwriter Keith Martin and Filipino R&B musician Jay R worked together on the upbeat title track \"Staying Alive\". Jazz singer and Nina's co-Sessionista Richard Poon wrote the acoustic ballad \"I Don't Want to Fight\" in late 2010, while R&B singer Amber Davis wrote the electropop-dance cuts \"Only with You\" and \"I Came to Dance\". Nina also wrote a song for the album together with Martin. The song was entitled \"You Should Know\". As she made sure to include an inspirational song about \"following your dreams,\" a Jude Gitamondoc-penned power ballad, later revealed to be entitled \"Believe in the Dream\", was included in the album's final track list. Stay Alive was a universal acclaim, being well-received by critics and fans alike. The Philippine Star tagged Nina as the \"new dance diva,\" and predicted that the album \"may set new trends in Filipino music.\" Philippine Entertainment Portal praised both the singer and the album, saying that the album is \"a testament to Nina's evolution as an artist\" and \"distinctly Nina.\" PhilCharts.com commented \"quite a risky move, commercial wise, but the product is solid [...] The album shows the potential of Nina to grow more as an artist.\" Stay Alive is supposed to be the first of her two-album recording deal with Universal. However, in February 2012, Nina revealed that her contract with the label has already expired. She also expressed her disappointment regarding the album's promotion, and how the label took no action for it. The album was later released on digital download through iTunes and Amazon.com MP3 Download with a slightly altered cover. The album was accompanied by three official singles. \"Dance\" was initially released in August 2011, but was immediately pulled out of the airwaves after the album's release date was pushed back. On October 6, 2011, the song was commercially released, and was later followed by a critically acclaimed music video. The video for \"Dance\" features Nina in Gaga-ish costumes, doing choreographed moves at the same time. She performed the song live in Happy Yipee Yehey! and Party Pilipinas, where she also launched the album. On January 30, 2012, \"However Much Love\" was released as the album's second single to boost up album sales. It also served as a radio-only Valentine single, since no video was recorded for the song. It became a commercial success, becoming Nina's first chart-topper since 2008. \"Believe in the Dream\" was released in April 2012 as the third official single from the album, accompanied by an official lyric video."@en ;

Slant Magazine listed the album at #71 on its list of \"Best Albums of the 1980s\". It is also included in the book 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die, Mojo magazine's \"Top 50 Eccentric Albums of All Time\" list and The Word magazine's \"Great Underrated Albums of Our Time\" list."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"The E.N.D (an abbreviation of The Energy Never Dies) is the fifth studio album by American hip hop group The Black Eyed Peas. It was released on June 3, 2009. Critics described the album as containing more anthemic and inspirational songs in the group's bid to appeal to a new generation of music listeners. Three promotional singles, \"Imma Be\", \"Alive\" and \"Meet Me Halfway\", were released through the iTunes Store in the three weeks running up to the album's release. The album gave the group their first, second, and third US number one hits with \"Boom Boom Pow\", \"I Gotta Feeling\", and \"Imma Be\" which topped the Billboard Hot 100 for 12, 14, and 2 weeks respectively. \"Boom Boom Pow\" and \"I Gotta Feeling\" led the Hot 100 back to back, putting the band at number 1 on the chart for a record breaking 26 consecutive weeks (half a year). The third single, \"Meet Me Halfway\", along with the first two, topped several charts around the world including the United Kingdom and Australia. As of June 2011, the album has sold over 11 million copies worldwide, making it one of the biggest commercial successes for the music industry in recent years. The E.N.D was nominated for six Grammy Awards in 2010, including Album of the Year, and Record of the Year for \"I Gotta Feeling\", and won the award for Best Pop Vocal Album."@en ;

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/The_Hunting_Party_(album)>	rdf:type	schema:MusicAlbum ;
	dbo:abstract	"The Hunting Party is the sixth studio album by American rock band Linkin Park. The album, produced by band members Mike Shinoda and Brad Delson, was released by Warner Bros. Records and Machine Shop on June 13, 2014. It is the first album since Meteora (2003) not to be produced with Rick Rubin, after producing the band's previous three studio albums. The title The Hunting Party is a contextual metaphor: Linkin Park is the party that is hunting to bring back the energy and soul of rock. The Hunting Party is a departure from the electronic rock sound of the band's previous two studio albums. The album, described by Shinoda as simply \"a rock record\", serves a statement by the band against contemporary mainstream and active rock bands, accused by him as \"trying to be other bands and playing it safe\". Packaged by an artwork by Brandon Parvini based on an original drawing by James Jean, the album took under a year to record and produce, with material being improvisationally written by the band. The album also features guest appearances from Page Hamilton of Helmet, Daron Malakian of System of a Down, Tom Morello of Rage Against the Machine, and Rakim, marking the first time Linkin Park has collaborated with other artists on a studio album. The album was promoted by the band and Warner Bros, with multiple promotional teasers and interviews produced and published in the lead-up to the album's release and listening parties of the album being held worldwide on multiple dates. The band embarked on the Carnivores Tour, a double-headline tour with Thirty Seconds to Mars, as well as The Hunting Party Tour, in support of the album. Five singles from The Hunting Party have been released; \"Guilty All the Same\" in March 2014, \"Until It's Gone\" in May 2014, and \"Wastelands\", \"Rebellion\" and \"Final Masquerade\" in June 2014. The album has received generally positive reviews, where it has been praised as bringing back the heavier rock sound resembling their older albums. It debuted at number three on Billboard 200, and has placed at number four on Revolver's list of \"The 20 Best Albums of 2014\"."@en ;

It is an instrumental progressive rock album with its concept based on his interpretations of the musical characteristics of the six wives of Henry VIII. Wakeman decided on the concept in 1972 while he toured the United States with the progressive rock band Yes. As he read a book about the wives on his travels, melodies he wrote the previous year came to him and were noted down. Musicians from Yes and Strawbs, who he performed with prior to Yes, also play on the album. The Six Wives of Henry VIII received mostly positive reviews from critics. It reached No. 7 on the UK Albums Chart and No. 30 on the US Billboard 200. It was certified Gold by the Recording Industry Association of America in 1975. In 2009, Wakeman performed the album live in its entirety for the first time at Hampton Court Palace as part of the 500th anniversary celebration of Henry's accession to the throne. Each track was re-scored with added elements that could not be there due to time restrictions on the vinyl record. The album was reissued in 2015 with a Quadrophonic sound mix and bonus tracks."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"12 Play is the debut studio album by American R&B and soul musician R. Kelly; it was released on November 9, 1993, by Jive Records. The album follows his tenure with R&B group Public Announcement, with whom he released one album, Born into the 90's (1992). It went on to top the R&B albums chart for nine weeks straight, while reaching the second position on the US Billboard 200 chart. The album features the sexually-themed singles \"Bump n' Grind\" (US; number 1), \"Your Body's Callin'\" (US; number 13), and the more overtly direct \"Sex Me, Pts. 1 & 2\" (US; number 20). The album serves as the first of a trilogy of albums Kelly later released under the \"12 Play\" moniker including TP-2.com (2000) and TP-3: Reloaded (2005). Since its initial mixed response from critics, 12 Play has received more favorable retrospective criticism. This album earned Kelly the title King of R&B."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"A Little More Personal (Raw) is the second studio album by American singer and actress Lindsay Lohan, released on December 5, 2005 by Casablanca Records. Initially titled There's Only One Angel In Heaven, the album, produced by Kara DioGuardi, Greg Wells, Ben Moody and Butch Walker, features darker material than Lohan's previous album, Speak (2004). Recording sessions took place in several locations, including at Lohan's trailer during the shoot of Herbie: Fully Loaded, where she recorded the first and only single of the album, \"Confessions of a Broken Heart (Daughter to Father)\". A Little More Personal (Raw) received mixed reviews from music critics, who praised Lohan's ambition, despite considering it a weak album. The album charted mildly compared to Speak, debuting (and also peaking) at number twenty on United States' Billboard 200 with first week sales of 82,000 copies, and also peaking at the same position on the Digital Albums chart. However, A Little More Personal (Raw) was certified Gold in the United States by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for sales of over 500,000 copies. It was also certified Gold in Taiwan. Lohan promoted the album with a few television appearances, including at MTV's Total Request Live, The Ellen DeGeneres Show and the 2005 American Music Awards."@en ;

It was first announced as being available exclusively at the June 9, 2006 Local H performance at the Metro in Chicago, but it has since been available at later shows as well as at G&P Records' web site. The demos were recorded in what the band refers to as 'The Last Golden Age of Demonstrations', the demo sessions for what would become their fourth album, 2002's Here Comes the Zoo. All of the songs from that album appear in demo form here, with the exception of \"5th Ave. Crazy\". Also, three of the songs from The No Fun EP, which were the only three songs that weren't covers on that release, appear here in demo form. The disc is rounded out by five songs which were all previously unreleased, with the exception of \"Halcion Daze\" which was previously released on a compilation, in the same form as it is here. That makes it the only song whose version appears on this album to have been previously released. Halcion Daze was completely re-written from the ground up and is now Halcyon Days, the last track on Whatever Happened to P.J. Soles. Foolish Notions is part of Here Comes the Zoo, but the title was changed to Bryn-Mawr Stomp."@en ;

Unlike the other Beatallica albums, the songs on this album have the original lyrics written by the Beatles, due to an imposition at Sony Music, the distributor of their label Oglio and owner of the Beatles' catalogue through Sony/ATV Music Publishing. Before, the lyrics were parodies such as \"Mean Mr. Mustaine\". Its title is a reference to the Beatles' album Abbey Road and Metallica's album Load. Abbey Road also provides the cover parody (referencing the image of the Beatles crossing Abbey Road in various ways, such as \"Kliff McBurtney\" wearing bear slippers, and a van with the plate \"28KLIFF\"), and most of the tracklist, with opener \"Come Together\" and the 16-minute medley on the album's Side B. Among the exclusions were \"I Want You (She's So Heavy)\" - which Beatallica had already spoofed as \"Ktulu (He's So Heavy)\" - and the George Harrison compositions \"Here Comes the Sun\" and \"Something\", denied the inclusion by his estate."@en ;

The album features the singles \"Never in a Million Years\", and the double A-side of \"I Wish You Well\" and \"This Time\". The lead single, \"Never in a Million Years\", was a fairly successful radio hit given the genre (Folk) Dillon's music is associated with. It spent six weeks on the BBC Radio 2 playlist, as well as the RT\u00C9 Radio One playlist, and was Record of the Week on BBC Radio Ulster. Due to a lack interest on the part of the record label (Rough Trade), the second single, \"This Time/I Wish You Well\" was cancelled. \"This Time\" was remixed with additional vocals, electric guitar and percussion for the single. The release date of the double A-side single was originally 31 July 2006, to coincide with Cambridge Folk Festival (which Dillon was to perform at) but was changed to 14 August 2006 and finally the release was cancelled."@en ;

Unusually for a punk rock/new wave group, the album featured several sixties covers, \"Glad All Over\" (originally a hit for the Dave Clark Five), \"Somebody's Gonna Get Their Head Kicked In Tonight\" (originally by Fleetwood Mac) and \"I Like It\", a Gerry & the Pacemakers hit. The record reached number 16 in the UK Albums Chart. Trouser Press called the band \"a blast of fresh air compared to the more serious bands of new wave's first charge\" and praised the album as \"an action-packed document of their pop/camp approach\". In 1994, All Time Top 1000 Albums named Can't Stand the Rezillos one of the 50 best punk albums of all time. The compilers claimed that the Rezillos were \"exuberant almost to the point of hysteria\" creating \"a body of work full of verve, style and humour\", which this album \"encapsulates to perfection\".

I wanted to capture the intimacy and simplicity of the self-titled EP, but at the same time make a more adventurous record. Plus some of the songs were really calling for an elaborate treatment. This was sometimes difficult to balance, but I think it helped create a nice diversity about the album.

	dbo:abstract	"Communards is the debut album by The Communards, released in 1986 (see 1986 in music) on London Records. The album was produced by Mike Thorne, who had previously produced Jimmy Somerville's earlier band, Bronski Beat. Although the singles released ahead of the album were only moderately successful, the first single to be lifted from it after release, \"Don't Leave Me This Way\", was number one in the UK for four weeks and was the top-selling single in the UK that year. During the single's four-week run at number one, the album itself reached a chart peak of number seven, going on to spend a total of 45 weeks in the UK Albums Chart. Musically, the album contains tracks that largely fall into one of two styles, either Hi-NRG (all of the singles lifted from the album were in this style) or piano ballads showcasing the talents of Richard Coles, a classically trained pianist. The standard \"Lover Man\" is arranged as a straight jazz number, albeit with the unusual twist of being performed as a duet. The front sleeve features a stark graphic design consisting of the group's name and logo against a black background. A photo of the duo appears on the back, while the inner sleeve features small photos of Coles, Somerville and Sarah Jane Morris, alongside the album credits and full lyrics for all the songs. Two songs had dedications in the sleevenotes: \"Don't Leave Me This Way\" was dedicated to the GLC, and \"Reprise\" to Margaret Hilda Thatcher."@en ;

This is sometimes labeled The Silver Album because of its metallic glam rock style cover. In 2000 Buddah Records re-released the album with two bonus tracks (\"What's Important to Me\" and \"Ice\"). It featured an album cover in which Daryl and John are overly made up with make-up to the point where they looked like women. Hall would later say in an interview for VH1's Behind the Music that he looked like \"the girl I always wanted to go out with\" on that album cover. \"Grounds For Separation\", according to Daryl Hall, was going to be used in the Sylvester Stallone movie Rocky. Frank Stallone, Sylvester's brother, had been in a band with John Oates called Valentine and this connection got them a shot at an appearance on the soundtrack. The movie, however, was slow to get off the ground, and Hall and Oates withdrew the song. \"Alone Too Long\" is the theme song for the television show Hello Ladies, which premiered on HBO in 2013. \"Gino (The Manager)\" is about the duo's manager at the time. The record jacket insert reads \"And introducing Tommy Mottola as 'Little Gino.' \" In 2009, the song was remixed and included on the duo's 4-CD box set Do What You Want, Be What You Are. In 2009, Sony Music Custom Marketing Group released a triple pack of Hall & Oates albums. Along with this album, the pack included H2O and Ooh Yeah!."@en ;

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dusty..._Definitely>	rdf:type	schema:MusicAlbum ;
	dbo:abstract	"Dusty... Definitely is the fourth studio album by singer Dusty Springfield, recorded and released in the UK in 1968. Production credits go to both John Franz, and for the first time, Springfield herself. The songs on this album were chosen because Springfield \"liked them\", as stated in the liner notes. Like the vast majority of her LPs, the album shows a diverse range of styles ranging from soul (\"Take Another Little Piece of my Heart\"), pop (\"This Girl's in Love With You\"), folk (\"Morning (Bom Dia)\") to lounge (\"Who (Will Take my Place?)\"). The two sides of the album reflected very different moods: the first side was packed with fast-paced, louder numbers, while the second side was more mellow, which Springfield suggested would be suitable for listening to at night. In 1968, Springfield entered into a contract with Atlantic Records for the United States, which meant that the singer had a different record label for each side of the Atlantic (previously she had been signed to Philips both in the UK and the USA). Springfield's new contract allowed Philips in the UK to release American recordings and Atlantic in the USA to release British recordings. This was the first LP to be covered by this agreement. Atlantic was however reluctant to release any British recordings on their label; thus, the album was never released in the States. Tracks from this album were finally released in the USA in 1999 (the year of Springfield's death) on the Rhino Records compilation Dusty in London. In the UK Dusty... Definitely was first released to CD by Philips Records/PolyGram in the early 1990s and in 2001 Mercury Records/Universal Music Group re-released a digitally remastered edition with four bonus tracks."@en ;

It was released as an independent digital album on October 1, 2014 by Maximum10 and Avex Music Creative Inc.. After releasing a digital EP Astroboy in April 2014, Avex announced new material from the group. The album's production was handled by several music producers and songwriters, such as Dan Book, Alexei Misoul, Leah Haywood, Daniel James, Kevin Ross, Andreas Carlsson, and Dreamlab. It also features a guest appearance from FEMM's alter-egos; the managers Honey-B and W-Trouble. Performed in English language, Femm-Isation is primarily an electronic dance album with numerous elements of pop ballad, disco, and eurodance. Upon its release, Femm-Isation was met with generally positive reviews from music critics, many of whom complimented the commercial appeal of the songs and group, and praised the lyrical and musical delivery. However, some critics singled out some tracks that weren't good. Commercially, Femm-Isation was unsuccessful. The album failed to chart on the Japanese Oricon Albums Chart due to their policy of restricting digital sales and releases, and failed to chart on any competent Japanese Billboard Albums charts. The album managed to chart for a sole week on the US Billboard World Albums Chart at 10. Femm-Isation spawned thirteen promotional singles, and eight digital singles. Despite no chart positions, the singles: \"Kill the DJ\" and \"Fxxk Boyz Get Money\" achieved viral status because of the songs musical and lyrical delivery, along with its music video aesthetics. Because of this, several online figures and websites begun spreading the songs and the group virally. FEMM promoted the album on several live performances and concert gigs. In February 2016, Femm-Isation will be re-released physically as a double album with the groups subsequent release P.o.W.!/LCS (2016)."@en ;

Produced by Neal Avron, the album was recorded from July to September 2008 at The Pass Studios and The Casita in Hollywood, California. As the follow-up to the band's commercially successful 2007 effort Infinity on High, it was released by Island Records on December 10, 2008, after the original November 4 release was postponed to avoid conflicts with the United States presidential election. Like the band's two previous releases, Folie \u00E0 Deux was musically composed by lead vocalist and guitarist Patrick Stump, with lyrics penned by bassist Pete Wentz. In regard to the writing process, the band considered Folie \u00E0 Deux to be their most collaborative record at the time. The album was recorded in relative secrecy compared to the press that its predecessor possessed. The recording sessions inspired lyricism that related to decaying relationships, moral dilemmas, and societal shortcomings, many with a political edge. It is the first Fall Out Boy album with lyrics that are less autobiographical. The album's style moved away from early emo power chords and toward a wider variation in genre. Fall Out Boy recruited several guest artists for Folie \u00E0 Deux, as well as employing instruments and recording techniques previously unfamiliar to the group. To promote the album, the band launched a viral campaign based around a Big Brother-type organization named \"Citizens For Our Betterment\" (CFOB) and embarked on an extensive tour schedule. Folie \u00E0 Deux was released in the United States on December 16, 2008, and received favorable reviews from most music critics, although fan opinions were mixed. Positive reviews focused on the creativity and various styles touched on, while the more negative reviews expressed concern that the record was overly indulgent. The album debuted at number eight on the US Billboard 200 chart with 149,000 first week sales but was less commercially successful than Infinity on High. As of February 2013 Folie \u00E0 Deux has sold 449,000 copies in the US. It was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) after 500,000 copies were shipped. The album spawned four singles. \"I Don't Care\", the first single, reached number 21 on the Billboard Hot 100 and was certified platinum. Folie \u00E0 Deux was Fall Out Boy's last studio album released before the band's 2009\u201313 hiatus."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"From janet. to Damita Jo: The Videos is the third music video release by American singer-songwriter Janet Jackson. It was released on September 6, 2004 by Virgin Records, following the debut of Jackson's eighth studio album, Damita Jo. The anthology contains music videos from her first four studio albums released on Virgin Records. It also includes several live performances, the filming of \"All Nite (Don't Stop),\" an exclusive album interview, and photo gallery. The compilation received positive reviews from critics, who commended Jackson's visual evolution throughout her career. It was also thought to depict the huge influence she has become on younger artists, observed to emulate the \"controversial pop superstar\". Jackson's choreography and sexual allure were also subjects of recognition. Following her Super Bowl Halftime Show incident, inclusions from Jackson's Damita Jo album were blacklisted on music channels and radio stations owned by Viacom, CBS and Clear Channel Communications due to receiving fines from the U.S. Federal Communications Commission."@en ;

Nicholson said that \"Writing was a product of our environment, something that happened in and around our daily lives. And something that getting to know the Chambers family has shown me is a beautiful way to make music.\" \"We didn't want a duets album, where people come together for a vocal collaboration and go on their way. We wanted an album that sounds like a band with two singers in it. It feels that way to us. And we hope it feels that way to the people who hear it too.\" states Chambers again. The album debuted at number-one on the Australian ARIA Albums Chart on 28 April 2008 with sales of 8,965 copies, knocking Apocalypso by The Presets off the top spot. The following week the album was knocked off the top spot by Madonna with her album Hard Candy, and fell to number four. In October 2008, the album won Best Country Album at the 2008 ARIA Awards.

The album reached Number 1 on the World Music Charts Europe (WMCE) on March 2010. \"Shouka\", the central song that titles the album, is a new experience in the Sahrawi music, as it is structured as a cantata. Taking the verses of Sahrawi poet Lamine Allal, Hassan developed a nine paragraph critical response to the 1976 speech of then Spanish opposition leader and later president of Spain Felipe Gonz\u00E1lez at the Sahrawi refugee camps (he compromised Spanish Socialist Workers' Party support to the Sahrawi people until \"the final victory\"), by using all scales and rhythms of the Haul. In this work, Mariem's group is completed with Lamgaifri Brahim (lead guitar) and Vadiya Mint El Hanevi (tbal, choruses and dances). Several other musicians contributed to the album, as Senegalese Malick Diaw (guitar), Spanish Kepa Os\u00E9s (bass), Hugo Westerdahl (bass), Josemi S\u00E1nchez (guitar) and Jaime Mu\u00F1oz (flutes), Iranian Behnam Samani (daf & tombak) and Davood Varzideh (ney), and Cuban-Haitian Mel Seme (percusionist)."@en ;

It was originally supposed to be a track title, but he decided to use it for the album's name. Bibio is also the name of a fishing fly, while his real name is Stephen Wilkinson.

The album was supplemented with six previously released recordings by the American session group The Titans. Packaged in an attempt to capitalize on The Beatles' success, the record was only moderately successful, as the album peaked at only #68 on the Billboard album chart. It was released by MGM Records in both mono (catalogue number E-4215) and rechanneled stereo (SE-4215.) MGM augmented the six Sheridan/Beatles tracks with six instrumental tracks by the Danny Davis and The Titans, a group of New York session musicians built around guitarist Bill Mure. The Titans also included Don Lomond on drums, Dick Hickson on bass trombone, and Milt \"the Judge\" Hinton on bass. The six Titans tracks had been previously released on the 1961 MGM album, Let's Do the Twist for Adults. (On the original release, the songs \"Flying Beat,\" \"Rye Beat,\" \"Summertime Beat,\" and \"Happy New Beat\" were originally titled, \"Flying Twist,\" \"Rye Twist,\" \"Summertime Twist\" and \"Happy New Year Twist.\")"@en ;

dbr:The_Complete_Bitches_Brew_Sessions	rdf:type	schema:MusicAlbum ;
	dbo:abstract	"The Complete Bitches Brew Sessions is a four-disc box set of music recordings by trumpeter Miles Davis. The set collects all tracks Davis recorded between August 19, 1969 and February 6, 1970, including the 1970 double album Bitches Brew in its entirety. However, the title of the box set is somewhat of a misnomer: outside of the Bitches Brew tracks themselves, none of the other tracks were recorded during the same August 1969 sessions that resulted in Bitches Brew. Furthermore, additional material recorded for, but not used in Bitches Brew (mainly rehearsal takes and unedited performances of the six album tracks), is not included in this set (though they later appeared on bootleg recordings titled Deep Brew Vol. 1 and Vol. 2). When questioned by Paul Tingen why most of the material in fact was not recorded either for or at the same sessions as the original album, re-issue producer Bob Belden clarified how the team's thought process went. According to him and the engineer, all the songs Miles Davis recorded between August 1969 and early February 1970 used very similar line-ups to those on Bitches Brew, and the main thing they all had in common was the emphasis on keyboards. Every song in the set includes two to three keyboard players, most often Chick Corea, Joe Zawinul and Herbie Hancock. It wasn't until late February 1970 that Davis refined his concept by dropping the multiple electric pianists for a more guitar-heavy sound. Those following sessions were collected on The Complete Jack Johnson Sessions. The box set includes some tracks that had never been previously released, one of which, the Wayne Shorter composition \"Feio,\" has since appeared as a bonus track on late compact disc reissues of Bitches Brew. A few of the other tracks in the box set had previously appeared on the albums Live-Evil, Big Fun, and Circle in the Round. The Complete Bitches Brew Sessions is chronologically number \"6\" in a series of Miles Davis box sets issued by Columbia Records/Legacy Records/Sony Music (the numbering scheme refers to the chronological order of the original recordings, not the release order of the box sets themselves). The set was reissued on 11 May 2004 with new packaging."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Towncraft was a compilation LP documenting the punk scene of Little Rock, Arkansas and released by DIY record labels File Thirteen Records, Ahoalton Records, and Lower Case Records. In the summer of 1992, Little Rock saw an explosion of high school punk rock bands after the departures of locals Trusty in 1991 and Econochrist in 1989. A number of youth felt it necessary to document the scene. After several meetings at Denny's with an attendance of over 30 adolescents, Towncraft was born. Heavily influenced by the DIY ethic, youth run garage sales, bake sales, benefit shows, and a handful of generous donators would come together to put the record out. The 500 copies of Towncraft, sold for $6 each, and were accompanied by a compilation zine, which included entries from 12 different local zines. Jason White, who was in Chino Horde and co-writer of Fluke zine, went on to play with Green Day starting in 1997, and is currently a member of Pinhead Gunpowder, Green Day, and The Big Cats. Colin Brooks, who was in Substance, Sint, and G, played guitar in Red 40 alongside Ben Nichols (current front man of Lucero) and currently plays in The Big Cats and Dan Zanes. The album is highlighted in a 2007 documentary also titled Towncraft and is not to be confused with the soundtrack which also contains songs by bands from the original album."@en ;

Rutledge has described the album as having been inspired by the process of remastering and rereleasing his debut album, 2004's No Never Alone, in 2012. During the process, he decided to make a new album that revisited the themes and creative inspirations of No Never Alone, this time from his contemporary perspective as an older, more mature adult, and a more experienced musician, revisiting his life at the time of the original album via memory. To that end, the album includes two songs, \"Kapuskasing Coffee\" and \"Heather in the Pines\", which he began writing around the time of the original album, but set aside and never finished until the recording sessions for Valleyheart; he has described the two songs as \"co-writes with my younger self and older self\", and the full album as \"a response to that young kid who just wrote what he felt\". British singer-songwriter Carina Round provides backing vocals on several songs. The iTunes edition of the album includes three exclusive bonus tracks, cover versions of Bob Dylan's \"Tomorrow Is a Long Time\", Ewan MacColl's \"Dirty Old Town\" and The Tragically Hip's \"Nautical Disaster\". Around the time of the album's release, Rutledge also recorded a performance video of \"Nautical Disaster\" for the website Southern Souls. In 2014, Rutledge released Spring Is a Girl, an EP which collected these three tracks along with a cover of the Tragically Hip's \"Bobcaygeon\" which was recorded for but not included on his 2014 album Daredevil, for sale on the Canadian web label Zunior. The album won the Juno Award for Roots & Traditional Album of the Year \u2013 Solo in 2014."@en ;

Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band and Magical Mystery Tour), with a few new additions; most notably vocal distortion, more backwards instruments, and some obscure musical instruments such as electric sitars. The Juno-nominated album cover was painted by a friend of Klaatu's members, the Canadian graphic artist, Ted Jones. For a variety of reasons, rumours spread in the wake of the album's release that Klaatu were, in fact, a secretly reunited Beatles. The album was moderately successful in the United States, largely as a result of the Beatles rumours. A high-quality newly remastered version of the album was released on Klaatu's indie record label \"Klaatunes\" in 2011.

	dbo:abstract	"Afrodisiac is the fourth studio album by American recording artist Brandy, released on June 28, 2004 by Atlantic Records. The album was recorded primarily in Los Angeles between spring 2003 and early 2004, following several major changes in Brandy's personal and professional life. After giving birth to her daughter and the demise of her relationship with the father, Brandy's team was given an overhaul, including changes in production, management, and A&R. The album marked a departure from her previous work, with Brandy collaborating with producer Timbaland and songwriter Candice Nelson, on the majority of the album's composition. With many of their new relationships being the result of broken ones, Brandy and Timbaland were inspired to experiment with a number of sounds and influences to create a unique, individualized sound that was distinct from other R&B music. The result was an organic, mellow contemporary R&B album that experimented with the New York-based illbient style, which infuses eccentric hip-hop breakbeats, ambient soundscapes, and the unorthodox sampling of indie rock and various film scores. Brandy also continued to experiment with her singing, opting to use more technical applications of counterpoint and multi-track recording toward her vocal arrangements. An autobiographical album, the songs feature intimate lyrics which discuss the singer's personal struggles with codependency, monogamy, misplaced loyalty, and professional anxiety. Upon release, the critical response to Afrodisiac was highly positive, eventually garnering critical acclaim for its mature lyrics, Brandy's vocalizing, and its overall experimental sound. The album has been named as one of a predecessors to PBR&B and alternative R&B, having been cited to influence artists, such as Rihanna and Solange. Afrodisiac was nominated for several awards including nominations at the 2004 MTV Video Music Awards and the 47th Annual Grammy Awards. The album debuted at number three on the US Billboard 200, eventually earning a gold certification by the RIAA. Internationally, Afrodisiac scored minor success, appearing on the top 40 album charts in the UK, Canada, and Japan. The album spawned three singles \u2014 \"Talk About Our Love\", \"Who Is She 2 U\" and \"Afrodisiac\"."@en ;

The album was produced by Steve Lillywhite, with additional production from Flood, Jacknife Lee, Nellee Hooper, Chris Thomas, Daniel Lanois, Brian Eno, and Carl Glanville. U2 lead singer Bono described the album as \"our first rock album.

Love and war, peace and harmony, and approaching death are themes of the album. How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb and its singles won all nine Grammy Awards for which they were nominated (U2 themselves were awarded eight out of the nine).

Like those albums, it was well received by critics. The original 12\" version was pressed on sky-blue vinyl. The four track collection weaved the pair's now familiar motifs of nature, childhood and madness around a central theme: the Branch Davidian religious sect and their Waco retreat. The second track is named after Amo Bishop Roden, the widow of a rival of David Koresh. Roden reoccupied the Waco site after its destruction, sleeping in a ditch near the property until federal authorities who had been keeping her away finally abandoned it. The EP's title refers to the one line of vocals around which the work is based, a vocoder-processed and slowed voice sample (said to be Roden): come out and live in a religious community in a beautiful place out in the country. The EP's artwork features blurred and fragmentary photos of the compound and Davidians, including the aforementioned Roden and the eye of David Koresh. The Davidians theme returns on the group's subsequent album, 2002's Geogaddi. The title track was covered by Mira Calix for the Warp Records compilation Warp20 (Recreated) in 2009."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Pretty on the Inside is the debut studio album by American alternative rock band Hole, released on September 17, 1991 in the United States on Caroline Records. Produced by Sonic Youth's Kim Gordon, and Gumball frontman Don Fleming, the album was Hole's first major label release after the band's formation in 1989 by singer-songwriter Courtney Love and lead guitarist Eric Erlandson. The album features distorted and alternating guitar compositions, screaming vocals, \"shock value\" lyrics, and \"sloppy punk ethics\", a style which the band would later distance themselves from, opting for a less abrasive sound on their subsequent releases. Love's lyrics on the album are often narrative, graphic, and abstract, detailing issues of violence, self-realization, and womanhood. The record was dedicated to Rob Ritter of the Los Angeles punk rock acts Bags and The Gun Club. Pretty on the Inside was well received by alternative music critics, garnering favorable reviews in Spin, NME, and The Village Voice. It received considerable commercial success in the United Kingdom, where the record's lead single, \"Teenage Whore,\" entered the UK Indie Chart at number one in September 1991. It has sold over 200,000 copies in the United States and gained a contemporary cult following among punk rock fans, and has been cited as a seminal influence for songwriters and musicians such as Brody Dalle and Scout Niblett. Despite its critical acclaim, frontwoman Courtney Love has, in later years, referred to the album as \"unlistenable.\" An LP version of the album was reissued in the United States in August 2011 to celebrate its twentieth anniversary."@en ;

It was the last original studio recording from the 1990s featuring Brian May, Roger Taylor and John Deacon (and the first ever Queen recording without the lead singer Freddie Mercury). The album is unique to the Queen catalogue, as it deliberately does not follow the standard \"greatest hits\" collection format. Some hits are present (\"We Will Rock You\", \"I Want It All\" and \"Fat Bottomed Girls\"), while other tracks included were never released as singles anywhere (\"Put Out the Fire\", \"Tear It Up\" and \"Sheer Heart Attack\").

The record reached number 3 in the UK Albums Chart and includes the singles \"Juxtapozed with U\", \"(Drawing) Rings Around the World\" and \"It's Not the End of the World?\". The album, which singer Gruff Rhys describes as \"a very ambitious project\", was recorded between April and September 2000 at Monnow Valley Studios in Rockfield, Monmouthshire, Wales and Bearsville Studios, New York with the band acting as co-producers alongside Chris Shaw. The majority of the songs on Rings Around the World were written by Rhys on guitar and piano with keyboardist Cian Ciaran contributing \"[A] Touch Sensitive\" and \"Miniature\" as well as collaborating with other members of the band on \"Run! Christian, Run!\", \"Alternate Route to Vulcan Street\" and \"No Sympathy\". Ex-Beatle Paul McCartney and former Velvet Underground member John Cale make cameo appearances on the album. Musically Rings Around the World is an eclectic record incorporating pop, prog, punk, jungle, electronica, techno and death metal. Rhys has offered several explanations of the album's lyrical content, claiming the record is \"about Earth, and the pollution of space\" and also that it addresses the human condition. Critics meanwhile have referred to the record as \"thematically eccentric\" and lacking an \"overarching theme\". Critical reception was generally positive, with the album being nominated for 2001's Mercury Music Prize and placing at number one in Mojo's \"best albums of 2001\" feature. Some reviews claimed it to be the best record of the band's career although the NME described it as the band's worst album."@en ;

It is their first proper album release since 1998's Tin Planet. The tracks \"Zombies\", \"Suburban Rock 'N' Roll\" and \"20 Million Miles from Earth\" were released as singles, all of them failing to reach top 40. For this album Space ditched the polished, commercial-friendly sound that inhabited Tin Planet and Love You More than Football and returned to the darker style of their debut Spiders. Tommy Scott's lyrical themes also changed, as they aim to move away from the character-driven lyrics of old and are a lot more impressionist, with songs dealing with death, crime and surveillance amongst other serious and controversial themes. The band also reunited with Spiders' producer Stephen Lironi, who is credited as songwriter of a few tracks, though Scott has insisted he wrote all the material himself. Suburban Rock 'N' Roll is the first Space album with no techno/electronic instrumentals from Franny Griffiths, as the band wanted the album to be more song-oriented. The album was not a great success, as public interest had waned in the band almost six years previously, and promotion for the record was almost non-existent. Despite the failure of both album and singles, the album remains a favourite amongst fans, with even former band member Jamie Murphy dubbing it the \"best Space album\"."@en ;

The album was designed so that when played simultaneously on four separate audio systems, the four CDs would produce a harmonic or juxtaposed sound. The discs can also be played in different combinations, omitting one, two or three discs. The album's title is a portmanteau of two words: Zaire, chosen as a symbol of anarchy after Wayne Coyne heard a radio news story about the political instability of the African nation, and eureka (literally: \"I have found it\"), an expression of joyous discovery. Zaireeka was the first album made by the band since the departure of guitarist Ronald Jones.

The album peaked at number 1 on Billboard's \"Top New Age Albums\" chart and at number 5 on the \"Billboard 200\" chart in the same year. The film spent 229 weeks on Billboard's \"Top Music Video\" charts and \"Top VHS sales\" charts, and received an Emmy nomination in 1994 for \"Outstanding Individual Achievement in Lighting Direction (Electronic) for a Drama Series, Variety Series, Miniseries or a Special\". In a three-year television deal with the Public Broadcasting Service (PBS), the live television special was one of the top fund-raising subjects for PBS, raising $13 million, with more than 750,000 home videos and more than 7 million albums sold worldwide. It has been seen in 65 countries by half a billion people, and is the second-best-selling music video of all time (behind Michael Jackson's video for Thriller with 9 million units). The composition \"Acroyali/Standing in Motion\" from this album was determined to have the \"Mozart Effect\" by the Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine because it was similar to Mozart'sK 448 in tempo, structure, melodic and harmonic consonance and predictability.

Garth Hudson's organ solo, \"Too Wet to Work\", and the plainly titled \"Jam\" come from the actual Watkins Glen concert, as does the introduction of the group by Bill Graham. The former track appears on the out-of-print 1994 box set Across The Great Divide, but the latter track is only present on the Watkins Glen disc. Other than those two tracks, the remainder of the tracks are actually outtakes from various studio sessions by the Band with overdubbed crowd noise to create the impression that the material was recorded at the Watkins Glen concert. \"Back to Memphis\" and \"Endless Highway\" are available on the 2001 re-release of Moondog Matinee, without the crowd overdubs. The rest of the tracks are available on the 2001 two-CD re-release of Rock of Ages as \"previously unavailable\" tracks, with the exception of \"Don't Ya Tell Henry\", which is replaced with an alternate cut featuring Bob Dylan. The true background of the album was revealed in the liner notes of the remastered Moondog Matinee CD. The following quote is from the 2001 liner notes, \"Chuck Berry's Going Back To Memphis, on the other hand, was completed and ready for inclusion on the album Moondog Matinee but ended up being shelved in favor of Promised Land. This version has been released before complete with overdubbed audience sounds as the opening track on the fraudulent Live at Watkins Glen CD. No one in the Band was connected with that particular release which had been originally mastered sometime in the late 1970s or early 1980s, although not released until 1995.

The album also contains guitar riffs courtesy of Limp Bizkit guitarist Wes Borland (who also co-produced three tracks) and vocal talents by beatboxer Rahzel. Its title is likely a reference to the supervillain team Legion of Doom. An edited version of \"Born Too Slow\" was featured in the soundtrack for the video games Need for Speed: Underground and Donkey Konga 2. The song \"I Know It's You\" was used in the pilot episode of the TV show Numb3rs. Also, the song \"Bound Too Long\" was featured on the soundtrack to the movie Cursed (film), and \"Starting Over\" was used in an episode of the TV show Alias and an episode of CSI: Crime Scene Investigation. A different version of \"Weapons of Mass Distortion\", renamed \"Weapons of Mad Distortion\", was used in the movie Blade: Trinity. The design of the album is not completely standard. As opposed to most album layouts, the tracks of Legion were listed on the front of the case, rather than on the back, with the album art placed on the back inlay.
