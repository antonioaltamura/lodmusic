	dbo:abstract	"Against Me! is an American punk rock band formed in Gainesville, Florida, United States, in 1997 by singer and guitarist Laura Jane Grace. Since 2001, the band's lineup has also included guitarist James Bowman. After releasing three studio albums through independent record labels, Against Me! moved to Sire Records for 2007's New Wave, which reached no. 57 on the Billboard 200. In 2011, the band launched their own record label, Total Treble Music, through which to release future albums. In 2012, Grace publicly came out as transgender, beginning a transition to living as a woman and dropping her birth name. After a long period of line-up changes and uncertainty surrounding the band's future, their sixth studio album, Transgender Dysphoria Blues, was released independently in January 2014 to critical and commercial acclaim. The band's seventh full-length, Shape Shift with Me, was released September 16 2016."@en ;

The group achieved success when the producers of hit TV series The Sopranos chose the track \"Woke Up This Morning\" for the show's opening credits. The band is notable for their fusion of styles, ironic lyrics, intentionally humorous personae, and outrageous live performances.

	dbo:abstract	"Alkaline Trio is an American punk rock band from McHenry, Illinois. The band consists of guitarist and vocalist Matt Skiba, bassist and vocalist Dan Andriano, and drummer Derek Grant. Founded in late 1996 by Skiba, bassist Rob Doran, and drummer Glenn Porter, Alkaline Trio released its debut single, \"Sundials\", in 1997. Following its release, Doran departed from the band and was replaced by Dan Andriano. The band subsequently recorded an EP, For Your Lungs Only (1998), and its debut studio album, Goddamnit (1998). Following the release of the band's second album, Maybe I'll Catch Fire (2000), Porter left the band and was replaced by Mike Felumlee for its subsequent album, From Here to Infirmary (2001). Backed by the singles \"Stupid Kid\" and \"Private Eye\", From Here to Infirmary significantly increased the band's exposure, and its follow-up, Good Mourning (2003), charted highly on the Billboard 200. Good Mourning marked the recording debut of current drummer Derek Grant. In 2005, the band released Crimson which expanded upon the band's punk rock influences, with prominent overdubs and additional instrumentation, and continued with this direction on Agony & Irony (2008), which was released on V2 Records. In 2010, the band released This Addiction on its own label Heart & Skull and Epitaph. Recorded in the band's home town of Chicago, with early producer Matt Allison, the album was a conscious effort by the band to return to their punk rock roots; it became the highest charting album of their career, debuting on the Billboard 200 at No. 11. In 2011, the band celebrated its 15-year anniversary with the release of Damnesia, which featured new, acoustic-based recordings of songs from across the band's career. The band's eighth studio album, My Shame Is True, was released on April 2, 2013."@en ;

The line-up consists of singers and guitarists Vincent and Daniel Cavanagh, their brother Jamie Cavanagh at bass, siblings John and Lee Douglas, respectively drummer and singer, and keyboardist Daniel Cardoso since November 2012. The band was founded as Pagan Angel in 1990 by the three Cavanagh siblings, John, and singer Darren White, as a death/doom band. At the time White was the only singer of the band. The following year, Jamie left and was replaced by Duncan Patterson. Under this line-up, Anathema released their first EP, The Crestfallen (1992), and their first album, Serenades (1993). However, White left in 1995; Vincent decided to act as Anathema's vocalist in addition to his guitarist function in the albums The Silent Enigma (1995) and Eternity (1996), which were going into a more gothic metal direction. In 1997, John left the band, and was replaced by Shaun Steels for the album Alternative 4 (1998). Both Patterson and Steels left the same year, replaced by Dave Pybus and a returning John Douglas, while former My Dying Bride keyboardist and violinist Martin Powell also joined the band (Daniel Cavanagh was also acting as the band's only keyboardist, and shared this position since). The only album released with this line-up was Judgement (1999): the same year Powell switched positions with Cradle of Filth's keyboardist Les Smith who joined Anathema, and Lee Douglas, John's sister, was added to the line-up as a backing and occasional lead vocalist. The band released their sixth album A Fine Day to Exit in 2001, turning to an alternative sound. Shortly after the release, Pybus announced his departure and was replaced by the band's original bassist, Jamie Cavanagh, reuniting the three brothers in the band for the first time since 1991. There were no new members for the next ten years, with the albums A Natural Disaster (2003) and We're Here Because We're Here (2010) all being recorded and released by the same line-up, with the sound turning even more towards progressive rock; however, Daniel Cavanagh left Anathema in 2002 to join Antimatter, returning in 2003. Smith left Anathema in 2011, and Vincent and Daniel both assumed the function of keyboardist for the band's ninth album, Weather Systems, in 2012. The same year, Cardoso, the band's live keyboardist since 2011, joined as a full-time member. The band's tenth studio album called Distant Satellites was released on 9 June 2014 via Kscope."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Ancient is a Norwegian black metal band from Bergen, formed in 1992. The band released six full-length albums released by Metal Blade Records to date and a variety of mini-albums, EPs and special releases. Ancient used to have the classic raw black metal sound, similar to Darkthrone's works. Beginning with The Cainian Chronicle, they moved towards a more Nordic/atmospheric black metal sound, akin to Emperor and a cleaner production. After a period of turmoil concerning their line-up, they went on to add gothic-style instruments such as violins, a female vocalist, and synthesizers to their music. To this day Ancient can be considered as one of the original Norwegian black metal bands that were part of the now famous scene of the early nineties. They were one of the very first Norwegian black metal bands to sign for a semi-major label (Metal Blade Records). There is no evidence of any involvement of Ancient with the infamous occurrences of the Norwegian black metal scene, although they were part of the same scene. Ancient can be considered as a historical black metal act by all standards, whose path took a different course upon their relocation around the world and subsequent exit from the local Norwegian scene."@en ;

After the success of their full debut the band recruited Charlotte Hatherley as a guitarist and vocalist, releasing their second record Nu-Clear Sounds in 1998. After narrowly avoiding bankruptcy the band released Free All Angels in 2001 and a string of successful singles. Their fourth record Meltdown, released in 2004, was the band's final record with Hatherley before returning to their original three-piece lineup for their fifth studio album Twilight of the Innocents in 2007. After five conventional albums the band released 26 singles in The A-Z Series in 2009, one every two weeks. The band have had one silver, two gold and two platinum-selling (and chart-topping) records in the United Kingdom, as well as 18 songs in the top 40 of the UK Singles Chart. In 2015, they released a sixth studio album, entitled Kablammo!.

	dbo:abstract	"Avantasia is a German supergroup rock opera project created by Tobias Sammet, vocalist of the band Edguy. It has been characterized as a rock opera, as it features the contributions of various vocalists and musicians and it consists of concept albums. The name is a portmanteau of the words \"avalon\" and \"fantasia\" (\"fantasy\") and describes \"a world beyond human imagination\" (a quotation from the booklet). The project can be divided into three periods of activity. The first, 1999\u20132002, saw the release of a self-titled single and the full-length albums The Metal Opera and The Metal Opera Part II. The second, 2006\u20132011, consists of the EPs Lost in Space Part I & II and The Wicked Trilogy, composed of the albums The Scarecrow, The Wicked Symphony and Angel of Babylon. The third period, 2013\u20132016, begins with the album The Mystery of Time and ends with the Ghostlights release. Some of the guest vocalists and musicians that have been featured on Avantasia are: Michael Kiske, J\u00F8rn Lande, Alice Cooper, Klaus Meine, Dee Snider, Jon Oliva, Biff Byford, Joe Lynn Turner, Tim \"Ripper\" Owens, Geoff Tate, Kai Hansen, Rudolf Schenker, Bruce Kulick, Sascha Paeth, Eric Singer, Eric Martin, Bob Catley, Roy Khan, Russell Allen, Marco Hietala, Henjo Richter, Markus Grosskopf, Timo Tolkki, Jens Johansson, Rob Rock, David Defeis, Andre Matos, Sharon den Adel, Arjen Anthony Lucassen, Ronnie Atkins, Oliver Hartmann and Amanda Somerville."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Bad Brains are an American hardcore punk band formed in Washington, D.C., in 1977. They are widely regarded as among the pioneers of hardcore punk, though the band's members have objected to this term to describe their music. They are also an adept reggae band, while later recordings featured elements of other genres like funk, heavy metal, hip hop and soul. Bad Brains are followers of the Rastafari movement. Originally formed as a jazz fusion ensemble under the name Mind Power, Bad Brains developed a very fast and intense punk rock sound which came to be labeled \"hardcore\", and was often played faster and more emphatically than the music of many of their peers. The unique factor of the band's music was the fact that they played more complex rhythms than other hardcore punk bands, also adapting non-punk style guitar riffs and solos into their songs. Bad Brains have released nine studio albums (one of which is entirely composed of instrumental versions of their past material). The band broke up and reformed several times over the years, sometimes with different singers or drummers. Since 1998, the \"classic\" lineup of singer H.R. (Human Rights), guitarist Dr. Know, bassist Darryl Jenifer, and drummer Earl Hudson (H.R.'s younger brother) has reunited, albeit performing sporadically."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Bad Religion is an American punk rock band that formed in Los Angeles, California, in 1979. They make extensive use of three-part vocal harmonies (which they refer to in their album liner notes as the \"oozin' aahs\") and guitar solos, and are known for their lyrics, which cover topics such as criticism of religion, political commentary and social responsibility. The band's lineup has changed several times over its lifespan, with lead vocalist Greg Graffin being the only consistent member; the current lineup, however, features three of the band's four original members (Graffin, Brett Gurewitz and Jay Bentley). To date, Bad Religion has released sixteen studio albums, two live albums, three compilation albums, three EPs (one of which is composed of covers of Christmas songs) and two DVDs (which were both recorded live). They are considered to be one of the best-selling punk rock acts of all time, having sold over five million albums worldwide. Bad Religion had built an underground following in the United States with their early albums (including Suffer, No Control, Against the Grain and Generator) before signing to Atlantic Records in 1993. They rose to fame that same year with their seventh studio album Recipe for Hate, which peaked at number 14 on Billboard's Heatseekers chart. Recipe for Hate was followed a year later by Stranger than Fiction, which spawned their biggest hits \"Infected\" and the re-recorded version of \"21st Century (Digital Boy)\", and was certified gold in both the United States and Canada. Shortly before the release of Stranger than Fiction, Gurewitz left Bad Religion to run his label Epitaph on a full-time basis, and was replaced by Brian Baker. Since the return of Gurewitz in 2001, the band has undergone a resurgence in popularity, with their sixteenth studio album True North (2013) becoming Bad Religion's first album to crack the top 20 on the Billboard 200 chart, where it peaked at number 19. The band is expected to release their seventeenth studio album in 2017."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Badfinger were a British rock band that, in their most successful lineup, consisted of Pete Ham, Mike Gibbins, Tom Evans, and Joey Molland. The band evolved from an earlier group called The Iveys that was formed in 1961 by Ham, Ron Griffiths and David \"Dai\" Jenkins in Swansea, Wales. The Iveys were the first group signed by the Beatles' Apple label in 1968. Over the next five years the band recorded five albums for Apple and toured extensively, before they became embroiled in the chaos of Apple Records' dissolution. In 1969, Griffiths left and was replaced by Molland, and the band renamed themselves Badfinger. In 1970, the band engaged American businessman Stan Polley to manage their commercial affairs. Badfinger had four consecutive worldwide hits from 1970 to 1972: \"Come and Get It\" (written and produced by Paul McCartney), \"No Matter What\", \"Day After Day\" (produced by George Harrison) and \"Baby Blue\". In 2013, \"Baby Blue\" made a resurgence onto the Billboard Hot Rock Songs chart at number 14 after it was featured in the series finale of the television show Breaking Bad. Their song \"Without You\" has been covered many times, including a Billboard number one hit for Harry Nilsson. After Apple Records folded, Badfinger signed to Warner Bros. Records, but Polley's financial machinations resulted in internal friction that soon caused Ham to quit Badfinger, to be replaced by Bob Jackson on keyboard and guitar, then led to Ham rejoining and Molland leaving the band instead. However, a lawsuit filed by Warner's music publishing arm against Polley over missing escrow account money led Warner to withdraw Badfinger's 1974 Wish You Were Here from the market seven weeks after its release, which effectively cut off the band's income. Warner's then refused to accept (or pay the band for) Badfinger's next album, Head First, because of the dispute with Polley, leaving the band destitute. Three days before his 28th birthday, on 24 April 1975, Ham committed suicide by hanging himself, leaving a note that included damning comments about Polley. Over the next three years, the surviving members struggled to rebuild their personal and professional lives against a backdrop of lawsuits, which tied up the songwriters' royalty payments for years. The Badfinger albums Airwaves (1979) and Say No More (1981) (both of which excluded both Gibbins and Jackson) foundered, as Molland and Evans see-sawed between cooperation and conflict in their attempts to revive and capitalise on the Badfinger legacy. Having seen Ham's body after Ham's wife had called him, Evans reportedly never got over his friend's suicide, and was quoted as saying in darker moments, \"I wanna be where he is.\" On 19 November 1983, Evans also took his own life by hanging."@en ;

Formed in 1999, the band blended influences stemming from modern hardcore punk, symphonic black metal, and melodic death metal. Although the band was often labeled as simply metalcore, when Brandan Schieppati was asked if he considered Bleeding Through a hardcore band, he said: \"I think we're a hardcore band and I'll never say we are a metal band, we're all hardcore kids and we came from the hardcore scene. Ours is just a different version of hardcore, we're trying to do something which adds a different variety to the hardcore scene, which has been sounding the same way for so long.\" In 2004, Revolver magazine hailed Bleeding Through as one of eight bands ushering in the \"Future of Metal\" cover story, and Spin called Bleeding Through an \"artist to watch\" in the magazine's February 2004 issue."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Blind Guardian is a German power metal band formed in the mid-1980s in Krefeld, West Germany. They are often credited as one of the seminal and most influential bands in the power metal and speed metal subgenres. Ten musicians have been a part of the band's line-up in its history, which has consisted of singer Hansi K\u00FCrsch, guitarists Andr\u00E9 Olbrich and Marcus Siepen, and drummer Frederik Ehmke since 2005. Blind Guardian is a part of the German heavy metal scene that emerged in the mid-1980s. The band was formed in 1984 as Lucifer's Heritage by K\u00FCrsch (then also bass guitarist), Olbrich, other guitarist Markus D\u00F6rk and drummer Thomas Stauch. D\u00F6rk and Stauch both left the following year, and were replaced by Christof Thei\u00DFen and Hans-Peter Frey respectively, who left as well before the end of the year. In 1987, Siepen joined and Stauch returned; under this line-up, which lasted 18 years (the longest in the band's history), the band changed their name to Blind Guardian and released their first album, Battalions of Fear, in 1988. Over the releases, Blind Guardian established themselves as a notable successful band and as pioneers of the power metal movement. In 1996, K\u00FCrsch stopped acting as the band's bass guitarist to focus on vocals. Various session members replaced him, mainly Oliver Holzwarth. However, in 2005, Stauch left the band, disapproving of Blind Guardian's transition into a more complex progressive sound with a heavy use of backing vocals, and was replaced by Ehmke. Most of Blind Guardian's albums were well received by fans and critics alike: Somewhere Far Beyond (1992), Imaginations from the Other Side (1995), and Nightfall in Middle-Earth (1998), are especially seen as influential works. The music is mostly composed by K\u00FCrsch and Olbrich together, and the lyrics, written by K\u00FCrsch, are mostly inspired by the fiction of fantasy authors such as J. R. R. Tolkien, Michael Moorcock, Robert Jordan, Stephen King and George R. R. Martin as well as traditional legends and epics. Over the years a theme has developed which personifies the band members as travelling storytellers, leading fans to refer to the band affectionately as \"The Bards\"."@en ;

Best remembered for their 1993 single \"No Rain\", the group enjoyed critical and commercial success in the early 1990s with their neo-psychedelic take on alternative rock. After releasing two charting albums on Capitol Records and touring extensively, the band was halted in 1995 by the fatal overdose of lead vocalist Shannon Hoon, going on hiatus until officially disbanding four years later and embarking upon new projects. In 2006, the remaining members reunited and recruited new vocalist Travis Warren from the band Rain Fur Rent, producing a fourth album, For My Friends. Warren departed two years later, but again rejoined in 2010, allowing the group to return to performing and recording."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Blues Traveler is an American rock band, formed in Princeton, New Jersey in 1987. The band's music covers a variety of genres, including blues rock, psychedelic rock, folk rock, soul, and Southern rock. They are known for extensive use of segues in their live performances, and were considered a key part of the re-emerging jam band scene of the 1990s, spearheading the H.O.R.D.E. touring music festival. Currently, the group comprises singer and harmonica player John Popper, guitarist Chan Kinchla, drummer Brendan Hill, bassist Tad Kinchla, and keyboardist Ben Wilson. Tad Kinchla and Ben Wilson joined the band following the death of original bassist Bobby Sheehan in 1999. While Blues Traveler is best known among fans for their improvisational live shows, the general public is most familiar with the group from their Top 40 singles \"Run-Around\" and \"Hook\". They gained mainstream popularity after their fourth studio album four, released in 1994. Sheehan's death and Popper's struggle with obesity put a damper on the group's success, and A&M dropped the band in 2002. However, the band took this transition period as an opportunity to start in new directions musically, going largely independent and releasing on smaller experimental labels. In March 2012, Blues Traveler released a double-disc compilation entitled 25 on Hip-O Records; the album commemorates the band's silver anniversary and includes their hit singles, new covers, and previously unreleased b-side material. Blues Traveler's most recent studio album Blow Up the Moon, is the twelfth studio album and was released on April 7, 2015. As part of the Blow Up the Moon album, Blues Traveler released a music video using Rockstar editor in Grand Theft Auto V on September 14, 2015. The music video\u0081 features JC Chasez and 3OH!3."@en ;

Their controversial self-titled debut album was released on Sire Records in 1992. The song \"Cop Killer\" was the subject of much controversy. Although Sire Records' parent company, Warner Bros. Records, defended the single, Ice-T chose to remove the track from the album because he felt that the controversy had eclipsed the music itself. The group left Sire the following year. Since then, they have released three further albums on different labels, none of which have been received as commercially or critically well as their debut album.

	dbo:abstract	"Booker T. & the M.G.'s is an instrumental R&B/funk band that was influential in shaping the sound of Southern soul and Memphis soul. The original members of the group were Booker T. Jones (organ, piano), Steve Cropper (guitar), Lewie Steinberg (bass), and Al Jackson, Jr. (drums). In the 1960s, as members of the house band of Stax Records, they played on hundreds of recordings by artists such as Wilson Pickett, Otis Redding, Bill Withers, Sam & Dave, Carla Thomas, Rufus Thomas, Johnnie Taylor and Albert King. They also released instrumental records under their own name, of which the best known is the 1962 hit single \"Green Onions\". As originators of the unique Stax sound, the group was one of the most prolific, respected, and imitated of its era. By the mid-1960s, bands on both sides of the Atlantic were trying to sound like Booker T. & the M.G.'s. In 1965, Steinberg was replaced by Donald \"Duck\" Dunn, who played with the group until his death in 2012. Al Jackson, Jr. was murdered in 1975, after which Dunn, Cropper and Jones reunited on numerous occasions using various drummers, including Willie Hall, Anton Fig, Steve Jordan and Steve Potts. The band was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1992, the Musicians Hall of Fame and Museum in Nashville, Tennessee, in 2008, and the Memphis Music Hall of Fame in 2012. Having two white members (Cropper and Dunn), Booker T. & the M.G.'s was one of the first racially integrated rock groups, at a time when soul music and the Memphis music scene in particular were generally considered the preserve of black culture."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Boyz II Men is an American R&B vocal group, best known for emotional ballads and a cappella harmonies. Formerly a quartet including bass Michael McCary, they are currently a trio composed of baritone Nathan Morris alongside tenors Wanya Morris and Shawn Stockman. During the 1990s, Boyz II Men found fame on Motown Records as a quartet. McCary left the group in 2003 due to health issues and contractual agreements. During the 1990s, Boyz II Men gained international success. This began with the release of the number one single \"End of the Road\" in 1992, which reached the top of charts worldwide. \"End of the Road\" would set a new record for longevity, staying at number one on the Billboard Hot 100 for thirteen weeks, breaking the decades-old record held by Elvis Presley. Boyz II Men proceeded to break this record with the subsequent releases of \"I'll Make Love to You\" and \"One Sweet Day\" (with Mariah Carey), which, at fourteen and sixteen weeks respectively, each set new records for the total number of weeks at number one. \"I'll Make Love to You\" also topped the charts in Australia (for four weeks) and garnered international success. As of 2016, \"One Sweet Day\" still holds the all-time record with sixteen weeks at the top of the Hot 100. Consequently, Boyz II Men are top ranking members with regard to time spent at number one in Billboard history, ranking in the fourth spot with 50 weeks (as of 2014). Furthermore, when \"On Bended Knee\" took the number 1 spot away from \"I'll Make Love to You\", Boyz II Men became only the third artists ever (after The Beatles and Presley) to replace themselves at the top of the Billboard Hot 100. Boyz II Men are among a select group of artists that have held at the number-one spot for at least 50 weeks cumulatively, placing them just fourth on that list behind Elvis Presley, The Beatles, and Mariah Carey. These achievements were enough to earn Boyz II Men recognition as Billboard magazine's fourth most successful musical group of the 1990s. Boyz II Men continue to perform worldwide, as a trio. Their most recent studio album, Collide, was released in 2014."@en ;

The original version of the Flecktones consist of B\u00E9la Fleck on acoustic and electric banjo, Victor Wooten on bass guitar, his brother, Roy Wooten (a.k.a. Future Man) on Drumitar, and Howard Levy on harmonica and keyboard. Levy departed in 1992, and the group continued as a trio for several years until sax player Jeff Coffin joined. Coffin departed in 2010 to join the Dave Matthews Band, and Levy rejoined in 2011. The Flecktones have toured extensively since then, often playing over 200 concerts per year.

The group currently features Ginsburg, Margera, and bassist Matt Deis. Originally known by the full name Camp Kill Yourself, and later briefly credited as simply Camp, CKY found initial recognition through its musical contributions to the CKY video series and to the TV series Jackass. The band released its debut studio album Volume 1 in 1999, which was largely made up of material recorded for the CKY films. The group later signed with The Island Def Jam Music Group and released Infiltrate\u2022Destroy\u2022Rebuild in 2002, which gave the band its first US chart success. An Answer Can Be Found followed in 2005. Their most recent album to date, Carver City, was released by Roadrunner Records in 2009. CKY has been categorized as a band of multiple musical genres, including alternative metal, post-grunge and skate punk. The band's songwriting in the past was typically led by Miller, with production, engineering and mixing handled by Ginsburg. In recent years, internal tensions between band members halted progress on new material and touring; Ginsburg, Margera and Deis have since retained the CKY name, while Miller has reformed Foreign Objects and started a new version of the band as 96 Bitter Beings."@en ;

The band's anarchist politics exhibit an irreverent attitude toward authority, and the band has been forthright in its stances on issues including animal rights, pacifism (early in their career) and later regarding class struggle, feminism, gay liberation, pop culture and anti-fascism. The band is best known for its song \"Tubthumping\", which was nominated for Best British Single at the 1998 Brit Awards. Other singles include \"Amnesia\", \"Enough Is Enough\" (with MC Fusion), \"Timebomb\", \"Top of the World (Ole, Ole, Ole)\", and \"Add Me\". In July 2012, Chumbawamba announced its decision to end the band. On its website the members stated \"That\u2019s it then, it\u2019s the end. With neither a whimper, a bang, or a reunion.\"The band performed three last shows between 31 October and 3 November."@en ;

By the mid-1990s, the band's popularity declined severely due to personal setbacks, break-ups, and changes in the music industry. Nonetheless, after a hiatus the band reunited and has continued to tour. Though the band continues to tour, the band has not recorded any studio material since their 1994 album Still Climbing.

	dbo:abstract	"Clannad (Irish pronunciation: [kl\u032A\u02E0an\u032A\u02E0ad\u032A\u02E0]) are an Irish band formed in 1970 in Gweedore, County Donegal. Their music has been variously described as bordering on folk and folk rock, traditional Irish, Celtic and new-age, often incorporating elements of an even broader spectrum of smooth jazz and Gregorian chant. After twelve years of success in the folk music industry, they shot to international recognition in 1982 with the release of the \"Theme from Harry's Game\", becoming the most successful band in the Celtic music genre. They subsequently went on to bridge the gap between traditional Celtic music and pop music in the 1980s and 1990s with albums such as Macalla and Anam. Their records usually consist of traditional Gaelic ballads, new-age tracks that carry the group's trademark of haunting vocal harmonies, mellow harp-based instrumentals and often upbeat pop-flavoured numbers. During their career they toured the world extensively and gained fans in every major territory. They have recorded in six different languages, most notably in Irish, and their record sales have exceeded the 15 million mark. They are also widely regarded as the band which, for the first time, put Irish traditional music and the Irish language on the world stage and paved the way for many other Irish artists. They have won several notable awards throughout their career, including a Grammy, a BAFTA, an Ivor Novello and a Billboard Music Award. Clannad are a family band composed of siblings Moya Brennan, Ciar\u00E1n Brennan, P\u00F3l Brennan, who left in 1990 and rejoined in 2011) and their twin uncles Noel Duggan and P\u00E1draig Duggan (died 9 August 2016). Their sister/niece Enya (Irish: Eithne N\u00ED Bhraon\u00E1in) left the group in 1981 to pursue a solo career. Ten years after \"taking a break\", the five original members of Clannad reunited on stage at the Celtic Connections Festival in February 2007 in Glasgow, Scotland. Moya, Ciar\u00E1n, Noel and P\u00E1draig embarked on their first UK tour in over 10 years in March 2008, starting in Gateshead. In September 2013, Clannad released N\u00E1d\u00FAr, their first studio album in fifteen years."@en ;

Their most recent release, The Color Before the Sun, is the band's first non-conceptual album since their inception. It reached #10 on the Billboard 200.

The band's musical style evolved from black metal to a cleaner and more \"produced\" amalgam of gothic metal, symphonic metal and other metal genres. Their lyrical themes and imagery are heavily influenced by gothic literature, poetry, mythology and horror films. The band has broken free from its original niche by courting mainstream publicity (often to the chagrin of its early fanbase), giving the band a \"commercial\" image. This increased accessibility has brought coverage from the likes of Kerrang! and MTV, along with frequent main stage appearances at major festivals such as Ozzfest, Download and even the mainstream Sziget Festival. They have sometimes been perceived as satanic by casual observers, even though their outright lyrical references to Satanism are few and far between; their use of satanic imagery has arguably always been more for shock value rather than any seriously held beliefs."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Dave Matthews Band (often abbreviated to DMB) is an American rock band that was formed in Charlottesville, Virginia in 1991. The founding members were singer-songwriter and guitarist Dave Matthews, bassist Stefan Lessard, drummer/backing vocalist Carter Beauford and saxophonist LeRoi Moore. Boyd Tinsley was added to the band as a violinist soon after the band was formed. Moore died suddenly in August 2008 due to complications from injuries sustained in an ATV accident. Grammy Award-winner Jeff Coffin (of B\u00E9la Fleck and the Flecktones) has since filled Moore's spot as the band's saxophonist. Rashawn Ross and Tim Reynolds have also become full-time touring members of the band. The band's 2009 album Big Whiskey & the GrooGrux King (the first album since Moore's death) debuted at number one on the Billboard 200, earning the band their fifth consecutive number-one debut. Their most recent album, Away from the World, released September 29, 2012, debuted at number one on the Billboard chart \u2014 making them the only group to have six consecutive studio albums debut in the top spot. As of 2010, the Dave Matthews Band sold over 30 million records worldwide. The band is known for their annual summer-long tours of the United States and Europe, featuring lengthy improvisational renditions of their songs, accompanied by an elaborate video and lighting show. The band is known for playing the songs differently each time. This portion of the tour has become a stamp of DMB and has grown with the band since Fenton Williams began working with them in the early 1990s."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Deftones is an American alternative metal band from Sacramento, California. Formed in 1988, the band was founded by Chino Moreno (lead vocals, rhythm guitar), Stephen Carpenter (lead guitar), Abe Cunningham (drums and percussion) and Dominic Garcia (bass). During the group's first five years, the band's lineup changed several times, but stabilized in 1993 when Cunningham rejoined the group after his departure in 1990. Cunningham replaced John Taylor, who had replaced Garcia after he had switched to drums in 1990, and the bassist role had been filled by Chi Cheng. The lineup remained stable for fifteen years, with the exception of keyboardist and turntablist Frank Delgado being added in 1999. In 2008, Cheng was involved in an automobile accident that ended his stint with Deftones and eventually took his life in 2013. He has been replaced by Sergio Vega. The band is known as one of the most experimental groups to have come from the alternative metal music scene. Deftones have released eight albums since their inception. After the lineup settled in 1993, the band secured a recording contract with Maverick Records, and subsequently released their debut album, Adrenaline, in 1995. Promoting the album by touring exhaustively with other bands in the scene, Deftones managed to gain a dedicated fan base through word of mouth. Their sophomore album, Around the Fur, was released in 1997. The album and its singles reached chart positions, and the album was the band's first to receive certification from the RIAA. The band found even further success with their third album, White Pony, in 2000. It showed a transition away from the band's earlier sound into a more experimental direction. Its lead single, \"Change (In the House of Flies)\", is the group's most commercially successful single, and the album track \"Elite\" won a Grammy Award for Best Metal Performance. White Pony was the band's first album to be certified platinum in the United States. Their self-titled fourth album was released in 2003. While the group's mainstream success continued, sales proved to be lackluster compared to White Pony. The follow-up, Saturday Night Wrist, was released in 2006 after a temporary falling out within the band due to creative tensions. Its completion was also delayed by personal issues within the band, some of which influenced its material. In 2008, while Deftones were working on an album tentatively titled Eros, Cheng was involved in a traffic collision. As a result, he was left in a minimally conscious state until his death in 2013 of cardiac arrest. During that time, Deftones halted production on Eros and released Diamond Eyes and Koi No Yokan in 2010 and 2012 respectively, with current bassist Vega. In 2016, the band released a followup, titled Gore."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Duran Duran are an English new wave/synthpop band formed in Birmingham in 1978. The most successful period for the band spanned from the early 1980s to the mid-1990s. The group were a leading band in the MTV-driven \"Second British Invasion\" of the US. They have placed 14 singles in the Top 10 of the UK Singles Chart and 21 in the Billboard Hot 100, and have sold over 70 million records. When they first emerged, they were generally considered part of the New Romantic scene, along with bands such as Spandau Ballet. Soon they would shed this image, using fashion and marketing to build a more refined and elegant presentation. The band has won a number of awards throughout their career: two Brit Awards including the 2004 award for Outstanding Contribution to Music, two Grammy Awards, and an MTV Video Music Award for Lifetime Achievement. They were also awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. The video age catapulted Duran Duran into the mainstream with the introduction of the 24-hour music channel MTV. Many of their videos were shot on 35 mm film, which gave a much more polished look than was standard at the time. They also collaborated with professional film directors to take the quality a step further, often teaming up with Australian Russell Mulcahy for some of their most memorable video offerings. In 1984, the band were early innovators with video technology in their live stadium shows. The group was formed by keyboardist Nick Rhodes and bassist John Taylor, with the later addition of drummer Roger Taylor, and after numerous personnel changes, guitarist Andy Taylor and lead singer Simon Le Bon. These five members featured in their most commercially successful line-up. The group has never disbanded, but after separation of Andy Taylor in 1986, the line-up has changed to include former Missing Persons American guitarist Warren Cuccurullo from 1989 to 2001 and American drummer Sterling Campbell from 1989 to 1991. The reunion of the original five members in the early 2000s created a stir among the band's fans and music media. Andy Taylor left the band once again in mid-2006, and guitarist Dom Brown has since been working with the band as a session player and touring member."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Earth, Wind & Fire (EWF) is an American band that has spanned the musical genres of R&B, soul, funk, jazz, disco, pop, rock, Latin and African. They are one of the most successful bands of all time. Rolling Stone Magazine described them as \"innovative, precise yet sensual, calculated yet galvanizing\" and declared that the band \"changed the sound of black pop\". The band was founded in Chicago by Maurice White in 1971, having grown out of a previous band known as The Salty Peppers. Other members have included Philip Bailey, Verdine White, Ralph Johnson, Larry Dunn, Al McKay and Andrew Woolfolk. The band has received 20 Grammy nominations; they won six as a group and two of its members, Maurice White and Bailey, won separate individual awards. Earth, Wind & Fire have 12 American Music Awards nominations and four awards. They have been inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and the Vocal Group Hall of Fame, received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, and sold over 100 million records, making them one of the world's best-selling bands of all time. Five members of Earth, Wind & Fire were also inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame: Maurice White, Philip Bailey, Verdine White, Larry Dunn and Al McKay. The music industry and fans have bestowed Lifetime Achievement honors from the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers (Rhythm & Soul Heritage Award \u2013 2002), NAACP (Hall of Fame \u2013 1994) and the BET Awards (Lifetime Achievement Award \u2013 2002). Earth, Wind & Fire is known for the dynamic sound of their horn section, their energetic and elaborate stage shows, and the interplay between the contrasting vocals of Philip Bailey's falsetto and Maurice White's tenor. The kalimba (African thumb piano) is played on all of the band's albums. In the 1970s and early 1980s, the band had many hits, including \"Shining Star\", \"That's the Way of the World\", \"Devotion\", \"Reasons\", \"Sing a Song\", \"Can't Hide Love\", \"Getaway\", \"Fantasy\", \"Love's Holiday\", \"September\", \"Boogie Wonderland\", \"After the Love Has Gone\", and \"Let's Groove\". Two Earth, Wind & Fire classic songs have been inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame: \"That\u2019s the Way of the World\" (2004) and \"Shining Star\" (2007). The band is also known as having been the first African-American act to sell out Madison Square Garden and to receive the MSG Gold Ticket Award. President Barack Obama invited Earth, Wind & Fire to perform at the White House for the first social event of the new administration."@en ;
