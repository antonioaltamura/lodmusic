	dbo:abstract	"\"Ai no Uta\" (\u611B\u306E\u3046\u305F Song of Love) is an image song released in conjunction with the video game Pikmin for the Nintendo GameCube. The song was only used in commercials for the game and does not appear in the game itself, and those commercials appeared only in Japan. A small clip of the song though can be heard being sung by the Pikmin in Pikmin 2, and the song is one of the default tracks available for the Distant Planet stage in Super Smash Bros. Brawl (along with a new, French language version). The song is sung by the virtual group Strawberry Flower, who also sang the theme song for Pikmin 2. The title of the song translates to \"Song of Love,\" so named because the song expounds on the emotions the Pikmin feel in relation to their involvement in the game. The Pikmin are depicted to feel a kind of sadness, but also devotion to their given task of helping the game's protagonist, Captain Olimar. The song was featured in commercials for the Pikmin video game, in order to stimulate flagging sales. The song became immediately very popular and soon became one of the most recognizable songs in Japan at the time. Many people had memorized the song from the commercials, and soon after the sales of the video game rose nearly fivefold. The song itself was released as a CD Single on December 6, 2001 and remained in the top ten for several weeks. Unexpectedly, the song actually outsold the game it has advertised, even beating Pikmin's sales figures shortly after its release as a single. The song was a remarkable media phenomenon in that it sold equally well to audiences of all ages and tastes. The single has sold over 632,350 copies and was ranked 8th in 2002 Oricon Yearly Chart. The single is rare and out of print."@en ;

It was written by Tim Berg, Simon Jeffes, Arash Pournouri, Autumn Rowe, Sandy Wilhelm, with production helmed by Wilhelm under his production name Sandy Vee and The Young Boys. \"Collide\" is a house inspired love song, that's instrumentation consists of piano riffs and a guitar. The song was recorded for Lewis' third studio album Glassheart, but was not included on the album's final track listing. Upon the release of the single, Avicii claimed that Lewis and her record label, Syco, had sampled his song \"Penguin\" without his authorisation, and accused them of plagiarism. Before the lawsuit was filed by Avicii and his record label reach the high court, Syco announced that the song would be a joint release between Lewis and Avicii. The song premiered in the United Kingdom on 15 July 2011 and was sent to Australian radio on 22 August 2011. \"Collide\" was released digitally via the iTunes Store on 2 September, as part of a collection of the original song, as well as remixes by Afrojack, Cahill, Alex Gaudino and Jason Rooney. The Afrojack remix is included as a bonus track on the deluxe edition of Glassheart. \"Collide\" received a mixed reaction from music critics. Some were complimentary of Lewis's vocal performance and compared it to Katy Perry's song \"Firework\", whilst others were critical of its musical structure. The song achieved commercial success, and peaked inside the top five of the singles charts in Ireland, Scotland and the United Kingdom. It also peaked at number one on the US Hot Dance Club Songs chart. As part of promotion for the song, an accompanying music video was shot on a beach in Malibu, California and directed by Ethan Ladder. Lewis also performed the song on the game show Red or Black? and at London nightclub G-A-Y, along with other songs. At the 2012 Grammy Awards, the Afrojack remix was nominated for Best Remixed Recording."@en ;

Singer Milo Aukerman later remarked that the concept was Robinson's: \"He kinda took the idea of 'I'm the One' to mean 'I'm gonna be your sperm, baby.' When he told me the idea I thought, 'Oh no, shades of Woody Allen!', but when I got on that skateboard in that sperm costume, I don't know, things just started to work for me.

The song received generally positive reviews from music critics, who highlighted its production and the saxophone line.

	dbo:abstract	"\"Indestructible\" is a song by Swedish recording artist Robyn, taken from her seventh studio album Body Talk (2010). The song was written by Robyn and Klas \u00C5hlund, and produced by \u00C5hlund. It was released as the lead single from Body Talk on 1 November 2010 in Sweden and one day later in the United States. The song was previously heard, in an acoustic form, as the final track on Body Talk Pt. 2, released in September 2010. The song was one of the first to be recorded for the Body Talk series, but Robyn saved it for later to give it a chance of becoming a single. According to Robyn, \"Indestructible\" describes how meeting new people and falling in love can be scary and fun at the same time. The song is a synthpop ballad with string sounds, pulsing bass and an electronic arrangement. The song was met with generally positive reviews from critics, who praised its production and Robyn's songwriting. It reached number four on the Sverigetopplistan chart, becoming Robyn's ninth top ten hit in her native country. It charted moderately elsewhere, reaching number thirteen in Denmark and number twenty-one on the UK Dance Chart. The accompanying music video was directed by Max Vitali and Nils Ljunggren. It shows scenes of couples having sex, and cutscenes of Robyn wearing a special designed dress featuring tubes with colored liquid. Robyn wanted to make the video to show the truth about sex. The dress was designed by Lucy McRae, who specializes in \"body architecture\". An advanced machine was built to control the flow of the liquid and a kilometre of tubes were used. The video received positive reviews from critics, who called it honest and intriguing. Robyn performed the song at the 2010 Nobel Peace Prize Concert."@en ;

It was released as a single in 1978, sold over a million copies, and reached number 17 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. Martin previewed the song in a live performance during the April 22, 1978 episode of Saturday Night Live. The song was also included on Martin's album A Wild and Crazy Guy. \"King Tut\" paid homage to Egyptian pharaoh Tutankhamun and presents a caricature of the sensational Treasures of Tutankhamun traveling exhibit that toured seven United States cities from 1976 to 1979. The exhibit attracted approximately eight million visitors. In the Saturday Night Live performance of \"King Tut,\" loyal subjects appease a joyful King Tut with kitchen appliances. An instrumental solo is delivered by saxophone player Lou Marini, who steps out of a sarcophagus\u2014painted gold\u2014to great laughter. In the book Saturday Night: A Backstage History of Saturday Night Live, authors Doug Hill and Jeff Weingrad write that the sketch was one of the most expensive productions the show had attempted up to that point. Martin had brought the song to the show and asked if he could perform it, not expecting the production that occurred\u2014producer Lorne Michaels put everything behind it. Martin and the Steep Canyon Rangers recorded the song in a bluegrass version for their 2011 album, Rare Bird Alert. The song is the subject of in-depth analysis in Melani McAlister's Epic Encounters: Culture, Media, and U.S. Interests in the Middle East, 1945\u20132000. It is also referenced in a dialogue in the video game The Lost Vikings (1992) at the end of one of the Egyptian themed levels of the game. Chicago radio superstation WLS-AM, which gave the song much airplay, ranked \"King Tut\" as the 11th biggest hit of 1978.

It is the fourth track on his 1966 album Blonde on Blonde, and was released as the album's first single that February. The song is an emotional confession of misconnects and apologies from the singer to a woman who has tragically slipped out of his life. As a single, it peaked at #33 in the UK but only reached #119 on Billboard's Bubbling Under charts. According to Jonathan Singer, it was Paul Griffin who played the piano part on \"One of Us Must Know (Sooner or Later)\". A particularly noteworthy and unusual Phil Spector styled cover of this song was released by Les Fradkin on his \"If Your Memory Serves You Well\" CD in 2006. English singer-songwriter Mick Hucknall covered the song on the 2012 charity compilation album Chimes of Freedom: The Songs of Bob Dylan Honoring 50 Years of Amnesty International. Musically, the track is typical of the album a treble single coil guitar adds a base to the song with the acoustic and bass while organs and pianos take the lead in forming the song.

An accompanying music video for \"Ray of Light\" was directed by Jonas \u00C5kerlund and shows scenes from different cities around the world, with Madonna singing the song in front of them. The video was critically acclaimed, receiving the Grammy Award for Best Short Form Music Video, as well as winning five awards at the 1998 MTV Video Music Awards. Later, Stefano Salvati accused her of plagiarizing the concept of a music video he directed for Biagio Antonacci in 1994. The song has been performed in three of Madonna's concert tours, most recently on her Sticky & Sweet Tour (2008\u201309). It has been covered by a number of artists, and has been featured in several elements of popular culture, such as on the FOX show Glee, as well as different advertising campaigns."@en ;

It became Ti\u00EBsto's first number-one hit in Scotland, his first top ten hit in the United Kingdom and his highest charting single in Ireland and Australia. Additionally, \"Red Lights\" also became Ti\u00EBsto's second highest charting single in the United States, where it has peaked at number fifty-six on the US Billboard Hot 100.

Zero hour: 9 a.m. And I'm gonna be high as a kite by then.\" The song first appeared on John's 1972 album Honky Ch\u00E2teau (under the title \"Rocket Man (I Think It's Going to Be a Long, Long Time)\") and became a hit single, rising to #2 in the UK and #6 in the U.S."@en ;

The song was co-written by Khan (For her then husband, Richard Holland) and Rufus band mate Tony Maiden and became one of the band and Khan's signature songs. Eighteen years later, in 1993, the song was covered by R&B singer Mary J. Blige who had a version that was a top forty hit on both sides for a second time with it reaching number twenty-eight pop and number-eleven R&B. In 1997, contemporary jazz saxophonist Boney James did a cover of the song, included on the album titled Sweet Thing. The album's title track included background vocals by original co-writer Tony Maiden. Khan recorded it again for the New York Undercover: a Night at Natalies soundtrack, released in 1998. Initially, Khan disliked Blige covering it[citation needed] but eventually Khan befriended Blige and the two singers later sang the song together during a VH-1 Divas Live concert in 2003. Khan and Blige have since recorded the duet \"Disrespectful\", for Khan's recent release, Funk This. UK soul singer Beverley Knight has also recorded a version of the song. Knight's version was recorded for a BBC Radio 2 session and was included as the B-side to her single \"Not Too Late For Love\". Due to the popularity of Knight's version with her fans, it was later included on her Voice - The Best of Beverley Knight compilation. Knight has since been invited to perform the song at Khan's London O2 Arena date[when?] on her UK tour, after collaborating with the singer on her Blige duet \"Disrepectul\" at the Montreaux Jazz Festival."@en ;

dbr:Take_Five	rdf:type	dbo:MusicalWork ;
	dbo:abstract	"\"Take Five\" is a jazz piece composed by Paul Desmond and performed by The Dave Brubeck Quartet on their 1959 album Time Out. Recorded at Columbia Records' 30th Street Studio in New York City on July 1, 1959, fully two years later it became an unlikely hit and the biggest-selling jazz single ever. Included in numerous movie and television soundtracks, it still receives significant radio play. \"Take Five\" was for several years during the early 1960s the theme music for the NBC Today program, the opening bars being played half a dozen times or more each day. Written in the key of E-flat minor, it is known for its distinctive two-chord piano vamp; catchy blues-scale saxophone melody; inventive, jolting drum solo; and use of the unusual quintuple (54) time, from which its name is derived. Brubeck drew inspiration for this style of music during a U.S. State Department-sponsored tour of Eurasia, where he observed a group of Turkish street musicians performing a traditional folk song with supposedly Bulgarian influences that was played in 98 time (traditionally called \"Bulgarian meter\"), rarely used in Western music. After learning from native symphony musicians about the form, Brubeck was inspired to create an album that deviated from the usual 44 time of jazz and experimented with the exotic styles he had experienced abroad. Released as a single initially on September 21, 1959, the chart potential of \"Take Five\" was fulfilled only after its re-release in May 1961, reaching #25 on the Billboard Hot 100 on October 9 that year and #5 on Billboard's Easy Listening chart three weeks later. The single is a different recording than the LP version and omits most of the drum solo. The piece was also chosen to promote Columbia's ill-fated attempt to introduce 7\" 33 1/3 RPM stereo singles into the marketplace, in 1959. Along with a unique stereo edit of \"Blue Rondo \u00E0 la Turk\", it was pressed in very small numbers as part of a promotional set of records sent to DJs in late 1959. \"Take Five\" was first played by The Dave Brubeck Quartet to a live audience at the Village Gate nightclub in New York City in 1959[exact date?]. Over the next 50 years it was re-recorded many times, and was often used by the group to close concerts: each member would in turn, upon completing his solo, stop playing and leave the stage \u00E0 la Haydn's Farewell Symphony until only the drummer remained (as \"Take Five\" had been written to feature Joe Morello's mastery of 54 time). Some of the many cover versions feature lyrics co-written by Dave Brubeck and his wife Iola, including a 1961 live recording sung by Carmen McRae backed by the Quartet. Al Jarreau performed an unusual scat version of the song in Germany in 1976. Desmond, upon his death in 1977, left the rights to royalties for performances of his compositions, including \"Take Five\", to the American Red Cross, which has since received combined royalties of approximately $100,000 per year."@en ;

The song was written by composer David Arnold (who also scored the film) and lyricist Don Black, previously responsible for four other Bond songs, and was produced by Garbage and Arnold. \"The World Is Not Enough\" was composed in the style of the series' title songs, in contrast with the post-modern production and genre-hopping of Garbage's first two albums. The group recorded most of \"The World Is Not Enough\" while touring Europe in support of their album Version 2.0, telephoning Arnold as he recorded the orchestral backing in London before travelling to England. Garbage later finished recording and mixing the song at Armoury Studios in Canada. The lyrics reflect the film's plot (told from the viewpoint of antagonist Elektra King), with themes of world domination and seduction. The song and its accompanying soundtrack were released internationally by Radioactive Records when the film premiered worldwide at the end of November 1999. \"The World Is Not Enough\" was praised by reviewers; it reached the top forty of ten singles charts and the top ten of four.

Springsteen subsequently did, played it for Rourke and director Darren Aronofsky before a concert. When they liked it, Springsteen gave them the song for no fee.

It was released as the group's second single in October 1983 on the independent record label Rough Trade. The song is defined by Marr's jangle pop guitar riff and Morrissey's characteristically morose lyrics, which revolve around the recurrent Smiths themes of sexual ambiguity and lust. Feeling detached from and unable to relate to the early 1980s mainstream gay culture, Morrissey wrote \"This Charming Man\" to evoke an older, more coded and self-aware underground scene. The singer explained of the song's lyrics, \"I really like the idea of the male voice being quite vulnerable, of it being taken and slightly manipulated, rather than there being always this heavy machismo thing that just bores everybody.\" Although only moderately successful on first release\u2014the single peaked at number 25 on the British singles chart, \"This Charming Man\" has been widely praised in both the music and mainstream press. The single was re-issued in 1992, reaching number 8 on the UK singles chart (making it The Smiths' biggest UK hit by chart position). In 2004, BBC Radio 2 listeners voted it number 97 on the station's \"Sold on Song Top 100\" poll.

It won the Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song alongside the Carly Simon song \"Let the River Run\" from Working Girl (with the latter having beaten the former for the Academy Award for Best Original Song) and the Grammy Award for Best Song Written Specifically for a Motion Picture or Television in 1989. Two music videos were made, both directed by Jim Yukich: the first one similar to Collins' 1982 video \"You Can't Hurry Love\" featuring Collins as all four members in a band, and the other featuring him in a wrestling match against the Ultimate Warrior, which was featured on the Jim Yukich-directed Seriously.. Phil Collins CBS TV special (aired September 8, 1990). The special can be found on the 2004 First Final Farewell Tour DVD. The song topped the U.S. Hot 100 for two weeks, the U.S. adult contemporary chart for five weeks, and also reached No. 6 on the UK Singles Chart. It opened the radio station BBC Hereford and Worcester, appropriate in that the station was based in two different places. The B-side features Anne Dudley and the London Film Orchestra performing \"The Robbery\", also on the Buster soundtrack."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"Unconditionally\" is a song by American singer Katy Perry. It was released as the second single from her fourth studio album Prism (2013) on October 16, 2013. Inspiration for the song came primarily from a humanitarian trip to Madagascar that Perry made in partnership with UNICEF. Having been surrounded by what she described as unconditional love, she co-wrote it with the song's producers Dr. Luke, Max Martin and Cirkut to reflect that feeling. \"Unconditionally\" is a power ballad styled in rock, backed against a bassline and percussion. Music critics were divided in their reviews of the song, who highlighted Perry's vocal delivery; others, however, were not as flattering of the track. It peaked at number 14 on the US Billboard Hot 100 and number 25 on the UK Singles Chart, and while it failed to replicate the commercial success of predecessor \"Roar\", the song still reached the top ten in 13 countries. The single release was promoted with an Instagram-based campaign, a lyric video directed by Aya Tanimura and live performances\u2014one of the latter, at the American Music Awards of 2013, was the center of controversy due to accusations of cultural appropriation and racism. Brent Benacorso served as the director for the track's music video, which adopts the theme of love and uses a series of metaphors to enrich its concept."@en ;

It was written and produced by Alex da Kid, with additional writing from Mike Del Rio, Jayson DeZuzio, Steven Battey, Carlos Battey, and Cole. Lyrically, it speaks of a male telling a female anything she wants to hear to get his way. \"Under the Sun\" is a mid-tempo song, piano riffs, sun-kissed breakbeats, and a pop chorus. The song received a positive reaction from most music critics, with most of them, calling it a summery, carefree and enjoyable song. Some critics cited the Chemical Brothers, Natasha Bedingfield, and Lily Allen as references. \"Under the Sun\" fared commercially well where it debuted on the UK Singles Chart at number 57, climbing to number 13. \"Under the Sun\", is Cole's second single to date that has not entered the top five. \"Under the Sun\" also peaked at number 16 in Ireland. The accompanying music video sees Cole travel back to the 1950s to perform the track while strutting down the street. Further scenes see the singer draped on the bonnet of a classic car and performing a choreographed dance sequence with a handful of businessmen. \"Under the Sun\" was promoted with live performances in the United Kingdom, including a T4 special and The Jonathan Ross Show."@en ;

The lyrics were written by comedian Keith Allen. It was released as a single in 1998 and recorded for the 1998 FIFA World Cup. The song was originally written as a parody of football chants, but was adopted as one in its own right and became a cult classic. Much of the song consists of the phrase \"nah nah nah\" and the word \"vindaloo\" repeated over and over by a mixed group, occasionally interspersed with lines such as \"And we all like vindaloo\" and \"We're England; we're gonna score one more than you\". The song has brief verses, spoken/sung by Keith Allen (in a voice sounding remarkably similar to that of the late Ian Dury) over a marching snare drum beat. The song's name comes from the vindaloo, a type of very spicy Goan curry. It is often eaten by football supporters in the United Kingdom (and other nations) accompanied by large quantities of lager, after matches or as part of a \"lads' night out\". \"Vindaloo\" reached number two on the UK Singles Chart in June 1998; it was beaten by \"3 Lions '98\" by David Baddiel and Frank Skinner and Lightning Seeds, a re-release of football anthem \"Three Lions\" from 1996 with slightly altered lyrics.

	dbo:abstract	"\"Wings\" is a song by Australian singer-songwriter Delta Goodrem, released as the lead single from her upcoming fifth studio album. It was written by Goodrem with Anthony Egizii and David Musumeci, the song's producers known as DNA Songs. Sony Music released it as a digital download and CD single on 24 July 2015. \"Wings\" is a pop song, with heavy drums, keyboards, piano, guitar riff and strings as its mains instrumentation. Lyrically, \"Wings\" has a focus on self-empowerment, where Goodrem uses \"the extended metaphor of flight to explore feelings of catharsis and one\u2019s ability to overcome adversity\". Inspired by listening to Calvin Harris and Haim, Ella Henderson, and London Grammar after a creative block, the song received positive reviews from music critics, who commended its empowering atmosphere, the pre-chorus and the song's production. \"Wings\" debuted at number eight on the Australian ARIA Singles Chart, peaking at number one in its third week on the chart, becoming her ninth number-one in the country and her first in eight years. Its music video premiered on 6 August 2015, and it features the singer with spinning pianos, dove flying, ballet jumping and heavy duty wind machines."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"Wings\" is a song by British girl group Little Mix. It was co-written by the group in collaboration with Iain James, Erika Nuri, Michelle Lewis, Mischke, Heidi Rojas and the song's producers, TMS. It was released as their second single after winning the eighth series of The X Factor in 2011, and the lead single from their debut studio album DNA (2012). Syco Music serviced the single to BBC Radio 1 in the United Kingdom on 2 July 2012 and it was released for digital download on 24 August 2012. The uptempo song, which features modern beats, drums, horns and clapping, is a pop arrangement with elements of R&B and old school. Lyrically, the song has themes of girl power, maternal advice and individuality. \"Wings\" was well received by contemporary music critics, who praised its lyrical message, upbeat sound and vocals. \"Wings\" was the group's most successful single to date, until they released Black Magic in 2015. It topped the UK Singles Chart with sales of 107,000 copies in its first week. The single also reached number one in Ireland and Scotland and number three in Australia, where it was certified triple platinum. It charted in the top 40 in three other countries, peaking at number 79 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart and number 26 on the US Billboard Pop Songs chart. The accompanying music video was directed by Max and Dania at an abandoned warehouse. The clip shows the group dancing and singing in front of colourful backdrops and a pink Union Jack flag, wearing urban-styled outfits corresponding to the backdrops. The video received favorable reviews from critics, who praised the group's fashion sense, dancing and confidence.

	dbo:abstract	"\"You Don't Have to Worry\" is a song by American R&B recording artist Mary J. Blige. The song was written for her by Kenny Greene, Edward Ferrell, Darrin Whittington and Kevin Kornegay, and is produced by former Bad Boy rapper Craig Mack for the soundtrack of the film Who's the Man? (1993). The song contains an uncredited portion of the 1988 hip-hop cut, \"The Vapors\" as performed by American beat-boxer/rapper Biz Markie, which in turn samples the 1974 number-one R&B hit, \"Papa Don't Take No Mess\", as performed by James Brown. The original version appears on the film's soundtrack. This version performed modestly on the US Billboard Hot 100, peaking at number sixty-three, and reaching number eleven on the R&B singles chart. It is one out of two singles to be released on the soundtrack (the other being \"Party and Bullshit\" by The Notorious B.I.G.). The official remix version (entitled as \"You Don't Have to Worry (Remix Main with Rap)\") appears on Blige's remix album, What's the 411? Remix, whereas the remix version contains a portion of Lou Donaldson's \"Ode to Billie Joe\". This version is produced by Sean \"Puffy\" Combs and Tony Dofat. The music video, which was directed by F. Gary Gray was filmed at various locations in New York City in the summer of 1993, with Mary performing in a jersey with a New York Yankees cap and baggy jeans, and scenes features Mary wearing an all denim suit with matching boots performing on top of a car in front of a large crowd, as well her wearing an orange jacket. The song's original version which appears in the video, has a slightly alternate difference towards the one on the soundtrack, Blige's vocals throughout the song is multitracked, and the backing vocals are omitted. However, on the soundtrack, her vocals are not multitracked and the chorus/hook is featured throughout. In 2005, the song was later interpolated on Blige's song, \"MJB da MVP\" from her hugely successful seventh album The Breakthrough."@en ;

dbr:Your_Heart_Belongs_to_Me	rdf:type	dbo:MusicalWork ;
	dbo:abstract	"\"Your Heart Belongs to Me\" is a 1962 song written and composed by The Miracles' William \"Smokey\" Robinson and released as a single by Motown singing group The Supremes during their early years with the label. The song is about a woman whose lover is in the armed forces and has \"Gone to a far-away land\"; its narration has her tell him to always remember their love for each other if he ever gets lonely. Recorded at a time when Mary Wells and The Marvelettes were the dominant female recording acts of the label, the Supremes had struggled to release singles with Supremes members Florence Ballard, Diana Ross and Mary Wilson switching lead vocal spots. After the failure of their first single, \"I Want a Guy\" with Ross in the lead, their second single, the Ballard-led \"Buttered Popcorn\", also failed to chart. Wilson's leads, meanwhile, had not been released on any Motown singles. For this record, Smokey Robinson decided to use Ross for lead vocals for the song. It would prove to be a modest success as the song became the Supremes' first nationally charted hit at number 95 on the Billboard Hot 100 but failed to chart on the Hot R&B Sides chart. This became the last single that The Supremes made as a quartet. After this record, fourth member Barbara Martin left the group to start a family leaving Ross, Ballard and Wilson as a trio from then on. Martin is not pictured on the cover both due to her pending departure and because she was noticeably pregnant at the time of the photo shoot. Inspired by its modest charting, Berry Gordy would eventually make Ross the sole lead vocalist for the group. It wouldn't be until 1976 with the release of \"I'm Gonna Let My Heart Do the Walking\" that a Supremes single would feature four Supremes."@en ;

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ghosttown_(Madonna_song)>	rdf:type	dbo:MusicalWork ;
	dbo:abstract	"\"Ghosttown\" is a song recorded by American singer Madonna for her thirteenth studio album, Rebel Heart (2015). It was released to radio stations on March 13, 2015, as the album's second single. The song was written by Madonna, Jason Evigan, Evan Bogart, and Sean Douglas, and produced by Madonna, Billboard and Evigan. Madonna had listened to Douglas's previous works and had requested studio time with him. Together with the other songwriters, they wrote \"Ghosttown\" in three days. A pop ballad, the song was inspired by the imagery of a destructed city after armageddon, and how the survivors carry on with their lives, with love being the only thing they can hold onto. Composed as an uplifting track, \"Ghosttown\" features instrumentation from organ and drums, with minor vocoder effects on Madonna's vocals. \"Ghosttown\" was released to iTunes Store as part of the album's pre-order in December 2014, in response to hackers leaking songs from Rebel Heart. The song received positive response from critics, who commended Madonna's vocal delivery, the lyrics, Billboard's production work, as well as compared it to the singer's early ballads. In the United States, the song became Madonna's 36th entry on the Adult Contemporary chart, as well as her 45th number-one song on the Hot Dance Club Songs chart, surpassing country singer George Strait as the artist with most number-one songs on an active Billboard chart. Internationally, \"Ghosttown\" reached the top twenty position in Hungary and Italy, and the digital charts of Finland and Sweden, and was certified platinum by the Federazione Industria Musicale Italiana (FIMI). Madonna performed the song during her promotional schedules across Europe\u2014Le Grand Journal in France, Che tempo che fa in Italy and The Jonathan Ross Show in the United Kingdom. She also performed it at the 2nd iHeartRadio Music Awards, where she was joined by singer Taylor Swift who played guitar. An accompanying music video for \"Ghosttown\" was directed by Jonas \u00C5kerlund, and starred actor Terrence Howard. The main theme behind the video was \"an apocalyptic situation mimicking the end of the world\", showing the singer and Howard as sole survivors in a destroyed city."@en ;

Written and sung by Nesmith, the song's title is never heard. It is about a man waiting for the arrival of a plane with his girlfriend on it.[citation needed] According to \"Monkee Tales\" #31 (1981), page 7, in the article entitled \"Review of Present\", author John Conners states that the song has a surprise ending. The last line, \"I told you I'd come back, here I am\" is sung by Nesmith in a menacing tone. This gives the tune a sadistic touch; the man is waiting to harm his girlfriend. Nesmith confirms this in the article. \"Good Clean Fun\" reached No. 82 on the Billboard Hot 100 and No. 29 on the Easy Listening chart. The flip-side, \"Mommy and Daddy\", is sung by Micky Dolenz, who wrote it."@en ;

Written by Ester Dean, Frank Romano, Daniel Morris and co-written and produced by Jim Jonsin, the Island-flavored midtempo pop song sees Scherzinger singing about her lover and telling other women to stay away. \"Right There\" first impacted radio as Scherzinger's third international single on April 1, 2011, after previous singles met success in the United Kingdom. \"Right There\" was Scherzinger's third consecutive top three single from her debut album. The song was then re-released on May 17, 2011 in the United States, as Killer Love's lead single, and was remixed to feature two new verses from American rapper 50 Cent. It has reached over 100 million views on YouTube making it VEVO certified. The song became successful in many countries reaching the top ten in Australia, Ireland, New Zealand, Romania, Scotland and the United Kingdom. In the United States, \"Right There\", reached the top 40 on the Billboard Hot 100, becoming Scherzinger's most successful US single as solo artist to date. The song was later certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America for shipments of 500,000 copies of the single. \"Right There\" peaked at number three on the UK Singles Chart, in addition to peaking at number seven in Ireland, where it also became one of her highest charting releases. The song received generally positive reviews from music critics for having a R&B-heavy sound on a pop record. Scherzinger performed \"Right There\" live for the first time on American Idol, to coincide with the song's US release. The show's judges and studio audiences gave her a standing ovation, with the media later praising Scherzinger's vocal and dancing abilities. An accompanying music video, directed by Paul Hunter, sees Scherzinger dancing along the streets of downtown Los Angeles, California.

It became a humorous hit in Israel and many parodic cover versions were produced in response. It was a shock for Hamas. The song was originally written in Arabic and published in 2012. Due to its success in the Arab world, the song was translated into Hebrew in 2014, as a part of the psychological and propaganda fight. This version, just like the Arab version, is sung by Gazan singers and encourages terror attacks against Israel and its citizens. The choice of words, the heavy-accented pronunciation with multiple spelling errors, the excessive[clarification needed] militant propaganda of the video that accompanies it, along with the catchy tune, made the song become a humorous hit in Israel. In response, many comical versions were recorded in Israel and many parodies were posted on YouTube, not to mention it stood out in the social media as a source and topic for jokes.[citation needed] The song was removed from YouTube as a violation of YouTube's policy prohibiting hate speech and glorification of terror.

One of the B-sides, \"Sexy Northener\", was also released as a promotional single in the U.S. and peaked at #15 on the US dance charts. It never got a commercial release though. The song is infamous to Pet Shop Boys fans for its unusual video, directed by Wolfgang Tillmans, showing mice running across tracks and eating discarded food at Tottenham Court Road tube station. There are only several short shots of the duo performing. Many felt this was a strange choice for the video of a lead single, and that because of its commercially unappealing video, the song did not achieve the level of success it could have. The track was remixed the same year by German trance duet Blank & Jones."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"Never Too Much\" is a song performed by Luther Vandross. The disco-oriented song was released in 1981, as the lead single from the album of the same name. The title track hit number one on the soul singles chart and peaked at number thirty-three on the Billboard Hot 100. The album (Vandross's first as a solo artist) was popular, although it failed to sell in large numbers initially. Sales were boosted by his other chart successes and, eventually, by his death.[citation needed] A remixed version of the song reached No.13 on the UK singles chart in November 1989. The single is also included on his later album Luther Vandross - The Ultimate, which was released in 2001. The single was released alongside a music video in which he is shown singing in a recording studio. The song was used in the soundtrack for the Rockstar Games title Grand Theft Auto: Vice City on the in-game radio station Emotion 98.3. The song, sans vocals, was sampled by Will Smith (a.k.a. The Fresh Prince) in \"Can't Wait To Be With You\" on his 1993 hit album Code Red. Smith also used the vocal melody and lyrics from the song's chorus in \"1,000 Kisses\" on his 2002 album Born to Reign. The first minute of this song is used in the WKRP In Cincinnati episode \"Fire\" from season four, until it is unceremoniously cut off by Les Nessman when he reports that the Flimm Building is on fire."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"Bad Romance\" is a song by American singer Lady Gaga from her third extended play, The Fame Monster (2009). It was written and produced by Gaga and RedOne. Lyrically, \"Bad Romance\" explores Gaga's attraction to individuals with whom romance never works, her preference for lonely relationships and the paranoia she experienced while on tour. Following an illegal demo leak, Gaga showcased the final product at Alexander McQueen's show at the Paris Fashion Week in October 2009, followed by the release of the single's cover art. Musically, \"Bad Romance\" features a spoken bridge, a full-throated chorus and sung lyrics about being in love with one's best friend. The song, which is imbued with elements of Germanesque house and techno, as well as music from 1980s and the 1990s, was touted by Gaga as an experimental pop record. The song contains a few lines in French. Most commentators were enticed by \"Bad Romance\", which they declared one of the highlights of The Fame Monster album. It was included in the 'best-of' lists in several media outlets such as Rolling Stone and Pitchfork Media, and acquired two Grammy Awards for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance and Best Short Form Music Video. In the United States, \"Bad Romance\" peaked at number two on the Billboard Hot 100, and it has been certified eleven-times platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), having sold nearly 5.6 million digital downloads as of April 2015. It achieved worldwide success by topping the charts in a variety of markets, ultimately selling 12 million copies worldwide, thus becoming one of the best-selling singles of all time. The accompanying music video of \"Bad Romance\" features Gaga inside a surreal white bathhouse. There, she gets kidnapped by a group of supermodels who drug her and sell her to the Russian mafia for sexual slavery. The music video ends with Gaga killing the man who bought her. The song's video garnered acclaim from critics, who not only applauded the risqu\u00E9 and symbolic nature of the plot, but its artistic direction and vivid imagery. In 2011, the music video was voted the best video of the 2000s decade by readers of Billboard. It was nominated for numerous superlatives, including ten awards at the 2010 MTV Video Music Awards, where the singer won seven, including a recognition for Video of the Year. Gaga has performed \"Bad Romance\" on various television programs, such as Saturday Night Live, at various award ceremonies, such as the 2009 American Music Awards, and in three of her tours, the most recent being ArtRave: The Artpop Ball."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"Eight Miles High\" is a song by the American rock band the Byrds, written by Gene Clark, Jim McGuinn (a.k.a. Roger McGuinn), and David Crosby and first released as a single on March 14, 1966 (see 1966 in music). Musically influenced by Ravi Shankar and John Coltrane, \"Eight Miles High\", along with its McGuinn and Crosby-penned B-side \"Why\", was influential in developing the musical styles of psychedelic rock, raga rock, and psychedelic pop. Accordingly, critics often cite \"Eight Miles High\" as being the first bona fide psychedelic rock song, as well as a classic of the counterculture era. The song was subject to a U.S. radio ban shortly after its release, following allegations published in the broadcasting trade journal the Gavin Report regarding perceived drug connotations in its lyrics. The band strenuously denied these allegations at the time, but in later years both Clark and Crosby admitted that the song was at least partly inspired by their own drug use. The failure of \"Eight Miles High\" to reach the Billboard Top 10 is usually attributed to the broadcasting ban, but some commentators have suggested that the song's complexity and uncommercial nature were greater factors. \"Eight Miles High\" reached number 14 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart and number 24 in the UK Singles Chart. The song was also included on the band's third album, Fifth Dimension, which was released on July 18, 1966. \"Eight Miles High\" became the Byrds' third and final U.S. Top 20 hit, and was also their last release before the departure of Gene Clark, the band's principal songwriter at the time."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"Let's Go Crazy\" is a 1984 song by Prince and The Revolution, from the album Purple Rain. It was the opening track on both the album and the film Purple Rain. \"Let's Go Crazy\" is one of Prince's most popular songs, and is almost always a staple for concert performances, often segueing into other hits. When released as a single, the song became Prince's second number-one hit on the Billboard Hot 100, and also topped the two component charts, the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs and Hot Dance Club Play charts, as well as becoming a UK Top 10 hit. The B-side was the lyrically controversial \"Erotic City\". In the UK, the song was released as a double A-side with \"Take Me with U\". Common to much of Prince's writing the song is thought to be exhortation to follow Christian ethics, with the \"De-elevator\" of the lyrics being a metaphor for the Devil. The extended \"Special Dance Mix\" of the song was performed in a slightly edited version in the film Purple Rain. It contains a longer instrumental section in the middle, including a solo on an apparently out-of-tune piano and some muddled lyrics, repeating the track's introduction."@en ;

Two versions of the song exist; the English-language version, which features American rapper Pitbull, and the Spanish-language version, which features Dominican rapper El Cata. It is heavily influenced by merengue and dance music. Shakira and El Cata, or Pitbull, sing about each other's sex appeal in the song. Upon its release, \"Rabiosa\" received generally favourable reviews from music critics, some of whom deemed it as one of the strongest tracks on Sale el Sol. Commercially, the English version of the song became a worldwide success, peaking atop record charts of countries like Portugal and Spain, and reaching the top ten in Belgium, France, Italy, and Switzerland. In the United States, it was successful on the Latin record charts and peaked at number eight on the Billboard Hot Latin Songs chart. \"Rabiosa\" was certified double-platinum in Mexico and platinum in Italy and Spain. An accompanying music video for the song was directed by Jaume de Laiguana and features Shakira enjoying herself in an underground party; scenes of her pole dancing are interspersed throughout the video. Critics were positive towards the video, and many noted its similarity to the music video of Shakira's 2009 single \"She Wolf\".

The single also marks the second collaboration between Game and Lil Wayne, their first collaboration being on Game's 2008 international hit single \"My Life\" from his third studio album LAX (2008), which featured vocals from Lil Wayne during the song's chorus. The song features a music sample of the nightclub hit \"Kernkraft 400\" (2000) (German for \"Nuclear Energy 400\") performed by German techno and electro band Zombie Nation from their debut album Leichenschmaus (1999). The song's sample of \"Kernkraft 400\" is considered one of the most famous songs of electronic dance music and a tune often played at sporting events. The single was also thought to be and mark[clarification needed] Game's first song to be released back under the Aftermath Entertainment and Interscope Records labels, the two record labels that released his debut studio album The Documentary (2005), after resigning back with Interscope Records back in 2009 later resigning back with Aftermath Entertainment in early 2010, and before a beef with former fellow G-Unit labelmate and group member 50 Cent caused him to release his two following albums and singles on Geffen Records, but this was proved untrue. On March 10, 2011 Game sent the single to Hip hop DJ Funkmaster Flex whom premiered it on his popular radio show on WQHT Hot 97 in New York City, New York. The song was well received by listeners unlike his previous four released singles. In the United States, \"Red Nation\" debuted at the number 62 position on the Billboard Hot 100. The music video for the song was directed by Parris, and it premiered on Thursday, May 12, 2011. The video had been banned from airing on cable networks MTV and BET due to being deemed inappropriate and being a portrayal of gang culture, causing a controversy due to Game's alleged affiliation with the notorious Los Angeles gang the Bloods. However, Game refused to let the snub derail his plans for promotion, so he still vowed to release the video online so fans can form their own opinions about the controversy for themselves. After the music video quickly received over 3 million views on YouTube, there were rumors that BET and MTV were reconsidering airing the banned \"Red Nation\" video."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"Used to Love You\" is a song by American singer and songwriter Gwen Stefani for her upcoming third solo studio album This Is What the Truth Feels Like. Stefani co-wrote the song with Justin Tranter, Julia Michaels and J.R. Rotem; the latter is also the producer. After scrapping the album and its two singles in favor to start over, Interscope Records released it as the album's first official single on October 20, 2015 to digital download and serviced to mainstream radio on October 27, 2015. \"Used to Love You\" is an emotional midtempo synthpop ballad, with its instrumentation consisting in a piano, restrained synths and drum taps. Lyrically, the song talks about a painful break-up, with the protagonist questioning why she fell in love with her ex in the first place. The song was inspired by the end of Stefani's 13-year marriage with Gavin Rossdale, being written in the wake of the couple's divorce, as confirmed by Stefani herself. Critically acclaimed, \"Used to Love You\" received praise for its lyrical content, as well as for Stefani's emotional delivery, with most critics considering it a heartbreaking song and an improvement over her 2014 releases, which she has since described as \"rushed\". Stefani first premiered the song during a concert on October 17, 2015, while its music video was released three days later. It is a single shot of Stefani in a white tank top, blue brassiere and gold necklace on a black background, emoting, and occasionally mouthing some of the words of the song. The song received its first televised performance on The Ellen DeGeneres Show on October 26, 2015."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"Walking on the Milky Way\" is a song by the British band OMD. It was released as a single in August 1996 and appeared on their Universal album a month later. The song reached #17 on the UK Singles Chart, becoming the band's first UK Top 20 single in over five years, and their last UK Top 40 entry to date. Although it was unable to crack the Top 10, the song became one of the band's biggest radio hits. It became further ingrained in public consciousness due to its use in television commercials for Mars' Milky Way chocolate bar in 1998. The group were flanked by a full string orchestra for their Top of the Pops performance of the song. Characterised by an ethereal and melancholy sound and a soaring delivery of the lyric, the song wistfully recalls the glory days of youth but cautions that time cannot be turned back. Critic Dave Thompson in AllMusic praised Andy McCluskey's vocal, and wrote: \"With its sublime melody and a suitably anthemic chorus, this stellar single, released in August 1996, was a deserving Top 20 British hit.\" McCluskey has noted that the repeated \"Hey, hey!\" refrain was written with the intention that it would become a call and response with live audiences. The B-side \"Mathew Street\" references the location of Eric's Club in Liverpool, where OMD made their first public performance."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"Winchester Cathedral\" is a song released in late 1966 by Fontana Records, whereupon it shot to the #1 spot in Canada on the RPM 100 national singles charts and shortly thereafter in the U.S. on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. It was released by The New Vaudeville Band, a British novelty group established by the song's composer, Geoff Stephens. Stephens was a big fan of tunes from the British music hall era (or what Americans would call \"vaudeville\"), so he wrote \"Winchester Cathedral\" in that vein, complete with a Rudy Vall\u00E9e soundalike(John Carter) singing through his hands to imitate a megaphone sound. Although the song was recorded entirely by session musicians, when it became an international hit, an actual band had to be assembled. The recording is one of the few charting songs to feature a bassoon. The band toured extensively under the tutelage of Peter Grant, who later went on to manage The Yardbirds and Led Zeppelin. The tune went to No. 4 in the UK Singles Chart. It went all the way to the top in the U.S., however, displacing \"You Keep Me Hangin' On\" by the Supremes on December 3, 1966. After a one-week run at No. 1, \"Winchester Cathedral\" was knocked off the summit by the Beach Boys' \"Good Vibrations\", only to rebound to the top spot the following week. After two additional weeks, it was knocked off the top for good by \"I'm a Believer\" by The Monkees. \"Winchester Cathedral\" topped the Billboard Easy Listening chart for four weeks. Cover records by Dana Rollin and The New Happiness reached no higher than No. 70.The Shadows recorded an instrumental version of this song on their album, Jigsaw. The Four Freshmen also recorded a cover of this song on their 1968 album In a Class by Themselves. Frank Sinatra also recorded a version of this song for his 1966 album \"That's Life.\" Global sales of the single were over three million, with the RIAA certification of gold disc status. The song won the 1967 Grammy Award for Best Contemporary (R&R) Recording, despite not being a rock and roll song. An initial long-playing album including the song was issued in late 1966 by Fontana Records, also titled Winchester Cathedral. Stephens received the 1966 Ivor Novello award for \"Best Song Musically and Lyrically\". On March 11 2016 to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the song's release, a new version by Geoff Stephens will be released on CD by Signum Classics sung by the choristers of Winchester Cathedral. The premier performance of this version will take place during a Gala Concert in Winchester Cathedral on March 12 to help raise funds for the Cathedral's Appeal."@en ;

It is the first of three singles (and four songs) to be co-written for the group by Motown songwriter Roger Penzabene. It reached number three on the U.S. R&B chart and number six on the U.S. Pop chart. It would be the third single from the group's 1967 album The Temptations with a Lot o' Soul. This is one of the small handful of A-sides led by Eddie Kendricks since David Ruffin (who leads on the bridge and ad-libs on the outro) became the Tempt's lead singer, the last one was the 1966 song \"Get Ready\". As the song's main narrator, Kendricks tells his girl just how much she really means to him. There is real sentiment behind the song's words, as lyricist Penzabene wrote his songs as personal statements to his wife, to let her know how much he cared about. Later he would find out she had been unfaithful to him and publicized his pain in the songs, \"I Wish It Would Rain\" and \"I Could Never Love Another (After Loving You)\", to show her how much he was hurt by her. After both of those songs were completed and recorded, Penzabene committed suicide. The single is backed by a cover of The Miracles \"I've Been Good To You\", also led by Kendricks. As such it is one of the handful of singles by The Temptations where both sides charted (it peaked at 24 on the Billboard Bubbling Under Hot 100 charts)."@en ;

She refuses to let Curtis leave her behind, and boldly proclaims to him, \"I'm staying and you ... you're gonna love me.\" In addition to its presence in the musical, \"And I Am Telling You I'm Not Going\" is also notable as the debut single of two women who portrayed Effie. Jennifer Holliday originated the role on Broadway in 1981 and won a Tony Award for her performance as well as the Grammy for Best R&B Performance, Female for its re-release in 1982 for which it became a number-one R&B hit for Holliday. Jennifer Hudson portrayed Effie in the 2006 film adaptation of Dreamgirls, winning an Oscar for the role. Hudson's version became a Top 20 R&B single, and a number-one dance hit."@en .

	dbo:abstract	"\"Baby I'm Gettin' Better\" is the second single from Australian alternative rock band, Gyroscope's fourth studio album, Cohesion. It was released digitally on 17 May 2010. The single become the second top 40 hit from Cohesion on the ARIA Singles Chart, which peaked at No. 34 and spent a total of fourteen weeks in the top 50. The song is the group's third highest charting single behind previous singles \"Some of the Places I Know\" and \"Snakeskin\". By the end of the year it was certified gold by ARIA. \"Baby, I'm Gettin' Better\" polled at No. 40 on national radio, Triple J's Hottest 100 for 2010. In interview by Lucy Valentine for the [AU] Review, with Rob Nassif, the band's drummer revealed that \"We originally weren't gonna record it because the original version of that song is like an acoustic country tune. And we really liked the tune, we always thought it had great melodies and a great chorus, but we always felt it was a country tune and we were trying to write a rock record.\" Gil Norton, the album's producer, coaxed the band to re-do it: \"He encouraged us to rock it up, and the rocked up version is what you hear on the album!\" In a review at Sputnik Music, Mike Allen, considers that the song \"conveys Sanders at a compelling and passionate level, as he elevates a rather uneventful track with the assistance of some warming harmonies. Most significantly, Sanders exhibits the capability of precisely accentuating the mood; solidifying his role as an effective front-man.\""@en ;

It was met by widespread commercial recognition, peaking at No. 11 on the Billboard Hot 100 and becoming West's fourth consecutive top twenty hit in the United States. The single was accompanied by three separate music videos, each of which visually interpreted a portion of its multifaceted context in different ways. \"Jesus Walks\" continues to be a crowd favorite and stands as one of the most-performed songs by West, who has included it within all of his headlining tours. At the 47th Grammy Awards, \"Jesus Walks\" was awarded the Grammy for Best Rap Song. Rolling Stone named the song No. 19 on their list of 100 Best Songs of the 2000s.

The title is inspired by the \u201Ctypical psychobabble\u201D present in talk shows. The music for the song was inspired by the song \u201CHold on Loosely\u201D by 38 Special."@en ;

The song's success, in the wake of the relative underperformance of the previous Temptations single, \"Get Ready\", resulted in Norman Whitfield replacing Smokey Robinson, producer of \"Get Ready\", as The Temptations' main producer. In 2004 it finished #94 in AFI's 100 Years...100 Songs poll thanks to its inclusion in The Big Chill soundtrack.

The song contains a mixture of cultures, mostly influenced by the exotic language of Fern\u00E1ndez, that is Spanish, and Beyonc\u00E9's pop and R&B influences. Along with Jaime Flores and Reyli Barba, Beyonc\u00E9 wrote the song, while Rudy P\u00E9rez and Beyonc\u00E9 herself produced the song. \"Amor Gitano\" serves as the theme song of the telenovela El Zorro and it was released on February 12, 2007 during the premiere of the episode of the telenovela. \"Amor Gitano\" generally received positive reception from music critics. While some of them complimented the vocal exchanges between both artists and the flamenco pop genre of the song, others criticized the song for being somehow offensive due to the stereotypical lyrics. Although it failed to make any impact on the main US Billboard Hot 100 chart, it charted on a few Billboard component charts, peaking at number twenty-three on the US Latin Pop Songs chart. Achieving multi-platinum certifications for ringtones and digital downloads in Spain, the song remained at the top of the Spanish Singles charts for thirteen weeks, becoming Beyonc\u00E9's second Spanish chart-topping single, the first being \"Beautiful Liar\" (2007). \"Amor Gitano\" is ranked at number one on the list of best-selling singles in Spain."@en ;

dbr:Every_Heartbeat	rdf:type	dbo:MusicalWork ;
	dbo:abstract	"\"Every Heartbeat\" is a 1991 single by American Christian music singer Amy Grant. It was released as the third single from the Heart In Motion album, though it was the second from the album to be released to mainstream pop radio. After the unexpected major success of Grant's previous single, \"Baby Baby,\" which topped both the United States' Billboard Hot 100 and Adult Contemporary charts, there seemed the question on how to follow it up. The chosen single was \"Every Heartbeat,\" and although it did not hit number one, it still managed to make the #2 spot on the Hot 100 and the Adult Contemporary chart for one and six weeks respectively. In both cases Every Heartbeat was kept from the top spot by Bryan Adams' song \"(Everything I Do) I Do It for You\". Charlie Peacock wrote the song's music and chorus lyrics, with Grant and Wayne Kirkpatrick composing the remaining lyrics. In 2004, Sixpence None The Richer covered \"Every Heartbeat\" on the album Full Circle: A Celebration of Songs and Friends, which commemorated Charlie Peacock's 20-year anniversary as a solo recording artist. Mark Lowry parodied the song with the title \"Every Teacher\". In 2014, the song was included on Grant's remix compilation album titled In Motion: The Remixes. A digital remix EP was released on iTunes in support of the album which charted at number 13 on the Billboard Hot Dance Club Songs chart. In 1992 Kids Incorporated covered \"Every Heartbeat\" in the Season 8 episode \"Old Friends\"."@en ;

It was written by Fergie and The Black Eyed Peas bandmate will.i.am, who also produced the song as well as providing the instrumentation and additional vocals. The song was slated as the second single from the album and released for airplay on October 23, 2006. \"Fergalicious\" is an electro song with R&B and hip hop characteristics. It contains compositional samples of \"Supersonic\", a song written by Dania Maria Birks, Juana Michelle Burns, Juanita A. Lee, Kim Nazel, and Fatima Shaheed and performed by J. J. Fad, and \"Give It All You Got\", a song written by Derrick Rahming and popularized by Afro-Rican. The song's bridge contains an interpolation of \"Night Train\" by Jimmy Forrest and James Brown. The critical reception of \"Fergalicious\" was positive, with many praising it as a catchy and danceable track. Some music critics compared the song to \"My Humps\" (2006), a single released by The Black Eyed Peas from their fourth studio album Monkey Business (2005). \"Fergalicious\" was a commercial success in the United States and moderately so in several other countries. In the United States, it peaked at number two on the Billboard Hot 100 and at number one on the Pop Songs chart. \"Fergalicious\" was certified double platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America and sold over three million digital units, becoming Fergie's second best selling song in the United States. In Australia and New Zealand, the song peaked at numbers four and five respectively and received gold certifications. In Europe, the song peaked within the top thirty on several different charts across the continent, including high positions in Finland, Norway, Belgium and France.

dbr:Four_Sticks	rdf:type	dbo:MusicalWork ;
	dbo:abstract	"\"Four Sticks\" is a song by the English rock band Led Zeppelin from their 1971 fourth album and is the sixth track from the LP. The title came from the fact that drummer, John Bonham, played with two sets of two drumsticks, totalling four. His decision to play the song with four sticks was a result of him being very frustrated with not being able to get the track down right during recording sessions at Island Studios. After he grabbed the second pair of sticks and beat the drums as hard as he could, he recorded the perfect take and that was the one they kept. This song was particularly difficult to record, and required more takes than usual. John Paul Jones played a VCS3 synthesizer on the track. Guitarist Jimmy Page once said of the song: \"It was supposed to be abstract.\" The abstract effect is further achieved by the unusual time signature of the song, featuring riffs in a mixture of 5/8 and 6/8 time signatures. After another failed take during the recording, Jimmy began to play an improvised guitar riff out of frustration. That riff was later on developed into the second track of the album, \"Rock and Roll\". The song was re-recorded by Jimmy Page and Robert Plant with the Bombay Symphony Orchestra in 1972, during their trip to India, along with another track, \"Friends\" from Led Zeppelin III. This version featured tabla drums and sitars. The recordings were finally released officially on the 2015 remastering of Coda. The project is said to have run into problems because the orchestra didn't keep time in the Western style and some of them drank rather a lot. The band is only known to have played this song live once, at Copenhagen on their 1971 European tour, as has been preserved on some bootleg recordings. Also in 1994, Robert Plant and Jimmy Page had rejoined in musical collaboration as Page and Plant. On 25 August and 26, live performances were taped in London, Wales, and Morocco with Egyptian and Moroccan orchestration of several Led Zeppelin tunes - \"Four Sticks\" was one of them, and the arrangement features drummer Michael Lee playing with four sticks as well as multiple percussionists such as Hossam Ramzy. This new version of \"Four Sticks\" was also included on the album No Quarter: Jimmy Page and Robert Plant Unledded, and live performances were so successful commercially and artistically that the ensemble coordinated a 1995/1996 world tour. Robert Plant played a version of the song during his solo tour in 2005, as is included on the DVD release Soundstage: Robert Plant and the Strange Sensation, although drummer Clive Deamer only plays with two sticks. A different version of this song is featured on the remastered deluxe 2CD version of Led Zeppelin IV. Known as \"Four Sticks (Alternate Mix)\", it was recorded on November 2, 1970, at Island Studios, No. 2, in London with engineer Andy Johns and assistant engineer Tony. This mix runs 4:33, while the original version runs 4:45."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"I'll Be Lovin' U Long Time\" is a song by American singer-songwriter Mariah Carey, taken from her eleventh studio album, E=MC\u00B2 (2008). It was written by Carey, Aldrin Davis, Crystal Johnson and Clifford Harris, and produced by the former two. As the song's hook and instrumentation is derived from sampling DeBarge's \"Stay with Me\", Mark DeBarge and Etterlene Jordan also share songwriting credits. \"I'll Be Lovin' U Long Time\" was released as the album's third single in the United States, Australasia and select European countries on July 1, 2008. Drawing influence from pop, soul and R&B music genres, and featuring a piano and keyboard-driven melody, the song's lyrics demonstrate the lengths the protagonist will go for her lover, and how she will be 'lovin' him long time'. The song received generally positive reviews from music critics, with many considering it a highlight from the album. Many reviewers complimented its production and clever interpolation of the DeBarge sample, while some criticized it for being too simple for an artist of Carey's caliber. Though expected by critics to have surely become Carey's nineteenth chart-topping single in the United States, the track only managed to reach a peak position of number fifty-eight on the Billboard Hot 100. Throughout other countries where it was released, the song achieved relatively weak charting, peaking within the top forty in Japan and Slovakia, and peaking at numbers sixty-nine and eighty-four in Canada and the United Kingdom, respectively. Carey performed \"I'll Be Lovin' U Long Time\" on few live televised appearances, in comparison to the strong promotional boost the album's lead single, \"Touch My Body\" received. She first performed the song live at the MTV Video Music Awards Japan, on June 2, 2008. On July 31, 2008, she performed the song as part of a five-piece outdoor concert filmed for Jimmy Kimmel Live!, as well as at the 2008 Teen Choice Awards to a standing ovation on August 8, 2008. Additionally, it was featured on the final scene of You Don't Mess with the Zohan (2008), a film in which Carey made a cameo appearance. The song's accompanying music video was shot over a three-day interval in Hawaii, and makes usage of the islands scenery, as well as shots of Carey in several bikinis, while swimming with a dolphin."@en ;

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mr._Spaceman>	rdf:type	dbo:MusicalWork ;
	dbo:abstract	"\"Mr. Spaceman\" is a song by the American rock band The Byrds and was the third track on their 1966 album Fifth Dimension. The song was initially written by band member Jim McGuinn as a \"melodramatic screenplay\" but it soon evolved into a whimsical meditation on the existence of extraterrestrial life. After its appearance on Fifth Dimension, \"Mr. Spaceman\" was released as the third single taken from that album in September 1966 (see 1966 in music). The single reached #36 on the Billboard Hot 100 but failed to chart in the United Kingdom. Written in early 1966 by McGuinn, the song was\u2014along with \"5D (Fifth Dimension)\"\u2014one of two science fiction-themed songs on the Fifth Dimension album. Upon its release as a single, the music press coined the term \"space-rock\" to describe the song, although since then, the term has come to refer to a genre of rock music originating from 1970s progressive and psychedelic music. Musically, \"Mr. Spaceman\" has a country-style backing, albeit with touches of psychedelia, and can clearly be seen as a precursor to the band's later exploration of country music on Sweetheart of the Rodeo. As such, the song is often cited as being one of the earliest examples of the country rock genre. The title also recalled that of The Byrds' earlier worldwide smash hit and debut single, \"Mr. Tambourine Man\". The single release of the song was accompanied by a spoof press announcement from The Byrds' co-manager, Eddie Tickner, stating that he had taken out a $1,000,000 insurance policy with Lloyd's of London against his clients being kidnapped by extraterrestrial visitors. Despite Tickner's statement being an obvious publicity stunt and the deliberately tongue-in-cheek nature of the song's lyrics, both McGuinn and fellow band member David Crosby felt hopeful about communicating with alien life forms through the medium of AM radio broadcast. In a later interview with Pete Frame for ZigZag magazine, McGuinn explained how he believed that this would have been possible: \"I was interested in astronomy and the possibility of connecting with extraterrestrial life and I thought that it might work the other way round, if we tried to contact them. I thought that the song being played on the air might be a way of getting through to them. But even if there had been anybody up there listening, they wouldn't have heard because I found out later that AM airwaves diffuse in space too rapidly.\" During the 1960s and early 1970s, the band performed the song on the television programs The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour, Where the Girls Are and The David Frost Show. Additionally, the song would go on to become a staple of The Byrds' live concert repertoire, until their final disbandment in 1973. The song was also performed live by a reformed line-up of The Byrds featuring Roger McGuinn, David Crosby and Chris Hillman in January 1989. The song was broadcast as a wake-up call to the astronauts aboard shuttle mission STS-41-D on September 2, 1984. In addition to its appearance on the Fifth Dimension album, \"Mr. Spaceman\" also appears on several Byrds' compilations, including The Byrds' Greatest Hits, History of The Byrds, The Original Singles: 1965\u20131967, Volume 1, The Byrds, The Very Best of The Byrds, The Essential Byrds and There Is a Season. Live performances of the song are included on the live portion of The Byrds' (Untitled) album as well as on Live at Royal Albert Hall 1971. The song \"Mr. Spaceman\" written by Jim McGuinn (aka Roger McGuinn) should not be confused with the Steve Weber song \"Mister Spaceman\", found on The Holy Modal Rounders' self-titled debut album."@en ;

The song features rapper Missy Elliott, as well as Pepa speaking a Jamaican chant. \"Need U Bad\" is Sullivan's debut single and the lead single from Fearless. It was first released on May 13, 2008 in the United States by J and Arista Records. The song was co-written by Sullivan in collaboration with Elliott, Cainon Lamb, and Taurian Osbourne. It was produced by Elliott and Lamb. The song uses a sample from Nicolas Taylor Stanton's \"Higher Meditation Riddim Version\", and Tapper Zukie's \"Papa Big Shirt\". \"Need U Bad\" was one of two songs on Fearless where Sullivan collaborated with Elliott and Lamb. Musically, the song was inspired to be different from typical mainstream singles. Featuring prominent elements of reggae, R&B and soul music characteristics, the track was composed in a different style to co-relate with the title of its parent album, Fearless. Lyrically, \"Need U Bad\" takes reference to a situation when one develops a strong need for one's lover. \"Need U Bad\" garnered a positive response from contemporary music critics. The single also achieved R&B chart success; peaking at number one on U.S. Billboard Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs, and at number thirty-seven on the Billboard Hot 100. It is Sullivan's most successful single on Billboard Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs to-date. \"Need U Bad\" was accompanied by a music video which was directed by Jonathan Mannion and released on July 8, 2008. The old school styled video features Sullivan singing and dancing with Missy Elliott and other reggae musicians in a recording studio. Sullivan performed \"Need U Bad\" on 106 & Park, The Ellen DeGeneres Show and The Tonight Show with Jay Leno. \"Need U Bad\" was nominated in the 'Best Female R&B Vocal Performance' category at the 51st Grammy Awards."@en ;

Originally released in August 2006, the single did not enter the Top 40 on the Billboard Hot Country Songs chart until January 2007. After the release of For the Love, radio stations began to play an alternate version of the song which featured guest vocals from Tim McGraw and Kenny Chesney, thus helping to boost the song to Number One on both the Billboard and Mediabase country singles charts. Upon reaching Number One in June 2007, \"Find out Who Your Friends Are\" set a new record for the slowest-climbing Number One single in the history of the Billboard country music chart, as well as the second-slowest climbing on any Billboard singles chart. In addition, it became Lawrence's first Billboard Number One since 1996's \"Time Marches On\", ten years earlier."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"Beat Surrender\" was The Jam's final single released on 26 November 1982. It became the band's fourth No. 1 hit in the UK Singles Chart for two weeks in December 1982. The 7\" was backed by the B-side \"Shopping\". A double 7\" and 12\" single version was available with additional studio cover versions of The Chi-Lites' \"Stoned Out of My Mind\", Curtis Mayfield's \"Move on Up\", and Edwin Starr's \"War\". The song hinted at the more soul-based style to come with Paul Weller's next band, The Style Council. It was not included on any of the band's six studio albums. In the USA, it appeared on the five-track EP, Beat Surrender (Polydor 810751), which peaked at No. 171 on the Billboard 200 album chart. The decision for the Jam's final single was between \"Beat Surrender\", \"Doctor Love*\" (which Weller wrote but instead gave to Bananarama for their album Deep Sea Skiving) and \"A Solid Bond in Your Heart\", later a Style Council single in 1983. The Jam's version of \"A Solid Bond in Your Heart\" was not released until 1992 on the Extras album, although Rick Buckler, The Jam's drummer, claimed that The Style Council had pinched his original drum track recording.[citation needed] \"Doctor Love\" was also recorded by Tracie Young, a singer on Paul Weller's Respond record label, for her album, Far from the Hurting Kind. Weller was credited on the LP as Jake Fluckery, a pseudonym that he used on more than one occasion, even on his own Style Council records; most noticeably on \"Spring, Summer, Autumn\" on the 12\" version of \"My Ever Changing Moods\". The sleeve for the single, including the 12\" and the double single pack, featured Gill Price, Weller's girlfriend at the time. \"Beat Surrender\" was previewed live on the first episode of The Tube, on 5 November 1982."@en ;

On the adult contemporary chart, the song became the group's second number-one hit (following \"You Got It All\" from the previous year). On the R&B chart, \"Make It Real\" reached number 24. Moana Wolfgramm of the Jets would recall: \"'Make It Real' was given to us at the eleventh hour [i.e. last minute]. We needed a slow ballad [when] we were finishing up the last tracks for the 'Magic' album. Our manager Don Powell, Linda Mallah and Rick Kelly wrote this song and it was simple yet very catchy. I remember Liz [Elizabeth Wolfgramm] recorded it on the road after one of our shows, I think somewhere in Texas.\" One of the two videos for \"Make It Real\" showed Elizabeth Wolfgramm singing in front of a basic blue screen background: although Elizabeth Wolfgramm was the only group member to sing on the track, still images of the other Jets were shown during the instrumental break. The other video features the entire band performing the song, with Elizabeth Wolfgramm standing in front of the other group members playing their individual instruments, interspersed with close-up shots of individual band members throughout the song. The B-side of the 7\" single is a version of \"Make It Real\" titled \"So True\". \"Make It Real\" reflects back upon a past relationship one year since the singer met her lover. The singer is reminded of the happy times in their relationship and wants another opportunity to rekindle the passion: I loved you / You didn't feel the same / Though we're apart, you're in my heart / Give me one more chance to make it real."@en ;

The song is one of the few on the album that is prominently featured in the film, accompanying the scene in which the Joker and his minions gleefully deface the exhibits in the Gotham City Art Museum before meeting Vicki Vale. The song became the only Batman single to perform better in the UK charts, where it peaked at number 14, as opposed to the U.S. (where it peaked at number 18). The upbeat and humorous number features horn samples and Prince's sped-up \"Camille\" vocals, as well as a vocal performance by Anna Fantastic. The 12\" single extends the song to about six minutes in length (labeled as the \"Video Mix\"), and features the B-side \"Feel U Up\", a previously unreleased Camille track which would later be available on The Hits/The B-Sides compilation. \"Feel U Up\" was originally cut in 1981, but re-recorded in 1986 for the Camille album. Despite being intended for a totally different project, the horn arrangement and vocal style complement \"Partyman\" perfectly. The 12\" single also included a \"Purple Party Mix\", which starts with a string of samples from Prince's earlier hits and contains different lyrics. A track identified as a \"music mix\" is an instrumental of the \"Purple Party Mix\". The song's accompanying music video, directed by Albert \"Al\" Magnoli, again presents Prince's \"Gemini\" persona dressed in a \"half-Joker\" costume. Owing to licensing problems, \"Partyman\", like all of the Batman-era hits, has failed to appear on any Prince compilation album, barring the UK singles promoting The Hits/The B-Sides."@en ;

It was released digitally in the United Kingdom in March 2007.

The song has been performed on a number of live appearances by Furtado, including her third headlining Get Loose Tour.

dbr:Silent_Lucidity	rdf:type	dbo:MusicalWork ;
	dbo:abstract	"\"Silent Lucidity\" is a single by the American progressive metal band Queensr\u00FFche from the 1990 album Empire. The song was the biggest hit for the band: peaked at #9 on the Billboard Hot 100 and at #1 on the Billboard Album Rock Tracks chart. The song was composed by lead guitarist Chris DeGarmo. Queensryche performed the song live at the Grammy Awards of 1992, for being nominated in the category of \"Best Rock Song\", and featured a supporting orchestra. The song did not win the Grammy, but it did however win the \"MTV Viewer's Choice Award\" for its music video. Because of the lyrical content, and the title of the song, it is assumed to be based on the subject of lucid dreaming. During the middle eight, a heavily vocoded voice even explains a method for this: \"Visualize your dream. Record it in the present tense. Put it into a permanent form. If you persist in your efforts, you can achieve dream control.\" The song was recorded with sweeping orchestrations. Often the orchestra is not relegated to the background but instead is very prominent such as during the second half of the instrumental section (timestamp 3:16 - 3:51). At the end of the song (5:26), a cello or double bass plays the theme from the traditional Brahms' Lullaby - the typical English translation words being \"Lullaby, and good night, go to sleep little baby\". \"Silent Lucidity\" is ranked #21 on VH1's list of Greatest Power Ballads."@en ;

In the United States in October 1985, the song became the only A-ha song to reach the top position of the Billboard Hot 100, due in no small part to the wide exposure on MTV of its innovative music video, directed by Steve Barron.

dbr:Turn_It_On_Again	rdf:type	dbo:MusicalWork ;
	dbo:abstract	"\"Turn It On Again\" is a single from the English rock band Genesis, from their 1980 album Duke. It reached number 8 in the UK Singles Chart. The lyrics, written by Mike Rutherford, deal with a man who does nothing more than watch his television, so much that he becomes obsessed with the people he watches on it, believing them to be his friends. The song is also characterised by a rhythmic structure uncharacteristically complex for pop music but commonplace in the band's progressive rock back catalogue, with verse/chorus sections in alternating time signatures, 64 to 74 (134), while the intro and bridge sections are in 44 and 54 (94). The song was originally much slower, written mostly by Mike Rutherford, with help from Phil Collins. He explains in the Songbook DVD \"I had this riff, [plays lead riff on guitar] but at the time I was playing it like this, [plays slower] and Phil said 'why don't you try it in a faster speed?' and then he said to me 'do you realize it is in 138?' and I said 'What do you mean it's in 13? It's in 44 isn't it?' 'No, it's 13'\". Collins confirms \"You can't dance to it. You see people trying to dance to it every now and again, they get on the off beat but they don't know why\". \"Turn It On Again\" was built out of various left-over song sections from different projects by each member: The second set of verses was originally conceived by Tony Banks for A Curious Feeling, \"We kind of put [Rutherford's riff] \u2013 the bit he didn't use on Smallcreep's Day, curiously enough \u2013 with the bit I didn't use on A Curious Feeling, and put these two together. We made it much more rocky, both bits became much more rocky, my bit was a bit more epic, and Mike's bit was a bit slower and a bit more heavy-metal. And then Phil gave it a much more straightforward drum part perhaps neither of us would ever thought that we would want that on that bit [...] We put on one or two other bits, too, that ended up from there\". The video for the song appeared on MTV's first day of broadcast. \"Turn It On Again\" has been a favourite in Genesis's live shows. Consequently, the group's 1999 compilation album Turn It On Again: The Hits (as was its 2007 expanded reissue, subtitled The Tour Edition) was named after it, as was the band's 2007 Turn It On Again: The Tour reunion tour. On their tours in the 1980s, the band would attach a medley of 1960's pop songs (referred to by the band as the \"Blues Brothers\" medley, as the first song was \"Everybody Needs Somebody to Love\"); the song would be returned to its album form for the We Can't Dance tour and the band would later regard the medley as a poor decision.[citation needed]"@en ;

In the United States, the single was promoted early in 2006 by Archie Comics through a mention in issue #167 of the group's namesake Veronica's comic, which featured a guest appearance and cover picture of The Veronicas and a card containing a code that could be used to download an MP3 version of the song free. It was also featured on the first episode of the third season of the MTV series Laguna Beach: The Real Orange County. The song was released as promo for the 2008 Ashley Tisdale's movie Picture This!. Similarly, it was also used in the film She's the Man. \"4ever\" was released as The Veronicas second UK single in late Summer 2009. The track was included on the UK version of the album Hook Me Up which was released shortly afterwards. The song debuted on the UK singles chart at number 197 on 28 September 2009, and moved up one hundred and eighty places to a new peak of 17 the following week.

dbr:Through_the_Rain	rdf:type	dbo:MusicalWork ;
	dbo:abstract	"\"Through the Rain\" is a song by American singer Mariah Carey, taken from her ninth studio album, Charmbracelet (2002). It was written by Carey and Lionel Cole, and produced by the former and Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis. The song was released as the album's lead single on October 17, 2002, and a shorter version was used as the ending credits theme for a 2002 drama known as You're Under Arrest. Classified by Carey as a ballad, it is influenced by pop and R&B music genres, and features a simple and under-stated piano melody, backed by soft electronic synthesizers. \"Through the Rain\" was meant to be an insight into Carey personal struggles throughout 2001, and lyrically talks about encouraging others. The song has been well-received, with many complimenting its inspirational lyrical content, and described it as an open window into Carey's personal life for listeners. Commercially it was Carey's lowest charting lead single to date on the US Billboard Hot 100, and her first lead single to that point to not reach the top ten in the United States. Though stalling at number 81, it managed to achieve higher placements in international markets, reaching the top in Spain and peaking within the top ten in Canada, the Netherlands, Italy, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. Carey performed \"Through the Rain\" live on several television and award show appearances around the world. She debuted the song at the 2002 NRJ Awards, and features it on a one-hour special titled Mariah Carey: Shining Through the Rain, which aired three days later on MTV. In the United States, Carey performed the song on Today, The Oprah Winfrey Show, and American Music Awards of 2003s. Throughout Europe, Carey performed the song on The Graham Norton Show and on talent competition, Fame Academy. Additionally, \"Through the Rain\" was included on the set-list of Carey's Charmbracelet World Tour: An Intimate Evening with Mariah Carey, which spanned throughout 2003\u201304. The music video, directed by Dave Meyers, was set in the late 1960s. It features a past and present story-line based on Carey's childhood, and stars J. D. Williams and Jamie-Lynn Sigler as the singer's parents. The video begins with past scenes of Carey's mother being disowned by her family after becoming romantically involved with a black man, and finds the singer in the present walking through a heavy rainstorm in New York. The song was covered on live television by Filipino singers Regine Velasquez and Charice Pempengco."@en ;

The song was also one of the few songs that was written by someone other than Ashford & Simpson, who had written several hit songs for the duo.

	dbo:abstract	"\"Love Hangover\" was the fourth number one single for Motown singer Diana Ross. Ross recorded \"Love Hangover\" in 1975. It was released in March 1976, and rose to number one on the Billboard Hot 100, Hot Soul Singles and Hot Dance Club Play charts simultaneously. The song was written by Pamela Sawyer and Marilyn McLeod as a disco number. Producer Hal Davis recorded the instrumental track in 1975 thinking it ideal for Marvin Gaye or Diana Ross, who were his two favorite vocalists to work with. He thought Diana would be sexier on it, so he recorded the song with her. Background vocals on the track were provided by Motown's in-house trio, The Andantes. Hal Davis instructed the song's engineer Russ Terrana to install a strobe light so that Ross could be in the \"disco\" mindset. As the song changed from ballad to uptempo, Ross became more comfortable with the material; she hummed, sang bit parts, laughed, danced around and even imitated Billie Holiday. The carefree and sensual nature of Ross' vocals and the music's direction helped to sell the song. The song was released on the Diana Ross LP in February, 1976. The lead single from the album was \"I Thought It Took A Little Time.\" Singing group The 5th Dimension also released \"Love Hangover\" as a single. Motown then issued Ross' version on 45. Both versions entered the chart the same day. By the time Ross' version of \"Love Hangover\" went to number one, Ross had reinvented herself as a disco diva and The 5th Dimension's version had peaked at number 80.

	dbo:abstract	"\"Runaway Child, Running Wild\" (shown as \"Run Away Child, Running Wild\" on the label of the original single) is a 1969 hit single for the Gordy (Motown) label, performed by The Temptations and produced by Norman Whitfield. The single was both the second from their landmark Cloud Nine LP, and the second of their \"psychedelic soul\" tracks penned by Whitfield and former Motown artist Barrett Strong. Featuring all five Temptations - Dennis Edwards, Eddie Kendricks, Paul Williams, Melvin Franklin, and Otis Williams - trading verses and harmony lines, \"Runaway Child, Running Wild\" paints a tale of a young boy (presumably a preteen) who runs away from home after being punished for playing hooky. The boy wanders the dark streets alone, eventually realizing he cannot survive on his own, but cannot find his way home, and ends up lost, frightened by strangers, unfamiliar landmarks, and his own thoughts. \"Runaway child runnin' wild,\" the Temptations tell the boy during the chorus, \"you better go back home/where you belong\". The Temptations alternately express and depict his fears, with the tension of the record building to a climax over the first five minutes of the record. At this point, the vocals fade out, and the record briefly gives voice to its young protagonist, who cries desperately for his mother before fading into the mix. \"Runaway Child\" then segues into an extended instrumental passage, during which Earl Van Dyke's organ, Joe Messina's electric guitar, and Dennis Coffey's distorted wah-wah pedal guitar take center stage for four minutes. After the instrumental builds the song up to a second climax, the track is stripped to a bassline and repeating hi-hat figure, and The Temptations return to the mix to issue one final admonition to the runaway: \"Listen to your heart beat/it's beating much too fast/go back home/where you belong\". The single version of \"Runaway Child\" only features the first five minutes of the song, fading out before the instrumental section begins. \"Runaway Child, Running Wild\" is often cited as one of the best songs on the subject of runaways, and Temptation Otis Williams often hears from fans that the record's terrifying depiction of running away kept them from doing so as children. The single peaked at number one on the Billboard Hot Rhythm & Blues Singles, and reached #6 on the Billboard Pop Singles chart. Earl Van Dyke, who performs the prominent organ solo during the instrumental section of the record, recorded his own instrumental version of \"Runaway Child, Running Wild\", which was released as a single the same year."@en ;

dbr:Son_of_a_Preacher_Man	rdf:type	dbo:MusicalWork ;
	dbo:abstract	"\"Son of a Preacher Man\" is a song recorded by Dusty Springfield in September 1968 and featured on the album Dusty in Memphis. It was written by John Hurley and Ronnie Wilkins. The song was originally offered to Aretha Franklin, who turned it down. However, it was recorded by Aretha's elder sister Erma Franklin and was included on her 1969 Brunswick album Soul Sister. It was only upon hearing Springfield's version, a UK and American hit in 1969, that Aretha Franklin reconsidered and recorded the song herself including it on her 1970 album, This Girl's in Love with You, and it charted only as a less popular a-side of the b-side hit single \"Call Me\". Springfield's version was produced by Jerry Wexler, Tom Dowd and Arif Mardin for her first album for the Atlantic Records label and became an international hit reaching No.10 in the United States and No.9 in her native UK when released in late 1968. The album Dusty in Memphis was released in stereo though its singles were remixed and released in mono. \"Son of a Preacher Man\" was to be the last Top Ten chart hit for the artist for almost 20 years until she teamed up with Pet Shop Boys for the single \"What Have I Done to Deserve This?\" in 1987."@en ;

dbr:The_Simpsons_Theme	rdf:type	dbo:MusicalWork ;
	dbo:abstract	"\"The Simpsons Theme\", also referred to as \"The Simpsons Main Title Theme\" in album releases, is the theme music of the animated television series The Simpsons. It plays during the opening sequence and was composed by Danny Elfman in 1989, after series creator Matt Groening approached him requesting a retro-style theme. The piece, which took 3 days, 2 hours, 48 minutes, and 19 seconds to create, has been noted by Elfman as the most popular of his career. The theme, as used for the opening sequence, was re-arranged during season 2, and the current arrangement by Alf Clausen was introduced at the beginning of the third season. It has also been edited many times to coincide with edits of various lengths for the opening sequence, and there have been extended edits and re-recordings for lengthened opening sequences. Several versions of the saxophone solo riff, ostensibly played by character Lisa Simpson in the animated sequence, have been created over the course of the series. The theme is in the acoustic scale. A slightly different arrangement of the theme usually plays over the end credits of the show. Originally, there were two main versions of the closing theme, with the longer version ending in a lower key. Both versions were re-arranged for season 3, but only the short version was in use by the time the show switched domestic production from Klasky Csupo to Film Roman season 4, and that version was edited to be even shorter by the end of season 6. The alternate longer closing theme however resurfaced in a handful of post-season 4 episodes, but mostly in credit sequences that do not play music during the first half of the sequence (either with dialogue heard underneath or video footage playing under the first half of the credits)."@en ;

dbr:Watcher_of_the_Skies	rdf:type	dbo:MusicalWork ;
	dbo:abstract	"\"Watcher of the Skies\" is the first track on Genesis' 1972 album Foxtrot. The title is borrowed from John Keats' 1817 poem \"On First Looking into Chapman's Homer\": The song was frequently used to open the group's live performances and features as the first track on their 1973 live album Genesis Live. The song opens with a Mellotron intro. According to Tony Banks, the introductory section was intended to take advantage of idiosyncrasies in the tuning of the Mellotron model he was using at the time: The two chords in question are Bmaj7/F# and C#/F#. The long keyboard introduction crossfades into the main ensemble section, which features a prominent single-note staccato pattern in a 6/4 time signature (reminiscent of the 5/4 rhythmic pattern from \"Mars\" in Gustav Holst's The Planets suite)[citation needed] played over a pattern of sustained organ chords. Following the vocal sections of the song, there is an unusual polyrhythm part, where the staccato riff changes to 8/4 time, played against a Mellotron/organ chord part in 6/4. The lyric was written by Banks and Mike Rutherford during a soundcheck for a gig in Naples. While they were surveying the deserted landscape of the airfield where they were rehearsing, they wondered what an empty Earth would look like in this state if surveyed by an alien visitor. The lyrics were influenced by the Arthur C. Clarke 1953 science fiction novel Childhood's End (as were Pink Floyd's 1972 \"Childhood's End\" and Van Der Graaf Generator's 1976 \"Childlike Faith in Childhood's End\"). It opened the band's shows during 1972\u201374 and (in abridged form) remained a staple in the band's live set into the 1980s. In later years, it has been played in a medley following the track \"It\" (from 1974 The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway), as can be heard on Three Sides Live (1982). The song was never performed with lyrics after Gabriel's departure. During performances, Peter Gabriel wore bat wings on the side of his head, glowing UV make-up around his eyes, and a multicoloured cape. The song was re-recorded in 1972 in a radically altered and shortened single version. This version was re-released in 1998 as part of the Genesis Archive 1967-75 box set. The song title was used in naming of the tribute album Watcher of the Skies: Genesis Revisited (1996) by ex-Genesis member Steve Hackett. On the album, the lead vocal was provided by John Wetton. In the liner notes to the album, Steve Hackett wrote: The song was performed live by Phish at the 2010 Rock & Roll Hall of Fame induction ceremony on 15 March 2010 at the Waldorf-Astoria hotel in New York City. The band also performed \"No Reply at All\" after Trey Anastasio's induction speech."@en ;

dbr:I_Could_Never_Take_the_Place_of_Your_Man	rdf:type	dbo:MusicalWork ;
	dbo:abstract	"\"I Could Never Take the Place of Your Man\" was the fourth and final single from Prince's 1987 double album, Sign \u201C\u262E\u201D the Times. The track was originally cut in Prince's home studio in 1982. It was brought out of the vault and updated for the unreleased, final album with The Revolution, Dream Factory. At this time, the song had a few seconds of the bluesy coda just before the main guitar solo. It was edited out before Sign \u201C\u262E\u201D the Times. The song is an upbeat pop number featuring a combination of live drumming with two drum machine patterns.[citation needed] Also featured are two guitar solos, one wild and energetic and one more bluesy and subdued in the full album cut. The song also features small elements of alternative music. The song consists of two verses and two choruses, followed by a lengthy instrumental coda. The lyrics paint the image of a woman seeking a man to replace the one who left, while Prince refuses, saying that she would not be satisfied with a one-night stand. The music and accompanying music video pushed this song to the top 10 in the US. The video was pulled from the Sign \u201C\u262E\u201D the Times film, and is a live take of the song and included the horn section of Eric Leeds and Atlanta Bliss. The live version of \"I Could Never Take the Place of Your Man\" from the video and Sign \u201C\u262E\u201D the Times film includes a horn solo in the song's coda. The solo lifts a part of the \"Camille\" and Black Album track, \"Rock Hard In a Funky Place\"."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"Ain't That a Shame\" is a song written by Fats Domino and Dave Bartholomew. Released by Imperial Records in 1955, the song was a hit for Domino, eventually selling a million copies. It reached #1 on the \"Black Singles\" chart and #10 on the \"Pop Singles\" chart. The song is ranked #438 on the Rolling Stone magazine's list of The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time. The song gained national fame after being re-recorded by white recording artist Pat Boone. Domino's version soon became more popular, bringing Domino's music to the mass market a half dozen years after his first major recording, \"The Fat Man\". After \"Ain't That a Shame\", mainstream artists began covering Domino's songs. Teresa Brewer, for instance, performed the Domino rewrite of a folk song called \"Bo Weevil\". The Four Seasons version hit #22 on the Billboard charts in 1963. According to legend, Pat Boone suggested the title and lyrics be altered to \"Isn't That A Shame\" to make it more appealing to a broader audience but was dissuaded by his producers. Despite his suggestion being rejected, Boone had his first Billboard number-one single in 1955. Domino complimented Boone's cover of the song. Boone likes to tell the story about a Fats Domino concert and Domino invited Boone on stage. Domino showed a big gold ring and said \"Pat Boone bought me this ring.\" This was the first song that John Lennon learned to play. He later covered it on Rock 'n' Roll."@en ;

It was released on July 8, 2003 by RCA Records as the fourth single from the album. The track was written and produced by Scott Storch, with additional songwriting by Aguilera and Matt Morris. An R&B and hip hop song with dancehall elements, \"Can't Hold Us Down\" has a feminist theme as it criticizes gender-related double standards. \"Can't Hold Us Down\" received mixed reviews from music critics, who were ambivalent towards its production and composition. It was nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals at the 2004 ceremony, although it lost to \"Whenever I Say Your Name\" by Sting and Mary J. Blige. The track was moderately successful on national record charts, peaking at number 12 on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 and charting within the top ten of several countries, including Australia and United Kingdom. \"Can't Hold Us Down\" was certified gold by the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA). A music video for \"Can't Hold Us Down\" was directed by David LaChapelle, and was inspired by the Lower East Side of New York City during the 1980s. Aguilera performed the song during her three major concert tours: Justified and Stripped Tour (2003), The Stripped Tour (2003) and Back to Basics Tour (2006\u201307).

dbr:Get_Your_Number	rdf:type	dbo:MusicalWork ;
	dbo:abstract	"\"Get Your Number\" is a song by American singer-songwriter Mariah Carey. It was written by Carey, Jermaine Dupri, Johnt\u00E1 Austin and Bryan-Michael Cox, and produced by the former two and LRoc. It was released as the third international single from Carey's tenth studio album, The Emancipation of Mimi (2005). The song is built around a sample of \"Just an Illusion\" (1982) by British band Imagination. Due to the inclusion of the sample, several other writers are credited as songwriters. Lyrically, the song features the protagonist persistently asking for the phone number of an individual at a club. The song received generally mixed reviews from music critics at the time of its release, with many both praising and criticizing the inclusion of the sample, as well as the song's production and lyrical content. \"Get Your Number\" was released as the third single throughout Europe, where it peaked within the top-ten in Finland, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom, where it was sold as a double A-side along with \"Shake It Off\". Similarly, the song found release in Australasia in early 2006, as the fifth single from the album, and peaked in the top-twenty in Australia, and at number thirty-four in New Zealand. The single's music video was directed by Jake Nava, who also directed Carey's video for \"Shake It Off\". It was filmed in Los Angeles on September 1 and 2, 2005 and features Jermaine Dupri as the video's secondary artist, while Michael Ealy, plays Carey's love interest at the club. The main setting is a nightclub where Carey slips her phone number to a man, one digit at a time. Carey is shown in a variety of locations wearing, amongst other outfits, a yellow latex dress. Dupri makes a guest appearance as a man receiving the numbers of three girls in the club."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"No Sex (in the Champagne Room)\" is a comedic spoken word track released by Chris Rock on his 1999 album, Bigger & Blacker, with a background chorus sung by Gerald Levert. Intended as a parody of Baz Luhrmann's \"Everybody's Free (To Wear Sunscreen)\", Rock gives one-line tidbits of advice purportedly aimed at \"the GED class of 1999\". Targets of Rock's wit include parties with metal detectors, Hooters, women who don't look their age, Ol' Dirty Bastard and Coolio, horoscopes, and people with tongue piercings. The chorus, repeated several times, affirms that \"no matter what a stripper tells you/There's no sex in the Champagne Room.\" This line was later quoted by Wyclef Jean in his own missive on exotic dancers, \"Perfect Gentleman\". Rock's song received frequent play on the radio, and as a music video (directed by Little X) on MTV, where it ranked 43rd on TRL's \"Top 99 of '99\" after premiering on July 13, 1999.

dbr:The_Old_Apartment	rdf:type	dbo:MusicalWork ;
	dbo:abstract	"\"The Old Apartment\" is a song by the Canadian alternative rock group Barenaked Ladies. It was the band's first entry on the Billboard Hot 100, and appears on the albums Born on a Pirate Ship, Rock Spectacle and Disc One: All Their Greatest Hits. The music video for the song which garnered a Best Director nomination at the 1997 MuchMusic Video Awards, was directed by fellow Canadian and fan Jason Priestley at his own suggestion. Steven Page has said that the song was partly inspired by \"Back to the Old House\" by The Smiths.[citation needed] While some[weasel words] have misinterpreted the lyrics to mean that the man in the song is stalking an ex-girlfriend and breaks into her apartment to terrorize her, Page has said that this is definitely not the case.[citation needed] The person in the song and his girlfriend are still together and happy, having \"bought an old house on the Danforth\" (Danforth Avenue in Toronto). However, he goes back to visit \"the old apartment\" \"where we used to live,\" and winds up breaking in to reminisce. Although recalling \"broken glass,\" the \"crooked landing, crooked landlord,\" and other disadvantages, he nonetheless feels nostalgia for \"fading memories / blending into dull tableaux.\" The song, thanks in part to its video, which Priestley strongly supported and urged American networks to play, drew a notable level of attention in the U.S.[citation needed] Priestley also invited the band to play the song at the fictional night club, \"The Peach Pit After Dark\" on his series Beverly Hills, 90210. With some isolated exceptions, this was the band's first break into the American market, which continued with their next release, a live version of \"Brian Wilson\" from the ceritfied-gold album Rock Spectacle.[citation needed] The live version of \"The Old Apartment\" from that album was included on later American radio singles as a B-side option for stations.[citation needed] The studio version of the song has two main versions: the original album version and a radio mix, which was a completely new mix of the song. Notable differences in the radio mix, besides a completely new audio mix, include an 8-bar instrumental intro and in Page's noticeably filtered vocal bridge. Apple Inc. included the music video on the Mac OS 8 installation CD as a QuickTime example. Then-new band member Kevin Hearn was, as with \"Shoe Box,\" in the music video for this song even though he was not involved in the recording of the song.[citation needed] He plays an electric guitar, while Steven Page (who both played guitar and sang on the original) does not have a guitar in the video."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"Thieves in the Temple\" is a song by American musician Prince from the 1990 soundtrack album, Graffiti Bridge. Added at the last minute, it was the final song recorded for the album. \"Thieves in the Temple\" topped the US R&B chart and became a number six hit in the US, and a number seven hit in the UK. The single also peaked at number 9 on the dance charts. The track has a unique sound, starting quietly with echoed keyboards and vocals before the main section of the song booms in with a pulsating synth bass, syncopated drum machines, Middle Eastern melodies and opera-like layered vocals. Prince also samples a harmonica solo from a recording by The Chambers Brothers. The vocals are emotional, and accuse the subject of rejecting Prince and lying to him. The \"temple\" in the title recalls the ever-present spirituality in many of Prince's songs. The maxi-single contains extended lyrics that continue the theme before diverging into more dance-oriented material. The maxi-single also contains a Junior Vasquez remix called \"Thieves in the House\", which is distinctly more dance-oriented. It also contains samples from earlier Prince songs \"Eye No\" and \"Batdance\", as well as a dub version of the house track. The music video for the song was pulled from the film, but an extended video exists which mirrors the extended remix."@en ;

A fast-paced mid-tempo R&B track, the song is about a man who meets a woman who seems like a nice catch, but he decides not to enter a relationship with her because she looks too much like an ex-girlfriend with whom he had a bad breakup.

It was released at the end of 1981; a year in which Wilde had already scored three highly successful hit singles and a best-selling debut album. The single was another international success, topping the charts in France, Sweden and Switzerland and hitting the Top 10 in several other nations. In France alone it sold one million copies. It was released on the 7\" format but also as a 12\" single in Germany, although not in a remixed or extended version. The B-side of both releases was an exclusive non-album track called \"Watching For Shapes\". \"Cambodia\" was later included on Wilde's second original album, Select and was followed by a more uptempo, instrumental version of the song with the title \"Reprise\". Musically and lyrically, \"Cambodia\" showed a change in direction for Wilde from the new wave feel of her debut album. The song was mainly synth-driven, with oriental-sounding percussion."@en ;

The single was released in November 1980, in advance of the release of Sandinista!, with the anti-nuclear \"Stop the World\" as its B-side. The song opens and closes with a US Marines' marching Military cadence and is mostly about The Draft though it also deals war in general. With the line \"It's 55 minutes past 11...\" the song directly reference the Minutes to Midnight Doomsday Clock which was established and maintained by the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists at the University of Chicago, which denotes by just how few minutes it is to midnight to what the impending threat of just how close the world is estimated to be to a global disaster, and it also includes a rejection of dead-end jobs (\"who gives you work and why should you do it?\"). Though the US discontinued the draft in 1973, in 1980 Congress re-instated the requirement for men aged 18\u201325 to register with the Selective Service System. This may have inspired the song's subject matter as it was a topical subject in America during 1980, the year when Sandinista! was written and recorded. The song was recorded at Electric Lady Studios in New York. Don Letts filmed the single's accompanying video in a warehouse owned by singer and collector of military paraphernalia Chris Farlowe.

It is also her first single released in 2007. \"Chu-Lip\", marks the first time that Otsuka has released more than 3 singles before the release of an album. \"Chu-Lip\" is a play on the Japanese word for tulip, combining the sound of a kiss (\"chu\") with the English word \"lip.\" The title track of the single is used as the theme song for the TBS drama Kirakira Kenshuii, starring Manami Konishi and Eiji Wentz from WaT. The b-side of the single is \"Kimi ni Kaeru.\", which is a med-tempo song. The term kaeru can mean \"returning\" or \"frog,\" thus the title can also be translated into \"Giving You a Frog.\". Otsuka can sometimes be seen carrying a stuffed animal frog on her TV performances for \"CHU-LIP\" because of this. Otsuka also wore a frog ring at the 58th K\u014Dhaku Uta Gassen. The single debuted at #3 during its first week with 55,362 copies sold. Altogether it has sold 105,233 copies and continues to chart on Oricon.

	dbo:abstract	"\"Cosmik Debris\" is a song by American composer Frank Zappa, from his 1974 album Apostrophe ('). It concerns the Mystery Man, a typical guru or psychic, offering to help the narrator reach Nervanna [sic] for a \"nominal service charge,\" and the narrator's refusal to buy into his act, \"Look here, brother, who you jiving with that cosmik debris?\" When the Mystery Man gets pushy, Zappa as the narrator tells how he snatched the crystal ball, hypnotized the Mystery Man, stole his stuff and blew his mind. The song was popular on the Dr. Demento Show in the 70s, and in Zappa's concerts, with memorable guitar solos from Zappa, also featuring George Duke on keyboard and Napoleon Murphy Brock on sax. The song was featured in the late-2010 Dweezil Zappa Plays Zappa tour, where through the magic of video and editing (from 1970s-era shows), Frank Zappa on a large video screen both sang and played a guitar solo while the ZPZ band provided a live backing.

Released as the second single from her self-titled debut album, the single went to number two for three weeks on the Billboard Hot 100 singles chart in late April and early May 1990, kept out of the top spot by Sin\u00E9ad O'Connor's ballad \"'Nothing Compares 2 U\". In addition, a \"new jack swing\" remix of the song was produced by Teddy Riley and reached number six on the R&B chart, and number eleven on the dance chart. Shep Pettibone also remixed the single, but was only released to DJ's. When released around Europe it also became successful albeit more modestly. In the UK, the single stalled at #22 after Child refused to appear on the popular British TV program Top of the Pops while the single was climbing the charts, considering the program to be a \"sellout\". In April 1990, the single was certified gold by the RIAA. It is Child's best known song and only top 40 hit, making her a one hit wonder in the public eye.

	dbo:abstract	"\"I Want Out\" is a song by the German power metal band Helloween from the album Keeper of the Seven Keys, Pt. 2, that was released as a single in 1988. It was written by Kai Hansen, who said in an interview that it was a hint of him really wanting \"out\" of the band. Musically, the song is characterised by a recognisable introduction and Michael Kiske's trademark high pitched singing in the chorus. It is also punk-influenced (especially the rebellious lyrics) in contrast to other Helloween songs, or Hansen's post-Helloween work. It is one of the Helloween's most recognizable songs, and is often performed live by Helloween and both Hansen's and Kiske's current bands Gamma Ray and Unisonic. The song was covered by HammerFall, Sonata Arctica, Avalanch and Skylark."@en .

	dbo:abstract	"\"Pearl's a Singer\" is a song made famous by the British singer Elkie Brooks, as taken from her 1977 album Two Days Away which was produced by the song's co-writers Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller. The original version of \"Pearl's a Singer\" had been introduced by the duo Dino and Sembello - also the song's co-writers - on their 1974 self-titled album which Leiber and Stoller had produced. The song is a ballad, telling the story of a failed singer who still dreams of the success she might have had. \"Pearl's a Singer\" afforded Elkie Brooks her debut chart single - thirteen years after she'd recorded her first track - reaching #8 in the UK Singles Chart in spring 1977. It remained her highest placing in that chart until \"No More the Fool\" reached #5, early in 1987. Brooks would recall that at a rehearsal session for her Two Days Away album \"Jerry Leiber [said]: 'I want to play you this song, I don't think you're going to like it, it's too countryish for you but I'll play it for you anyway.'I said: 'Go on, I've got an open mind, I like a lot of country [music].' I listened to 'Pearl's a Singer' and told [Leiber & Stoller] I liked it but that they needed to [modify it with] a middle section. To which Jerry said: 'No problem'. And with that he disappeared and came back half an hour later with the [modified] version of 'Pearl's a Singer'\" which Brooks recorded. Brooks - \"To be honest [in the mid-1970s] I just wanted to enjoy myself in music and I never thought 'Pearl' was going to be a big hit but [after] it was released on my birthday in 1977 the record company really pushed it, [it] got played on all the radio stations and became very successful. No one was more surprised than me.\" \"Pearl's a Singer\" has also been recorded by Bernadette Peters (album Bernadette/ 1980), by Viktor Lazlo (album My Delicious Poisons/ 1991), and by Annie Schilder (nl) (album Anny En Ik/ 2007). The Czech rendering \"\u010Cern\u00FD Zp\u011Bv\u00E1k\" was recorded by Jana Kratochv\u00EDlov\u00E1 (cs) in 1978; the German rendering \"Tingel-Tangel \" was recorded by Wencke Myhre for her 1979 album So bin ich; the Swiss German rendering \"Pearl tuet singe\" was recorded by Toni Vescoli (als) for his 1999 album Tegsass. \"Pearl's a Singer\" is featured in the score of the Leiber & Stoller musical revue Smokey Joe's Cafe.

	dbo:abstract	"\"Sexy Music\" is a 1981 single taken from Irish female vocal group The Nolans' 1980 album Making Waves, and later translated into Japanese by Japanese idol duo Wink. The Nolans' version was released as a single in Japan in April 1981 after winning the Tokyo Music Festival a few days prior to this. It was cut from the album exclusively in Japan to be released as a 7-inch single and a LP containing rearrangements of tracks from Making Waves and Nolan Sisters, gaining commercial success with about 270,000 copies sold. In 1981, the song was covered by Taiwanese singer Frankie Kao (\u9AD8\u51CC\u98CE) as \u51AC\u5929\u91CC\u7684\u4E00\u628A\u706B, which was later covered, with much more success, by fellow Taiwanese singer Fei Xiang. Having had some success prior, he reached superstar status almost overnight when in 1987, he performed this song in CCTV's new year gala. The song became an instant hit, and his subseqeuent album sold 2 million copies. In 1990, Wink recorded the cover version sung in the Japanese lyrics written by Neko Oikawa. Their interpretation was released as a single in March 1990 and provided the duo with their fifth and last number-one spot on the Japanese hit parade. In 1991, The Nolans would in turn cover Wink's biggest selling single, \u6DCB\u3057\u3044\u71B1\u5E2F\u9B5A Samishii Nettaigyo, with English lyrics, under the name Tidal Wave."@en ;

It's quite funny, because we did this gig in Los Angeles and Frankie Knuckles played this track at the party afterwards. Neil came over and said, 'Why don't we make records like this?' I said, 'Neil, it is us.' So that's how much we know about dance music!\" The video was directed by Eric Watson and filmed in Newcastle and North Tyneside. Filming locations included the Bigg Market, Newcastle Quayside, Railway Terrace in Wallsend, Byker, Whitley Bay and the Tyne and Wear Metro. The black and white video co-stars Paul Gascoigne's sister Anna Gascoigne.

The song was the second UK single released from the album, on 11 June 2007. A North American release followed in July 2007. \"Sunday Girl\" is a very uptempo electronic music song which tells the story of someone who has immersed herself in nightlife and while in a nightclub catches the attention of Bell, who offers to dance with her \"'til Sunday morning\" but warns \"don't you mess your life up, Sunday Girl\". The introduction is very similar to the bridge of the duo's 1995 single \"Fingers & Thumbs (Cold Summer's Day)\". An unofficial music video of the song was featured on Erasure's official website, consisting of backstage scenes and live performances from their Light at the End of the World world tour.

The album Re-Entry was originally due for release in early 2005 but due to the underperformance of \"Yours Fatally\" and due to their record company dropping them, the album was not released until 9 April 2007, however it was decided that this song would still be included on the album. The single became Big Brovaz' seventh UK hit but their third consecutive single to miss the top ten, peaking at number 15. Because \"Yours Fatally\" was the first single from their second album, it was viewed to have underperformed considerably. It did, however, outpeak the previous single \"We Wanna Thank You (The Things You Do)\". The single was not released outside the UK. \"Yours Fatally\" was the final single released with group member Dion, who decided not to re-join the group after their hiatus after they were dropped from Epic Records; however, her vocals were left on the version of \"Yours Fatally\" released on Re-Entry."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"Seven Wonders\" is a song by Fleetwood Mac. It was released as the second single from the band's 1987 album Tango in the Night. Stevie Nicks performed the lead vocals on this song, which was written by Sandy Stewart with contributed lyrics by Stevie Nicks. While listening to the demo by Stewart (who did not provide any written lyrics), Nicks misunderstood the phrase \"All the way down you held the line\" as \"All the way down to Emmeline\", which is what she sang. Nicks also added an ambiguous word, sounding like \"Sara\" or \"Tara\", during the breaks between choruses and verses. (The word may refer to Nicks' song \"Sara\", on Fleetwood Mac's 1979 album Tusk, or even to another Nicks composition on Tango in the Night, \"Welcome to the Room... Sara\"; the lyrics to the latter song include references to Scarlett O'Hara and Tara, and Nicks has used the name \"Sara\" several times in the past as a pseudonym for herself.) Some fans have also speculated that she may be saying \"Aaron\" rather than \"Sara\" or \"Tara.\" The title of the demo by Sandy Stewart was reportedly called \"Aaron.\" These additions as well as various other changes to the lyrics, led to Nicks' credit as co-writer of the song. The song was also released as a 12-inch single, which included an extended remix, a dub mix, and an instrumental, \"Book of Miracles\", which later became the track \"Juliet\" on Nicks' 1989 album The Other Side of the Mirror. A limited edition 12-inch picture disc version was also released in the UK."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"Your Love Is My Drug\" is a song by American singer-songwriter Kesha, taken from her debut studio album, Animal (2010). It was released as the album's third single on May 14, 2010. The song was written by Kesha and Pebe Sebert, with Ammo, who co-produced the song with Dr. Luke and Benny Blanco. \"Your Love Is My Drug\"'s initial writing took place during a plane ride. Kesha stated the song had a carefree message and was not meant to be taken too seriously. The song's inspiration came from Kesha and her ex-boyfriend; it is about their psychotic relationship with their love for one another being compared to a drug. According to Kesha, the song sounds happy but also contains a dark undertone, of an obsession for someone and is about being heartbroken. Critical reception of the song has been generally positive. Critics complimented the hook but had mixed reactions with the chorus. Some praised Kesha for knowing her way around a strong pop chorus, while others called it predictable and dull. Prior to the release of Animal, the song charted in the United States, the United Kingdom, and Canada. After being released as a single the song reached the top five in Australia and the United States, as well as reaching the top ten in Canada. It has gone on to sell over three million copies in the US alone. Kesha performed the song alongside \"Tik Tok\" on the 35th season of Saturday Night Live where she was covered in glow in the dark tribal-like make-up. In the music video, Kesha is portrayed in the desert while being chased around by her love interest. The main idea behind the video is being so in love with someone that you lose your head, comparable to love being a drug. The video features a digital animation sequence which was inspired by The Beatles' Yellow Submarine."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"Si j'avais au moins...\" (English: \"If I Had at Least...\") is a song recorded by French singer Myl\u00E8ne Farmer. This pop rock ballad was written by Farmer with music composed by Laurent Boutonnat. It was the third single released, from her seventh studio album Point de suture (2008), on 16 February 2009. Directed by Bruno Aveillan, the accompanying music video is the continuation of Farmer's previous single \"D\u00E9g\u00E9n\u00E9ration\" and is the last part of a short film called The Farmer Project, broadcast in January 2009. In the video, the singer portrays a supernatural character who saves animals from testing and heals them. Although a survey showed that a minority of the voters wanted the song as the third single, \"Si j'avais au moins...\" received positive reviews and achieved some success on the French Singles Chart, debuting at number-one. Farmer performed the song on television during the NRJ Music Awards show on 17 January 2009 and on the 2009 Myl\u00E8ne Farmer en tourn\u00E9e tour."@en ;

dbr:A_Love_She_Can_Count_On	rdf:type	dbo:MusicalWork ;
	dbo:abstract	"\"A Love She Can Count On\" (Tamla 54078) was a 1963 hit single by Motown Records R&B group The Miracles, issued on that label's Tamla subsidiary label. It was taken from their album The Fabulous Miracles, and was the follow-up to the group's million-selling Grammy Hall of Fame inducted tune, \"You've Really Got A Hold On Me\".The first of three singles released by The Miracles that year, this song was a Billboard Top 40 Pop Hit, peaking at #31, and missed the Top 20 of its R&B chart by only one position, peaking at # 21.Written and produced by Miracles lead singer Smokey Robinson, \"A Love She Can Count On\" features the same bluesy sound and feel of \"Hold On Me\", featuring the gospel-inspired harmonies of Miracles members Bobby Rogers, Claudette Robinson, Pete Moore, and the late Ronnie White, and, like that previous song, begins with the guitar of Miracles member Marv Tarplin.However, that is where the similarities end; unlike the previous hit, with its theme of being in love with someone you don't like, \"A Love She Can Count On\" has as its theme undying love and loyalty, with Robinson, as the song's narrator, promising eternal love and devotion: The other Miracles participate in a sing-along call and response with Smokey on the song's bridge, similar to the song that, according to Smokey, inspired both this song and \"Hold On Me\", Sam Cooke's 1962 hit \"Bring It On Home to Me\". The single and album versions of this song are noticeably different, the album version of \"A Love She Can Count On\" featuring a bluesy piano style as was done by its predecessor \"You've Really Got A Hold On Me\". For the most part the piano was deleted from the single version, not being featured as prominently.Unlike almost all other singles from The Miracles, and indeed many other songs by the group, \"A Love She Can Count On\" has not yet been covered by major acts. This was also the case with the B-side of the single, \"I Can Take A Hint\", despite the fact that it was also a chart hit, reaching # 107 on the Billboard Pop chart. \"A Love She Can Count On\" appears on several Miracles \"Greatest Hits\" collections, including their album Greatest Hits from the Beginning, and their 2009 two-CD set, The Miracles\u2013Depend On Me: The Early Albums (which features both live and studio versions). The Miracles also performed a special extended version of the song on their first live album, 1963's The Miracles Recorded Live on Stage."@en ;
