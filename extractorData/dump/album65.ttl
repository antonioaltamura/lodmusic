The album drew upon the production talents of Mike Knott and Gene Eugene. On this release the band has a rockabilly sound, somewhere between the Stray Cats and The Reverend Horton Heat, or \"like a rockabilly version of Mike Knott...\" Lyrically the album addressed hard issues such as racism (\"Skin\"), the underground church in China (\"People Underground\"), materialism and temptation (\"Fat Cat\"), New Age spiritualism (\"Rock 'n' Roll & My Baby\"), and internal spiritual battles with our sinful nature. In \"Spiritual Heroin\" Russinger deals with his own former speed addiction, describing how Christ can fill the need created by addictions, which one reviewer described as a \"slightly disturbing metaphor.\" The album also deals with the victims of the holocaust (\"Death Train\"), and finally closes with \"Let's Go\", a \"no holds barred celebration of salvation.\" One reviewer found the album to be on various tracks \"clich\u00E9-ridden but vaguely worshipful\", \"weakly inspiring\", and \"shallow & dumb.\" The reviewer went on to state that the attempt \"to bring 1950s wholesomeness into today's moral morass\" fell flat."@en ;

It was recorded at the Philharmonic Hall, New York City, in October 1972, and is a noted example of the two Hindustani classical musicians' celebrated jugalbandi (duet) style of playing. With accompaniment from tabla player Alla Rakha, the performance reflects the two artists' sorrow at the recent death of their revered guru, and Khan's father, Allauddin Khan. The latter was responsible for many innovations in Indian music during the twentieth century, including the call-and-response dialogue that musicians such as Shankar, Khan and Rakha popularised among Western audiences in the 1960s. The album features three ragas, including \"Raga Sindhi Bhairavi\", which Ali Akbar Khan had previously interpreted on his landmark recording Music of India (1955). In Concert 1972 has received critical acclaim; Ken Hunt of Gramophone magazine describes it as a \"sometimes smouldering, sometimes fiery, masterpiece\" and \"the living, fire-breathing embodiment of one of the greatest partnerships ever forged in Hindustani [classical music]\". Produced by George Harrison, Zakir Hussain and Phil McDonald, the album was the final Shankar-related release on the Beatles' Apple label, following his and Harrison's work together on Raga and The Concert for Bangladesh. Apple reissued In Concert in 1996 and 2004, reuniting the 50-minute \"Raga Manj Khamaj\", which had previously been split over two LP sides."@en ;

After attaining international success in 2001 with her first English record, Border, Downs wanted to release a fifth Spanish-English language project as its followup. In the vein of her earlier work, the album is heavily influenced by latin pop, world music, flamenco and rock. Downs enlisted Paul Cohen as executive producer, also working with Celso Duarte, Brian Lynch and Aneiro Ta\u00F1o. At its release Shake Away received generally favorable reviews from music critics, who complimented Lila's evolution from her earlier work. The album debuted at number 36 on the US Billboard Top Latin Albums, with first-week sales of 30,000 copies. Internationally, the album topped the charts in Argentina, Germany, Mexico and Spain. Shake Away was nominated at Best Contemporary World Music Album at the 2009 Grammy Awards, and the Top World Music Majors at the WOMEX Awards. Five singles were released to promote the album. Although its lead single (\"Ojo de Culebra\") was the only track to reach the US Billboard Hot 100, the follow-up singles \"Perro Negro\", \"Yo Envidio el Viento\", \"Tierra de Luz\" and \"Black Magic Woman\" enjoyed moderate success on the Hot Latin Songs, World Music Songs and Latin Pop Airplay charts. The projects were promoted with the Ojo de Culebra Tour in 2009 and 2010, which visited the Americas, Asia and Europe."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Box Car Racer is the only studio album by American rock band Box Car Racer. Produced by Jerry Finn, the album was released May 21, 2002 through MCA Records. The band was essentially a side-project of Blink-182 members Tom DeLonge and Travis Barker, with David Kennedy completing the band\u2019s studio lineup; a bassist and friend of Kennedy, Anthony Celestino, toured with the band throughout late 2002. The record was the only studio effort the trio produced together, and was recorded over the course of six weeks during the winter of 2001. The record is primarily based on DeLonge's post-hardcore influences, such as Fugazi and Refused. The sessions were particularly difficult for DeLonge, who had previously undergone back surgery. Blink-182 bassist Mark Hoppus by all accounts felt betrayed over his lack of inclusion on the project, which evolved into tensions between the two. The record is a concept album detailing the end of the world, and features dark, moody tracks mulling over confusion. The album peaked at number twelve on the Billboard 200, and the two singles \"I Feel So\" and \"There Is\" charted on the U.S. Modern Rock Tracks. Despite receiving positive reviews on release, this is the only album from Box Car Racer, with Delonge having stated that the band \"served its purpose and is now defunct.\" The album has been certified gold in Canada."@en ;

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Buddha_(album)>	rdf:type	schema:MusicAlbum ;
	dbo:abstract	"Buddha is the third demo by the American rock band Blink-182. Recorded and released in January 1994 under the name Blink, it was the band's first recording to be sold and distributed. Blink-182 was formed in Poway, California, a suburb outside of San Diego, in August 1992. Guitarist Tom DeLonge and Mark Hoppus were introduced to one another by Hoppus' sister. The duo recruited drummer Scott Raynor and began to practice together in his bedroom, spending hours together writing music, attending punk shows and movies and playing practical jokes. The band had recorded two previous demos in Raynor's bedroom \u2014 Flyswatter and Demo No.2 \u2014 using a four track recorder. Most of the tracks from the demo were re-recorded for their debut album Cheshire Cat. Pat Secor, Hoppus' boss at music store The Wherehouse, was attempting to start his own record label, named Filter Records. Secor pulled money from his savings and helped finance and produce the demo recording. Buddha was recorded live at local Santee studio Doubletime, compiling a collection that represented nearly all of the songs the band had written up to that point. Hoppus and friends Cam Jones and Kerry Key created the cassette artwork, and the original cassette packaging was compiled by the band and Hoppus' family. Locally distributed to several San Diego record stores and available for purchase at early concerts, Buddha helped the trio cement an audience and was a deciding factor in their signing to local label Cargo in 1993. The recording became the subject of a legal dispute between the band and Secor in later years. The band accused Secor of selling the tape without paying royalties, and attempted to put a stop to his distribution with help of lawyer Joe Escalante of The Vandals, who also owned independent record label Kung Fu Records. Kung Fu digitally remixed and remastered the demo and commercially re-released it in October 1998, deleting two original tracks for other recordings from the original session. Kung Fu has since reportedly sold 300,000 copies of Buddha. It is currently the only commercially available demo by Blink-182."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Crystal Ball is the sixth album by Styx, released in 1976. This album marked the recording debut of new guitarist Tommy Shaw. The track \"Mademoiselle\" was Tommy Shaw's vocal debut and the album's Top-40 hit. The album's title track would become a concert staple for the band, as it was performed on every subsequent Styx tour with which Shaw was involved. \"Shooz\" was co-written by Shaw and James \"J.Y.\" Young. The bluesy rocker had Shaw on slide guitar while Young contributed a Hendrix-like solo to the middle of the track after Shaw's slide solo. \"This Old Man\" is a song that DeYoung wrote for his father and the impact his dad had on his life. Debussy's classical piece \"Clair De Lune\" served as the intro to the album's closing track, \"Ballerina.\" The version of \"Clair De Lune\" on Crystal Ball just had DeYoung on piano and changed the key from D flat to C as the next track (\"Ballerina\") started in C minor. Although the album stalled at #66 upon its 1976 release, it would go platinum in 1978 after the success of the next album, The Grand Illusion."@en ;

Recorded at Big Fish Studios in Encinitas, California with producer Mark Trombino, the album was released in the United States on June 17, 1997, jointly through independent label Cargo Music and major label MCA Records. MCA signed the band in 1996 following moderate sales of their debut Cheshire Cat (1995) and growing popularity of the trio in Australia. Dude Ranch was the band's final recording released on Cargo and their last with original drummer Scott Raynor before he was dismissed from the band in 1998. The band recorded the album during the winter of 1996\u20131997. With lyrical material written on the band's nonstop tours over the previous years, as well as completed songs, the band recorded with Trombino in sessions that lasted for five weeks. During the production for Dude Ranch, the members of Blink-182 were plagued with difficulties only made worse by the rushed schedule: bassist Mark Hoppus and guitarist Tom DeLonge, co-vocalists for the band, were having vocal problems and Raynor had to record his drum tracks with both heels broken, on crutches. Promoted by lead single \"Dammit (Growing Up)\", the record was released in the summer of 1997 and was a success. \"Dammit\" became a rock radio hit single and helped the band gain mainstream credibility as they toured worldwide on the Vans Warped Tour. The band toured exhaustively behind the album, creating tensions which led to the firing of Raynor in mid-1998. Three more singles were released, with \"Josie (Everything's Gonna Be Fine)\" gathering MTV play and charting highly in Australia. Dude Ranch eventually grew in sales and was certified platinum in the US by the end of the decade."@en ;

The album was the band's first release for A&M Records (with whom they signed earlier in 1975, after the unexpected success of the single \"Lady\"). The album also marked the final appearance of original Styx guitarist John Curulewski who left the band abruptly following the release of Equinox. The band went into a frantic search to find a replacement for their upcoming tour to support Equinox. Soon after, they found Tommy Shaw. The album's biggest hit was the track \"Lorelei\", which was Styx's second US Top 30 hit. Another well-known song in the album was \"Suite Madame Blue\" (the title of which has a play on the word \"sweet\" to refer to the musical term of \"suites\", i.e. unrelated instrumental successions) which was written about the upcoming Bicentennial of the US. The track became a staple for all Styx tours with Dennis DeYoung. It's a rare example of a Styx song that (briefly) requires four voice parts; during the Return to Paradise tour, the \"America\" bridge would be sung by DeYoung, Shaw, James Young and the usually silent Chuck Panozzo. Although Equinox stalled at #58, it went Gold in 1977 shortly before the release of The Grand Illusion."@en ;

Like the band's previous album, The Grand Illusion, it managed to achieve triple-platinum certification, thanks to the hit singles \"Sing for the Day\", \"Blue Collar Man (Long Nights)\" and \"Renegade\". The band members produced and recorded the album (like their previous three efforts) at Paragon Studios in Chicago with recording engineer Barry Mraz and mixing engineer Rob Kingsland. \"I'm O.K.\" was recorded at Paragon and St. James Cathedral. This would be the last album to be produced at Paragon Studios. Some consider the album to be Styx' second concept album, The Serpent Is Rising arguably being the first, as well as the last Styx album with significant progressive rock leanings that characterized their previous albums. The theme of the album, as Dennis DeYoung explained on In the Studio with Redbeard which devoted an entire episode to Pieces of Eight, was about \"not giving up your dreams just for the pursuit of money and material possessions\". Two of the album's ten tracks are instrumentals: the DeYoung synthesizer showcase \"The Message\" and Tommy Shaw's closing \"Aku-Aku\" (although for the latter, there was one lyric spoken, the title of the song). \"The Message\" serves as a prelude for \"Lords of the Ring\", and \"Aku-Aku\" is a postlude for \"Pieces of Eight\". The album's cover was done by Hipgnosis. DeYoung stated in the same 1991 interview with Redbeard on the \"In the Studio\" episode that he initially hated the cover but grew to like it as he got older."@en ;

Recorded in Ferndale, Michigan following Eminem's recruitment by Dr. Dre and Jimmy Iovine, the album features production from Dr. Dre, the Bass Brothers, and Eminem himself. The majority of the record's lyrical content is written from the perspective of the rapper's alter ego Slim Shady, whom the rapper created on Slim Shady EP (1997). The lyrics are noted for their over-the-top depictions of violence and heavy use of profanity. The album was met with both critical and commercial success; critics praised Eminem for his unique lyrical style, and the record debuted at number two on the US Billboard 200 chart behind TLC's FanMail with 283,000 copies sold in its opening week. The first official single, \"Just Don't Give a Fuck\", did not enter the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 but at least did enter the \"Bubbling Under\" Hot 100, peaking at number 14, which is equivalent to 114. The second official single, \"My Name Is\", peaked at number 36 on the Billboard Hot 100, becoming his first entry on that chart. The Slim Shady LP went on to be certified quadruple-platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). The record won a Grammy Award for Best Rap Album, and in 2012, the album was ranked number 275 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time. The Slim Shady LP turned Eminem from an unknown rapper into a high-profile celebrity. Interscope Records awarded him with his own record label, Shady Records, and he embarked on an extensive touring schedule to promote the album. In the summer of 1999, the rapper frequently performed on the Vans Warped Tour and in hip-hop clubs. He also became a highly controversial figure due to his lyrical content, which some perceived to be misogynistic and a negative influence on American youth."@en ;

Rancid's popularity and catchy songs made them the subject of a major label bidding war (hence the title, ...And Out Come the Wolves taken from a poem in Jim Carroll's The Basketball Diaries) that ended with the band staying on Epitaph. With a sound heavily influenced by ska, which called to mind Tim Armstrong and Matt Freeman's past in Operation Ivy, Rancid became one of the few bands of the mid-to late-1990s boom in punk rock to retain much of its original fanbase. In terms of record sales and certifications, \u2026And Out Come the Wolves is a popular album in the United States. It produced three hit singles: \"Roots Radicals\", \"Time Bomb\" and \"Ruby Soho\", that earned Rancid its heaviest airplay on MTV and radio stations to date. All the singles charted on Modern Rock Tracks. \u2026And Out Come the Wolves was certified gold by the RIAA on January 22, 1996. It was certified platinum on September 23, 2004. Along with Bad Religion's Stranger than Fiction, Green Day's Dookie and The Offspring's Smash, ...And Out Come the Wolves helped revive mainstream popular interest in punk rock in the mid-1990s, signaled the initial rise of mainstream punk rock, and proved to be a massive success for the band, making them possibly the most popular American punk rock band to be signed onto an independent record label.[citation needed] Since 2004, the album has continued to sell millions of digital copies.[citation needed] To coincide with its 20th anniversary, Rancid performed the album live in its entirety on their 2015-2016 Honor Is All We Know world tour."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"1977 is the first official album by Ash, released in May 1996 in the United Kingdom and Ireland, and the following month in the US. The punk rock influenced album proved popular in the UK and Ireland, and to a lesser degree elsewhere, where Britpop was a smaller cult phenomenon. It is ranked at 417 on the NME list of the Greatest albums of all time The title refers to a year of three events that shaped the band: the births of two of the band-members; the year the first punk albums were released (especially Damned Damned Damned and Never Mind the Bollocks, Here's the Sex Pistols); and the release of Star Wars. The album opens with the sound of a TIE fighter, and ends with the track \"Darkside Lightside\", the title of which is a Star Wars reference, and which climaxes with a choral version of the Star Wars theme. The band also covered \"Cantina Band\", as the b-side to the \"Girl From Mars\" single. Jackie Chan is celebrated in the lyrics of \"Kung Fu\", and used the song for the end credits of his movie Rumble in the Bronx. The song \"Lose Control\" was featured in the game Gran Turismo, the first time one of the band's songs was used in a videogame (it was later followed by \"Burn Baby Burn\" from the album Free All Angels, featured in Tiger Woods PGA Tour 2003, and by \"Orpheus\" from the album Meltdown, featured in Burnout 3: Takedown). The first 50,000 pressings of the CD feature the original version of \"Jack Names the Planets\" and its b-side \"Don't Know\" (February 1994), hidden in the album's pregap: they are accessed by 'rewinding' from track one. There is also a hidden track of band members vomiting in a non-musical tape recording named, \"Sick Party\", which appears after \"Darkside Lightside\" on all versions. \"Sick Party\" was included in Pitchfork Media's 2010 list of \"ten unusual CD-era gimmicks\". In 2008 Tim Wheeler remembered:Several music magazines placed the album in their end-of-year lists for 1996, including NME, Melody Maker, Q, Select and Kerrang. It is also included in the book 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die. The album is currently certified Platinum by the BPI and, according to the biography on the official site, has sold over two million copies around the world. Ash played the album in its entirety at London Roundhouse on September 5, 2008. Following the huge demand and speed of which the Roundhouse show sold out, they also added a show at London Astoria for the following day, Saturday 6 September 2008. A three-disc collector's edition of the album was released on November 3, 2008.

	dbo:abstract	"3 Feet High and Rising is the debut studio album from the American hip hop trio De La Soul, released March 14, 1989. It marked the first of three full-length collaborations with producer Prince Paul, which would become the critical and commercial peak of both parties. It is consistently placed on 'greatest albums' lists by noted music critics and publications. Robert Christgau called the record \"unlike any rap album you or anybody else has ever heard.\" In 1998, the album was selected as one of The Source Magazine's 100 Best Rap Albums. A critical, as well as commercial, success, the album contains the singles, \"Me Myself and I\", \"The Magic Number\", \"Buddy\", and \"Eye Know\". In 2001, the album was re-issued along with an extra disc of B-side tracks, and alternative versions. The album title came from the Johnny Cash song \"Five Feet High and Rising\". It was selected by the Library of Congress as a 2010 addition to the National Recording Registry, which selects recordings annually that are culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"August is the tenth studio album by English blues rock singer Eric Clapton, released in 1986. Primarily produced byPhil Collins, in association with longtime Clapton associate Tom Dowd, it became Clapton's biggest-selling LP to date. Among the songs are the Dowd/Clapton-produced signature tune \"It's in the Way That You Use It\" (co-written with Robbie Robertson, and featured in the Paul Newman-Tom Cruise film The Color of Money in October 1986, a month before the album's release, subsequently reaching No. 1 on the Mainstream Rock Tracks chart for one week) and three Collins-produced numbers\u2014the up-tempo, horn-laden \"Run\" and the guitar-laden rockers \"Tearing Us Apart\" (with Tina Turner), \"Holy Mother\", a tribute to Richard Manuel of The Band, and \"Miss You.\" \"It's in the Way That You Use It\" would later win the prestigious MAGIS award for Clapton from the SGFC Ministry of Multimedia (SGFCMoM). The album's only UK top 20 hit, \"Behind the Mask\", was recorded at the suggestion of Greg Phillinganes. Legend has it that upon hearing Yellow Magic Orchestra's original track, around 1980\u201382, producer Quincy Jones fell in love with the track, and he and Michael Jackson recorded their own version with new lyrics by Jackson during his Thriller sessions. The track never made the Thriller album but Phillinganes, at the time keyboard player for Jackson, later released his own version of the song on his 1984 Pulse album, which resembles the Clapton version that became August's lead single in the UK. Jackson's version was finally released in 2010 on the posthumous album Michael. Clapton's studio band for the album included drummer/vocalist Collins; bassist Nathan East and keyboard player Greg Phillinganes; saxophonist Michael Brecker, trumpeters Randy Brecker and Jon Faddis, and trombone player Dave Bargeron. Veering between Collins soul/pop and Clapton blues/rock, August cemented Clapton's comeback. Clapton, drummer/vocalist Collins, bassist East and keyboard player Phillinganes would recreate their studio roles for Clapton's acclaimed live appearances over the next two years."@en ;

Produced by Robert John \"Mutt\" Lange, the album was released on 25 July 1980 by Albert Productions and Atlantic Records. By the late 1970s, AC/DC began to achieve significant popularity outside their native Australia, with high-energy live performances and a string of successful albums. In 1979, they paired with producer Lange and recorded their international breakthrough, Highway to Hell. Shortly before the recording of their follow-up, lead vocalist Bon Scott died after a night of heavy alcohol consumption. The group continued on with ex-Geordie singer Brian Johnson. Back in Black was recorded over seven weeks in the Bahamas in spring 1980. The area was hit by tropical storms at the time, making the sessions difficult at times. Johnson penned the album's lyrics and melodies, while guitarists Angus and Malcolm Young composed the music. Its musical content consists of hard rock-styled numbers with lyrics relating to sex, alcohol, partying and rock and roll. Lange demanded perfection in the band's recordings, particularly on Johnson's vocals. Following its completion, the group mixed Back in Black at Electric Lady Studios in New York City. The album's all-black cover was designed as a \"sign of mourning\" for Scott. Their sixth international release, Back in Black was an unprecedented success: it has sold an estimated 50 million copies worldwide. Its enormous sales figures have made it the second-highest-selling album in history. The band supported the album with a yearlong world tour, cementing them among the most popular music acts of the early 1980s. Back in Black received positive critical reception at the time of its release, and it has since been included on numerous lists of \"greatest\" albums. Since its initial release, the album has been reissued and remastered multiple times, most recently for digital distribution."@en .

Recording sessions began in New York in October 1965 with numerous backing musicians, including members of Dylan's live backing band, the Hawks. Though sessions continued until January 1966, they yielded only one track that made it onto the final album \u2014 \"One of Us Must Know (Sooner or Later)\". At producer Bob Johnston's suggestion, Dylan, keyboardist Al Kooper, and guitarist Robbie Robertson moved to the CBS studios in Nashville, Tennessee. These sessions, augmented by some of Nashville's top session musicians, were more fruitful, and in February and March all the remaining songs for the album were recorded. Blonde on Blonde completed the trilogy of rock albums that Dylan recorded in 1965 and 1966, starting with Bringing It All Back Home and Highway 61 Revisited. Critics often rank Blonde on Blonde as one of the greatest albums of all time. Combining the expertise of Nashville session musicians with a modernist literary sensibility, the album's songs have been described as operating on a grand scale musically, while featuring lyrics one critic called \"a unique blend of the visionary and the colloquial\". It was one of the first double albums in rock music. The album peaked at No. 9 on the Billboard 200 chart in the U.S., where it eventually went double-platinum, and reached No. 3 in the UK. Blonde on Blonde spawned two singles that were top twenty hits in the U.S.: \"Rainy Day Women #12 & 35\" and \"I Want You\". Two additional songs, \"Just Like a Woman\" and \"Visions of Johanna\", have been named as among Dylan's greatest compositions and were featured in Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Songs of All Time list.

The musical styles of Blood Sugar Sex Magik differed notably from the techniques employed on the Chili Peppers' preceding album, Mother's Milk, and featured little use of heavy metal guitar riffs. The album's subject matter incorporated sexual innuendos and references to drugs and death as well as themes of lust and exuberance.

It began as a series of concert performances which were later adapted for a 2005 direct-to-video concert film of the same name. The album received great acclaim and earned Wilson his first Grammy Award, later being featured in several \"greatest albums\" lists. The project was originally conceptualized in 1966 as Smile, a studio album recorded by the Beach Boys and written in collaboration between Wilson and lyricist Van Dyke Parks. It was intended to succeed the group's album Pet Sounds and was based on the engineering methods of their single \"Good Vibrations\". Many years after the project was shelved due to personal and technical difficulties with recording, Wilson chose to revisit the material with Parks as a specially arranged live concert performance. Motivated by the unexpected positive reception, a studio-recorded version was then released by Wilson as a solo album.

	dbo:abstract	"Bringing It All Back Home is the fifth studio album by American singer-songwriter Bob Dylan, released on March 22, 1965 by Columbia Records. The album is divided into an electric and an acoustic side. On side one of the original LP, Dylan is backed by an electric rock and roll band\u2014a move that further alienated him from some of his former peers in the folk song community. Likewise, on the acoustic second side of the album, he distanced himself from the protest songs with which he had become closely identified (such as \"Blowin' in the Wind\" and \"A Hard Rain's a-Gonna Fall\"), as his lyrics continued their trend towards the abstract and personal. The album reached No. 6 on Billboard's Pop Albums chart, the first of Dylan's LPs to break into the US top 10. It also topped the UK charts later that Spring. The first track, \"Subterranean Homesick Blues\", became Dylan's first single to chart in the US, peaking at #39."@en ;

After touring and recording in the United Kingdom with Johnny Nash, Nash's departure to the United States left the band without enough money to return home; they approached producer Chris Blackwell, who agreed to advance the Wailers money for an album and paid their fares back to Jamaica, where they recorded Catch a Fire. The album features nine songs, two of which were written by Peter Tosh and the rest by Bob Marley. After Marley's return to London to present the tapes to Blackwell, the producer reworked the tracks with contributions by Muscle Shoals session musician Wayne Perkins, who played guitar on two overdubbed tracks. The album's supporting concert tour throughout England and the United States helped establish the band as international stars. Catch a Fire peaked at number 171 and number 51 on Billboard's 200 and Black Albums charts, respectively. The album has received critical acclaim, including being listed at number 126 on Rolling Stone's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time, the second highest placement of the five Bob Marley albums on the list, after the posthumous compilation album Legend.

Although the album did not produce high-charting singles it nevertheless remained on the charts for 97 weeks. A steady seller in Springsteen's catalogue, it has been certified triple-platinum by the RIAA. Although slightly less enthusiastic than those for Springsteen's previous album Born to Run, reviews for Darkness on the Edge of Town were unanimously positive. Critics notably praised the maturity of the album's themes and lyrics. It remains one of Springsteen's most highly regarded records by both fans and critics and several of its songs have become staples of the singer's live performances. In September 2010, a documentary film chronicling the making of Darkness was first shown at the Toronto International Film Festival. Quoting Springsteen as saying \u201CMore than rich, more than famous, more than happy \u2013 I wanted to be great\u201D, reviewer Stephen Whitty of the Newark Star-Ledger commented: \"For many fans, that long journey pulled onto the Turnpike here.\" In 2003, Rolling Stone Magazine ranked it at 151 on their list of the greatest albums of all time."@en ;

The record marks a return to the introspective and gloomy gothic rock style the band had established in the early 1980s. As he neared the age of thirty, vocalist and guitarist Robert Smith had felt an increased pressure to follow up on the group's pop successes with a more enduring work. This, coupled with a distaste for the group's newfound popularity, caused Smith to lapse back into the use of hallucinogenic drugs, the effects of which had a strong influence on the production of the album. The Cure recorded Disintegration at Hookend Recording Studios in Checkendon, Oxfordshire, with co-producer David M. Allen from late 1988 to early 1989. During production, founding member Lol Tolhurst was fired from the band. Disintegration became the band's commercial peak, charting at number three in the United Kingdom and at number twelve in the United States, and producing several hit singles including \"Lovesong\", which peaked at number two on the Billboard Hot 100. It remains The Cure's highest selling record to date, with more than three million copies sold worldwide. It was greeted with a warm critical reception before later being acclaimed, eventually being placed at number 326 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the \"500 Greatest Albums of All Time\". Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic called it the \"culmination of all the musical directions The Cure were pursuing over the course of the '80s\"."@en ;

Recording sessions for the album took place during 1992 to 1993 at Firehouse Studio in New York City, and it was mastered at The Hit Factory. The album's title originates from the martial arts film The 36th Chamber of Shaolin (1978). The group's de facto leader RZA, also known as Prince Rakeem, produced the album entirely, utilizing heavy, eerie beats and a sound largely based on martial-arts movie clips and soul music samples. The distinctive sound of Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers) created a blueprint for hardcore hip hop during the 1990s and helped return New York City hip hop to national prominence. Its sound also became greatly influential in modern hip hop production, while the group members' explicit, humorous, and free-associative lyrics have served as a template for many subsequent hip hop records. Serving as a landmark record in the era of hip hop known as the East Coast Renaissance, its influence helped lead the way for several other East Coast hip hop artists, including Nas, The Notorious B.I.G., Mobb Deep, and Jay-Z. Despite its raw, underground sound, the album had surprising chart success, peaking at number 41 on the US Billboard 200 chart. By 1995, it was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America, and has sold over two million copies in the United States. Initially receiving positive reviews from most music critics, Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers) is widely regarded as one of the most significant albums of the 1990s, as well as one of the greatest hip hop albums ever.

It was the first time since 1996 that the contest was held on mainland Europe. The contest was the second to be held in Stockholm, and the fourth held in Sweden. The presenters were Kattis Ahlstr\u00F6m and Anders Lundin, and the contest was won by the Olsen Brothers who represented Denmark with the song \"Fly on the Wings of Love\" (originally: Smuk som et stjerneskud). The song was written by one of the brothers, J\u00F8rgen Olsen. The Globe Arena was, at the time, the largest venue chosen to host the contest with a capacity of 16,000 spectators. The postcards used to introduce each country participating involved Swedish themes that incorporated each nation in some respect. All the postcards are flimed in Stockholm, Sweden, however, the only exception is the postcard for Sweden, which is flimed before Expo 2000 in Hanover, Germany. The logo for the contest, a pair of open mouth lips, was chosen by SVT, and was described by its designers as \"a sensual, yet stylistically pure mouth representing song, dialogue and speech\", and was later one of the possible choices for the generic logo introduced at the 2004 Contest. The favourite in this year's contest was Estonia, who was also a fan favourite and praised by the press. However, as the voting results came in, Denmark immediately took control of the scoreboard, beating Russia into second place and Latvia into 3rd place. Slovakia, Greece and Hungary decided not to compete for financial reasons. The countries with the five lowest average scores over the previous five contests who had participated in 1999, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Lithuania, Poland, Portugal and Slovenia were excluded meaning that five countries could return. These countries were: Finland, Macedonia, Romania, Russia and Switzerland. Latvia also joined contest as the only country to debut. For the first time, an official CD compilation was released; it contained all of the songs of the participating nations and was available throughout Europe. Such a disc was attempted in the previous year, however it lacked four of the competing songs. On 8 July 2015, it was revealed that the Ericsson Globe will host the contest again in 2016."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Fight for Your Mind is an album by Ben Harper. Released in August 1995, it was his last solo album before adding the Innocent Criminals to his line-up. Reviews were generally very positive, praising Harper's fusion of multiple genres, from folk (\"Another Lonely Day\"), folk rock (\"Gold to Me\"), Black Sabbath-style riffing heavy metal (\"Ground on Down\") and politically charged reggae (\"Excuse Me Mr.\"). After Harper's well-received debut, Welcome to the Cruel World, he expanded on his fanbase by touring relentlessly with jam bands like Dave Matthews Band. On this, his second album, Harper added a more refined sense of his own intense spirituality, such as on the gospel-influenced album closers, \"Power of the Gospel\", \"God Fearing Man\" and \"One Road to Freedom\"."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Fleetwood Mac is the tenth album by the British-American band Fleetwood Mac, released in 1975. It was the band's second eponymous album; the first was their 1968 album. Among Fleetwood Mac fans, the album is often referred to as the White Album. This is the first Fleetwood Mac album to feature Lindsey Buckingham as guitarist and Stevie Nicks as vocalist, after Bob Welch departed the band in late 1974. The album was also the group's last to be released on the Reprise label until 1997's The Dance (the group's subsequent albums until then were released through Warner Bros. Records, Reprise's parent company). The album reached number one on the Billboard 200 over a year after entering the chart, spent 37 weeks within the top 10, and more than fifteen months within the top 40. It launched three top twenty singles: \"Over My Head\", \"Rhiannon\" and \"Say You Love Me\", the last two falling just short of the top ten, both at No. 11. In 1986, it was certified 5x platinum by the RIAA representing shipments of five million units in the United States. \"Warm Ways\" was the first single lifted from the album in 1975 in the UK. It was not released as a single in the United States, where Over My Head was released instead. Initially, the album generated limited interest in the UK, as the first three singles released by the new lineup failed to chart. \"Say You Love Me\" charted on the UK Singles Chart and it reached No. 40 Following the massive success of Rumours two years later, interest in the band re-ignited and Fleetwood Mac was re-released in 1978, along with the single \"Rhiannon\" which peaked just outside the Top 40 at No. 46. The album eventually peaked at No. 23 on the UK Albums Chart but was a prelude to a run of hugely successful albums for the band in Britain, including four multi-platinum number ones: Rumours, Tusk, Tango in the Night and Behind the Mask. A live version of \"Landslide\" was eventually released as a single in the US in 1998 after it became one of the most popular tracks from the live reunion album The Dance. It reached No. 51 on the Billboard Hot 100."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Into the Pandemonium is the third studio album by Swiss extreme metal band Celtic Frost, released in 1987. The album is more varied than many of Celtic Frost's past LPs, with unlikely covers (Wall of Voodoo's \"Mexican Radio\"), emotionally charged love songs, the album's recurring industrial-influenced rhythmic songs of demons and destruction, traditional Frost-styled songs about dreams and fear, and a dark, classical piece with female vocals. The album is vastly different from the band's previous work and cemented its late 1980s avant-garde metal term; it is also a departure from the style found on the band's previous albums, Morbid Tales and To Mega Therion that Celtic Frost had become known for. However, it does have the recurring symphonic elements found on previous albums. The album has a more classic heavy metal style within the songs with elements of industrial, classical, gothic rock and doom metal. Eduardo Rivadavia of Allmusic called it \"one of the classic extreme metal albums of all time.\" The track \"Rex Irae\" is the opening part of Celtic Frost's requiem; the third, concluding part of which, \"Winter (Requiem, Chapter Three: Finale)\" can be heard on 2006's Monotheist. The second part of the requiem was never released by the band. \"Inner Sanctum\" was featured in the 2009 video game Grand Theft Auto IV: The Lost and Damned."@en ;

Morissette had released two successful albums in Canada, after which she left MCA Records Canada and was introduced to manager Scott Welch. Morissette began work her next album after moving from her hometown of Ottawa to Toronto, but did not make much progress until she travelled to Los Angeles, where she met Glen Ballard. Morissette and Ballard had an instant connection, and began co-writing and experimenting with different sounds. The experimentation resulted in an alternative rock album that took influence from post-grunge and pop rock, and featured guitars, keyboards, drum machines, and harmonica. The album's lyrics touched upon themes of aggression and broken relationships, while Ballard introduced a pop sensibility to Morissette's bitter angst. The album went on to be a huge success, topping the charts in ten countries, and has gone on to sell over 33 million units worldwide and ranked on numerous best-selling lists. Jagged Little Pill received acclaim from music critics and was nominated for a total of nine Grammy Awards, of which Morissette won five, including Album of the Year, making her the youngest artist in history to win the honour\u2014a record she held for 14 years; until country/pop singer Taylor Swift won Album of the Year at the 2010 Grammy Awards for her 2008 album Fearless.

It was recorded earlier that year on March 2 and April 22 at Columbia's 30th Street Studio in New York City. The recording sessions featured Davis's ensemble sextet, consisting of pianist Bill Evans, drummer Jimmy Cobb, bassist Paul Chambers, and saxophonists John Coltrane and Julian \"Cannonball\" Adderley, together with pianist Wynton Kelly on one track. After the entry of Evans into his sextet, Davis followed up on the modal experimentations of Milestones (1958) by basing Kind of Blue entirely on modality, in contrast to his earlier work with the hard bop style of jazz. Though precise figures have been disputed, Kind of Blue has been described by many music writers not only as Davis's best-selling album, but as the best-selling jazz record of all time. On October 7, 2008, it was certified quadruple platinum in sales by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). Kind of Blue has been regarded by many critics as jazz's greatest record, Davis's masterpiece, and one of the best albums of all time. Its influence on music, including jazz, rock, and classical genres, has led writers to also deem it one of the most influential albums ever recorded. Kind of Blue was one of fifty recordings chosen in 2002 by the Library of Congress to be added to the National Recording Registry, and in 2003, it was ranked number 12 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time."@en ;

Liquid Swords features numerous guest appearances from the entire nine piece Wu-Tang Clan, and also Wu-Tang affiliate Killah Priest. Upon its release, Liquid Swords peaked at number nine on the Billboard 200 chart, and number two on the Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart.

	dbo:abstract	"Loveless is the second studio album by Anglo-Irish rock band My Bloody Valentine. Released on 4 November 1991, the album was recorded over a two-year period between 1989 and 1991. Often dissatisfied with their recording environments, the group cycled through nineteen studios and a larger number of engineers during the album's two-year creation, with total recording costs rumoured to have reached \u00A3250,000. Vocalist and guitarist Kevin Shields dominated the arduous recording process, intent on achieving a particular sound; he experimented with guitar tremolo and tuning systems, unorthodox production techniques, obscured vocals, and sampled feedback and percussion. While Loveless did not achieve great commercial success upon its release, it received enthusiastic reviews from critics, who praised its sonic innovations and experimentation. Following the record's release, My Bloody Valentine were removed from their record label Creation Records due to the difficulty and expense of working with Shields, a factor that was alleged to have contributed to the bankruptcy of the label. In the subsequent years, the group struggled to record a follow-up album and would eventually break up in 1997. Loveless would be their last full-length release for over two decades. Since its release, Loveless has been widely proclaimed as among the best albums of the 1990s by critics, as a landmark work of the shoegazing genre, and as an influence on various subsequent artists. The album was reissued as a two-disc CD set on Sony in May 2012, containing remastered editions of the original digital tape and a previously unreleased \u00BD-inch analogue tape. The reissues placed in several international charts and in July 2013, Loveless was certified Silver in the United Kingdom by the British Phonographic Industry."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Metal Health is the third studio album by American heavy metal band Quiet Riot. It was released on March 11, 1983, bolstered by the No. 5 hit \"Cum On Feel the Noize\" and the No. 31 hit \"Metal Health\". Metal Health is notable for being the first heavy metal album to reach the top spot on the Billboard 200, replacing The Police's Synchronicity at number one in November 1983. The album went on to sell more than six million copies and is considered a classic among heavy metal fans. Some critics, such as AllMusic, describe it as a one-hit wonder, owing to Quiet Riot's relative lack of critical and commercial success with following albums (and subsequent disintegration) towards the end of the 1980s. The title track was ranked No. 35 on VH1's 40 Greatest Metal Songs. The band went on a tour the same year and supported Black Sabbath on their Born Again tour in the US. \"Slick Black Cadillac\" is a re-recorded version of the same song from Quiet Riot II. The song \"Thunderbird\" is dedicated to guitarist and founding member Randy Rhoads. Although the bulk of the song was written for Rhoads while he was still alive, Kevin DuBrow added one final verse as a tribute to Rhoads after he died in a plane crash on March 19, 1982. The title track is known by a number of slightly different names. It was simply called \"Metal Health\" on the original vinyl release, but most subsequent reissues of the album on other formats call it \"Bang Your Head\", with the phrase 'Metal Health' in parentheses, either before or after the \"main\" title. The lyric from that song,\" Well Now You're Here, There's No Way Back\", eventually became the title for Quiet Riot's documentary in 2014."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Modern Life Is Rubbish is the second studio album by the English alternative rock band Blur, released in May 1993. Although their debut album Leisure (1991) had been commercially successful, Blur faced a severe media backlash soon after its release, and fell out of public favour. After the group returned from an unsuccessful tour of the United States, poorly received live performances and the rising popularity of rival band Suede further diminished Blur's status in the UK. Under threat of being dropped by Food Records, for their next album Blur underwent an image makeover championed by frontman Damon Albarn. The band incorporated influences from traditional British guitar pop groups such as the Kinks and the Small Faces, and the resulting sound was melodic and lushly produced, featuring brass, woodwind and backing vocalists. Albarn's lyrics on Modern Life Is Rubbish use \"poignant humour and Ray Davies characterisation to investigate the dreams, traditions and prejudices of suburban England\", according to writer David Cavanagh. Modern Life Is Rubbish was a moderate chart success in the UK; the album peaked at number 15, while the singles taken from the album charted in the Top 30. Applauded by the music press, the album's Anglocentric rhetoric rejuvenated the group's fortunes after their post-Leisure slump. Modern Life Is Rubbish is regarded as one of the defining releases of the Britpop scene, and its chart-topping follow-ups\u2014Parklife and The Great Escape\u2014saw Blur emerge as one of Britain's leading pop acts."@en ;

There, he met the musicians he would record the album with at New York City's A & R Studios in 1969. Morrison abandoned the abstract folk compositions of Astral Weeks in favor of more formally composed songs on Moondance, which he wrote and produced himself. Its lively rhythm and blues music was the style he would become most known for in his career. The music incorporated soul, jazz, pop, and Irish folk sounds into ballads and songs about finding spiritual renewal and redemption in worldly matters such as nature, music, and romantic love. After Moondance was released in 1970 by Warner Bros. Records, it became both a critical and commercial success, helping establish Morrison as a major artist in popular music. It has since been cited by critics as one of the greatest albums of all time. In 2013, the album's remastered deluxe edition was released to similar acclaim."@en ;

Sparsely-recorded on a cassette-tape Portastudio, the tracks on Nebraska were originally intended as demos of songs to be recorded with the E Street Band. However, Springsteen ultimately decided to release the demos himself. Nebraska remains one of the most highly regarded albums in his catalogue. The songs on Nebraska both deal with ordinary, blue collar characters who face a challenge or a turning point in their lives, but also outsiders, criminals and mass murderers, who have little hope for the future - or no future at all, as in the title track, where the main character is sentenced to death in the electric chair. Unlike his previous albums, very little salvation and grace is present within the songs.

	dbo:abstract	"New Miserable Experience is the breakthrough album by power pop band Gin Blossoms, released on August 4, 1992. The album was released to little fanfare and relatively lackluster reviews. However, nearly a year after its release the lead single, \"Hey Jealousy\", entered the top 40, with \"Found Out About You\" following a few months later. The album eventually reached multi-platinum status. The band's guitarist, Doug Hopkins, was fired near the conclusion of the recording sessions for the album, ostensibly for his persistent alcohol problems. His replacement, Scott Johnson, is listed as a member of the band in the liner notes, but did not play on the album. Just as the album was becoming a success at the end of 1993, Hopkins committed suicide. New Miserable Experience's initial release had completely different packaging. The album's original cover artwork depicted the Arizona desert. Songs on the album, such as \"Mrs. Rita\", a song about a local psychic from the Gin Blossoms' hometown of Tempe, Arizona, were also written with references to the area, people and events surrounding the band at the time. The majority of the songs rely on a melody-driven pop style while the final track, \"Cheatin'\", leans into country music. The album was re-released in late summer 1993, in conjunction with A&M's newfound support of the album. To celebrate the album's tenth anniversary, a deluxe edition containing an extra disc of demos, outtakes and live performances was released by the label in 2002."@en ;

The band formed in 1971 and developed a following while playing regularly in lower Manhattan. However, they were unappealing to record companies because of their onstage cross-dressing and vulgarity, while most record producers were reluctant to work with them. For shock value, the band was photographed in exaggerated drag on the album cover. After signing a two-record deal with Mercury, the New York Dolls recorded their self-titled first album at The Record Plant in New York City with producer Todd Rundgren, who was known for his sophisticated pop sound and held a lukewarm opinion of the band. They incorporated carefree rock and roll and Brill Building pop influences in the album's hard rock songs, while the lyrics were written mostly by lead singer David Johansen and touched on themes such as urban youth, teen alienation, adolescent romance, and authenticity. New York Dolls received widespread acclaim from critics when it was first released but sold poorly and had a divisive effect on listeners. The band toured the United States to promote the record, but they were difficult to market and developed a reputation for rock-star excesses. Despite its commercial failure, the album was an influential precursor to the 1970s punk rock movement and has since been named in various publications as one of the greatest debut records in rock music and one of the greatest albums of all time."@en ;

Like Stereopathetic Soulmanure, the album never charted; however, One Foot in the Grave strengthened Beck's critical reputation, arguably allowing him to break into the mainstream with Odelay in 1996. One Foot in the Grave shows a strong folk influence that is more pronounced than on his more eclectic-style albums of the time, Mellow Gold and Odelay. One Foot in the Grave was recorded prior to the release of his third album Mellow Gold, but was not released until after that album met with critical and commercial success. The album features the production talents, songwriting talents, and occasional backing vocals of Calvin Johnson, founder of K Records. It was recorded at Dub Narcotic Studio, which was then housed in Calvin's basement. Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers would cover the track \"Asshole\" on the 1996 soundtrack album Songs and Music from \"She's the One\". Beck's cover of \"He's a Mighty Good Leader\" was featured in the 2003 film Holes. As of July 2008, One Foot in the Grave had sold 168,000 copies in the United States.

Kolderie and was recorded at Chipping Norton Recording Studios and Courtyard Studio, Oxfordshire from September to November 1992. It features three charting singles: \"Anyone Can Play Guitar\", \"Stop Whispering\", and perhaps the band's most well-known hit on mainstream radio, \"Creep\". Pablo Honey peaked at No. 22 in the United Kingdom charts and went platinum there and in other countries. The album title comes from a Jerky Boys prank call skit in which the prank caller says to his victim: \"Pablo, honey? Please come to Florida!\" This snippet is sampled by the band on the track \"How Do You?\". Following the release of Pablo Honey, Radiohead would digress from its alternative rock sound toward more expansive and experimental works. The album received a generally favourable reaction from critics, but was criticised for its derivative sound and inclusion of underdeveloped songs, and is held in a negative light in comparison to the band's subsequent albums.

Recording sessions for the album took place at several studios in England and was overseen by four different production teams, including Rupert Hine, and Martyn Ware and Ian Craig Marsh of Heaven 17. A radical departure from the rhythm and blues sound Turner had performed with her former husband and performing partner Ike Turner, the tracks in the album are a mixture of uptempos and ballads, which are basically inspired by pop and rock genres; it also features elements of smooth jazz and R&B.worldwide record sales have topped a staggering 25 million. After several challenging years of going solo after divorcing Ike, Private Dancer propelled Turner in becoming a viable solo star, as well as one of the most marketable crossover singers in the recording industry. It became a worldwide commercial success, earning multi-platinum certifications in Australia, Canada, Germany, the United Kingdom and the United States. To date, it remains her best-selling album in North America. Private Dancer produced seven singles, including \"What's Love Got to Do with It\", \"Better Be Good to Me\", \"Private Dancer\", and \"Let's Stay Together\". Positively received by critics on release for Turner's ability to give energy and raw emotion to slickly produced professional pop/rock songs; its long term legacy is that the softening of her raw Southern soul style produced a \"landmark\" in the \"evolution of pop-soul music\". The album was promoted throughout 1985 in a 177 date worldwide tour called the Private Dancer Tour."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Ramones is the debut studio album by the American punk rock band Ramones, released on April 23, 1976 by Sire Records. After Hit Parader editor Lisa Robinson saw the band at a gig in New York City, she wrote about them in an article and contacted Danny Fields, insisting he be their manager. Fields agreed and convinced Craig Leon to produce Ramones, and the band recorded a demo for prospective record labels. Leon persuaded Sire president Seymour Stein to listen to the band perform, and he later offered the band a recording contract. The Ramones began recording in January 1976, needing only seven days and $6,400 to record the album. They used similar sound-output techniques to those of the Beatles, and used advanced production methods by Leon. The album cover, photographed by Punk magazine's Roberta Bayley, features the four members leaning against a brick wall in New York City. The record company paid only $125 for the front photo, which has since become one of the most imitated album covers of all time. The back cover depicts an eagle belt buckle along with the album's liner notes. After its release, Ramones was promoted with two singles which failed to chart. The Ramones also began touring to help sell records; these tour dates were mostly based in the United States, though two were booked in Britain. Violence, drug use, relationship issues, humor, and Nazism were prominent in the album's lyrics. The album opens with \"Blitzkrieg Bop\", which is among the band's most recognized songs. Most of the album's tracks are uptempo, with many songs measuring at well over 160 beats per minute. The songs are also rather short; at two-and-a-half minutes, \"I Don't Wanna Go Down to the Basement\" is the album's longest track. Ramones contains a cover of the Chris Montez song \"Let's Dance\". Ramones peaked at No. 111 on the US Billboard 200 and was unsuccessful commercially; initially it received mixed reviews from the few critics who wrote about it. However, many later deemed it a highly influential record, and it has since received many accolades, such as the top spot on Spin magazine's list of the \"50 Most Essential Punk Records\". Ramones went on to inspire many bands like the Sex Pistols, the Buzzcocks, and the Clash, among others. Aside from sparking the punk-rock scene in both the US and UK, it has had a significant impact on other genres of rock music, such as grunge and heavy metal. The album was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America in 2014."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Rock Steady is the fifth studio album by American rock band No Doubt, released on December 11, 2001 by Interscope Records. The band began writing the album with initial recording sessions in Los Angeles and San Francisco, then traveled to London and Jamaica to work with various performers, songwriters, and producers. Sly & Robbie, The Neptunes, and William Orbit were among the many artists the band collaborated with on the album. As a result of these collaborations, Rock Steady touches on many musical styles, focusing on dub, synthpop, and dance styles more so than in the past. The band attempted to capture the vibe of Jamaican dancehall music, and experimented with writing songs without its standard instrumentation. Singer Gwen Stefani wrote her lyrics quickly in comparison to previous records, and dealt with topics ranging from partying to ruminations on her relationship with Gavin Rossdale. Rock Steady received mostly positive reviews from music critics, and it was nominated for Best Pop Vocal Album at the 2003 Grammy Awards. The album was a commercial comeback for the band, surpassing sales of their previous offering, Return of Saturn, released in 2000. Rock Steady spawned four singles, two of which won the Grammy Award for Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal. Rolling Stone ranked Rock Steady number 316 on its 2003 list of \"The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time\"."@en ;

For the record, much of Beck's trademark recondite and ironic lyrics were replaced by more sincere, simpler lyrical content. He also eschewed the heavy sampling of his previous albums for live instrumentation. When interviewed, Beck cited the breakup with his longtime girlfriend as the major influence on the album. Sea Change peaked at number 8 on the Billboard 200, later being certified gold in March 2005 by the Recording Industry Association of America.

The album marked a departure from the more rock-oriented sound of Badfinger's previous releases, partly as a result of intervention by Apple Records regarding the band's musical direction. Although Straight Up received a mixed response from critics on release, many reviewers now regard it as the band's best album. Rolling Stone critic David Fricke has referred to it as \"Badfinger's power-pop apex\". Production on what became Straight Up lasted nine months, at the start of which the group made an album's worth of recordings with producer Geoff Emerick, in between their touring commitments. Once Apple had decided to shelve these recordings, George Harrison took over production, only for him to become indisposed with events associated with the Concert for Bangladesh, at which Badfinger also performed. Harrison then handed the project to American producer Todd Rundgren, who oversaw recording for most of the album.

New female vocalist Slick, formerly with another San Francisco rock band the Great Society, joined the Airplane in the fall of 1966. Slick, Dryden, male lead vocalist Marty Balin, guitarist-vocalist-songwriter Paul Kantner, lead guitarist (and occasional vocalist) Jorma Kaukonen and bassist Jack Casady formed the core of the best-known line-up of the group, which would remain stable until Dryden's departure in early 1970.

dbr:Sweetheart_of_the_Rodeo	rdf:type	schema:MusicAlbum ;
	dbo:abstract	"Sweetheart of the Rodeo is the sixth album by American rock band The Byrds and was released on August 30, 1968 on Columbia Records (see 1968 in music). Recorded with the addition of country rock pioneer Gram Parsons, it was influential as the first major country rock album by an established act and represented a stylistic move away from the psychedelic rock of the band's previous LP, The Notorious Byrd Brothers. The Byrds had occasionally experimented with country music on their four previous albums, but Sweetheart of the Rodeo represented their fullest immersion into the genre thus far. The album was also responsible for bringing Gram Parsons, who had joined The Byrds prior to the recording of the album, to the attention of a mainstream rock audience for the first time. Thus, the album can be seen as an important chapter in Parsons' personal and musical crusade to make country music fashionable for a young audience. The album was initially conceived as a musical history of 20th century American popular music, encompassing examples of country music, jazz and rhythm and blues, among other genres. However, steered by the passion of the little-known Parsons, who had only joined The Byrds in February 1968, this proposed concept was abandoned early on and the album instead became purely a country record. The recording of the album was divided between sessions in Nashville and Los Angeles, with contributions from several notable session musicians, including Lloyd Green, John Hartford, JayDee Maness and Clarence White. Tension developed between Parsons and the rest of the band, guitarist Roger McGuinn especially, with some of Parsons' vocals being re-recorded, partly due to legal complications, and by the time the album was released in August, Parsons had left the band. The Byrds' move away from rock and pop towards country music elicited a great deal of resistance and hostility from the ultra-conservative Nashville country music establishment who viewed The Byrds as a group of long-haired hippies attempting to subvert country music. Upon its release, the album reached #77 on the Billboard Top LPs chart, but failed to reach the charts in the United Kingdom. Two attendant singles were released during 1968, \"You Ain't Goin' Nowhere\", which achieved modest success, and \"I Am a Pilgrim\", which failed to chart. The album received mostly positive reviews in the music press, but the band's shift away from psychedelic music alienated much of its pop audience. Despite being the most commercially unsuccessful Byrds' album to date upon its initial release, Sweetheart of the Rodeo is today considered to be a seminal and highly influential country rock album."@en ;

The band's most popular release, the album includes the hit singles \"Every Breath You Take,\" \"King of Pain,\", \"Wrapped Around Your Finger,\" and \"Synchronicity II.\" Much of the album's material was inspired by Arthur Koestler's The Roots of Coincidence, which inspired the title and concept of the album. At the 1984 Grammy Awards the album was nominated for a total of five awards including Album of the Year and won three. At the time of its release and following its immensely popular tour The Police were hailed as the \"Biggest Band in the World\". The album was number one on both the UK Albums Chart and the U.S. Billboard 200, and sold over 8 million copies in the U.S. Synchronicity was widely acclaimed by critics. Praise centered on its cohesive merging of disparate genres and sonic experimentation. The record has featured in numerous publications' lists of the best albums of the 1980s and the best albums of all time. Many consider Synchronicity to be the band's finest album. Rolling Stone described \"each cut on Synchronicity [as] not simply a song but a miniature, discrete soundtrack.\" It has since been included on their lists of the \"100 Best Albums of the Eighties\" and the \"500 Greatest Albums of All Time\". In 2009, Synchronicity was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame. In the 1983 Rolling Stone readers poll, Synchronicity was voted \"Album of the Year\". In the U.S., the chart-topping hit \"Every Breath You Take\" was the best-selling single of 1983 and fourth best-selling single of the decade.[citation needed]"@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"The Age of Plastic is the debut studio album written, produced and performed by British new wave duo The Buggles, composed of Trevor Horn and Geoff Downes. The album was produced on a budget of \u00A360,000. The songs were written by The Buggles between 1977\u20131979, with contributions on several tracks from Bruce Woolley. The backing tracks were recorded at Virgin's Town House in West London, while the vocals were recorded and mixed at Sarm East Studios. Mixing was completed before Christmas 1979. The name of the record was conceived from the group's intention of being a \"plastic group\". The album has lyrical themes of nostalgia and anxiety about the possible effects of modern technology. The titular song, \"Living in the Plastic Age\", views the experiences of watching media coverage of the Vietnam War, while \"Kid Dynamo\" follows a child overexposed to media and its resulting effects on him. Described by writers as the first technopop landmark, the record is an electropop new wave album that includes musical elements and influences of disco, punk, progressive rock and 1960s pop music. In a 1979 interview, Downes defined the album as \"science fiction music. It's like modern psychedelic music. It's very futuristic.\" Horn used pre-dated technology for the album to have sounds unlike what was typical in records that were released at the time. The Age of Plastic was released by Island Records in Australia in January 1980, and later in February in the UK. The album's release followed the success of the group's 1979 first single, \"Video Killed the Radio Star\", which reached number 1 on the UK Singles Chart. Most of the songs for the album were written during promotion of the song. Three subsequent singles, \"The Plastic Age\", \"Clean, Clean\" and \"Elstree\", all released in 1980, followed \"Video\", and also charted in the UK, reaching number 16, 38 and 55 respectively. In Europe, The Age of Plastic reached the Top 20 in Italy and the Top 40 in France, Norway, Sweden and the United Kingdom. In other continents, the album reached the top 40 in Japan and was number 83 on the Canadian RPM albums chart. It has been met with positive critical response, with some critics comparing it to other albums of its genre. There have been two reissues of the album, in 2000 and in 2010. A September 2010 performance of the album by the Buggles, a gig live at the \"Ladbroke Grove's Supperclub\" in Notting Hill, London, marked the first time the group performed it in its entirety."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill is the debut solo album by American recording artist Lauryn Hill, released on August 25, 1998, by Ruffhouse Records and Columbia Records. After touring with her former group Fugees, Hill became involved in a romantic relationship with Jamaican entrepreneur Rohan Marley, and shortly after, became pregnant with his child. This pregnancy, as well as other circumstances in her life, inspired Hill to make a solo album. Recording sessions for the album took place from late 1997 to June 1998 mainly at Tuff Gong Studios in Kingston, as Hill collaborated with a group of musicians known as New Ark in writing and producing the songs. Primarily a neo soul album, The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill incorporates musical styles from R&B, hip hop, soul, and reggae. Its lyrics touch upon Hill's pregnancy and the turmoil within the Fugees, along with themes of love and God. The album's title was inspired by the film and autobiographical novel The Education of Sonny Carson, and Carter G. Woodson's The Mis-Education of the Negro. The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 chart, selling 422,624 copies in its first week, which broke a record for first-week sales by a female artist. The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill produced three hit singles: \"Doo Wop (That Thing)\", \"Ex-Factor\", and \"Everything Is Everything\". Its lead single \"Doo Wop (That Thing)\" peaked at number one in the US, with the latter two singles peaking within the top 40. The album's success propelled Hill to international superstardom, and contributed to bringing hip hop and neo soul to the forefront of popular music. At the 41st Annual Grammy Awards, The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill earned 10 nominations, winning five awards, making Hill the first woman to receive that many nominations and awards in one night. By 2013, it had sold over 8 million copies in the US and over 19 million copies worldwide. Critics generally praised The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill for Hill's presentation of a woman's view on life and love, along with her artistic range. New Ark, however, felt Hill and her record label did not properly credit the group on the album; a lawsuit filed by the group was settled out of court in 2001. Since the record's release, it has been ranked in numerous best-album lists, with a number of critics regarding it as one of the greatest albums of the 1990s, as well as one of the greatest albums of all time. In 2015, it was included by the Library of Congress in the National Recording Registry."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"The Process of Belief is the twelfth studio album by the American punk rock band Bad Religion. It was produced by its leaders Greg Graffin and Brett Gurewitz, and was released on January 22, 2002 through Epitaph Records. After touring in support of its previous full-length studio album, The New America (2000), Gurewitz rejoined Bad Religion in 2001 after a seven-year hiatus. The band re-signed with Epitaph, and then began work on its first album for the label in over eight years. The album also marked the first album to feature Brooks Wackerman, who replaced former drummer Bobby Schayer. The Process of Belief was another huge success (debuting at #49 on the Billboard 200 chart) and it was well received by both critics and fans. The album has sold more than 220,000 units worldwide. The Process of Belief features one of Bad Religion's well-known songs \"Sorrow\", the band's first to chart in the US in six years, since \"A Walk\" (from 1996's The Gray Race). \"Broken\", \"The Defense\" and \"Supersonic\" also received radio airplay, but all failed to make any national chart (although \"Broken\" reached #125 on the UK Singles Chart). The album marked the return to the faster and more energetic songwriting style of Bad Religion's earlier albums, and many have compared it favorably to their past releases.[citation needed] Multiple songs of the album have become live staples of the band's shows, most notably \"Sorrow\". \"Broken\" and \"Kyoto Now!\" are also commonly played live, as well as the album's first three tracks, which are usually performed in one go."@en ;

Recording sessions for the album took place in June 1970 and March\u2013May 1971 at Hitsville U.S.A., Golden World and United Sound Studios in Detroit and at The Sound Factory in West Hollywood, California. What's Going On was the first album on which Motown Records' main studio band, the group of session musicians known as the Funk Brothers, received an official credit. The first Marvin Gaye album credited as being produced by the artist himself, What's Going On is a unified concept album consisting of nine songs, most of which lead into the next. It has also been categorized as a song cycle; the album ends on a reprise of the album's opening theme. The album is told from the point of view of a Vietnam War veteran returning to the country he had been fighting for, and seeing only hatred, suffering, and injustice. Gaye's introspective lyrics discuss themes of drug abuse, poverty, and the Vietnam War. He has also been credited with criticizing global warming before the public outcry against it had become prominent. What's Going On was an immediate success upon release, both commercially and critically. Having endured as a classic of 1970s soul, a deluxe edition set was released on February 27, 2001, and featured a rare recording of a May 1972 concert shot at Washington, D.C.'s Kennedy Center. Worldwide surveys of critics, musicians, and the general public have shown that What's Going On is regarded as one of the landmark recordings in pop music history, and one of the greatest albums of the 20th century.

The song uses examples such as the lions on the English football team's shirts, Britannia and the English patron saint, St. George (from Lebanon), the hyphen in Anglo-Saxon and the nation's favourite dish (curry) to convey his message that everything about English culture is shaped and influenced by the waves of immigration that have taken place in the past. The title is taken from England, Half English, a 1961 collection of essays and articles by Colin MacInnes, which includes a 1957 article called \"Young England, Half English\" about the influence of American pop music on English teenagers. \"Take Down The Union Jack\", a song from the album that protests against the monarchy, Queen Elizabeth II's Golden Jubilee and argues for English and Scottish independence.

As of November 2003, the album has sold 2.8 million copies in the United States. Some editions contain an album version of McLachlan's 1995 single used for The Brothers McMullen soundtrack, \"I Will Remember You\".

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Graceland_(album)>	rdf:type	schema:MusicAlbum ;
	dbo:abstract	"Graceland is the seventh solo studio album by American singer-songwriter Paul Simon. Produced by Simon and Roy Halee, the album was released on August 25, 1986 by Warner Bros. Records. In the early 1980s, Simon's career hit a low point. Following a very successful but contentious reunion with former partner Art Garfunkel, Simon's marriage fell apart and his previous record, Hearts and Bones (1983), was a significant commercial disappointment. In 1984, after a period of depression, Simon became fascinated with a bootleg cassette of South African township music. He planned a trip to Johannesburg in the new year with Halee, where he spent two weeks recording with South African musicians. Recorded between 1985\u201386, Graceland features an eclectic mixture of musical styles, including pop, rock, a cappella, zydeco, isicathamiya, and mbaqanga. Simon created new compositions inspired by the recordings made in Johannesburg, collaborating with both African and American artists. Simon faced controversy for seemingly breaking the cultural boycott imposed by the rest of the world against South Africa because of its policy of apartheid. In addition, some critics viewed Graceland as an exploitive appropriation of their culture. Following its completion, Simon toured alongside South African musicians, combining the music of Graceland and their own music. Despite the controversy, Graceland was a major commercial hit, becoming Simon's most successful studio album. His highest-charting effort in over a decade, Simon's return to the forefront of popular music was considered a remarkable comeback in a fickle music industry. It attracted excellent reviews from music critics, won the 1987 Grammy Award for Album of the Year, and sold over 16 million copies worldwide. Graceland has frequently been called one of the best albums of the 1980s, and is present on lists of greatest albums created by numerous publications. It was added to the National Recording Registry in 2007, having been judged to meet the Registry's admission criterion of being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically important.\""@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Britney is the self-titled third studio album by American singer Britney Spears. It was released on November 5, 2001, by JIVE Records. Looking to transition from the teen pop styles of her earlier albums ...Baby One More Time (1999) and Oops!... I Did It Again (2000), Spears began to embrace a maturer sound with her next studio effort. Its music incorporates genres of pop and dance-pop with influences of R&B and occasionally dips into elements of disco, hip hop and rock; its lyrics address the subjects of reaching adulthood and sexuality. Contributions to its production came from a variety of collaborators, including Max Martin and Rami Yacoub. Spears herself assumed a more prominent role in the album's development, co-writing five of its tracks. Upon its release, Britney received generally mixed reviews from music critics, who complimented the progression from Spears's earlier works, but criticized her increasingly provocative image. The album debuted at number one on the US Billboard 200 with first-week sales of 745,000 copies. Its success made Spears the first female artist to have her first three albums debut atop the chart, a record she would later break again with her fourth record In the Zone (2003). To promote the album, Spears embarked on the Dream Within a Dream Tour, which began in November 2001 and continued through July 2002. The album received a Grammy Award nomination for Best Pop Vocal Album. Six singles were released from the album, all of which proved less successful than those of Spears's prior records. Consequentially, Britney became her first record not to yield a US Billboard Hot 100 top ten hit. Its lead single \"I'm a Slave 4 U\" peaked at number twenty-seven on the chart, while follow-up singles \"Overprotected\", \"I'm Not a Girl, Not Yet a Woman\", \"I Love Rock 'n' Roll\", \"Anticipating\", and \"Boys\" reached the lower end of the chart and its extension, the Bubbling Under Hot 100 Singles."@en ;

The album reached number thirty-eight on Billboard's Independent Albums chart in 2002, when The White Stripes' popularity began to grow. It has since become a cult favorite among White Stripes fans, due to the simplicity of the band's blues/punk fusion. De Stijl (\"the style\" in English) was a Dutch art movement (including the painter Mondrian). Vocalist Jack White had been an admirer of the style for some time, especially of furniture designer Gerrit Rietveld. Rietveld designed the Rietveld Schr\u00F6der House, which Jack and Meg White visited while on tour in the Netherlands. De Stijl was dedicated to both Rietveld and Blind Willie McTell. It was after the tour began for De Stijl that Jack finally closed his upholstery shop. On February 5, 2008, Canadian media reported that former Radio-Canada host Dominique Payette filed a lawsuit against The White Stripes for using a nine-second clip of her interview with a little girl at the beginning of \"Jumble, Jumble\". She demanded $70,000 in damages and the removal of the album from store shelves. The dispute was settled out of court. The re-issued vinyl LP version of the record was pressed at United Record Pressing in Nashville, Tennessee and mastered all-analog from the original master tapes. The song 'Apple Blossom' was used in Quentin Tarantino's film The Hateful Eight."@en ;

Lead singer Gordon Downie is known for his intensity and spontaneity during the band's live concerts such as telling rants/stories, observations, and random comments before, during, and after songs, among other things. As such, this live recording documents him singing verses of other artists' songs in the middle of the band's own songs, including David Bowie/Iggy Pop's \"China Girl\" and The Beach Boys' \"Don't Worry Baby\" during \"New Orleans Is Sinking\", and both Jane Siberry's \"The Temple\" and Rheostatics' \"Bad Time to Be Poor\" during \"Nautical Disaster\". The Rheostatics were the opening act on the tour as documented by this album's liner notes, and announced by Downie during the fade-in at the beginning of the album's first track. In the week of the album's release, eight songs from the album appeared in the week's Top 20 singles chart. The title comes from graffiti in Kingston, Ontario, which read \"The Hip live between us.\" This graffiti was penned by early band member Davis Manning, describing the impact that the band was having on his relationship with his girlfriend. The mural remained on the wall until the mid-2000s when it was painted over by the property owner. However, it is immortalized on the CD graphic."@en ;

In October 1999, Page teamed up with The Black Crowes for a two-night performance of material from the Led Zeppelin catalogue and old blues and rock standards. Due to contractual problems with their record company, The Black Crowes were unable to release any of their own songs which were played at the Greek shows. These songs, on which Jimmy Page played with the Crowes, included: \"Wiser Time\", \"No Speak No Slave\", \"Remedy\", and \"Hard to Handle\". The double CD was released in stores by TVT Records on 4 July 2000, and featured a different track running order, an extra song, an enhanced QuickTime video and photographs taken during the concert. The Japanese version of the album also features \"Misty Mountain Hop\" and \"In the Light\", recorded in 2000."@en ;

dbr:Mean_Business	rdf:type	schema:MusicAlbum ;
	dbo:abstract	"Mean Business is the second and final studio album by The Firm, released by Atlantic Records on 3 February 1986. Repeating the same bluesy formula as on the first album, The Firm (1985), Mean Business did not achieve the same commercial success. One of the album's tracks, \"Live in Peace\", was first recorded on Paul Rodgers' first solo album in 1983, Cut Loose. The versions differ in that Chris Slade played the drums slower than on the original version, apart from the ending, and Jimmy Page added a bluesy guitar solo at the end of the song.[citation needed] The album's title was intended to have a double meaning: that the music business is a hard one, and that the band was serious about its music (\"The Firm mean business\"). However, perhaps due to the lukewarm-at-best critical and financial success which the band met, Page and Rodgers decided to disband The Firm within months of this album's release.[citation needed] The album peaked at #22 on the Billboard 200 albums chart.[citation needed] and at #46 on the UK Albums Chart. The single \"All the King's Horses\" spent four weeks at the top of Billboard's Mainstream Rock Tracks chart.[citation needed] \"Fortune Hunter\" was originally co-written by Page and Chris Squire for the aborted XYZ project in 1981. Squire was not credited on The Firm's version and later said he would have sued for royalties if the album had been a hit, but since it failed he dropped the idea because he saw it as inappropriate at a time when he was receiving six-figure yearly income from the sales of 90125.[citation needed]"@en ;

It is the first Helloween album to feature Sascha Gerstner on guitars, who replaced Roland Grapow. No drummer is listed in the band line-up for this album. Mark Cross was hired for the position before recording, but only managed to complete two tracks (\"Don't Stop Being Crazy\" and \"Listen to The Flies\") before being forced to leave due to illness. Mikkey Dee of Mot\u00F6rhead played on the rest of the songs on a session basis. The Japanese version contains a cover of Accept's \"Fast as a Shark,\" with the band's new drummer, Stefan Schwarzmann. Commenting on Dee's performance, bassist Markus Grosskpf said: About the album title, bassist Markus Grosskopf explained in 2003 that \"It's based on that English saying, pulling a rabbit out of the hat. Pulling this rabbit [the album] out of this hat [in reference to recent line up changes] wasn't that easy this time. That gave us the idea of just calling the album Rabbit Don't Come Easy. [Laughs] It's not to be taken too seriously. We were joking that statement around, and then I suggested we actually call the album that\". About the recording of the album, singer Andi Deris said in 2003 that producer Charlie Bauerfeind \"shows on this new record that he is the biggest fan of our genre of music because he knows how to separate the frequencies and knows where the power has to be. You have to imagine that this type of music is so packed with frequencies that it is nearly impossible to mix because it is so overloaded and you have to single out all of the instruments so you can hear them all\". After the controversial release of The Dark Ride, according to Grosskopf, \"The record company also wanted us to show that were are back. This song \"Just a Little Sign\" represents the more typical side of Helloween, and that's what we wanted to make clear. You can't really represent a whole album with one track, but this shows exactly where the album actually goes. It's more of that 'happy happy Helloween' direction. It shows that this album is not a sequel to 'The Dark Ride'\"."@en ;

dbr:The_Colour_and_the_Shape	rdf:type	schema:MusicAlbum ;
	dbo:abstract	"The Colour and the Shape is the second studio album by American rock band Foo Fighters. Produced by Gil Norton, it was released through Capitol Records and the group's own Roswell Records on May 20, 1997. The record is the debut of the Foo Fighters as a group, as the band's previous record, Foo Fighters (1995), was primarily recorded by frontman Dave Grohl and friend Barrett Jones as a demo. After the project ballooned and became an international success, the group convened for pre-production in the fall of 1996 and brought in producer Norton to establish a pop sensibility for the tracks. The band strived to create a full-fledged rock record, although the music press predicted another grunge offshoot. Primarily inspired by Grohl's divorce from photographer Jennifer Youngblood in 1996, the lyricism on the record is substantially more introspective and the music more developed. The album's track listing was designed to resemble a therapy session, splitting the album between up-tempo tracks and ballads, reflecting conflicting emotions. Early sessions at Washington farm studio Bear Creek were poor and led the band to discard most of the recordings. The band regrouped without drummer William Goldsmith in early 1997 to record a second time at Hollywood's Grandmaster Recordings, with Grohl sitting in on drums instead. Goldsmith was offended and disgruntled that most of his material was re-recorded and left the band shortly thereafter. Main singles \"Monkey Wrench\", \"Everlong\" and \"My Hero\" peaked within the top ten on United States rock radio, and the album charted at number three in the United Kingdom. Critics found the album a significant American rock release of the era, and it is now viewed as a seminal modern rock album. It was nominated for Grammy Award in 1998 for Best Rock Album. The Colour and the Shape is the Foo Fighters' biggest U.S. seller, having sold over two million copies according to Nielsen SoundScan. The album was remastered and reissued in 2007 with several bonus tracks, celebrating its tenth anniversary."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Tres Hombres (Spanish for \"three men\", meaning the three members of the band) is the third album by the American rock band ZZ Top. It was released in 1973. The album was the first of many times the band worked with Terry Manning as engineer. It was a successful combination as the release was the band's first commercial breakthrough. In the US, the album entered the top ten while the single \"La Grange\" reached number 41 on the singles charts. (Meanwhile, \"La Grange\" debuted number 33 on the American Top 40 broadcast on June 29, 1974.) At the height of ZZ Top's success in the mid-1980s a digitally remixed version of the recording was released on CD and the original 1973 mix version was discontinued. The remix version created controversy among fans because it significantly changed the sound of the instruments, especially drums. The remix version was used on all early CD copies and was the only version available for over 20 years. A remastered and expanded edition of the album was released on February 28, 2006, which contains three bonus live tracks. The 2006 edition is the first CD version to use Manning's original 1973 mix."@en ;

More melodic than their previous album, Smeared, Geffen gave the record little promotion because it defied the label's commercially dominant grunge rock style of the time.

After refusing to change their group's name, Death was turned away by Clive Davis of Columbia Records. Only seven songs were completed and the album was never released. The surviving songs were released as ...For the Whole World to See in 2009 by Drag City. Just prior to and right after the record's release, the songs on ...For the Whole World to See were performed live by Rough Francis, a band formed by the three sons of Death's original bassist. With the record's critical acclaim and praise from many other musicians, the two surviving members of Death reformed the band with a new guitarist to promote the record themselves. Initial critical response to ...For the Whole World to See was positive. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album has received an average score of 76, based on 8 reviews. Jack White of The White Stripes related his first reaction to the album in a New York Times article: \"I couldn\u2019t believe what I was hearing.

The latter track was made more famous by country singer Ronnie Milsap, as \"What a Difference You've Made in My Life\". Contemporary Christian music was coming out of its infancy, but at first, albums made by early Contemporary Christian music artists did not have enough copies to meet the growing demands in the primary and secondary markets. Grant made an effort to make Contemporary Christian music a dream come true by making her first album. She was the first person to do it successfully and carefully. When it was released, it sold well, with 50,000 copies at stake. It was reissued in 1980, this time it became a bestseller, with an estimated hundreds and thousands of copies sold. Thus, Grant's Christian music career begins with a successful effort and her dream becoming a true fact.[citation needed]"@en ;

The second disc (\"Black\") is made up of the more rock and upbeat material and touching on genres such as hard rock, funk and gospel. The album saw Harper playing the majority of the instruments on both discs; an approach that he had rarely used on his previous albums. However, the Innocent Criminals would appear on a few tracks whilst his later band, Relentless7, would appear together for the first time on \"Serve Your Soul\", the last track on the second disc. The album became Harper's first US top 10 hit on the Billboard Hot 200 album charts, entering and peaking at number seven on its release. To date, it is his highest album entry in that chart."@en ;

It is the first studio album released by Duff in eight years, since 2007's Dignity. Duff began work on the album in January 2012, but after scrapping the songs she recorded, she resumed the sessions on September 2013, continuing throughout 2014 and 2015. After being signed to RCA Records in 2014, she released the singles, \"Chasing the Sun\" and \"All About You\". She later recorded more songs in Sweden in February 2015, and released the single, \"Sparks\". The resulting album from the various recording sessions has combined Duff's dance-pop sound with EDM and folk-pop elements. The album received generally positive reviews from music critics, praising the album's production quality and the mix of genres on the record. The album debuted at number five on the Billboard 200 Chart, making it her fifth top-five entry. It also achieved top 5 positions in Australia and Canada. It also marked a few milestones in Duff's comeback to music with the single \"All About You\" being her first top 20 hit in Australia in nearly ten years, and the single \"Sparks\" which became her first top ten hit on the Billboard's Dance Chart since 2008's \"Reach Out\", her fourth top ten entry, and her fifth single to chart there overall. It's lead single \"Chasing the Sun\" was also Duff's first single to chart on the Billboard Hot 100 since her single \"Stranger\", which was released in 2007. Duff worked with a number of famous singer-songwriters. She teamed up with English singer Ed Sheeran for the track \"Tattoo\" and with Tove Lo for the single \"Sparks\", apart from working with Matthew Koma for the title track among others.

	dbo:abstract	"Crash! Boom! Bang! is Roxette's fifth studio album, released on 9 April 1994. Though highly successful in Europe and South America, the album was badly marketed by EMI in the United States. A shorter version of the album was made available a few months earlier, as a special deal at the McDonald's restaurant chain, called Favorites from Crash! Boom! Bang!. The Japanese version includes the track \"Almost Unreal\", which was taken from the 1993 film Super Mario Bros.. However the song was titled \"It's Almost Unreal\" for unknown reasons. In the UK a vinyl version of the album was also released, despite CDs taking over as the mainstream format. \"Sleeping in My Car\", \"Crash! Boom! Bang!\", \"Fireworks\", \"Run to You\" and \"Vulnerable\" were released as singles. \"Sleeping in My Car\" became the duo's final chart success in Australia, quickly debuting at #24, and then slipping down the chart just as quickly."@en ;

First single, \"Ya Mong Trong Nun (Don't Look at That)\", was one of her greatest hits. The music video was wonderful. Although her love ballad single, \"Fak Kwam Yin Dee (Pleasing Your Girl)\", was not very famous. It was maybe because the song talk about the hopeless broken heart, contrast with her previous big hit love ballad single \"Rak Thur Thee Sud (Love You The Most)\". The 3rd single was \"Pood Eek Thee (Say It Again)\". The song had colorful and joined lyric. It talk about the girl want her boyfriend to say \"Love\" again. The music video also help the single to be hit. Christina dressed in colorful 60th style. This single was her most popular track in the dance club. The 4th single was another love ballad song, \"Mai Tong Khob Jai (Don't Say Thank You)\".In this album, Christina also wrote the 5th single that was \"Tai Pa Hom Oun (Underneath a Worm Blanket)\".

	dbo:abstract	"Gravitational Forces is an album by Texas-based country/folk singer-songwriter Robert Earl Keen. It was first released in the United States on August 7, 2001 on Lost Highway. One reviewer described this album, Keen's ninth, as being \"just a hair more to the country side of the folk-rock-country axis than ever before.\" Indeed, producer and multi-instrumentalist Gurf Morlix, and the various long-time members of Keen's own road band did not shy away from including fiddle solos and steel guitars in the mix when they suit Keen's songs. \"I wanted to keep a real natural, organic sound,\" says Morlix, \"My job as producer varies from artist to artist. I help them find the sound they want and then do what it takes to get that on record.\" As usual, Keen's songwriting is full of narrative stories and character sketches. Performing Songwriter described the characters found in Gravitational Forces as \"everyday people pulled, led, and sometimes dragged by some outside strength.\" Billboard noted, however, that Keen's more recent tales avoid some of the violent imagery found in some of his earlier songs. Keen has admitted, \"Yeah, the body count's a little lower this time.\" Keen began recording the album after his previous label, Arista Austin had closed down, and before finding his new, albeit brief, home on Lost Highway Records. \"When we started this project I hadn't made a deal with any record company,\" Keen says, \"I just knew I would have a deal one way or another.\" The release arrived at a time when Keen was beginning to receive wider recognition outside of his home state of Texas. As of 2007, Gravitational Forces remains Keens highest charting album on several of Billboard's charts (see below)."@en ;

It contains 16 tracks, 8 of which were Billboard Top 10 Pop Singles, another 4 that were Billboard Top 40 Pop Singles, and 4 that received heavy airplay on FM album oriented rock stations. This album essentially replaced Styx's previous greatest hits album, Styx - Classics, Volume 15, which was released by A&M in 1987. That previous album had excluded the hit song \"Lady\" because the song was originally recorded for and released through Wooden Nickel Records (which also had a distribution arrangement with RCA Records). Because A&M/Polygram had been unable to secure distribution rights to the song, most of the classic lineup of Styx (Dennis DeYoung, Tommy Shaw, Chuck Panozzo, and James \"J.Y.\" Young) reunited to re-record the track at Dennis' home studio, The White Room. They were joined by uncredited session drummer Todd Sucherman, who filled in for John Panozzo due to Panozzo's failing health; Sucherman joined the band permanently in 1996, during the Return to Paradise tour. The track, which is very similar to the original, was titled \"Lady '95\". With the exception of \"Lady '95\", Styx - Greatest Hits features the original album versions of all the other songs included in the compilation. \"Come Sail Away\" is presented here in its full 6:05 version and \"Miss America\" is here in its original studio version (despite the CD's packaging showing incorrect time listings for both tracks)."@en ;

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hitler_Bad,_Vandals_Good>	rdf:type	schema:MusicAlbum ;
	dbo:abstract	"Hitler Bad, Vandals Good is the seventh studio album by the southern California punk rock band The Vandals, released in 1998 by Nitro Records. Much of the album is characterized by the pop-punk music and humorous lyrics for which the band is known, and it became their most popular and commercially successful album to date. While the band has utilized humor as a basis for much of their lyrical content throughout their career, the humor on their previous album The Quickening had been rooted heavily in sarcasm and dealt with themes of nihilism and apathy. By comparison, the humor in Hitler Bad, Vandals Good is more lighthearted, dealing with subjects such as girlfriends, fast food and hairstyles. The album contains two cover songs. \"Come Out Fighting\" was originally performed by fellow southern California punk rock band Pennywise and is dedicated to the memory of Pennywise bassist Jason Matthew Thirsk, who had committed suicide the previous year. \"So Long, Farwell\" is a Rodgers and Hammerstein song from the musical The Sound of Music, which has here been re-interpreted using electric guitar, bass and drums as the closing song on the album. An independent music video was later filmed for the song \"My Girlfriend's Dead.\" Two different videos were released: One features the band members and was filmed as part of the Kung Fu Films movie That Darn Punk in 2000, while the other is a fan-created animated video that was included on one of Kung Fu Records' DVD releases."@en ;

The band's earlier albums had been characterized by loud guitars, but later albums saw the band progress to a softer sound, incorporating keyboards. I Am the Portuguese Blues saw the return of the sound from earlier albums, as the band was stripped just to Jeff Cloud on bass, Frank Lenz on drums, and Jason Martin, the only person to perform on all of Starflyer 59's albums, handling guitar and vocal duties. In addition, the album has a monochromatic cover, similar to those of Starflyer 59's first three albums (Silver, Gold, and Americana). Many of the songs on I Am the Portuguese Blues were written years earlier as demos for an album to follow Americana. They were eventually scrapped, as the band decided to take a different musical direction for The Fashion Focus. The old demos were refined and combined with several new songs for I Am the Portuguese Blues. In regards to the title of the album, Martin, the band's frontman said,"@en ;

After the success of her fourth album, Get Here (1988), Russell collaborated again with a variety of different producers and songwriters. Taking more of a dance-oriented slant than her previous album, Russell worked with the famed songwriter/producer Narada Michael Walden who ultimately co-wrote and produced two tracks for the album with her, including the title track and \"Stop Running Away\" - both of which were released as singles. Also included on the album was Russell's own version of \"Dinner with Gershwin\", a track that Russell had written years earlier and given to Donna Summer who had a minor hit with it in 1987 (Russell had co-produced Summer's version with Richard Perry)."@en ;

dbr:Lazyboy_TV	rdf:type	schema:MusicAlbum ;
	dbo:abstract	"Lazyboy TV is the 2004 album by pop music/spoken word project Lazyboy (known as Lazy B in the UK). The album contains trivia, philosophical advice, stand-up comedy and social commentary on American society spoken over contemporary hip hop-esque beats. The project was initiated by producers Soren Rasted (of the bands Aqua and Hej Matematik) and Johnny Douglas, who dubbed the style \"Rhythm'n'Speak\". Performers featured include American comedian Greg Giraldo, British voice-over artist Julie Berry and singer Toby Chapman. In many countries several songs from the album were re-dubbed in various languages. The Japanese release, for example, featured Japanese language versions of \"Facts of Life\", \"Inhale Positivity\", \"This is the Truth\", \"We Only Read the Headlines\" and \"The Manual (Chapter 4)\", with the original English versions of the first two featured as bonus tracks. Initial European and Japanese pressings included the song \"I Love N.Y.\" which featured Lene Nystr\u00F8m on vocals, also formerly of Aqua. Subsequent releases removed the song for unknown reasons and substantially changed the track listing. Many copies came with four music videos -- \"Underwear\", \"Facts\", \"Inhale\", and \"Manual\" - either on a bonus DVD or as enhanced content on the disc. Original pressings of the bonus DVD also included the video for \"I Love N.Y.\". The song \"DVD Players\" is hidden approximately 11 minutes of silence after the final track. The single \"Underwear Goes Inside the Pants\" was a success in Australia and reached #8, and was also the most downloaded song on iTunes. The accompanying music video got regular airplay on MTV, along with the video for \"Facts of Life\". However the album release as well as the third single \"Inhale Positivity\" failed to reach the charts anywhere in the world."@en ;

The song reached #59 on the Hot 100 and #4 on the R&B chart. The third single \"I Miss You\" was the biggest hit for Klymaxx, reaching #5 on the Hot 100, #11 on the R&B chart and #1 on the adult contemporary chart. The single was certified gold. The fourth and final single was the dance hit \"Lock and Key\", which was a moderate hit for Klymaxx. It only reached #47 on the R&B chart. It was rumored that there was to be a fifth single released from the album. It was believed that \"Video Kid\" was supposed to be the single.

It was held off the top spot by King, then ruling the charts with the blockbuster Tapestry album, which contained her version of \"You've Got a Friend\". (Taylor also worked with King on her album and appears on several tracks performing acoustic guitar and backing vocals.) Months later, the album managed to generate another Top 40 hit, \"Long Ago and Far Away\", which reached #31 on the Billboard Hot 100. Other songs became standards in concert, particularly \"You Can Close Your Eyes\".

The album, composed almost entirely of samples taken from other artists' music, falls under the mashup genre. It also features minor amounts of original instrumentation recorded by Girl Talk himself. He constructed Night Ripper whilst working as a biomedical engineer, dividing time between both of his occupations. The album was originally produced as one seamless piece of music before subsequently being broken into individual tracks. The album was produced by Girl Talk in seven to eight months and mastered by Jonathan Schenke. Illegal Art initially released Night Ripper as a digital download on their website, later making the album available on other sites and shipping the album to select record stores due to strong demand. None of the samples used on the album were cleared prior to release, causing several online retailers to pull the album from their listings. Night Ripper was later re-released for download on the Illegal Art website through a new \"pay what you want\" pricing system. Night Ripper received generally positive reviews from critics, who commended Girl Talk's choice of samples and his efficiency at layering them together to create new tracks. It appeared in numerous publications' year-end lists of the best albums of 2006. The album has been described as Girl Talk's breakthrough album, helping boost his reputation and leading several artists to commission him for remix work."@en ;

dbr:Night_and_Day_II	rdf:type	schema:MusicAlbum ;
	dbo:abstract	"Night and Day II is a 2000 album by Joe Jackson. It was a revisit of the style of a prior album, Night and Day. The songs are about a New York City lifestyle, seen through different characters. The album featured a new set of songs in the spirit of his most popular previous recording. While the original Night and Day (1982) took a satirical look at the downfalls of city life through songs such as \"TV Age\", \"Cancer\" and \"Real Men\", Night and Day II is a commentary on the dark side of inner city living as seen though the eyes of a cynical New Yorker (Jackson lived in New York at the time). \"Hell of a Town\" and \"Stranger Than You\" sarcastically portray New York City life, as do lyrics from songs like \"Just Because\": making a commentary on Rudy Giuliani's mayoralty. This reflection of the original Night and Day album can be seen in many forms: from the cover (the artwork from 1982's Night and Day features a white background while the photograph from 2000s Night and Day II is a dark nighttime shot taken from within a New York City cab, and shows the World Trade Center just a year before 9/11), to the perceived presentation order of each song's motif \u2014 Night and Day feels as if the listener is being taken on a journey, via the song motifs, from daytime to night while Night and Day II presents a sensation of moving from nighttime to day (\"Glamour and Pain\" to \"Love Got Lost\" demonstrates this fully as \"Glamour and Pain\" deals with a prostitute's lamentations while \"Love Got Lost\" is mostly placed during Marianne Faithfull's fictitious working day). \"Happyland\" is about the 1990 arson fire at Happy Land Social Club in the Bronx that killed 87 people. The final song of the album, \"Stay,\" is possibly ironic, given that Jackson left New York to return to England in 2003. The music is built with contributions from Graham Maby (bass), and Sue Hadjopoulos (percussion). Also featured are the string quartet Ethel, and three guest vocalists: Iranian diva Sussan Deyhim, drag performer Dale De Vere and Marianne Faithfull, who sings vocals on \"Love Got Lost\"."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Nobody's Daughter is the fourth studio album by American alternative rock band Hole, released worldwide on April 27, 2010 (see ) through Mercury Records. The album was originally conceived by Hole frontwoman Courtney Love as a solo project titled How Dirty Girls Get Clean, following her poorly received solo debut America's Sweetheart (2004). Much of the material featured on Nobody's Daughter originated from studio sessions for How Dirty Girls Get Clean, which had been conceived in 2006 after a multitude of legal issues, drug addiction, and rehabilitation sentences had left Love \"suicidal\". Love financed the making of the record herself, which cost nearly two million dollars. In 2009, Love announced that the album would be released under the band name Hole, along with guitarist Micko Larkin, bassist Shawn Dailey and drummer Stu Fisher. It was the first Hole album to be released in twelve years, since 1998's Celebrity Skin, and also the group's first release to not feature Eric Erlandson. Upon its release, Nobody's Daughter received generally mixed reviews from music critics, though Courtney Love stated that she felt it was \"the best record she'd ever made\". In 2012, Love abandoned the Hole moniker and returned to writing and recording as a solo artist, making Nobody's Daughter the band's final release."@en ;

The album charted well in the UK, reaching number five on the UK Albums Chart, and was also received well on the US dance chart.

Additional vocals were provided by Billie Ray Martin. The artwork to the album is a tribute to Tamara de Lempicka and is influenced by her style and includes a version of her painting \"Andromeda\", which was originally a nude.

US, German and French title: Over Under Sideways Down) is an album by English blues rock band The Yardbirds, released in 1966. It was produced by bassist Paul Samwell-Smith and Simon Napier-Bell. It was the only Yardbirds album with all original material. Although the record was officially titled Yardbirds (and still is in authoritative chart sources, such as The Guinness Book of British Hit Albums), it has since been referred to, first colloquially, then semi-officially, as Roger the Engineer, a title stemming from the cover drawing of the record's audio engineer Roger Cameron by band member Chris Dreja. The album was included in Robert Dimery's 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die. In 2012, the album was ranked #349 on Rolling Stone's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Seven Sleepers is a Japan-only EP by the British rock band Feeder. It was the first ever release by the band after their label, Echo, was downstreamed into a copyrights exploitation company and as a result announced that they would not be releasing any new records or signing any new artists. This meant that Feeder were without a UK record label, and that, for the duration of being unsigned in the UK, they could not release any material in their home country. Before the band's 2008 winter tour, there were plans to release a tour-only EP which would be available at merchandise stalls at the venues the band would be playing. In 2007, the band entered the The Crypt studios to record their sixth studio album, Silent Cry; at the same time, Echo were up for sale and were in financial trouble, and would not release the album until a buyer was found. With EMI offering a price that was too low for the label, and many delays in the album already having been caused, Echo decided to release the album with hopes that it would bring the label back afloat, after the commercial success achieved with Feeder's previous release The Singles. However, with BBC Radio 1 not playing its first single \"We Are the People\" and a relatively low chart placing for the single at #25, alongside the album having very little promotion due to Echo's financial worries, the album quickly dropped out of the top 75 weekly album listing, despite an unexpected chart entry at #8 due to a lack of commercial pre-release awareness. Amongst the recordings for the album were a series of tracks that did not make the final cut, and were used as b-sides for \"We Are the People\" and other singles that were due to be released. However, due to the album's underwhelming sales, no more singles containing those tracks were released, meaning that the planned b-sides were locked in the vaults. Later on in the year, the band planned to self-release a tour EP, and included a few new songs for it, with those being \"Seven Sleepers\" and \"Snowblind\", meaning that they would be exclusive to the release. However, due to contract laws meaning that they were still under Echo, this never materialised. The following year, the band were still signed to their Japanese label Victor, meaning that they could still release the tracks over there anyway. Echo also decided not to claim ownership of the new tracks, with only Victor doing so. As a result, this became Feeder's first ever release not to have any release involvement from the label, with no Echo imprint appearing on the inlay and the obi strip. The EP was then completed, with a series of already released tracks making the total up to six. Many fans aware of the EP claim this to be the sort of direction the band should go towards for their next album, after giving Silent Cry a positive reception."@en ;

Sheryl Crow was a commercial success, being certified 3\u00D7 platinum by the RIAA and 3\u00D7 platinum by the BPI. It also reached No. 6 on the US Billboard Top 200 chart and produced five singles, including the international hit \"If It Makes You Happy\". The album received very positive reviews from critics, who praised its intricate production and Crow's louder and more assured singing. At the 39th Annual Grammy Awards, the album was awarded Best Rock Album and Crow received the Best Female Rock Vocal Performance award for \"If It Makes You Happy\".

This, more or less, was his attempt at creating a commercialized sound to his music. Tracks like \"Feast of Stephen\" are clear evidence that Heron desired to create rock-orientated pieces. Still, Heron had folk pieces with tracks like \"Flowers of the Forest\". Heron's output would continue to show a trend in this direction for much of his solo career, and his remaining time with the ISB. \"Warm Heart Pastry\" finds Heron backed by Pete Townshend, Keith Moon of The Who, and Ronnie Lane of Small Faces (as Tommy & The Bijoux).

dbr:Taking_a_Line_for_a_Second_Walk	rdf:type	schema:MusicAlbum ;
	dbo:abstract	"Taking a Line for a Second Walk is the name of piano duo reduction of a dance work for orchestra by Michael Nyman, Basic Black, written in 1986 for the Houston Ballet. It is eponymous with a 1994 album on Work Music on which it constitutes approximately half the material. The album is also known as Music for Two Pianos, which is given as the album's name on the back cover and insert back, while Taking a Line for a Second Walk appears on the front cover, spine, and physical disc. The performers are identified on the front cover, and all of the booklet, as The Zoo II, and on the back cover as \"The Zoo Duet\". As one of the tracks on the album is \"Lady in the Red Hat\" from A Zed & Two Noughts, also known as Zoo, this is often seen as a reference to that film. A photograph of the duo is inside the booklet, two young women in black on a black background, leaving only their wedding banded-hands (which form the front cover design) and faces visible, with \"The Zoo II\" as the only caption. The pianists are identified as Helen Hodkinson and Brenda Russell in the Michael Nyman discography on the 1995 promotional compilation Michael Nyman. The album was reissued with a new cover and the Music for Two Pianos title by Signum Records on April 5, 2004 (May 25, 2004 in the U.S.). The artist is listed as \"The Zoo Duet,\" but neither Hodkinson nor Russell are identified by name. This led some reviewers to assume that the piano was played by Nyman himself, using overdubs to play both parts. The title work, which is partially influenced by 1950s rock and roll, takes up the first three tracks of the album (the second and third are identified as \"(untitled)\" in the reissue cover, and simply left blank in the original). The album also contains an expansion of the Water Dances for Peter Greenaway's film about synchronized swimming, Making a Splash, which originally appeared on the album The Kiss and Other Movements. The album's liner notes mention that this latter work invokes a chord progression from a madrigal by Claudio Monteverdi."@en ;

The album was recorded with veteran producer Tony Visconti at Studio Good Earth, London, Studio Rita Mitsouko, Paris and mixed at Studio Good Earth. Receiving positive reviews the album was originally released as an LP, Cassette and CD in September 1986. CD editions include a bonus track. The artwork was designed by Yves M\u00E9ry with photography by Brett Walker. The album was the first of two albums by the duo that Les Rita Mitsouko produced on collaboration with Tony Visconti. Together with Visconti the trio shared production and musician roles regularly swapping and sharing duties across a variety of instruments. Prior to the album the group was simply called Rita Mitsouko. In the interim between the d\u00E9but and 1986's The No Comprendo, Catherine Ringer and Fred Chichin amended their name adding 'Les' to 'Rita Mitsouko'. The decision was made to negate the possibility that audiences would identify the name as referring to Catherine Ringer only as opposed to a musical group."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Tiny Dynamine is an EP by the Scottish rock group Cocteau Twins, released on 4AD Records. The EP featured four non-album tracks. It was issued on 15 November 1985, two weeks prior to another EP, Echoes in a Shallow Bay. The two EP sets, which featured complementary artwork, were also released as a combined double EP in a gatefold cover and as an eight-track CD. The EP was reissued in 1991 as part of The Box Set and in 2005 as part of the singles/EP collection Lullabies to Violaine. The band did not originally intend to release these songs to the general public, presumably explaining the decision to release the material on EPs, rather than as what would have been their fourth album. The tracks on Tiny Dynamine and Echoes in a Shallow Bay were initially recorded to test the production capacities of a new studio. When the band decided the material was strong enough for release, they completed the recording process and issued the finished product on two EPs. \"Pink Orange Red\" and \"Plain Tiger\" were performed live. An acoustic version of \"Pink Orange Red\" appeared on the 1995 EP Twinlights, and a remastered version appeared on the 2000 compilation Stars and Topsoil. Many of the titles on the two EPs seem to have some link with Lepidoptera (butterflies and moths). Most are obscure, but the Plain Tiger is a common Asian butterfly and the lyrics to \"Melonella\" (on Echoes In A Shallow Bay) are simply a recounting of various Lepidopteric family names such as Hesperiidae and Papilionidae."@en ;

The album was originally scheduled to be released on 6/6/06, but the release date was postponed because, according to posts by the band on their forum, promotion had not begun far enough in advance and the parties involved decided to delay the release. Vicious Delicious has a somewhat different sound than that of other Infected Mushroom albums, pleasing some fans and alienating others. The track \"Artillery\" epitomizes this change in sound, being the only hip-hop track on the album, incorporating a somewhat nu metal sound. The rest of the album contains music that can be described as an electronic hybrid of trance, psychedelic, and rock. The song \"Artillery\" was featured in the movie You Don't Mess with the Zohan."@en ;

The album was a subject of friction between DiscReet cofounders Herb Cohen and Frank Zappa. Cohen had used Zappa's royalty checks to fund the album's production, and this led Zappa to withhold the master tapes from Virgin. Beefheart recorded a new album for Warner Bros., Shiny Beast (Bat Chain Puller), with no involvement from Cohen or Zappa.

dbr:Goa_Mix	rdf:type	schema:MusicAlbum ;
	dbo:abstract	"Goa Mix, also known as The Goa Mix, is a two-hour DJ mix by British musician and DJ Paul Oakenfold. It was originally broadcast on BBC Radio 1 as an Essential Mix on 18 December 1994 after the producer of the show, Eddie Gordon, chose Oakenfold to produce an eclectic DJ mix for the show which featured a burgeoning variation of electronic styles, having begun the previous year. Oakenfold had, at this point, developed his own unique goa trance sound, influenced by his time at hippy gatherings on beaches in Goa, and employed it heavily into the mix, which also made pioneering use of film score samples. Oakenfold used the mix an experiment in which he tried to fuse electronic music, especially trance music, as well as film score music, and then to overlay the result with vocal parts, samples and additional production. The mix was split into two parts, later referred to as the Silver Mix and the Gold Mix respectively. Reflecting the Goa influence, the album title did not evolve beyond its simplistic working name. Today Goa Mix is regarded as a ground breaking and a landmark for Oakenfold, Essential Mix and goa trance. It was released as a limited edition album by Cream Records in 1995 and was later reworked by Oakenfold as The Goa Mix 2011 for release in 2010 on New State Music. It was voted the best Essential Mix ever by BBC Radio 1 listeners in 2000 and also won a Silver Award in the Specialist Music Programme category at the 1997 Sony Radio Awards."@en ;

The album's lyrics, titles, and conceptual style are highly critical of the policies of the George W. Bush administration; the CTV website defined it as \"a musical critique of U.S. President George W. Bush and his conduct of the war in Iraq\". Written and recorded over the course of only nine days in March and April 2006, its lyrics are in line with the early 1960s albums of folk artists such as Phil Ochs and Bob Dylan, although they are set to what Young calls \"metal folk protest music\" courtesy of Young, bassist Rick Rosas, drummer Chad Cromwell and trumpet player Tommy Bray. The rhythm section of Cromwell and Rosas and Young's \"Volume Dealers\" co-producer Niko Bolas were also at the core of Young's 1989 album Freedom, which contained an angry criticism of Reagan-George H. W. Bush America. There are other links between the albums: Bray also performed on Freedom and Freedom's hit single \"Rockin' in the Free World\" also contained a quotation of a President Bush: \"a thousand points of light\"."@en ;

Five tracks had already been released as singles in the United Kingdom: \"Bathroom Gurgle\", \"The Bears Are Coming\", \"Space and the Woods\" and \"Focker\" as a double A-side, and \"Heartbeat\". The record peaked at number 28 on the UK Albums Chart, but failed to chart in the United States. The album was recorded in frontman Sam Eastgate's bedroom in Castle Donington, England, and at several locations in London. It went through a fractured creative process that lasted for more than two years. It was eventually produced by Eastgate and DJ Erol Alkan between 2007 and 2008. Fantasy Black Channel does not contain a unifying musical or lyrical theme; rather, it is a collage of all the ideas, genres, and studio effects that fascinated the band members and Alkan, especially during live recording sessions. The record was very well received by critics. It was often treated as one of the best British albums of 2008 because of its eclecticism and spirit of invention."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"For Emma, Forever Ago is the debut studio album by American indie folk band Bon Iver. It was first self-released in July 2007, and later saw wide release on the Jagjaguwar label in February 2008. The album is principally the work of singer-songwriter Justin Vernon, who had previously performed in the band DeYarmond Edison. After college, the group moved to Raleigh, North Carolina, but broke up in 2006. Vernon fell ill with mononucleosis and a liver infection, and grew frustrated with his songwriting and life. He escaped Raleigh and drove an hour northwest of his hometown, Eau Claire, Wisconsin, hoping to be alone. The album was recorded at Vernon's father's remote hunting cabin over the frigid winter of 2006\u201307. He abandoned his old songwriting methods and instead focused on wordless melodies that he later set to words, which he felt evoked a more subconscious meaning. The record's lyrical subjects include lost love and mediocrity. His folk-infused songs include heavy choral arrangements, featuring Vernon's falsetto, and horns. He hunted his own food and spent much of his time isolated. Though he did not intend to make an album, he received strong encouragements from friends and decided to self-release For Emma, Forever Ago in July 2007. After several performances and online exposure, he was signed to Jagjaguwar later that year. For Emma, Forever Ago attracted wide acclaim from music critics, achieving a spot on dozens of end-of-the-year lists, as well as several awards. It became a major commercial success for Jagjaguwar, an independent label, and has been certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), for sales of over 500,000 copies. \"Skinny Love\" became the album's best-performing single and also went gold. Vernon gathered together several musicians to form a band to tour with. The album's touring cycle lasted two years, ending in late 2009, and visited several countries and music festivals worldwide."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"In Person Friday and Saturday Nights at the Blackhawk, Complete, also called The Complete Blackhawk, is a 2003 four-disc collection of the 1961 live performances of the Miles Davis Quintet at the Black Hawk nightclub in San Francisco. These sets, performed with recording in mind, forged new ground for jazz musician Miles Davis, who had never previously been recorded live in a club with his combo. Material from the four sets was first released simultaneously by Columbia Records on two albums in September 1961, titled In Person Friday Night at the Blackhawk, San Francisco, Volume 1 and In Person Saturday Night at the Blackhawk, San Francisco, Volume 2. Although those albums were subsequently rereleased several times, the complete sets were not commercially available until Sony Records realised a digital mastering of this collection. Simultaneous to this release, the material was made available as two separate double-albums, entitled Friday Night: In Person at the Blackhawk in San Francisco, Complete and Saturday Night: In Person at the Blackhawk in San Francisco, Complete. The complete collection, which included liner notes from the original release by Monterey Jazz Festival co-founder Ralph J. Gleason as well as additional notes by jazz trumpeter Eddie Henderson, was critically and commercially well received. The collection peaked at #9 on Billboard's \"Top Jazz Albums\" chart."@en ;

Crystal Chronicles, Ring of Fates, and Echoes of Time have had released soundtrack albums to date, and Crystal Chronicles and Ring of Fates each have an associated single. Kumi Tanioka is the main composer for the series, having composed the three released soundtracks as well as the music for My Life as a King and My Life as a Darklord. Hidenori Iwasaki is filling that role for The Crystal Bearers. Nobuo Uematsu, the main composer for the regular Final Fantasy series, contributed one track to the Ring of Fates soundtrack. Yae and Donna Burke sang the Japanese and English versions of the theme song for Crystal Chronicles, respectively, while Aiko sang the theme song for Ring of Fates. Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles Original Soundtrack was released by Pony Canyon in 2003, as was its single, \"Kaze no Ne\", and a promotional album Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles - A Musical Journey. Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles: Ring of Fates Original Soundtrack and the double A-side \"Hoshi no Nai Sekai\"/\"Yokogao\" were released by Pony Canyon in 2007.

It has since continued across multiple platforms, from the Super Nintendo Entertainment System to the PlayStation 2, and like the Final Fantasy series, the story in each SaGa game is independent of its counterparts. The music of the SaGa series consists of musical scores and arranged albums from various composers. Some of these composers have created soundtracks and pieces for other Square Enix franchises including the Final Fantasy series and Mana series. The SaGa series is divided up between the original series, released as the Final Fantasy Legend series in North America, the Romancing SaGa series, the SaGa Frontier series, and Unlimited SaGa. The music of the original series was composed by Nobuo Uematsu, Kenji Ito, Ryuji Sasai, and Chihiro Fujioka. Ito went on to be the composer for the Romancing SaGa series, with each arranged album from the series arranged by a different artist off of Ito's work. Ito composed the soundtrack for the first game of the SaGa Frontier series, but was replaced by Masashi Hamauzu for the second game of the series and Unlimited SaGa. Music from the original soundtracks of the SaGa games has been arranged as sheet music for the piano and published by DOREMI Music Publishing, while tracks from Romancing SaGa Minstrel Song were played at the Press Start -Symphony of Games- 2006 concert and Extra: Hyper Game Music Event 2007 concert in Tokyo and a piece from SaGa Frontier 2 was played at the fifth Symphonic Game Music Concert, held in Leipzig, Germany on August 22, 2007."@en ;

The album consists of live recordings from his sold-out June 14\u201315, 2006 tribute concerts at Carnegie Hall to the legendary American actress and singer Judy Garland. Backed by a 36-piece orchestra conducted by Stephen Oremus, Wainwright recreated Garland's April 23, 1961 concert, often considered \"the greatest night in show business history\". Garland's 1961 double album, Judy at Carnegie Hall, a comeback performance with more than 25 American pop and jazz standards, was highly successful, initially spending 95 weeks on the Billboard charts and garnering five Grammy Awards (including Album of the Year, Best Album Cover, Best Solo Vocal Performance \u2013 Female and Best Engineering Contribution \u2013 Popular Recording). For his album, Wainwright was also recognized by the Grammy Awards, earning a 2009 nomination for Best Traditional Pop Vocal Album. While the tribute concerts were popular and the album was well received by critics, album sales were limited. Rufus Does Judy at Carnegie Hall managed to chart in three nations, peaking at number 84 in Belgium, number 88 in the Netherlands and number 171 on the United States' Billboard 200. Guests on the album include Wainwright's sister Martha Wainwright (\"Stormy Weather\"), his mother Kate McGarrigle (piano, \"Over the Rainbow\"), along with one of Garland's daughters, Lorna Luft (\"After You've Gone\"). Related to the album, the February 25, 2007 tribute concert filmed at the London Palladium was released on DVD as Rufus! Rufus! Rufus! Does Judy! Judy!

The mix was completed as a promotional piece for the Nike + Human Race, a tenth anniversary running event, which took place on 31 August 2008. The mix includes various hip-hop and electro tracks, composed and produced by A-Trak and mixed in one continuous piece. \"Making a 45-minute piece was interesting in terms of arrangement,\" A-Trak said in a short video interview, which is available at the official project's site. \"Here, a guy is running and it's all about pacing. You want to keep him in the zone, you want to keep his attention, but at the same time there's much more room to spread out than on a record I might produce for a club.\" Simultaneously with releasing the album at the Nike+ Sportmusic section of the iTunes Store, the promotional website was launched.

	dbo:abstract	"Weather and Water is a 2005 studio album by the Austin, Texas progressive bluegrass band The Greencards. Their second Dualtone album release of 2005, after their debut 2003 album Movin' On was re-released earlier in the year by their label Dualtone Records, Weather and Water was released on June 28. In a review of Weather and Water in The Washington Post, it was noted that on this album, unlike their debut, the focus was on the music supporting lyrics, rather than the blues virtuosity of Movin' On. In another review, Jim Abbott of the Tribune News Service described The Greencards as polished, \"earthy, charming roots music with a sophisticated sheen\", but noted that some bluegrass purists may miss the vocal idiosyncrasies that can be found on other bluegrass bands such as the Del McCoury Band. All three members of the band sing on Weather and Water, but Young's voice was noted for its \"dreamy, haunting quality\". Their music through the Weather and Water album had been called Celtic-influenced and bluegrass-flavored, but noted that the band had a distinctly American sound despite their overseas origins. Jason Gonulsen of Glide Magazine noted that The Greencards' debut Movin' On didn't capture the band's live energy, but that Weather and Water overcame this, and was one of 2005's best bluegrass albums. In the wake of their release, the band was nominated in the Americana Music Association Awards for 2006 in the category of New/Emerging Artist of the Year, winning the award. The music video for the band's single \"Time\" from Weather and Water received heavy airplay and rotation on Country Music Television. \"Time\" was described as the centerpiece track of Weather and Water. Country Music Television named Weather and Water one of the ten favorite bluegrass albums of the year, saying, \"At the nexus of bluegrass, country and pop, this charming trio immediately win over such diverse audiences in concert. Luckily, their winning personality translates to this disc -- even with several melancholy, yet melodic, songs. Not for nothing did Bob Dylan and Willie Nelson choose them to open their summer tour of minor league ballparks.\" The Greencards were the opening act for Dylan and Nelson on their 2005 summer tour. Kym Warner credits Gary Paczosa, an engineer that worked on Weather and Water, with helping them getting the opportunity to tour with Dylan and Nelson. Paczosa had previously served as an engineer on recordings for Alison Krauss, Nickel Creek and Dolly Parton. \"He makes the best-sounding acoustic records in the world\", according to Warner. During their tour with Dylan and Nelson, Buzz McClain of The Washington Post observed that The Greencards plays traditional American music due to their deep respect for the material than most American musicians do. Throughout 2005, they toured extensively with Dylan and Nelson, and afterwards toured with Tommy Emmanuel. Coinciding with their move to Nashville in late 2005, and work on their second album Weather and Water, it was seen as a deliberate move from the jam-style of their debut album Movin' On to instead focus on Americana-focused music. During the 2005 summer tour, Kym Warner wanted to get the chance to pick Dylan's brain, but never had the chance. Warner did not get to spend much time with him, but Dylan told him at the end of the tour, \u201CYou\u2019ll be fine from now on.\u201D"@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Silent Cry is the sixth full studio album by rock band Feeder. It was released by Echo, on 16 June 2008, on CD, deluxe CD, vinyl, and digital download. It was the follow-up to 2005's Pushing the Senses and in terms of all albums, the highly successful singles album in 2006. The first single, \"We Are the People\", preceded the album, being released on 9 June. It was the last album to feature Mark Richardson on Drums before departing in 2009. The album was recorded at the Crypt Studios in North London, England, with the help of long-time friend of the band Matt Sime. Like their 1999 album Yesterday Went Too Soon, the album was self-produced. Three tracks (\"We Are the People\", \"Itsumo\" and \"Fires\") feature backing vocals by Sarah Clark- bassist and backing vocals singer with Bang Bangs, a project signed to Sime's publishing company Black Circle. Despite the problems that occurred behind the scenes at the band's then record label Echo, which resulted in their dissolution, the album managed to reach #3 on the UK iTunes album chart, and debuted at #8 in the official UK Albums Chart, but still became their first ever album not to go silver. The song \"Miss You\" is also credited to being featured on the video game Midnight Club: Los Angeles. The album's second and final single, \"Tracing Lines / Silent Cry\", was released on 25 August as a download only, but failed to chart."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Sir Lucious Left Foot: The Son of Chico Dusty is the debut studio album by American rapper Big Boi, released on July 5, 2010, by Purple Ribbon Records and Def Jam Recordings. It is his first solo album as a member of hip hop duo OutKast. Production for the album took place primarily at Stankonia Recording Studio in Atlanta during 2007 to 2010 and was handled by several record producers, including Organized Noize, Scott Storch, Salaam Remi, Mr. DJ, and Andr\u00E9 3000, among others. The album's development was impeded by a dispute between Big Boi and his former label, Jive Records, over creative and commercial differences. Rooted in Southern hip hop, Sir Lucious Left Foot has been noted by music writers for its bounce and bass-heavy sound, layered production, and assorted musical elements. Its lyrics deal with boasting, sex, social commentary, and club themes, featuring Big Boi's clever wordplay and versatile flow. Following a heavily delayed release, the album debuted at number three on the US Billboard 200, selling 62,000 copies in its first week, and spent 13 weeks on the chart. It also charted internationally and produced two singles, including the UK top-40 hit \"Shutterbugg\". Sir Lucious Left Foot received rave reviews from music critics, who praised its varied sound and Big Boi's lyricism, and was included in numerous year-end top albums lists. Big Boi promoted the album with an international tour in 2010. As of September 2010, it has sold 175,000 copies in the United States."@en ;

Their first, Tales from the Elvenpath, was considered incomplete by many fans as it contains only tracks from Oceanborn, Over the Hills and Far Away, Wishmaster and Century Child, leaving out Angels Fall First. This compilation, though, contains songs from all previously released Nightwish albums, plus a cover of Pink Floyd's \"High Hopes\" (live version on the limited edition). Highest Hopes was released in three different formats: Standard, Special Edition and Extended 2 CD. In addition to the normal version, a special edition was released, omitting the song \"Deep Silent Complete\" and replacing it with the popular cover version of The Phantom of the Opera theme, it also contains a bonus DVD containing three full songs filmed live at the Mera Luna Festival in Hildesheim, Germany in 2003. The Extended Version is a 2-CD compilation with CD1 the same as the Standard Version plus a 2nd CD of eight audio tracks from the Tarja Turunen period and includes a bonus DVD containing ten video tracks; Three full songs ( Tracks 1-3 ) filmed live at the M'era Luna Festival in Hildesheim, Germany in 2003 ( Identical to the Special Edition Bonus DVD but in an altered running order), three studio videos ( Tracks 4-6 ) and a further four full live songs (Tracks 7-10 ) filmed live at the Summer Breeze Festival in Germany in 2002 . All versions feature a new (2005) recording of the song \"Sleeping Sun\" and a live version of Pink Floyd's \"High Hopes\" from which this compilation takes its name. The album was certified platinum in Finland \u2013 for sales exceeding 40,000 copies \u2013 the same day it was released, and also was gold in Norway with more than 20,000 sold copies. It was also Finland's best-selling album of 2005, having sold more than 65,000 copies, certified with double platinum. Today, it has sold more than 103,000 copies."@en ;

Music from the game has been released in several albums. The main soundtrack album, Final Fantasy XIII Original Soundtrack, was released on four Compact Discs in 2010 by Square Enix, the developers and producers of the game. Selections from the soundtrack have been released on two gramophone record albums, W/F: Music from Final Fantasy XIII and W/F: Music from Final Fantasy XIII Gentle Reveries, both in 2010 by Square Enix. An album of arranged pieces from the soundtrack, Final Fantasy XIII Original Soundtrack -PLUS-, was also released by Square Enix in 2010, as was an album of piano arrangements, Piano Collection Final Fantasy XIII. The theme song for the Japanese version of the game, \"Kimi ga Iru Kara\" (\u541B\u304C\u3044\u308B\u304B\u3089 \"Because You're Here\"), was released as a single by For Life Music in 2009. The soundtrack received good reviews from critics, who felt that it was Hamauzu's best work to date and an excellent mix of material and genres which took the series' music in a new direction. The \"Plus\" album received weaker reviews, primarily due to its perceived lack of tracks that were significantly different from those in the original soundtrack album, while \"Kimi ga Iru Kara\" was considered bland and disappointing. The \"Piano\" album's reception was split between critics who felt that the tracks did not deviate enough from the original pieces and those who felt that the straightforward arrangements were sophisticated. Music from the game was played at a live orchestral concert in Stockholm, Sweden, and was added to the permanent rotation of the international Distant Worlds concert series, while tracks from the piano album have been played in concerts in Japan and Paris."@en ;

Distributed initially as a covermount with the nationwide Real News on 28 March, it sold 140 thousand copies via the aforementioned and the retail release, making it the most widely distributed release of her career; however, it remains her lowest-selling studio album to date in official retail copies, with sales of 12,960. Its singles also performed more moderately compared to her previous albums, with \"Tha 'Mai Allios\", \"An Isouna Agapi\", and \"Girna Me Sto Htes\" managing to reach the top ten of the domestic charts.To promote the album Paparizou performed on several television programs and embarked on a joint national tour with the band Onirama called Fisika Mazi. She also performed a revue show at Diogenis Studio, supporting Antonis Remos. Dedicated to Paparizou's father who died in 2008, the album's production team and musical direction were fairly similar to that of Vrisko To Logo Na Zo. However, while the influence of pop-rock sounds continued, the album is much more rooted in pop production than its predecessor, re-embracing Paparizou's previous dance-pop and pop-folk styles.

The album's first official single, \"Within My Heart\", was released on May 16, 2011 as an EP containing two additional tracks to be featured on the album. The second single, \"Calling\", was released on September 4 with an accompanying music video released October 6. The third single, \"Lost\", was released on September 19, 2011, following the delay of the \"Calling\" music video. Like the band's debut album, Incomparable included re-recorded demos as well as brand new tracks. On their debut album, only two out of 16 tracks were new, and the 14 others were re-recorded demo songs. Incomparable, however, has only one re-done demo (which is one of their earliest written tunes: \"Lost\") while the other 12 songs on the standard edition are new. Two other songs, \"Painting Shadows\" and \"Unhateable\", were also remade during the production of the album; the former was made the bonus track and the latter did not make it on the track list but was featured on the B-side of \"Within My Heart\". Incomparable charted at number two on the Swedish Albums Charts. Pontus Hjelm (who left the band in 2010) had returned to write and play guitar for the album after the other guitarist Johan Olsson quit. Like their previous album all songs were written by Hjelm with most co-written by Jimmie Strimell. Strimell was the only band member to contribute to the songwriting."@en ;

He produced the album with Christopher \"Tricky\" Stewart and Los Da Mystro. It expands on the suite-like production style and lyrical themes of The-Dream's previous albums. His lyrics are characterized by arrogance and swagger, and deal with traditional R&B themes such as love, sex, money, and infidelity. Love King has been noted by music writers for its layered musical elements, detailed production, arrogant lyrics, and themes of love, money, sex, and infidelity. The album debuted at number four on the US Billboard 200 chart, selling 58,000 copies in its first week. It produced two singles that achieved minimal Billboard chart success, \"Love King\" and \"Make Up Bag\". Upon its release, Love King received generally positive reviews from music critics, who praised The-Dream's detailed production and complimented his sexual-themed and boastful lyrics.

Co-produced by Samy Bishai, it was inspired by the poems of Indian poet Rabindranath Tagore. In addition to original works, it also contains covers of Fran\u00E7oise Hardy and Nick Drake songs. The album also features composers Zoe Rahman and Jocelyn Pook. The album features audio clips from non-commercial film director, and activist Peter Joseph and self-educated industrial engineer and futurist Jacque Fresco through multiple tracks, as well as references to Zeitgeist: Addendum and a resource-based economy. Derek Beres named Mounqaliba on his list of the Top 12 Records of 2010 and Siddhartha Mitter listed it as one of his top 10 world music CDs of 2010. Contrary to these views, The Guardian music reviewer Robin Denselow gave the album 2.5 stars in his review; citing purposeful limitation of her vocal range, reliance upon \"an easygoing swirl of Arabic-tinged strings and jazz-edged piano\" and \"[being] annoyingly interspersed with spoken 'interludes' [by Joseph and others]\" as the reason for the rating. In February 2011 Atlas and Basha Beats issued a remix of \"Makaan\" and \"Batkallim\" called \"Egypt: Rise to Freedom\" to commemorate the Egyptian Revolution of 2011. A download only album of \"River Man\" remixes was released by Six Degrees Records in 2010. The album features 4 remixes of \"River Man\" by 310, Jef Stot and Makyo as well as Atlas' original version that appeared on Mounqaliba.

	dbo:abstract	"My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy is the fifth studio album by American hip hop recording artist Kanye West, released on November 22, 2010, by Roc-A-Fella Records. Following a period of public and legal controversy, West retreated to a \"self-imposed exile\" in Hawaii in 2009. There, he worked on the album in a communal recording environment that involved a variety of musicians and producers, many of whom contributed to the music. Noted by critics for its maximalist aesthetic, opulent production quality, and dichotomous themes, My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy incorporates aspects of West's previous works, including soul, baroque, electro, and symphonic styles. The album deals with themes of excess and celebrity, and explores such issues as consumer culture, race, and the idealism of the American Dream. To promote My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy, West released free songs through his GOOD Fridays series and four singles: the Billboard hits \"Power\", \"Monster\", and \"Runaway\", and the international hit \"All of the Lights\". It was also promoted with a short film set to the record's music, Runaway. The album debuted at number one on the Billboard 200. It was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America and had sold 1,032,000 copies in the US by 2013. My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy received widespread critical acclaim and was also named the best record of 2010 in numerous critics' polls and year-end lists."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"My Dinosaur Life is the fourth studio album by the American rock band Motion City Soundtrack. Produced by Mark Hoppus, the album was released on January 19, 2010 by Columbia Records. After many years on independent label Epitaph Records, Motion City Soundtrack signed to major label Columbia in 2006, prior to the release of their third album, Even If It Kills Me (2007). Blink-182 bassist Mark Hoppus returned to produce the album; he had previously worked with the band on their 2005 breakthrough Commit This to Memory. The album was largely recorded at Opra Music Studios in North Hollywood, California. The album's themes largely center on growing older; its lyricism, written by Pierre, concerns such subjects as relationships, drug abuse, and procrastination. Musically, the album retains the band's sound with less of an emphasis on the Moog synthesizer. Drummer Tony Thaxton broke his arm prior to recording, which led the band to use a drum machine on early recordings. Their only major-label release, My Dinosaur Life was well-received by music critics. The album represented their highest peak position in the U.S., charting at number fifteen on the Billboard 200. In support of the album, the group toured worldwide, making appearances in the U.S., the United Kingdom, Australia, and Japan."@en ;

Upon release, Neuromance received positive reviews and has sold out of both the standard edition and the two disc Digipak. Critics consistently praised the quick pace of the tracks and aggressive vocals provided by Victor Love. In addition, critics pointed out the tracks \"10.000 Watts\" and \"Theta Titanium\" as being some of the best tracks on the album for different reasons.

	dbo:abstract	"Rock 'n' Roll Circus is the eleventh studio album by Japanese recording artist Ayumi Hamasaki. It was released on April 14, 2010 by Avex Trax. It was also released just a little over a year after her 2009 album, Next Level. Rock 'n' Roll Circus marks Hamasaki's eleventh consecutive album to be fully produced by Japanese producer and manager Max Matsuura, while she contributes to the album as the lead vocalist, background vocalist, and songwriter to all songs. Recorded in Japanese with minor phrases in English, Rock 'n' Roll Circus is a rock album with numerous musical elements such as electropop, J-pop, J-rock, pop ballad, and dance music. Rock 'n' Roll Circus was recorded in Japan and the United Kingdom, making it Hamasaki's first album recorded outside of her native country. Additional production was handled in the United States and the two prior countries. Five different formats were released to promote the album; a standalone CD, a CD and DVD bundle, a limited edition box set, a limited edition Playbutton, and a digital release worldwide. Two different artworks were issued for the album's cover sleeve; one has Hamasaki inside a telephone box, while the second sleeve has a close-up of Hamasaki's face. Upon the album's release, it was met with mixed to favourable reviews from music critics. Critics commended the album's approach to rock music, alongside its commercial appeal and music consistency. However, some noted the lack of emotional delivery in Hamasaki's lyrics, while criticizing the album's ballads and production. Rock 'n' Roll Circus was listed by several critics as one of the best albums of 2010. Commercially, Rock 'n' Roll Circus was a success. It became Hamasaki's tenth album to reach the top spot on Japan's Oricon Albums Chart, and was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of Japan (RIAJ) for shipments of 250,000 units. The album charted on Korea's Gaon Album Chart and Taiwan's G-Music Albums Chart. Two singles were released from Rock 'n' Roll Circus, including one promotional. Its lead a-side single \"Sunrise/Sunset (Love Is All)\" was a commercial success, peaking at number one on the Japanese Oricon Singles Chart and two on the Japan Hot 100 chart. The albums second and final a-side single, \"You Were.../Ballad\", was a commercial success; it peaked at number one on the Japanese Oricon Singles Chart and 14 on the Japan Hot 100 chart. The album's only promotional single, \"Microphone\", reached number 33 on the RIAJ Digital Track Chart. Several other album tracks charted on competent charts in Japan. Hamasaki promoted the album on her 2010 Rock 'n' Roll Circus tour."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Something for the Rest of Us is the ninth studio album by American rock band Goo Goo Dolls. It was released on August 28, 2010 in Australia and on August 31 in North America through Warner Bros. Records. The recording process took place during the spring to fall of 2009 in the GCR Audio studio in Buffalo and Paramount Studios as well as \"the Ark\" in Los Angeles, with producer Tim Palmer. A single had been originally slated to be released in November 2009 with an album release in February 2010, but the band went back into the studio in January 2010. According to lead singer and guitarist John Rzeznik, this was done to make further improvements on what they had previously thought had been a finished record. Several producers were brought in to assist on the production process, including Butch Vig, John Fields, Paul David Hager and Rob Cavallo. Something for the Rest of Us is the third Goo Goo Dolls studio album that Cavallo has produced (Dizzy Up the Girl and Gutterflower). When asked about the length of time between albums, Rzeznik admitted it was a mix of songwriting issues as well as taking time out for personal reasons; \"I wanted to really dig deep and there are a million songs I threw away, like, \u201CNah, it's not good enough. I wanna do something different. I wanna do something better, go deeper. I also wanted to have a life with my girlfriend for a while. I owed it to her to spend some time with her and be normal and be in one place. That was kind of important.\" In one of the Ustream sessions, Robby revealed that the album will have 12 songs and \"Real\" is not among them. In late May, John announced that \"Home\" would be the first single and was released onto radio and iTunes stores on June 8, 2010. On July 13, 2010, it was announced on the band's fan club website, Inner Machine, that an EP will be available to purchase at all remaining tour dates. The EP is titled Waiting for the Rest of It and it contains 4 new songs from Something for the Rest of Us plus a live recording of \"Broadway\" from the Something for the Rest of Us Tour."@en ;

The set won critical acclaim for its dark and complex production, with the band employing unorthodox techniques such as sudden and abrupt time signature shifts, coupled with frequent use of \"irrational\" measure lengths. The production also utilized the use of intricate musical arrangements, with several songs on the album, such as \"Sets the Blaze\", \"Thinking Like That\", \"Trouble\" and \"Blue Bird\", featuring no discernible choruses. A cover of the Syd Barrett track \"Golden Hair\", from his 1970 album The Madcap Laughs, was released with the March 2010 issue of Mojo magazine. Originally an acoustic song set to the words of James Joyce's poem \"Lean Out of the Window\", the track was radically altered and rearranged into a psychedelic rock piece, extending the originals duration from under two-minutes to over 6:30. On August 10, 2010, the song was released as a non-album single, backed with the b-side \"Suddenly Beside You.\" The track served as the closing encore for every Warm Inventions show since its release."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Zounds is the third album by Dappled Cities, released in 2009 through Dangerbird Records. The album comes two years after their previous release, Granddance, during which time the band was touring the US with the likes of The Fratellis and Tokyo Police Club, with a few forays home riding shotgun to Silverchair, Modest Mouse and LCD Soundsystem. At this point, the band had uprooted from their home of Sydney and settled Stateside. They shot videos in Wyoming gas stations, played impromptu gigs in South Dakota sound factories, partied with Hugh Jackman and Steve Malkmus and even managed to film a 26-episode children\u2019s odyssey for Disney called \u2018Alphabreaks\u2019. Under the expert A&R guidance of Justin Meldal-Johnsen (Beck, Ladytron, Nine Inch Nails) and respected American co-producer Chris Coady (TV on the Radio), Dappled Cities got busy making music. The band spared no expense, using new-fangled electric guitars and importing a Gakken \u2014 a $40 build-it-yourself cardboard synthesiser from Japan \u2014 used on all 12 songs. Their drive to succeed saw them hire and conspire with no less than three mixers for Zounds \u2014 Coady, Scott Horscroft and Wayne Connolly \u2014 in the quest for perfection. The result: \"It's an album that really shows the growth and depth of Dappled Cities. Zounds is both grand and emotive and full of euphoric melodies and unique story-telling.\""@en ;

The photos of car accidents in the CD booklet proved prophetic, as this lineup of Don Caballero disbanded after being involved in a van accident while touring in support of American Don.

The other contributions come from Lord Finesse (who also produced on both of the two previous albums) and Ahmed who OC previously worked together with on the self-titled D.I.T.C. album released in 2000. Guest appearances are as usual kept to a minimum on Bon Appetit and in the family as A.G., The Ghetto Dwellas and A Bless appears on one track each. Two rappers by the name of UNI and TL, who still remains unknown to this day, trades verses with O on the title track and rap-heavyweight Jay-Z perform the hook on the hidden bonus track \"Bonafide\" (originally released in 1999 on a limited 12\" single). The album was met with very mixed reviews some claimed it to be a case of OC selling out and dumbing down his lyrics while other publications like HipHopDX.com called it \"what might be the strongest album in his career). The sound is much more polished from the classic Word...Life and Jewelz and incorporates a bit of a commercial touch in its places although none of the records were big radio hits. Time has been good to Bon Appetit and has gained more fans over the years though and OC who was once asked in an interview if he regretted making the album answered that he did not at all, quite the opposite actually. He said that Bon Appetit was a main force in bringing the soul and funk samples back into hip-hop, which (according to Credle) inspired Jay-Z to record his hailed album The Blueprint. The European version of the CD includes two extra bonus tracks at the end; \"Half Good, Half Sinner\" (which was released as a 12\" in the US prior to the album's release with a sticker saying \"from the forthcoming OC album on JCOR Records) and the previously unreleased \"Ex-O-Cise (No Hook Theory)\".
