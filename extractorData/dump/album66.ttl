British journalist David Wigg interviewed the individual Beatles at various points from December 1968 or January 1969 to December 1973, and excerpts from some of these recordings constitute the album's spoken words. Although he was a columnist (\"Young London\") for the London newspaper The Evening News, the interviews were intended for broadcast on BBC Radio 1's Scene and Heard. Interspersed among the interview excerpts are instrumental performances of Beatles songs, played by other musicians. The Beatles tried to prevent the album's publication, but it was released in the United Kingdom on 30 July 1976 under the Polydor label (catalogue number 2683 068) and in the United States in 1978."@en ;

This album marked a change for the band, drifting more to bluesy rock and abandoning from their classic hardcore thrash style. Released during the grunge era, Beow\u00FClf achieved small success with the album in Los Angeles and the band had gathered some following. Un-Sentimental was the first new album since the band ended with a temporary break up in the early 1990s. Dale Henderson, the band's founder and chief songwriter, is the only original member appearing on the album. Therefore, many purists object to it being called \"Beow\u00FClf\" or simply \"BWF\" and consider it to be a Dale Henderson solo project. According to Henderson, Mike Jensen (guitar), Paul Yamada (bass) and Michael Alvarado (drums) all declined the invitation to reunite. The album had no singles, but a music video for \"P.O.W. (Pissed Off White Boy)\" was made. Like many Beow\u00FClf albums, the recording is out of print."@en ;

The album's first single, \"Everything Is Borrowed\", was released on 29 September 2008. In the months leading up to the album's release, \"The Escapist\" was offered online as a free download, accompanied by a music video. The video (directed by Ted Mayhem) follows Skinner as he walks 770 miles from Dover to a beach in France, a feat Skinner actually undertook. \"Who Knows Who\", a track Skinner recorded with the band Muse, was leaked in August 2008 and was initially believed by many to be a track from the upcoming album, until refuted by Muse. During the recording of the album, Skinner states that he \"threw away more music than is on the album now,\" as he was unhappy with the material recorded, but that \"the album is a product of all the stuff I threw away, it was important to the album.\" Everything Is Borrowed is the penultimate album from The Streets; Skinner has said that he signed a five-record deal, and that he always envisioned a five-album box set. Eight music videos were made for the album, culminating with \"On the Edge of a Cliff\" being released on 7 April 2009 (videos were not made for \"The Sherry End\", \"Alleged Legends\" and \"The Strongest Person I Know\")."@en ;

The album has essential participation of the renowned pianist Tigran Hamasyan, flautist Valeri Tolstov, and trumpet player Tom Duprey. It also features additional performances from Stewart Copeland and actor/musician Davis Alpay and Vincent Pedulla. This is a curious album in Tankian's discography, because only 4 of the 15 tracks features Serj's vocals. All the other tracks are instrumental, except for \"End of Time\", which features a female vocalist. According to Tankian, Jazz-Iz-Christ is \"a combination. There's some classic jazz, dance-y stuff, and progressive things. It's all over the place, but it's jazz instrument-wise. It's for a modern listener who appreciates jazz overtones.\""@en ;

The album debuted on the Billboard Canadian Albums Chart the week of October 15, 2011, at number nine. The album is the follow-up to 2009's Nice, Nice, Very Nice, which was short-listed for the Polaris Prize. In contrast to its predecessor's sparse acoustic guitar, Oh Fortune relies more often on fuller orchestral arrangements, described by Now Magazine's Carla Gillis as \"expansive, epic orchestral indie rock\". It has also been described as having a darker emotional and lyrical tone, comparable to its namesake poem \"O Fortuna\", without becoming too grim. David Berry of the National Post describes the album's theme as \"a kind of bald appraisal of the situation that packs it full of so much more \u2014 meaning, weight, beauty, humour \u2014 than your typical singer-songwriter\u2019s over-emotive pigeonholing\". At the 2012 Juno Awards, Mangan received the award for Alternative Album of the Year for Oh Fortune."@en ;

The album contains a selection of the most requested songs from her \"all-male hits special\" weekly acoustic radio show of the same title, which aired on Wave 89.1 during Friday and Sunday evenings. The idea and concept of the project came from Nina herself, and she approached the station's manager to carry it out. She is co-executive producer of the album, with Warner head manager Jim Baluyut, and produced all the tracks herself (a first time for the singer). All the tracks are the actual recordings from Nina's Renditions of the Soul radio sessions. Upon release, the album received positive response from music critics who stated that Nina's voice fits perfectly to each song. In 2010, she won Best Female Recording Artist on the Box Office Entertainment Awards, where the Guillermo Mendoza Memorial Scholarship Foundation named her as the best-selling female recording artist of 2009\u2014having sold 100,000 copies of her Nina Live!, Nina Sings the Hits of Diane Warren and Renditions of the Soul albums. Additionally, the album was surprisingly a commercial hit. Despite having the least promotion, it managed to reach Platinum by the Philippine Association of the Record Industry (PARI) in July 2010, denoting 20,000 units sold. In December 2010, it became one of the best-sellers in the country during Christmas season. Three singles were released from the album. \"She's Out of My Life\" was the first official single. It did not have a music video to be solicited to music channels, and therefore, lacked promotion. The second single was \"Cold Summer Nights\", originally recorded by Francis Magalona. Like the first single, it was not given enough promotion, but it managed to pick up airplay on TV and radio. \"I'm Yours\" was released as the third and last single off the album. Unlike the two releases, it had a music video that came up from Warner's Nina sing-along contest. Since, Nina has left the label during the time, she had no participation on the video's release."@en ;

With Kahne, he experimented in this new album with new arrangements and even using some percussion instruments, although in his earlier material, he had tried to stay away from such usage, saying they were too loud. The result is still acoustic and melodic but with \"some additional texture to it\" as he put it in an interview with Instinct magazine The track \"Greatest Hits\" was the pre-release and first official single release from the forthcoming album. Brannan released the track \"Beautifully\" as a second official single from the album to coincide with the release of the album, accompanied by an official video release directed by Grant Carden and Dillon Mangrann-Wells.

	dbo:abstract	"Soul Finger is the debut album of the Bar-Kays, issued three months after the single of the same name. It was recorded by Tom Dowd and Chris Huston on Friday, June 23, 1967, at the Stax studio in Memphis. Though all but one member of the group were black (Ronnie Caldwell being the only white member), the album cover art, by Loring Eutemey, suggests an interracial pop music party feeling. The instrumental band, after being signed in early 1967, enjoyed tutoring by Al Jackson, Jr. and the other members of Booker T. & the M.G.'s, which shows in the tightness of the rhythm section. That summer they also were selected by Otis Redding as his new backup band."@en ;

In Singapore, the album sold 600,000 copies and still holds record as Singapore's best selling album in any repertoire. In Malaysia, the album is said to had sold more than half million copies, and continues to hold the record for the best-selling non-English international album there (by comparison, Malaysia's highest selling album sold more than 700,000 copies). In 2003, Michael Learns to Rock covered the title track, \"Goodbye Kiss\", in English and released it as \"Take Me To Your Heart\".

	dbo:abstract	"Live at the Opera is the first live album by the Norwegian black metal band Satyricon, originally released in 2015 under the Austrian label Napalm Records. It consists of a digipak with two CD and one bonus DVD on limited edition, both with the same songs. Additionally, the album was released in a special edition of three vinyl records. Basically it contains the most tracks from the album Satyricon (2013) and a compilation of some of the best known Satyricon songs from previous albums. In February 2015, the frontman Satyr explained how the concept (new label, new DVD) came together: \u201CThe whole thing started with us doing one song, 'To The Mountains' a year and a half before the actual show. We performed at a closed event in the main hall of the opera with the Royal Norwegian Opera Chorus. It was very inspirational. I then said to the conductor that I would love to do a whole show like this. He loved the idea, I was serious about it, and he was serious about it.\u201D Live at the Opera comes from a nearly two-hour special live performance, which was shot and edited on DVD. The exclusive show was held on September 8, 2013 at the Oslo Opera House (Operahuset) in Norway, as part of the Ultima Oslo Contemporary Music Festival held annually. It presents the outstanding participation of 55 singers from the Norwegian National Opera Chorus (Operakoret). The album peaked at #26 on the Norwegian charts VG-lista and peaked at #56 in German charts."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Hasta la Ra\u00EDz ([\u02C8asta la ra\u02C8is], \"Down to the Root\") is the sixth studio album by Mexican recording artist Natalia Lafourcade. It was released on March 17, 2015, by Sony Music Latin. After the success of her previous album, Mujer Divina, a tribute to Mexican singer-songwriter Agust\u00EDn Lara, Lafourcade decided to record an album with original recordings. Lafourcade spent three years writing the songs and searching for inspiration in different cities, resulting in songs that express very personal feelings regarding love. The record was produced by Lafourcade, with the assistance of Argentinian musician Cachorro L\u00F3pez and Mexican artist Leonel Garc\u00EDa. Upon its release, Hasta la Ra\u00EDz received favorable reviews from music critics, with some critics expressing skepticism about her songwriting and saying she had stayed within her comfort zone, and others praising her evolution as a musician and naming the album one of the best pop releases of the year. The record peaked at number eight on the US Billboard Latin Albums and number one in Mexico, where it was certified platinum, with over 60,000 copies shipped in the country. Hasta la Ra\u00EDz received a nomination for Album of the Year and won Best Alternative Music Album and Best Engineered Album at the 16th Latin Grammy Awards. The album also won Best Latin Rock, Urban or Alternative Album at the 58th Annual Grammy Awards. To promote the album, three singles were released, and Lafourcade launched the 2015 Hasta la Ra\u00EDz Tour to several Latin American countries, the United States, and Europe. The album's first two singles, the title track and \"Nunca Es Suficiente\" reached the top five in Mexico."@en ;

It is mostly drawn from his work during 1984-1991. \"Real Real Gone\" from the 1990 album Enlightenment was the only song included that was a fairly successful single. The other songs were not well known except for among longtime fans. They were a good example of his more idiosyncratic material that had been prevalent during this period when his work was mostly about spiritual searches for fulfillment. But also included were a 1960s Them cover of John Lee Hooker's \"Don't Look Back\" and \"It's All Over Now, Baby Blue\" a Bob Dylan cover."@en ;

It was released on 30 July 2012, commemorating the 21st anniversary of the release of Leisure, the band's first album. The release took place before the band's performance at Hyde Park as part of the 2012 Summer Olympics closing ceremony. One version of the box-set consists of eighteen CDs, three DVDs, one vinyl 7\" record (of the early Seymour track \"Superman\") and a hardcover book acting as a complete biography of the band. The CDs contain all seven Blur albums, with the first five remastered, with each album receiving a new second disc of B-side material; as well as four 'rarities' discs containing mostly previously unreleased material. The DVDs contain Showtime, The Singles Night and an all-new rarities disc. It is the band's most retrospective release. Another boxset, Blur 21 Vinyl Edition, was released at the same time, featuring the band's seven studio albums on heavyweight vinyl, each of the LPs repackaged as a double album except for Leisure, a single album. The vinyl edition does not, however, include any previously unreleased material. As above, the Blur 21 CD/DVD/7\" single pack contains many previously unreleased recordings, including the long-awaited releases of previously known about songs like \"Pap Pop,\" \"Beached Whale\" and \"Sir Elton John's Cock.\" Yet some previously released songs by the band have not been listed as featuring on the box set, such as \"Colours,\" a Think Tank outtake released as a fan club single in 2003.

Additionally, no material from the band's 1998 live recording and remix album Bustin' + Dronin' appears on the box set.

Recording for the album began in 2008.[citation needed] The first single from the album, \"To Be Continued...\", was not initially intended to be included on the album, but due to a positive response after its leak by the DJ Premier on Sirius' HipHopNation, the song was included. There is no track 13. Evidence speaks on it, \"There is no track 13 on purpose. The first line of To Be Continued starts '10 commandments, 24 hours, the 13th floor was missing from the towers'. The Masons, any buildings built by them leave the 13th floor out. 13 is not just a lucky number, but an unlucky number too. People use it both ways. For me to leave it [the 13th track] blank and then explain why in the first line of the next track [To Be Continued] to me is genius.

The program was performed on May 7, 2011, at the Arlene Schnitzer Concert Hall in Portland, Oregon, and again the following day. Both concerts were recorded for album release. On May 12, the Oregon Symphony repeated the program at the inaugural Spring for Music Festival, at Carnegie Hall. The performance was broadcast live by KQAC and WQXR-FM, the classical radio stations serving Portland and the New York City metropolitan area, respectively. The concerts marked the Oregon Symphony's first performances of The Wound-Dresser as well as guest baritone Sanford Sylvan's debut with the company. In October 2011 the recording of the Portland performances was released on CD by Dutch record label PentaTone Classics. The album marked the orchestra's first release in eight years and Kalmar's first with the Oregon Symphony. The live performances and album received favorable reviews; the recording debuted at number 31 on Billboard's Classical Albums chart, and made several lists of the best classical recordings of 2011. The album earned three recognitions from the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences for the 2013 Grammy Awards. Kalmar and the Oregon Symphony were nominated in the categories Best Orchestral Performance and Best Engineered Album, Classical (along with engineers Jesse Lewis and John Newton, and mastering engineer Jesse Brayman).

The album was released through Cooking Vinyl on 9 September 2011 to mostly positive reviews. It was produced by Mark Stoermer and recorded at Battle Born Studios, in Las Vegas from September to October 2010. Howling Bells began writing for The Loudest Engine more than two years preceding its release while they supported Coldplay on the Viva la Vida Tour. The band sought to capture more closely the essence of its debut album, Howling Bells, and retract from its technically inclined predecessor, Radio Wars. Vocalist and rhythm guitarist Juanita Stein was credited for writing most of the lyrical content on The Loudest Engine. The band moved on from all five record labels it was signed to and established an exclusive partnership with Cooking Vinyl. Only one single, \"Into the Sky\" was released from the album and it was the first Howling Bells album issued as an LP record. The Australian release and the LP release contain an extra track named \"Arrows\", which is a demo that was recorded in Sydney. Preceding the release of the album, Howling Bells released a non-physical EP issued via PledgeMusic, titled Invisible. The Loudest Engine appeared on both the UK Albums Chart and the Australian Albums Chart. Howling Bells characterized The Loudest Engine as a contemporary psychedelic endeavor which was reinforced by the atmosphere of their time spent in the Mojave Desert. To support the album Howling Bells performed a number of headline shows and opened for both Elbow and The Killers. Following this period of time, bass player Brendan Picchio left the band and was subsequently replaced by Gary Daines."@en ;

Cooper liked the idea, and decided to recruit previous members of the Alice Cooper band. The concept of the album was described by Cooper as \"another nightmare, and this one is even worse than the last one.\" Cooper said that he had originally intended to make a sequel to his previous album, Along Came a Spider, but decided to make the Nightmare sequel after Ezrin explained that he \"wasn't really into it.\" The album was completed sometime during early 2011, with Cooper announcing its completion in February 2011 on his radio show, Nights with Alice Cooper. It was first scheduled to be released late in 2011 on Bob Ezrin's Bigger Picture label as part of a deal involving marketing, touring and production work by Bigger Picture for Cooper in the future.

All four albums were first released in Japan beginning in October 1994 up through November 1995. Macross Plus Soundtrack and Macross Plus Soundtrack II have also been released in the United States by AnimeTrax. Macross Plus features the work of renowned Japanese musician and composer Yoko Kanno. While Please Save My Earth was the first anime series that she composed for, her work on Macross Plus has tended to overshadow the former. Kanno's Macross Plus compositions have been described as seeming \"to be written in a far future or a distant galaxy,\" yet still retain their listener appeal. Kanno has stated that several of the songs such as \"SANTI-U\" and \"Pulse\" do not feature actual languages, but rather sound like them. She has also described Macross Plus executive director Shoji Kawamori as not being very detailed when it came to musical instruction."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Lord Sutch and Heavy Friends is the debut album of English rock singer Screaming Lord Sutch. Recording began in May 1969 at Mystic Studios in Hollywood and it was released on Cotillion Records in 1970. The album featured an all-star line-up with contributions from Led Zeppelin's Jimmy Page (who also produced the album) and John Bonham, guitarist Jeff Beck, session keyboardist Nicky Hopkins, session guitarist Deniel Edwards and Jimi Hendrix Experience bass-player Noel Redding. Rick Brown and Carlo Little were previously with The Savages. Many of the musicians who played for Sutch on this album had grave misgivings upon its release. They were under the assumption these were demo quality recordings. As a result the artists disowned the project and the album sold poorly. It also seriously damaged Sutch's reputation with the musicians involved. \"I just went down to have a laugh, playing some old rock 'n' roll, a bit of a send-up. The whole joke sort of reversed itself and became ugly,\" Jimmy Page said of the record. A reviewer in Rolling Stone called Sutch \"absolutely terrible\" and lamented that the celebrated musicians involved were made to sound \"like a fouled parody of themselves\". Lord Sutch and Heavy Friends was named in a 1998 BBC poll as the worst album of all time, a status it also held in Colin Larkin's book The Top 1000 Albums of All Time. This album has also been released under the name Smoke and Fire. A CD release under the latter name appeared on the Magnum Music Group label sometime in the 1980s, evidently mastered from a vinyl copy of the original album. The cover credits Page, Beck, Bonham, Redding and Hopkins; Sutch's name appears only in the personnel list, as David Sutch."@en ;

The band was often criticized for this effort because it is an extreme departure from their normal musical style.[citation needed]"@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"The Eurovision Song Contest 2015 was the 60th anniversary edition of the annual Eurovision Song Contest musical event. The contest took place in Vienna, Austria, following Austrian Conchita Wurst's victory in the 2014 edition. This was the second time that Austria hosted the contest; the 1967 edition being the first (also hosted in Vienna). The 2015 contest consisted of two semi-finals, which took place on 19 and 21 May, and a final, held on 23 May 2015. The shows were presented by Mirjam Weichselbraun, Alice Tumler and Arabella Kiesbauer while Conchita Wurst was hosting the green room. Forty countries participated in the contest, with Australia making a guest appearance, and Cyprus, the Czech Republic, and Serbia returning. Ukraine, however, announced their withdrawal due to financial and political reasons around the Ukrainian crisis. After a tense voting process, based on 50% jury and 50% televoting, Sweden won the contest for the sixth time, with M\u00E5ns Zelmerl\u00F6w's song \"Heroes\". Sweden became the first country to win the contest twice in the current format, and this was the country's second win in four years and the 21st century. Italy won the viewers voting with Russia in second place, and Sweden in third place. Sweden won the jury voting, with Latvia in second place and Russia in third place. This is the first time since the juries were reintroduced alongside the televoting in 2009 that the winner didn't place first in the televoting. For the first time, the top four of the contest all scored 200 points or better. Russia's entry \"A Million Voices\" became the first non-winning Eurovision song to score over 300 points. Austria and Germany became the first countries since 2003 to score no points in the final. Austria is also the first host country to score nul points. The 2015 contest also saw the best ever result for Montenegro since its independence, and the Czech Republic. Also the top two countries of this contest were the same as the top two countries in the 2012 contest, being Sweden and Russia. A record-breaking 197 million viewers worldwide watched the contest, beating the 2014 viewing figures by 2 million."@en ;

According to the Austin Chronicle reviewer, \"this debut collaboration is a testament to just how deeply these two songwriters sympathize with each other's work, revealing a shared penchant for evocatively detailed images that blossom into visceral narratives.\" The Pitchfork Media reviewer was less sanguine: \"The 14 tracks on Molina and Johnson comprise an especially slow drive through somber countryside, windows up and speed limit carefully maintained.\". The cover art for the album was taken from a photograph by Jack Delano for the Office of War Information: Indiana Harbor Belt RR, switchman demonstrating signal with a \"fusee\" - used at twilight and dawn - when visibility is poor.

Released in 2009 on the band's label Hands on Music, the album was produced by Stu Hanna of the English folk duo Megson, with additional production by Mark Tucker. The album followed a painfully emotion period for Steve Knightley where members of his family battled serious illnesses. This led to the album becoming particularly personal and darker than previous Show of Hands albums, aided by Hanna's direct and sharp production. The album also discusses several social and political concerns, and contains several collaborations with other musicians and vocalists. The album was released to a positive critical reception, many praising the darker tone to the album, Knightley's lyrics and Hanna's production. Some fans, however, were alienated by the album. The album entered the UK Album Chart at number 170, becoming their first album to chart. The album featured in numerous year-end best albums lists, and at the BBC Radio 2 Folk Awards 2010, the band won the award for \"Best Duo\" whilst the album's title song won \"Best Original Song\"."@en ;

That title also was produced on both CD and DVD, but separately rather than together in the same package. The name Crimson White & Indigo is taken from the lyrics of the song \"Standing on the Moon\", which the Dead first performed earlier in 1989.

	dbo:abstract	"Footprint is the second solo album by American musician Gary Wright, released in 1971 on A&M Records. It contains \"Stand for Our Rights\", an anthem-like song calling for social unity that was issued as a single in advance of the album. Wright recorded the majority of Footprint in London with a large cast of musicians \u2013 including George Harrison, Hugh McCracken, Alan White, Klaus Voormann, Jim Gordon, Jim Keltner and Bobby Keys \u2013 many of whom, like Wright, had played on Harrison's All Things Must Pass triple album in 1970. Harrison's contributions included an uncredited role as producer, and serve as an example of his support for Wright during the early stages of the latter's solo career. The ballad \"Love to Survive\" is one of three tracks that feature an orchestral arrangement by John Barham. To promote Footprint in America, Wright performed the song \"Two Faced Man\" on The Dick Cavett Show, backed by his short-lived band Wonderwheel, with Harrison as guest guitarist. Although it received favorable reviews from some music critics, the album failed to chart in the US or Britain. After recording and touring with Wonderwheel through 1972, Wright rejoined his former band Spooky Tooth, before returning as a solo artist with his breakthrough album, The Dream Weaver (1975). Footprint was issued on CD in 2005, coupled on a two-disc set with Wright's debut, Extraction (1970). \"Stand for Our Rights\" and \"Two Faced Man\" also appeared on the 1998 compilation Best of Gary Wright: The Dream Weaver. The song \"Give Me the Good Earth\" was covered by Manfred Mann's Earth Band and provided the title for their 1974 album The Good Earth."@en ;

The CD captures some of the discs that Nick spun when he was deejaying for \u00A310 a night at the club and Duran Duran were the resident band. The inspiration for it came when in 2000 John and Nick spent hours selecting 50 tracks for a 4-hour radio broadcast entitled \"A Night At The Rum Runner\". The 18 track CD was released on 8 May 2006 and presented in a silver gatefold card sleeve in shocking pink metallic print featuring photographs taken from this period, first published in the book \"Duran Duran Unseen\" by Paul Edmond, the front cover photo being of fashion designer Patti Bell."@en ;

While Herbert Gr\u00F6nemeyer's \"Zeit, dass sich was dreht\" was the official World Cup theme song, the single \"'54, '74, '90, 2006\" became a fan hymn for the German World Cup squad and was a number one hit in Germany. The song commemorates German championships in the 1954, 1974, and 1990 World Cups. After Germany lost in the semi-final against Italy on July 4, 2006, the song was reworked as \"'54, '74, '90, 2010\" in anticipation of the 2010 FIFA World Cup in South Africa.

To make up for the delay, Slaine released his mixtape The Devil Never Dies at the same time the album had been expected to hit shelves. The original version of the album leaked after Nokia Digital accidentally released a digital version for sale on the planned October 26 release date. Therefore, the album was set to be released in February 2011 but was later pushed back again to an unknown date. Slaine later confirmed that the album will be released on August 16, 2011 and will be known as \"A World with No Skies 2.0\". Slaine has stated that roughly half of the tracks on the CD are the same as the original track list.

Though it's an album of covers, Heathen Earth is not actually a cover but an interpretation in the vein of Throbbing Gristle as there's no actual song by the band with that song title but rather Heathen Earth being the name of one of their albums. Osborne stated in an interview with Spin Magazine \"This is Throbbing Gristle's Heathen Earth in the style of what Throbbing Gristle would do.\". Three of the tracks had been previously released in splits. Black Betty previously appeared on a split 7\" with the Jon Spencer Blues Explosion covering the same track. Female Trouble and Carpe Diem are featured on a split 12\" with Redd Kross. A nine-part 7\" singles series entitled \"Nine Clowns of the Apocalypse\" has been announced for ten of the tracks from Amphetamine Reptile Records in the midst of the split series being released for Sugar Daddy Live. Ten of the songs will be released with seven of the 7\" releases featuring bonus cover songs of each respective band. The first two volumes were released in July (Venom and The Scientists). Two more volumes (The Kinks and Pop-O-Pies/Tales of Terror have been confirmed) were released in November. The tribute to Roxy Music was released in December and the last one of the series in 2013. The tributes to Queen and David Bowie are slated for April of 2014. The final two volumes (The Jam and Throbbing Gristle) will be released in March of 2015.

It was recorded in Mexico City, New York, and Los Angeles and was produced by Lee Levin and Dan Warner under their production name Los Gringo, with additional works from Matt Rollings and Brian Lang. Markedly different in style from his previous albums, Poquita Ropa was produced using as few musical instruments as possible. Arjona's goal was to produce the songs \"almost as they were born\"; he achieved this by using nonexistent sounds to make the songs sound more acoustic. Arjona achieved a production style that made the songs sound like a capella performances, and he said that \"music and women look better with little clothes.\" The album was critically and commercially successful, became his third number one album on the Billboard Top Latin Albums and Latin Pop Albums chart, and also topped the charts in Argentina and Mexico. It was certified Platinum in Argentina and Mexico, and was certified Gold in Chile, Colombia and the United States. The album was nominated at the 53rd Grammy Awards for Best Latin Pop Album. Poquita Ropa was given generally positive reviews; Jason Birchmeier of Allmusic considered the album a \"stripped-down acoustic effort\" and said that it was \"impressive\". Poquita Ropa spawned three singles. \"Puente\", a song with Cuban influences, was released as the lead single from the album and peaked at number 36 on the Billboard Latin Pop Songs chart. The other two singles released were \"Vida\" and \"Marta\", both of which failed to appear on the charts. Instead of promoting the album with a worldwide tour, Arjona produced an eponymous film which was broadcast on HBO and A&E. It was directed by Joaqu\u00EDn Cambre, and features Mexican telenovela actress Edith Gonz\u00E1lez."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"2014 Forest Hills Drive is the third studio album by American hip hop recording artist J. Cole. It was released on December 9, 2014, by Dreamville, Roc Nation and Columbia Records. Recording sessions took place over the whole year, while the production on the album was primarily by Cole himself, along with several others such as Illmind, Vinylz, Phonix Beats and Willie B. It was announced three weeks before its release and had very little marketing, with no singles or promotion taking place prior to its release. The album was supported by five singles; \"Apparently\", \"G.O.M.D.\", \"Wet Dreamz\", \"No Role Modelz\" and \"Love Yourz\". Upon its release, 2014 Forest Hills Drive received generally positive reviews from critics who admired its ambitious concept, production and lyrics. The album debuted at number one on Billboard 200, selling 353,000 copies in its first week. The album has since been certified Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).

The album is centered on a waltz composed by Welsh-born actor Anthony Hopkins. The waltz, called \"And the Waltz Goes On\" was composed by Hopkins in 1964. A fan of the Dutch violinist, Hopkins's wife sent his waltz to Rieu for consideration. Inspired by New Zealand's stunning landscape and the \u2018life must go on\u2019 attitude of its people in the face of the recent natural disasters, Andr\u00E9 composed a dreamy waltz together with his first violinist Frank Steijns entitled \"Dreaming of New Zealand\". The album includes both an instrumental version and one with English and M\u0101ori lyrics.

The cover artwork for \"Antagonise\" was created by Stefan Heilemann, who previously worked on MaYaN's debut album, Quarterpast. Comments Mark Jansen: \"It is based on the lyrics for 'Antagonise'.\" \"Stefan doesn't need any directions; he reads the lyrics and comes up with a phenomenal piece of art. That's why we love working with this guy!\" \"When Snowden revealed the information about the mass electronic surveillance data mining program called Prism, what quite some people already thought became a proven fact. We all have been spied on for many years and all our data has been backed up and safely stored. It can be used any time it's needed. All of this in the name of 'war against terrorism,' which, in fact, basically is a cover-up and a way to bring fear to people in order to get them under control. This trick has already been used many times in the past. History just keeps repeating itself.\" \"The media were covering the story, but politicians around the world, and in Europe in particular, didn't know how to react and remained silent.

Or will we allow a small group of elites to take all our freedom away for their own benefits?\" \"The constitution, the basis of our democracy, is not being respected.\" \"Don't get yourself fooled, this is not in our interest.\" \"If you want to see the truth, you'll see the truth.\" \"We are what we eat!?

The month-long pushback was due to the label waiting for the reception to the album's first single \"If You Love Me\". The song originally appeared as a solo track by Stokley Williams on the soundtrack to the 1998 Jada Pinkett Smith film Woo. The song was re-recorded with the band and a featured a string section that was arranged and composed by legendary conductor Clare Fischer. The music video was directed by Bille Woodruff. \"If You Love Me\" peaked at number 30 on the Billboard Hot 100 and 5 on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Singles & Tracks. A second single was released- \"Is This Pain Our Pleasure\" and peaked at number 42 on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Singles & Tracks chart. The low charting of the song was due primarily to a music video never being made for the song. Upon release, Life's Aquarium charted at number 64 on the Billboard 200 and number 7 on the R&B albums charts. To date, it is the lowest selling Mint Condition album released on a major label. Life's Aquarium is notable for being their last album as a sextet. One year after its release, keyboardist Keri Lewis would leave the band- reducing the band to a quintet. It is also notable for being their last album released on a major label- as they would go independent for their subsequent releases."@en ;
