dbr:Beastie_Boys	rdf:type	dbo:Band ;
	dbo:abstract	"The Beastie Boys were an American hip hop/rock band from New York City, formed in 1981. For the majority of its career, the group consisted of Michael \"Mike D\" Diamond (vocals, drums), Adam \"MCA\" Yauch (vocals, bass) and Adam \"Ad-Rock\" Horovitz (vocals, guitar). Originally formed as a four-piece hardcore punk band, The Young Aborigines, in 1978 by Diamond (vocals), John Berry (guitar), Yauch (bass) and Kate Schellenbach (drums), the band appeared on the compilation cassette New York Thrash, before recording their first EP, Polly Wog Stew, in 1982. Berry left shortly thereafter, and was replaced by Horovitz. After achieving moderate local success with the 1983 experimental hip hop 12-inch \"Cooky Puss\", Schellenbach dropped out and the group made a full transition to hip hop, releasing a string of successful singles. The Beastie Boys toured with Madonna in 1985 and a year later released their debut album Licensed to Ill. The group sold 26 million albums in the United States and 50 million albums worldwide, making them, according to Billboard, \"the biggest-selling rap group\" since the magazine began recording sales data in 1991. With seven platinum or better albums from 1986\u20132004, the Beastie Boys were one of the longest-lived hip hop acts worldwide. In 2009, the group released digitally remastered deluxe editions of their albums Paul's Boutique, Check Your Head, Ill Communication and Hello Nasty. Their eighth studio album, Hot Sauce Committee Part Two, was released in 2011, and received positive reviews. They were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in April 2012, \"just the third rap group to enter the Hall, after Run\u2013D.M.C. (2009) and Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five (2007).\" The following month, MCA died of cancer of the parotid salivary gland. In June 2014, Mike D confirmed that he and Ad-Rock would not continue with the Beastie Boys, out of respect to Adam Yauch."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Black Sabbath are an English rock band, formed in Birmingham in 1968, by guitarist and main songwriter Tony Iommi, bassist and main lyricist Geezer Butler, singer Ozzy Osbourne, and drummer Bill Ward. The band have since experienced multiple line-up changes, with guitarist Iommi being the only constant presence in the band through the years. Originally formed in 1968 as a blues rock band, the group soon adopted the Black Sabbath moniker and began incorporating occult themes with horror-inspired lyrics and tuned-down guitars. Despite an association with these two themes, Black Sabbath also composed songs dealing with social instability, political corruption, the dangers of drug abuse and apocalyptic prophecies of the horrors of war. Osbourne's regular abuse of alcohol and other drugs led to his dismissal from the band in 1979. He was replaced by former Rainbow vocalist Ronnie James Dio. Following two albums with Dio, Black Sabbath endured countless personnel changes in the 1980s and 1990s that included vocalists Ian Gillan, Glenn Hughes, Ray Gillen and Tony Martin, as well as several drummers and bassists. In 1992, Iommi and Butler rejoined Dio and drummer Vinny Appice to record Dehumanizer. The original line-up reunited with Osbourne in 1997 and released a live album Reunion. Black Sabbath's 19th studio album, 13, which features all of the original members but Ward, was released in June 2013. Black Sabbath are often cited as pioneers of heavy metal music. The band helped define the genre with releases such as Black Sabbath (1970), Paranoid (1970) and Master of Reality (1971). They were ranked by MTV as the \"Greatest Metal Band\" of all time, and placed second in VH1's \"100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock\" list. Rolling Stone magazine ranked them number 85 in their \"100 Greatest Artists of All Time\". They have sold over 70 million records worldwide. Black Sabbath were inducted into the UK Music Hall of Fame in 2005 and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2006. They have also won two Grammy Awards for Best Metal Performance."@en ;

The founding members were New Zealander Neil Finn (vocalist, guitarist, primary songwriter) and Australians Paul Hester (drums) and Nick Seymour (bass). Later band members included Neil Finn's brother, Tim Finn, and Americans Mark Hart and Matt Sherrod. Originally active from 1985 to 1996, the band has had consistent commercial and critical success in Australia and New Zealand and international chart success in two phases, beginning with their self-titled debut album, which reached number twelve on the US Album Chart in 1987 and provided the Top Ten hits \"Don't Dream It's Over\" and \"Something So Strong\". Further international success came in the UK and Europe with their third and fourth albums, Woodface and Together Alone and the compilation album Recurring Dream, which included the hits \"Fall at Your Feet\", \"Weather with You\", \"Distant Sun\", \"Locked Out\", \"Instinct\" and \"Not the Girl You Think You Are\". Queen Elizabeth II bestowed an OBE on both Neil and Tim Finn, in June 1993, for their contribution to the music of New Zealand. Founding drummer Hester left in May 1994 citing family reasons, but briefly returned for their \"Farewell to the World\" concerts in Melbourne and Sydney in 1996. Neil Finn had decided to end the band to concentrate on his solo career and the Finn Brothers project with Tim. On 26 March 2005 Hester died by suicide, aged 46. In 2006 the group re-formed with new drummer Matt Sherrod and have since released two further albums, both of which reached number one on Australia's album chart."@en ;

The group's original line-up consisted of Dave Gahan (lead vocals, occasional songwriter since 2005), Martin Gore (keyboards, guitar, vocals, chief songwriter after 1981), Andy Fletcher (keyboards), and Vince Clarke (keyboards, chief songwriter from 1980 until 1981). Depeche Mode released their debut record in 1981, Speak & Spell, bringing the band onto the British new wave scene. Clarke left the band after the release of the album, leaving the band as a trio to record A Broken Frame, released the following year. Gore took over lead songwriting duties and, later in 1982, Alan Wilder (keyboards, drums, occasional songwriter) officially joined the band to fill Clarke's spot, establishing a line up that would continue for the next thirteen years. The band's last albums of the 1980s, Black Celebration and Music for the Masses, established them as a dominant force on the mainstream electronic music scene. A highlight of this era was the band's concert at the Pasadena Rose Bowl, where they drew a crowd in excess of 60,000 people. In the new decade, Depeche Mode released Violator, a mainstream success. The subsequent album, Songs of Faith and Devotion, and the supporting Devotional Tour exacerbated tensions within the band to the point where Alan Wilder quit in 1995, leading to intense media and fan speculation that the band would split. Now a trio once again, the band released Ultra in 1997, recorded at the height of Gahan's near-fatal drug abuse, Gore's alcoholism and seizures and Fletcher's depression. The release of Exciter confirmed Depeche Mode's willingness to remain together, the subsequent, and very successful, Exciter Tour being their first tour in support of an original album in eight years since the Devotional Tour, although the band had toured in 1998 to support The Singles 86\u201398 compilation album. Depeche Mode have had fifty songs in the UK Singles Chart and thirteen top 10 albums in the UK charts. Depeche Mode have sold over 100 million records worldwide. Q magazine calls Depeche Mode \"the most popular electronic band the world has ever known\" and included the band in the list of the \"50 Bands That Changed the World!\". Depeche Mode also rank number 98 on VH1's \"100 Greatest Artists Of All Time\"."@en ;

The band had a No. 14 Billboard chart hit in 1980 with the single \"Whip It\", and has maintained a cult following throughout its existence. Devo's music and stage show mingle kitsch science fiction themes, deadpan surrealist humor, and mordantly satirical social commentary. Their often discordant pop songs feature unusual synthetic instrumentation and time signatures that have proven influential on subsequent popular music, particularly new wave, industrial and alternative rock artists. Devo was also a pioneer of the music video, creating many memorable clips for the LaserDisc format, with \"Whip It\" getting heavy airplay in the early days of MTV."@en ;

The band have sold more than 100 million records worldwide, making them one of the best-selling bands of all time. In 1998, selected members of Fleetwood Mac were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, and received the Brit Award for Outstanding Contribution to Music. The two most successful periods for the band were during the late 1960s British blues boom, when they were led by guitarist Peter Green and achieved a UK number one with \"Albatross\"; and from 1975 to 1987, as a more pop-oriented act, featuring Christine McVie, Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks. Fleetwood Mac's second album after the incorporation of Buckingham and Nicks, 1977's Rumours, produced four U.S. Top 10 singles (including Nicks' song \"Dreams\"), and remained at No. 1 on the American albums chart for 31 weeks, as well as reaching the top spot in various countries around the world. To date, the album has sold over 40 million copies worldwide, making it the eighth-highest-selling album of all time. The band achieved more modest success between 1971 and 1974, when the line-up included Bob Welch, during the 1990s in between the departure and return of Nicks and Buckingham, and during the 2000s between the departure and return of Christine McVie. Due to numerous lineup changes, the only original member present in the band is drummer Mick Fleetwood. Although band founder Green named the group by combining the surnames of two of his former bandmates (Fleetwood and McVie) from John Mayall's Bluesbreakers, bassist John McVie played neither on their first single nor at their first concerts, as he initially decided to stay with Mayall. Keyboardist Christine McVie, who joined the band in 1970 while married to John McVie, has appeared on every album except the debut album, either as a member or as a session musician.

Ranging from quintet to septet, the band was known for its unique and eclectic style, which fused elements of country, folk, bluegrass, blues, reggae, rock, improvisational jazz, psychedelia, space rock, for live performances of lengthy instrumental jams, and for their devoted fan base, known as \"Deadheads\". \"Their music,\" writes Lenny Kaye, \"touches on ground that most other groups don't even know exists.\" These various influences were distilled into a diverse and psychedelic whole that made the Grateful Dead \"the pioneering Godfathers of the jam band world\". The band was ranked 57th in the issue The Greatest Artists of all Time by Rolling Stone magazine. The band was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1994 and their Barton Hall Concert at Cornell University (May 8, 1977) was added to the Library of Congress's National Recording Registry. The Grateful Dead have sold more than 35 million albums worldwide. The Grateful Dead was founded in the San Francisco Bay Area amid the rise of the counterculture of the 1960s. The founding members were Jerry Garcia (guitar, vocals), Bob Weir (guitar, vocals), Ron \"Pigpen\" McKernan (keyboards, harmonica, vocals), Phil Lesh (bass, vocals), and Bill Kreutzmann (drums). Members of the Grateful Dead had played together in various San Francisco bands, including Mother McCree's Uptown Jug Champions and the Warlocks. Lesh was the last member to join the Warlocks before they became the Grateful Dead; he replaced Dana Morgan Jr., who had played bass for a few gigs. Drummer Mickey Hart and nonperforming lyricist Robert Hunter joined in 1967. With the exception of McKernan, who died in 1973, and Hart, who took time off from 1971 to 1974, the core of the band stayed together for its entire 30-year history. The other official members of the band are Tom Constanten (keyboards 1968\u20131970), Keith Godchaux (keyboards 1971\u20131979), Donna Godchaux (vocals 1972\u20131979), Brent Mydland (keyboards, vocals 1979\u20131990), and Vince Welnick (keyboards, vocals 1990\u20131995). Pianist Bruce Hornsby was a touring member from 1990 to 1992, as well as guesting with the band on occasion before and after. The band and its fans (\"Deadheads\") are closely associated with the hippie movement and were seen as a form of institution in the culture of America for many years. Former members of the Grateful Dead, along with other musicians, toured as the Dead in 2003, 2004, and 2009 after touring as the Other Ones in 1998, 2000, and 2002. There are many contemporary incarnations of the Dead, with the most prominent touring acts being Furthur, Phil Lesh & Friends, RatDog, and the Rhythm Devils with drummers Mickey Hart and Bill Kreutzmann. The group performed together again for their fiftieth anniversary, with Trey Anastasio of Phish, in what the band announced would be their final concerts."@en ;

dbr:Joy_Division	rdf:type	dbo:Band ;
	dbo:abstract	"Joy Division were an English rock band formed in 1976 in Salford, Greater Manchester. Originally named Warsaw, the band consisted of singer Ian Curtis, guitarist and keyboardist Bernard Sumner, bassist Peter Hook, and drummer Stephen Morris. Formed by Sumner and Hook after the two attended a Sex Pistols gig, Joy Division moved beyond their punk roots to develop a sound and style that made them one of the pioneers of the post-punk movement. Their self-released 1978 debut EP, An Ideal for Living, drew the attention of the Manchester television personality Tony Wilson, who signed the group to his independent label, Factory Records. Joy Division's debut album, Unknown Pleasures, recorded with producer Martin Hannett, was released in 1979 to critical acclaim. As the band's popularity grew, Curtis, who suffered from personal problems that included severe depression, a failing marriage, and epilepsy, found it increasingly difficult to perform at live concerts, during which he occasionally collapsed into seizures. In May 1980, on the eve of the band's first American tour, Curtis, aged 23, committed suicide. The group's second and final album, Closer, was released two months later; the album and preceding single \"Love Will Tear Us Apart\" became the band's highest charting release. After Curtis's death, the remaining members continued as New Order and achieved critical and commercial success. Although their career spanned less than four years, Joy Division have continued to exert a vast influence on a variety of subsequent artists."@en ;

The band was fronted by both H\u00FCtter and Schneider until Schneider's departure in 2008. The signature Kraftwerk sound combines driving, repetitive rhythms with catchy melodies, mainly following a Western classical style of harmony, with a minimalistic and strictly electronic instrumentation. The group's simplified lyrics are at times sung through a vocoder or generated by computer-speech software. Kraftwerk was one of the first groups to popularize electronic music and are considered to be pioneers. In the 1970s and early 1980s, Kraftwerk's distinctive sound was revolutionary; the band has had a lasting effect across many genres of modern music. According to The Observer, \"no other band since the Beatles has given so much to pop culture\" and a wide range of artists have been influenced by their music and imagery. In January 2014, the Grammy Academy honored Kraftwerk with a Lifetime Achievement Award."@en ;

dbr:Led_Zeppelin	rdf:type	dbo:Band ;
	dbo:abstract	"Led Zeppelin were an English rock band formed in London in 1968. The group consisted of guitarist Jimmy Page, singer Robert Plant, bassist and keyboardist John Paul Jones, and drummer John Bonham. The band's heavy, guitar-driven sound, rooted in blues and psychedelia on their early albums, has earned them recognition as one of the progenitors of heavy metal, though their unique style drew from a wide variety of influences, including folk music. After changing their name from the New Yardbirds, Led Zeppelin signed a deal with Atlantic Records that afforded them considerable artistic freedom. Although the group was initially unpopular with critics, they achieved significant commercial success with albums such as Led Zeppelin (1969), Led Zeppelin II (1969), Led Zeppelin III (1970), Led Zeppelin IV (1971), Houses of the Holy (1973), and Physical Graffiti (1975). Their fourth album, which features the track \"Stairway to Heaven\", is among the most popular and influential works in rock music, and it helped to secure the group's popularity. Page wrote most of Led Zeppelin's music, particularly early in their career, while Plant generally supplied the lyrics. Jones' keyboard-based compositions later became central to the group's catalogue, which featured increasing experimentation. The latter half of their career saw a series of record-breaking tours that earned the group a reputation for excess and debauchery. Although they remained commercially and critically successful, their output and touring schedule were limited during the late 1970s, and the group disbanded following Bonham's death from alcohol-related asphyxia in 1980. In the decades that followed, the surviving members sporadically collaborated and participated in one-off Led Zeppelin reunions. The most successful of these was the 2007 Ahmet Ertegun Tribute Concert in London, with Jason Bonham taking his late father's place behind the drums. Led Zeppelin are widely considered one of the most successful, innovative, and influential rock groups in history. They are one of the best-selling music artists in the history of audio recording; various sources estimate the group's record sales at 200 to 300 million units worldwide. With RIAA-certified sales of 111.5 million units, they are the second-best-selling band in the United States. Each of their nine studio albums placed in the top 10 of the Billboard album chart and six reached the number-one spot. Rolling Stone magazine described them as \"the heaviest band of all time\", \"the biggest band of the Seventies\", and \"unquestionably one of the most enduring bands in rock history\". They were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1995; the museum's biography of the band states that they were \"as influential\" during the 1970s as the Beatles were during the 1960s."@en ;

Their lineup consists of Fred Durst (lead vocals), Sam Rivers (bass guitar, backing vocals), John Otto (drums, percussions), and Wes Borland (guitars, backing vocals). Their work is marked by Durst's abrasive, angry lyrics and Borland's sonic experimentation and elaborate visual appearance, which includes face and body paint, masks and uniforms, as well as the band's elaborate live shows. The band has been nominated for three Grammy Awards, have sold 40 million records worldwide and won several other awards. Formed in 1994, Limp Bizkit became popular playing in the Jacksonville, Florida underground music scene in the late 1990s, and signed with Flip Records, a subsidiary of Interscope, which released their debut album, Three Dollar Bill, Y'all$ (1997). The band achieved mainstream success with their second and third studio albums, Significant Other (1999) and Chocolate Starfish and the Hot Dog Flavored Water (2000), although this success was marred by a series of controversies surrounding their performances at Woodstock '99 and the 2001 Big Day Out festival. Borland left the group in 2001, but Durst, Rivers, Otto and Lethal continued to record and tour with guitarist Mike Smith. Following the release of their album, Results May Vary (2003), Borland rejoined the band and recorded The Unquestionable Truth (Part 1) (2005) with Durst, Rivers, Lethal and drummer Sammy Siegler before entering a hiatus. In 2009, the band reunited with Borland playing guitar and began touring, culminating with the recording of the album Gold Cobra (2011), after which they left Interscope and later signed with Cash Money Records, but DJ Lethal was asked to leave the band soon after. They are currently recording their seventh studio album, Stampede of the Disco Elephants."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Marilyn Manson is an American rock band from Fort Lauderdale, Florida. Formed in 1989 by frontman Marilyn Manson and Daisy Berkowitz, the group was originally named Marilyn Manson & the Spooky Kids with their theatrical performances gathering a local cult following in the early 1990s. The band's lineup has changed between many of their album releases; the current members of Marilyn Manson are the eponymous lead singer (the only remaining original member), bassist Twiggy Ramirez, guitarist Paul Wiley, keyboardist/percussionist Daniel Fox, and drummer Gil Sharone. Until 1996, the name of each member was originally created by combining the first name of an iconic female sex symbol and the last name of an iconic serial killer (e.g., Marilyn Monroe and Charles Manson). The members of the band dress in outlandish makeup and costumes, and have engaged in intentionally shocking behavior both onstage and off. In the past, their lyrics often received criticism for their anti-religious sentiment and references to sex, violence and drugs. Their performances have frequently been called offensive and obscene, and, on several occasions, protests and petitions have led to the group being banned from performing. As this controversy began to wane throughout the 2000s, so did the band's mainstream popularity. Despite this, Jon Wiederhorn of MTV.com, in June 2003, referred to Marilyn Manson as \"the only true artist today\". Marilyn Manson has garnered much success: in the US, three of the band's albums have been certified platinum while three more were certified gold, and the band has seen eight of its releases debut in the top ten, including two number-one albums. VH1 has ranked Marilyn Manson as the seventy-eighth best rock band on their 100 Great Artists of Hard Rock. Aggregate site AcclaimedMusic.net lists Marilyn Manson number 714 in their artist rank for greatest of all time. Marilyn Manson has sold over 50 million records."@en ;

The Kirkwood brothers met Bostrom while attending Brophy Prep High School in Phoenix. The three then moved to Tempe, Arizona (a Phoenix suburb and home to Arizona State University) where the Kirkwood brothers purchased two adjacent homes, one of which had a shed in the back where they regularly practiced. Meat Puppets started as a punk rock band, but like most of their labelmates on SST Records, they established their own unique style, blending punk with country and psychedelic rock, and featuring Curt's warbling vocals. Meat Puppets later gained significant exposure when the Kirkwood brothers served as guest musicians on Nirvana's MTV Unplugged performance in 1993. The band's 1994 album Too High to Die subsequently became their most successful release. The band broke up twice, in 1996 and 2002, but reunited again in 2006.

dbr:Megadeth	rdf:type	dbo:Band ;
	dbo:abstract	"Megadeth is an American thrash metal band from Los Angeles, California. The group was formed in 1983 by guitarist Dave Mustaine and bassist David Ellefson, shortly after Mustaine's dismissal from Metallica. A pioneer of the American thrash metal scene, the band is credited as one of the genre's \"big four\" with Anthrax, Metallica and Slayer, responsible for thrash metal's development and popularization. Megadeth plays in a technical style, featuring fast rhythm sections and complex arrangements; themes of death, war, politics and religion are prominent in the group's lyrics. In 1985, the band released its debut album, Killing Is My Business... and Business Is Good!, on the independent label Combat Records. The album's moderate commercial success caught the attention of bigger labels, which led to Megadeth signing with Capitol Records. Their first major-label album, Peace Sells... but Who's Buying?, was released in 1986 and influenced the underground metal scene. Despite its prominence in thrash metal, frequent disputes between its members and substance abuse issues brought Megadeth negative publicity during this period. After the lineup stabilized, the band released a number of platinum-selling albums, including Rust in Peace (1990) and Countdown to Extinction (1992). These albums, along with touring worldwide, helped bring public recognition to Megadeth. The band temporarily disbanded in 2002 when Mustaine suffered an arm injury and re-established in 2004 without bassist Ellefson, who had taken legal action against Mustaine. Ellefson settled with Mustaine out of court and rejoined the group in 2010. Megadeth has hosted its own music festival, Gigantour, several times since mid-2005. As of 2014, Megadeth has sold 50 million records worldwide, earned platinum certification in the United States for five of its fifteen studio albums, and received eleven Grammy nominations. The band's mascot, Vic Rattlehead, regularly appears on album artwork and, since 2010, in live shows. The group has experienced controversy over its musical approach and lyrics, including canceled concerts and album bans. MTV has refused to play two of the band's videos that the network considered to condone suicide."@en ;

Their founding mainstay was Colin Hay on lead vocals; he formed the group with Jerry Speiser on drums and Ron Strykert on lead guitar. They were joined by Greg Ham on flute and keyboards and then John Rees on bass guitar. This line-up achieved national and international success in the early 1980s. In January 1983, they were the first Australian artists to have a simultaneous No. 1 album and No. 1 single in the United States Billboard charts \u2013 Business as Usual (released on 9 November 1981) and \"Down Under\" (1981), respectively. With the same works, they achieved the same distinction of a simultaneous No. 1 album and No. 1 single on the Australian, New Zealand and United Kingdom charts. Their second album, Cargo (2 May 1983) was also No. 1 in Australia, No. 2 in New Zealand, No. 3 in the US, and No. 8 in the UK. Their third album, Two Hearts (3 April 1985), reached the top 20 in Australia and top 50 in the US. At the Grammy Awards of 1983 they won the Best New Artist category; while at the ARIA Music Awards of 1994 they were inducted into the related Hall of Fame. Men at Work have sold over 30 million albums worldwide. According to Australian musicologist, Ian McFarlane, \"[i]rrespective of the band's fairytale rise to prominence, [their] phenomenal success inextricably created worldwide interest in Australia and Australian music ... [they] simply opened the floodgates with little more than a clutch of great songs\" The group disbanded in 1986 and reformed in 1996 to disband again by 2002. In May 2001 \"Down Under\" was listed at No. 4 on the APRA Top 30 Australian songs and Business as Usual appeared in the book, 100 Best Australian Albums (October 2010). In February 2010 Larrikin Music Publishing won a case against Hay and Strykert, their record label (Sony BMG Music Entertainment) and music publishing company (EMI Songs Australia) arising from the uncredited appropriation of \"Kookaburra\" for the flute line in \"Down Under\".

	dbo:abstract	"Metallica is an American heavy metal band formed in Los Angeles, California. Metallica was formed in 1981 when vocalist/guitarist James Hetfield responded to an advertisement posted by drummer Lars Ulrich in a local newspaper. The band's current line-up comprises founding members Hetfield and Ulrich, longtime lead guitarist Kirk Hammett and bassist Robert Trujillo. Lead guitarist Dave Mustaine and bassists Ron McGovney, Cliff Burton and Jason Newsted are former members of the band. Metallica collaborated over a long period with producer Bob Rock, who produced all of the band's albums from 1990 to 2003 and served as a temporary bassist between the departure of Newsted and the hiring of Trujillo. The band's fast tempos, instrumentals, and aggressive musicianship placed them as one of the founding \"big four\" bands of thrash metal, alongside Anthrax, Megadeth, and Slayer. The band earned a growing fan base in the underground music community and won critical acclaim with its first four albums; their third album Master of Puppets (1986) was described as one of the most influential and heaviest of thrash metal albums. Metallica achieved substantial commercial success with its eponymous fifth album Metallica (1991), which debuted at number one on the Billboard 200. With this release the band expanded its musical direction, resulting in an album that appealed to a more mainstream audience. In 2000, Metallica was among a number of artists who filed a lawsuit against Napster for sharing the band's copyright-protected material for free without consent from any band member. A settlement was reached and Napster became a pay-to-use service. Despite reaching number one on the Billboard 200, the release of St. Anger (2003) alienated many fans with the exclusion of guitar solos and the \"steel-sounding\" snare drum. A film titled Some Kind of Monster documented the recording of St. Anger and the tensions within the band during that time. In 2009, Metallica was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Metallica has released nine studio albums, four live albums, five extended plays, 26 music videos, and 37 singles. The band has won eight Grammy Awards and five of its albums have consecutively debuted at number one on the Billboard 200. The band's eponymous 1991 album has sold over 16 million copies in the United States, making it the best-selling album of the SoundScan era. Metallica ranks as one of the most commercially successful bands of all time, having sold over 110 million records worldwide. Metallica has been listed as one of the greatest artists of all time by many magazines, including Rolling Stone, which ranked them 61st on its list of The 100 Greatest Artists of All Time. As of December 2012, Metallica is the third best-selling music artist since Nielsen SoundScan began tracking sales in 1991, selling a total of 54.26 million albums in the U.S. In 2012, Metallica formed the independent record label Blackened Recordings and took full ownership of its albums and videos. As of 2016, the band is in production of its tenth studio album, which is expected to be released later in the year."@en ;

Minor Threat's song \"Straight Edge\" became the eventual basis of the straight edge movement, while the band often professed their own \"straight edge\" ideals. AllMusic described Minor Threat's music as \"iconic\" and noted that their groundbreaking music \"has held up better than [that of] most of their contemporaries.\" Along with the fellow Washington, D.C. hardcore band Bad Brains and California band Black Flag, Minor Threat set the standard for many hardcore punk bands in the 1980s and 1990s. All of Minor Threat's recordings were released on Ian MacKaye and Jeff Nelson's own label, Dischord Records. The Minor Threat EP and their only full-length studio album Out of Step have received a number of accolades and are cited as landmarks of the hardcore punk genre."@en ;

dbr:Motörhead	rdf:type	dbo:Band ;
	dbo:abstract	"Mot\u00F6rhead (/\u02C8mo\u028At\u0259rh\u025Bd/) were an English rock band formed in June 1975 by bassist, singer, and songwriter Ian Fraser \"Lemmy\" Kilmister, who was the sole constant member, guitarist and songwriter Larry Wallis.and drummer Lucas Fox. The band is often considered a precursor to, or one of the earliest members of, the New Wave of British Heavy Metal, which re-energised heavy metal in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Mot\u00F6rhead released 23 studio albums, 10 live recordings, 12 compilation albums, and five EPs over a career spanning 40 years. Usually a power trio, they had particular success in the early 1980s with several successful singles in the UK Top 40 chart. The albums Overkill, Bomber, Ace of Spades, and particularly No Sleep 'til Hammersmith cemented Mot\u00F6rhead's reputation as a top-tier rock band. The band are ranked number 26 on VH1's 100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock. As of 2012, they have sold more than 30 million albums worldwide. Mot\u00F6rhead are typically classified as heavy metal, and their fusion of punk rock into the genre helped to pioneer speed metal and thrash metal. Their lyrics typically covered such topics as war, good versus evil, abuse of power, promiscuous sex, substance abuse, and, most famously, gambling. Although Lemmy has been credited with being part of various musical scenes, thrash metal or speed metal in the main, from the mid 70s onward, he has stated very clearly over the years, when asked the question, that he plays Rock n Roll, and has more of an affiliation with Punk Rockers than with the so-called Heavy Metal scene, Mot\u00F6rhead having evolved out of the London 70s Punk era. Lemmy died on 28 December 2015 after being initially diagnosed with an undisclosed aggressive form of cancer, which was later revealed as prostate cancer and heart failure, after which drummer Mikkey Dee and guitarist Phil Campbell both confirmed that Mot\u00F6rhead would not continue as a band."@en ;

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/N.W.A>	rdf:type	dbo:Band ;
	dbo:abstract	"N.W.A (an abbreviation of Niggaz Wit Attitudes) was an American hip hop group from Compton, California. It was one of the earliest and most significant popularizers of the gangsta rap and West Coast hip hop subgenres, and is widely considered one of the seminal groups in the history of hip hop music. Active from 1986 to 1991, the rap group endured controversy owing to their music's explicit lyrics that many viewed as being disrespectful of women, as well as its glorification of drugs and crime. The group was subsequently banned from many mainstream American radio stations. In spite of this, the group has sold over 10 million units in the United States alone. The group was also known for their deep hatred of the police system, which sparked much controversy over the years. The original lineup consisted of Arabian Prince, Dr. Dre, Eazy-E, and Ice Cube. DJ Yella and MC Ren joined later, with Arabian Prince eventually leaving shortly before the official release of Straight Outta Compton over royalty disputes, with Ice Cube following suit in December 1989. Eazy-E, Dr. Dre, Ice Cube and MC Ren would later become platinum-selling solo artists in the 1990s. Their debut album Straight Outta Compton marked the beginning of the new gangsta rap era as the production and social commentary in their lyrics were revolutionary within the genre, while their second album Niggaz4Life would be the first hardcore rap album to debut at number one on the Billboard 200 sales charts. Rolling Stone ranked N.W.A number 83 on their list of the \"100 Greatest Artists of All Time\". In October 2012, N.W.A were nominated for induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame for the first time. In October 2013 the group was nominated for a second time. In December 2015, the group was announced as one of the inductees of the 2016 class of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, on their third try."@en ;

dbr:New_Order	rdf:type	dbo:Band ;
	dbo:abstract	"New Order are an English rock band formed in 1980, currently consisting of founding members Bernard Sumner, Stephen Morris and Gillian Gilbert, alongside Phil Cunningham and Tom Chapman. The band was formed in 1980 by Sumner (vocals, guitars, keyboards and synthesisers), ex member Peter Hook (bass and vocals) and Morris (drums, electronic drums, keyboards and synthesizers) \u2013 the remaining members of post-punk group Joy Division, following the suicide of vocalist Ian Curtis \u2013 with the addition of Gilbert (keyboards, synthesizers and guitars). By combining post-punk with an increasing influence from electronic dance music, New Order became one of the most critically acclaimed and influential bands of the 1980s. Though the band's early years were shadowed by the legacy and basic sound of Joy Division, their experience of the early 1980s New York City club scene increased their knowledge of dance music and helped them incorporate elements of that style into their work. The band's 1983 hit \"Blue Monday\", the best-selling 12-inch single of all time, is one example of how the band's sound became increasingly upbeat and electronic. New Order were the flagship band for Manchester-based independent record label Factory Records. Their unlabelled album sleeves and \"non-image\" (the band rarely gave interviews and were known for performing short concert sets with no encores) reflected the label's aesthetic of doing whatever the relevant parties wanted to do, including an aversion to including singles as album tracks. Because of the band's dance-rock genre it has a complex discography, with many well-known songs not featured on studio albums or released in a variety of mixes. Throughout their career, the band's records were carefully art-directed by Mancunian designer Peter Saville. The group disbanded in 1993 to work on individual projects, and reunited in 1998. In 2001, Cunningham (guitars, keyboards and synthesisers) replaced Gilbert, who took a sabbatical from the band because of family commitments. In 2007, Peter Hook left the band. After Hook's departure, Bernard, Phil and Stephen worked on Bad Lieutenant and the band reunited in 2011 without Hook, with Gilbert's return and Chapman replacing Hook on bass. During the band's career and in between lengthy breaks, band members have been involved in several solo projects, such as Sumner's Electronic and Bad Lieutenant; Hook's Monaco and Revenge and Gilbert and Morris' The Other Two. Cunningham was previously a member of Marion and with Sumner and Chapman was a member of Bad Lieutenant. In September 2015, the band released its tenth studio album, Music Complete."@en ;

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nirvana_(band)>	rdf:type	dbo:Band ;
	dbo:abstract	"Nirvana was an American rock band that was formed by singer and guitarist Kurt Cobain and bassist Krist Novoselic in Aberdeen, Washington, in 1987. Nirvana went through a succession of drummers, the longest-lasting being Dave Grohl, who joined the band in 1990. Despite releasing only three full-length studio albums in their seven-year career, Nirvana has come to be regarded as one of the most influential and important rock bands of the modern era. In the late 1980s Nirvana established itself as part of the Seattle grunge scene, releasing its first album Bleach for the independent record label Sub Pop in 1989. The band eventually came to develop a sound that relied on dynamic contrasts, often between quiet verses and loud, heavy choruses. After signing to major label DGC Records, Nirvana found unexpected success with \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\", the first single from the band's second album Nevermind (1991). Nirvana's sudden success widely popularized alternative rock as a whole, and the band's frontman Cobain found himself referred to in the media as the \"spokesman of a generation\", with Nirvana being considered the \"flagship band\" of Generation X. In response, Nirvana's third studio album, In Utero (1993), featured an abrasive, less-mainstream sound and challenged the group's audience. The album did not match the sales figures of Nevermind, but was still a commercial success and critically acclaimed. Nirvana's brief run ended following the death of Kurt Cobain in 1994, but various posthumous releases have been issued since, overseen by Novoselic, Grohl, and Cobain's widow Courtney Love. Since its debut, the band has sold over 25 million records in the United States alone, and over 75 million records worldwide, making them one of the best-selling bands of all time. Nirvana was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2014, in its first year of eligibility."@en ;

The group currently consists of founders Black Francis (lead vocals, rhythm guitar), Joey Santiago (lead guitar), and David Lovering (drums). Co-founder Kim Deal (bass, backing vocals) left in 2013 and was replaced by Kim Shattuck as live bass player for a few months, then by Paz Lenchantin for the band's 2014 tour. The Pixies achieved relatively modest popularity in their home country, but were significantly more successful in the United Kingdom, mainland Europe and Israel. The group is credited with having an influence on the alternative rock boom of the 1990s. The band's style of music contains a range of elements, including psychedelia, noise pop, hard rock, surf pop, and surf rock. Black Francis is the Pixies' primary songwriter and singer. His lyrics feature a number of offbeat subjects such as extraterrestrials, surrealism, incest, and biblical violence. Despite limited commercial success, their jarring pop sound subsequently influenced bands such as Nirvana, Radiohead, The Strokes, Blur and Weezer. The Pixies' legacy and popularity grew in the years following their break-up, leading to sold-out world tours following their reunion in 2004. In June 2013, the band released their first new material in almost 10 years."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Simon & Garfunkel was an American folk rock duo consisting of singer-songwriter Paul Simon and singer Art Garfunkel. They were one of the most popular recording artists of the 1960s and became counterculture icons of the decade's social revolution, alongside artists such as the Beatles, the Beach Boys, and Bob Dylan. Their biggest hits\u2014including \"The Sound of Silence\" (1964/1965), \"Mrs. Robinson\" (1968), \"Bridge over Troubled Water\" (1969), and \"The Boxer\" (1969)\u2014reached number one on singles charts worldwide. Their often rocky relationship led to artistic disagreements, which resulted in their breakup in 1970. Their final studio record, Bridge over Troubled Water, was their most successful, becoming one of the world's best-selling albums. Since their split in 1970 they have reunited several times, most famously in 1981 for the \"The Concert in Central Park\", which attracted more than 500,000 people, the seventh-largest concert attendance in history. The duo met as children in Queens, New York in 1953, where they learned to harmonize together and began writing original material. By 1957, under the name Tom & Jerry, the teenagers had their first minor success with \"Hey Schoolgirl\", a song imitating their idols the Everly Brothers. Afterwards, the duo went their separate ways, with Simon making unsuccessful solo records. In 1963, aware of a growing public interest in folk music, they regrouped and were signed to Columbia Records as Simon & Garfunkel. Their d\u00E9but, Wednesday Morning, 3 A.M., sold poorly, and they once again disbanded; Simon returned to a solo career, this time in England. A remix of their song \"The Sound of Silence\" was played widely on U.S. AM radio in 1965, reaching number one on the Billboard Hot 100. Simon & Garfunkel reunited, releasing their second studio album Sounds of Silence and touring colleges nationwide. On their third release, Parsley, Sage, Rosemary and Thyme (1966), the duo assumed more creative control. Their music was featured in the 1967 film The Graduate, giving them further exposure. Bookends (1968), their next album, topped the Billboard 200 chart and included the #1 single \"Mrs. Robinson\" from the film. After their 1970 breakup following the release of Bridge over Troubled Water, they both continued recording, Simon releasing a number of highly acclaimed albums, including 1986's Graceland. Garfunkel also briefly pursued an acting career, with leading roles in two Mike Nichols films, Catch-22 and Carnal Knowledge, and in Nicolas Roeg's 1980 Bad Timing. Simon & Garfunkel were described by critic Richie Unterberger as \"the most successful folk-rock duo of the 1960s\" and one of the most popular artists from the decade in general. They won 10 Grammy Awards and were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1990. Their Bridge over Troubled Water album was nominated at the 1977 Brit Awards for Best International Album and is ranked at #51 on Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time."@en ;

Founding members Thurston Moore (guitar, vocals), Kim Gordon (bass guitar, vocals, guitar) and Lee Ranaldo (guitar, vocals) remained together for the entire history of the band, while Steve Shelley (drums) followed a series of short-term drummers in 1985, and rounded out the core line-up. In their early career Sonic Youth were associated with the no wave art and music scene in New York City. Part of the first wave of American noise rock groups, the band carried out their interpretation of the hardcore punk ethos throughout the evolving American underground that focused more on the DIY ethic of the genre rather than its specific sound. The band experienced relative commercial success and critical acclaim throughout their existence, continuing partly into the new millennium, including signing to major label DGC in 1990 and headlining the 1995 Lollapalooza festival. Sonic Youth have been praised for having \"redefined what rock guitar could do\", using a wide variety of unorthodox guitar tunings and preparing guitars with objects like drum sticks and screwdrivers to alter the instruments' timbre. The band is considered to be a pivotal influence on the alternative and indie rock movements. In 2011 Ranaldo announced that the band was \"ending for a while\" following the separation of married couple Gordon and Moore. Thurston Moore updated and clarified the position in May 2014: \"Sonic Youth is on hiatus. The band is a democracy of sorts, and as long as Kim and I are working out our situation, the band can\u2019t really function reasonably.\" Gordon refers several times in her 2015 autobiography Girl in a Band to the band having \"split up\"."@en ;

Behind the revolving line-up and the regular sidemen, the true core of the Project was the duo of Parsons and Woolfson. Woolfson was a songwriter by profession, but also a composer and pianist. Almost all songs on the band's albums are credited to \"Parsons/Woolfson\"."@en ;

dbr:The_Beach_Boys	rdf:type	dbo:Band ;
	dbo:abstract	"The Beach Boys are an American rock band formed in Hawthorne, California in 1961. The group's original lineup consisted of brothers Brian, Dennis, and Carl Wilson, their cousin Mike Love, and their friend Al Jardine. They emerged at the vanguard of the \"California Sound\", performing original surf songs that gained international popularity for their distinct vocal harmonies and lyrics reflecting a southern California youth culture of surfing, cars, and romance. Influenced by jazz-based vocal groups, 1950s rock and roll, and doo-wop, Brian led the band in devising novel approaches to music production, arranging his compositions for studio orchestras, and experimenting with several genres ranging from pop ballads to psychedelic and baroque. The group began as a garage band managed by the Wilsons' father Murry, with Brian's creative ambitions and sophisticated songwriting abilities dominating the group's musical direction. After 1964, their albums took a different stylistic path that featured more personal lyrics, multi-layered sounds, and recording experiments. In 1966, the Pet Sounds album and \"Good Vibrations\" single vaunted the group to the top level of rock innovators and established the band as symbols of the nascent counterculture era. Following the dissolution of Smile, Brian gradually ceded control to the rest of the band, reducing his input because of mental health and substance abuse issues. Though the more democratic incarnation of the Beach Boys recorded a string of albums in various music styles that garnered international critical success, the group struggled to reclaim their commercial momentum in America. Since the 1980s, much-publicized legal wrangling over royalties, songwriting credits and use of the band's name transpired. Dennis drowned in 1983 and Carl died of lung cancer in 1998. After Carl's death, many live configurations of the band fronted by Mike Love and Bruce Johnston continued to tour into the 2000s while other members pursued solo projects. For the band's 50th anniversary, the surviving co-founders briefly reunited for a new studio album and world tour. The Beach Boys are regarded as the most iconic American band and one of the most critically acclaimed, commercially successful, and widely influential bands of all time, while AllMusic stated that their \"unerring ability... made them America's first, best rock band.\" The group had over eighty songs chart worldwide, thirty-six of them US Top 40 hits (the most by an American rock band), four reaching number-one on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. The Beach Boys have sold in excess of 100 million records worldwide, making them one of the world's best-selling bands of all time and are listed at number 12 on Rolling Stone magazine's 2004 list of the \"100 Greatest Artists of All Time\". They have received one Grammy Award for The Smile Sessions (2011). The core quintet of the three Wilsons, Love and Jardine were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1988."@en ;

They began performing together in 1962 in the Los Angeles area as part of a five-member group called The Paramours, but adopted the name The Righteous Brothers when they embarked on their recording career as a duo. They recorded from 1963 through 1975 and continued to perform until Hatfield's death in 2003. Their emotive vocal style is sometimes dubbed \"blue-eyed soul\". Hatfield and Medley have contrasting vocal range that helped them create a distinctive sound as a duet, but also strong vocal talent individually that allowed them to perform as soloists. Medley sang the low parts with his bass-baritone voice, with Hatfield taking the higher register vocals with his countertenor voice. They had their first hit with \"You've Lost That Lovin' Feelin'\", produced by Phil Spector and often considered one of his finest works. Other notable hits include \"Ebb Tide\", \"Soul and Inspiration\", \"Rock and Roll Heaven\", and in particular, \"Unchained Melody\". Both Hatfield and Medley also had for a time their own solo careers. In January 2016, the Righteous Brothers duo act was revived with Bill Medley and Bucky Heard."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Slipknot is an American heavy metal band from Des Moines, Iowa. The band was founded in September 1995 by percussionist Shawn Crahan and bassist Paul Gray. After several lineup changes in its early years, the band settled on nine members for more than a decade: Corey Taylor, Mick Thomson, Jim Root, Paul Gray, Craig Jones, Sid Wilson, Shawn Crahan, Chris Fehn and Joey Jordison. Gray died on May 24, 2010, and was replaced from 2011\u201314 by former guitarist Donnie Steele. Jordison left the band on December 12, 2013. Steele left during the recording sessions for .5: The Gray Chapter because he wanted to focus on his marriage. The band is now touring with replacement musicians Alessandro Venturella on bass and Jay Weinberg on drums. After the departure of Jordison, as of December 2015 the only founding member in the current lineup is percussionist Shawn Crahan; the other remaining members of Slipknot have been members since the release of the band's 1999 eponymous debut. Slipknot is well known for its attention-grabbing image, aggressive style of music, and energetic and chaotic live shows. The band rapidly rose to success following the release of their eponymous debut album in 1999. The 2001 follow-up album, Iowa, made the band more popular. After a brief hiatus, Slipknot returned in 2004 with Vol. 3: (The Subliminal Verses), before going on another hiatus and returning in 2008 with its fourth album, All Hope Is Gone, which debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 chart. After another long hiatus, Slipknot released its fifth studio album, .5: The Gray Chapter, in 2014. The band has released a live album titled 9.0: Live, a compilation album titled Antennas to Hell, and four live DVDs. In 2015, Slipknot headlined the Download Festival in the UK for the third time."@en ;

dbr:The_Byrds	rdf:type	dbo:Band ;
	dbo:abstract	"The Byrds /\u02C8b\u025C\u02D0rdz/ were an American rock band, formed in Los Angeles, California in 1964. The band underwent multiple line-up changes throughout its existence, with frontman Roger McGuinn (known as Jim McGuinn until mid-1967) remaining the sole consistent member, until the group disbanded in 1973. Although they only managed to attain the huge commercial success of contemporaries like the Beatles, the Beach Boys, and the Rolling Stones for a short period (1965\u201366), the Byrds are today considered by critics to be one of the most influential bands of the 1960s. Initially, they pioneered the musical genre of folk rock, melding the influence of the Beatles and other British Invasion bands with contemporary and traditional folk music. As the 1960s progressed, the band was also influential in originating psychedelic rock, raga rock, and country rock. The band's signature blend of clear harmony singing and McGuinn's jangly twelve-string Rickenbacker guitar has continued to be influential on popular music up to the present day. Among the band's most enduring songs are their cover versions of Bob Dylan's \"Mr. Tambourine Man\" and Pete Seeger's \"Turn! Turn! Turn! (to Everything There Is a Season)\", along with the self-penned originals, \"I'll Feel a Whole Lot Better\", \"Eight Miles High\", \"So You Want to Be a Rock 'n' Roll Star\", \"Ballad of Easy Rider\" and \"Chestnut Mare\". The original five-piece line-up of the Byrds consisted of Jim McGuinn (lead guitar, vocals), Gene Clark (tambourine, vocals), David Crosby (rhythm guitar, vocals), Chris Hillman (bass guitar, vocals), and Michael Clarke (drums). However, this version of the band was relatively short-lived and by early 1966, Clark had left due to problems associated with anxiety and his increasing isolation within the group. The Byrds continued as a quartet until late 1967, when Crosby and Clarke also departed the band. McGuinn and Hillman decided to recruit new members, including country rock pioneer Gram Parsons, but by late 1968, Hillman and Parsons had also exited the band. McGuinn, who by this time had changed his name to Roger after a flirtation with the Subud religion, elected to rebuild the band's membership and between 1968 and 1973, he helmed a new incarnation of the Byrds, featuring guitarist Clarence White among others. McGuinn disbanded the then current line-up in early 1973, to make way for a reunion of the original quintet. The Byrds' final album was released in March 1973, with the reunited group disbanding soon afterwards. Several former members of the band went on to successful careers of their own, either as solo artists or as members of such groups as Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young, the Flying Burrito Brothers and the Desert Rose Band. In the late 1980s, Gene Clark and Michael Clarke both began touring as the Byrds, prompting a legal challenge from McGuinn, Crosby, and Hillman over the rights to the band's name. As a result of this, McGuinn, Crosby, and Hillman performed a series of reunion concerts as the Byrds in 1989 and 1990, and also recorded four new Byrds' songs. In January 1991, the Byrds were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, an occasion that saw the five original members performing together for the last time. McGuinn, Crosby, and Hillman still remain active but Gene Clark died of a heart attack in May 1991, and Michael Clarke died of liver failure in December 1993."@en ;

dbr:Badfinger	rdf:type	dbo:Band ;
	dbo:abstract	"Badfinger were a British rock band that, in their most prolific lineup, consisted of Pete Ham, Mike Gibbins, Tom Evans and Joey Molland. The band evolved from an earlier group called The Iveys that was formed in 1961 by Ham, Ron Griffiths and David \"Dai\" Jenkins in Swansea, Wales. They were the first group signed by the Beatles' Apple label in 1968 as The Iveys. In 1969, Griffiths left and was replaced by Molland, and the band renamed themselves Badfinger. In 1970, the band engaged American businessman Stan Polley to manage their commercial affairs. Over the next five years the band recorded several albums for Apple and toured extensively, before they became embroiled in the chaos of Apple Records' dissolution. Badfinger had four consecutive worldwide hits from 1970 to 1972: \"Come and Get It\" (written and produced by Paul McCartney), \"No Matter What\", \"Day After Day\" (produced by George Harrison) and \"Baby Blue\". In 2013, \"Baby Blue\" made a resurgence onto the Billboard Hot Rock Songs chart at number 14 after it was featured in the series finale of the television show Breaking Bad. Their song \"Without You\" has been covered many times, including a Billboard number one hit for Harry Nilsson. They signed to Warner Bros., but Polley's financial machinations resulted in a lawsuit by Warner over missing escrow account money. Warner's consequent withdrawal from market of the 1974 album, Wish You Were Here (seven weeks after its release), cut off the band's income. Three days before his 28th birthday, on 24 April 1975, Ham committed suicide by hanging himself, leaving a note that included damning comments about Polley. Over the next three years, surviving members struggled to rebuild their personal and professional lives against a backdrop of lawsuits. The albums Airwaves (1979) and Say No More (1981) floundered, as Molland and Evans see-sawed between cooperation and struggle in attempts to revive and capitalise on the Badfinger legacy. Having seen Ham's body after Ham's wife had called him, Evans reportedly never got over his friend's suicide, and was quoted as saying in darker moments, \"I wanna be where he is.\" On 19 November 1983, Evans also took his own life by hanging."@en ;

The founding members were singer-songwriter and guitarist Dave Matthews, bassist Stefan Lessard, drummer/backing vocalist Carter Beauford and saxophonist LeRoi Moore. Boyd Tinsley was added to the band as a violinist soon after the band was formed. Moore died suddenly in August 2008 due to complications from injuries sustained in an ATV accident. Grammy Award-winner Jeff Coffin (of B\u00E9la Fleck and the Flecktones) has since filled Moore's spot as the band's saxophonist. Rashawn Ross and Tim Reynolds have also become full-time touring members of the band. The band's 2009 album Big Whiskey and the GrooGrux King (the first album since Moore's death) debuted at number one on the Billboard 200, earning the band their fifth consecutive number-one debut. Their most recent album, Away from the World, released in 2012, debuted at number one on the Billboard chart \u2014 making them the only group to have six consecutive studio albums debut in the top spot. As of 2010, the Dave Matthews Band has sold over 30 million records worldwide. The band is known for their annual summer-long tours of the United States and Europe, featuring lengthy improvisational renditions of their songs, accompanied by an elaborate video and lighting show. The band is known for playing the songs differently each time. This portion of the tour has become a stamp of DMB and has grown with the band since Fenton Williams began working with them in the early 1990s."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Question Mark and the Mysterians are an American garage rock band from Bay City and Saginaw in Michigan, who were initially active between 1962 and 1969. Much of the band's music consisted of electric organ-driven instrumentals, and an enigmatic image inspired by the science fiction film The Mysterians. In addition, the band's sound was also marked by raw-resonating lead vocals of \"?\" (Question Mark), making Question Mark and the Mysterians one of the earliest groups whose musical style is described as punk rock. Through their music, the group was recognized as a template for similar musical acts to follow. The band was signed to Pa-Go-Go Records in 1966, and released its first, and most acclaimed single, \"96 Tears\", in the early part of the year. \"96 Tears\" became a number one hit on the Billboard Hot 100, and propelled the group to a 15-month period of national prominence. Their debut album, 96 Tears followed. Though Question Mark and the Mysterians were unable to replicate their success with their later recordings, and are mistakenly deemed a \"one-hit wonder\", they did manage to reach the singles charts on five different occasions. In 1968, their label, Cameo-Parkway, was shut down for stock manipulation by the Securities Exchange Commission, taking the band's money and contract with them. After their disbandment in 1969, the band has regrouped and released additional material over the years."@en ;

During their career, the band released four LP records and seven 45s for the International Artists record label. They are often credited as one of the first psychedelic bands in the history of rock n' roll. According to the 2005 documentary You're Gonna Miss Me, Tommy Hall is credited with coining the term \"psychedelic rock\", although artists such as the Holy Modal Rounders and the Deep had used the term \"psychedelic\" to describe their music earlier. Their contemporary influence has been acknowledged by 1960s musicians such as Billy Gibbons of ZZ Top, Peter Albin of Big Brother and the Holding Company, and Chris Gerniottis of Zakary Thaks. Their debut 45 \"You're Gonna Miss Me\", a national Billboard No. 55 hit in 1966, was featured on the 1972 compilation Nuggets: Original Artyfacts from the First Psychedelic Era, 1965-1968, which is considered vital in the history of garage rock and the development of punk rock. Seminal punk band Television played their song \"Fire Engine\" live in the mid-1970s. In the 1980s\u20131990s, the 13th Floor Elevators influenced important bands such as Primal Scream, the Shamen and Spacemen 3, all of whom covered their songs, and 14 Iced Bears who use an electric jug on their single \"Beautiful Child\".

After its UK success, their first single, \"Being Boiled\", was reissued and became a top ten hit at the beginning of 1982. They received the Brit Award for Best British Breakthrough act in 1982. The success of \"Don't You Want Me\" is seen as the beginning of the MTV-driven Second British Invasion of the US. Other international hits include: \"Love Action\", \"Open Your Heart\", \"Mirror Man\", \"Fascination\", \"The Lebanon\", \"Human\" (a US No. 1) and \"Tell Me When\". The only constant band member since 1977 is vocalist and songwriter Philip Oakey. Originally an avant-garde all-male synthesizer-based group, The Human League evolved into a commercially successful synthpop band under Oakey's leadership. Since 1987, the band has essentially been a trio of Oakey and long-serving female vocalists Joanne Catherall and Susan Ann Sulley (both of whom joined the ensemble in 1980), with various sidemen.

The band originally consisted of Brad Arnold (vocals/drums), Todd Harrell (bass guitar) and Matt Roberts (guitar).They were soon joined by guitarist Chris Henderson, and later by drummer Richard Liles, who played for the band during their tour supporting their first album. Daniel Adair played drums on tour from 2002\u20132005. This configuration played nearly 1,000 shows across the world following the release of their hugely successful Away from the Sun album. In 2005, when Adair was hired full-time by Nickelback, Greg Upchurch (Puddle of Mudd) joined to play drums full-time. In 2012, original guitarist Matt Roberts departed due to health issues. Chet Roberts, who was formerly Chris Henderson's guitar tech, took his spot. In 2013, Harrell was ejected from the band after being charged with vehicular homicide. Bassist Justin Biltonen replaced him. The band rose to international fame with their first single, \"Kryptonite\", which charted in the top three on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. The band then signed onto Republic Records and released their debut album, The Better Life, in 2000. The album was the 11th-best-selling album of the year and was certified 6x platinum in the United States. Their second album, Away from the Sun, (2002) continued the band's success; it debuted at No. 8 on the Billboard 200 chart, went multi-platinum in the United States like its predecessor, and spawned the hits \"When I'm Gone\" and \"Here Without You\". The band followed it up by extensive touring for two years before releasing their third album, Seventeen Days, in 2005. The album debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 chart and was certified platinum within its first month of release. Their fourth, self-titled album, 3 Doors Down (2008), also debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 chart. The band's fifth studio album, Time of My Life (2011) debuted at No. 3 at the charts. The band has shared the stage with artists such as Daughtry, Megadeth, Staind, Nickelback, Three Days Grace, Alter Bridge, Breaking Benjamin, Seether, Shinedown, Hinder, Mentors, ZZ Top, and Lynyrd Skynyrd. Since the start of their career, 3 Doors Down have sold over 20 million albums worldwide."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Bad Brains are an American hardcore punk band formed in Washington, D.C., in 1977. They are widely regarded as among the pioneers of hardcore punk, though the band's members have objected to this term to describe their music. They are also an adept reggae band, while later recordings featured elements of other genres like funk, heavy metal, hip hop and soul. Bad Brains are followers of the Rastafari movement. Originally formed as a jazz fusion ensemble under the name Mind Power, Bad Brains developed a very fast and intense punk rock sound which came to be labeled \"hardcore\", and was often played faster and more emphatically than the music of many of their peers. The unique factor of the band's music was the fact that they played more complex rhythms than other hardcore punk bands, also adapting non-punk style guitar riffs and solos into their songs. Bad Brains have released nine studio albums (one of which is entirely composed of instrumental versions of their past material). The band broke up and reformed several times over the years, sometimes with different singers or drummers. Since 1998, the \"classic\" lineup of singer H.R. (Human Rights), guitarist Dr. Know, bassist Darryl Jenifer, and drummer Earl Hudson (H.R.'s younger brother) has reunited, albeit performing sporadically."@en ;

The band departed from this style on their fifth album, Hammerheart (1990), which is often cited as the first Viking metal album[citation needed]. Bathory continued in the Viking metal style throughout the 1990s and early 2000s, although the band returned to thrash metal with the albums Requiem (1994) and Octagon (1995).

	dbo:abstract	"Boyz II Men is an American R&B vocal group, best known for emotional ballads and a cappella harmonies. Formerly a quartet featuring Michael McCary, they are currently a trio composed of baritone Nathan Morris alongside tenors Wanya Morris and Shawn Stockman. During the 1990s, Boyz II Men found fame on Motown Records as a quartet. McCary left the group in 2003 due to health issues. During the 1990s, Boyz II Men gained international success. This began with the release of the number one single \"End of the Road\" in 1992, which reached the top of charts worldwide. \"End of the Road\" would set a new record for longevity, staying at number one on the Billboard Hot 100 for thirteen weeks, breaking the decades-old record held by Elvis Presley. Boyz II Men proceeded to break this record with the subsequent releases of \"I'll Make Love to You\" and \"One Sweet Day\" (with Mariah Carey), which, at fourteen and sixteen weeks respectively, each set new records for the total number of weeks at number one. \"I'll Make Love to You\" also topped the charts in Australia (for four weeks) and garnered international success. As of 2015, \"One Sweet Day\" still holds the all-time record with sixteen weeks at the top of the Hot 100. Consequently, Boyz II Men are top ranking members with regard to time spent at number one in Billboard history, ranking in the fourth spot with 50 weeks (as of 2014). Furthermore, when \"On Bended Knee\" took the number 1 spot away from \"I'll Make Love to You\", Boyz II Men became only the third artists ever (after The Beatles and Presley) to replace themselves at the top of the Billboard Hot 100. Boyz II Men are among a select group of artists that have held at the number-one spot for at least 50 weeks cumulatively, placing them just fourth on that list behind Elvis Presley, The Beatles, and Mariah Carey. These achievements were enough to earn Boyz II Men recognition as Billboard magazine's fourth most successful musical group of the 1990s. Boyz II Men continue to perform worldwide, as a trio. Their most recent studio album, Collide, was released in 2014."@en ;

They were a successful band of the 1980s and a leading band in the MTV-driven \"Second British Invasion\" of the US. Since the 1980s, they have placed 14 singles in the Top 10 of the UK Singles Chart and 21 in the Billboard Hot 100, and have sold over 70 million records. While they were generally considered part of the New Romantic scene, along with bands such as Spandau Ballet, when they first emerged, the band later shed this image. The band worked with fashion designers to build a sharp and elegant image. The band has won a number of awards throughout their career: two Brit Awards including the 2004 award for Outstanding Contribution to Music, two Grammy Awards, and an MTV Video Music Award for Lifetime Achievement. They were also awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. The band's controversial videos, which included partial nudity and suggestions of sexuality, became popular in the early 1980s on the then-new music video channel, MTV. Duran Duran were among the first bands to have their videos shot by professional directors with 35 mm film movie cameras, which gave their videos a much more polished look than was standard at the time. In 1984, the band were early innovators with video technology in their live stadium shows. The group was formed by keyboardist Nick Rhodes and bassist John Taylor, with the later addition of drummer Roger Taylor, and after numerous personnel changes, guitarist Andy Taylor and lead singer Simon Le Bon. These five members featured in their most commercially successful line-up. The group has never disbanded, but after separation of Andy Taylor in 1986, the line-up has changed to include former Missing Persons guitarist Warren Cuccurullo from 1989 to 2001 and drummer Sterling Campbell from 1989 to 1991. The reunion of the original five members in the early 2000s created a stir among the band's fans and music media. Andy Taylor left the band once again in mid-2006, and guitarist Dom Brown has since been working with the band as a session player and touring member."@en ;

Live's original lead singer Ed Kowalczyk left the band in November 2009. Live achieved worldwide success with their 1994 album, Throwing Copper, which has sold eight million copies in the U.S. The band had a string of hit singles in the mid-1990s including \"Lightning Crashes\", which stayed at the top of the Billboard Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks chart for 10 consecutive weeks and the Modern Rock Tracks (now Alternative Songs) chart for nine weeks from February 25 to April 22, 1995. The band has sold over 20 million albums worldwide. Their last three studio albums fared only moderately well in the U.S., but they continued to enjoy success in The Netherlands, South Africa, Australasia and Brazil. When touring, Live have used additional musicians, most notably Ed's younger brother Adam Kowalczyk on rhythm guitar and backing vocals. British keyboard player Michael \"Railo\" Railton and guitarist Christopher Thorn of the band Blind Melon have also toured with Live. On November 30, 2009, Taylor revealed that what had initially been termed a \"two-year hiatus\" was more likely the end of the band, due to what he felt were inappropriate actions by Ed Kowalczyk, which have resulted in a lawsuit being filed against him by the other three band members. Kowalczyk alleged that he wrote most of the music for Live and a new publishing arrangement had been accepted by all members of the group in 2006. In June 2011, Taylor revealed that he, Gracey and Dahlheimer were to reform Live without Kowalczyk, who confirmed that he would not work with the other three again. In March 2012, Shinn, formerly of the band Unified Theory, replaced Kowalczyk as lead singer. The band's first album featuring Shinn, The Turn, was released on October 28, 2014."@en ;

Still active today, along with Fairport Convention, they are amongst the best known acts of the British folk revival, and were among the most commercially successful, thanks to their hit singles \"Gaudete\" and \"All Around My Hat\". They had three Top 40 albums; they achieved a certified gold record with sales of \"All Around My Hat\". Throughout their history, Steeleye Span have seen many personnel changes but have maintained a strong continuity of tradition. Their typical album is a collection of mostly traditional songs with one or two instrumental tracks of jigs and/or reels added; the traditional songs often include some of the Child ballads. In their later albums there has been an increased tendency to include music written by the band members, but they have never got completely away from traditional music, which draws upon pan-British traditions."@en ;

dbr:The_Drifters	rdf:type	dbo:Band ;
	dbo:abstract	"The Drifters are a long-lasting American doo-wop and R&B/soul vocal group. They were originally formed to serve as a backing group for Clyde McPhatter (of Billy Ward & the Dominoes) in 1953. According to Rolling Stone magazine, the Drifters were the least stable of the great vocal groups, as they were low-paid musicians hired by George Treadwell, who owned the Drifters name. There have been 60 vocalists in the history of the Treadwell Drifters line, including several splinter groups by former Drifters members (not under Treadwell's management). These groups are usually identified with a possessive credit such as \"Bill Pinkney's Original Drifters\", \"Charlie Thomas' Drifters\", etc. There were three Golden eras of the Drifters; the early 1950s, the 1960s, and the early 1970s (post-Atlantic period). From these, the first Drifters, formed by Clyde McPhatter, was inducted into the Vocal Group Hall of Fame as \"The Drifters\". The second Drifters, featuring Ben E. King, was separately inducted into the Vocal Group Hall of Fame as \"Ben E. King and the Drifters\". In their induction, the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame selected four members from the first Drifters, two from the second Drifters, and one from the post-Atlantic Drifters. According to the Vocal Group Hall of Fame: \"Through turmoil and changes, the (original) Drifters managed to set musical trends and give the public 13 chart hits, most of which are legendary recordings today.\" Matching that feat, subsequent formations of the Drifters recorded 13 Billboard Hot 100 top 30 chart hits. A 1970s revival in Britain, with both old and new material, was not matched in the United States, although it saw their biggest successes on the UK pop charts, peaking with the #2 hit \"Kissin' in the Back Row of the Movies\"."@en ;

The Experience reformed in 1970, with Billy Cox on bass, until Hendrix's death in September. Redding died in 2003, and Mitchell died in November 2008. Widely recognized as hugely influential in the development of the hard rock, psychedelic rock and heavy metal music genres during the late 1960s and beyond, the Jimi Hendrix Experience was best known for the skill, style and charisma of their frontman, Hendrix, who has since been called one of the greatest guitarists of all time by various music publications and writers. All three of the band's studio albums, Are You Experienced (1967), Axis: Bold as Love (1967) and Electric Ladyland (1968), were featured in the top 100 of the Rolling Stone list of The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time, at positions 15, 82 and 54 respectively.

Founded as the Primettes in Detroit, Michigan, in 1959, the Supremes were the most commercially successful of Motown's acts and are, to date, America's most successful vocal group with 12 number one singles on the Billboard Hot 100. Most of these hits were written and produced by Motown's main songwriting and production team, Holland\u2013Dozier\u2013Holland. At their peak in the mid-1960s, the Supremes rivaled the Beatles in worldwide popularity, and it is said that their success made it possible for future African American R&B and soul musicians to find mainstream success. Founding members Florence Ballard, Mary Wilson, Diana Ross, and Betty McGlown, all from the Brewster-Douglass public housing project in Detroit, formed the Primettes as the sister act to the Primes (with Paul Williams and Eddie Kendricks, who went on to form the Temptations). Barbara Martin replaced McGlown in 1960, and the group signed with Motown the following year as the Supremes. Martin left the act in early 1962, and Ross, Ballard, and Wilson carried on as a trio. During the mid-1960s, the Supremes achieved mainstream success with Ross as lead singer. In 1967, Motown president Berry Gordy renamed the group Diana Ross & the Supremes, and replaced Ballard with Cindy Birdsong. Ross left to pursue a solo career in 1970 and was replaced by Jean Terrell, at which point the group's name reverted to the Supremes. After 1972, the lineup changed more frequently; Lynda Laurence, Scherrie Payne, and Susaye Greene all became members of the group during the mid-1970s. The Supremes disbanded in 1977 after 18 years."@en ;

dbr:The_Temptations	rdf:type	dbo:Band ;
	dbo:abstract	"The Temptations are an American vocal group known for their success with Motown Records during the 1960s and 1970s. Known for their choreography, distinct harmonies, and flashy wardrobe, the group was highly influential to the evolution of R&B and soul music. Having sold tens of millions of albums, the Temptations are one of the most successful groups in music history. As of 2015, the Temptations continue to perform with one living original member, Otis Williams, still in the lineup. Featuring five male vocalists and dancers (save for brief periods with less or more members), the group formed in 1960 in Detroit, Michigan under the name \"The Elgins\". The original founding members were originally members of two rival Detroit vocal groups: Otis Williams, Elbridge \"Al\" Bryant, and Melvin Franklin of Otis Williams & the Distants, and Eddie Kendricks and Paul Williams of the Primes. In 1964, Bryant was replaced by David Ruffin, who was the lead vocalist on a number of the group's biggest hits, including \"My Girl\" (1964), \"Ain't Too Proud to Beg\" (1966), and \"I Wish It Would Rain\" (1967). Ruffin was replaced in 1968 by Dennis Edwards, with whom the group continued to record hit records such as \"Cloud Nine\" (1969) and \"Ball of Confusion (That's What the World is Today)\" (1970). The group's lineup has changed frequently since the departures of Kendricks and Paul Williams from the act in 1971. Later members of the group have included singers such as Richard Street, Damon Harris, Ron Tyson, and Ali-Ollie Woodson, with whom the group scored a late-period hit in 1984 with \"Treat Her Like a Lady\". Over the course of their career, the Temptations have released four Billboard Hot 100 number-one singles and fourteen R&B number-one singles, and their material has earned them three Grammy Awards. The Temptations were the first Motown recording act to win a Grammy Award - for \"Cloud Nine\" in 1969 - and in 2013 received the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award. Six of the Temptations (Edwards, Franklin, Kendricks, Ruffin, Otis Williams and Paul Williams) were inducted to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1989. Three classic Temptations songs, \"My Girl\", \"Just My Imagination (Running Away with Me)\", and \"Papa Was a Rollin' Stone\", are among The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll. The Temptations were also ranked at number 68 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 100 Greatest Artists of all time."@en ;

Of the early members only Escalante has remained through all subsequent incarnations of the band. The current lineup of Escalante, Dave Quackenbush, Warren Fitzgerald, and Josh Freese has remained intact since 1990 and is generally considered far removed from the band's early 1980s incarnation. Since 2002 Escalante has released all of the band's albums through his Kung Fu Records label, with Fitzgerald generally producing."@en ;

Violent Femmes went on to become one of the most successful alternative rock bands of the 1980s, selling over 9 million albums by 2005. After the release of their third album The Blind Leading the Naked (1986), the band's future was uncertain and they split up in 1987, when Gano and Ritchie went solo. However, they regrouped a year later, releasing the album 3 (1989). Since then, Violent Femmes' popularity continued to grow, especially in the United States where the songs \"Nightmares\" and \"American Music\" cracked the top five on the Modern Rock Tracks chart."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Damageplan was an American heavy metal band from Dallas, Texas, formed in 2003. Following the demise of their previous group Pantera, brothers Dimebag Darrell and Vinnie Paul Abbott wanted to start a new band. The pair recruited former Diesel Machine and Halford guitarist Pat Lachman on vocals, and later Bob Zilla on bass. Damageplan released their only studio album New Found Power in the United States on February 10, 2004, which debuted at number 38 on the Billboard 200, selling 44,676 copies in its first week. While Damageplan was promoting the album at a concert on December 8, 2004 at the Alrosa Villa in Columbus, Ohio, a man named Nathan Gale climbed on stage and killed lead guitarist Darrell and three others, and wounding another seven, before being shot dead by police officer James Niggemeyer. Although no motive was found, some witnesses claimed Gale blamed the brothers for Pantera's breakup and believed that they had stolen his lyrics. The band's manager confirmed there are unreleased Damageplan recordings, although they have not surfaced, and the band has not performed since the incident. Abbott and Zilla have joined the band Hellyeah, and Lachman joined The Mercy Clinic."@en ;

The band was formed in 1999 by guitarist Ole Petter Andreassen (also a member of The Cumshots and Black Debbath), under the stage name El Doom. He was joined by his Black Debbath colleague, bass player Egil Hegerberg, using the name Angelov Doom, as well as singer Papa Doom guitarist Doom Perignon and drummer Fast Winston Doom. The band's music is somewhat similar to stoner rock legends Kyuss and early Black Sabbath. The band's debut release She Fucks Me was released in 2000. The five-track EP has a picture of Bill Clinton on the cover. Thulsa Doom have since released three full-length albums. One of their trademarks is very long and strange album titles. Singer Papa Doom left the band in 2003, and guitarist Doom Perignon is now the band's singer. The band's latest album Keyboard, Oh Lord! Why Don't We? is a bit less heavy and more melodic than the previous albums. Their cover version of Beach Boys's Tears in the Morning was a minor TV hit in Norway in the summer of 2005 with a video directed by Jarle Medhus."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"10cc are an English art rock band founded in Stockport who achieved their greatest commercial success in the 1970s. The band initially consisted of four musicians\u2014Graham Gouldman, Eric Stewart, Kevin Godley, and Lol Creme\u2014who had written and recorded together for some three years, before assuming the name \"10cc\" in 1972. 10cc featured two songwriting teams, one \"commercial\" and one \"artistic\". Stewart and Gouldman were predominantly pop-songwriters, who created most of the band's accessible songs. By way of contrast, Godley and Creme were the predominantly experimental half of 10cc, featuring an Art School sensibility and cinematic inspired writing. Every member of 10cc was a multi-instrumentalist, singer, writer and producer, and the writing teams frequently switched partners, so that Godley/Gouldman or Creme/Stewart compositions were not uncommon. After Godley and Creme left the band in 1976, Gouldman and Stewart were the main creative forces behind 10cc. Stewart left the band in 1996, and Gouldman continues to lead a touring version of 10cc. Most of the band's albums were recorded at their own Strawberry Studios (North) in Stockport and Strawberry Studios (South) in Dorking, with most of those engineered by Stewart. 10cc were co-managed by Ric Dixon and Harvey Lisberg at Kennedy Street, who had represented the individual members of the band since the mid-1960s."@en ;

The final line-up of this first incarnation \u2013 Dave Barbarossa, Matthew Ashman and Leigh Gorman \u2013 left the band in January 1980 at the suggestion of then-de facto manager Malcolm McLaren, to form the instrumentalist personnel of the controversial Bow Wow Wow.

All their albums were released by SST Records. The first line-up was Meghrouni, bass guitarist Bill Crawford and saxophonist Tony Atherton. This lineup of Bazooka record three albums: \"Perfectly Square\", \"Blowhole\", and \"Cigars, Oyster and Booze.\" Songwriting was split about evenly between the trio's members, with a healthy dose of jazz standards written by the likes of Thelonious Monk, Sonny Rollins and Lee Morgan. The music was generally in a bebop or hard bop vein, though a few pieces were freely improvised, and there was a strong punk rock or hard rock quality, particularly in Crawford's playing. In his review of 1994's Blowhole, Richard Foss wrote, \"It is difficult to articulate just what makes Bazooka such an interesting band and Blowhole such a fine album. There are other bands that play jazz with rock fervor and wild abandon, but few who do so with anything approaching this level of pure musicianship.\" However, in December 1994, Atherton decided to leave the band, followed shortly thereafter by Crawford. Meghrouni used the Bazooka name with a new quartet, consisting of Meghrouni retaining his position as a drummer, pianist Don Carroll, guitarist Jeremy Keller and bass guitarist Steve Reed. Keller was the primary composer, and the new line-up had a very different sound, more in line with funk and jazz fusion. Sonic Business Environment -- apparently Bazook's final record\u2014earned positive reviews, and even appeared on a few jazz radio charts."@en ;

Closely linked to the CKY Crew, which features Margera's brother Bam, the band found initial recognition through its musical contributions to the CKY video series and the TV series Jackass. Originally known by the full name Camp Kill Yourself, and later credited briefly as simply Camp, the band released its debut album Volume 1 in 1999, largely made up of material recorded for the CKY films. The group later signed with The Island Def Jam Music Group and released Infiltrate\u2022Destroy\u2022Rebuild in 2002, which gave the band its first experience of US chart success. An Answer Can Be Found followed in 2005, with latest studio album Carver City released by Roadrunner Records in 2009. CKY has been categorised as a band of multiple musical genres, including alternative metal, post-grunge and skate punk. The band's songwriting was typically led by Miller, with production, engineering and mixing handled by Ginsburg. In recent years, internal tensions between band members have halted progress on new material and touring; Ginsburg, Margera and Deis have retained the CKY name, while Miller has returned to using the Foreign Objects moniker, as well as that of MechaCKY."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Cancer Bats are a Canadian hardcore punk band from Toronto, Ontario. They have released five studio albums and six extended plays. The band is composed of vocalist Liam Cormier, guitarist Scott Middleton, drummer Mike Peters and bassist Jaye R. Schwarzer. Cancer Bats take a wide variety of influences from heavy metal subgenres and fuse them into hardcore and punk rock, and also include elements of Southern rock. Their sound has thus been likened to sludge metal, as well as to that of metalcore bands such as Converge and Hatebreed. The members of Cancer Bats have also toured and recorded as a Black Sabbath cover band under the name Bat Sabbath."@en ;

dbr:Carter_Family	rdf:type	dbo:Band ;
	dbo:abstract	"The Carter Family was a traditional American folk music group that recorded between 1927 and 1956. Their music had a profound impact on bluegrass, country, Southern Gospel, pop and rock musicians as well as on the U.S. folk revival of the 1960s. They were the first vocal group to become country music stars. Their recordings of songs such as \"Wabash Cannonball\", \"Can the Circle Be Unbroken\", \"Wildwood Flower\", \"Keep On the Sunny Side\" and \"I'm Thinking Tonight of My Blue Eyes\" made these songs country standards. The latter's tune was used for Roy Acuff's \"The Great Speckled Bird\", Hank Thompson's \"The Wild Side of Life\" and Kitty Wells' \"It Wasn't God Who Made Honky Tonk Angels\", making the song a hit all over again in other incarnations. The original group consisted of Alvin Pleasant \"A.P.\" Delaney Carter (1891\u20131960), his wife Sara Dougherty Carter (1898\u20131979), and his sister-in-law Maybelle Addington Carter (1909\u20131978). Maybelle was married to A.P.'s brother Ezra (Eck) Carter, and was also Sara's first cousin. All three were born and raised in southwestern Virginia, where they were immersed in the tight harmonies of mountain gospel music and shape note singing. Throughout the group's career, Sara Carter sang lead vocals; Maybelle sang harmony and accompanied the group instrumentally; on some songs A.P. did not perform at all but at times sang harmony and background vocals and, once in a while, lead vocal. Maybelle's distinctive guitar playing style became a hallmark of the group."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"The Doug Anthony All Stars (or Doug Anthony Allstars, DAAS, D.A.A.S. or stylised as D\u22C6A\u2020A\u262DS) are an Australian musical comedy, alternative rock and vocal group who initially performed together between 1984 and 1994. The band is an acoustic trio, originally comprising Paul McDermott and Tim Ferguson on main vocals and Richard Fidler on guitar and backing vocals. The 2014 DAAS Live reformation tour features Paul Livingston (aka Flacco) on guitar and vibes. DAAS are known for their aggressive, provocative style; their habit of involving audience members and their tendency to attack topical and sometimes controversial issues in their comedy. DAAS began performing as buskers on the streets of Canberra in 1984, while they were attending university. After winning the Pick of the Fringe award at the 1986 Adelaide Fringe Festival, the group relocated from Canberra to Melbourne, but it was not until they travelled to the Edinburgh Festival Fringe in 1987 that they first achieved success. They quickly gained popularity in the United Kingdom, where they made numerous television appearances, but remained virtually unknown in Australia until 1989 when they were made regular performers on the Australian comedy show The Big Gig. These appearances gained them recognition, and they remained a popular feature of the show until 1991 when they left to create their own ABC comedy series, DAAS Kapital. The group have released four live recordings and one studio album, DAAS Icon, which achieved some independent success in Australia but was briefly banned in Britain. They also released a collection of dark short stories in 1989, entitled Book, which took a markedly different tone from their comedic stage performances. They also made two live concert videos and one film, The Edinburgh Years. The group split up in 1994, following a final farewell tour of Australia. Although they reunited in 2003 to perform together at a benefit concert, were interviewed together in 2008 in support of their DVD, and reunited for a one-off show to launch the DAAS Kapital DVD in 2013, the three ruled out the suggestion of a reunion tour at the time. In December 2013, McDermott and Ferguson announced they would be performing \"as DAAS\" for the group's 30th anniversary, at the Canberra Comedy Festival in March 2014, with Paul Livingston performing the role of Fidler. This current line-up has announced subsequent shows in Hobart, Melbourne, Wollongong, Perth, Brisbane and Bendigo, with more dates to follow."@en ;

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dragon_(band)>	rdf:type	dbo:Band ;
	dbo:abstract	"Dragon are a rock band which were formed in Auckland, New Zealand in January 1972 and relocated to Sydney, Australia in May 1975. They were originally fronted by singer Marc Hunter and are currently led by his brother, bass player/vocalist Todd Hunter. They performed and released material under the name Hunter in Europe and the United States during 1987. Keyboard player Paul Hewson wrote or co-wrote most of the group's 1970s hits: \"April Sun in Cuba\" peaked at #2 on the 1977 Australian singles chart; \"Are You Old Enough?\" reached #1 in 1978; and \"Still in Love with You\" reached #15 also in 1978. Later hits, from when the band re-grouped in the 1980s, were written by other band members, often working with outside associates: The Hunter brothers, with Todd's partner, Johanna Pigott, wrote \"Rain,\" a #2 hit in 1983, while other, more minor hits were written by the Hunters and/or Alan Mansfield, frequently in collaboration with any combination of Pigott, Mansfield's partner Sharon O'Neill, Marc Hunter's partner Wendy Hunter, or producers Todd Rundgren and David Hirschfelder. The name Dragon came from a consultation of I Ching cards by early band vocalist Graeme Collins. Dragon have endured tragedy, adversity and notoriety, and during the course of the band's earlier career, several members died from drug-related causes. Problems began soon after their arrival in Sydney in late 1975, when all their equipment was stolen. Several months later, in 1976, drummer Neil Storey died of a heroin overdose; Paul Hewson of a drug overdose in 1985 and Marc Hunter of smoking-related oesophageal cancer in 1998. Several members of the group including Hewson and Marc Hunter were heavy heroin users during the band's heyday, and The Stewart Royal Commission (1980\u20131983) which investigated the Mr. Asia drug syndicate obtained evidence that Dragon members were clients. Two members were involved in a serious car crash in 1977, where Paul Hewson's neck was in a brace as well as having a broken arm and Robert Taylor needed plastic surgery, and Hewson also suffered from debilitating scoliosis and arthritis, the pain of which reportedly contributed to his heroin use. The band also undertook a famously disastrous 1978 tour of the USA, supporting Johnny Winter, which ended when Marc Hunter abused the Texan audience as \"faggots\" and the band were pelted off stage, while Winter's band were said to have taken bets about how long it would be before Hunter was shot. On 1 July 2008, the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) recognised Dragon's iconic status when they were inducted into the ARIA Hall of Fame."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Kobus! (or K.O.B.U.S!) is an Afrikaans extreme metal band formed in 2000 by ex-Springbok Nude Girls guitarist Theo Crous and ex-Voice of Destruction vocalist Francois Breytenbach Blom. They performed as a duo until 2004 when they were joined by Rob Nel on bass and Paul Andr\u00E9 Blom on drums. In 2007 Rob Nel was replaced on bass by Pierre Tredoux and in 2008 drummer Paul Andre Blom was replaced by Werner Von Waltsleben. The band has released three albums: The self-titled debut Kobus! in 2002, 100% Skuldgevoelvry' in 2004, and Swaar Metaal in 2007. The first two releases contained an eclectic mix of styles, crossing genres from track to track. The album Swaar Metaal, which won the 'Best Afrikaans Rock Album' award at the 2008 South African Music Awards, is sonically more uniform than its predecessors, an Afrikaans-language Heavy Metal album, regarded as a first in Afrikaans music."@en ;

However, their imaginative, pioneering usage of electronic instruments and sampling drew mostly from post-punk, ska, hip hop and vintage film soundtracks.

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pennywise_(band)>	rdf:type	dbo:Band ;
	dbo:abstract	"Pennywise is an American punk rock band from Hermosa Beach, California, United States, formed in 1988. The name is derived from the monster, It, from the Stephen King novel of the same title. Between their 1991 self-titled debut and 2005's The Fuse, Pennywise had released an album every two years on Epitaph Records, a label owned by Bad Religion guitarist Brett Gurewitz. To date, the band has released eleven full-length studio albums (the last being 2014's Yesterdays), one live album, two EPs and one DVD. Although their first two studio albums were critically acclaimed, Pennywise would not experience worldwide commercial success until the 1995 release of their third studio album, About Time, which peaked at number ninety-six on the Billboard 200, and number fifty-five on Australia's ARIA Charts. The band's mainstream success was signified by a growing interest in punk rock during the 1990s, along with fellow California bands NOFX, Rancid, Blink-182, Bad Religion, Green Day, The Offspring and Sublime. By 2007, the band had independently sold over 3 million records worldwide, making them one of the most successful independent punk acts of all time. Pennywise's current line-up consists of Jim Lindberg (vocals), Fletcher Dragge (guitars), Randy Bradbury (bass) and Byron McMackin (drums). They had kept their original line-up together until bassist Jason Thirsk died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound in 1996, due to issues with his alcoholism, after which Bradbury joined as his replacement. In August 2009, Lindberg decided to leave the band; he was replaced in February 2010 by Ignite singer Zoli T\u00E9gl\u00E1s. With T\u00E9gl\u00E1s, the band recorded their tenth studio album All or Nothing, which was released on May 1, 2012. Lindberg rejoined the band later that year after T\u00E9gl\u00E1s was sidelined by a back injury."@en ;

dbr:The_Derek_Trucks_Band	rdf:type	dbo:Band ;
	dbo:abstract	"The Derek Trucks Band is an American jam band founded by young slide guitar prodigy, Derek Trucks, who began playing guitar and touring with some of blues and rock music's elite when he was just nine years old. After experimenting as an adolescent with musicians he met between tours and recording sessions, Trucks founded The Derek Trucks Band in 1994. With family ties to The Allman Brothers Band, Trucks continued to experiment and play with others, carefully assembling his own band over a period of several years. Loosely based in his family home in Jacksonville, Florida, with Trucks as unquestionable bandleader, the band is made up of six individuals. The band has drawn upon the wide variety of the influences and musical preferences of its band members. Together, they have gained increasing public notice and critical acclaim for developing a unique sound of their own. Melding together blues, southern rock, jazz, rhythm and blues, gospel, soul, funk with Hindustani classical music, afro-beat and world fusion, the band has released nine albums as of 2009. Increasingly, the bandmates have combined their talents to perform pieces from some of the most highly regarded musicians before them, while at the same time collaborating on writing the songs they have recorded. Their sound has become, with maturity, a way for Trucks to explore his own creativity. Rather than focus all his energy into his increasing role as a guest (and eventually, a permanent membership in The Allman Brothers Band) Trucks has nurtured a different eclectic sound as bandleader of what is now The Derek Trucks Band."@en ;

dbr:Van_der_Graaf_Generator	rdf:type	dbo:Band ;
	dbo:abstract	"Van der Graaf Generator are an English progressive rock band, formed in 1967 in Manchester by singer-songwriters Peter Hammill and Chris Judge Smith and the first act signed by Charisma Records. They did not experience much commercial success in the UK, but became popular in Italy during the 1970s. In 2005 the band reformed, and continue to perform as of 2014. The band formed at Manchester University, but settled in London where they signed with Charisma. They went through a number of incarnations in their early years, including a brief split in 1969. When they reformed, they found minor commercial success with The Least We Can Do Is Wave to Each Other, and after the follow-up album, H to He, Who Am the Only One, stabilised around a line-up of Hammill, organist Hugh Banton, saxophonist David Jackson, and drummer Guy Evans. The quartet subsequently achieved significant success in Italy with the release of Pawn Hearts in 1971. After several exhausting tours of Italy, the band split in 1972. They reformed in 1975, releasing Godbluff and frequently touring Italy again, before a major line-up change and a slight rename to Van der Graaf. The band split in 1978. After many years apart, the band finally united at a gig at the Royal Festival Hall and a short tour in 2005. Since then, the band has continued as a trio of Hammill, Banton, and Evans, who record and tour regularly in between Hammill's concurrent solo career. Their most recent album, ALT, was released in June 2012. The group's albums have tended to be both lyrically and musically darker in atmosphere than many of their prog-rock peers (a trait they shared with King Crimson, whose guitarist Robert Fripp guested on two of their albums), and guitar solos were the exception rather than the rule, preferring to use Banton's classically influenced organ, and, until his departure, Jackson's multiple saxophones. While Hammill is the primary songwriter for the band, and its members have contributed to his solo albums, he is keen to stress that the band collectively arranges all its material. Hammill's lyrics frequently covered themes of mortality, due to his love of science fiction writers such as Robert Heinlein and Philip K. Dick, along with his self-confessed warped and obsessive nature. His voice has been a distinctive component of the band throughout its career. It has been described as \"a male Nico\" and would later on be cited as an influence by Goth bands in the 1980s. Though the group have generally been commercially unsuccessful outside of early 1970s Italy, they have inspired several musicians, including John Lydon and Julian Cope."@en ;

dbr:Blink-182	rdf:type	dbo:Band ;
	dbo:abstract	"Blink-182 (often stylized as blink-182) is an American rock band formed in Poway, a suburb of San Diego, California in 1992. The band currently consists of bassist and vocalist Mark Hoppus and drummer Travis Barker with guitarist and vocalist Matt Skiba as a touring and session member. Blink-182 is considered a key group in the development of pop punk; the band's combination of pop melodies with fast-paced punk rock featured a more radio-friendly accessibility than prior bands. Founded by Hoppus, guitarist and vocalist Tom DeLonge, and drummer Scott Raynor, the band emerged from the Southern California punk scene of the early 1990s and first gained notoriety for high-energy live shows and irreverent lyrical toilet humor. The band was initially known as Blink until Irish band Blink threatened legal action; the band appended \"-182\". Cheshire Cat (1995) led the band to tour with Pennywise and NOFX on the Warped Tour. Dude Ranch (1997) was co-distributed by major label MCA Records and featured the band's first rock radio hit, \"Dammit (Growing Up)\". Raynor was fired midway through a 1998 tour and replaced by Barker. Enema of the State (1999) was an enormous success on the strength of hit singles \"What's My Age Again?\", \"Adam's Song\" and \"All the Small Things\", which enjoyed massive airplay and became MTV staples. Take Off Your Pants and Jacket (2001) reached number one in the United States, Canada, and Germany. The eponymously titled Blink-182 followed in 2003 and marked a stylistic shift for the group, infusing experimental elements into the group's usual pop punk formula, resulting in a more mature sound. DeLonge left the group in 2005, sending the band into what was termed an \"indefinite hiatus\". The trio reunited in 2009, producing the band's sixth album, Neighborhoods (2011). In 2015, DeLonge again exited, and was replaced by Alkaline Trio guitarist and vocalist Matt Skiba. Blink-182 has sold over twelve million albums in the United States, and over 35 million albums worldwide. In 2011, The New York Times asserted, \"no punk band of the 1990s has been more influential than Blink-182,\" and even as the band receded after its 2005 split, \"its sound and style could be heard in the muscular pop punk of Fall Out Boy or in the current wave of high-gloss Warped Tour punk bands, like All Time Low and The Maine.\""@en ;

The duo worked together on a series of releases before Balance chose the name Coil, which he claimed to be inspired by the omnipresence of the coil's shape in nature. Today, Coil remains one of the most influential and best-known industrial music groups. The group's first official release as Coil was a 1984 12\" album titled How to Destroy Angels released on the Belgian Les Disques du Cr\u00E9puscule's sublabel LAYLAH Antirecords. Following the 12\"s success, Some Bizarre Records produced two albums, Scatology, Horse Rotorvator and Coil departed SomeBizzare Label and Produced Love's Secret Domain, which met with little commercial success, but were praised as innovative due to their blend of industrial music and acid house. In 1985, the group began working on a series of soundtracks, amongst them music for the first Hellraiser movie based on the novel The Hellbound Heart by their acquaintance at that time, Clive Barker. The group's first live performance in 16 years occurred in 1999, and began a series of mini-tours that would last until 2004. Following the death of John Balance on 13 November 2004, Christopherson announced via their official record label website Threshold House that Coil as an entity had ceased to exist."@en ;

They are not to be confused with Los Angeles thrash metal band Dark Angel. Death Angel has released seven studio albums, two demo tapes, one box set and two live albums. The underground success of Death Angel's first two studio albums, The Ultra-Violence (1987) and Frolic Through the Park (1988), attracted the attention of Geffen Records, which signed the quintet in 1989. Their 1990 follow-up album, Act III, was also successful. While Death Angel was touring in support of Act III, drummer Andy Galeon was injured in a tour bus accident and needed more than a year to fully recover. This resulted in the band's break up in 1991. However, Death Angel reformed in 2001 (without original guitarist Gus Pepa) at the Thrash of the Titans benefit concert for Testament singer Chuck Billy. The band continues to record and perform today, and their eighth studio album The Evil Divide will be released on May 27, 2016."@en ;

A Wreckage demo called \"Green\" and Ibex's live cover of The Beatles' \"Rain\" would later appear on Mercury's posthumous solo box set in 2000. Live recordings exist of \"Crossroads\", \"Communication Breakdown\", \"Jailhouse Rock\", and \"We're Going Wrong\", but they have never been officially released.

Formed in 1997, the band's original line-up consisted of Paul Banks (vocals, rhythm guitar), Daniel Kessler (lead guitar, vocals), Carlos Dengler (bass guitar, keyboards) and Greg Drudy (drums, percussion). Drudy left the band in 2000 and was replaced by Sam Fogarino. In 2010, shortly after recording finished for the band's fourth album, Dengler left to pursue personal projects. Having first performed at Luna Lounge along with other notable bands like The Strokes, Longwave, The National and Stellastarr, they are one of the bands associated with the New York City indie music scene, and was one of several groups that emerged from the post-punk revival of the 2000s. The band's sound is generally a mix of staccato bass and rhythmic, harmonized guitar, with a snare heavy mix, drawing comparisons to post-punk bands such as Joy Division and The Chameleons. Aside from the lyrics, their songwriting method includes all of the band members, rather than relying on any given chief songwriter. The band's debut album Turn on the Bright Lights (2002) was critically acclaimed, making it to tenth position on the NME's list of top albums in 2002 as well as No. 1 on Pitchfork Media's Top 50 Albums of 2002. Subsequent records Antics (2004) and Our Love to Admire (2007) brought them greater critical and commercial success. The band released its fourth, self-titled album on September 7, 2010. The band went on hiatus from 2011 through 2012 while they focused on other projects. Their fifth studio album El Pintor was released on September 9, 2014."@en ;

The name Kula Shaker was itself inspired by King Kulasekhara, an Indian emperor from the 8th century. In addition, many of the band's songs feature traditional Indian instruments, such as the sitar, tamboura, and tabla, juxtaposed with guitar-heavy, Western rock instrumentation. Kula Shaker disbanded in September 1999 but reformed in 2004 for sessions for the School of Braja compilation album. This led to plans for a full comeback, although the reformation was not widely publicised until the beginning of 2006.

	dbo:abstract	"Lock Up was a rock band that featured Tom Morello on guitar before Rage Against the Machine was formed. The band was founded by the original guitar player Mike Livingston (formerly of The Mau-Mau's) and Kevin Wood on bass. They had previously played together in the band Ella and the Blacks, which also included Brian Grillo and Brendan Mullen (founder of The Masque, the first L.A. punk rock club). Grillo became Lock Up's lead singer. Grillo had worked several years before with Martin Atkins in Atkin's Brian Brain project, and then was known in Los Angeles for fronting Brian Grillo's Wild Coyote Review. The original drummer was Michael Lee, (later drummer with Sylvia Juncosa and with The Homebillies ), who quit and was replaced briefly by D. H. Peligro, formerly of the Dead Kennedys and later in Red Hot Chili Peppers. After Peligro left, he was replaced by Vince Ostertag . In early 1987, Lock Up signed a production deal with Third Story Music, which was the company associated with Herb Cohen, by Evan Cohen, who later ran Manifesto Records. Cohen brought the band to the attention of Anna Statman, who was an A & R person at Slash Records. In 1988, Statman moved to a new job at Geffen Records, and Lock Up was her first signing at Geffen, in mid-1988. Livingston had left Lock Up in late 1987. In early 1988, Livingston was replaced by Morello. Chris Beebe on bass completed the lineup that released Lock Up's sole album on Geffen Records, Something Bitchin' This Way Comes, which came out in 1989. The title of the album was based on Ray Bradbury's 1962 novel Something Wicked This Way Comes. Vince Ostertag was subsequently replaced by Jon Knox who played drums until the group disbanded. Following the Lock Up break up, Jon encouraged bassist Tim Commerford and Zack de la Rocha to jam with Tom Morello and drummer Brad Wilk who unsuccessfully auditioned for Lock Up. This line-up went on to form Rage Against the Machine. Most of Morello's guitar with Lock Up is unlike his work with Rage Against the Machine and Audioslave. His solos, in contrast to Livingston's rootsy blues oriented style mainly consist of arpeggios, tapping and overall fast fretwork. Evidence of his experimenting with the toggle switch can be heard in a few tracks (\"Can't Stop the Bleeding\", \"Nothing New\", \"Punch Drunk\"). The songs \"Punch Drunk\" and \"Half Man Half Beast\" were featured in the 1991 comedy film Ski School. In 1997, Manifesto Records licensed the Lock Up album from Geffen, and released it on compact disc. After the release, Manifesto, Morello, and Morello's label, Sony, got into a legal dispute over whether Manifesto could place a sticker on the compact disc that read \"Featuring Tom Morello from Rage Against the Machine.\""@en ;

On the heels of his solo release From the Wood in 1995, the Pat McGee Band signed with Warner Bros. Records subsidiary Giant Records in 1999. Shine, the band's major-label debut, was released in 2000 with the national singles \"Runaway\" and \"Rebecca\". After two years of delays, the band released their second album with Warner, Save Me, in 2004. The band was dropped from the label that year and picked up by Kirtland Records. An enhanced Save Me is now being distributed through Kirtland with the radio single \"Must Have Been Love\". Former guitarist and vocalist Al Walsh left the band in an amicable split at the end of 2001. Keyboardist and vocalist Jonathan Williams left in 2003 but rejoined the band in late 2005. Both were significant contributors to the band's sound, particularly in the form of backing vocals. The band didn't see another background vocalist until the 2003 addition of keyboardist/guitarist Todd Wright. Longtime bassist John Small left the band in 2004. With Jonathan's return, Todd Wright has left the band. Todd is now finding success as the front man of his own band, Getaway Car, where he's backed by guitarist Matt Miceli and Crix Reardon - while still a part of Pat McGee Band - on bass. Drummer Chris Williams died peacefully in his home October 28, 2006. As of June 2007, the band has severed ties with Kirtland Records and is once again recording independently. As of 2008, Matt \"Chew\" Calvarese has increasingly sat in as the band's new drummer."@en ;

Despite achieving only limited commercial success, the band was a major influence on the 1970s punk movement in both the United States and United Kingdom. All of the band members adopted pseudonyms ending with the surname \"Ramone\", although none of them were related. They performed 2,263 concerts, touring virtually nonstop for 22 years.

Recognition of the band's importance built over the years, and they are now mentioned in many assessments of all-time great rock music, such as the Rolling Stone list of the \"100 Greatest Artists of All Time\" and VH1's \"100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock\". In 2002, the Ramones were ranked the second-greatest band of all time by Spin magazine, trailing only the Beatles. On March 18, 2002, the original four members and Tommy's replacement on drums, Marky Ramone, were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.

Led by the husband-and-wife team of Glenn and Wendi Kaiser, the band sought to evangelize using Christian rock, and addressed a variety of social ills in the lyrics of their music. While the group is officially disbanded, they played several one-off dates at the now defunct Cornerstone Festival, which members of the band helped establish. Currently Glenn Kaiser has an established solo career as a blues musician and is also a speaker on various spiritual issues to youth and adults."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Son of Sam is an American horror punk band that is a side project created by Todd Youth in 2000, during his tenure as the guitarist for Danzig. The band's initial line up featured members of Samhain, Danzig, and AFI. Much like its members' other work, Son of Sam plays in the horror punk style, and also infuses metal and deathrock elements into their music. The name of the band was inspired by serial killer David Berkowitz for whom he named himself the Son Of Sam. In 1999, Youth was invited by Glenn Danzig to fill in the guitar position for the Samhain reunion tour, replacing Samhain's original guitarist, Pete \"Damien\" Marshall, who had opted out in order to tour with Iggy Pop. Playing guitar for the Samhain reunion inspired Youth to write an album worth of Samhain influenced music. Youth then contacted Steve Zing and London May (both ex-Samhain members), who were impressed with what Todd had written, and agreed to help him record an album. The project was dubbed \"Son of Sam,\" a nod to the fact that the band was spawned out of the Samhain reunion. Davey Havok, whose band, AFI, had opened for the Samhain reunion tour, was invited to write lyrics and record vocals for the album, since it was well known that Havok was a huge Samhain fan. In a very short amount of time, they recorded an album of 10 tracks called Songs from the Earth and released it on Nitro Records in 2001 . \"To me, doing this record was sort of a tribute to Samhain. Playing guitar for Samhain on the reunion tour was such an honor. I had forgotten how much I love and respect the band,\" Youth stated. The album featured guest guitar and keyboard from Glenn Danzig on the tracks Stray and Songs From The Earth. In December 2007, messages on the Horror High website indicated that a follow up record was being made. Davey Havok did not return on vocals as although he has said numerous times that he would love to make a new Son of Sam album, he is unable to as he is constantly busy with commitments to AFI's record label, Interscope. Todd Youth released a statement saying while Havok would not be doing vocals, he gave the rest of the band his full blessing in seeking a replacement vocalist. Youth enlisted the talents of Chelsea Smiles bandmate Sky Vaughan-Jayne (real name Jonathan Ian Skye Jayne, and in this incarnation, Ian Thorne) to take up Havok's former mantle, and the band signed to Horror High records. The second album \"Into The Night\" was recorded and released in 2008. With the release of the second LP they embarked on a small American tour. They have since ceased activity."@en ;

While the band's early work was mainstream progressive rock, they would enjoy greater commercial success when they incorporated more conventional and radio-friendly elements into their work in the mid-1970s, going on to sell more than 60 million albums. They reached their commercial peak with 1979's Breakfast in America, which has sold more than 20 million copies. Though their albums were generally far more successful than their singles, Supertramp did enjoy a number of major hits throughout the 1970s and 1980s, including Hodgson's songs \"Give a Little Bit\", \"The Logical Song\", \"Take the Long Way Home\", \"Dreamer\", \"Breakfast in America\", \"It's Raining Again\", and Davies' songs, \"Bloody Well Right\", \"Goodbye Stranger\", and \"Cannonball\".

Their music was critically acclaimed as something \"that will melt your face and leave you wanting more.\" The band was formed by Scogin shortly after he left his position of vocalist in Norma Jean. In 2004, a record deal was signed with Solid State Records and a debut album was released, titled Everything Is Alive, Everything Is Breathing, Nothing Is Dead, and Nothing Is Bleeding. The band had toured constantly since then. The Chariot released the Unsung EP in 2005, which was then followed by three successful studio albums: The Fianc\u00E9e in 2007, Wars and Rumors of Wars in 2009, and Long Live in 2010. The band entered the studio in May 2012 to record their fifth full-length album titled One Wing which was released August 28, 2012. The Chariot disbanded following a farewell tour in late 2013."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"The Impressions are an American music group from Chicago, originally formed in 1958. Their repertoire includes doo-wop, gospel, soul, and R&B. The group was founded as The Roosters by Chattanooga, Tennessee natives Sam Gooden, Richard Brooks and Arthur Brooks, who moved to Chicago and added Jerry Butler and Curtis Mayfield to their line-up to become Jerry Butler & the Impressions. By 1962, Butler and the Brookses had departed, and after switching to ABC-Paramount Records, Mayfield, Gooden, and new Impression Fred Cash collectively became a top-selling soul act. Mayfield left the group for a solo career in 1970; Leroy Hutson, Ralph Johnson, Reggie Torian, Sammy Fender and Nate Evans were among the replacements who joined Gooden and Cash. Inductees into both the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and the Vocal Group Hall of Fame, The Impressions are best known for their 1960s string of hits, many of which were heavily influenced by gospel music and served as inspirational anthems for the Civil Rights Movement. They are also 1998 Grammy Hall of Fame inductees for their hit \"People Get Ready\", and are winners of the Rhythm and Blues Foundation's Pioneer Award (in 2000) ."@en ;

Deep Purple keyboards player Don Airey made a guest appearance. According to the liner notes of the self-titled album, the project was instigated by Daisley who had discussed with Kerslake the possibility of \"re-doing some of the songs from the classic rock albums that they had co-written\". Six of those songs, \"I Don't Know\", \"Crazy Train\", \"Flying High Again\", \"Mr. Crowley\", \"Tonight\" and \"Over the Mountain\" originally appeared on the Ozzy Osbourne albums Blizzard of Ozz and Diary of a Madman. In 2002, Osbourne had re-issued both albums with Daisley and Kerslake's original performances replaced by new bass and drum tracks after both men had sued the singer for non-payment of royalties and related issues (despite playing on Diary of a Madman, Daisley and Kerslake's performances were credited to Rudy Sarzo and Tommy Aldridge for many years). In August, 2003, Daisley, Kerslake, Barnes and Morse recorded the album in Florida. Along with the Osbourne songs, the group also wrote five new tracks. Airey (who had also worked on the first two Osbourne albums and whose contributions were also uncredited) recorded his parts in London. Living Loud was released in 2004. While Morse and Airey were touring Australia with Deep Purple that year, Living Loud played two live shows, one at the Metro in Melbourne, and one at Fox Studios in Sydney. The latter event was recorded and released on DVD in 2005."@en ;

The band distinguished itself in the hardcore scene of the early 1980s through its jangly punk sound and sardonic humor delivered with thick Philadelphia accents. They attracted college radio attention with their 1985 debut album, Big Lizard in My Backyard, and the song \"Bitchin' Camaro\". Extensive touring and further releases helped the band garner an underground following. They enjoyed international success on the strength of \"Punk Rock Girl\", a single from their 1988 Beelzebubba album which entered into MTV rotation. After an ill-fated stint with the major label Hollywood Records, health problems and industry frustrations in the wake of their success led to the group's 1995 breakup. The group reunited in 2008, with Dan Stevens replacing the deceased Schulthise. In 2011, they released The King in Yellow, their first studio album in 16 years.

Petersen draws inspiration from the protest movements of the 1960s, \"the idea that rebellion in music didn't originate in punk rock\" (Profane Existence No. 54, 2007), and anti-establishment artists like Woody Guthrie and Crass. Petersen's lyrics often pay homage to American labor radicalism of the early 20th century. Mischief Brew has released albums and EPs on many different labels, notably Art of the Underground, Gunner Records, and Fistolo Records. In support of these records, Mischief Brew has toured extensively throughout the United States and Europe. When playing live, they have performed with four to five people, incorporating such instruments as junk/found percussion, trumpet, accordion, violin, mandolin, and vibraphone into their set."@en ;

The group initially consisted of Mikael Danielsson (guitar), Henrik Sunvisson (bass guitar) and Jimmy Olsson (vocals, drums). The name was inspired by a tongue-in-cheek version of The Stooges' song \"No Fun\" as covered by the Sex Pistols, and the name of the band Sick of It All. The group released their albums on the Swedish label Burning Heart Records outside the United States. Within the U.S., No Fun at All's albums were released by Theologian Records and later by Epitaph Records. In 1993, Jimmy Olsson left the band to concentrate on his other band Sober. No Fun at All then recruited three new members in Ingemar Jansson (vocals), Krister Johansson (guitar) and Kjell Ramstedt (drums). In 1999, Sunvisson left No Fun at All. Danielsson switched from guitar to bass guitar and Stefan Neuman, from Tribulation, took up the vacant guitar slot. On November 11, 2001, after ten years together and over 250,000 album sales worldwide, No Fun at All decided to quits. Since 2004, No Fun at All has performed some reunion gigs. At the reunion show at the Groezrock Festival, No Fun at All announced that they would bring out a new album in the fall of 2008 through their own label Beat 'Em Down Records. On April 19, 2012 the Millencolin Festival announced that No Fun At All canceled their show at the festival due to their disbandment . As of May 2013, however, the band is active again and will be touring Australia in November of that year with Boysetsfire, Off with Their Heads and Jughead's Revenge."@en ;

They also had two live guitarists, first Robin Jacobs (who later joined Razor Skyline) and then George Earth (most recently of Small Halo, also with Tina Root), and three live drummers, first Eric Gebow (now with Blue Man Group), Justin Clayton, and then Scott van Shoick. Switchblade Symphony's music combined orchestral sounds with heavy synth sequences and ethereal vocals to create a highly original sound resembling The Flower Duet sung over a twisted union of classical music and gothic rock. The band's name refers to this union, the result of cutting up elements of classical music to mix them with harder sounds. Though this sound is uncommon, it might be compared with Rhea's Obsession, Siouxsie, Cindergarden, The Machine in the Garden, The Birthday Massacre, and Dead Can Dance. Switchblade Symphony disbanded in November 1999. Subsequently, Tina Root started Tre Lux. In 2008, Tina Root and George Earth formed Small Halo, a band based out of Los Angeles and working on an upcoming EP. Their song \"Clown\" was featured in the 1998 film Wicked starring Julia Stiles."@en ;

They recruited drummer William A. 'W.A.S.' Sarginson and bassist Steve Maloney and were quickly signed up by Peaceville Records. Their debut album Awaken was recorded in early 1996 and released through Peaceville Records later that year. At the end of 1996 they toured throughout Europe with Cathedral and label mates, My Dying Bride. In the early summer of 1997 they recorded their second album, 'Mystica', and guitarist Paul Allender left the band to spend more time with his family (however he eventually rejoined Cradle of Filth). Mystica was released later that year, again through Peaceville Records. The album had less of a goth sound and more of a classic rock influenced progressive sound. The band continued and toured as a five piece, touring the UK with Orange Goblin supporting and then a short tour of Holland at the beginning of 1998. The band were looking to develop their sound and keyboard player Benjamin Ryan was told to leave the band in April 1998. However, this dismayed Paul Ryan, and shortly afterwards the band split up. In 2002, Peaceville released The Blood Divine compilation album Rise Pantheon Dreams. The tracklist included songs from both Awaken and Mystica, as well as two previously-unreleased tracks (\"Revolt\" and \"Forever Belongs\"), a live version of \"Aureole\", and a live cover of The Osmonds' \"Crazy Horses\". Allender later rejoined Cradle of Filth.

dbr:The_Music_Machine	rdf:type	dbo:Band ;
	dbo:abstract	"The Music Machine was an American garage rock band formed in Los Angeles, California in 1966. Fronted by chief songwriter and lead vocalist Sean Bonniwell, the band cultivated a characteristically dark and rebellious image reflected in an untamed musical approach. Sometimes it made use of distorted guitar lines and hallucinogenic organ parts, punctuated by Bonniwell's distinctively throaty vocals. Although they only briefly managed to attain national chart success with one single, the Music Machine is today considered by many critics to be a one of the groundbreaking acts of the 1960s. Their style is now recognized as a pioneering force in proto-punk; yet within a relatively short period of time, they began to employ more complex lyrical and instrumental arrangements that went beyond the typical garage band format. In 1965, the band came together as a folk rock trio known as the Raggamuffins, before expanding to the quintet that was later rechristened the Music Machine. The group was known for their style of dress, clothing themselves in all-black attire. In 1966, the Music Machine was signed to Original Sound, and released its first single \"Talk Talk\" in the latter half of the year, with it reaching the Top 20 of the Billboard Hot 100. Their debut album (Turn On) The Music Machine and the moderate hit \"The People In Me\" followed. The band's original lineup fragmented in late 1967 after managerial and financial disputes. Bonniwell reassembled the group under the name The Bonniwell Music Machine. In 1968, a second album, The Bonniwell Music Machine appeared, but the group disbanded in early 1969."@en ;

dbr:The_Rain	rdf:type	dbo:Band ;
	dbo:abstract	"The Rain were the Manchester band that eventually evolved into Oasis. The band formed in Manchester, England in 1991, taking their name from The Beatles' B-side, \"Rain\". Founding members were Paul \"Bonehead\" Arthurs (guitar), Paul \"Guigsy\" McGuigan (bass), Chris Hutton (vocals). Drummer Tony McCarroll joined shortly after the band formed to replace their drum machine and Hutton was replaced as vocalist by Liam Gallagher, who became the band's songwriter, in partnership with Arthurs. In this partnership, they wrote several songs including \"Take Me\" and \"Life in Vain\". The band rehearsed only one day a week and did not perform at shows often. Shortly after Liam joined, the band was renamed Oasis, at his suggestion. Various explanations of the origins of the name have been offered, however, it came about when Liam\u2019s older brother Noel roadied for the Inspiral Carpets at a venue in Swindon called the Oasis Leisure Centre. Liam reportedly liked the name's \"resonance of imagery.\" One day in August 1991, Noel, having recently returned from the Inspiral Carpets' tour of the U.S., went to watch his brother's band perform at the Manchester Boardwalk, supporting a band called Sweet Jesus. Noel offered to join, reportedly on condition that he would be the lead guitarist and they would perform only his songs. Noel made an instant impact on the band, he began to introduce new sounds and ways of creating music. After a few small warm up gigs in towns such as Middlesbrough, the band decided to produce Definitely Maybe, under the name of Oasis.[citation needed]"@en ;

In 1966, Mick Ronson joined The Rats, then including singer Benny Marshall, bassist Geoff Appleby, and drummer Jim Simpson (who was subsequently replaced by Clive Taylor and then John Cambridge). The group played the local circuit, and made a few unsuccessful trips to London and Paris. In 1967, The Rats recorded the one-off psychedelic track, \"The Rise and Fall of Bernie Gripplestone\" at Fairview Studios in Willerby, Hull, and can be heard on the 2008 release Front Room Masters \u2013 Fairview Studios 1966\u20131973. 1968 saw the band change their name briefly to Treacle and book another recording session at Fairview Studios in 1969, before reverting to their original name. Around this time, Ronson was recommended by Rick Kemp to play guitar on Michael Chapman's Fully Qualified Survivor album. In 1968, Keith 'Ched' Cheesman joined The Rats replacing Geoff Appleby on bass and the line up of Ronson, Marshall, Cheesman and Cambridge entered Fairview studio to record \"Guitar Boogie\", \"Stop and Get A Hold of Myself\" and \"Morning Dew\". When John Cambridge left The Rats to join his former Hullaballoos bandmate Mick Wayne in Junior's Eyes, he was replaced by Mick \"Woody\" Woodmansey. In November 1969, the band recorded a final session at Fairview, taping \"Telephone Blues\" and \"Early in Spring\". In May 1998, the independent record label, Angel Air released a CD compilation of their work, entitled The Rats' Rise and Fall of Bernie Gripplestone and the Rats From Hull."@en ;

As of 2014, the lineup consists of Phil Lewis (lead vocals, rhythm guitar), Steve Riley (drums, percussion, backing vocals), Kenny Kweens (bass guitar, backing vocals), and Michael Grant (lead guitar, backing vocals). The first incarnation of the group was formed by Tracii Guns in 1983, but disbanded in 1984 following its merger with fellow Los Angeles group Hollywood Rose, becoming the first lineup of Guns N' Roses. In 1985, the group was reformed by Guns and singer Paul Black adding Mick Cripps and Nickey Alexander. Black would soon be replaced by former Girl singer Phil Lewis while former Faster Pussycat bassist Kelly Nickels was added to the group. Later, Alexander would be replaced by former W.A.S.P. drummer Steve Riley with this being known as the \"classic lineup\" of L.A. Guns. They achieved moderate chart success in the late 1980s and early 1990s. However, the group went through numerous lineup changes (with Riley being the most consistent member) and failed to regain mainstream attention. The \"classic lineup\" of the group would reunite in 1999 and began recording new material. However, the group continued to change lineups and Guns eventually left to form the hard rock supergroup Brides of Destruction with Nikki Sixx of M\u00F6tley Cr\u00FCe in 2002. L.A. Guns continued without Guns, bringing in guitarist Stacey Blades, however, following his decision to put Brides of Destruction on hiatus in 2006, Guns formed The Tracii Guns Band. The group's lineup consisted of former L.A. Guns members Black, Alexander as well as Jeremy Guns (though the lineup would eventually change), with the group eventually changing their name to L.A. Guns. Both groups continued to record and tour under the L.A. Guns moniker until 2012, when the Tracii Guns led version of the group disbanded. To date, L.A. Guns has released ten studio albums \u2013 L.A.

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bickley_(band)>	rdf:type	dbo:Band ;
	dbo:abstract	"Bickley was a punk rock band from Houston, Texas from 1995 until 2001. The band's name is a word derived from Robert De Niro's character in Taxi Driver, Travis Bickle. Influenced primarily by the likes of The Vindictives, The Queers and Screeching Weasel, Bickley delivered a simple yet powerful sound. Bickley's first full-length studio recording was Pogo Au Go-Go (PaperDoll), a full-length CD issued in 1996. They quickly developed a loyal following in the Houston, Texas area. By 1998, Bickley had been picked up by Fearless Records, and the Pogo Au Go-Go CD was re-released under that label. In late 1998, Bickley released their second CD Kiss The Bunny, also on Fearless records. By this time their fan base extended across the US, and they often toured the Southwest US region, with short stints across the West Coast, East Coast, and the Deep South. Bickley's final release Fat, Drunk and Stupid captured their raucous live show at their favorite venue, Fitzgerald's, in Houston Texas. Fat, Drunk and Stupid was released in August 2001 through PaperDoll Records. Bickley were also noted by the music press for the adult content of their songs, and the unique character of lead singer Ben Fondled's voice. Bickley's core lineup (singer Ben Fondled, guitarist Uncle Dig, and drummer Dave Wreckoning) did not change from the time of their 1998 re-release under Fearless Records. Bickley switched between two bass players in the 1998-2001 period, driven by the availability of the players: Rubio Coconut (from the successful Houston punk rock band, 30 Foot Fall) and Bill Fool. On some instances where both Cisneros and Fool were present, Fool would switch to rhythm guitar while Cisneros played bass. Matte Finish was the original drummer for the band, and is the drummer on the Down the Hatch 7\", on Pogo Au Go-Go, and on some songs that appeared on Kiss the Bunny. In 2001, at the peak of their popularity, Bickley split up citing the need for more personal time with their respective families. The band has reunited at various times since August 2001 for special benefit and reunion shows. Bickley (including both Rubio Coconut on bass and Bill Fool on rhythm guitar) recently reunited for one night on July 20, 2013 at Fitzgerald's in Houston, TX for 30footFALL's 20th anniversary show. They re-released Down The Hatch on vinyl and released a greatest hits album entitled, \"Good To See You Again, Asshole!\", which includes 20 tracks of fan favorites from the band's two studio albums. Bickley will play another one off show with the 5 member lineup, again at Fitzgerald's. This show will be to celebrate their 20th anniversary, and will be supported by Dead To The World, O'Doyle Rules, and The Velostacks."@en ;

They were the first vegan straight edge band in Australia and appeared around the same time that Earth Crisis released Destroy the Machines. Ultimatum were one of the early Australian bands to introduce the modern 'new school' metal influenced form of hardcore to Australia. They were also recognised, not only for their vegan straight edge stance, but also for their emotional and politically charged lyrics. In 1995 upon release of their demo, Ultimatum raised the interest and ire of people within the small punk and hardcore scene in Australia with their expressedly militant lyrics and fanzine interviews. In late 1996, after some line-up changes, Ultimatum rechartered their direction, taking a more personal and broader political focus in their lyrics. They garnered a following around Australia and in Europe with the release of their first self-titled EP in 1997, recorded by engineer Scott Harper and mastered by Martin Pullan. Ultimatum's second split EP released on Melbourne based Trial and Error/Shock Records, with highly regarded and now defunct hardcore band Not for You was well received. This release promptly sold out and is now a rare item. During their time, Ultimatum performed with international bands H2O, Strife, Vision of Disorder, Sommerset and Australian bands 28 Days, Mindsnare, Vicious Circle and many others. Ultimatum disbanded in 2000.

Formed by Joe Pernice in 1996 after the breakup of his old band, the Scud Mountain Boys, and including Joe's brother Bob Pernice (hence the 'Pernice Brothers'), the band recorded their first album, Overcome by Happiness, for Sub Pop in 1998. After a 3-year hiatus (during which Joe Pernice recorded under his own name and as Chappaquiddick Skyline), Pernice Brothers returned in 2001 with The World Won't End; after parting with Sub Pop, the album was released on Pernice's own label, Ashmont Records, co-owned with his long-time manager Joyce Linehan, which in 2003 released Yours, Mine and Ours. After a 2004 tour, the band released their first live album in early 2005, Nobody's Watching/Nobody's Listening, and, in June of the same year, released their fourth studio album, Discover a Lovelier You. The band released Live a Little, their fifth studio album, in October 2006. Goodbye, Killer was released in June 2010. The band is currently at work on a new album, but no release date has been decided. The band's songs are characterized by lilting melodies and intelligent lyrics."@en ;

Weird War was initially formed as an umbrella organization in 2001 to encompass disparate anti-authoritarian groups and to \"challenge the idiocy of the new epoch.\" While the current lineup appears on the group's first release I'll Never Forget What's His Name, the group's first full length, self-titled release featured Neil Hagerty (of Royal Trux) and Jessica Espeleta (formerly of Love as Laughter) on guitars, and Steve McCarty (later of Dead Meadow) on drums. These collaborators soon left to pursue other programs, and the band became known as The Scene Creamers, with Ian Svenonius on vocals, Michelle Mae on bass, Alex Minoff (of Golden) on guitar, and Blake Brunner on drums. In this incarnation, the band released I Suck on that Emotion, through Drag City. After being threatened with a legal suit for the name Scene Creamers by a French graffiti artist collective of the same name, the band reverted to the name Weird War. Since then its membership has become static, with the addition of Argentine Sebastian Thomson (of the group Trans Am) on drums, and its intent has become more cosmic."@en ;

dbr:Bucks_Fizz	rdf:type	dbo:Band ;
	dbo:abstract	"Bucks Fizz is a British pop group which achieved success in the 1980s, most notably for winning the 1981 Eurovision Song Contest with the song \"Making Your Mind Up\". The group was formed in January 1981 specifically for the contest and comprised four vocalists: Bobby G, Cheryl Baker, Mike Nolan and Jay Aston. They achieved instant attention with the dance routine which accompanied the song, involving a skirt-rip. The group went on to have a successful career around the world (albeit ignored in the United States), while the UK remained their biggest market, where they had three No.1 singles with \"Making Your Mind Up\" (1981), \"The Land of Make Believe\" (1981) and \"My Camera Never Lies\" (1982) and became one of the top-selling groups of the 1980s. They also had UK Top 10 hits with \"Now Those Days Are Gone\" (1982), \"If You Can't Stand the Heat\" (1982), \"When We Were Young\" (1983) and \"New Beginning (Mamba Seyra)\" (1986). Their worldwide record sales have exceeded 15 million. The line-up of the group has changed a number of times over the years, most famously when Jay Aston quit the group in 1985 and was replaced by Shelley Preston. Today, two versions of the group exist; the official version which includes original member Bobby G and a three-member version who tour under the name Cheryl Baker, Mike Nolan and Jay Aston formerly of Bucks Fizz."@en ;

The group consisted of two siblings, Nazia Hassan and Zoheb Hassan (collectively known as Hassans or The Hassans or Hazan), who were a singing sensation and pop icons in Pakistan and South Asia. They are regarded as pioneers of the Pakistani pop music scene and were one of the most successful Pakistani groups, selling more than 60 million albums worldwide. The group initially gained prominence with their music single \"Aap Jaisa Koi\" first featured as a soundtrack for the 1980 Indian film Qurbani. The song was on the group's debut album Disco Deewane released in 1981 by Indian producer Biddu. The album was the best selling album of Asia at that time. It changed trends of music in Pakistan and was the first South Asian album that was also a hit in Brazil, Russia, South Africa and Indonesia. The duo released their second album Boom Boom in 1982 which was the soundtrack for the Bollywood movie Star. After two years the band recorded their critically acclaimed album Young Tarang in 1984. It was the first album of the subcontinent to feature music videos. Nazia and Zoheb released their fourth studio album, Hotline in 1987, which featured the duo's younger sister, Zahra Hassan. The group released their last studio album Camera Camera in 1992, which was also the first album produced by Zoheb. Before the release of their fifth studio album, Nazia and Zoheb announced that it would be their last album. It did not achieve the same success as the previous releases and only received average reaction. After the album's release, Nazia left her singing career to focus on her personal life. Zoheb went on to pursue his career as a solo artist and released his debut album Kismat in 2006. Nazia Hassan died from lung cancer in August 2000."@en ;

In contrast, the debut release features more third-wave qualities, and a sound that was very typical of 1995\u2014the year in which it was released. Officially, the band is known as B. Lee Band to avoid legal complications with the estate of the late Bruce Lee. In an interview, Park stated that after the first album had been released under the \"Bruce Lee Band\" name, Lee's brother Robert happened to work in the CD manufacturing plant responsible for pressing the album. Robert Lee contacted Park to give him a friendly word of caution that Mike should probably change the name. They were also briefly known as The Bruce Lee Hartney Band. Their new EP entitled Community Support Group was released January 28, 2014 on Really Records. The new EP introduces a new lineup that includes Jeff Rosenstock, Mike Huguenor, and Keven Higuchi."@en ;

dbr:Gwar	rdf:type	dbo:Band ;
	dbo:abstract	"Gwar, often styled as GWAR, is an American heavy metal band formed in Richmond, Virginia, United States, in 1984, composed of and operated by a frequently rotating line-up of musicians, artists and filmmakers collectively known as Slave Pit Inc. Easily identified by their distinctively grotesque costumes, Gwar's core thematic and visual concept revolves around an elaborate science fiction-themed mythology which portrays the band members as barbaric interplanetary warriors, a narrative which serves as the basis for all of the band's albums, videos, live shows and other media. Rife with over-the-top violent, sexual, and scatological humour typically incorporating social and political satire, Gwar have attracted both acclaim and controversy for their music and stage shows, the latter of which notoriously showcase enactments of graphic violence that result in the audience being sprayed with copious amounts of fake blood. Such stagecraft regularly leads Gwar to be labeled a \"shock rock\" band by the media. Since their formation, Gwar have released thirteen studio albums, two live albums, and numerous singles among other recordings, and have sold over 820,000 records in the United States. Fueled largely by the controversies surrounding their concerts, Gwar experienced brief mainstream notoriety during the first half of the 1990s, receiving regular airplay on MTV as well as frequent in-character guest appearances on daytime talk shows, satirizing the topics of censorship and media violence. Though the band's mainstream popularity declined by the end of the 1990s, Gwar has retained a dedicated cult following. The band's extensive videography consists of both live recordings and long-form feature films, most notably 1992's Phallus in Wonderland, which earned a Grammy Award nomination for Best Long Form Music Video. Outside of music and video, Gwar have expanded their franchise into a now-discontinued line of comic books, trading cards, a cartoon, a board game, signature beers, barbecue sauces, and e-liquids."@en ;

Social Distortion went on a temporary hiatus in the mid-1980s, due to frontman Ness' drug addiction and troubles with the law which resulted in extended stints in various rehabilitation centers that lasted for two years.

After 38 years of performing, Social Distortion continues to tour and record music. To date, Social Distortion has released seven full-length studio albums, two compilations, one live album, and two DVDs. They released two albums \u2014 Mommy's Little Monster (1983) and Prison Bound (1988) \u2014 before signing a three-album contract with Epic Records in 1989. Social Distortion rose to fame with their 1990 self-titled third album, which produced their well-known hit singles \"Ball and Chain\", \"Story of My Life\", and the cover of Johnny Cash's \"Ring of Fire\", and was certified gold by RIAA. Many of their later albums, including their second gold record Somewhere Between Heaven and Hell (1992), were also well received.

Musically, The Aquabats have continuously evolved over the course of their career, starting as an eight-member ska band before reinventing themselves in the early 2000s as a new wave-influenced rock quintet. The band's current musical style mixes rock and punk with elements of new wave, ska and synthpop. The Aquabats have released five studio albums, two extended plays and one compilation, among other recordings. From March 2012 to January 2014, the band also created and starred in The Aquabats!

David Reyne soon left and was replaced by Bill McDonough (drums, percussion). They were later joined by his brother Guy McDonough (vocals, rhythm guitar). The band was named after the front crawl swimming style also known as the Australian crawl. Australian Crawl were associated with surf music and sponsored a surfing competition in 1984. However, they also handled broader social issues such as shallow materialism, alcoholism, car accidents, and cautionary tales of romance. After their 1980 debut album, The Boys Light Up reached No. 4, Australian Crawl had two No. 1 albums; 1981's Sirocco and 1982's Sons of Beaches. Their early singles reached the top 25 but none broke into the Top Ten; their best performing single was No. 1 hit \"Reckless\" which showed a more mature approach than earlier hits, and came from their 1983 Semantics EP. Upheaval within the band occurred from 1983 onwards. First Bill McDonough left, then his brother Guy McDonough died in 1984, then various other members left. Their 1985 release Between a Rock and a Hard Place was expensive but sales were disappointing; and they disbanded early in 1986. The band's status as an icon on the Australian music scene was acknowledged by induction into the 1996 Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) Hall of Fame. Founding guitarist Brad Robinson was unable to attend the Hall of Fame induction in person, as he was hospitalised with lymphoma and died two weeks later."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Dru Hill is an American singing group, most popular during the late 1990s, whose repertoire included soul, hip hop soul and gospel music. Founded in Baltimore, Maryland, and active since 1992, Dru Hill recorded seven Top 40 hits, and is best known for the R&B #1 hits \"In My Bed\", \"Never Make a Promise\", and \"How Deep Is Your Love\". Tamir \"Nokio the N-Tity\" Ruffin was the group's founder; his groupmates included lead singer Mark \"Sisq\u00F3\" Andrews, Larry \"Jazz\" Anthony, and James \"Woody Rock\" Green. Signing to Island Records through Haqq Islam's University Records imprint, the group released two successful albums, Dru Hill and Enter the Dru, before separating for a period from late 1999 to 2002, during which time Sisq\u00F3 and Woody released solo albums. While Woody's Soul Music LP was a moderate success in the gospel music industry, Sisq\u00F3's debut album, Unleash the Dragon, and its hit single, \"Thong Song\", were major pop successes, and established Sisq\u00F3 as a household name outside of Dru Hill. Sisq\u00F3's second album, Return of Dragon, did not sell as well. In 2002, by then part of the Def Soul record label, the group reunited and added fifth member Rufus \"Scola\" Waller to the lineup for their third album, Dru World Order, whose underperformance led to the group being dropped from Def Soul. In 2009, the group signed to Kedar Entertainment Group and released their fourth album, InDRUpendence Day, the following year, with new member Tao taking the place of the again departed Woody."@en ;

They were often compared to Blondie and were influenced by Morrissey, who himself was a fan of the group. The most prominent part of Echobelly's success formula was vocalist Sonya Madan, who was also the group's primary lyricist. Born in Delhi, India, before moving to England at the age of two, Madan had an unusual background for a pop star. Her rigid upbringing made rock music taboo for her as a youngster, and she did not attend her first rock concert until she was in college. In 1990 she met Glenn Johansson, a guitarist from Sweden who was pursuing a career in music. Johansson had previously edited a Swedish pornographic magazine called Eros, which may have contributed to the band's focus on sexual issues in many of their songs. He and Madan dated for a while, then remained friends after breaking up."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Flipper's Guitar were a Tokyo-based rock band led by (and later a duo of) Keigo Oyamada and Kenji Ozawa. The band were influenced by the chirpy sound of British 80s pop groups like Haircut One Hundred, Exhibit B, The Style Council and Aztec Camera, as well as the fashionably eclectic sounds of early 90s Britain, from alternative dance to acid jazz. The sonic experimentation of Brian Wilson was also evident in some tracks. The group were an important part of the Tokyo Shibuya-kei scene in the late 1980s to early 1990s, and Oyamada went on to produce work for Pizzicato Five and his close friend Kahimi Karie. The band shows their influence on their sleeves, and their song titles often cited their British artists' influence \u2014 Goodbye Our Pastels Badges, Haircut One Hundred, The Colourfield. Following the demise of the band in 1991, the two members pursued solo careers. Ozawa released the album The Dogs Bark But The Caravan Moves On under his own name, and Oyamada recording under the name of Cornelius. It was as Cornelius that Oyamada gained a minor cult following outside Japan, as well as remix work for the likes of Blur, Beck, and the Manic Street Preachers."@en ;

dbr:The_Marvelettes	rdf:type	dbo:Band ;
	dbo:abstract	"The Marvelettes were an American all-girl group who achieved popularity in the early to mid-1960s. They consisted of schoolmates Gladys Horton, Katherine Anderson (now Schaffner), Georgeanna Tillman (later Gordon), Juanita Cowart (now Cowart Motley), and Georgia Dobbins, who was replaced by Wanda Young (now Rogers) prior to the group signing their first deal. They were the first major successful act of Motown Records after the Miracles and its first significantly successful girl group after the release of the 1961 number-one single, \"Please Mr. Postman\", one of the first number-one singles recorded by an all-female vocal group and the first by a Motown recording act. Founded in 1960 while the group's founding members performed together at their glee club at Inkster High School in Inkster, Michigan, they eventually were signed to Motown's Tamla label in 1961. Some of the group's early hits were written by band members and some of Motown's rising singer-songwriters such as Smokey Robinson and Marvin Gaye, who played drums on a majority of their early recordings. Despite their early successes, the group was eclipsed in popularity by groups like the Supremes, with whom they shared an intense rivalry. Nevertheless, they managed a major comeback in 1966 with \"Don't Mess with Bill\", followed by a few smaller hits. They struggled with issues of dismal promotion from Motown, illnesses, and mental breakdowns, with Cowart the first to leave in 1963, followed by Georgeanna Tillman two years later, and Gladys Horton two years later. The group ceased performing together in 1969 and, following the release of The Return of the Marvelettes in 1970, featuring only Wanda Rogers, disbanded for good, with both Rogers and Katherine Anderson leaving the music business. The group has received several honors including induction into the Vocal Group Hall of Fame, as well as receiving the Pioneer Award from the Rhythm and Blues Foundation. In 2005, two of the group's most successful recordings, \"Please Mr. Postman\" and \"Don't Mess with Bill\" earned million-selling Gold singles from the RIAA. On August 17, 2013, in Cleveland, Ohio, at Cleveland State University, the Marvelettes were inducted into the 1st class of the Official Rhythm & Blues Music Hall of Fame. The Marvelettes were nominated for induction to the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in 2013 and again in 2015."@en ;

The band makes use of both electronic and traditional instruments, and has sought to use electronics to recreate traditional indie rock song forms and instrumental structures. The group has released two albums on each of the American indie labels Teenbeat Records and Absolutely Kosher, and their track \"All I do\" was prominently featured in the soundtrack for the major film Wicker Park. The group has developed a devoted following in Japan and Taiwan, and has toured there frequently. Although many artists append bonus tracks onto the end of Japanese album releases to discourage purchasers from buying cheaper US import versions, the overseas versions of +/- albums are usually quite different from the US versions - tracklists can be rearranged, artwork with noticeable changes is used, and tracks from the US version can be replaced as well as augmented by bonus tracks."@en ;

[Here] \"US duo reveals there in three cuts its immoderate taste for a dancefloor minimal electro of a high quality, at once percussive, futuristic, heading and fresh.\" The group played a few live shows as four, but shortly thereafter parted ways.

	dbo:abstract	"Pointed Sticks are a Canadian punk rock / power pop band from Vancouver. Originally active from 1978 to 1981, then reuniting to perform in July 2006 through to November 2012. After a three year hiatus, Pointed Sticks returned to the stage in June 2015 for shows on Vancouver island as well as the July 11th Khatsahlano street party in Vancouver. They were the first Canadian band signed to Stiff Records, although the label was going through financial problems and never released an album by the band. The original band consisted of vocalist Nick Jones, guitarist Bill Napier-Hemy, bassist Tony Bardach and drummer Ian Tiles. Keyboard player Gord Nicholl joined soon after. Johnny Ferreira later joined on saxophone, Bardach was replaced by Scott Watson on bass, and Tiles was replaced by drummer Robert Bruce (from Active Dog), and later by Ken \"Dimwit\" Montgomery (who was also known for stints in the Subhumans and D.O.A.). The band released four singles, (including their only Stiff records release, a 3 song 7\") before releasing their first full-length album, Perfect Youth in 1980. Members of the band were featured in Dennis Hopper's 1980 film, Out of the Blue. The first compilation of their recordings was released in 1995 on Zulu Records. \"Part Of The Noise\", now out of print, included five songs from the \"Perfect Youth\" album as well as 45's and rarities. In 2005, the complete Perfect Youth album, with 4 bonus tracks, was reissued by Sudden Death Records, followed the next year by a compilation of singles, outtakes, and other rarities, entitled Waiting for the Real Thing also on Sudden Death. These two releases do not share or repeat any tracks. The original band members reunited in 2006 for a tour of Japan, and then continued to play sporadic concerts in Canada and the United States. In 2009 the band recorded an album of all new material,\"Three Lefts Make A Right\", released Nov.1 of that year on Northern Electric records. The band returned to Japan in August 2010 with support from a re-united \"Dishrags\", their all female contemporaries from the original Vancouver Punk scene. Pointed Sticks participated in a Vancouver benefit concert for Japan earthquake relief May 12, 2011. \"Three Lefts Make a Right\" was mixed by Vancouver's Mike Fraser. The complete \"Stiff Sessions\" recordings were released on CD in Japan in 2008, on the Base label. A third full length album simply titled \"Pointed Sticks\" is available (as of June 15, 2015) on the Northern Electric label via Sudden Death Distribution."@en ;

The Kill Devil Hills released their debut album Heathen Songs in August 2004 and nationally in February 2005 on Reverberation Records.

dbr:The_Malfated	rdf:type	dbo:Band ;
	dbo:abstract	"The Malfated are an independent guitar band from London, England, who gained a cult following using online websites such as MySpace. The band formed in 2004, and were one of the first UK bands to join MySpace in 2004. They use a drum machine, which they call 'Bel The Expendable Drum Machine'. Line ups have gone through various changes, Karl Steiger being the only constant. The current line up of The Malfated is Karl Steiger (vocals, bass, keyboards, percussion) and Robert Ackerman (all guitars, bass, keyboards). The Malfated's lyrics and music are predominantly written by frontman Karl Steiger, with occasional musical input from guitarist Natasha Spencer. Their sound draws from a large range of guitar genres - gothic rock, rock music, rock and roll, heavy metal, punk rock, indie rock, glam rock, deathrock, psychedelic rock, alternative metal, and pop - and their fanbase is largely made up of individuals from various alternative subcultures. The Malfated are part of a significant new breed of British bands using the Internet to reach out to people, rather than being dependent on television and printed mass media. Upon their arrival on MySpace, The Malfated regularly out-performed bigger bands such as Green Day in the MySpace charts, and continue to remain a mainstay. Although The Malfated have been approached by various independent labels, the band decided to go it alone, recording, pressing and distributing their own material which they then sold online. This meant that they retained complete control of the material they were able to record and release, as well as being able to release the sleeve artwork of their choosing. Their debut CD, 'Rat Candy', was released in June 2006 to immediate fanfare, and has currently sold in excess of five thousand copies, in an age when a big star on a big label need only sell three thousand singles to reach Number One in the UK Singles Chart. By the end of 2006, the band had already debuted five new songs from their forthcoming, and as-yet-untitled second album, on their MySpace profile."@en ;

The music has run a gamut from intense, all-acoustic free improvisation, to complex, modernistic rock composition; pure electronic noise to primitive punk-inspired jazz. The music defies idiomatic clich\u00E9 and is steadfastly abstract, choosing to work outside of pre-existing genres in order to attain an original fusion. Walter has been quoted as drawing inspiration from the fields of hardcore punk, black metal, progressive rock, free jazz, no wave, electronic noise, contemporary classical, Balinese gamelan and Noh music."@en ;

dbr:Michael_Nyman_Band	rdf:type	dbo:Band ;
	dbo:abstract	"The Michael Nyman Band, formerly known as the Campiello Band, is a group formed as a street band for a 1976 production of Carlo Goldoni's 1756 play, Il Campiello directed by Bill Bryden at the Old Vic. The band did not wish to break up after the production ended, so its director, Michael Nyman, began composing music for the group to perform, beginning with \"In Re Don Giovanni\", written in 1977. Originally made up of old instruments such as rebecs, sackbuts and shawms alongside more modern instruments like the banjo and saxophone to produce as loud a sound as possible without amplification, it later switched to a fully amplified line-up of string quartet, double bass, clarinet, three saxophones, horn, trumpet, bass trombone, bass guitar, and piano. This line up has been variously altered and augmented for some works. The band's first recorded album on a professional label was Nyman's second, the self-titled Michael Nyman (1981), which mostly comprised pieces written for the early films of Peter Greenaway. This album has yet to be released on compact disc. Another self-titled album (1995) has appeared as a promotional item compiling tracks from various other albums, and should not be confused with this one. Along with soundtracks to Greenaway's The Draughtsman's Contract, Drowning by Numbers, and The Cook The Thief His Wife & Her Lover, their 1980s output included The Kiss and Other Movements (which includes the titular art song; a song from Nyman's projected Tristram Shandy opera; a tango; a movement from the same work as \"Memorial\" as used in Greenaway's 26 Bathrooms; and a performance of music (not the original soundtrack) from Greenaway's Making a Splash) and the modern dance work And Do They Do. They also made a limited edition recording of Nyman's La Travers\u00E9e de Paris in 1989; many of its individual movements were soon to be dismantled, revised, or simply transplanted whole, to serve as the soundtrack for Greenaway's Prospero's Books (1991). Conversely, Nyman composed music for another adaptation of William Shakespeare's The Tempest, the ballet-opera Noises, Sounds & Sweet Airs, soon after Prospero's Books, some of which was dervied from La Travers\u00E9e de Paris. Their 1992 album, The Essential Michael Nyman Band, may appear to be a greatest hits compilation, but is actually composed of the concert versions of various film pieces, having undergone years of revisions and refinement, are significantly different from their soundtrack counterparts, to a far more severe extent than typical differences between classical music performances. This album also contains two cuts from the film score to A Zed & Two Noughts, which was originally performed by an orchestra of musicians who were never members of the band, with solos by band members Nyman, Balanescu, Perry, and Leonard. Similarly, The Piano was performed by members of the Munich Philharmonic Orchestra with Harle, Roach, Findon, and Nyman, but is also part of the band's repertoire. In 1993, the band joined with an orchestra for the first time in their recording history with MGV: Musique \u00E0 Grand Vitesse, a piece commissioned for the opening of a TGV line, first performed on 26 September 1993, in which the band, according to Nyman's own liner notes, represents the tracks, \"resisting the temptation of the concerto grosso\". The album credit is to \"The Michael Nyman Band and Orchestra\". The group has largely been superseded by the Michael Nyman Orchestra. Such soundtrack albums as Practical Magic, Ravenous, The End of the Affair, The Claim, and The Libertine are credited to this group, first implied on that 1994 album. While the former two titles lack detailed credits, the latter three albums show that most of the band (not to say most of those credited as full members over its history) performs in the Orchestra. The band's existence is far from over, however, as Nyman orchestrated his 2002 opera, Facing Goya, specifically for the band. His previous two opera recordings include band members but are not formally credited to the band, and one, the aforementioned Noises, Sounds & Sweet Airs, uses a full-scale orchestra, without Nyman at the baton. Man and Boy: Dada (2004) and Love Counts (2005; recorded 2007), Nyman's newest operas, feature the band conducted by Paul McGrath.. In 1996, another offshoot group, The Nyman Quartet, consisting of Cathy Thompson, Gabrielle Lester, Kate Musker, and Tony Hinnigan, recorded The Ballad of Kastriot Rexhepi (with Sarah Leonard--the only singer ever credited as a band member) and Exit No Exit, and plan to record the third recording of Nyman's four string quartets. They are produced by David Cunningham. Many of the current and former band members, including John Harle, Alexander Balanescu, Dave Lee, Madeleine Mitchell, Andrew Findon, and Simon Haram, have released solo albums that include performances of Nyman's music."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"The Dingoes is an Australian country rock band initially active from 1973 to 1979, formed in Melbourne which relocated to the United States from 1976. Most stable line-up was John Bois on bass guitar, John Lee on drums, Broderick Smith on vocals and harmonica, Chris Stockley on guitar, and Kerryn Tolhurst on guitar. Mal Logan (who provided keyboards the first LP) on keyboards joined after Stockley was hospitalised when shot in the stomach by Melbourne drug-dealer, Dennis Allen, who was attempting to gate crash a party. The Dingoes' debut single, \"Way Out West\", was released in November 1973, and peaked in the top 40 of the Australian Kent Music Report singles chart. Subsequent singles were \"Boy on the Run\", \"Smooth Sailing\", and \"Into the Night\", which did not reach the top 50. They had three top 40 albums, The Dingoes in 1974, Fives Times the Sun in 1977, and Orphans of the Storm in 1979. On 27 August 2009, The Dingoes were inducted into the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) Hall of Fame alongside Kev Carmody, Little Pattie, Mental As Anything, and John Paul Young. The Dingoes reformed in late 2009 and released a new album, Tracks in 2010 which was followed by a tour of Australia. A live album 'Live at Last' came out after the tour, which prompted another tour - this time without Bois who could not get away from his day job."@en ;

Since then, their three studio albums have obtained top 40 chartings and critical praise.

The group's name means \"dead hand\", based on a traditional Portuguese nursery rhyme. They are generally considered to be one of the most important bands in the Portuguese rock scene and have since reached a cult status. Since the start of their career, their live concerts became famous for their intensity and dark mood, due to their signature alternative rock sound and the performance of vocalist Adolfo Lux\u00FAria Canibal (a pseudonym, meaning Adolph Cannibal Lust), known for occasional onstage theatrics and his gravelly voice, half-sung, half-spoken singing style. M\u00E3o Morta's music is quite difficult to categorize as they seem to incorporate a variety of genres; from punk rock, metal, to industrial and experimental. Their sound, combined with Adolfo's lyrics, reflects urban violence, a human search for pleasure, freedom and a critique of contemporary consumerist society, often with sarcastic humour."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"The Sword is an American heavy metal band from Austin, Texas. Formed in 2003, the band is composed of vocalist and guitarist John D. Cronise, guitarist Kyle Shutt, bassist Bryan Richie, and drummer Santiago \"Jimmy\" Vela III. Originally signed to Kemado Records, the group released its debut album Age of Winters in 2006, the material for which had been largely written by Cronise. Follow-up album Gods of the Earth was released two years later and gave the group its first entry on the US Billboard 200 chart. In 2010 the band released Warp Riders, a concept album centered on an original science fiction narrative, which marked the first time the band had enlisted an external producer in Matt Bayles. Wingo left the group later in the year and was replaced briefly by Kevin Fender, before Vela joined in 2011. After signing with Razor & Tie in 2012 the group released its fourth album Apocryphon, which was promoted worldwide on the Apocryphon Tour. The band's fifth album, High Country, was released in 2015. The Sword is commonly categorized as a stoner metal or doom metal band, and is influenced by groups such as Black Sabbath and Sleep. The band has toured with a wide range of fellow metal artists, including ...And You Will Know Us by the Trail of Dead, Year Long Disaster, and Metallica on multiple occasions. The Sword's first album, Age of Winters, failed to chart, but subsequent releases have all gained increasing commercial success, with Apocryphon charting in the top 20 of the Billboard 200."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Whitecross is a Christian metal band that formed in 1985 in Waukegan, IL releasing their first recording in 1987. Their early albums, which often invite comparisons to Ratt, are laced with fast, technical guitar work. In 1994, Rex Carroll split with lead vocalist Scott Wenzel. Scott retained the use of the name \"Whitecross\" while Rex went on to form King James with Jimi Bennett (see below). At this point the band's sound underwent a drastic change. Whitecross has won three Dove Awards with Triumphant Return (in 1990) and In the Kingdom (in 1992) winning \"Metal Album of the Year\" and Come unto the Light from the Unveiled album winning \"Hard Music Recorded Song of the Year\" at the 25th GMA Dove Awards in 1994. In 1994 prior to work starting on the Unveiled album, guitarist Rex Carroll left to form the band King James and pursue other musical ventures. In 1998, singer Scott Wenzel took a two-year break to do mission work in Paraguay, South America. During this time, Whitecross went on hiatus before re-emerging at Cornerstone Festival in 2000 when Carroll and Wenzel re-formed the band with Rex, Scott, Michael Feighan and newcomer Benny Ramos providing bass, keyboards and vocals. Finally having achieved a long-sought lineup stability, the band started performing on a regular basis. In 2005, the band went back into the studio to record Nineteen Eighty Seven, which featured re-recordings of nine of the ten songs from the band's self-titled debut album (You're Mine being the exclusion), as well as a re-recording of the song Love on the Line (previously unavailable on CD) and a new guitar instrumental by Rex Carroll. On April 5, 2008, they played at the Legends of Rock festival in Ennepetal, Germany. Beginning in July 2008, they played the first of several short tours in Guatemala featuring shows in Guatemala City, Panajachel, Huehuetenango, among other cities.[citation needed] On March 12, 2011, Rex made post on his Facebook page announcing that he is \"working on some guitar tracks for new Whitecross songs\" which is likely to be for their new album."@en ;

dbr:Erste_Allgemeine_Verunsicherung	rdf:type	dbo:Band ;
	dbo:abstract	"The EAV (Erste Allgemeine Verunsicherung, German for \"First General Uncertainty/Uninsurance\") is an Austrian band that was formed in 1977. Nino Holm first established a band called \"Anti-Pasta\", but it was not successful and it dissolved after three years. Holm then decided together with his friend Thomas Spitzer to create a new band. While they were undecided on a name, they saw a bus stop in a branch of \"Erste Allgemeine Versicherung\" (\"First General Insurance\"), abbreviated EAV, and so they came to the name \"Erste Allgemeine Verunsicherung-EAV\". They initially faced legal difficulty in Austria due to the (obviously intended) similarity of their band name to that of the corporation \"Erste Allgemeine Versicherung\". This was later dropped and the insurance company was even known to sponsor them on a few occasions. The EAV often changed their members. Their members as of today are Klaus Eberhartinger (Vocals), Thomas Spitzer (Guitar, Vocals), Kurt Keinrath (Guitar, Keyboard, bass guitar), Franz Kreimer (Keyboard), Alvis Reid (Bass guitar) and Aaron Thier (Drums). The band is known for open statements against political extremism especially on the right (\"bacillus nationalis\") and was sued by prominent politicians of the political right like Kurt Waldheim for drawing attention to his past in the 3rd Reich and J\u00F6rg Haider then head of the right-leaning FP\u00D6. Songs on this topic include e.g. \"Eierkopf-Rudi\" or \"Wir marschieren\". Their songs are mostly jovial in nature, but the lyrics contain hints of social criticism as well. For example, \"Cinderella\" (1994) is one of their \"fun\" songs, in which they tell the tale of Cinderella in a funny way: \"Sie schlief im Kohlenkeller, trotzdem war sie bettelarm, weil sie von der vielen Kohle, die da lag, zu wenig nahm\" (\"She slept in the coal cellar, but she was dirt-poor, because she didn't take much of the plentiful coal that lay there\"). The word \"Kohle\" (\"coal\") is a colloquial word for money in German. The stage shows are known for lavishness in both backdrop and costumes, the latter often selected and changed for specific songs that are then acted out by either the vocalist or other members. Despite the band's failed attempt to gain international fame, they still remain quite popular in Germany and Austria."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Indian Ocean is an Indian rock band formed in New Delhi in 1990, who are widely recognized as the pioneers of the fusion rock genre in India. Susmit Sen, Asheem Chakravarty, Rahul Ram and Amit Kilam were band members till Chakravarty's death on 25 December 2009, after which Tuheen Chakravorty and Himanshu Joshi were officially inducted into the band as replacements. After the departure of Susmit Sen in 2013, Rahul Ram is the only founding member who appeared on the band's debut album Indian Ocean. The musical style of the band can be at best classified as fusion music. It is an experimental genre, fusing raga (traditional Indian tunes) with rock music, guitars and drums, sometimes using Indian folk songs. It has also been described by some music critics as \"Indo-rock fusion with jazz-spiced rhythms that integrates shlokas, sufism, environmentalism, mythology and revolution\". Since 2010, the band has moved against the lines of record labels. They released their latest album 16/330 Khajoor Road online for free. The main reason for this move was the frustration over negotiating contracts with record companies and fighting over copyright issues. They have turned to concerts and sponsorships for generating revenue rather than playing in the hands of record labels. For a brief amount of time they had the sponsorship of Johnnie Walker. They are also a part of the world's first Music Personalisation Initiative named DRP as one of the five Featured Artists. In its 2014 listing of \"25 Greatest Indian Rock Songs of the last 25 Years\", \"Rolling Stone India\" featured two songs, Ma Rewa and Kandisa from the album, Kandisa (2000)."@en ;

The band completed a comeback UK tour in June 2007, and continued touring throughout 2008 and 2009. New material was recorded in 2009 and played live, but has yet to be released."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"The Silencers are a Scottish rock band formed in London in 1986 by Jimme O'Neill and Cha Burns, two ex-members of the post-punk outfit Fingerprintz. Their music is characterised by a melodic blend of pop, folk and traditional Celtic influences. Often compared to Scottish bands with a similar sound like Big Country, Del Amitri and The Proclaimers, The Silencers have distinguished themselves with their eclectic sounds, prolific output and continued career. Their first single, \"Painted Moon,\" was a minor international hit and invited critical comparisons to Simple Minds and U2. In 1987 they released their first album A Letter From St. Paul, which included \"Painted Moon\" and another minor hit, \"I See Red.\" Buoyed by the huge European hit \"Bulletproof Heart\", the band's third album Dance to the Holy Man is the band's commercial peak to date. Throughout the 1990s, The Silencers saw a popular taste shift away from their songwriter-based style of music toward grunge and electronic music."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Wolfmother are an Australian hard rock band from Sydney, New South Wales. Formed in 2000 by vocalist and guitarist Andrew Stockdale, bassist and keyboardist Chris Ross, and drummer Myles Heskett, the group currently includes Stockdale, bassist and keyboardist Ian Peres, and touring drummer Alex Carapetis. Wolfmother released their self-titled debut album Wolfmother in Australia in 2005, and internationally in 2006, which has since sold over 1.5 million copies worldwide and won the band a number of industry awards. Ross and Heskett left the band in 2008. Stockdale returned with a new lineup featuring Peres, rhythm guitarist Aidan Nemeth and drummer Dave Atkins in 2009, releasing Cosmic Egg later in the year. After more personnel changes, the group's planned third album was released in 2013 as Keep Moving, a Stockdale solo album. Later that year, Wolfmother returned as a trio featuring Peres and drummer Vin Steele for 2014's New Crown. The band's fourth album Victorious was released in February 2016. Wolfmother have been categorised by various commentators within the genres of hard rock, heavy metal, stoner rock and psychedelic rock. They are often compared to influential classic rock and metal bands from the 1960s and 1970s, including Led Zeppelin, Black Sabbath, Blue Cheer and AC/DC. Frontman Stockdale has typically led songwriting for the group, although the material on the band's debut album was co-credited to Ross and Heskett. Stockdale also produced the group's third album New Crown."@en ;

Despite favourable reviews and a short-listing for the Mercury Prize, their 2000 d\u00E9but studio album Felt Mountain did not chart highly. Goldfrapp's second album Black Cherry, which incorporated glam rock and synthpop sounds into their music, was released in 2003. The album influenced the same dance-oriented sound of their third album Supernature. Supernature took Goldfrapp's work further into dance music, and enjoyed international chart success. The album produced three number-one US dance singles, and was nominated for Best Electronic/Dance Album at the 49th Grammy Awards. Their fourth album Seventh Tree placed a greater emphasis on ambient and downtempo music, drawing inspiration from nature and paganism, while their fifth album, Head First, found the group exploring 1980s-influenced synthpop. Head First also earned the duo their second Grammy Award nomination for Best Electronic/Dance Album in 2010. Goldfrapp released their critically acclaimed sixth studio album, the Folktronica influenced Tales of Us, in September 2013."@en ;

In 1989, after Hunter and Berdon left to pursue other projects, the band was rebranded with the addition of Judd Austin and Trey Sabatelli as \"The Gone Jackals\", releasing their first album Out and About with the Gone Jackals in 1990. The band's music generally consisted of hard, garage and blues rock. Their next album, Bone to Pick (1995) also incorporated heavy metal. The band collaborated with Peter McConnell of LucasArts to produce the soundtrack to the biker-themed adventure game Full Throttle; tracks from Bone to Pick were specifically adapted for this purpose. Blue Pyramid (1998), their third and final album, also included experimentation with psychedelic rock. The band broke up in 1999, though not before signing up a new label for distributing their music in Europe. In late 2001, Karloff started working on a new musical project. Led by his passion for the old style rock music, he formed the Bonedrivers, a blues rock power trio which has since then toured the United States and published a locally acclaimed debut album named Roadhouse Manifesto, an even bigger second outing titled Mobile, and a third one titled Greasefire."@en ;

In the following years, they recorded their \"Brown Bag\" demo, and went out on a few small tours. After a few volatile years which saw several collective moves and incarnations, the group solidified its line-up and relocated to New York City. The current line-up includes Michelle Proffit (vocals), Dave Sanders (guitar, backing vocals), Derek Wimble (bass), and Justin Williams (drums). The band performs a form of hardcore punk, incorporating melodic indie rock style riffs, often in 6/8 time. Michelle Proffit's vocal style consists mostly of screaming and screeching the lyrics. The lyrics lean towards the left-wing side of the political scale. The band recorded its first EP in early 2002 with producer Don Fury. The result, Invasive/Exotic, was released on G7 Welcoming Committee Records in May, 2002. After touring a bit for the record, the band split up that same year. The members were convinced to re-form in late 2003 by the people at G7 Records. Newly reformed with the same lineup, the band began working on songs that would eventually be recorded and released their first full-length album, End States (2005), again on G7 Welcoming Committee Records."@en ;

dbr:Rage_Against_the_Machine	rdf:type	dbo:Band ;
	dbo:abstract	"Rage Against the Machine (also known as RATM or just Rage) is an American political rap metal band from Los Angeles, California. Formed in 1991, the group consists of rapper and vocalist Zack de la Rocha, bassist and backing vocalist Tim Commerford, guitarist Tom Morello and drummer Brad Wilk. They draw inspiration from early heavy metal instrumentation, as well as hip hop acts such as Afrika Bambaataa, Public Enemy, the Beastie Boys and Dutch crossover band Urban Dance Squad. Rage Against the Machine is well known for the members' leftist and revolutionary political views, which are expressed in many of the band's songs. As of 2010, they have sold over 16 million records worldwide. In 1992, the band released its self-titled debut album, which became a commercial and critical success, leading to a slot in the 1993 Lollapalooza festival. In 2003, the album was ranked number 368 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time. The band did not release a follow-up record until 1996, with Evil Empire. The band's third album, The Battle of Los Angeles, followed in 1999, and in 2003, the album was ranked number 426 on the same list. During their initial nine-year run, they became one of the most popular and influential bands in music history, according to music journalist Colin Devenish. They were also ranked No. 33 on VH1's 100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock. The band had a large influence on the nu metal genre which came to prominence during the second half of the 1990s. In 2000, the band released the cover album, Renegades. The same year, growing tensions over the direction of the band prompted de la Rocha to quit, leading to the band's breakup. De la Rocha started a low-key solo career, while the rest of the band formed the rock supergroup Audioslave with Chris Cornell, then-former frontman of Soundgarden; Audioslave recorded three albums before disbanding in 2007. The same year, Rage Against the Machine announced a reunion and performed together for the first time in seven years at the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival in April 2007. Up until 2011, the band continued to perform at more live venues and festivals around the world. As of 2016, the group has no plans to perform or release new music."@en ;

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Scorpions_(band)>	rdf:type	dbo:Band ;
	dbo:abstract	"Scorpions are a German rock band formed in 1965 in Hanover by Rudolf Schenker. Since the band's inception, its musical style has ranged from hard rock to heavy metal. The lineup from 1978\u201392 was the most successful incarnation of the group, and included Klaus Meine (vocals), Rudolf Schenker (rhythm guitar), Matthias Jabs (lead guitar), Francis Buchholz (bass guitar), and Herman Rarebell (drums). The band's only constant member is Rudolf Schenker, although Meine has been the lead singer for all of the band's studio albums, and Jabs has been a consistent member since 1979. During the mid-1970s, with guitarist Uli Jon Roth part of the line-up, the music of Scorpions was defined as hard rock. After the departure of Roth in 1978, Matthias Jabs joined and, following the guidance of producer Dieter Dierks, Scorpions changed their sound towards melodic heavy metal, mixed with rock power ballads. Throughout the 1980s the group received positive reviews and critical acclaim from music critics, and experienced commercial success with the albums Animal Magnetism (1980), Blackout (1982), Love at First Sting (1984), World Wide Live (1985) and Savage Amusement (1988). Their best-selling album Crazy World (1990) includes the song \"Wind of Change\", a symbolic anthem of the political changes in Eastern Europe in the late 1980s and early 1990s and the fall of the Berlin Wall. It is one of the best-selling singles in the world with over fourteen million copies sold. Scorpions have sold over 100 million records in total. They have released 18 studio albums, 27 compilation albums and 74 singles. Six of their singles have reached number one on the charts in different countries. Their albums, singles, compilations and video releases have reached 200 times gold, platinum and multi-platinum status in different countries. Rolling Stone magazine describes Scorpions as \"the heroes of heavy metal\", and MTV called them \"Ambassadors of Rock\". The band was ranked number 46 on VH1's Greatest Artists of Hard Rock programme, with \"Rock You Like a Hurricane\" at number 18 on VH1's list of the 100 Greatest Hard Rock Songs. \"Still Loving You\" ranked 22nd place among the greatest ballads. Scorpions have received prestigious awards such as three World Music Awards, a star on the Hollywood Rock wall, and a presence in the permanent exhibition of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. In 2015 the group celebrated its 50th anniversary."@en ;

dbr:The_Magnetic_Fields	rdf:type	dbo:Band ;
	dbo:abstract	"The Magnetic Fields (named after the Andr\u00E9 Breton/Philippe Soupault novel Les Champs Magn\u00E9tiques) is an American indie pop group founded and led by Stephin Merritt. He is the group's primary songwriter, producer and vocalist, as well as frequent multi-instrumentalist. The Magnetic Fields is essentially a vehicle for Merritt's songwriting, as are various side-projects, such as The 6ths, Future Bible Heroes and The Gothic Archies. While the musical style of the band is as malleable as Merritt's songwriting, its songs are commonly attributed to pop genres such as synthpop, indie pop, and noise pop. The band is often cited[citation needed] as being recognizable by Merritt's lyrics, often about love and often with irregular or neutral gender roles, that are by turns ironic, tongue-in-cheek, bitter, and humorous. The band released their debut single \"100,000 Fireflies\" in 1991, which was typical of the band's earlier career characterized by synthesized instrumentation by Merritt with lead vocals provided by Susan Anway (and then by Stephin Merritt himself from The House of Tomorrow EP onwards). A more traditional band later materialized, currently composed of Merritt, Claudia Gonson, Sam Davol, and John Woo, with occasional guest vocals by Shirley Simms. Their best-known work is the 1999 three-volume concept album 69 Love Songs. It was followed in the succeeding years by a \"no-synth\" trilogy: i (2004), Distortion (2008), and Realism (2010). The band's most recent album, Love at the Bottom of the Sea, was released in 2012."@en ;

dbr:Wilco	rdf:type	dbo:Band ;
	dbo:abstract	"Wilco is an American alternative rock band based in Chicago, Illinois. The band was formed in 1994 by the remaining members of alternative country group Uncle Tupelo following singer Jay Farrar's departure. Wilco's lineup changed frequently during its first decade, with only singer Jeff Tweedy and bassist John Stirratt remaining from the original incarnation. Since early 2004, the lineup has been unchanged, consisting of Tweedy, Stirratt, guitarist Nels Cline, multi-instrumentalist Pat Sansone, keyboard player Mikael Jorgensen, and drummer Glenn Kotche. Wilco has released nine studio albums, a live double album, and four collaborations: three with Billy Bragg and one with The Minus 5. Wilco's music has been inspired by a wide variety of artists and styles, including Bill Fay, The Beatles and Television, and has in turn influenced music by a number of modern alternative rock acts. The band continued in the alternative country of Uncle Tupelo on its debut album A.M. (1995), but has since introduced more experimental aspects to their music, including elements of alternative rock and classic pop. Wilco's musical style has evolved from a 1990s country rock sound to a current \"eclectic indie rock collective that touches on many eras and genres.\" Wilco garnered media attention for their fourth album, Yankee Hotel Foxtrot (2002), and the controversy surrounding it. After the recording sessions were complete, Reprise Records rejected the album and dismissed Wilco from the label. As part of a buy-out deal, Reprise gave Wilco the rights to the album for free. After streaming Foxtrot on its website, Wilco sold the album to Nonesuch Records in 2002. Both record labels are subsidiaries of Warner Music Group, leading one critic to say the album showed \"how screwed up the music business is in the early twenty-first century.\" Yankee Hotel Foxtrot is Wilco's most successful release to date, selling over 670,000 copies. Wilco won two Grammy Awards for their fifth studio album, 2004's A Ghost Is Born, including Best Alternative Music Album. Wilco's most recent studio album, Star Wars, was released on July 16, 2015."@en ;

Originally active between 1997 and 2002, they enjoyed success in both Europe and North America between 1998 and 2000, releasing two albums and eight singles, all of which made the UK Top 20. Their first four singles, \"C'est la Vie\", \"Rollercoaster\", \"To You I Belong\" and \"Blame It on the Weatherman\", all reached number one in the UK Singles Chart. In 2002, having sold over 3 million albums worldwide, B*Witched were dropped by their record company. Soon afterwards, when O'Carroll decided to leave, the group split up. In 2006, the Lynch sisters formed a group, Ms. Lynch, frequently performing B*Witched material at live shows. On 18 October 2012, it was announced that B*Witched would reunite for the ITV2 reality-documentary series The Big Reunion, along with other pop groups of their time, including Liberty X, Five and Atomic Kitten. The show follows the six groups as they reunited for the first time in a decade and rehearsed ahead of a comeback performance at the Hammersmith Apollo on 26 February 2013. Due to the success of the show and the high demand for tickets at the Hammersmith Apollo gig, the Big Reunion lineups also embarked on an arena tour around the UK and Ireland. In May 2013, B*Witched unveiled a new song called \"Love and Money\". During a radio interview in October 2013, Edele Lynch confirmed that the group would be releasing new material in September 2014.

Their success on both pop and dance charts have earned the group a listing in The Guinness Book of World Records as the all-female group with the most chart entries in the world, a record which they still hold. They released their debut single \"Aie a Mwana\" in 1981. The group's 10 UK Top 10 hits include \"It Ain't What You Do...\" (1982), \"Really Saying Something\" (1982), \"Shy Boy\" (1982), \"Na Na Hey Hey Kiss Him Goodbye\" (1983), \"Cruel Summer\" (1983), \"Robert De Niro's Waiting...\" (1984) and \"Love in the First Degree\" (1987). In 1986, they had a US number one with another of their UK Top 10 hits, \"Venus\". In total, they had 11 singles reach the US Billboard Hot 100 (1983-1988), including two more in the top 10, with \"Cruel Summer\" (1984) and \"I Heard a Rumour\" (1987). They are associated with the MTV-driven Second British Invasion of the US. In 1988, \"Love in the First Degree\" earned them a Brit Award nomination for Best British Single, while their fourth album Wow! (1987), topped the Australian ARIA albums chart. Following Fahey's departure from the group in 1988, Jacquie O'Sullivan joined the group for three years and they had UK Top 10 hits with \"I Want You Back\" (1988) and \"Help!\" (1989). In addition to their chart success, the band is also known for their vocal style, generally singing in unison rather than in harmony like most vocal groups. Since 1992, Woodward and Dallin have continued Bananarama as a duo, with hits including \"Movin' On\" (1992) and \"More, More, More\" (1993). They returned to the UK Top 20 for the first time since 1991 with the 2005 single \"Move in My Direction\". Between 1982 and 2009, they had 28 singles reach the Top 50 of the UK singles chart."@en ;

Formed in 1983, Bon Jovi consists of lead singer and namesake Jon Bon Jovi (born John Francis Bongiovi, Jr.), pianist and keyboard player David Bryan, and drummer Tico Torres. The band's lineup has remained mostly static during its history, with the only exceptions being the 1994 dismissal of bass player Alec John Such, who was unofficially replaced by Hugh McDonald, and the departure of longtime guitarist and co-songwriter Richie Sambora in 2013. In 1986, Bon Jovi achieved widespread global recognition with their third album, Slippery When Wet. The band's fourth album, New Jersey was equally successful in 1988. After touring and recording non-stop during the late 1980s, the band went on hiatus following the New Jersey Tour in 1990, during which time Jon Bon Jovi and Richie Sambora both released successful solo albums. In 1992, the band returned with the album Keep the Faith. Their 2000 single \"It's My Life\", which followed a second hiatus, successfully introduced the band to a younger audience. Bon Jovi have been known to use different styles in their music, which has included country for their 2007 album Lost Highway. On March 12, 2013, Bon Jovi released their 12th studio album, What About Now. Thus far, Bon Jovi has released 13 studio albums, plus two compilations and two live albums.

Cake was formed in 1991 by McCrea, DiFiore, Greg Brown, Frank French and Sean McFessel, who soon left and was replaced by Nelson. Following the self-release of its debut album, Motorcade of Generosity, the band was signed to Capricorn Records in 1995 and released its first single, \"Rock 'n' Roll Lifestyle\", which hit number 35 on the Modern Rock Tracks music chart and was featured on MTV's 120 Minutes; French and Nelson then left the band, and were replaced by Todd Roper and Victor Damiani. Cake's second album, 1996's Fashion Nugget, went platinum on the strength of its lead single, \"The Distance\". Following a tour of Europe and the United States, both Brown and Damiani announced they were leaving Cake, which led to speculation about the band's future; McCrea eventually recruited Xan McCurdy to take over on guitar, and persuaded Nelson to return. Prolonging the Magic, the band's third album, was released in 1998 and went platinum, having shipped over one million units; this was followed three years later by Comfort Eagle, the band's first album on Columbia Records, featuring the single \"Short Skirt/Long Jacket\" which hit number 7 on the Modern Rock Tracks chart. Following a series of tours, including several versions of the Unlimited Sunshine Tour, the band released Pressure Chief in 2004, its second and last album on Columbia. After creating its own label, Upbeat Records, the band released Showroom of Compassion in 2011, which became its first album to debut at the top of the Billboard charts, selling 44,000 copies in the first week after release."@en ;

In 1994, the band recorded \"Harder to Believe than Not To\" for I Predict A Clone, a tribute album to Steve Taylor. The following year, the couple released their first album, Delusions of Grandeur on Universal Records. Ben Folds, who called Fleming and John the \"The Carpenters of the 1990s with Led Zeppelin's rhythm section\", invited them to open for his band. They performed and recorded with Folds for many years. In 1999, Fleming and John released their second album, The Way We Are, which spawned a minor hit with the single \"Ugly Girl\". The duo has recorded many cover songs, including \"Winter Wonderland\" (to the tune of Led Zeppelin's \"Misty Mountain Hop\"), \"Eldorado\" (Electric Light Orchestra), \"California Dreamin'\" (the Mamas & the Papas), \"Somebody to Love\" (Jefferson Airplane), \"After the Lovin'\" (Engelbert Humperdinck). A longtime concert favorite has been Sonny & Cher's \"I Got You Babe\" to the tune of Zeppelin's \"Black Dog\". The band has been dormant since the tour for The Way We Are finished in the late 1990s.

dbr:Kreator	rdf:type	dbo:Band ;
	dbo:abstract	"Kreator is a German thrash metal band from Essen. Their style of music is similar to that of their compatriots Destruction, Sodom and Tankard; along with those three bands, Kreator has been referred to as one of the \"big four\" of Teutonic thrash metal, and they are often credited with helping pioneer death metal and black metal by containing several elements of what was to become those genres. They originally performed a speed metal style with Venom influences. Kreator's work began in the vein of thrash metal but ventured into industrial metal and gothic metal from 1992 to 1999, before eventually returning to their classic thrash sound to date. The band has achieved worldwide sales of over two million units for combined sales of all their albums, making them one of the best-selling German thrash metal bands of all time. To date, Kreator has released thirteen studio albums, two EPs, one live album and three compilation albums. They gained a large underground fanbase in the international thrash metal community, and were one of the first German thrash metal bands to sign to a major label (Epic Records in 1988). However, Kreator would not have success until later albums, including their thirteenth studio album Phantom Antichrist (2012), which peaked at higher chart positions in many countries. The band has been working on a new album, which is due for release around 2017."@en ;

dbr:Lost_Dogs	rdf:type	dbo:Band ;
	dbo:abstract	"Lost Dogs are an American musical supergroup formed in 1991, comprising vocalists, songwriters, and guitarists from multiple Christian alternative rock bands. Their current lineup includes Terry Scott Taylor (Daniel Amos, the Swirling Eddies), Michael Roe (The 77s), Derri Daugherty and Steve Hindalong (The Choir). The original lineup included Gene Eugene (Adam Again), who died in 2000. The band's eclectic blending of folk, blues, country, and rock has been characterized as \"a sort of CCM equivalent to the Traveling Wilburys\". The band released their debut album Scenic Routes in 1992 as a one-time collaboration. Lost Dogs concert performances are filled with between-song jokes and one-liners between the band members (usually poking fun at each other). Many Lost Dogs albums include at least one or two cover songs. Songs covered by Lost Dogs on an album or in concert include Bob Dylan's \"Lord Protect My Child\", Leonard Cohen's \"If It Be Your Will\", The Beatles' \"I'm A Loser\", \"The Chipmunk Song (Christmas Don't Be Late)\", and Stephen Foster's \"Hard Times, Come Again No More\". In March, 2000, shortly after the release of their Gift Horse album, Gene Eugene died. In 2004, the band got together with Steve Hindalong to produce a special album for their summer tour. The result was entitled MUTT, and included new acoustic versions of ten songs originally written and recorded for each band member's regular rock bands. The following year, the band would release the almost entirely instrumental Island Dreams. The Lost Cabin and the Mystery Trees, was released July 2006. In 2008, the Lost Dogs traveled down historic Route 66 with cinematographer Jimmy Abegg. Abegg filmed the band's experiences. The band then wrote and recorded 14 songs inspired by their journey, which was released as Old Angel in May 2010."@en ;

dbr:Nightwish	rdf:type	dbo:Band ;
	dbo:abstract	"Nightwish is a symphonic metal band from Kitee, Finland. The band was formed in 1996 by lead songwriter and keyboardist Tuomas Holopainen, guitarist Emppu Vuorinen, and lead singer Tarja Turunen. The band soon picked up drummer Jukka Nevalainen, and then bassist Sami V\u00E4nsk\u00E4 after the release of their debut album, Angels Fall First (1997). In 2002, V\u00E4nsk\u00E4 was replaced by Marco Hietala, who also took over the male vocalist role previously filled by Holopainen or guest singers. Although Nightwish have been prominent in their home country since Angels Fall First, they did not achieve worldwide fame until the release of the albums Oceanborn (1998), Wishmaster (2000) and Century Child (2002). Their 2004 album, Once, has sold more than one million copies and was the band's breakthrough in the United States. Their biggest US hit single, \"Wish I Had an Angel\" (2004), received MTV airplay and was included on three US film soundtracks to promote their North American tour. The band produced three more singles and two music videos for Once, as well as a re-recording of \"Sleeping Sun\" for the \"best of\" compilation album, Highest Hopes (2005), before Turunen's dismissal in October 2005. Her last performance with Nightwish was during a concert recorded for the live album/DVD End of an Era. After the concert, the other members informed Turunen with an open letter that she was no longer a member of Nightwish. In May 2007, Nightwish announced Anette Olzon as Turunen's replacement. That September, the band released their sixth album, Dark Passion Play, which has sold almost 2 million copies. The album's lead single, \"Amaranth\", became one of Nightwish's most successful in Europe. The supporting tour, one of the band's largest, started on October 6, 2007 and ended on September 19, 2009. The band released an EP/live album, Made in Hong Kong (And in Various Other Places), in March 2009 as a CD/DVD, and their seventh studio album, Imaginaerum, was released globally on various days in late 2011/early 2012. On October 1, 2012, Nightwish announced that they had parted ways with Olzon and would be finishing the current tour with ReVamp and former After Forever vocalist Floor Jansen. In October 2013, Nightwish made Jansen and longtime session uillean pipes player Troy Donockley permanent members of the band, and they were featured in the acclaimed album Endless Forms Most Beautiful, released in March, 2015. Nightwish is the third-best-selling band and musical entity in Finland with certified sales of nearly 900,000 certified copies. The group is also the most successful Finnish band worldwide, selling more than 8 million records and receiving more than 60 gold and platinum awards, having released five Number 1 albums and thirteen Number 1 singles."@en ;

dbr:Nine_Inch_Nails	rdf:type	dbo:Band ;
	dbo:abstract	"Nine Inch Nails (abbreviated NIN; stylized as NI\u0418) is an American industrial rock band, founded in 1988 by Trent Reznor in Cleveland, Ohio. As its main producer, singer, songwriter, and instrumentalist, Reznor is the only official member of the group and remains solely responsible for its direction. Nine Inch Nails' music straddles a wide range of genres. After recording a new album, Reznor usually assembles a live band to perform with him. The touring band features a revolving lineup that often rearranges songs to fit a live setting. On stage, Nine Inch Nails often employs visual elements to accompany performances, which frequently include light shows. Underground music audiences warmly received Nine Inch Nails in its early years. Reznor produced several highly influential records in the 1990s that achieved widespread popularity: many Nine Inch Nails songs became radio hits; and their entire catalog has reached record sales exceeding over 20 million albums worldwide, with 10 million sales certified in the United States alone. In 1997, Reznor appeared in Time magazine's list of the year's most influential people, and Spin magazine described him as \"the most vital artist in music.\"In 2004, Rolling Stone placed Nine Inch Nails at 94 on its list of the 100 greatest artists of all time. Despite this acclaim, the band has had several feuds with the corporate side of the recording industry. In 2007, these corporate entanglements resulted in Reznor announcing that Nine Inch Nails would split from its label and release future material independently. Since 1989, Nine Inch Nails has released eight studio albums. After a hiatus from 2009 to 2013, Nine Inch Nails released Hesitation Marks, through Columbia Records. Prior to this, Ghosts I\u2013IV and The Slip were both independently released in digital form, with physical releases coming later. The digital release of the latter was made available completely free of charge, and the former, while also available for sale, can be acquired legally through means such as file-sharing due to its Creative Commons license. Nine Inch Nails has been nominated for thirteen Grammy Awards and won twice for the songs \"Wish\" and \"Happiness in Slavery\", in 1992 and 1996 respectively. In 2014, Nine Inch Nails was named as nominees for induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, their first year of eligibility. In 2015, they were nominated a second time."@en ;

Slayer rose to fame with its 1986 release Reign in Blood, and is credited as one of the \"big four\" thrash metal bands, along with Metallica, Megadeth, and Anthrax. Since its debut album in 1983, the band has released twelve studio albums, two live albums, a box set, six music videos, two extended plays and a cover album. Four of the band's studio albums have received gold certification in the United States. The band has received five Grammy nominations, winning one in 2007 for the song \"Eyes of the Insane\", and one in 2008 for the song \"Final Six\" (both from 2006's Christ Illusion). Slayer has also played at several music festivals worldwide, including Unholy Alliance, Download and Ozzfest. Slayer's musical style involves fast tremolo picking, double bass drumming, riffs in irregular scales and shouted vocals. In the original line-up, King, Hanneman, and lead vocalist/bassist Tom Araya contributed to the band's lyrics, and most of the band's music was written by King and Hanneman, with additional help from Araya and drummer Dave Lombardo. The band's lyrics and album art, which cover topics such as murder, serial killers, necrophilia, torture, genocide, human experimentation, Satanism, hate crimes, terrorism, religion, antireligion, Nazism, and warfare, have generated album bans, delays, lawsuits, and criticism from religious groups and the public. However, its music has been highly influential, often being cited by many bands as an influence musically, visually, and lyrically. Between 1991 and 2013, the band sold 4.9 million albums in the United States."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Supr\u00EAme NTM (or simply NTM) is a French hip hop group formed in 1989 in the Seine-Saint-Denis d\u00E9partement. The group comprises rappers Joey Starr (born Didier Morville) and Kool Shen (born Bruno Lopes). Their six albums were released by Sony Music Entertainment. The group takes its name from the French slang \"NTM\", an acronym for \"Nique Ta M\u00E8re\" (\"Nique\" is derived from the shortening of the French word forniquer (fornicate)) meaning \"fuck your mother\". Supreme NTM is known for their hostility towards the police, violent lyrics, and legal battles with the French authorities. Their musical style is predominantly hardcore rap, although later albums include funk, soul and reggae influences. The group is outspokenly critical of racism and class inequality in French society, and while their earlier music is violent, some of their later work, such as \"Pose ton Gun\" (\"Put down your Gun\"), is explicitly anti-violent. In 1998, the group released its last album of original material under the NTM moniker, as both Joey Starr and Kool Shen started their own labels, promoting new bands and branching out in other fields such as the clothing industry (2High is Kool Shen's brand, Com-8 is Joey Starr's). While officially the band still exists, and its well-known name was used in 2001 to promote a 'duel' album pitting the two labels' artists against each other, Kool Shen was quoted in 2004 saying \"on a fini avec NTM en 98\" (\"We finished with NTM in 1998\"). The group is known for its gritty, dark and sometimes violent lyrics, as well as for the contrast between the two rappers' styles. While Joey Starr (also known as Jaguar Gorgonne and Double-R) has a relatively slow flow, aggressive lyrics and a deep, booming voice (which he sometimes uses to yell such as in \"Pose ton Gun\"), Kool Shen has a funkier flow as well as witty and rather melancholic lyrics.[citation needed]"@en ;

To date, the pair have only performed as the 5:15ers once, at the ArthurBall held at the Echoplex, a club in Echo Park, California. The set was a mix of tracks from both their respective careers, including a number of Masters of Reality songs, \"100 Days\" from Mark Lanegan's Bubblegum (Which both Goss and Homme contributed to) and \"You Would Know\" by Queens of the Stone Age. Another song played was a cover of \"Space For Rent\" by the Danish three-piece WhoMadeWho. The performance also included original work, with the song \"Into the Hollow\" later appearing on Era Vulgaris. When asked in February 2007 about the future of the project, Goss answered, \"There will be one show and more to follow. We're focusing on the show, but we have talked about doing a record\". Despite this, nothing has come into fruition since. On the band's musical direction, Goss opined that \"[It will be] something that's neither Masters of Reality or Queens of the Stone Age.

dbr:Four_Tops	rdf:type	dbo:Band ;
	dbo:abstract	"The Four Tops are an American vocal quartet from Detroit, Michigan who helped to define the city's Motown sound of the 1960s. The group's repertoire has included soul music, R&B, disco, adult contemporary, doo-wop, jazz, and show tunes. Founded as The Four Aims, lead singer Levi Stubbs, and groupmates Abdul \"Duke\" Fakir, Renaldo \"Obie\" Benson and Lawrence Payton remained together for over four decades, having gone from 1953 until 1997 without a change in personnel. The Four Tops were among a number of groups, including The Miracles, The Marvelettes, Martha and the Vandellas, The Temptations, and The Supremes, who established the Motown Sound around the world during the 1960s. They were notable for having Stubbs, a baritone, as their lead singer, whereas most male/mixed vocal groups of the time were fronted by a tenor. The group was the main male vocal group for the highly successful songwriting and production team of Holland\u2013Dozier\u2013Holland, who crafted a stream of hit singles on Motown. These included two Billboard Hot 100 number-one hits for the Tops: \"I Can't Help Myself (Sugar Pie Honey Bunch)\" in 1965 and \"Reach Out I'll Be There\" in 1966. After Holland-Dozier-Holland left Motown in 1967, the Four Tops were assigned to a number of producers, primarily Frank Wilson, but generally with less success. When Motown left Detroit in 1972 to move to Los Angeles, California, the Tops stayed in Detroit but signed a new recording deal with ABC Records' Dunhill imprint. Recording mainly in Los Angeles, they continued to have chart singles into the late 1970s, including the million-seller, \"Ain't No Woman\", their second release on Dunhill, produced by Steve Barri and composers Dennis Lambert and Brian Potter. In the 1980s, the Four Tops recorded for Casablanca Records, Arista Records and Motown, returning to that label on two occasions for brief stays. Apart from their Indestructible album (owned by Sony Music Entertainment), Universal Music Group controls the rights to their entire post-1963 catalog (through various mergers and acquisitions), as well as their 1956 single, \"Could It Be You\". A change of line-up was finally forced upon the group when Lawrence Payton died on June 20, 1997. The group initially continued as a three-piece under the name The Tops, before Theo Peoples (formerly of The Temptations) was recruited as the new fourth member. Peoples eventually took over the role of lead singer when Stubbs suffered a stroke in 2000, with Ronnie McNeir then joining the group. On July 1, 2005, Benson died of lung cancer with Payton's son Roquel Payton replacing him. Levi Stubbs died on October 17, 2008. Fakir, McNeir, Payton, and Harold \"Spike\" Bonhart, who replaced Peoples in 2011, are still performing together as the Four Tops. As of 2014, fifty years after their first Motown hit, Fakir is the only surviving founding member of the original group and Payton is a second-generation member."@en ;

dbr:Theodore_Unit	rdf:type	dbo:Band ;
	dbo:abstract	"Theodore Unit is a loose collective of Staten Island rappers associated with the Wu-Tang Clan's rapper and executive Ghostface Killah. The name \"Theodore\" is derived from \"The Open Door\", meaning the group acts as an open door to rappers who can prove themselves. It has also been stated it stands for \"The Doers\", as in those with initiative and will. The group's origins begin with Ghostface's 2001 album, Bulletproof Wallets, on the track \"Theodore\", which featured rappers Trife da God and Twiz, both of whom would become members of Ghost's posse. (Though Twiz was also formerly of Raekwon's crew American Cream Team) Trife, along with Kryme Life, would leave their trio T.M.F. to join the newly named \"Theodore Unit\", as would Shawn Wigs and Du-Lilz of Othorized F.A.M.. The crew was initially supposed to include Raekwon and Polite, but they then chose to form on their own, as Cream Team had been dissolved and they were launching Ice Water. Instead, the line-up held together with Solomon Childs and long-standing Wu-affiliate Cappadonna, as features on Theodore Unit's debut album, 718 (named after the Stapleton, Staten Island area code in which they all reside). However, the album would largely feature Trife da God and - naturally - Ghostface Killah, with only solitary appearances from Kryme Life and Du-Lilz; Twiz was not featured. (Indeed, he was to not be part of neither Cream Team nor Theodore for too long) Solomon Childs, while having the third-largest presence on the album, left the group for unknown reasons in 2005. The following month, Ghostface Killah and Trife da God's Put It on the Line was released, which featured Kryme Life, Shawn Wigs, and Theodore Unit newcomer Sun God, who is also Ghostface's son. The album also had the notable presence of Trife's former T.M.F. bandmate Tommy Whispers. A mixtape was released the next year, featuring mostly Ghost and Trife called NY's Backbone. In recent years, the group has made guest appearances on Ghostface's 2006 albums Fishscale, More Fish (the Theodore logo even appears on the cover), The Big Doe Rehab and the album Apollo Kids."@en ;

They have spent a total of 180 weeks on the singles and albums charts combined as of 2012, and have accumulated 25 top 75 singles between 1997 and 2012. Feeder's music has been inspired by a wide variety of artists and styles, including The Police, Nirvana, and The Smashing Pumpkins. Their early material showcased a heavy rock sound reminiscent of grunge, but the band would later introduce more acoustic aspects into their music, including elements of pianos and string orchestras. The band was formed in 1992 under the name of \"Reel\" by vocalist and guitarist Grant Nicholas, drummer Jon Lee and bassist Simon Blight, three of the four members of Raindancer, after the departure of that band's other member, guitarist John Canham. However, Blight left Reel later in 1992, and the band played with many session bassists before hiring Taka Hirose in 1995, a year after the band signed with The Echo Label. Feeder garnered media attention in 2001 for their third album, Echo Park, and its lead single, \"Buck Rogers\", which later become a UK Top 5 single. In January 2002, Jon Lee committed suicide in his Miami home, after which the remaining members began to record and play with former Skunk Anansie drummer Mark Richardson. They released their fourth album, Comfort in Sound later that year, which touched on themes such as loss and coming to terms with death, while also exploring themes of positivity. Richardson was ultimately made an official member, remaining so until May 2009 when he returned to a reformed Skunk Anansie. Feeder employed Australian Damon Wilson and former Mexicolas drummer Tim Trotter for sessions and touring commitments for Renegades (2010), and they have since employed drummer Karl Brazil. Although the band have not had a top 10 release since 2008, they have still charted two more Top 20 albums, with the latest being 2012's Generation Freakshow."@en ;

At their shows they played some original DBX songs as well as some tunes from Death Piggy, Gwar, and X-Cops. The band enjoyed a following mostly made up of Gwar fans. Dave Brockie hinted at the possibility of the band's breakup in the past due to the exhausting nature of lower-budget touring. In February 2008, several sources reported that the band would be touring as an opening act for the reunited Green Jell\u00FF. Dave Brockie stated, on his website, that this was not the case and there were no official discussions concerning the tour. DBX played two reunion shows in August 2009. In a more recent interview with Dave Brockie he explained a new DBX album was \"possible\" but said his main priority then was Gwar. Brockie died of a heroin overdose in March 2014."@en ;

dbr:Lačni_Franz	rdf:type	dbo:Band ;
	dbo:abstract	"La\u010Dni Franz was a rock band from Slovenia that was also popular in the 1980s in Titoist Yugoslavia. While they were inspired by another Slovenian radical band Buldo\u017Eer known for utilizing sheer madness in the social and political satire, their lyrics is more self-ironic. The band was formed in Maribor in June 1979. Their name, meaning hungry Franz, is a pun on the name of a character from the novel Catch-22, Hungry Joe, and describes hunger for rock music. The band's music and attitude was a kind of laid back, and they portrayed themselves as a local band from a provincial town. Zoran Predin's lyrics ranged from disturbing ballads (Ne mi dihat za ovratnik, Lipa zelenela je), through love songs (\u010Cakaj me, Naj ti poljub nari\u0161e ustnice), to social and political satire (Praslovan, Na\u0161a Lidija je pri vojakih). The key band members were frontman and songwriter Zoran Predin, and guitarist Oto Rimele. The band made the most creative success by the end of the 1980s, with classical albums such as Ikebana, Adijo pamet, Ne mi dihat za ovratnik, and Na svoji strani (the last one made with the original crew). Their last studio album was released in 1994. La\u010Dni Franz officially ceased to exist in 1997 after a series of compilation albums. Zoran Predin continued solo career after the Franz disbanded. Many band's hits, such as Praslovan, Bog nima telefona, Vaterpolist, Ne mi dihat za ovratnik, \u010Cakaj me or Naj ti poljub nari\u0161e ustnice, have remained in his concert repertoire. The band briefly regathered in winter 2005 - 2006, and held a series of concerts in Slovenia, Belgrade, and Zagreb."@en ;

dbr:The_Seldon_Plan	rdf:type	dbo:Band ;
	dbo:abstract	"The Seldon Plan is a post-rock pop band from Baltimore, Maryland, United States. It consists of Michael Nestor on guitars, keyboards and vocals and David Hirner on bass. Since 2008, Nestor and Hirner have used a rotating core of fill-in musicians to put out records. Although The Seldon Plan is primarily associated with the indie rock scene in the Northeast U.S., they have had national print, radio and television exposure and are featured in popular iPhone applications. While primarily playing indie rock that is reminiscent of The Weakerthans, The Feelies, Nada Surf and Camera Obscura an aspect of their sound has been compared to that of emo. Though recent records have increasingly been influenced by both indie pop and traditional pop. The band was founded in 2003 by original guitarist Bobby Landle and bassist Dave Hirner. Landle chose the name for the band because of a lifelong fascination with Isaac Asimov. In late 2003 Hirner and Landle met Michael Nestor while he was working on a Ph.D. in neuroscience at the University of Maryland School of Medicine via an ad placed on a local music website. The band played a few shows using a drum machine and sometimes with fill-in drummer Austin Stahl. The earliest Seldon Plan demos feature Stahl on drums. While playing shows, the trio met drummer Mike Landavere, a traditional jazz drummer, and decided to take the band more seriously allowing Stahl to work on other projects like The Beechfields Record Label, which released the first Seldon Plan EP. The Seldon Plan started off by playing in non-traditional venues in and around Baltimore like art galleries and DIY spaces. Many of their early shows were part of the DIY renaissance that began in the Baltimore music scene around 2004. During the early history of the band, they gained notoriety by inviting artists, poets, and filmmakers to display their work at their concerts. With the line-up of Landle, Landavere, Hirner and Nestor, The Seldon Plan took on a busy tour schedule during 2005-2007 releasing two critically acclaimed full-length records and playing shows with Explosions in the Sky, The Stills, Now It's Overhead, The Octopus Project and Matt Pond PA. In August 2008 the band announced the addition of a new drummer and a new guitarist as both Mike Landavere (drums) and Bobby Landle (guitars and vocals) left the band. The Seldon Plan was subsequently highlighted along with Joan as Police Woman and Jason Mraz in the December, 2008 edition of the Music Alive! magazine. In April 2009, to announce the reformation of the band, and promote their new record, Lost and Found and Lost, the band offered a limited-time-only free download of the title track. The single was immediately highlighted by The Baltimore Sun in a multimedia showcase and Arts & Life piece discussing creativity as an outlet for economic woes."@en ;

Their music mainly consists of their own compositions, based on strong Celtic roots and typically featuring intricate acoustic guitar playing and close harmony singing.

	dbo:abstract	"Sugarplum Fairy is a pop-rock band from Borl\u00E4nge, Sweden. The members took the name from a version of the Beatles' song \"A Day in the Life\" where John Lennon counts the song in by saying \"sugar-plum-fairy, sugar-plum-fairy\". Sugarplum Fairy was founded in 1998 by Victor and Carl Noren and Kristian Gidlund. The band released several demos before being signed to EMI Records in 2004, releasing the EP Stay Young to generally positive reviews. Later they released their first single, \"Sweet Jackie\", from their first full-length album \"Young & Armed\" released later that year (September 29, 2004). The band toured heavily in Sweden, Japan and Germany, and released the debut album in different editions in both Japan and Germany in early 2005. In 2006 they put out their second record, \"First Round First Minute\". A third album followed in 2008, including a cover of The Hollies' Bus Stop. In 2009 the band went on hiatus. In 2011 drummer Kristian Gidlund was diagnosed with stomach cancer. He died from the illness in 2013. Apart from their music, the band is also famous for the fact that the two singers in the band are brothers of Gustaf Nor\u00E9n, singer in Mando Diao."@en ;

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Criteria_(band)>	rdf:type	dbo:Band ;
	dbo:abstract	"Criteria is an indie rock band from Omaha, Nebraska, formed in 2003 when ex-Cursive founding member Steve Pedersen returned to his hometown after graduating from the Duke University School of Law. He spent six months in a friend's basement where he wrote all ten songs for his new project's debut album. He recruited the help of some old friends, A.J. Mogis (of Presto! Recording Studios and Lullaby for the Working Class) on bass guitar, Aaron Druery on guitar, and Mike Sweeney of Beep Beep on drums. Their first album, En Garde, was released on his previous band's label, Initial Records. Steve Pedersen eventually got a day job as a lawyer, making it hard for the band to go on tour to promote their new album. Initial Records went bankrupt about a year after, leaving Criteria without a label. Saddle Creek Records took their longtime friend in and put out three releases in 2005. The first was a re-release of the overlooked and underrated En Garde, their new single, \"Prevent the World,\" and their second full-length, When We Break. After being moved into Saddle Creek, Pedersen quit his day job to spend full-time making music and touring. Criteria has performed with bands such as Cursive, The Fall of Troy, Thunderbirds Are Now!, Statistics, Poison the Well, Rahim (band), and Minus the Bear. The band performed at the Maha Musical Festival on August 17, 2013 in Omaha, Nebraska. Criteria's most recent performance took place on December 12, 2013 at the Waiting Room Lounge in Omaha, during which Pedersen mentioned the band was working on a new album."@en ;

dbr:Chick_Corea_Elektric_Band	rdf:type	dbo:Band ;
	dbo:abstract	"Chick Corea Elektric Band is a jazz fusion band, led by pianist Chick Corea. Following the demise of Return to Forever, Corea established the musical ensemble in 1986. Following a long hiatus, the band reunited to produce To the Stars in 2004. The band's debut album can be described as \"jazz-rock\", though it is much closer to traditional jazz than the jazz-rock albums of the 1970s. The keyboard sounds on the album are typical for the mid-1980s. The drums played by Dave Weckl dominate the album's sound, with the guitar duties split between Scott Henderson and Carlos Rios. The second album, Light Years (1987) is more funk-oriented than its predecessor. Saxophonist Eric Marienthal joins the band and Frank Gambale replaces Henderson and Rios (who still plays on some tracks) to form what is considered the band's definitive lineup. The third album, Eye of the Beholder, relies on softer sounds. Here Corea relies on acoustic piano, with synthesizers largely in the background. Gambale also plays acoustic guitar on some tracks, lending a Flamenco-influenced sound to pieces like \"Eternal Child.\" The Elektric Band's fourth album, Inside Out (1990), features some compositions that fall in the post-bop rather than the fusion category. The four-part piece \"Tale of Daring\", which closes the album, relies on unconventional melodies and relatively free improvisation. But two other compositions, the title track and \"Kicker,\" are more traditional fusion pieces. Corea still uses mostly acoustic piano, but Gambale plays electric guitar throughout. The last album featuring the band's traditional lineup was Beneath the Mask (1991), a return to the electric jazz-funk of the second album. For the next album, Elektric Band II: Paint the World (1993), only Corea and Marienthal returned from the original lineup. Gary Novak became the new drummer, Jimmy Earl took the bass, and Mike Miller played guitar. The album's style can be described as modern jazz, crossing between post-bop and fusion. In 1996, the band teamed up with Steve Vai's Monsters to record a version of \"Rumble\" from West Side Story for the RCA Victor tribute album called The Songs of West Side Story. The original members reunited in 2004 for To the Stars (2004), which is stylistically close to the avant-garde and post-bop on Inside Out. After the final studio album the band has toured also with Victor Wooten who has replaced Patitucci."@en ;

The band came together in 1994, when a select group of musicians were asked to perform at a record release party for the landmark acid jazz and club staple \u201CFreestylin\u201D by San Diego\u2019s DJ Greyboy, who was well known for spinning `70s soul and funk. The group enjoyed playing together, and decided to continue on as a band. The Greyboy Allstars started playing weekly at San Diego\u2019s now defunct Green Circle, weekends at San Francisco\u2019s Elbo Room and various clubs throughout Europe. By playing danceable boogaloo music within the soul and jazz genres, they became very popular both nationally and internationally. The lineup of the band remains nearly the same, with Karl Denson on horns and vocals, Robert Walter on keyboards, Elgin Park (aka Michael Andrews) on guitars and vocals, and Chris Stillwell on bass. Original drummer Zak Najor was replaced by Aaron Redfield, an old friend of the band and frequent collaborator. While DJ Greyboy is no longer a member of the band, he remains a central figure in their artistic output, having introduced the band to many of the records that inspire their sound, produced their first album and appeared on 2007\u2032s What Happened to Television? Individual members of the group have gone on to score film and television shows, work with platinum artists and bands both on the road and in the studio, and head their own solo projects.[citation needed] For Inland Emperor, they worked out the arrangements during the recording, which took place live over just a few sessions at Elgin Park\u2019s studio in Glendale, CA. Denson says of this accelerated pace of creation, \u201CWe do in one week would take me two months to do in any other situation.\u201D Grammy Award-winning producer/engineer Mickey Petralia (Beck, Peaches, Eels, Flight of the Conchords) mixed the tracks."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Army of the Pharaohs (most commonly abbreviated as AOTP or A.O.T.P.) is an American underground hip hop collective originating from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, formed by Jedi Mind Tricks MC Vinnie Paz in 1998. The group has strong links to other underground groups such as; OuterSpace, Snowgoons, La Coka Nostra, Demigodz and Jedi Mind Tricks. It has changed several times ever since its formation. Paz formed the outfit in the late 1990s with the original roster of Bahamadia, Chief Kamachi, Virtuoso, 7L & Esoteric, plus Jedi Mind Tricks' other member Stoupe the Enemy of Mankind. The group first released the \"Five Perfect Exertions\" and \"War Ensemble\" 12\" on Paz's short-lived Recordings in 1998, but then the underground supergroup remained silent for several years. After a couple of successful Jedi Mind Tricks albums and a new deal with Babygrande by 2003, Paz resurrected the crew, adding OuterSpace, Celph Titled, Reef the Lost Cauze, King Syze, Des Devious, and Apathy; however, Stoupe, Bahamadia, and Virtuoso had defected from the group. Babygrande issued their \"Tear It Down\" 12\" and first album, The Torture Papers, in 2006. The 2007 follow-up album, Ritual of Battle, saw Jus Allah and JMT prot\u00E9g\u00E9s Doap Nixon and Demoz joining the Pharaohs. The Unholy Terror was released on March 30, 2010. This album marked the return of Apathy and the addition of two new AOTP members, Block McCloud Journalist. Two songs, \"Godzilla\" and \"Contra Mantra\", were released before the album. This album also marked the departure of Chief Kamachi who left the group because of business issues and an apparent feud with Vinnie Paz & Apathy. In early 2011, Vinnie Paz announced on his Facebook page that In Death Reborn is due to be released in 2012, however the date was pushed back and almost seemed like it was never going to be released. Early in 2012, Houston underground MC Zilla and Connecticut's Blacastan were added to the group. Both artists have made names for themselves with their features and album releases in 2012. In Death Reborn was eventually released on April 22, 2014. The album featured members Vinnie Paz, Apathy, Blacastan, Block McCloud, Celph Titled, Demoz, Des Devious, Doap Nixon, Esoteric, Lawrence Arnell, King Magnetic, King Syze, OuterSpace, Reef the Lost Cauze and Zilla. Their fifth studio album, Heavy Lies the Crown was released on October 21, 2014."@en ;

Formed in 1996 in Shepparton, Victoria, the band currently consists of vocalist and rhythm guitarist Glenn Richards, lead guitarist Adam Donovan, bassist Edmondo Ammendola, drummer David Williams, and keyboardist Kiernan Box. Box replaced Rob Dawson, the band's initial piano player, who died in 2001. Augie March's rise to fame was slow; their first two EPs failed to make an impact on the market, despite Waltz being nominated for two ARIA Awards. Their first album, Sunset Studies, was released in 2000. Despite poor sales, it was critically acclaimed and received an ARIA Award nomination. Critics in both Australia and the United States also lauded its 2002 successor, Strange Bird, but it sold and charted poorly in both countries. Augie March's third album, Moo, You Bloody Choir (2006), received a much better reception in terms of sales; its lead single \"One Crowded Hour\" attained critical acclaim and appeared on the ARIA Charts at number 29, while the album was nominated for numerous ARIA Awards and won an Australian Music Prize. Having achieved mainstream success, the band toured Australia and the United States regularly through 2006 and 2007. In 2008 they released their fourth album, Watch Me Disappear. It became their most commercially successful album, but received the least favourable critical reception. Augie March's distinctive musical style is directed by songwriter and vocalist Richards. His lyrics often draw critical acclaim for their poetic style. The band's music is generally described as intricate, lush, and dense, acting as a backdrop for Richards' complex and poetic vocals."@en ;

The band released their third record When the Deer Wore Blue in 2007 with Chicago-based co-producer/engineer Jeremy Lemos, who has worked with Smog, Jim O'Rourke, Loose Fur, and many other Windy City acts in the past. The new material is more psychedelic than previous efforts, but remains faithful to the melodic-pop sounds of Skeleton and Shake a Mountain on several tracks, including \"Hey, Girl\", the first single from the record. In 2010 they released their 4th record titled \"Figurines\"."@en ;

dbr:On_Broken_Wings	rdf:type	dbo:Band ;
	dbo:abstract	"On Broken Wings is an American metalcore band from Hull, Massachusetts that formed in 2001. Often credited with pioneering the sound, and coining the term, of \"moshcore\", a term originally used by the band to describe their fusion of metal with elements of post-hardcore and hardcore breakdowns. This sound is heard in current bands like Emmure and Recon. After the self-released Number One Beautiful EP, they caught the attention of Eulogy Recordings, where they would then release 2 full-length albums over the next 5 years, 2003's 'Some of us may Never see the World' and 2005's 'It's all a Long Goodbye'. During this time, On Broken Wings was also subject to a variety of controversies, mostly concerning their unusually violent live shows and the band's apparent encouragement of crowd violence. As a result, the band is still banned from many clubs and venues across the United States. In early 2007, On Broken Wings released an EP entitled Going Down which contained the original Number One Beautiful EP as well as 4 new songs. In an ironic twist, the title of the EP was soon considered foreshadowing as the band announced an indefinite hiatus mainly due to interest in other projects. Many considered OBW to have split up for good until a new year rolled around... After a long hiatus, 2008 finally sees the band reuniting and doing some serious touring with the 'Mosh Lives' tour featuring headliners, Emmure and other metalcore acts such as Recon, Ligeia and on select dates, Red I Flight and Endwell."@en ;

The project's first EP, V\u00EAn, was released in 2003. V\u00EAn was a studio project of Glanzmann's, but its success led to the recruitment of a full band. The band then released a full-length album, Spirit, in June 2006. In November 2007, Eluveitie was signed by Nuclear Blast. The group rose to fame following the release of their first major-label album, Slania, in February 2008. The album peaked at number 35 in the Swiss charts and number 72 in the German charts. Eluveitie describe themselves as \"The new wave of folk metal\". The band's style incorporates characteristics of melodic death metal combined with the melodies of traditional Celtic music. They use traditional European instruments, including the hurdy-gurdy and bagpipes, amidst guitars and both clean and harsh vocals. Their lyrics include references to Celtic mythology, particularly the Celtic Gaul village. The lyrics are often in the extinct ancient language Gaulish. The name of the band comes from graffiti on a vessel from Mantua (ca. 300 BC). The inscription in Etruscan letters reads eluveitie, which has been interpreted as the Etruscan form of the Celtic (h)elvetios (\u201Cthe Helvetian\u201D), presumably referring to a man of Helvetian descent living in Mantua."@en ;

dbr:Alkaline_Trio	rdf:type	dbo:Band ;
	dbo:abstract	"Alkaline Trio is an American pop punk band from McHenry, Illinois. The band consists of guitarist and vocalist Matt Skiba, bassist and vocalist Dan Andriano, and drummer Derek Grant. Founded in late 1996 by Skiba, bassist Rob Doran, and drummer Glenn Porter, Alkaline Trio released its debut single, \"Sundials\", in 1997. Following its release, Doran departed from the band and was replaced by Dan Andriano. The band subsequently recorded an EP, For Your Lungs Only (1998), and its debut studio album, Goddamnit (1998). Following the release of the band's second album, Maybe I'll Catch Fire (2000), Porter left the band and was replaced by Mike Felumlee for its subsequent album, From Here to Infirmary (2001). Backed by the singles \"Stupid Kid\" and \"Private Eye\", From Here to Infirmary significantly increased the band's exposure, and its follow-up, Good Mourning (2003), charted highly on the Billboard 200. Good Mourning marked the recording debut of current drummer Derek Grant. In 2005, the band released Crimson which expanded upon the band's punk rock influences, with prominent overdubs and additional instrumentation, and continued with this direction on Agony & Irony (2008), which was released on V2 Records. In 2010, the band released This Addiction on its own label Heart & Skull and Epitaph. Recorded in the band's home town of Chicago, with early producer Matt Allison, the album was a conscious effort by the band to return to their punk rock roots; it became the highest charting album of their career, debuting on the Billboard 200 at No. 11. In 2011, the band celebrated its 15-year anniversary with the release of Damnesia, which featured new, acoustic-based recordings of songs from across the band's career. The band's eighth studio album, My Shame Is True, was released on April 2, 2013."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Ash is a Northern Irish alternative rock band, formed in Downpatrick in 1992 by vocalist and guitarist Tim Wheeler, bassist Mark Hamilton and drummer Rick McMurray. As a three-piece, they released mini-album Trailer in 1994, followed by 1977 in 1996. This 1996 release was named by NME as one of the 500 greatest albums of all time. After the success of their full debut the band recruited Charlotte Hatherley as a guitarist and vocalist, releasing their second record Nu-Clear Sounds in 1998. After narrowly avoiding bankruptcy the band released Free All Angels in 2001 and a string of successful singles. Their fourth record Meltdown, released in 2004, was the band's final record with Hatherley before returning to their original three-piece lineup for their fifth studio album Twilight of the Innocents in 2007. After five conventional albums the band released 26 singles in The A-Z Series in 2009, one every two weeks. The band have had one silver, two gold and two platinum-selling (and chart-topping) records in the United Kingdom, as well as 18 songs in the top 40 of the UK Singles Chart. In 2015, they released a sixth studio album, entitled Kablammo!. They were associated with Britpop, though as that musical movement emphasised Britishness which is a controversial state in Northern Ireland, they were not comfortable with the association."@en ;

Though their 1989 debut album Blood, Sweat and No Tears was a moderate success, Sick of It All did not achieve commercial success until further albums. After the release of their 1992 second album Just Look Around, East West Records saw the band's potential and signed them in 1993.

Their 1997 follow-up Built to Last was also highly acclaimed.

The British Hit Singles & Albums names them as the most successful British group of the 1970s based on sales of singles. They were the first act to achieve three singles enter at number one; all six of the band's chart-toppers were penned by Noddy Holder and Jim Lea. Total UK sales stand at 6,520,171, and their best-selling single, \"Merry Xmas Everybody\", has sold in excess of one million copies. Following an unsuccessful move to the United States in 1975, Slade's popularity waned but was unexpectedly revived in 1980 when they were last minute replacements for Ozzy Osbourne at the Reading Rock Festival. The band later acknowledged this to have been one of the highlights of their career. The original line up split in 1992 but the band reformed the following year as Slade II. The band has continued, with a number of line-up changes, to the present day. They have now shortened the group name back to Slade. A number of diverse artists have cited Slade as an influence, including alternative rock icons Nirvana and the Smashing Pumpkins, punk pioneers the Ramones, Sex Pistols, the Undertones, the Runaways and the Clash, glam metal bands Kiss, M\u00F6tley Cr\u00FCe, Twisted Sister, Quiet Riot, Poison and Def Leppard and pop-rock stalwarts the Replacements, Cheap Trick and Oasis.

Their musical style has been variously described as psychobilly, Southern rock, hard rock and cowpunk, as well as \"sleaze rock\". The band's lyrical themes mostly revolve around sex, drugs, drinking, fighting, and rock 'n' roll. Initially called Hell's Half-Acre, the band's name comes from Ted Nugent's introduction to \"Wang Dang Sweet Poontang\" on the Double Live Gonzo album. Following the initial 1997 breakup of Kentucky cowpunk band Nine Pound Hammer, guitarist Blaine Cartwright formed Nashville Pussy where he would take up vocal duties in addition to guitar. The core lineup of Nashville Pussy consists of husband-and-wife duo Blaine Cartwright and Ruyter Suys (pronounced \"Rider Sighs\"), and drummer Jeremy Thompson. Original drummer Adam Neal (Nine Pound Hammer) left to form The Hookers. Original bassist Corey Parks (sister of former NBA basketball player Cherokee Parks) quit one month after the release of the album High as Hell, and later joined Die Hunns. Tracy Almazan aka Tracy Kickass formerly of NYC's The Wives, and Helldorado was enlisted to replace Parks mid-tour. Nashville Pussy recorded Say Something Nasty with Almazan on bass only to be replaced by Katielyn Campbell (of the band Famous Monsters). Katie Lynn's image is on the album Say Something Nasty. Campbell was subsequently replaced by Karen Cuda for the album Get Some. Karen Cuda also appeared as bassist on the album \"From Hell To Texas\", and in the live DVD Live in Hollywood.

The band was one of the most popular and most influential acts of the Yugoslav rock scene. Riblja \u010Corba was formed in 1978 by vocalist Bora \u0110or\u0111evi\u0107, guitarist Rajko Koji\u0107, bass guitarist Mi\u0161a Aleksi\u0107 and drummer Vicko Milatovi\u0107. Their debut release, the single \"Lutka sa naslovne strane\" (1978), saw huge success and launched them to fame. They were soon joined by guitarist Mom\u010Dilo Bajagi\u0107 \"Bajaga\", the new lineup releasing the album Kost u grlu (1979), which was, largely due to \u0110or\u0111evi\u0107's social-related lyrics, a huge commercial and critical success. Their following releases, Pokvarena ma\u0161ta i prljave strasti (1981), Mrtva priroda (1981) and Buvlja pijaca (1982) launched them to the top of the Yugoslav rock scene; \u0110or\u0111evi\u0107's provocative social- and political-related lyrics were praised by the critics and often caused media scandals. In the mid 1980s, the band saw a slight decline in popularity, but made a triumphant comeback with the album Istina (1985), recorded with new guitar duo, Vidoja \"D\u017Eind\u017Eer\" Bo\u017Einovi\u0107 and Nikola \u010Cuturilo. Until the end of the decade and breakup of Yugoslavia, the band managed to sustain their popularity, but after the beginning of Yugoslav wars it heavily declined in Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina, due to \u0110or\u0111evi\u0107's support for Serbian nationalism. However, \u0110or\u0111evi\u0107 also opposed the regime of Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107, demonstrating his attitude on the albums Riblja \u010Corba recorded during the 1990s. Since the beginning of the 2000s, the band manages to remain one of the top acts of the Serbian rock scene, although the albums they released during the 2000s and 2010s saw little critical success."@en ;

dbr:Pearl_Jam	rdf:type	dbo:Band ;
	dbo:abstract	"Pearl Jam is an American rock band, formed in Seattle, Washington, in 1990. Since its inception, the band's line-up has comprised Eddie Vedder (lead vocals), Mike McCready (lead guitar), Stone Gossard (rhythm guitar) and Jeff Ament (bass). The band's fifth member is drummer Matt Cameron (also of Soundgarden), who has been with the band since 1998. Boom Gaspar (piano) has also been a session/touring member with the band since 2002. Drummers Dave Krusen, Matt Chamberlain, Dave Abbruzzese and Jack Irons are former members of the band. Formed after the demise of Gossard and Ament's previous band, Mother Love Bone, Pearl Jam broke into the mainstream with its debut album, Ten, in 1991. One of the key bands in the grunge movement of the early 1990s, over the course of the band's career, its members became noted for their refusal to adhere to traditional music industry practices, including refusing to make proper music videos or give interviews, and engaging in a much-publicized boycott of Ticketmaster. In 2006, Rolling Stone described the band as having \"spent much of the past decade deliberately tearing apart their own fame.\" To date, the band has sold nearly 32 million records in the U.S. and an estimated 60 million worldwide. Pearl Jam has outlasted and outsold many of its contemporaries from the alternative rock breakthrough of the early 1990s, and is considered one of the most influential bands of that decade. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic referred to Pearl Jam as \"the most popular American rock & roll band of the '90s.\""@en ;

Roach was born in Newport News, Virginia, but his family moved to his parents ancestral home in Duffield, Virginia when Roach was still very young. As a teenager, Roach reportedly spent a number of months under the tutelage of cult blues guitarist Washboard Williams; however this rumor has never been properly substantiated, and Roach's playing style does not suggest such tutelage. After attending college in Virginia, Roach lived in several different cities on the east coast of the United States before moving to San Francisco. The move to San Francisco was a turning point for Roach's musical career. There he met and befriended musicians like Tom Meshishnik, Todd Sickafoose, Sean Hayes and Noe Venable. The musical impact that these relationships had on Roach can be heard on Dogwood Winter, his first studio album. The album was jointly produced by Meshishnik and Sickafoose, and features Venable on backing vocals on several tracks."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"ACT-I-VATE is an American webcomics collective based on an original idea by Dean Haspiel and founded by Haspiel and seven other cartoonists. It started out on the blogging platform Livejournal, but has now moved to its own dedicated website. The ACT-I-VATE collective features serialized graphic novels from over twenty-five hand-picked professional cartoonists (each of whom generally adds a new episode weekly), and is updated daily. ACT-I-VATE's artists are unpaid, and produce their work without editorial oversight. ACT-I-VATE is also free to view. In addition to the high-quality comics, the site is known for its vocal community of readers and the lengthy discussion threads between artist and reader. ACT-I-VATE debuted on February 1, 2006, with eight cartoonists, and added four more members on April 5, 2006. Since then, the collective has added new hand-picked cartoonists at a regular rate to achieve its current membership. ACT-I-VATE rose to prominence when many of its artists, including Haspiel, Michel Fiffe, Mike Cavallaro, Dan Goldman, and Nick Bertozzi, began to receive publishing deals. Haspiel and Fiffe's three-issue mini-series, Brawl, a \"creature romance double feature\" featuring Haspiel's \"Immortal\" (starring Billy Dogma) and Fiffe's \"Panorama,\" which both originated on ACT-I-VATE, was published by Image Comics in the Fall of 2007. Similarly, Parade (with Fireworks), by Mike Cavallaro, began on ACT-I-VATE, was first excerpted in New York Magazine, and later published by Image. Other ACT-I-VATE members, such as Nikki Cook, Josh Neufeld, and Leland Purvis, are currently working on projects which in large parts came from their ACT-I-VATE work."@en ;

dbr:Botellita_de_Jerez	rdf:type	dbo:Band ;
	dbo:abstract	"Botellita de Jerez was a Mexican rock band, formed in Mexico City in 1982. Their music is a fusion of rock, cumbia, and Mexican traditional music like mariachi and son, creating the genre called guacarrock (rock and guacamole). The band was always distinguished by a festive and irreverent musical fusion, celebrating the culture of the nacos and integrating sketches and albures in its lyrics and concerts. Its style, standard rock, was combined with satirical lyrics that portrayed urban life and popular culture in Mexico City. In their song \"Guaca Rock de la Malinche\", they coined the phrase Todo lo naco es chido (Everything tacky is cool), trying to re-vindicate the popular culture of the lower socio-economic classes. Botellita de Jerez pioneered a lot of trends from contemporary art in Mexico and the United States, since it incorporated motifs from popular use, such as lucha libre, popular dances and slang, which are now commonly used among the upper classes as well. The name of the band comes from a Mexican saying used as rebuttal in an argument: \"Botellita de jerez, todo lo que me digas, ser\u00E1 al rev\u00E9s\", which literally means: \"Bottle of sherry, all you say to me will be otherwise\" However, the equivalent English idiom is: \"I'm rubber, you're glue, whatever you say bounces off me and sticks to you.\" One of their most notable songs is \"Ni\u00F1a de mis ojos\" included in the LP of the same name, which has been released on the albums \"El Ultimo Guacarrock\" and \"Superespecial Un Plug\". The signature songs of Botellita de Jerez are \"Guacarrock\", \"El Guaca Rock de la Malinche\", \"Alarmala de Tos\", \"Oh Denny's\" and \"Abuelita de Batman\" (The Granny of Batman) which became the first cumbia-rock of the rock band, the song is notable for its parody-music video filmed in Colonia Santa Mar\u00EDa la Ribera in Mexico City."@en ;

The duo became popular through the internet with the song B\u00E6rumsgrammatikk in 2004 and later with Putt Diamanter Opp in 2006. In 2007, they finished their first album, Gull og Gr\u00F8nne Skoger, and followed that with their second album Verden Vil Bedras in early 2008. Their popularity grew even further after the release of their second album, first through the single Dra Tilbake which was released nearing the end of 2007, and more so after the release of Det E'kke Meg Det Er Deg in the middle of 2008. Record sales, lots of airplay on many of Norway's radio stations, and frequent performances pushed them to become one of Norway's most popular artists in rap and hip hop."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"The Gay Men\u2019s Chorus of Washington, D.C. (GMCW), is one of the oldest LGBT choral organizations in the United States. With more than 300 singing members, it is also one of the largest. The chorus\u2019 stated mission is that it \u201Cdelights audiences and champions gay equality with robust artistry, fun, and surprise.\u201D In addition to singing members, GMCW has nearly 100 support volunteers, 400 subscribers, 500 donors and an annual audience of nearly 10,000. The parent organization is the Federal City Performing Arts Association, Inc., and GMCW is a member of GALA Choruses. The chorus was established in 1981 by enthusiasts of the San Francisco Gay Men\u2019s Chorus who attended a local performance at the Kennedy Center Concert Hall. In the time since its founding, GMCW has performed locally at the Kennedy Center, the National Theatre, the Warner Theatre, DAR Constitution Hall, the Lincoln Theatre and, most frequently, Lisner Auditorium at George Washington University. The chorus performed at President Clinton\u2019s second inauguration in 1997. In 1998, the chorus toured three Scandinavian capitals. While there, GMCW was received by Sweden\u2019s Princess Christina to thank members for singing in support of Noah\u2019s Ark, a Swedish AIDS services organization. During its 20th-anniversary season in 2000\u20132001, GMCW performed at Carnegie Hall and Boston\u2019s Symphony Hall in joint concerts with the gay men\u2019s choruses of Boston and New York City. In December 2002, GMCW performed as part of the televised 25th annual Kennedy Center Honors in tribute to Elizabeth Taylor. The chorus has commissioned original works for men\u2019s chorus, such as Changing Hearts in 2004 and Songs of My Family in 2007. Both works were featured on CD releases subsequent to their inaugural performances on stage. GMCW performs three subscription concerts annually: holiday-themed (December), spring (March) and summer (June), which opens Washington\u2019s annual week-long Capital Pride celebration. In addition, in 2007 and 2008, the chorus performed a non-subscription concert of classical fare in February, between the holiday and spring concerts. There are occasional smaller, also non-subscription productions, such as an auditioned Cabaret concert in October or November. The chorus makes appearances at local community events, including programs for PFLAG, Whitman-Walker Clinic and the Human Rights Campaign. The chorus sponsors two small ensembles: Potomac Fever, an a cappella close-harmony group, and Rock Creek Singers, a chamber choir. These ensembles serve as representatives of the larger chorus at community functions, and each produces an annual concert. The records of the GMCW are cared for by the Special Collections Research Center in the Estelle and Melvin Gelman Library of the George Washington University."@en ;

The group was conceived by record producer Igor Matviyenko, and initially consisted of Andrei Grigoriev-Apollonov, Kirill Andreev, and primary vocalist Igor Sorin. They performed under several names (such as \"Apollo-Soyuz\") before settling on \"Ivanushki International\", a name meant to represent their intended blend of Russian (\"Little Ivans\") and international influences, and itself written half in Cyrillic, half in the Latin alphabet, with the second word read as in English. Their debut album, \u041A\u043E\u043D\u0435\u0447\u043D\u043E \u043E\u043D (Konyechno on, Of Course It's Him), was released in 1996. It included three cover versions of songs from the 1980s \u2013 \"\u0412\u0441\u0435\u043B\u0435\u043D\u043D\u0430\u044F\" (Vselennaya, \"The Universe\"), originally performed by Alexander Ivanov, and \"\u0420\u043E\u043D\u0434\u043E\" (Rondo, \"Roundabout\"), \"\u042D\u0442\u0430\u0436\u0438\" (Etazhi, \"Levels\"), and \"\u041C\u0430\u043B\u0438\u043D\u0430\" (\"Malina\", \"Rasberry\") by the group Class. However, it contained several original songs, including the hits \"\u0422\u0443\u0447\u0438\" (Tuchi, \"Clouds\"), \"\u041A\u043E\u043B\u0435\u0447\u043A\u043E\" (Kolechko, \"The Ring\"), \"\u0413\u0434\u0435-\u0442\u043E\" (Gdye-to, \"Somewhere\"), and \"\u041E\u043D\u0430\" (Ona, \"She\"). A remixed version of the album followed one year later, Konyechno on remixed. The remixes were created by Lubeh keyboardist Igor Polonsky, Moral Code X keyboardist Konstantin Smirnov, and DJ Maxim Milyutenko. Alongside the remixed versions, the album contained the new hit \"\u041A\u0443\u043A\u043B\u0430\" (Kukla, \"Doll\") and a cover version of the Lubeh song \"\u0414\u0443\u0441\u044F\" (Dusya). Ivanushki's second studio album, \u0422\u0432\u043E\u0438 \u043F\u0438\u0441\u044C\u043C\u0430 (Tvoi pisma, Your Letters), released later in 1997, repeated the existing formula of original material and covers of past hits. It also included an audio letter from the group. Later that year, Igor Sorin left to pursue a solo career, and was replaced by Oleg Yakovlev, who had appeared in the music video for \"Doll\". Without Sorin, the group continued its string of successes, releasing its perhaps best known song \"\u0422\u043E\u043F\u043E\u043B\u0438\u043D\u044B\u0439 \u043F\u0443\u0445\" (Topoliny pukh, \"Poplar Fuzz\"), a number-one hit in the summer of 1998. On September 1, 1998, Sorin committed suicide, jumping from the window of his high-rise apartment, and died three days later. The following year, the group released \u0424\u0440\u0430\u0433\u043C\u0435\u043D\u0442\u044B \u0436\u0438\u0437\u043D\u0438 (Fragmenti iz zhizni, Fragments of Life), their tribute to him, which contained songs he had written prior to joining Ivanushki, as well as poems he had written, and a song dedicated to him, \"\u042F \u0442\u0435\u0431\u044F \u043D\u0438\u043A\u043E\u0433\u0434\u0430 \u043D\u0435 \u0437\u0430\u0431\u0443\u0434\u0443\" (Ya tyebya nikogda nye zabudu, \"I Will Never Forget You\"). Ivanushki released their first full album with Yakovlev as vocalist, \u041E\u0431 \u044D\u0442\u043E\u043C \u044F \u0431\u0443\u0434\u0443 \u043A\u0440\u0438\u0447\u0430\u0442\u044C \u0432\u0441\u044E \u043D\u043E\u0447\u044C (Ob etom ya budu krichat' vsyu noch, I'll Shout About This All Night ), in April 1999.

They also collaborated with the Rock Creek Singers of the Gay Men's Chorus of Washington DC to present the Durufl\u00E9 Messe Cum Jubilo. The 2010 - 2011 season was the Chorale's Fifth Anniversary season, during which the Chorale had its European debut, performing the European premiere of Paul Leavitt: Requime at \u00C9glise Saint-Sulpice. The Chorale also performed at St. Patrick's Cathedral in December 2010. The New York City Master Chorale also has a commitment to providing outreach to New York City\u2019s public schools and community. In addition to engaging community members through its regular concerts, Dr. Kano and the singers visit low-income public schools, exposing more than 400 students per year to choral music. These classroom lessons include conversations with students about the value and role of classical music and providing them with complimentary tickets to the chorale\u2019s concerts. The majority of the students who partake in the program and who attend the concerts have had little to no exposure to classical music. Additionally, the Chorale performs free concerts at area churches to bring the experience of classical music to local communities. NYCMC is the only New York City area chorus with such outreach programs in its schools and community."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Folk Face were a comedy band formed in 2005 by BBC Radio 1 DJ Dave Vitty and BBC Newsreader Dominic Byrne. Mainly appearing on The Chris Moyles Show, they also appeared in person at the Glastonbury Festival and at several Radio 1 events. They mainly did cover versions in a tongue-in-cheek folk music style. They appeared at the Glastonbury Festival in 2005, but disbanded soon after, only re-forming for a one-off on 20 June 2007 for The Chris Moyles Show to give away tickets for the Glastonbury Festival 2007. Byrne played guitar for the band, however Vitty played different instruments, these being the bongos in 2005 and the nose flute in 2007. They auditioned for Dave Grohl on 6 July 2007, while Grohl was in London for Live Earth, in the hope of securing a warm up slot at one of the Foo Fighters future gigs. Grohl was reminded of this and asked to consider it while on air on Radio 1 on the 22 November 2007, however no confirmation of an offer for supporting the band, this time for the Radio 1 Foo Fighters Gig at Wembley on 7 June 2008, was made. Folk Face also played live on 15 February 2008, at Mote Park in Kent, when Radio 1 announced that their One Big Weekend would be coming from Maidstone, also playing the actual event on 10 May 2008. Folk Face were mistaken for band Scouting for Girls who also played live at the launch, in the BBC's in-house magazine Ariel. Folk Face auditioned for Sir Andrew Lloyd Webber, for a chance to represent the UK at the 2009 Eurovision Song Contest. Folk Face failed to impress Lloyd Webber, who commented that the lyrics could have upset Russia among other countries. More recently, Folk Face played a song at the 2009 Big Weekend in Swindon, as part of the breakfast show team's set of song parodies. They also toured the UK for the first time through August and September 2010. On 11 April 2011, they announced on The Chris Moyles Show that Folk Face would play Glastonbury Festival 2011. On 10 January 2013 Dominic Byrne tweeted that it was a \"sad day today with the news that Folkface are no more.\" However, he did state that there was the possibility that the band could re-form for a farewell show in the summer."@en ;

dbr:Psihomodo_Pop	rdf:type	dbo:Band ;
	dbo:abstract	"Psihomodo Pop is a Croatian pop punk group. The band was formed in 1983 in Zagreb and has since achieved a somewhat cult following across the area of former Yugoslavia. Formed from the remnants of a band called Neron, Psihomodo Pop initially gained fame across former Yugoslavia in 1988 after the release of their debut album Godina zmaja (The Year of the Dragon). Nema nje was released as a single from the album and became a success due to the music video for the song being played by MTV. This gave Psihomodo Pop the distinction as the first Yugoslavian music act to have their music played on a major music television network. In 1990 the band released their second studio album Sexy magazin and set out on a relatively successful three-month tour across the former Soviet Union. That same year, for concerts in Ljubljana and Zagreb, the band was chosen as the opening act for The Ramones, a band that Psihomodo Pop cited as both a musical act they admire the most as well as their biggest influence. Late 1990 saw Psihomodo Pop abandon their plans for an extended tour in support of their new album due to the outbreak of hostilities leading up to the Croatian War of Independence. The band joined Hrvatski Band Aid (Croatian Band Aid), a project composed of many of Croatia's top music acts, to help create the patriotic song Moja Domovina (My Homeland) condemning the war. After the war and the breakup of Yugoslavia, the band continued their success in Croatia by releasing several commercially and critically acclaimed albums such as Srebrne svinje (Silver Pigs), which spawned the Porin award winning single Starfucker. In 2000, the band released Debakl (Debacle) which won another Porin, this time for Best Rock Album of the Year. The band's eighth and the most recent studio album is Jeee! Jeee! Jeee!, released in 2009."@en ;

Later that year they won the Studio Brussel Demopoll with The Future Of The Sun.In 2007 they teamed up with Len Lemeire (from Implant/32Crash fame) to record their first album Creationism.2008 saw the signing to the Alfa Matrix record label and the release of a new album, featurings and remixes. After the release of their album Entertainment Industries in 2008 Psy'Aviah performed on festivals such as BIMFest 2008, Waregem Expo Gothic Festival 2009, VK Concerts (support Subsonica), Hof Ter Lo (support Emilie Autumn), etc.. The Psy'Aviah videoclip for their single \"Moments (feat. Suzi Q. Smith)\" got banned in 2009 by YouTube which spawned a reaction of disbelief and disapproval towards YouTube in both the press and in online communities. 2010 brought the third album of Psy'Aviah entitled Eclectric, produced by band member Yves Schelpe and mastered by Geert de Wilde of IC 434 in Antwerp. Their third album contained a mix of electric eclecticism, showcasing varying styles while retaining a constant hint of darkness. They invited guests such as Jean-Luc De Meyer of Front 242 fame to sing on the track Oph\u00E9lie, and Jennifer Parkin of Ayria who guested on the track Into The Game. The album Introspection / Extrospection is the band's latest and was released November 25, 2011. It again features a wild range of styles as on Eclectric, and includes a track with Swedish model and ex-Ashbury Heights singer Kari Berg, Dutch singer Lis van den Akker from Dutch act Misery as well as Belgian MC's MC D\u00E9\u00E9joohc\u00E9\u00E9 & Thomas C. Beerten. The album is their third to be released on Alfa Matrix records. The first single Ok (including the remix by M.I.K.E.) and the track SOS Overdose attracted a great deal of attention before the album was actually released. In 2012 A follow up to the album Introspection / Extrospection was released in the form of a DJ-EP Ok / Virtual Gods DJEP with remixes by NUDE, Jan Vervloet. The EP included a cappella versions and dub version of the songs. Before the release the Jan Vervloet remix of the track Ok leaked out and was already being played in various dj sets and podcasts, among others in the one by Johan Gielen. Concertwise the band play at venues Nijdrop for the Pluto Festival and at Ancienne Belgique as support for Praga Khan. The year 2013 brought the band to the classic venues Nijdrop for the audio visual Pluto Festival and at Ancienne Belgique as support for Praga Khan's special 25-year anniversary concert. Meanwhile they've also released the Future Past Mini Album / EP which featured guest vocals by Kyoko Baertsoen, the founder of act Lunascape (band) and former member of Hooverphonic. The Future Past mini album spawned two music videos for the tracks \"Circles\" and \"Letting Go\", the latter one hand-drawn, animated and directed by Emily Weeks. 2014 saw Psy'Aviah return to its core, with founder and producer Yves Schelpe writing and producing the tracks for the album The Xenogamous Endeavour.

Its members describe their music as \"nihilist suicide pop\", although elements of neoclassical and rock music, melancholic folk, as well as tango are prevalent, along with a recurring experimental feel. From dark, wailing experimental folk in the beginning, the sound began to transform and grow, to where it is now compared to the work of Nick Cave, Swans, and Scott Walker. The group's work has been described as crossing a wide variety of genres and musical styles or traditions, and the band itself is considered highly unique among the modern neofolk and post-industrial scenes in Europe. The ingenuity and constructiveness of Spiritual Front's songs have gained them somewhat of a cult following since their formation in the late 1990s. The band originated in 1999 as a project fronted by Simone \"Hellvis\" Salvatori, a guitarist and singer from Italy. They have since worked extensively \u2014 both solo and with several other projects\u2014 on their musical output. The group has performed subsequent tours throughout Europe, eastern Europe and South America. Their song, The Gift of Life, appeared on the original score of the American slasher film Saw II, Jesus died in Las Vegas appeared in the American Television series 'Las Vegas'. Their music is also frequently used for theater pieces, modern ballets and shorts.

	dbo:abstract	"To Live and Shave in L.A. (TLASILA) is an experimental music collective founded in 1993 by avant-garde composer/producer Tom Smith (formerly of Washington, DC groups Peach of Immortality and Pussy Galore) and Miami Beach musician/producer Frank \"Rat Bastard\" Falestra. They were soon joined by oscillator player Ben Wolcott; this lineup created the majority of the releases in TLASILA's extensive discography. Its debut album, 30-minuten m\u00E4nnercreme, was released in 1994. Bananafish Magazine described the recording as \"a wind tunnel of 30-weight vitriol.\" The \"wildly inaccessible\" ensemble has featured Don Fleming, Andrew W.K., Weasel Walter, Thurston Moore, and at least a dozen other musicians and sound artists. The group's primary aesthetic assertion posits that genre is \"obsolete\". Although often categorized as purveyors of noise music, TLASILA have been noted to pursue an unorthodox approach, \"construct(ing) songs around an overwhelming plethora of sonic detail, challenging the listener to engage with a surfeit of information,\" deliberately blurring \"the line between harsh metal-on-metal noise and abstract musique concr\u00E8te.\" Smith's lyrics \"distance\" the group \"from any potential peers,\" \"scanning like (they) came from some previously unearthed hermetic treatise.\" Its final album, The Cort\u00E8ge, was released Fan Death Records in 2011."@en ;

dbr:Porno_para_Ricardo	rdf:type	dbo:Band ;
	dbo:abstract	"Porno para Ricardo (English: Porn for Richard) is a Cuban rock band founded in 1998. It is considered to be one of the most visible examples of young Cubans disagreement with the Castro's rule. Their lyrics are mostly about politics and contemporary Cuban society, and are harshly critical of the Cuban government. Their lyrics are frequently very explicit and strongly critical of Castro. The band was originally well received by the Cuban cultural scene. However in 2003 Gorki \u00C1guila, the leader of the band, was arrested under drugs charges at a music festival in Pinar del Rio. He was imprisoned for 4 years only to be released after serving 2 years in prison. After his release, his lyrics became increasingly political. In March 2004 Gorki was nominated for the British Index on Censorship prize in the category \"Music\". The critical stance of the group against the regime accelerated only to be prohibited and their website cancelled the same year. In August 2008 \u00C1guila was arrested by the Cuban police with the charge of dangerousness, which allows them to detain people whom they think they are likely to commit crimes. The charge carries a penalty of up to four years in prison. He was eventually ordered to pay a $30 fine (2 months salary) for the lesser offense of public disorder which he paid after some hesitation in coins, after prosecutors dropped the more serious charge following intense international pressure after broad media coverage. This is an unprecedented event in Cuban jurisprudence; the communist government is usually strict about punishment given to independent journalists and other dissident voices. The group organizes a small recording studio for other prohibited groups that cannot play in Cuba called Paja Recolds."@en ;

dbr:The_Fixations	rdf:type	dbo:Band ;
	dbo:abstract	"The Fixations were a mod revival band from North London that formed in 1978. An early incarnation of the band, including Ken Gamby (drums), Paul Cathcart (vocals, lead guitar), Paul Cattini (vocals, rhythm guitar) and Noel Hughes (bass) started in summer 1976. The line-up changed in 1978 with Richard Sharp joining the band on rhythm guitar. Later Cathcart switched to lead guitar and taught Richard bass guitar, and gigs were lined up by November 1978, making them one of the first bands in the mod revival scene, and gaining a very early mention in Sounds. They played at venues such as Dingwalls, The Marquee Club, Club 100, The Music Machine and Pied Bull, where they held a residency. They toured all over England with The Chords, Teenbeats, Purple Hearts, The Scooters, The Killermeters and other mod revivalists. Unlike many of the mod revival bands, they did not play any cover versions. Lyrically, they tackled a range of subjects, and a number of their songs covered attitudes to the work environment. Their management turned down a number of record deals, so no vinyl records exist by this band, despite recording a double A side (\"No Way Out\"/\"Clever Remarks\") with Larry Wallace for Carerre. Detour Records has released The Sound Of Young London, and a book has been written by their drummer called The Fixations Modest Recognition. Written by Ken Gamby and Paul Cattini, the book chronicles the history of the band."@en ;
