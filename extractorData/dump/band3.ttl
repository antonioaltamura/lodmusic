	dbo:abstract	"Blue Merle was an American band centered in Nashville, Tennessee. Their name comes from the lyrics of a Led Zeppelin song, Bron-Y-Aur Stomp from Led Zeppelin III, referring to a \"blue-eyed merle\" border collie dog. Their lead singer Luke Reynolds, has a voice that has been compared to those of Chris Martin and Dave Matthews. The band is also known for live renditions of the Talking Heads song Psycho Killer. The band was first formed when Luke Reynolds and Jason Oettel met and began to work together. A friend in a studio offered them some recording time, and they began recording several demo tracks. While they were doing so, the President of Sony Publishing happened to be there, and offered them a contract. While they passed on it, it was a start. Reynolds then met Beau Stapleton, a Mandolin player, on his way back to his home in Vermont and invited him to join. Oettel brought one of his own friends, William Ellis, a drummer into the band as well. It was William who came up with the band's name. The last member to join was Luke Bulla, a fiddle player, who had been asked to fill in for a couple weeks, and soon was a full-time member. In February 2005, Blue Merle released Burning In The Sun, which features the singles \"Burning In The Sun\", \"Every Ship Must Sail Away\", and \"Lucky To Know You\". The album hit #8 on the Billboard Heatseekers chart and peaked at #199 on the Billboard 200. Blue Merle played Lollapalooza in 2005, and toured with Guster, Jem, J.J. Cale, and Badly Drawn Boy. In April 2006, the band broke up. They played their last show, 45 minute set, on Friday, April 21 at Vanderbilt University's Rites of Spring music festival along with Clap Your Hands Say Yeah and My Morning Jacket. Since the band's breakup, Luke Reynolds released two solo EPs entitled The Space Between the Lines and Maps. Beau Stapleton also released a solo EP, Will I Shine For You Still. Luke Reynolds's latest project, Pictures and Sound, released their self-titled debut album August 19, 2008 on Vanguard Records. In August 2008, NBC used Blue Merle's song \"Burning in the Sun\" during a feature on the Women's Pole Vault during the Beijing Olympics. The song \"If I Could\" was also prominently featured in the Friday Night Lights episode \"Let's Get It On\" (first aired Nov 2 2007). \"Every Ship Must Sail Away\" was the final song in Season 1, Episode 2 of the TV series \"Bones\"."@en ;

Over the band's three decades of existence, they have made numerous shifts in style and presentation, resulting in an overall shift from initial post-punk and Industrial Records influence to a more acoustic and folk music-oriented approach. They are sometimes considered controversial (largely due to usage of themes and imagery relating to Nazi Germany).

It was founded by Alejandro Mill\u00E1n and Marcela Bovio in 2001 following the leaving of their previous band, Hydra. The band's line-up was extended in 2003 for purposes of a major music festival held in Monterrey, Mexico with Roberto Quintanilla on lead guitar, Pablo Gonz\u00E1lez on bass guitar and Javier Garagarza on drums. By the end of the year, Elfon\u00EDa independently produced their self-titled first studio album which marked their breakthrough into mainstream music. In November 2003, Marcela was invited by Arjen Anthony Lucassen to perform vocals on Ayreon's album The Human Equation. Two years later the band released their second studio album, This Sonic Landscape, a fusion of many music genres, including progressive rock, jazz, ambient music and goth rock. Shortly afterwards, Elfon\u00EDa went on a successful tour around Mexico in order to promote their newest effort. The band split up in December 2006. Bovio and Mill\u00E1n continued in Stream of Passion with Lucassen."@en ;

Shortly before the release of the band's 2009 release, This is IT, Zak St. John replaced Aaron Revivo on drums although the album cover still features Aaron presumptively since Aaron's departure was near to the release date. In Theory's music is centered on energetic punk drum beats, thick distorted guitars and pop-flavored melodies. During their first incarnation, the group issued a debut self-titled CD in 2005 titled 'We're Better Live'. The CD featured twelve live studio songs. In 2009 band recorded their debut studio album This is It, which was produced by platinum producer Barry Fasman (Air Supply, The Kids from \"Fame\", Melissa Manchester, Diana Ross). This is It continued in a similar vein and got mixed reviews from critics. The band was both hailed and criticized for its youthful themes and content, such as 'Love Me or Leave Me', a song inspired by episodes of The OC. The band was the first and remains to be one of few bands in the world to be sponsored by the exclusive guitar manufacture RKS Guitars. Other artists sponsored by RKS Guitars include Dave Mason, Rick Springfield, Keith Richards and Ron Wood (currently of Rolling Stones), and Moby.The band was also represented by the TKO organization. The band played their final show on August 21, 2009 at Hollywood's Key Club, in California. As of the present the band has never officially acknowledged that they officially broke up or went on hiatus.

	dbo:abstract	"Last Falling is an American rock band fronted by multi-intstrumentalist, Bryan Ferguson. The original lineup formed in 1998 under the name \"The Accelerators\", revising the band name later in 2003. According to Ferguson, Last Falling has become more of a reflection of himself, being the youngest of four siblings by eleven years. The first homemade CD of 3 songs entitled 3 Song EP was released in 2003, featuring songs written while under the previous band name. It was self-produced and circulated at local shows for free with a limited amount of copies. A year later in 2004 came a 4 song EP entitled And The Tree Was Happy. The album featured hit song \"Heroine No. 1 \"and was recorded and produced by Bryan's brother, Daniel Ferguson, in the childhood home at which Ferguson resided. In 2005, Last Falling recorded In Loving Memory at Sound Image in Van Nuys, CA. This proved to be the only album that was recorded in a professional studio next to legendary Sound City Studios, which Dave Grohl helped make a documentary for in 2013. After mild success over the years, the band hit a falling out in 2008 as Ferguson stepped back to focus on his personal life and family. The passing of Ferguson's father in February 2016 - notable \"Boss Jock\" and National Radio Hall of Fame personality, Charlie Tuna - sent Ferguson back into the studio to pursue his passion for music once again. A self-titled album is due out Winter 2016."@en ;

The core group comsisted of Chris Dreja, Paul Samwell-Smith, and Jim McCarty. Vocals on their eponymous album were done by John Fiddler, formerly of Medicine Head and British Lions; on the second album Fiddler sang on five tracks with guests including Graham Parker, Ian Dury and Roger Chapman singing lead on the others. Many musicians guested on their albums (including Rory Gallagher, Earl Slick and Mark Feltham), with several tracks featuring Steve Hackett. Former Yardbirds guitarists Jeff Beck and Jimmy Page guested on their first and second albums respectively. The group formation and name were explained on the sticker affixed to original LP releases: \"On June 23, 1983, as part of London's historic Marquee Club's 25th Anniversary celebrations, three original Yardbirds -- Paul Samwell-Smith, Chris Dreja and Jim McCarty -- found themselves together on stage again. This same venue had been a regular nightspot for the legendary guitar-based blues-rock band that was the springboard for the likes of Clapton, Beck and Page.For Paul, Chris and Jim, the reunion made them realize they had to make more music in the Yardbirds' tradition. They added Medicine Head John Fiddler on vocals to form the nucleus of the band.On Christmas Eve 1983, Jeff Beck joined them at a recording session at a farmhouse south of London and added his unique touch to four of the tracks. As other old friends jumped into the sessions the idea for the group's new name came about. Now with a fresh spirit and basic rock and roll roots there is a new band from across the pond.\" The group showed promise on the first album of rock radio friendly tunes, featuring Jeff Beck. \"Back Where I Started\" was in the top ten in the U.S., and the album was a featured number one on college campuses. Plans were made for a U.S. tour, but it is alleged that Samwell-Smith, Dreja, and McCarty nixed the idea of the tour, much to John Fiddler's dismay. Jeff Beck, who along with Dzal Martin was considered as the lead guitarist for such a tour, was reportedly disgusted at his ex-bandmates' refusal to tour America. He took no part on the second album, \"Strange Land\" (1986) and Fiddler barely chose to do so before walking out. \"Asylum\" is one of the few songs Fiddler sang on, and was the only one featuring Page. The track Back Where I Started is regularly included in the set-list of the revived Yardbirds."@en ;

At first, P\u0113rkons played two completely different kinds of music \u2013 instrumental classical music, and wild rock'n'roll bordering on hard rock. The band is better known for the latter. Their songs became the folklore of the youth, speaking about things nobody else dared to speak about. The band was for no expressed reason banned by the Soviet power in 1983. They continued to play as an ensemble of the kolkhoz \"Soviet Latvia\", careful not to mention the title P\u0113rkons again. In 1985, after a concert in Ogre, a group of teenagers demolished two train compartments. After this, the group was banned again immediately, even though it had nothing to do with the incident. (The concert, demolished train, and court trials were documented by Juris Podnieks in the film, Vai viegli b\u016Bt jaunam? (Is It Easy to Be Young). After a few more years, in 1987, they arrived to the song festival Liep\u0101jas dzintars (English: Amber of Liep\u0101ja) as the ensemble of the fishermen's kolkhoz \"Selga\". The texts of their music are at least as rebellious as the music itself, mostly written by M\u0101ris Melgalvs, one of the best known examples is Bal\u0101de par gulbi.

	dbo:abstract	"3Deep were a soul-pop music boy band composed of American actors Eddie Cibrian (Sunset Beach, Third Watch) and Joshua Morrow (The Young and the Restless), and Canadian singer CJ Huyer. Their success was mostly limited to Canada, Europe and Asia. Their record label did not release their debut album in the United States. Their first album Yes Yes Yes...No No No was released in 1999 and featured their biggest hit, the single \"Into You\", a top-10 hit on the Canadian charts. Their second album Can't Get Over You was released in 2001. Among the artists they collaborated with was Michie Mee on a track from their first album and with Howie Dorough on a track from their second. Although 3Deep were largely unknown in the US (despite Cibrian and Morrow's acting success), they were one of the more successful Canadian boy bands of the era, with a sizeable and young female fan base. Upon their release of their debut album, Cibrian and Morrow had already had a built-in fan base due to their success on US soap operas and their good looks. During their time together, in addition to touring, the group performed at events such as Ottawa's Winterlude and appeared at the Juno Awards and at the MuchMusic studios."@en ;

To date Pleasant has released four full-length albums under this name, as well as four 7\" singles, a cd-r of live recordings, and a cassette EP titled Notes From Undersound. His album Conscious of Conscience (2006) marks his first true solo full-length, drawing on assistance from no outside collaborators. Early in 2007, Pleasant announced that what had begun as a solo project would expand into a four-piece band, geared towards a poppier, more guitar driven sound. The band now features Pleasant (vocals and guitar), Nathan Matthews (bass), Lee-Ann Sheel (drums), and Shinobu Hata (keyboards)."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Air Traffic Control is a power pop/rock band hailing from Nova Scotia's South Shore, not to be confused with the separate Boston based Air Traffic Controller. The band has a history that predates even its current name. Brothers Kirk and Jordi Comstock made their first foray into music while in elementary school. By 1991, both were playing all-ages shows in and around their hometown of Lunenburg, Nova Scotia and it was only a matter of time before they would plant the seed of what would eventually become one of the Maritimes' biggest cult followings. Originally founded under the Madhat moniker, they recruited a bassist (one of nearly a half-dozen who would come and go until 2005) and released the independent EP Freak in 1993. This received the attention of local radio station CKBW who would feature the trio prominently through local programming bringing Madhat to a wider audience. 1995 would bring about Hardhitters, the band's second EP followed by Full Length in 1998, the boys' first full-length effort. The critical success of the latter elevated Madhat to a national audience. In 2005, Madhat renamed themselves Air Traffic Control. They released a new self-titled album on February 12, 2005 to critical acclaim and garnering a nomination for New Group of the Year at the Nova Scotia Music Week conference. The trio's opening track, 'Feel Proud' was selected as the title song for the Electronic Arts game Rugby 2005 and has been featured in the YTV series 15 Love, while 'People Watching' is featured in EA Sports' NHL 17."@en ;

To date, the band has released sixteen studio albums, and has been cited as having influenced many notable heavy metal groups, including Megadeth, Slayer, Anthrax and Metallica. The band, in particular Kudlow and Reiner, was the subject of the 2008 documentary film, Anvil! The Story of Anvil, directed by the screenwriter and former Anvil roadie, Sacha Gervasi. Upon its release, the film garnered critical acclaim from many major publications, and has since brought the band renewed recognition, including opening slots with AC/DC and Saxon. Appearances at both major heavy metal festivals, including Download, Loud Park and Hellfest, and independent music festivals like Bumbershoot and SXSW, also followed the release of the film. Reviewers described Anvil as a pioneering hair metal band that was popular in the 1980s but then faded into obscurity in the 1990s, while refusing to stop playing, recording and gigging. Anvil's antics on and off stage, the setbacks they suffered, and their determination to keep going was compared to the fictional band Spinal Tap."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Entheogenic is a musical project consisting of Piers Oak-Rhind and Helmut Glavar that crosses musical style boundaries. Since the early 1980s, the Austrian musician and songwriter Helmut Glavar has founded a variety of bands, ranging from punk and funk to new wave and drums-and-bass. Piers Oak-Rhind was born in England and has been a sound designer, programmer and musician since the early 1990s. He studied guitar at the London School of Guitar. According to the two members, the music mixes \"coloristic electrophonics\" with \"impressionistic orchestra-like sound\". The use of both eastern and western vocals, tribal-sounding instruments, and an array of synthesizers built the foundation of the Entheogenic sound. According to some people, Entheogenic was one of the two major psybient projects (the other being Shpongle) whose experimentation influenced the psychedelic electronic scene. Entheogenic's first release Entheogenic is a concept album that recounts the tale of an Ayahuasca journey, with layered trance melodies and texturally rich arrangements. Three labels bid for the release: the former UK-based Flying Rhino, the German-based Cosmophilia and the Spanish 3D Vision. The album was released on 3D Vision Records. In 2003, their second album Spontaneous Illumination, released on c.o.r.n. recordings, was the first psy-chill album ever to make it to number 1 in the German chill-out charts. Their first two albums were noted for their epic thematic lengthy tunes. Both albums feature the work of sound engineer Glenn Schick (Morcheeba, Ludacris etc.) In 2005, Dialogue of the Speakers (Chillcode Records) continued the success of its predecessor, and went straight to number 1 in the German charts, where it remained for 24 weeks. Golden Cap (Chillcode Records) was released in 2006 and was received by their then quite large following with a love-hate attitude."@en ;

Since its inception, the band's line-up has comprised Eddie Vedder (lead vocals), Mike McCready (lead guitar), Stone Gossard (rhythm guitar) and Jeff Ament (bass). The band's fifth member is drummer Matt Cameron (also of Soundgarden), who has been with the band since 1998. Boom Gaspar (piano) has also been a session/touring member with the band since 2002. Drummers Dave Krusen, Matt Chamberlain, Dave Abbruzzese and Jack Irons are former members of the band. Formed after the demise of Gossard and Ament's previous band, Mother Love Bone, Gossard wrote some tunes, and then recruited the other members, eventually contacting Vedder, who wrote the lyrics. Pearl Jam broke into the mainstream with its debut album, Ten, in 1991. One of the key bands in the grunge movement of the early 1990s, over the course of the band's career, its members became noted for their refusal to adhere to traditional music industry practices, including refusing to make proper music videos or give interviews, and engaging in a much-publicized boycott of Ticketmaster. In 2006, Rolling Stone described the band as having \"spent much of the past decade deliberately tearing apart their own fame.\" To date, the band has sold nearly 32 million records in the United States and an estimated 60 million worldwide. Pearl Jam has outlasted and outsold many of its contemporaries from the alternative rock breakthrough of the early 1990s, and is considered one of the most influential bands of that decade. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic referred to Pearl Jam as \"the most popular American rock & roll band of the '90s\". In 2016, Pearl Jam were nominated for induction into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame, in their first year of eligibility."@en ;

Haruichi Shind\u014D originally formed the band with his cousin during high school and named it \"No Score.\" After the band started, Haruichi asked Akihito Okano and Masami \"Tama\" Shiratama to join. The band was so named because none of them could actually read a score when they first started. When they first started the band, Haruichi was the vocalist, but found out that Akihito could sing better, so he gave the vocalist position to Akihito and took over as guitarist instead. This was the foundation of Porno Graffitti. They debuted with the song Apollo in 1999. Their two subsequent CD singles, Saudade and Agehach\u014D, both sold over a million copies in Japan. They are also well known for the song Melissa, which was used as the opening theme of the anime series Fullmetal Alchemist in 2003. They also created the song Hitori no Yoru, used as the second opening theme of the anime series GTO in 2000, and Winding Road, used as the ending theme of the anime series Ayakashi Ayashi in 2006. A cover of their 2000 single Music Hour was featured in a stage of the Nintendo DS rhythm game Moero! Nekketsu Rhythm Damashii Osu! Tatakae! Ouendan 2. Their single Koyoi, Tsuki ga, Miezu Tomo was featured in the third Bleach film, and their single Anima Rossa was featured as the eleventh opening to Bleach. Their single \"2012Spark\" was featured as the main theme song of the movie Gyakuten Saiban. Their single \"Matataku Hoshi no Shita de\" is the second opening theme for the anime Magi: The Labyrinth of Magic. Their single \"Oh! Rival\" is part of the soundtrack for the new Detective Conan film. And their newest single on 2016, \"THE DAY\" will be the opening of the anime My Hero Academia."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"14 Bis is a Brazilian pop-rock band. The band took its name from Santos-Dumont's 14 Bis airplane. The band was formed in 1979 in the state of Minas Gerais, when the members of two bands, O Ter\u00E7o and \"Bendeg\u00F3\" decided to merge. Fl\u00E1vio Venturini and Vermelho, two founding members of 14 Bis, were also members of the Clube da Esquina band. M\u00FAsica popular brasileira is a strong element in many of 14 Bis compositions. The influence of progressive rock and caipira (hillbilly) is evident in many of its compositions, such as in their use of analog keyboards and complex vocal arrangements. The group reached the peak of their success during the 1980s with notable compositions and performance of popular Brazilian songs. Due to the mild, often happy and soothing theme of many of its compositions, the band was quite popular among children."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"7 Seconds of Love are an English ska/2 Tone band, fronted by musician and animator Joel Veitch that writes and plays songs with often nonsensical lyrics. Veitch animates many videos of the band's songs, such as \"Ninja\" and \"First Drink of the Day\". Some songs have had videos directed by guitarist Pat Schulenburg, such as their most recent production \"Twister\". The band regularly tours the United Kingdom. The animations are available on Veitch's website and the band's site. The band's first official single was \"Twister\" as an iTunes exclusive, and they then released \"Love Me Like You Used To\" and \"Ninja\" as a double A-side single. Originally the MP3's of these tunes were available free, but these are new, fully re-recorded versions available for sale. The song \"Soupy George\" has also inspired fans of the band to turn up at gigs wearing soup cans (either real, empty tins of soup or artistic representations) on their heads. The band's debut album, Danger is Dangerous, was released in September 2008. In April 2013, singer Joel Veitch announced on Twitter that the band would no longer be playing live, due to \"kids and moves and stuff\"."@en ;

Roach was born in Newport News, Virginia, but his family moved to his parents ancestral home in Duffield, Virginia when Roach was still very young. As a teenager, Roach reportedly spent a number of months under the tutelage of cult blues guitarist Washboard Williams; however this rumor has never been properly substantiated, and Roach's playing style does not suggest such tutelage. After attending college in Virginia, Roach lived in several different cities on the east coast of the United States before moving to San Francisco. The move to San Francisco was a turning point for Roach's musical career. There he met and befriended musicians like Tom Meshishnik, Todd Sickafoose, Sean Hayes and Noe Venable. The musical impact that these relationships had on Roach can be heard on Dogwood Winter, his first studio album. The album was jointly produced by Meshishnik and Sickafoose, and features Venable on backing vocals on several tracks."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Criteria is an indie rock band from Omaha, Nebraska, formed in 2003 when ex-Cursive founding member Steve Pedersen returned to his hometown after graduating from the Duke University School of Law. He spent six months in a friend's basement where he wrote all ten songs for his new project's debut album. He recruited the help of some old friends, A.J. Mogis (of Presto! Recording Studios and Lullaby for the Working Class) on bass guitar, Aaron Druery on guitar, and Mike Sweeney of Beep Beep on drums. Their first album, En Garde, was released on his previous band's label, Initial Records. Steve Pedersen eventually got a day job as a lawyer, making it hard for the band to go on tour to promote their new album. Initial Records went bankrupt about a year after, leaving Criteria without a label. Saddle Creek Records took their longtime friend in and put out three releases in 2005. The first was a re-release of the overlooked and underrated En Garde, their new single, \"Prevent the World,\" and their second full-length, When We Break. After being moved into Saddle Creek, Pedersen quit his day job to spend full-time making music and touring. Criteria has performed with bands such as Cursive, The Fall of Troy, Thunderbirds Are Now!, Statistics, Poison the Well, Rahim (band), and Minus the Bear. The band performed at the Maha Musical Festival on August 17, 2013 in Omaha, Nebraska. Criteria's most recent performance took place on December 12, 2013 at the Waiting Room Lounge in Omaha, during which Pedersen mentioned the band was working on a new album."@en ;

In 2008, GMS left Spun Records to further concentrate on their own careers and had created in 2009 a new label to release all of their music from their own various bands called Starbox Music. They have sold over 350.000 copies worldwide. Director Tony Scott used GMS tracks in his films Man on Fire, Domino and Unstoppable. GMS won the Psy-Trance award twice (in 2001 and 2009) at the DJ Awards in Ibiza, Spain."@en ;

In the following years, they recorded their \"Brown Bag\" demo, and went out on a few small tours. After a few volatile years which saw several collective moves and incarnations, the group solidified its line-up and relocated to New York City. The current line-up includes Michelle Proffit (vocals), Dave Sanders (guitar, backing vocals), Derek Wimble (bass), and Justin Williams (drums). The band performs a form of hardcore punk, incorporating melodic indie rock style riffs, often in 6/8 time. Michelle Proffit's vocal style consists mostly of screaming and screeching the lyrics. The lyrics lean towards the left-wing side of the political scale. The band recorded its first EP in early 2002 with producer Don Fury. The result, Invasive/Exotic, was released on G7 Welcoming Committee Records in May, 2002. After touring a bit for the record, the band split up that same year. The members were convinced to re-form in late 2003 by the people at G7 Records. Newly reformed with the same lineup, the band began working on songs that would eventually be recorded and released their first full-length album, End States (2005), again on G7 Welcoming Committee Records."@en ;

Current members are: \n*  James Kottak/Jimmy Ratchitt - lead vocals and guitar \n*  Stephanie Smith - lead guitars, backing vocals \n*  Nils Wandrey - bass backing vocals \n*  Francis Ruiz - drums The band describe themselves as \"Cheap Trick meets Green Day, on a bad day\" and their album Therupy certainly continues to build the band's infamy. In early November 1997, KrunK walked away with two awards in the 2nd Annual Rock City News Awards for bands in Los Angeles. The band was named BEST PUNK BAND, and Athena won BEST FEMALE DRUMMER. In the 7th Annual L.A. Music Awards, Athena was nominated for BEST DRUMMER (Males & Females). She was the first female ever nominated in the history of the L.A. Music Awards. In 2006, the band changed its name from KrunK to Kottak, citing the need for a more original name now that \"krunk\" has become a general term."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"The group Los Ca\u00F1oneros is a popular Venezuelan ca\u00F1onero group. It was created to emulate the times and songs of Caracas in 1920. They make their first public appearance in M\u00E9rida, in the Bullfighting Arena of M\u00E9rida November 20, 1982. In Caracas they were an overwhelming success, enlivening parties and private shows. Then came the professionalization by recording several albums, performing on radio and television. They have toured in Spain, Germany, Portugal and the Caribbean countries. The \"ca\u00F1onera music\" is a musical style born in the capital of Venezuela in the early 20th century. It is the first urban musical expression in this country. It has many similarities with the Dixieland developed in New Orleans. The groups that play \"ca\u00F1onera\" music include several Venezuelan rhythms like the venezuelan merengue, a variant of the pasodoble, joropo, and Venezuelan waltz. Currently there are only two groups dedicated to preserving the traditional music of Caracas: Los Anta\u00F1os del Stadium (1946) and Los Ca\u00F1oneros. Their most recent record is Esta es Caracas (2012), a venezuelan merengue featuring some of the most important singers in Venezuela: Cecilia Todd, Horacio Blanco (lead vocal for the ska band Desorden Publico), Rams\u00E9s Meneses a.k.a. McKlopedia, Aristides Barbella (Malanga), Max Pizzolante, Francisco Pacheco and Serenata Guayanesa."@en ;

The band consists of Canadian brothers, Maynard Plant and Blaise Plant, each acting as lead vocalists and guitarists, and two Japanese members: Tax on drums, and Dick on bass. Monkey Majik is signed to Binyl Records, a subsidiary of Avex Records, and are managed by Edwards Entertainment Group. Due to the blend of Eastern and Western pop rock influences, Monkey Majik has often been referred to as a \"hybrid band\". Much of the band's music has been cross-promoted via television programs, commercials, and movies. They were chosen as \u201CGoodwill Ambassadors\u201D for the 80th anniversary of Canada-Japan relations. The band rose to mainstream success after the 2006 success of their singles, \"Fly\", and \"Around the World\", off of the album Thank You, eventually reaching the top Oricon charts and collaborating with major Japanese sensations such as m-flo and SEAMO. As of 2012, they have released seven studio albums, four EP's, three physical live albums, three digital live albums, and three compilation albums, and have certified five singles through the Recording Industry Association of Japan. Since the debut of Monkey Majik, Maynard and Blaise have both simultaneously worked solo ventures into the music industry to much acclaim: Maynard with blanc. and Blaise with The Alphabet Project, of which they have each released two studio albums thus far. They received much acclaim across Japan after their assisting hands-on with clean-up and rescue during the aftermath of the 2011 T\u014Dhoku earthquake and tsunami, which was later documented and broadcast by MTV Japan on a TV special surrounding their work. Since then, Monkey Majik has gained the attention of American rapper and musical entrepreneur, will.i.am, during his world travels sponsored by Intel. Blaise and will.i.am performed a special version of the Monkey Majik song, \"Watching You\", live in Sendai during a private event, during which performance, will.i.am incorporated a freestyle rap. As \"Goodwill Ambassadors\", the band often visits and tours throughout Canada, having performed a special acoustic session in Toronto under this title on February 19, 2012., Blaise has also performed special acoustic live sessions at the Ottawa Japanese \"natsu matsuri\", or summer festival. The band takes Sendai City of Tohoku as the main base."@en ;

They are generally considered to be one of the most important bands in the Portuguese rock scene and have since reached a cult status. Since the start of their career, their live concerts became famous for their intensity and dark mood, due to their signature alternative rock sound and the performance of vocalist Adolfo Lux\u00FAria Canibal (a pseudonym, meaning Adolph Cannibal Lust), known for occasional onstage theatrics and his gravelly voice, half-sung, half-spoken singing style. M\u00E3o Morta's music is quite difficult to categorize as they seem to incorporate a variety of genres; from punk rock, metal, to industrial and experimental. Their sound, combined with Adolfo's lyrics, reflects urban violence, a human search for pleasure, freedom and a critique of contemporary consumerist society, often with sarcastic humour."@en ;

Ever since their first release in 2003 (an EP titled \"Where's The Mouse?!) the band have gone on to be one of the region's top rock acts. In 2008, One Buck Short (affectionately known as OBS) released their debut album \u201CHalal & Loving It\u201D, it produced hits like \u2018Fast Times\u2019, \u2018Kelibat Korupsi\u2019 and \u2018Khayalan Masa\u2019 to name but a few. With producer/arranger Greg Henderson at the helm, it was hailed by many as one of the best locally produced Malaysian rock albums ever. The band went on to open for acts like Fall Out Boy (in Singapore), Panic! At the Disco, My Chemical Romance and Good Charlotte. The band was the only Malaysian act billed for the inaugural SingFest in 2007 and also performed at the very first MTV Asia Awards held in Malaysia. With its high energy shows, it was not long before the band brought their sound to Australia, the Philippines and even China and Macau. In January 2012, the band released their long-awaited second album entitled \u201CKampong Glam\u201D, their sophomore release was their first full Malay album, with first single \u2018Carilah Duit\u2019 leading the charge and offering listeners a taste of what to expect. The 7-track album saw a new-found maturity in their signature punk-rock sound. After a long hiatus, the band announced their return to the scene earlier this year as well as the comeback of Rockaway Festival, the local rock festival the band founded and has been hosting since 2009."@en ;

The group is best known for their eclectic sampling, quirky lyrics, and their contributions to the evolution of the jazz rap and alternative hip hop subgenres. The members are Posdnuos, Dave and Maseo. The three formed the group in high school and caught the attention of producer Prince Paul with a demo tape of the song \"Plug Tunin'\". With its playful wordplay, innovative sampling, and witty skits, the band's debut album, 3 Feet High and Rising, has been called \"a hip hop masterpiece.\" It is the band's biggest commercial success to date, with their subsequent albums selling progressively less, despite receiving high praise from critics. They were influential in the early stages of rapper/actor Mos Def's career, and are a core part of the Spitkicker collective. They are the second longest standing Native Tongues Posse group, after the Jungle Brothers. In 2006, the group won a Grammy for their collaboration with Gorillaz on the single \"Feel Good Inc.\" In early 2015, they announced plans to release a Kickstarter-funded upcoming 9th studio album And the Anonymous Nobody in September 2015; it was released on August 26, 2016. The album tracks are said to be the result of multiple improvised jam sessions. The album also features guest appearances from artists such as Damon Albarn, Little Dragon, David Byrne and 2 Chainz."@en ;

Their hometown is what gave name to the band. Since 1996, they were joined by percussionist Papo Rom\u00E1n, who left the band in 2006 to dedicate time to his family. The band rose to prominence with their eponymous debut album, which was released in 1996. The album was a hit, spawning several hit singles like \"Salimos de Aqu\u00ED\" and \"El Wanab\u00ED\", and turning the band into one of the most popular musical groups in the island at the moment. Fiel a la Vega followed their debut album with four more studio albums, three of which were released independently. Despite not having the support of a multinational record label or wide publicity, after 20 years, the band is still considered by many as \"the most important rock band in the history of Puerto Rico\". In recent years, the band has seen little activity, with its members being involved in personal projects. Singer Auger has been touring the island solo, and with a musician troupe called La Banda Ac\u00FAstica Rodante, while guitarist Laureano has been pursuing a solo career, while also touring the island with fellow guitarist Joel Rodr\u00EDguez.

In 1992, the group moved to the Boston area, where they were joined by second guitarist, Bill Guerra. After releasing Free T.V.s on a Boston area indie label, they were signed by Sony and recorded \"Head to the Ground\" with producer Mike Denneen. It was released on Columbia Records in 1996. The single \"Download (I Will)\" received considerable airplay on North American radio stations, reaching No. 22 on Billboard's Mainstream Rock Tracks chart, and was included (as track 14) on the soundtrack for the film The Cable Guy. The group's first major release ended up being their last with Columbia. This was not at all due to any musical failure\u2014the group's brand of tuneful, post-grunge, melodic rock was truly exceptional and perfectly tailored for radio play-lists, yet the group received little attention from the label despite their song-crafting and high profile support spots with the likes of '90s superstars Stone Temple Pilots. After leaving Columbia in 1997, the band signed to Polydor (U.S.) and was joined by new drummer Mike Piehl. Working with Nick Gatfield (Polydor) and producer Matt Hyde, (Porno for Pyros, Monster Magnet) they recorded their sophomore effort entitled \"Love and Disaster.\" The band recorded and delivered a highly polished rock album at a very precarious time in the music industry. In 1999, immediately following delivery of the album, Universal Music merged with Polygram and thinned their combined rosters. The band was dropped before the record was ever released and the label opted to keep the master recordings even though other labels were eager to sign the band and release the new album. The band dissolved soon thereafter. In 2009, 10 years later, Universal agreed to return the masters to the band and the album was subsequently released online October 2010."@en ;

Former members Matt Tong and Gordon Moakes left the band in 2013 and 2015 respectively. Their brand of music, whilst rooted in rock, retains elements of other genres such as electronica and house music. The band was formed at the 1999 Reading Festival by Okereke and Lissack. They went through a variety of names before settling on Bloc Party in 2003. Moakes joined the band after answering an advert in NME magazine, while Tong was picked via an audition. Bloc Party got their break by giving BBC Radio 1 DJ Steve Lamacq and Franz Ferdinand's lead singer, Alex Kapranos, a copy of their demo \"She's Hearing Voices\". In February 2005, the band released their debut album Silent Alarm. It was critically acclaimed and was named Indie Album of the Year at the 2006 PLUG Awards and NME Album of the year which both honour indie music. That year, the record was also certified platinum in Britain. The band built on this success in 2007 with the release of their second studio album, A Weekend in the City, which reached a peak of number two in the UK Albums Chart and number twelve in the Billboard 200. In August 2008, Bloc Party released their third studio record, Intimacy which entered the UK Albums Chart at number eight and number eighteen on the Billboard 200. The band went on a hiatus in October 2009 to focus on side projects. They reunited in September 2011, and shortly thereafter released their fourth album, Four, which entered the UK Albums Chart at number three. In 2013, Bloc Party released their third EP titled The Nextwave Sessions in August; the band then began an indefinite hiatus to continue with their respective side projects. The band's fifth studio album, Hymns, the first to involve Harris and Bartle, was released on 29 January 2016. Bloc Party have sold over 3 million albums worldwide."@en ;

Cake was formed in 1991 by McCrea, DiFiore, Greg Brown, Frank French and Shon Meckfessel, who soon left and was replaced by Nelson. Following the self-release of its debut album, Motorcade of Generosity, the band was signed to Capricorn Records in 1995 and released its first single, \"Rock 'n' Roll Lifestyle\", which hit number 35 on the Modern Rock Tracks music chart and was featured on MTV's 120 Minutes; French and Nelson then left the band, and were replaced by Todd Roper and Victor Damiani. Cake's second album, 1996's Fashion Nugget, went platinum on the strength of its lead single, \"The Distance\". Following a tour of Europe and the United States, both Brown and Damiani announced they were leaving Cake, which led to speculation about the band's future; McCrea eventually recruited Xan McCurdy to take over on guitar, and persuaded Nelson to return. Prolonging the Magic, the band's third album, was released in 1998 and went platinum, having shipped over one million units; this was followed three years later by Comfort Eagle, the band's first album on Columbia Records, featuring the single \"Short Skirt/Long Jacket\" which hit number 7 on the Modern Rock Tracks chart. Following a series of tours, including several versions of the Unlimited Sunshine Tour, the band released Pressure Chief in 2004, its second and last album on Columbia. After creating its own label, Upbeat Records, the band released Showroom of Compassion in 2011, which became its first album to debut at the top of the Billboard charts, selling 44,000 copies in the first week after release."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Canned Heat is an American rock band formed in Los Angeles in 1965. The group has been noted for its interpretations of blues material and for its efforts to promote interest in this type of music and its original artists. It was launched by two blues enthusiasts, Alan Wilson and Bob Hite, who took the name from Tommy Johnson's 1928 \"Canned Heat Blues\", a song about an alcoholic who had desperately turned to drinking Sterno, generically called \"canned heat\". After appearances at the Monterey and Woodstock festivals at the end of the 1960s, the band acquired worldwide fame with a lineup consisting of Bob Hite (vocals), Alan Wilson (guitar, harmonica and vocals), Henry Vestine and later Harvey Mandel (lead guitar), Larry Taylor (bass), and Adolfo de la Parra (drums). The music and attitude of Canned Heat afforded them a large following and established the band as one of the popular acts of the hippie era. Canned Heat appeared at most major musical events at the end of the 1960s, performing blues standards along with their own material and occasionally indulging in lengthy 'psychedelic' solos. Two of their songs \u2013 \"Going Up the Country\" and \"On the Road Again\" \u2013 became international hits. \"Going Up the Country\" was a remake of the Henry Thomas song \"Bull Doze Blues\", recorded in Louisville, Kentucky, in 1927. \"On the Road Again\" was a cover version of the 1953 Floyd Jones song of the same name, which is reportedly based on the Tommy Johnson song \"Big Road Blues\", recorded in 1928. Since the early 1970s, numerous personnel changes have occurred, although the current lineup includes all three surviving members of the classic lineup: de la Parra (who has remained in the band since first joining in 1967), Mandel, and Taylor. For much of the 1990s and 2000s, de la Parra was the only member from the band's 1960s lineup. He wrote a book about the band's career. Larry Taylor, whose presence in the band has not been steady, is the other surviving member from the earliest lineups. Mandel, Walter Trout and Junior Watson are among the guitarists who gained fame for playing in later editions of the band. British blues pioneer John Mayall found several musicians for his band among former members of Canned Heat."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Culture Club are an English band that were formed in 1981. The band comprised Boy George (lead vocals), Roy Hay (guitar and keyboards), Mikey Craig (bass guitar) and Jon Moss (drums and percussion). Their second album, Colour by Numbers, sold more than 10 million copies worldwide, and the band sold more than 150 million records overall. It has been certified triple platinum in the UK and quadruple platinum in the US. It appeared on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 100 Best Albums of the 1980s and is also included in the book 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die. The band had several international hits with songs such as \"Do You Really Want to Hurt Me\", \"Time (Clock of the Heart)\", \"Church of the Poison Mind\", \"Karma Chameleon\", \"Victims\", \"It's a Miracle\", \"The War Song\", \"Move Away\", and \"I Just Wanna Be Loved\". Boy George's androgynous style of dressing caught the attention of the public and the media. The group, supporters of the synth pop genre, made numerous forays into reggae and showed a strong propensity for the subgenre of ballads. They are considered one of the most representative and influential groups of the 1980s. They have sold more than 150 million records. Ten of their singles reached the US Top 40, where they are associated with the Second British Invasion of British new wave groups that became popular in the US due to the cable music channel MTV. Culture Club's music combines British new wave and American soul with Jamaican reggae and also other styles such as calypso, salsa or country. In 1984, Culture Club won Brit Awards for Best British Group, Best British Single (\"Karma Chameleon\"), and the Grammy Award for Best New Artist. They were nominated the same year for the Grammy Award for Pop Vocal by Group or Duo but the English rock band The Police won the award. The band were also nominated for a Canadian Juno Award for International Album of the Year. In January 1985, Culture Club were nominated for an American Music Award for Favorite Pop/Rock Band/Duo/Group Video Artist, and in September 1985, they were nominated for two MTV Video Music Awards for Best Special Effects and Best Art Direction for their video \"It's a Miracle\".

	dbo:abstract	"Daft Punk are a French electronic music duo formed in 1993 by Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo and Thomas Bangalter. The duo achieved significant popularity in the late 1990s as part of the French house movement and were met with continuous success in the years following, combining elements of house music with funk, techno, disco, rock music and synthpop influences. They are also known for their visual stylization and disguises associated with their music; the duo have worn ornate helmets and gloves to assume robot personas in most of their public appearances since 2001 and rarely grant interviews or appear on television. The duo were managed from 1996 to 2008 by Pedro Winter (also known as Busy P), the head of Ed Banger Records. Bangalter and de Homem-Christo were originally in an indie rock band named Darlin' which disbanded after a short period of time, leaving the two to experiment musically with drum machines and synthesizers. The duo released their debut studio album Homework through Virgin Records in 1997 to highly positive reviews. The duo's next album Discovery (2001) was even more successful, driven by the release of the hit singles \"One More Time\", \"Digital Love\" and \"Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger\". In March 2005, the duo released their third album Human After All to mixed reviews. However, the singles \"Robot Rock\" and \"Technologic\" achieved considerable success in the United Kingdom. Daft Punk toured throughout 2006 and 2007 and released the live album Alive 2007, which won a Grammy Award for Best Electronic/Dance Album. The duo later composed the score for the Disney film Tron: Legacy in 2010, and released its soundtrack album that same year. In January 2013, Daft Punk left Virgin for Columbia Records, and released their next album Random Access Memories in 2013 to worldwide critical acclaim. The album's lead single \"Get Lucky\" became an international success, peaking on top 10 charts in 32 countries. Random Access Memories won five Grammy Awards in 2014, including Album of the Year and Record of the Year for \"Get Lucky\"."@en ;

In May 2009 the band performed on BBC 6 Music's Marc Riley show. In July 2009 the band recorded the remaining tracks for their debut full-length album Boo in Stockholm with Johannes Berglund.

Since 1992, the band has consisted of Joe Elliott (lead vocals), Rick Savage (bassist, backing vocals), Rick Allen (drums, backing vocals), Phil Collen (guitar, backing vocals), and Vivian Campbell (guitar, backing vocals). This is the band's longest-standing line-up. The band's strongest commercial success came between the early 1980s and the early 1990s. Their 1981 album, High 'n' Dry, was produced by Robert John \"Mutt\" Lange, who helped them begin to define their style, and the album's standout track \"Bringin' On the Heartbreak\" became one of the first rock videos played on MTV in 1982. The band's next studio album, Pyromania in January 1983, with \"Photograph\" as the lead single, turned Def Leppard into a household name. In the U.S., Pyromania was certified Diamond (10\u00D7 Platinum). In 2003, the album ranked number 384 on Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time. Def Leppard's fourth album Hysteria, released in August 1987, topped the UK and U.S. album charts. As of 2009, it has reached beyond the success of Pyromania, having been certified 12\u00D7 Platinum for sales of over 12 million in the U.S. and has gone on to sell over 25 million copies worldwide. The album spawned seven hit singles, including the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 number one \"Love Bites\", alongside \"Pour Some Sugar on Me\", \"Hysteria\", \"Armageddon It\", \"Animal\", \"Rocket\", and \"Women\". Their next studio album, Adrenalize (the first following the death of guitarist Steve Clark), reached number one in the UK and U.S. charts in 1992, and contained several hits, including \"Let's Get Rocked\" and \"Have You Ever Needed Someone So Bad\". Their 1993 album, Retro Active, contained the acoustic hit song \"Two Steps Behind\", while their greatest-hits album Vault, released in 1995, featured the UK hit \"When Love & Hate Collide\". As one of the world's best-selling music artists, Def Leppard have sold more than 100 million records worldwide, and have two albums with RIAA Diamond certification, Pyromania and Hysteria. They are one of only five rock bands with two original studio albums selling over 10 million copies in the U.S. The band were ranked No. 31 in VH1's \"100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock\" and ranked No. 70 in \"100 Greatest Artists of All Time\"."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Enigma is a German musical project founded in 1990 by Romanian-German musician and producer Michael Cretu. Cretu had released several solo records, collaborated with various artists, and produced albums for his then wife, German pop singer Sandra, before he conceived the idea of a New Age, Worldbeat project. He recorded the first Enigma studio album, MCMXC a.D. (1990), with contributions from David Fairstein and Frank Peterson. The album remains Enigma's biggest, helped by the international hit single, \"Sadeness (Part I)\", which sold 12 million units alone. According to Cretu, the inspiration for the creation of the project came from his desire to make a kind of music that did not obey \"the old rules and habits\" and presented a new form of artistic expression with mystic and experimental components. Enigma followed MCMXC a.D. with a series of albums that involved several musicians and producers working with Cretu. The first was The Cross of Changes (1993), which incorporated tribal and ethnic influences and sold over 8 million copies worldwide, followed by Le Roi est mort, vive le Roi! (1996), which blended together the Gregorian chants reminiscent from the first album and the strong intercultural soundscapes present in the second. Enigma's fourth album was The Screen Behind the Mirror, released in 2000, which started a slight departure from the previous world music themes towards a heavier electronic atmosphere. This evolution culminated with Voyageur, its fifth and more pop-based album, and 2006's A Posteriori, a work inspired by the future collision between the Milky Way and Andromeda galaxies, with distinct operatic tones and an electronic spectrum closer to Voyageur than the earlier releases. Seven Lives Many Faces, its seventh album, was released in 2008 and contained a mixture of classical and modern elements ranging from ethnic chants to rap and dubstep influences. Its eighth album, The Fall of a Rebel Angel, was announced for a November 2016 release. Enigma has sold over 70 million records worldwide, reached 60 number 1 songs at the charts around the world and achieved over 100 Gold and Platinum certificates. The project has also received 3 Grammy nominations and is one of the best-selling musical acts of all time."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Exodus is an American thrash metal band formed in 1979 in Richmond, California. Spanning a career of 38 years, Exodus has gone through numerous lineup changes, two extended hiatuses, and the deaths of two former band members. Their current lineup consists of vocalist Steve \"Zetro\" Souza, guitarists Gary Holt and Lee Altus, bassist Jack Gibson and drummer Tom Hunting. Hunting is one of the original members, and departed from Exodus twice, in 1989 and 2004, but rejoined in 2007. Holt joined the band shortly after its formation, and is the only member of Exodus to appear on all their releases. Since its formation, Exodus has released ten studio albums, two live albums and two compilations. Along with Possessed, Testament, Death Angel, Vio-Lence, Forbidden, L\u00E4\u00E4z Rockit and Metallica, whose longtime lead guitarist Kirk Hammett was an original member of Exodus, they are often credited as pioneers of the Bay Area thrash metal scene, and have sold over five million albums worldwide as of 2013. Exodus had particular success in the mid-to-late 1980s with their first three studio albums\u2015Bonded by Blood, Pleasures of the Flesh and Fabulous Disaster. The critical praise given to Fabulous Disaster garnered attention from major labels, including Capitol Records, with whom Exodus had signed in 1989. Exodus released two more studio albums (Impact Is Imminent and Force of Habit) before disbanding in 1994. After temporarily reuniting in 1997-1998, Exodus reformed once again in 2001, and since then, they have released five more studio albums, the most recent being 2014's Blood In, Blood Out. The band is expected to release their next studio album in late 2017."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"(This article is about the rock band. For other uses, see Fallout Boy.) Fall Out Boy is an American rock band formed in Wilmette, Illinois, a suburb of Chicago, in 2001. The band consists of vocalist and guitarist Patrick Stump, bassist Pete Wentz, guitarist Joe Trohman, and drummer Andy Hurley. The band originated from Chicago's hardcore punk scene, with which all members were involved at one point. The group was formed by Wentz and Trohman as a pop punk side project of the members' respective hardcore bands, and Stump joined shortly thereafter. The group went through a succession of drummers before landing Hurley and recording the group's debut album, Take This to Your Grave (2003). The album became an underground success and helped the band gain a dedicated fanbase through heavy touring, as well as some moderate commercial success. Take This to Your Grave has commonly been cited as an influential blueprint for pop punk music in the 2000s. With Wentz as the band's lyricist and Stump as the primary composer, the band's 2005 major-label breakthrough, From Under the Cork Tree, produced two hit singles, \"Sugar, We're Goin Down\" and \"Dance, Dance,\" and went double platinum, transforming the group into superstars and making Wentz a celebrity and tabloid fixture. Fall Out Boy received a Best New Artist nomination at the 2006 Grammy Awards. The band's 2007 follow-up, Infinity on High, landed at number one on the Billboard 200 with 260,000 first week sales. It produced two worldwide hit singles, \"This Ain't a Scene, It's an Arms Race\" and \"Thnks fr th Mmrs.\" Folie \u00E0 Deux, the band's fourth album, created a mixed response from fans and commercially undersold expectations. Following the release of Believers Never Die \u2013 Greatest Hits, the band took a hiatus from 2009 to 2012 to \"decompress,\" exploring various side projects. The band regrouped and recorded Save Rock and Roll (2013), which gave the band its second career number one and produced the top 20 single \"My Songs Know What You Did in the Dark (Light Em Up).\" The group's sixth studio album, American Beauty/American Psycho (2015), released worldwide on Island Records, was preceded by the top 10 hit \"Centuries\" and also spawned the 2x platinum single \"Uma Thurman\" which peaked at 22 on Hot 100. The album peaked at No. 1, making it the band's third No. 1 album and the group's fifth consecutive top 10 album."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Fear Factory is an American industrial metal band that was formed in 1989. During the band's career, they have released nine full-length albums and have evolved through a succession of styles, including nu metal, death metal, groove metal, and thrash metal. Fear Factory was enormously influential on the heavy metal scene in the mid-to-late 1990s. Fear Factory went on hold in March 2002 following some internal disputes, but reformed later that year without founding member Dino Cazares, adding bassist Byron Stroud, and previous bassist Christian Olde Wolbers as guitarist. In April 2009, a new lineup was announced. Cazares returned as lead and rhythm guitarist, and Gene Hoglan as drummer. Bell and Stroud reprised their respective roles, and the band completed a seventh studio album titled Mechanize. Former members Christian Olde Wolbers and Raymond Herrera\u2014both of whom were playing in Arkaea\u2014disputed the legitimacy of the new lineup, and a legal battle from both parties was begun. Fear Factory released its eighth studio album, The Industrialist, in June 2012. Their latest album, Genexus, was released in August 2015. Over the years, Fear Factory has seen changes in its members, with lead vocalist Burton C. Bell being the only consistent member since 1989. The band has performed at three Ozzfests and the inaugural Gigantour. Their singles have charted on the US Mainstream Rock Top 40 and albums on the Billboard Top 40, 100, and 200, and they have sold more than a million albums in the U.S. alone."@en ;
