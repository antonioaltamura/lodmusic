	dbo:abstract	"A Lazarus Taxon is the name of a box set by Chicago post-rock group Tortoise, released in 2006 on the Thrill Jockey label. The set contains three CDs, one DVD and an accompanying 20-page booklet. The CDs contain 33 tracks of rare material from tour, compilation and non-American releases, the band's out of print 1995 album Rhythms, Resolutions & Clusters, which compiled remixes by friends of the band including Steve Albini, Rick Brown, Jim O'Rourke and Brad Wood, and other previously unreleased material including a restored remix by the Minutemen's Mike Watt that was delivered too late for inclusion on Rhythms... and subsequently fell victim to a malfunctioning DAT machine. Tortoise bassist Bundy K Brown himself restored the tape, twelve years after it was recorded. The DVD contains most of the band's music videos as well as over two hours of \"extensive and rare\" live performance footage. The set was compiled by the band themselves. The set's title is derived from the palaeontological term \"lazarus taxon\", meaning a taxon (or grouping of organisms) that disappears from the fossil record only to reappear again at a later point, which in turn refers back to the resurrection of Lazarus by Jesus in the New Testament. The photography used in the artwork was personally selected by the band from the work of retired Swiss police officer Arnold Odermatt, who became noted for his pictures of accident scenes and police training, often returning to accident scenes he had photographed to shoot them again once they were free of people. Tortoise were given permission to use the pictures from Odermatt himself, and from Berlin's Springer & Winckler Galerie, which first unearthed and promoted the artist's work."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"BBC Sessions is an album of recordings by the rock group The Jimi Hendrix Experience, released on MCA Records on June 2, 1998. It contains all the surviving tracks from their various appearances on BBC radio programmes, such as Saturday Club and Top Gear, recorded in 1967. At a BBC radio 'session', a practice still alive in British radio today, a band is required to record material in a studio quickly with limited overdubbing, largely limited to and relying upon their live sound. Many groups as part of this tradition choose to record some songs that are not part of their main repertoire. The album also includes the only two surviving Hendrix UK TV soundtracks (both BBC) Late Night Line Up (\"Manic Depression\" only survives) and the 1969 Lulu Show (complete). BBC Sessions therefore offers its own unique example of the Experience sound, and a revealing glimpse of a song from their early repertoire Howlin' Wolf's \"Killing Floor\" and their only known studio recording of Bob Dylan's \"Can You Please Crawl Out Your Window?\". Apart from the \"live\" in studio versions of well-known Experience songs, there are several unique studio recordings of songs, i.e. \"Driving South\" (x3), which includes several licks derived from Albert Collins' \"Frosty\" (1962) and \"Thaw Out\" (1965), \"Hoochie Coochie Man\", \"Catfish Blues\", \"Hound Dog\", \"Hear My Train a-Comin'\"(x2) and a couple of novelty tracks: the amusing parody of a BBC Radio 1 jingle \"Radio One\", and a recording with a young Stevie Wonder on drums (a cover of Wonder's own \"I Was Made to Love Her\"). It also includes the sound track from the band's infamous appearance on Lulu's television show in 1969. The Top of the Pops references were overdubbed by Brian Mathews onto Top Gear recordings for the BBC produced Swedish (English language) radio show of the same name. The original recordings minus Brian no longer exist. This collection has been re-released as part of the Hendrix Family's project to remaster Jimi's discography in 2010 by Experience Hendrix and Legacy Recordings. The re-release contains 2 digitally remastered sound discs with \"Burning of the Midnight Lamp\" bonus track from August 24, 1967, and 1 DVD videodisc of footage from recording sessions, and 22 pages of program notes. Some of this material had previously been released by Rykodisc in 1988 on an album titled Radio One."@en ;

Campbell collaborated with a number of producers and songwriters, including Gavin Friday, Tim Simenon, Youth, Justin Strauss, Bruce Roberts and P.M. Dawn. Musically, babywoman is an R&B album that also fuses different genres, such as house, trip hop or country. Upon its release, the album received generally negative reviews from music critics and was a commercial failure in the United Kingdom, where it didn't reach a higher position than 75 on the UK Albums Chart. However, the album was a success in Japan and sold over 1 million copies worldwide.

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cinderella\u0027s_Eyes>	rdf:type	schema:MusicAlbum ;
	dbo:abstract	"Cinderella's Eyes is the debut studio album by English recording artist Nicola Roberts. A member of the British girl group Girls Aloud, Roberts drew inspiration from her time with the group. Her experience with Girls Aloud's formation found her being labelled \"ugly\" by the media, and the constant negative attention and subsequent personal problems resulted in her struggling with her confidence. She started recording for the album in 2010 and co-wrote all of the original tracks on the album, working closely with producers Dimitri Tikovoi, Maya von Doll (from electro group Sohodolls) and Diplo on the album, as well as Canadian electropop band Dragonette. The concept of the album derived from fairy tales, focusing mostly upon Cinderella after titling the album Cinderella's Eyes. The album artwork features Roberts next to a collection of vintage artefacts wearing a modern interpretation of the Cinderella glass slipper, co-produced by shoe designer Atalanta Weller. The album is characterised by electropop themes and autobiographical lyrics. The album opens with \"Beat of My Drum\", an electropop dance track which features chants, something that is presented throughout the album. Her use of rap is included on tracks such as \"I\", \"Yo-Yo\" and \"Sticks + Stones\". The latter track was written about her lack of confidence during her times with Girls Aloud, and discusses the times she was labelled \"ugly\" by the media. Roberts wrote the track to highlight the subject of bullying and to make others in the same position feel less alone. The album was inspired by Robyn and Kate Bush, both of whom have received comparisons to songs within the album. Cinderella's Eyes received critical acclaim from music critics who praised the production on the album, Roberts' voice and her lyrics. The album was also praised for being the most original solo album from any of the members of Girls Aloud. Although the album did not reach commercial success, many critics commented that the album was under-rated and deserved more appreciation. \"Beat of My Drum\" was released as the album's first track. The track gathered acclaim from critics and performed well commercially, charting at number 27 in the United Kingdom. A music video directed by Wendy Morgan showed Roberts performing in 1970s-inspired outfits. The second single, \"Lucky Day\", was released a week before the album and featured production from the band Dragonette. It gained positive reviews for its use of pop themes, and the music video directed by Stephen Agnes featured Roberts in the East Village of New York City performing in a floral dress."@en ;

dbr:It_Begins_Again	rdf:type	schema:MusicAlbum ;
	dbo:abstract	"It Begins Again is the tenth studio album recorded by Dusty Springfield and the ninth released. Recorded during the middle of 1977, It Begins Again was her first completed and released album since Cameo five years earlier. Two of the album's titles, \"Turn Me Around\" and \"A Love Like Yours (Don't Come Knocking Every Day)\", were tracks from the abandoned 1974 Longing sessions and Springfield decided to record new versions of both songs for It Begins Again, placing Chi Coltrane's \"Turn Me Around\" as the opening track. It Begins Again, which was Springfield's debut album for the United Artists label in the US and Mercury Records in the UK, was recorded in Los Angeles and produced by Englishman Roy Thomas Baker, at the time best known for helping create the four first albums by Queen. Musically It Begins Again was however geared towards the American adult contemporary, pop and disco markets. Contributing on the album were some of the most renowned American session musicians of the era, such as Jay Graydon, Jeff Baxter, Joe Sample, Ed Greene and David Paich and it featured backing vocals by Pattie Brooks, Dianne Brooks and Brenda Russell \u2013 all acclaimed recording artists and composers in their own right. The songs on the album were also written by a number of notable composers and lyricists, among others Nona Hendryx, Lesley Gore, Ellen Weston, Dean Parks, Peter Allen and Carole Bayer Sager. Barry Manilow's \"Sandra\", often singled out as the highlight of the set, is a gentle piano ballad that portrays the life of a suburban housewife who minutely details her daily chores, all the while assuring both herself and the listener that \"I swear I love my husband and I swear I love my kids\" \u2013 yet in the last verse she reveals that she one day found herself cutting her wrists \"doing the dishes, quite by mistake. It was real touch and go for a while.\" Containing a diverse range of styles, It Begins Again was seen as somewhat experimental by Springfield herself, as well as music critics, who generally gave it favourable reviews. Despite the critical reception, the hopeful album title, as well as a series of promotional performances made in both the US and the UK promoting the up-tempo singles \"A Love Like Yours\" and \"That's the Kind of Love I've Got for You\", It Begins Again only briefly made the charts in Britain, peaking at No. 41, and did not chart in the US. Springfield stated that she had wanted to try something different, but felt that she now needed to move into a different style, a commercial, lightweight R&B, which resulted in the following album Living Without Your Love. In 2002, Mercury/Universal Music UK released the album on CD for the first time, then also including Tom Moulton's extended remix of \"That's the Kind of Love I've Got for You\", originally only released as a promotional 12\" single, which took advantage of the popularity of disco at the time. The song which was the closing track on It Begins Again was, however, the only true disco song on the album. The 12\" version was somewhat popular with US deejays and the track in fact managed to reach No. 31 in the US Hot Dance Club Play chart. When the Pet Shop Boys in 2005 released their instalment in the mix album series Back to Mine they both included a Dusty Springfield track, Neil Tennant chose her 60s classic \"Goin' Back\" \u2013 and Chris Lowe rather surprisingly the ballad \"I'd Rather Leave While I'm in Love\" from It Begins Again."@en ;

At the time of its release, it was the best selling Bad Brains album and also featured an MTV video for the lead-off track \"Soul Craft\" directed by Paul Rachman who later went on to produce and direct the feature documentary American Hardcore. Drummer Earl Hudson, though pictured on the cover, is absent, with the drum parts instead being performed by Mackie Jayson of the Cro-Mags. In an interview with MTV, guitarist Dr. Know said that the album's title comes from urgency and swiftness. The album was a crossover release that contained elements of several genres, including funk, hip hop, heavy metal, punk, and reggae, which made a notable return after being absent from 1986's I Against I. It is also the band's most controversial release, containing lyrics that some claim were homophobic. More specifically, the song \"Don't Blow Bubbles\" had lyrics that were generally interpreted as being homophobic and suggesting that AIDS was God's cure for homosexuality. When asked about the song, guitarist Dr. Know said that \"We wrote that song as kind of an angry warning to homosexuals. We didn't really mean to insult them, but a lot of people we knew seemed to be living with their eyes closed.\" In a 2007 interview where bassist Darryl Jenifer called their previous homophobic views \"ignorant\", he was asked about the song and the furor over the lyrics and replied \"They don't understand that we've grown. Just like anyone, I'm not ashamed to say, 'Maybe I could have been\u2026' Damn right, I was a homophobe! I shouldn't have to explain that to the world because everyone will do that. That's wisdom. You have to grow to be wise.\" The Sacramento internet radio show Soulcraft got their name from the first track of this album."@en ;

At the time it was a farewell album, released prior to their farewell tour. In an interview, Rudolf Schenker explained that their goal was to update their sound from their classic period in the 1980s. He explained: \"If you take the best song elements from the '80s albums, and put these on one album, you come up with the Sting in the Tail album. So in this case we tried to re-invent the Scorpions sound from the '80s, using the same DNA after putting in a modern twist, to make it sound like today's music.\" The album features a duet on the song \"The Good Die Young\" with the Finnish symphonic metal singer Tarja Turunen, best known as the former lead vocalist of Nightwish. A tentative title for the album was Humanity: Hour II, however this was eventually scrapped. First week sales in the United States were 18,500 copies sold placing the album at No. 23 on the Billboard 200 chart. In Germany the album debuted at No. 2, but fell in its second week to No. 3, in France at No. 16 and in Greece at No. 1. The album also peaked at Number 2 on the Billboard Rock Charts. The Get Your Sting and Blackout World Tour promoting the album was initially reported to be the band's last tour, though this proved not to be the case. In later interviews given after the tour had started, at least two band members (Klaus Meine and Matthias Jabs) stated that the band was not going to stop touring and was in fact, working on new material."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Flight Log (1966\u20131976), released in January 1977 as a double-LP as Grunt CYL2-1255). It is a compilation of Jefferson Airplane and Airplane-related tracks, including tracks by Jefferson Starship and Hot Tuna, as well as solo tracks by Paul Kantner, Grace Slick, and Jorma Kaukonen. Although primarily a compilation album, the album includes one previously unreleased song, \"Please Come Back\" written by Ron Nagle and performed by Jefferson Starship. \"Please Come Back\" is not available on any other release. Among the session musicians featured on the album are two members of the Grateful Dead and one member of Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young. David Crosby appears on one track, and Jerry Garcia plays on three tracks, two of which also feature Mickey Hart. The album included a lavish 12-page full-color, full-size (12 sq.in.) booklet, containing photographs of the band throughout the period covered by the compilation. It also contained a detailed history of the band, written by Patrick Snyder of Rolling Stone magazine. Flight Log was first reissued on CD by BMG Japan on October 22, 2008 as a part of the \"Paper Sleeve Collection\" reissue series (BVCM-35468-9). The release features an exact reproduction of the Grunt 1977 edition of the LP packaging including a reduced scale reproduction of the original booklet and inner sleeve jackets for the CDs. Also included is a second booklet containing all the lyrics in both English and Japanese. The only omission by BMG Japan was not reproducing the original GRUNT label on the CDs. The audio quality is as good as the original master tapes available for the Japanese LP pressing and features JVC K2 24 Bit Remastering. Unfortunately it sounds as if the master tapes had been damaged on at least three songs, and significantly obvious on the introduction of \"Silver Spoon\". CD 1 contains Side A and B, and CD 2 contains Side C and D. On April 5, 2011, BGO Records released a remastered edition of Flight Log in a standard jewel case with cardboard slip cover. The BGO version is said to be a sonic improvement on the BMG/Sony edition, nonetheless, certain tape defects such as on Silver Spoon still exist."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"The Grateful Dead Movie Soundtrack is a five CD live album by the Grateful Dead. It was recorded from October 16 to October 20, 1974, and was released on March 15, 2005. In 1974 the Grateful Dead were exhausted from touring, and it had proven too expensive and cumbersome to tour with the \"Wall of Sound\" sound system. In response, the group decided to stop touring for an indefinite period of time. In October they played five nights at the Winterland Ballroom in San Francisco, California. As they were the last concerts before the hiatus, the Grateful Dead wanted them to be properly recorded and documented by a film crew. The results were a rather unsuccessful live album, Steal Your Face, and a film, The Grateful Dead Movie. The movie was released in theaters in 1977, and on videotape in 1981. In 2004 it was expanded to a double DVD with bonus cuts and documentaries. A few months later, a five CD album was released as The Grateful Dead Movie Soundtrack. The album included even more previously unreleased tracks, including a rare \"Tomorrow Is Forever\". The DVD contains one track not released on the soundtrack (\"Sugaree\" from October 18, which was previously released on Steal Your Face). Likewise, half of the selections are unique to this box set and not included in the DVD movie. Furthermore, despite being a rather comprehensive 5-disc box set, it only captures about half of the nearly 60 different songs played across this 5 night stand."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"A Love Trilogy is the third studio album by American singer and songwriter Donna Summer. It was released on March 5, 1976, just eight months after her international breakthrough with the single and album of the same name - \"Love To Love You Baby\". The bold, sexual nature of that particular song had earned Summer the title \"The first lady of love.\" By now Summer's work was being distributed in the U.S. by Casablanca Records, and the label encouraged Summer, Moroder and team to continue in this vein. The Love Trilogy album uses the first side for one long disco track in three distinct movements ('Try Me', 'I Know', 'We Can Make It', and coalescing into the \"love trilogy\" of the title - \"Try Me, I Know We Can Make It\". Side Two contained three additional erotic disco songs, including a cover of Barry Manilow's \"Could It Be Magic\". The album's artwork showed Summer floating light-heartedly through the clouds, again adding to the image of her as a fantasy figure. The album sold well across the world, (it was her second, consecutive album to be certified Gold in the United States) and again topped the national US Disco charts. Edited versions of \"Try Me, I Know We Can Make It\" and \"Could It Be Magic\" did not reach the top forty on the Billboard Hot 100, but the latter was a sizable R&B hit (#21) and disco hit (#3). Casablanca released a 12 inch version of \"Try Me I Know We Can Make It\" with \"Love to Love You Baby\" on the reverse side. The single \"Could It Be Magic\" was a Top 5 hit in the Netherlands."@en ;

The compilation was released alongside a DVD of the same name, collecting the band's music videos. Greatest Hits was created by Geffen shortly after the band's February 2005 breakup, termed an \"indefinite hiatus\" by the label. Tensions had risen in the group and guitarist Tom DeLonge desired to take time off. Bassist Mark Hoppus and Travis Barker argued with DeLonge regarding the band's future and their possible next album, and heated exchanges led to DeLonge's exit. In the interim, Hoppus and Barker continued playing together in +44, and DeLonge formed his new rock outfit Angels & Airwaves. The compilation is essentially a collection of the band\u2019s most successful singles with one new song and a non-album track. The collection covers tracks from the band's debut album Cheshire Cat (1995) to their most recent studio effort, Blink-182 (2003). Greatest Hits features numerous hit singles by the band, including \"Dammit\", \"What's My Age Again?\", \"All the Small Things\", \"The Rock Show\", \"First Date\", \"Feeling This\" and \"I Miss You\". The B-side \"Not Now\", which was recorded during the Blink-182 sessions, makes its first appearance on this compilation and was released as its lead single; a cover of \"Another Girl, Another Planet\" by the Only Ones was sent to radio as an airplay single. Greatest Hits peaked at number six on the Billboard 200 album chart. Critics were generally very positive regarding Greatest Hits, viewing it a suitable, reflective compilation of the band's hits. Andy Greenwald of Blender called it a \"flawless compilation,\" covering the group's transition from \"nudists to near-geniuses.\" Greatest Hits has been certified platinum in Canada and triple platinum in Australia."@en ;

dbr:Hot_Rocks_1964-1971	rdf:type	schema:MusicAlbum ;
	dbo:abstract	"Hot Rocks 1964\u20131971 is the first compilation album of Rolling Stones music released by former manager Allen Klein's ABKCO Records (who gained control of the band's Decca/London material in 1970) after the band's departure from Decca and Klein. Released in late 1971, it proved to be The Rolling Stones' biggest-selling release of their career and an enduring and popular retrospective. After reportedly having been duped by Klein to unknowingly sign over the recording copyrights to all of their material from 1963 to 1970, The Rolling Stones left Decca and formed their own label, Rolling Stones Records, with a new distributor. They recorded Sticky Fingers throughout 1970, releasing it the following spring. Although Klein\u2014and now ABKCO\u2014no longer had The Rolling Stones as clients, their fruitful catalogue was ripe for the picking and, thus, Hot Rocks 1964\u20131971 was quickly compiled as a double album greatest hits package. While the album carries most of the band's biggest hits during their first decade, it does drop a few of them to include standout tracks such as \"Play With Fire\", \"Under My Thumb\" and \"Gimme Shelter\" giving listeners a more well-rounded impression of The Rolling Stones' music in this era. Although \"Brown Sugar\" and \"Wild Horses\" are a part of Sticky Fingers, those two songs are co-owned by the band and Allen Klein because The Rolling Stones recorded the songs while they were still under contract to Decca."@en ;

The American version of this record had a slightly different track listing, with \"Endless Grey Ribbon\" being deleted and replaced with the UK single A-side, \"American Squirm.\" The latter song includes members of Elvis Costello & The Attractions, namely Elvis on backing vocals, Bruce Thomas on bass and Pete Thomas on drums. Credited to \"Nick Lowe and His Sound,\" the B-side of this single was Elvis & The Attractions' version of the Lowe-penned \"(What's So Funny 'Bout) Peace, Love & Understanding?\" \"Endless Grey Ribbon\" did get an American release as the B-side of the \"Cruel to Be Kind\" single. Released on CD by Demon/Fiend (EU) and Columbia (US and Canada) in 1990, it fell out of print quickly and was available only in used CD stores and web sites. Yep Roc Records reissued the album on CD on March 15, 2011, containing all tracks from the US and UK versions, as well as the B-Side \"Basing Street.\""@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Operation: Mindcrime II is the ninth studio album by the American progressive metal band Queensr\u00FFche. It is a concept album and the sequel to the group's 1988 release, Operation: Mindcrime, which had achieved both critical and commercial success. Mindcrime II was released on April 4, 2006 in the United States, on March 29 in Japan, on March 31 in Germany, and on April 3 in the rest of world, with the Rhino Entertainment label providing distribution. The lead single, titled \"I'm American,\" was performed by Queensr\u00FFche during their 2005 tour, which they took in support of the group Judas Priest. The album resumes the story of Mindcrime, which is that of Nikki, a drug-addicted political revolutionary who had worked as an assassin before his disillusionment and arrest. Nikki had been jailed for the murder of prostitute-turned-nun Sister Mary at the end of Mindcrime, with his sanity slipping as he genuinely didn't know who had killed Mary and had grown close to her before her death. As Mindcrime II begins, eighteen-years-later, Nikki is released from prison and begins to plot his revenge against Dr. X, a manipulative demagogue from the first album that had treated Nikki as his puppet. Vocalist Pamela Moore reprises her role as Sister Mary for the album. The role of Dr. X (played by actor Anthony Valentine on the first album) went to famous heavy metal singer Ronnie James Dio. Singer Geoff Tate handles the vocals for the protagonist. Following the split between Geoff Tate and the rest of Queensr\u00FFche in 2012, it was revealed in a sworn declaration by producer Jason Slater that the album received very limited contributions from the band members aside from Tate and Mike Stone. Much of the music was recorded by studio musicians due to conflicts between Tate and his band mates. Drummer Scott Rockenfield did not play on the album at all. As well, most of the guitars, including Michael Wilton's tracks, were re-recorded by engineer Mitch Doran. Some of the bass tracks used are demo recordings played by Slater, while the drum track to \"I'm American\" is a MIDI recording made by Doran that was not originally intended for use on the final album. The album debuted on the Billboard 200 album chart at No. 14, the highest chart position for a Queensr\u00FFche album since Promised Land peaked at No. 3 in 1994. The tracks \"I'm American\" and \"The Hands\" have been released as singles, with accompanying music videos being created."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Get Behind Me Satan is the fifth studio album by American alternative rock band The White Stripes, released on June 7, 2005, on V2 Records. Though still basic in production style, the album marked a distinct change from its guitar-heavy 2003 predecessor, Elephant. With its reliance on piano-driven melodies and experimentation with marimba on \"The Nurse\" and \"Forever For Her (Is Over For Me)\", Get Behind Me Satan plays down the punk, garage rock and blues influences that dominated earlier White Stripes albums. Frontman Jack White plays with different technique than in the past, trading in his electric guitar for piano, mandolin, and acoustic guitar on all but a handful of tracks, as his usual riff-conscious lead guitar style is overtaken by a predominantly rhythmic approach. Rolling Stone ranked it the third best album of the year and it received the Grammy for Best Alternative Music Album in 2006. As of February 2007, Get Behind Me Satan had sold 850,000 units in the United States. Get Behind Me Satan was the only Jack White record not to receive a commercial release on vinyl, with only 600 promotional copies being released originally."@en ;

The track \"Chemistry\" was featured on the soundtrack for 40 Days and 40 Nights. The song \"One True Love\" was co-written by the band's singer/guitarist, Dan Wilson, and music legend Carole King. The song \"Get a Grip\" is an ode to masturbation. The special edition of the album features cover art with orange (or pink in the UK) fluid in the vials instead of the blue fluid of the original.

	dbo:abstract	"Ballad of Easy Rider is the eighth album by the American rock band The Byrds and was released in November 1969 on Columbia Records (see 1969 in music). The album was named after the song \"Ballad of Easy Rider\", which had been written by The Byrds' guitarist and singer, Roger McGuinn (with help from Bob Dylan), as the theme song for the 1969 film, Easy Rider. The title was also chosen in an attempt to capitalize on the commercial success of the film, although the majority of the music on the album had no connection with it. Nonetheless, the association with Easy Rider heightened The Byrds' public profile and resulted in Ballad of Easy Rider becoming the band's highest charting album for two years in the U.S. The album peaked at #36 on the Billboard Top LPs chart and #41 on the UK Albums Chart. The title track was released as a preceding single in October 1969, achieving moderate success on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. A second single taken from the album, \"Jesus Is Just Alright\", was released in December 1969 but only managed to reach #97 on the Billboard Hot 100. The album was the second to be recorded by the Roger McGuinn, Clarence White, Gene Parsons, and John York line-up of The Byrds, although York would be fired shortly after its completion.

Elsewhere, \"Voulez-Vous\" had been the A-side in its own right but it was not included on the album. However, the track \"I Wonder (Departure)\" was not believed to have been released as a single anywhere, but was featured.

It was his first album to be written and recorded entirely by Rundgren alone, though large portions of earlier albums also had been recorded alone (such as the first three sides of the double-LP Something/Anything). The album is reminiscent of the artist's earlier, more pop-oriented records and marks a lyrical return to the subject of relationships (as in the single \"Can We Still Be Friends\"), as well as his views on social inequality (as in the songs \"Bag Lady\" and \"Bread\"). It remains one of his most popular albums. Mink Hollow refers to a valley, and the road that runs through it, in Lake Hill, New York just west of Woodstock, NY. Rundgren recorded this album while living in a house on Mink Hollow Road. While many think that the hermit referred to in the title is Todd, it actually originated and refers to the character and events from a local legend centered on Mink Hill Road in Lake Hill, NY. The legend involved a 3-legged dog, a missing girl and an escaped mental patient hiding in the surrounding forested mountains. Yet, Rundgren himself acknowledged being a \"studio hermit\", working in an \"insular little 24-hour-a-day think tank\", and declared that prior to this experience he wasn't aware that \"too much social interaction [had] affected [his] overall creativity.\""@en ;

All albums to that date are represented with the exception of their debut, Rocka Rolla, although a live version of \"Victim of Changes\" (from Unleashed in the East which appears to have an American sounding audience dubbed at the end, instead of the familiar Japanese one from the live album) is used rather than the studio version on Sad Wings of Destiny. This is because the band no longer owns the rights to their first two albums. The band selected the tracks themselves, and made comments in the sleeve-notes. As an album it showcases versatility of their musical career. This album also brought Rob Halford back into the fold for a short while following his departure from the band due to internal tensions. The album cover by Mark Wilkinson (who had done the band's cover art from Ram It Down to Nostradamus) combines elements from the band's previous releases. In the foreground are the Hellion from Screaming for Vengeance and the Painkiller from its eponymous 1990 album. Under the Hellion's body is a razor blade, a reference to the album British Steel. The lower left shows the female hand holding a gear shift knob from Turbo and a mannequin wearing sunglasses and a studded leather headband representing Killing Machine/Hell Bent for Leather. The lower right corner features the door and columns from Sin After Sin, the metallic head from Stained Class enveloped in smoke, and the Metallian from Defenders of the Faith. At the end of the trail of flames in front of the Metallian is the shaft of light from Point of Entry. Additionally, one of the chimneys on the factory in the lower right corner is the band's familiar trident logo.

Like many of their studio albums, Minimum-Maximum was released in two different language versions: the band's native German, and English for the international market, though of the 23 tracks on the album, only the recordings of \"The Model\", \"Radioactivity\", \"Trans-Europe Express\"/\"Metal on Metal\", \"Computer World\", \"Pocket Calculator\" and \"The Robots\" are actually different between the releases. The album title, an excerpt from the lyrics of the song \"Elektro-Kardiogramm\" (which only exists in an English-language version), is the same for both German and English versions. In an interview for Mojo Magazine, Ralf H\u00FCtter regretted the fact that they could not include recordings from their 2004 concert in Santiago de Chile: The album was also released as a double live concert DVD with DTS 5.1 sound on 5 December 2005.

dbr:New_Traditionalists	rdf:type	schema:MusicAlbum ;
	dbo:abstract	"New Traditionalists is the fourth studio album by the new wave rock band Devo. It features the minor hits \"Through Being Cool\" and \"Beautiful World.\" The sound continued in the vein of the previous album Freedom of Choice, with synthesizers moving even further to the forefront and guitars becoming more subdued. Some of the tracks feature drum machines for the first time on a Devo record. In addition, the lyrics are frequently dark and vitriolic. With the success of \"Whip It\" and its associated album Freedom of Choice, Devo attracted a new, more pop-oriented audience that was less interested in Devo's artistic theories and intelligent lyrics. In response, New Traditionalists was intended to be a much darker, deeper and serious album. The lead-in track, \"Through Being Cool,\" is a direct attack on new fans who didn't understand Devo's message. The name of the album was inspired by a Japanese ultra-right wing political group called The New Traditionalists. In the words of Devo bassist and co-songwriter Jerry Casale, \"We became The New Traditionalists, but turned it on its ear. We appropriated the idea of that, meaning we were going to provide you with new traditions to forget about the old ones.\" Most of the songs on the album are darker and more direct than on previous Devo albums. The exception to this is \"Beautiful World,\" whose message seems optimistic at first but changes as the song progresses. This is made even clearer by the song's promotional video. On \"Enough Said,\" Devo made one of their first overtly political statements, attacking world leaders and the political process: \"Take all the leaders from around the world/Put them together in a great big ring/Televise it as the lowest show on Earth/And let them fight like hell to see who's king.\" As with every Devo album and tour, the band developed a new look for the album, eschewing the Energy Dome headgear, and replacing it with the plastic \"New Traditionalist Pomp,\" reportedly modeled after President John F. Kennedy's famous pompadour, though in one interview, bassist Gerald Casale claims it to be modeled on Ronald Reagan's own hairstyle. They also wore blue V-neck T-shirts with the New Traditionalists astronaut logo on the black sleeves. This shirt can be seen on the US and Australian versions of the album cover. On the European cover, Devo is seen wearing \"Sleeveless Maxi-Turtleneck Sweaters.\" The T-shirts, turtlenecks and plastic versions of the pomps were all available through Devo's fan club catalog."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"The Rainbow Children is the twenty-fourth studio album by American recording artist Prince. It was released on November 20, 2001 by NPG Records and Redline Entertainment. It was also released through Prince's website earlier in the year. It is the first album released outside of the NPG Music Club to be released under the name of Prince again, as he had reverted to his previous stage name from his symbolic moniker a year earlier. This concept album illustrates common Prince themes of spirituality and human sexuality, as well as love and racism, through the fictitious story of a social movement toward a Martin Luther King, Jr.-inspired utopian society. The album seems to allude to his recent conversion to the Jehovah's Witnesses religion, but Egyptian monotheism and New Age concepts such as the Akashic records are used as metaphors as well. Jazzier than any of his previous efforts, fan reaction was divided when this album was released. Some fans saw the album as a musical and spiritual evolution for Prince. Musically, The Rainbow Children marked a shift back towards a more \"organic\" sound for Prince. Unlike its predecessors, the album featured live drums, and made ample use of horns. Many songs were performed live during Prince's 2002 One Nite Alone... Tour, which became an instant success with fans and critics alike. The Rainbow Children was released through the independent distributor Redline Entertainment, and was released with minimal promotion as per Prince's wishes, who wanted to focus more on the music and less on the sales factor of the release. It has sold 158,000 copies in US stores as of summer 2007, and an estimated 560,000 copies worldwide. The album also had a dedicated promotional website that offered the tracks \"She Loves Me 4 Me\" and \"Mellow\" as free MP3 downloads."@en ;

The group produced a (supposedly) million-dollar record with Arista, then found themselves in trouble with the label after playing an extraordinarily hardcore set. It is said that an Arista representative was heard to admonish the group, yelling \"We thought you were going to be like the Dave Matthews Band!\" The group claimed that they had made no such promise, and Arista allowed them to take the record with them when they left. This album was then given to Tommy Boy for release, with the approval their fans. In December, 2009, the Portland Phoenix ranked Viva Nueva! the tenth greatest local album of the decade, saying that, \"The fact that the vagaries of the music business beat them back doesn't diminish its greatness,\" and called it, \"Maine's first real major-league rock album.\""@en ;

Asked by artist Peter Blake to create something musical and with a Liverpool spirit to it, in order to complement his concurrent artwork exhibition, McCartney ended up harking all the way back to session chatter by the Beatles (hence their \"involvement\") and using snippets of his 1991 classical piece Paul McCartney's Liverpool Oratorio. He also can be heard walking the streets and asking various pedestrians to give their impressions of Liverpool and the Beatles. The album also incorporates chopped up beats and digital manipulation of assorted sound clips. Liverpool Sound Collage was nominated for the 2001 Grammy Award for Best Alternative Music Album.

	dbo:abstract	"Dreams Never Die is the fourth regular studio album by Tiffany, released on November 21, 1993 (see 1993 in music). It represented an attempt to return to pop success three years after her last album, and five years after her last commercially successful one. It was released in various countries of Asia, but not in the United States; she had retained a greater degree of popularity in Asia than in the United States. An American release was planned but never released; it was expected to have some changes from the Asian version, because, as Tiffany said at the time, \"A lot of the stuff in the Asia market is a little more pop than what I want to do here. I want to break away from the bubble gum thing... My goal is to do not hard rock, but a semi-rock sound.\" Earlier in 1993, Tiffany (who was by then married to makeup artist Bulmaro \"Junior\" Garcia and had given birth to her son Elijah) gave a series of performances at the Las Vegas Hilton's casino lounge, which included songs from this album. This album was produced by Tiffany's former manager, George Tobin, with whom she had earlier split, and who had been widely criticized for his exploitative management style, but also widely credited for achieving Tiffany's pop success. However, this business relationship soon soured; according to Tiffany, this happened when she discovered that the songs Tobin had given her to sing on this album were previously used by another Tobin act, PC Quest. Tiffany and Tobin went their separate ways, with Tiffany moving to Nashville and attempting a career as a country singer; this, however, never led to any record releases, and by 2000 she was back to pop music. In 2005, Tobin re-released Dreams Never Die through CD Baby, with previously-unreleased bonus tracks from Tiffany's early studio sessions. According to Tobin, \"I've had many inquiries about the \"Dreams Never Die\" album, so after watching and listening to some of the talent shows that are on TV now, I decided to re-release the DND CD.\" After some fan criticism, he commented further: \"I'm not 'cashing in' at this late date, or trying to steal some success from Dust Off and Dance.\""@en ;

dbr:Elvis_Now	rdf:type	schema:MusicAlbum ;
	dbo:abstract	"Elvis Now is a gold-selling Elvis Presley album from 1972. Despite the \"now\" in the title, the tracks on this album were recorded anywhere from one to three years before its release. The Beatles' \"Hey Jude\" was a leftover from the sessions at the American Studio in Memphis in early 1969. \"Sylvia\" and \"I Was Born About Ten Thousand Years Ago\" were recorded during the Nashville sessions of June 1970 (the latter had been released in fragmentary form on the Elvis Country album). The rest of the songs were from more recent sessions held at RCA Studio B in Nashville in March, May, and June 1971. Unlike Elvis' other albums of that period (Elvis Country, He Touched Me and Elvis sings The Wonderful World of Christmas, each dedicated to a particular genre) Elvis Now encompasses a variety of genres, including country, gospel, soul and pop. The only single from the album, \"Until It's Time for You to Go\" / \"We Can Make The Morning\" reached number 9 on the Adult Contemporary Chart in the US in March 1972 and number 5 on the UK Singles Chart in April 1972. The album was certified Gold on March 27, 1992 by the RIAA. \"Sylvia\" became a big hit for Elvis in Brazil in the 1970s. In 2010 an extended version of the album was released as part of the FTD collector series. It consists of the original 1972 album and a number of bonus tracks, originating from the 1971 Nashville sessions: two non-album singles from 1971 (\"I'm Leavin'\" and \"It's Only Love\"), a B-side from the upcoming \"An American Trilogy\" single (\"The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face\") as well as plenty of outtakes, including \"Don't Think Twice, It's All Right\" informal jam, lasting more than nine minutes (its shortened version having been included on the 1973 Elvis album)."@en ;

dbr:Gracias_Por_La_Música	rdf:type	schema:MusicAlbum ;
	dbo:abstract	"Gracias Por La M\u00FAsica is a 1980 album by Swedish pop group ABBA. Gracias Por La M\u00FAsica was originally released due to the unexpected surge in popularity for the group in Latin American countries such as Mexico and Argentina after the release of the Spanish-language versions of \"Chiquitita\" and \"I Have a Dream\" in 1979. These tracks were both released as singles and went on to become big hits. Encouraged by this success, the band therefore decided to record another eight tracks in Spanish and release a full-length album especially for the Latin American market. The songs selected were familiar hits, plus tracks that were thought to have a Latin flavour, such as \"Move On\" and \"Hasta Ma\u00F1ana\". The couple Buddy and Mary McCluskey, both working at RCA Records in Argentina at the time, were again called in to translate the lyrics. During the recording sessions which took place in January 1980 in the Polar Music studios the lead vocalists Agnetha F\u00E4ltskog and Anni-Frid Lyngstad were helped with the pronunciation by Swedish/Spanish journalist Ana Martinez. Neither Benny Andersson nor Bj\u00F6rn Ulvaeus played an active role in the creation of the eight new Spanish tracks, leaving the production in the hands of the group's sound engineer Michael B. Tretow, who recorded the new Spanish vocal overdubs onto existing backing tracks at his home studio. The absence of Andersson and Ulvaeus is most apparent on \"Al Andar\" (the Spanish version of \"Move On\") where the original opening speech from Ulvaeus was replaced by a more conventional opening verse sung by Agnetha. Meanwhile, some of Tretow's new Spanish mixes were significantly different from their English counterparts, reflecting his own personal preferences regarding the handling of drum sounds as well as the significant time gap between the two versions, with some tracks being revisited up to six years after their original completion. Also,Gracias por la m\u00FAsica was certified Platinum in Spain, and stayed on the charts for twenty-one weeks. Gracias Por La M\u00FAsica saw numerous CD issues in the 1980s including releases in Japan in 1986 (on Polydor), Spain in 1989 (on RCA), and a rare CBS issue of an unknown date. The album was deleted in most territories after the compilation CD ABBA Oro: Grandes Exitos, which contained the ten tracks of Gracias Por La M\u00FAsica, was released in 1992, rendering this album obsolete. However, the original version of the album continued to be available in Japan and Argentina until the late 1990s. The album's title is the Spanish translation of the title of one of ABBA's hits, \"Thank You for the Music\". A CD/DVD 'Deluxe Edition' release of the album was released worldwide on 10 November 2014."@en ;

Following a muted response to his previous album, A New Day at Midnight, this album was seen by many as a considerable return to the form that brought Gray international acclaim with White Ladder. This was also the last album recorded with longtime collaborator Craig McClune. Gray cites Sigur R\u00F3s, Sparklehorse, Lucinda Williams, Bj\u00F6rk and Mercury Rev as inspiration for the album. The album was also the first time Gray added a cello player. The original choice for a producer for the album was Daniel Lanois, but as he was busy, he ended up working with Marius de Vries who had produced his previous hit single \"Sail Away.\" Throughout the tour supporting the album, Gray played a different setlist every night. The three singles from the album were \"The One I Love,\" \"Hospital Food,\" and \"Alibi.\" The album was also released on DualDisc format, which included a documentary of the making of the album, a photo gallery, and complete lyrics on the DVD side of the disc. The non-DualDisc CD of the album was one of many titles released with the infamous MediaMax CD-3 copyright protection system."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Meet the Temptations is the debut studio album by the Temptations for the Gordy (Motown) label released in 1964. It includes most of the group's early singles, excluding only the first, \"Oh Mother of Mine\", and its b-side, \"Romance Without Finance\" (later included on a CD reissue of the LP); as well as the single \"Mind Over Matter\" (and its b-side \"I'll Love You Till I Die\"), in which the group is credited as The Pirates. The album consists entirely of previously released singles, including the group's first hit single, \"The Way You Do the Things You Do\". The lineup on the cover features Eddie Kendricks, Melvin Franklin, Paul Williams, Otis Williams, and newest Temptation Davis (later David) Ruffin. Ruffin had just joined the act three months before this album was released, and actually only appears on \"The Way You Do The Things You Do\". The other tracks all feature original Temptation Elbridge \"Al\" Bryant, who was fired from the group in December 1963. Again, excepting the hit single, these tracks all date from the Temptations' slow-selling starting period (during which some Motown staffers referred to them as the \"hitless Temptations\"). Despite local success in Detroit and the midwest, the Temptations released six singles that missed the Top 100 Pop & R&B charts, and one, \"Dream Come True\", which made it to #22 on the R&B singles chart. Most of these songs feature Paul Williams as (main) lead, while Kendricks, Bryant, Franklin, and Otis Williams were given plenty of lead lines, ad-libs and harmony vocals heard throughout the album. Kendricks was also given a small handful of songs to lead as well, including the two charting singles. The album was originally issued only in monaural sound. A stereo remix of the album was issued along with the original mono version in 1966. The bonus tracks were added to the album in 1999."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Raised on Rock/For Ol' Times Sake is a studio album by Elvis Presley released in 1973. Along with the album Elvis, it was released after the massive success of Aloha From Hawaii (although the entire Elvis album contained material recorded before the Aloha show). The album, which sold over one million copies worldwide, was recorded at Stax Studios in Memphis, Tennessee in July 1973 and at Presley's home in Palm Springs, California in September 1973. Two songs from these sessions would be retained for release on the Good Times album the following spring. The initial vocal tracks were recorded in July 1973. \"Raised on Rock\" backed by \"For Ol' Times Sake\" was the only single released from the album, reaching #41 on the Billboard chart and #42 on the Country chart in September 1973. The album was one of the few that failed to chart in the United Kingdom, but the single \"Raised on Rock\" / \"For Ol' Times Sake\" did enter the British charts. Some of the songs are well known covers like \"Are You Sincere\" which had been around for many years, but some new songs like the lead off single were written for Presley, or written by writers he had previously recorded, such as Mark James. The title single, \"Raised on Rock,\" has been noted by historians such as Roy Carr and Mick Farren in Elvis: The Illustrated Record as odd lyrically, as Presley sings in first person about being a child and discovering rock and roll through records such as \"Johnny B. Goode\" when Presley was a contemporary of the artists he cites. In 1979, a stripped down version of \"Are You Sincere\" was included on the album Our Memories of Elvis and released as a single, reaching #10 on the Billboard country chart. In 2007 Raised on Rock was reissued on the Follow That Dream label in a special 2-disc edition that contained the original album tracks along with numerous alternate takes."@en ;

Before hiring Turner, the band had considered singer Jimi Jamison of Survivor, but other obligations made him unavailable. Following its release, Slaves and Masters peaked at No. 87 on the Billboard 200. The album dramatically sold below expectations, as compared to Deep Purple's previous album, The House of Blue Light with vocalist Ian Gillan, which charted at No. 34. Fans of Deep Purple's earlier efforts thought the vocal parts ended up being too melodic. Despite underwhelming album sales, Deep Purple had a relatively successful tour in support of Slaves and Masters in 1991, especially for the band's European leg. Turner was still a member of the group when they began recording their next album in 1992, but under duress from management, Deep Purple ultimately decided to bring back Ian Gillan to the line-up for their 1993 studio album The Battle Rages On... A handful of working tracks originally intended for the follow-up to Slaves and Masters would turn up on subsequent solo releases by Turner."@en ;

dbr:Subliminal_Sandwich	rdf:type	schema:MusicAlbum ;
	dbo:abstract	"Subliminal Sandwich is a 1996 double album released by Meat Beat Manifesto on Interscope Records. A stronger dub and reggae influence is felt here than on any other MBM album. The first disc is standard MBM fare, a highly energetic and densely packed collection of songs that meld a variety of genres together and make heavy use of sampling. The second disc, on the other hand, is far more experimental in nature, being composed of lengthier pieces that incorporate more ambient textures and drones and fewer samples or definable song structures. Subliminal Sandwich was composed during the 1993 tour supporting the Satyricon album and would have been released in 1994 or 1995 if not for legal tangles with Meat Beat's Belgian label Play It Again Sam. The album received a \"9\" rating from NME. The double disc did not sell well in America, despite being on Trent Reznor's Nothing Records and despite having a hooky single - \"Asbestos Lead Asbestos\" - which was accompanied by a big budget video. The record should be regarded as an artistic success, however, as it manages to combine dub, trance, drum and bass, and industrial sounds with truly rare and invigorating samples. The song \"She's Unreal\" was featured on the soundtrack of the 1999 film The Blair Witch Project, on a \"mix tape\" entitled Josh's Blair Witch Mix."@en ;

dbr:The_Best_of_George_Harrison	rdf:type	schema:MusicAlbum ;
	dbo:abstract	"The Best of George Harrison is a 1976 compilation album by English musician George Harrison, released following the expiration of his EMI-affiliated Apple Records contract. Uniquely among all of the four Beatles' solo releases (apart from live albums), it mixes a selection of the artist's Beatles-era songs on one side, with later hits recorded under his own name on the other. The song selection caused some controversy, since it underplayed Harrison's solo achievements during the 1970\u201375 period, for much of which he had been viewed as the most successful ex-Beatle, artistically and commercially. Music critics have also noted the compilation's failure to provide a faithful picture of Harrison's contribution to the Beatles' work, due to the omission of any of his Indian music compositions. In a calculated move by EMI and its American subsidiary, Capitol Records, the compilation was issued during the same month as Harrison's debut on his Warner-distributed Dark Horse label, Thirty Three & 1/3. The Best of George Harrison peaked at number 31 on the US Billboard 200 chart and was certified gold by the RIAA in February 1977, but the album failed to place on Britain's top 60 chart. It is the first of three hits-oriented Harrison compilation albums, and was followed by Best of Dark Horse 1976\u20131989 and the posthumously released Let It Roll: Songs by George Harrison. The album was issued on CD in 1987 featuring the cover artwork from the original British release, rather than the design created in-house by Capitol and used in the majority of territories internationally in 1976. The compilation has yet to be remastered since this 1987 release."@en ;

The songs combine 1980s metal with some blues-influenced elements, as well as the occasional love ballad. The record features many two-part counterpoints provided by guitarists Frank Hannon and Tommy Skeoch, on both electric and acoustic guitars. The hit singles \"Love Song\", \"Heaven's Trail (No Way Out)\", \"Hang Tough\" and \"The Way It Is\" received considerable MTV airplay and rocketed the band to stardom. Many tracks on this album later received acoustic versions on their follow-up album, Five Man Acoustical Jam, a precursor of the Unplugged trend. The album is titled after the controversy about the identity of the inventor of radio. It is posed that Serbian engineer Nikola Tesla (whom the band is named after) is the true inventor of radio, while the Italian Guglielmo Marconi took the credit and is widely regarded as having the title. The album's inner sleeve recounts this story. The album was certified double platinum by the RIAA on July 23, 1998."@en ;

dbr:The_Punch_Line	rdf:type	schema:MusicAlbum ;
	dbo:abstract	"The Punch Line is the first 12-inch and third record release by influential American punk rock band Minutemen, and the fourth-ever release from SST Records. After their previous release, Paranoid Time, sold out its 300-copy pressing, Greg Ginn invited the band to record another album. Less than half the length of most LPs, the total playing time for all 18 songs is a mere 15 minutes. The album was an early milestone release for the band and SST. The Punch Line is also notable for being the only album to feature lead vocals from all three Minutemen. Bassist and primary songwriter Mike Watt sings lead vocals on several tracks, including the opening track \"Search\", \"Ruins\", and the last 3 of the album, \"Gravity\", \"Warfare\" and \"Static\", while drummer George Hurley does a lead vocal (referred to on the album's back cover as \"giv(ing) a speech\") in the middle of \"Ruins\". The title track makes fun of General George A. Custer's death at the hands of Sitting Bull during the Battle of the Little Bighorn. Another track on the album, the instrumental \"Song For El Salvador\", reflects D. Boon's support of the Farabundo Mart\u00ED National Liberation Front in El Salvador. (He was a member of the NGO Committee in Solidarity with the People of El Salvador, or CISPES). Even though the group's name was a reference to their personal and political ideology and not a reflection of the average length of their songs, only two songs on The Punch Line pass the one-minute mark. Most average between 30\u201345 seconds. Minutemen, seeking to be as economical as possible in recording their first album, recorded The Punch Line during one late-night session (when studio time was the cheapest), recorded on previously used tape, and recorded the songs exactly in the order in which they appeared on the record. Overdubs were minimal if anything; Hurley's vocal on \"Ruins\" was actually cut during the basic track stages and picked up by the overhead drum mics. Spot revealed during his interview for the Minutemen documentary We Jam Econo (preserved in the DVD's deleted scenes section) that the first pressing of the record was done with what he considered to be an inferior mastering job and set of stampers; he took possession of the stampers in order to prevent further pressings from being done, forcing a remaster that was used on all vinyl pressings since then. The remastered vocals sound significantly different from the original pressing in which the voices are deeper and slightly muffled. The Punch Line also appears on the My First Bells cassette and the Post-Mersh Vol. 1 CD. The opening track, \"Search\", represented Minutemen on the second Rodney on the ROQ compilation album on Posh Boy Records, while four other songs, including the title track, were featured on the compilation cassette The Future Looks Bright Ahead, jointly issued by Posh Boy and SST in 1981. \"Boiling\" and \"Games\" were featured on the seminal SST compilation The Blasting Concept."@en ;

Composed primarily of pop standards such as \"Ol' Man River\" and \"For Once in My Life\" (later a major hit for Motown labelmate Stevie Wonder), and similar songs written by Holland-Dozier-Holland and other Motown staff songwriters, the Mellow Mood album was part of Motown chief Berry Gordy's crossover plans for the group. Gordy wanted the Temptations, already the most popular male group among black audiences, to attract a large white fanbase and be able to secure playdates at supper clubs like the Copacabana, where the group had first performed in the summer of 1967. The Temptations themselves, and Paul Williams in particular, were worried about appearing as sell-outs to their black fans and the radio DJs who had made them popular in the first place. However, both pop and soul fans responded to the Mellow Mood album, and the Temptations reached Gordy's desired goal of crossing over to white audiences. \"Ol' Man River\" was already present in the Temptations' performance repertoire as bass Melvin Franklin's solo spot, and \"For Once in My Life\" soon became a solo showcase for Williams, who performed a particularly acclaimed version of the song for the TCB television special in late 1968.

It was an ambitious release for the label, which was still in its early stages, and proved to be a success by selling over 70,000 copies. It was followed by an equally successful sequel, Before You Were Punk 2, in 1999. Because Vagrant Records did not yet have an extensive roster of artists, the compilation relied mostly on contributions from bands on other record labels. Only Face to Face and Automatic 7 had previously released records through Vagrant. By contrast, Before You Were Punk 2 would feature more bands that had signed to the label between 1997 and 1999."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Big Swing Face is the eighth album by American singer and pianist Bruce Hornsby. It was Hornsby's first studio album with his touring band, the Noisemakers. The album was Hornsby's most experimental effort to date; the only album on which Hornsby barely plays any piano, it relied heavily on post-electronica beats, drum loops, Pro Tools editing, and dense synthesizer arrangements. The album also boasts a \"stream-of-consciousness wordplay\" of lyrics that are in many ways more eccentric and humorous than previous work. The jazz fusion jam on \"Cartoons & Candy\" and the gesture towards Hornsby's jam band influence with Steve Kimock's extended guitar solo on \"The Chill\" highlighted some of the album's only familiar territory, and Hornsby cites the opening track, \"Sticks and Stones,\" as his partial homage to Radiohead's \"Everything in its Right Place.\" Big Swing Face received mixed reviews, ranging from \"a new and improved Bruce Hornsby\" to feeling as if \"someone else is singing\", to the album being called one of the \"strangest records of 2002\". Album sales were not helped by poor promotion from RCA, perhaps prompting Hornsby's decision to leave the label."@en ;

The EP was first released in July 1997, on 10\" vinyl, and featured three Acid King songs. The EP was reissued a month later on CD, as a split release with Altamont. This CD features the three Acid King songs, in addition to six Altamont songs. The Altamont portion is entitled Wanted Dead or Alive. It was released while Acid King frontwoman Lori S. and Altamont frontman Dale Crover were married. The cover artwork features a topless girl playing air guitar with a pentagram drawn across her chest. The identity of the girl was often thought to be Acid King's frontwoman Lori S., however, in an interview she revealed this to be untrue, and revealed its origin: \"Actually, I have this Jimi Hendrix poster in my rehearsal space with him playing guitar like that and the logo in the same typeface...\" Down with the Crown is the only release to feature Dan Southwick performing bass for Acid King."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"El Momento Descuidado (a Spanish rendering of \"The Unguarded Moment\") is the eighteenth album by the Australian psychedelic rock band The Church, released in November 2004. The album followed the outtakes compilation Beside Yourself by only a month. This time, the band decided to revisit past material in an all-acoustic setting, along with five new songs. For the first time in years, they performed \"The Unguarded Moment\" (albeit in strongly modified form), an early hit from which they had long distanced themselves. As a nod to the song's reappearance, they titled the album El Momento Descuidado - a rough Spanish translation of its name. A short all-acoustic tour followed the release in late 2004. The album was nominated for an 2005 ARIA Music Award for Best Adult Contemporary album, but it lost to The Go-Between's Oceans Apart. James Christoper Monger at AllMusic praised the album's \"intimacy and intensity\", stating that \"for musicians who have made a career out of dreamy, reverb-drenched landscapes ... that they've finally reduced these songs to the point of clarity is both triumphant and long overdue.\""@en ;

Copies purchased from Walmart also contain a DVD featuring Beyonc\u00E9's concert and television performances and behind-the-scenes footage.

Irreemplazable peaked at number 105 on the Billboard 200, and has sold 57,000 copies in the United States.

	dbo:abstract	"Neroli is an instrumental album by British musician Brian Eno, released in 1993. Conceived as a single piece, Eno describes it in the liner notes as \"to reward attention, but not so strict as to demand it\". Single notes resonate throughout the piece in a seemingly random but harmonic pattern that shifts quietly for close to an hour. Thanks to the calming nature of the piece, Neroli has been implemented in some maternity wards, both to instill a sense of calm as well as enhance the organic nature of childbirth. According to the notes accompanying the CD, Eno intended to release a longer version for just that purpose."@en ;

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nina_Live!>	rdf:type	schema:MusicAlbum ;
	dbo:abstract	"Nina Live! is a live album and the third album by Filipino singer Nina, released in the Philippines on February 23, 2005 by Warner Music. The original release date for the album was scheduled on February 22, 2005, but it was moved a day later due to preparation. Nina has released two successful studio albums that are both influenced by pop-R&B, but behind all the commercial activities, she regularly performs on different bars and gigs. The label wanted to show this side of the singer the best way by releasing a live album. The album consists of love songs from the 1970s to the 1990s, all of which she has covered live. The live session was recorded on January 30, 2005 at PHI Resto & Bar in Metro Manila. Nina Live! marked the last project that Nina has worked with Warner executive Ricky Ilacad, since he later moved to MCA Records. The live video recording was directed by Marla Ancheta, whom she described as a young, fun person to work with. Nina and The Essence band only had a two-week rehearsal before the video shoot, since they were already familiar with the songs. During the project, she collaborated with her Warner labelmates Christian Bautista, Thor and Trapp of Dice & K9. The songs that were chosen for the track list are the most-requested by fans and listeners. One song that was personally insisted by Nina made it to the final cut. On January 15, 2007, it was made available on digital download through iTunes and Amazon.com MP3 Download. Upon release, the album received generally favorable reviews. While praising the vocal ability and range of Nina, most critics did not like the idea of doing covers, believing that she has enough talent to release originals. Surprisingly, the album was a huge commercial success. After a week of commercial release, the album immediately reached gold status by the Philippine Association of the Record Industry (PARI), and certified platinum after three weeks. It is considered to be the biggest-selling album by a female artist in the Philippines, certifying 10\u00D7 Platinum (Diamond) by the PARI, a rare feat during the turn of the new millennium, where fewer people are purchasing compact discs and cassette tapes. It is the fourth biggest-selling album of an OPM artist, only behind Eraserheads' Cutterpillow (10\u00D7 Platinum) and Jose Mari Chan's Christmas in Our Hearts and Constant Change (both 20\u00D7 Platinum). Five successful commercial singles were released from the album. \"I Don't Want to Be Your Friend\" was released prior to the album, as part of Diane Warren's love songs compilation. The first single from the live recording is \"Love Moves in Mysterious Ways\", originally recorded by Julia Fordham. The song remains as one of the most successful singles of the 2000s, staying at number one for twelve consecutive weeks. It has, since, been linked to Nina, even though it was only a cover. \"Through the Fire\" was later released. The song is popular for her vocal belts, reaching G\u266F5 in full chest voice. \"Constantly\" is the fourth single and it also performed well on charts. \"I Love You Goodbye\" was released as the final single from the album. Warner made an official music video for the song, instead of distributing the live performance on TV stations."@en ;

This album was originally planned to be their debut album before getting shelved, making (Pronounced 'L\u0115h-'n\u00E9rd 'Skin-'n\u00E9rd) their actual debut.

It is considered an essential album by most fans of the band,[according to whom?] as the tracks are either not available on other albums, and later with the 1998 re-release, contains original versions of re-recorded songs that are on the other studio albums,[clarification needed] which are now all on one album. However a few of these early tracks were later released on compilation albums such as Best of the Rest in 1982 (1990 on CD) and again on the German-based Repertoire Records release Old Time Greats in 1997."@en ;

The album blended instrumental tracks with the story-telling, rock, jazz, and other musical forms Hornsby had delved into over his career. Over the two discs, Hornsby wove a tapestry of varied textures, from the fervent spirituality and almost gospel dirge of \"Preacher in the Ring, parts I & II,\" to the catchy chord progressions of \"Sad Moon.\" Spirit Trail has been often mentioned to be one of Bruce Hornsby's best albums. Several tracks, notably \"Fortunate Son\", have since become fan favorites and staples at Hornsby's concerts. Among other homages, the song \"Sunflower Cat (Some Dour Cat) (Down With That)\" sampled and looped the main lick from the Grateful Dead song \"China Cat Sunflower.\" Spirit Trail considered \"very Southern\" themes with \"songs about race, religion, judgment and tolerance\" and \"struggles with these issues\"\u2014notably on \"Sneaking Up on Boo Radley,\" which references the character from Harper Lee's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel To Kill a Mockingbird."@en ;

It comprises recordings from sessions for Blue Note and United Artists Records as a sideman for Paul Chambers, Sonny Clark, Johnny Griffin, and Cecil Taylor that were issued respectively on their Whims of Chambers, Sonny's Crib, A Blowin' Session, and Hard Driving Jazz albums. Two selections are from Coltrane's own 1957 Blue Train, and \"One for Four\" had been previously unissued. \"Trane's Blues\" had been issued on the compilation High Step in 1975, previously known as \"John Paul Jones\" and named after himself, the bass player Chambers, and the drummer Philly Joe Jones. Like Prestige Records before them, as Coltrane's fame grew long after he had stopped recording for the label, Blue Note used varied recordings, often those where Coltrane had been merely a sideman, and reissued them as a new album with Coltrane's name prominently displayed. In this case, the Big Four conglomerate EMI continued that earlier practice."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Oneiric is the debut album by electronic musician Boxcutter (Barry Lynn). The word oneiric means \"of or pertaining to dreams; resembling a dream, dreamlike\". This release established Boxcutter's experimental breaks and bass-driven style of music, which at first appraisal was labeled as dubstep because of its similar 2-step rhythms and warped basslines. However, comparisons were also drawn to IDM in that most tracks featured heavy use of effects and processed samples of live instrumentation. \"Tauhid\", for instance, begins with a distorted flute sample that intercuts throughout the track, while \"Sunshine V.I.P.\" features choppy, rapid-fire beat sequencing sourced from live drums in addition to a flute melody. Lynn says of his approach to musicmaking: The track \"Hyloz\" was used in Amon Tobin's live mix set during his Foley Room tour in 2007, though it is mistakenly listed as \"Grub\" on the subsequent release."@en ;

However, the band was unable to find enough Japanese women willing to undress for the cover, so some of the women are just made to look Japanese. The reason behind the album was that since the band was also famous outside German speaking countries, they wanted everybody to understand what they have to say.

Among notable songs were \"Something in the Air\"/\"The Revolution Will Not Be Televised\", in which all three bandmates: Patti LaBelle, Nona Hendryx and Sarah Dash each shared a rap, the biographical \"(Can I Speak to You Before You Go to) Hollywood\", which was inspired by the events following former member Cindy Birdsong ditching the group during its Blue Belles tenure to join The Supremes and which featured all three members having notable lead vocal parts, mainly from Dash, while Hendryx sung in the beginning and Patti LaBelle sang the following verses, the soulful ballad \"Last Dance\" and the bossa nova-inspired \"Let Me See You in the Light\". Despite RCA releasing the Stevie Wonder composition, \"Open Your Heart\", the album failed to become a success. In spite of its initial failure, the album has gone on to become a cult classic and is considered a revolutionary album because few female groups talked so openly about social issues and other topics."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"John B. Sebastian is the debut album by American singer/songwriter John Sebastian, previously best known as the co-founder and primary singer/songwriter of the 1960s folk-rock band the Lovin' Spoonful. The album, released in January 1970 (see 1970 in music), includes several songs that would become staples of Sebastian's live performances during the early and mid-1970s. Most notably, the album included \"She's a Lady\", Sebastian's first solo single (released in December 1968), and an alternate version of \"I Had a Dream\" which was used to open the soundtrack album of the 1970 documentary film Woodstock. John B. Sebastian also featured support performances by David Crosby, Stephen Stills and Graham Nash several months before that trio agreed to work together as a performing unit. The album's release was marred by legal controversy, with two record companies, Reprise and MGM, claiming ownership of the recording and simultaneously distributing the album (with different cover artwork as illustrated, but essentially identical content) for several months in 1970. Reprise, with whom Sebastian signed as a solo artist in 1969, ultimately sued MGM, Sebastian's former distributor, for copyright infringement to settle the dispute, with the MGM release of the album subsequently withdrawn from the market. John B. Sebastian would be the artist's most successful solo album, ultimately peaking at #20 on the U.S. Billboard pop albums chart."@en ;

The album was recorded at Columbia Recording Studios in New York and Hollywood. These sessions found a 21-year-old Aretha Franklin recording Jazz Music and Pop Music standards, from Johnny Mercer to Duke Ellington. She is backed by the arrangements of Columbia producer Robert Mersey. One of the most popular songs from the album is Aretha's interpretation of the classic \"Skylark\". A minute and fifty eight seconds into the song, Aretha sings the word \"Skylark\" with power and emotion. This was one of the first times in which Aretha recorded one of her written compositions, \"I Wonder (Where Are You Tonight)\", on an album. Though somewhat overlooked in her Columbia catalog, this album was jointly re-released with The Electrifying Aretha Franklin in June 2008."@en ;

The US tour for Gimme Some was notable for being characterised by free food being provided at each show by a catering company local to the city the band were playing at, tying in with some lyrics and themes of the album's main thematic song \"Down Like Me\". Live performances from this era were characterised by a back-to-basic, punk-like energy that came as a result of an effort by the band to revert to a more stripped-down sound after the electronic, layered compositions of their previous album Living Thing. Three singles were released from the album: \"Breaker Breaker\", \"Second Chance\", and \"Dig a Little Deeper\". \"May Seem Macabre\" was also promoted for radio circulation. The band also created a music video in collaboration with Pitchfork.TV of the entire album."@en ;

Last Patrol sold around 2,300 copies in the United States in its first week of release, peaking at no. 188 on the Billboard Top 200. Dave Wyndorf describes the album as \"a return to our roots in terms of vibe and recording style. It's full-on psychedelic space-rock with a '60s garage feel, recorded almost exclusively with vintage guitars, amps and effects in our hometown of Red Bank, New Jersey. The songs are a kind of space-noir, tales of cosmic revenge, peaking libidos, alienation and epic strangeness. It's a weird trip through the back alleys of a dark, retro-future, which not by coincidence very much resembles my own life. [laughs] The lyrics aren't fantasy really, rather a recounting of my musings on, observations of and general emotional reaction to my life and environment during a 1 week writing period in February of 2013. But I tend to use the vernacular and imagery of science fiction and surrealism to express myself and that's where these lyrics get trippy. There's also our cover version of Donovan's 'Three Kingfishers', which I thought fit the mood of the album.\" The band would perform the entire album for each show of the European leg in January and February 2014."@en ;

Currently, four singles have been produced; \"Ambiguous\", \"Grilletto\", \"BLAZING\" and \"PRIDE\".

	dbo:abstract	"Sakanaction (stylized as sakanaction) is the sixth studio album by Japanese band Sakanaction, released on March 13, 2013. Primarily created in recording sessions that began in September 2012 and lasted approximately four months, the album was recorded at the home of band's vocalist and songwriter, Ichiro Yamaguchi. In order to reach an audience, the band challenged themselves by creating music for commercial tie-ups and television dramas. Prior to the album, the band released three singles: two acting as theme songs for Japanese television dramas and another used in a commercial campaign for the design school Mode Gakuen. Theming the album around the concept of a M\u00F6bius strip, the band separated their music into two different types: external-facing songs meant for a wide audience, and internal-facing, created as a reflection of their personal musical tastes. The theme represented the band's efforts in attempting to bridge the gap between these two song types. Yamaguchi classified each song on the album as either external or internal, except for the album's preceding single \"Music\", which he saw as both. The album featured a strong dance sound, influenced by the band members' current musical tastes. Electronic musician Aoki Takamasa, who had previously created remixes for the band, collaborated with Sakanaction on the primarily instrumental songs \"Structure\" and \"Inori\". The album was primarily promoted during its release by two songs: \"Aoi\", an \"external\" song commissioned for NHK's 2013 soccer broadcasts that was promoted on radio and released exclusively on iTunes two weeks before the album, and \"Inori\", an \"internal\" song that was promoted with a music video and was released as the Inori EP, a vinyl exclusive release on June 26, 2013. From March to June 2013, the band promoted the album with the Sakanaquarium 2013 tour, including their first solely-billed concert in Taiwan. The album was their first release to debut at number one on the Japanese Oricon albums chart, and was also certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of Japan during its first month. As of 2016, the album is the band's most commercially successful release. Critics were positive about the album, praising Sakanaction's stronger dance sound, however were either disappointed that there was not a greater change, or were alienated by the \"internal\" songs. The album was chosen as one of the general award-receiving albums for the 2014 CD Shop Awards, however did not receive one of the major awards."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Cochin Moon (\u30B3\u30C1\u30F3\u306E\u6708 Kochin no Tsuki) is Haruomi Hosono's fifth solo album. Initially intended as a collaboration with illustrator Tadanori Yokoo, who traveled to India alongside Hosono (as part of a group) for inspiration; Yokoo ended up only drawing the cover, having been the worst victim of an outburst of severe diarrhea amongst the group during the trip, rendering this as a Hosono solo album. Cochin Moon was conceptually written as the soundtrack of a non-existent Bollywood film, a trait inspired by the artists' trip. The album includes performances by Tin Pan Alley keyboardist Hiroshi Sat\u014D and Yellow Magic Orchestra members Ryuichi Sakamoto & Hideki Matsutake. Despite being Hosono's first completely electronic solo album (at the time YMO's debut was still being recorded, making this Hosono's first electronic album to be released), the exotica feel of Hosono's previous solo work is still present. The first half of the album (named after an Indian hotel that the group was in for the trip, a picture of the hotel's front appears in the back of the album's packaging) consists of three thematically themed songs, the second half of the album (and Hosono's keyboard performance) is credited to \"Shuka Nishihara\" (\u897F\u539F\u6731\u590F), a pseudonym Hosono created as a play on Hakush\u016B Kitahara's pseudonym."@en ;

The recording is centered on Charles Ives' art song arranged for 17 piece jazz orchestra by composer Jack Cooper; this is a Third stream approach to jazz made more widely know by earlier band leaders and composers such as Paul Whiteman, Gunther Schuller, George Russell and Don Sebesky. Noted Ives scholar Gayle Magee writes,\"These recordings preserve the essence of (Ives) classics...while offering a fresh, modern reinterpretation for Ives fans and jazz enthusiasts alike.\" The album was named as one of the Top 10 Jazz CDs for 2014 in the Chicago Tribune by music critic Howard Reich and also peaked at #8 in radio airplay in the Roots Music Report for top albums in Canada for October 26, 2014. Reich comments about the CD, \"Can the gnarly, rhythmically complex, densely scored works of Ives be transformed (sic)? ...arranger Cooper accomplishes it brilliantly, applying a jazz aesthetic to Ives classics...\""@en ;

In support of its release, Lush toured with Pale Saints and Loop, performing a dozen dates on the UK university circuit.

After the enormous success of In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida, Iron Butterfly modified its acid-rock sound somewhat and experimented with more melodic compositions. The band's trademark heavy guitars, however, are still evident on such tracks as \"In the Time of Our Lives\" and \"It Must Be Love\". The album reached #3 in the charts, making Ball more immediately successful than In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida. Ball was certified Gold in March 1969. It also spawned two minor hit singles: \"Soul Experience\", an uncharacteristically uplifting song for the group, went to #75 on the Billboard charts, and despite its nightmarish musical tones and morbid lyrics, \"In the Time of Our Lives\" managed to reach #96. This is the second and final studio album to feature the famous lineup of Ingle, Bushy, Dorman and Brann. In 1999, Collector's Choice Music released Ball with two bonus tracks, \"I Can't Help But Deceive You Little Girl\" and \"To Be Alone\", which previously were available only on a 7\" single although \"I Can't Help But Deceive You Little Girl\" had been released on the 1993 compilation Light And Heavy."@en ;

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Best_Of_(Vanilla_Ninja_album)>	rdf:type	schema:MusicAlbum ;
	dbo:abstract	"Best Of is a best-of album by the Estonian girl band Vanilla Ninja. The album was released in December 2005 and consists of thirteen songs from their Traces of Sadness and Blue Tattoo albums. The album was released in several countries in Central Europe, failing to make the top 100 in Germany and Austria, and peaking at #70 in Switzerland. The album also ended their run of three straight album chart number ones in Estonia, failing to chart there also. Best Of was a controversial album because the group had left Bros Records when it was released by the label. It was released without consulting the girls, who were unaware that the album existed until it was released. Best Of is generally considered a money-making venture on the part of their former manager David Brandes, who has been widely reported as by then having an unpleasant relationship with the group. In interviews during the weeks around the album's release, Vanilla Ninja member Piret J\u00E4rvis asked fans to not buy the album, as it would be supporting the Bros label. With the high-profile nature of the interviews, especially in Estonia, the album's sales and chart positions were probably lower than expected. The album was, as the name suggests, essentially a greatest hits album of the group's releases since from their 2004 international breakthrough. The album contained no new material, with the tracks recorded between late 2003 and early 2005. Included on the album were most of their singles, including \"Tough Enough\", \"When The Indians Cry\", \"I Know\" and their Eurovision Song Contest 2005 song \"Cool Vibes\". No tracks from their first album, Vanilla Ninja, were included, almost certainly because this was released by TopTen and not Bros Records. This meant that their first single, \"Club Kung Fu\", was missing. The album was generally criticised by critics, mostly because the girls' career was not long enough to warrant a \"Best Of\" album. Notably, the album cover for Best Of showed the original Vanilla Ninja line-up, with Maarja Kivi shown instead of Triinu Kivilaan, despite her leaving the group in mid-2004. This was probably because Kivi was signed to Bros as solo artist, with her inclusion on the cover helping to promote her then-upcoming single \"Could You\"."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Cycles is the tenth studio album by American rock band The Doobie Brothers, released in 1989 (see 1989 in music). It marked the band's reunion after breaking up in 1982. Instead of the later configurations with Michael McDonald at the helm, the band reverted to the their 1972-4 lineup although Bobby LaKind who had played percussion with later configurations also rejoined. Tom Johnston, John Hartman and Michael Hossack returned to the studio lineup for the first time since 1977, 1978 and 1974 respectively. The album was largely co-written with producers and sidesmen. Bobby LaKind collaborated with former Doobie members John McFee and Keith Knudsen on Time is Here and Gone and Michael McDonald on Tonight I'm Coming Through (The Border). Two cover versions were included in the form of the Four Tops' One Chain (Don't Make No Prison) and the Isley Brothers' Need a Little Taste of Love . Lead track The Doctor was released as a single and stormed to No 9 on Billboard's Hot 100 and No 1 on the Mainstream Rock Chart. After this album, Bobby Lakind quit the band, forced into retirement by terminal cancer which claimed his life in 1992. The album was reissued in 2002 by One Way Records with two bonus tracks. The first \"Anything for Love\" was written by Bobby LaKind with Eddie Schwartz and Zeke Zirngiebel, the second was an expanded version of Need A Little Taste of Love that was included on the original album."@en ;

dbr:Damage_Done	rdf:type	schema:MusicAlbum ;
	dbo:abstract	"Damage Done is the sixth full-length studio album by the Swedish melodic death metal band Dark Tranquillity. Here, the band returns to a more classic style while holding the new changes made in their albums Haven and Projector, especially in the keyboards, but this is the first record since \"Projector\" that does not feature clean vocals. Martin Henriksson started doing some \"lead guitar riffs\" on the record, so the band showed influences from The Gallery in the duality of lead guitars. Mikael Stanne said that the lyrics on this album are about the frailty of life. A video was recorded for the song \"Monochromatic Stains\". It was done in a monochromatic format and bears visual and thematic resemblance to the film The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari. The video was made by Achilleas Gatsopoulos. The Agonist recorded a cover version of the song, released as a track on Century Media: Covering 20 Years of Extremes. The song \"Cathode Ray Sunshine\" is featured in the video game's soundtrack, Br\u00FCtal Legend. Several versions of the album feature a bonus track entitled \"I, Deception\" as well as the \"Monochromatic Stains\" video clip but it is known that the limited edition digipak contains them.The Japanese version of the album features the bonus track, \"The Poison Well\". The vinyl release includes \"I, Deception\" and also has different cover art. The 2009 reissue includes bonus tracks and digitally remastered audio."@en ;

It contains either released or (previously) unreleased songs from 1981 through to 1984, as well as some remixes of those songs (roughly half of the album by time is made up of remixes of songs also on the album). The album is thus similar to the 1987 compilation album Twelve Inch Singles and contains much of the same material. Most of the songs on the album were initially released on the Wax Trax! label. As can be expected from Ministry's early work, the album features a strong synthpop and new wave flavor - Ministry moved more definitively into the industrial metal genre later into their career (post Twitch). The album also shows Ministry's early gothic rock beginnings, with the two mixes of \"I'm Falling\" and \"Overkill\" being some of their earliest tracks."@en ;

The album received positive reviews from critics, with most noting that its speed and the brevity of most of the songs necessitated repeat listens in order to notice its more intricate qualities. Bryne Yancey of Punknews.org remarked that \"there's so much going on underneath the surface of these songs that once all the intricacies hit your ears, it might cause you to wonder aloud if anyone else who's not in the band notices them. Sure, anyone can listen to the Marked Men, but to hear them is a completely different experience.\" Luke Jackson of Alternative Press noted \"To be perfectly honest, Ghosts won't grab you at first. Sure, they're a band playing loud, fast, and exceptionally tight, but the pop-punk market has been so oversaturated that it takes a lot for a band like Marked Men to be anything but white noise.

The album includes a collection of songs that vary in style and genre. Released the same day as the recording of Elvis: As Recorded Live On Stage In Memphis was being made, the title was taken from the song \"Talk About the Good Times\". Many of the songs are covers of hits at the time, like \"Spanish Eyes\" and \"She Wears My Ring\". Charting low at the time of its release, it was considered typical 1970s Elvis material and was his first album to hit the \"cut-out bins\". The album did have some success though upon its original release, becoming a Cashbox #1 hit and charting in the Top 50 in the UK. Original copies of the LP with the sticker on the cover (stating the singles on the album) are very rare and sell for large amounts on auction sites. The album released two singles, both hits: \"I've Got a Thing About You Baby\" rose to #4 on the Country charts, #39 pop; \"My Boy\" hit #1 on the Adult Contemporary charts, as well as #14 Country and #20 Pop."@en ;

It contained the No. 1 singles \"I'll Make Love To You\" and \"On Bended Knee\", the latter of which replaced the former at the top of the Billboard Hot 100, making the group the third artist to replace themselves at No. 1 in the United States after Elvis Presley and The Beatles and the first to achieve the feat in 30 years. \"I'll Make Love to You\" also spent 14 weeks at the top of the Hot 100 making them the first artist to achieve consecutive double digit runs at the top, with their prior single \"End of the Road\" topping the charts for 13 weeks and also equaled the record set by Whitney Houston's \"I Will Always Love You\" for the longest run at the top, a record which they held previously with \"End of the Road\". Other singles released achieved major success, including \"Water Runs Dry\", which reached No. 2, and \"Thank You\", which reached No. 21. \"Vibin'\", however, only reached No. 52. The spoken track \"Khalil (Interlude)\" is a tribute to their road manager Khalil Roundtree who was shot in Chicago, Illinois while the band was opening for MC Hammer's Too Legit to Quit tour. II became the inaugural winner of the Grammy Award for Best R&B Album, first presented at the 37th Grammy Awards in 1995. According to producer Bob Robinson of the duo Tim & Bob, he and his partner Tim Kelley were asked by Boyz II Men to produce most of II. However, Motown Records then-president Jheryl Busby didn't feel comfortable with the idea of two unknown producers dominating a second album from a group that was one of the biggest acts in the world at the time. As a result, Busby brought in Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis and Babyface to deliver hit singles for the project. Busby insisted on \"I'll Make Love to You\" being the first single, despite objections from the group- who felt there were songs that could have been much stronger singles. Ironically, the song went on to become one of Boyz II Men's biggest hits. Over 20 songs were recorded for II, but most of them never made the final tracklisting. Two of the songs Tim & Bob produced - \"Now That We're Done\" and \"Can I Touch You\" - ended up on 112's 1996 self-titled debut."@en ;

The album was originally going to be named Hyperspace, but vocalist Johnny Gioeli decided to change the name simply to II because \"it's a natural prosecution of what we started with our debut album Double Eclipse.\"[citation needed] The tracks \"Face the Night,\" \"Do or Die,\" \"Your Eyes,\" and \"This Gift\" were originally recorded for Double Eclipse, as Johnny Gioeli revealed in a 2002 interview, \"So people are getting a real Hardline record.\" It features former The Storm guitarist Josh Ramos. In a 2002 interview with Andy Read, Johnny Gioeli revealed four songs that were to be included on II: \"Plastic Jesus,\" \"Sweet Surrender,\" \"Why Me,\" which may have been an early demo of \"Y,\" and \"Only a Night,\" the only track among the four confirmed to have appeared on the final product. Gioeli also revealed that he had written two full-length albums, one of which was unused and replaced with what became II. \"We actually started writing an album that would've truly been a follow-up to the first Hardline record,\" Gioeli explained, \"It would have been a bit shocking because it was a little outside the box. People don't know that because the second album never came out. Anyway, people at Frontiers heard it and got a little bit nervous and said, 'Keep it like the first record.'\" In an interview with members of Jun Senoue's official fansite at Summer of Sonic 2012, Gioeli elaborated on the differences between Double Eclipse and what would have been an immediate follow up: \"So the question is, how different was it going to be? Well, what happened was, we had a meeting with the record company (MCA Records) when we were preparing for that, and then, you know the whole Pearl Jam alternative shit was happening, and the record company said 'Hey look, we know that you guys are talented enough that you can fit in this space as well. So we want to have a bit of an alternative flare.' So, was it completely different? No, but it definitely had a little alternative feel to it. Yeah, it definitely did. I\u2019m trying to recall... basically the difference was, what was happening is a lot of the singers were not using much vibrato.\" He then demonstrated the difference. \"So what we were doing was...\" He proceeded to sing part of \u201CI Will Survive\u201D (unreleased) without vibrato. \"There it is, that was one of the songs.\""@en ;

The album had to be re-recorded from scratch after lead singer Philip Ekstr\u00F6m stated on the band's official website, \"...I basically lost every song I've ever recorded with The Mary Onettes. My hard drive with all my music was stolen in my car one fine afternoon in Stockholm, the very same fine afternoon we came home from our US tour, the very same day I was feeling thrilled to come home and start the process of finishing our new album. Of course I had made a backup copy on my computer at home. But for some reason a power failure in the building made that hard drive collapse too. Unbelievable. I was speechless for days.\" The band played the Primavera Sound Festival in Spain in May 2008, and reconvened in the studio to start the recording process again in September. The band's Dare EP was released in April 2009, intended as a sampler of the Islands album. It featured two album tracks (\"Dare\" and \"God Knows I Had Plans\") and an exclusive non-album track (\"Kicks\"). Ekstr\u00F6m said of the album's name: \"The title Islands came up because I see the tracks on the album as small islands in different shapes and forms where every song is like a record of it's [sic] very own. Johan on Labrador Records suggested the same title without having heard me mentioning the idea, so that was a coincidence too good not to pursue. The songs are almost too personal and I've had a hard time playing them for friends. It's like all I want to do is keep them to myself.\""@en ;

The album marked the end of Aretha's 12-year tenure with Atlantic and a run of 19 original albums. The album was a commercial flop as the singer attempted to make a comeback by recording a disco-oriented project with producer Van McCoy. It was McCoy's final work as he died in June of that year and the record was released as disco was running its course. It peaked at #146 on Billboard's album chart and sold less than 75,000 copies in the United States. It stands as the lowest charting and poorest selling album of Aretha's entire Atlantic Records catalogue. \"Ladies Only\" only reached #33 on Billboard's R&B singles chart while the follow-up, \"Half A Love\", stalled at #65. This album was recorded at Aretha's vocal peak and features three of her own compositions, as well as a song by her eldest son Clarence Franklin. Although remembered as Aretha's failed disco LP, La Diva also includes substantial funk/ R&B tracks such as The Emotions' \"Reasons Why\", Zulema's \"Half a Love\" and scorching versions of Lalome Washburn's \"It's Gonna Get A Bit Better\" and her own \"Honey I Need Your Love.\" This album has not been officially released on compact disc."@en ;

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/MTV_Unplugged_(Alanis_Morissette_album)>	rdf:type	schema:MusicAlbum ;
	dbo:abstract	"MTV Unplugged is the first live album by Canadian singer-songwriter Alanis Morissette, released by Maverick Records in the United States on November 9, 1999 (see 1999 in music). It comprises songs performed by Morissette on the television program MTV Unplugged. Twelve tracks were included on the album, but Morissette performed several others, including \"Baba\", \"Thank U\" (both from 1998's Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie) and \"Your House\" (the hidden track on 1995's Jagged Little Pill), during her Unplugged concert. These were later released as B-sides on the \"King of Pain\" single release. The first single, \"That I Would Be Good\", was moderately successful, and two other tracks, \"King of Pain\" (a cover of the song by The Police) and \"You Learn\" were released as singles outside North America. As of March 2012, the album has sold 673,000 copies in the U.S. In addition to material from Morissette's first two U.S. albums, MTV Unplugged featured performances of \"No Pressure over Cappuccino\" and \"Princes Familiar\", two previously unreleased songs from her tours, and \"These R the Thoughts\", a previously released b-side. Morissette has stated that \"Princes Familiar\" in particular is one of her favorite and most vocally challenging songs. She performed it on her 2005 Diamond Wink Tour, where she dedicated it to \"all of the dads in the audience.\" The ballad \"No Pressure over Cappuccino\", one of the first songs she wrote following the release of Jagged Little Pill, \"was inspired by [her] twin brother,\" Wade. Featuring cleaner vocals, slower arrangements and a few drastic reinventions (particularly in the case of \"You Oughta Know\"), MTV Unplugged foreshadowed much of Morissette's later, softer work, particularly 2005's Jagged Little Pill Acoustic and the accompanying Diamond Wink Tour. MTV Unplugged is Alanis's best-selling album in Brazil selling over 1 million copies."@en ;

Released in 1968, it was the first regular studio LP to display the new billing of the group formerly known as \"The Supremes.\" It contains the singles \"Reflections\", \"In and Out of Love\" and \"Forever Came Today\". Also included are covers of songs made famous by Martha and the Vandellas (\"Love (Makes Me Do Foolish Things)\") and The 5th Dimension (\"Up, Up and Away\"). Also present are songs written by other famous names, including \"Bah-Bah-Bah\" co-written by Motown singer Brenda Holloway with her younger sister, Patrice, an original Smokey Robinson composition titled \"Then\", and \"What the World Needs Now Is Love\" by Burt Bacharach and Hal David, which Motown planned to release as a single in the spring of 1968, but cancelled. It also contains a cover of Bobbie Gentry's \"Ode to Billie Joe,\" whose original recording kept the single #2 \"Reflections\" from peaking at the top spot on the Billboard Hot 100 in September 1967, and it hit #2 on Cashbox. The album includes the final songs the Supremes recorded with their main creative team of Holland\u2013Dozier\u2013Holland before the three writers/producers departed Motown over royalty and title disputes. Although Florence Ballard recorded some of this album before being fired from the group in July 1967, her replacement Cindy Birdsong along with Mary Wilson recorded several songs and appears on the album cover. One of the album's singles, \"Forever Came Today\", was later covered by The Jackson 5 on their 1975 album Moving Violation. \"In and Out of Love\" was chosen to be the key song for the American Bandstand dance contest that year. Because of that exposure, the single remained #1 on American Bandstand's chart for an impressive four weeks. It outperformed \"Reflections\" with Dick Clark's audience affording the album two top three singles on that pivotal show.[citation needed]"@en ;

Metheny left Burton's group in 1977 to form his own quartet with Lyle Mays. The two had virtually no contact with each other until, in early 1988, the organizers of the Montreal Jazz Festival contacted Burton. They told him that Metheny was the festival host, and invited Burton to join him onstage. \"My apprehension was immediately erased when I saw how easy it was for us to play together, even after 12 years,\" said Burton.
