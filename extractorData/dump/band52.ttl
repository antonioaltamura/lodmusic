Former member Lisa left the group in 2002 to pursue a solo career, and the remaining members then started the M-Flo Loves... project working different vocalists for each song over three albums, including the likes of Bonnie Pink, Koda Kumi and BoA. Their mainstream success and critical acclaim established them as the most iconic and influential hip-hop production team in Japan with success throughout Asia. Taku Takahashi and Verbal also started successful side-projects outside of M-Flo, such as the Teriyaki Boyz and Global Astro Alliance collaborating with international producers and artists such as Kanye West and the Beastie Boys. In 2008 the group announced a hiatus, stating that each member would be focusing on their respective side projects. In 2012 the group ended their hiatus with the release of Square One on March 14, 2012."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Man\u00E1 are a Mexican Pop band from Guadalajara, Jalisco. They are known as the U2 of Spanish rock. The group's current line-up consists of vocalist/guitarist Fher Olvera, drummer Alex \"El Animal\" Gonz\u00E1lez, guitarist Sergio Vall\u00EDn, and bassist Juan Calleros. Man\u00E1 has earned four Grammy Awards, eight Latin Grammy Awards, five MTV Video Music Awards Latin America, six Premios Juventud awards, nineteen Billboard Latin Music Awards and fifteen Premios Lo Nuestro awards. It is considered by many as the most influential and successful Latin American band of all time with over 40 million albums sold worldwide. Man\u00E1 has topped the all-time lists in much of Latin America and in their native Mexico, where they set landmarks in record sales and concert attendances. The band formed in 1986 and released its first album, Falta Amor, in 1990. In 1992, the group released \u00BFD\u00F3nde Jugar\u00E1n Los Ni\u00F1os?, which sold more than 10 million copies worldwide, (over 700,000 copies in the US alone) becoming the best selling Spanish-language rock album of all time. After several lineup changes, the group released Cuando los \u00C1ngeles Lloran (1995), which is noted for its stylistic departure from the band's previous work. Man\u00E1 followed with Sue\u00F1os L\u00EDquidos (1997), Revoluci\u00F3n de Amor (2002), and Amar es Combatir (2006), which continued the group's success. The band followed up with Drama y Luz in April 2011. Their most recent album is Cama Incendiada, which was released in early 2015. The band's sound draws from pop rock, Latin pop, calypso, reggae and ska music genres. They initially received international commercial success in Australia and Spain and have since gained popularity and exposure in the US, Western Europe, Asia, and the Middle East."@en ;

Their original hit songs were generated by Mombassa, O'Doherty, Plaza and Smith, either individually or collectively; they also hit the Australian charts with covers of songs by Roy Orbison, Elvis Presley and Chuck Berry. Their top ten Australian singles are \"If You Leave Me, Can I Come Too?\" and \"Too Many Times\" (both from 1981), \"Live It Up\" (1985) and \"Rock and Roll Music\" (1988). Internationally, \"Too Many Times\" made the Canadian top 40 in 1982, and \"Live It Up\" peaked at No. 3 in UK, No. 4 in Norway, and No. 6 in Germany, after it featured in the 1986 Australian film \"Crocodile\" Dundee. All of the early members are visual artists and have had combined studio displays, some have had solo studio displays with Mombassa's artwork also used as designs by the Mambo clothing company. The majority of the group's record covers, posters and video clips have been designed and created by themselves or their art school contemporaries.

The band was formed in 1988 and have sold over 11 million records over the course of their career, with the majority sold in Asia. Despite being Danish, the band performs songs in English. The band has attributed its success in Asia to their clean-living image and to singing in English as a second language. MLTR has earned Gold and Platinum status for records in many countries and won many awards, including the Gold Preis Award from RSH, Germany and \"The Best Performing Act of the Year\" at the SEA Grammy Awards in Singapore. In addition, their song \"Take Me To Your Heart\" was awarded \"most downloaded single of the year 2006\" had 6 million or more paid downloads. The band has recorded eight studio albums as well as a number of live and greatest hits albums. During the peak of their popularity in the mid-1990s, MLTR was described by critics as being \"as good (if not better) a band as any current big name group out of America or the UK.\" According to the band's record label releases, their sound is \"the perfect balance of a Scandinavian glow and the international pop song that has been instrumental in forming the compelling sound of the band\", although the lead singer and songwriter, Jascha Richter, disagrees with this, maintaining that the music defies geographical categorization."@en ;

Mokoma started out as a creation of Marko Annala, who is the band's lead singer, and has been the band's only original bandmember. The name comes from Annala's former girlfriends' Karelian grandmother, who said \"Voi siuta mokomaa\". That means \"Oh gosh, you and your tricks\", basically in simple words when put into English. Mokoma is similar but slightly more gracious word to \"damned\" or \"accursed\". Through the years several members have come and gone, but only Marko has remained constant. The band started out as a more traditional rock band with their first two albums \"Valu\" and \"Mokoman 120 p\u00E4iv\u00E4\u00E4\". However, both albums sold badly and they were eventually dropped when they suggested to their record company (EMI), that they wanted to play something more closer to their hearts, thrash metal. The group moved on and created their own record company, called Sakara Records, and released their third album \"Kurimus\", which is sometimes regarded as the first thrash metal album sung in Finnish. That was the first release of the members' independent record company Sakara Records. Since then they have released seven more albums and an EP called \"Viides vuodenaika\", which reached position one in the Finnish albums chart. Their latest album release is \"El\u00E4vien kirjoihin\"."@en ;

In fall 2004, Torsten Pr\u00F6frock became a member of Monolake. Monolake's minimal, dub-influenced techno music helped establish the sound of the Chain Reaction label, also located in Berlin, subsequently using their own [ml/i] (Monolake / Imbalance Computer Music) label for the group's output. Both current members have solo projects, with Henke releasing under his own name and Pr\u00F6frock as \"T++\" and \"Various Artists.\" In 2008 T++ followed Ricardo Villalobos in bridging the gap between minimal techno and dubstep, by remixing Shackleton's Death Is Not Final for the Skull Disco label. In 2009, Robert Henke appeared in the electronic music documentary Speaking In Code which presented the completion of the Monodeck. As of 2012, Henke has been designing a new form of live show syncing surround-sound audio stems with visual loops, allowing for improvisation.

Original singer Zak Ward switched to keyboards and samples in 2002 (while sometimes still providing additional vocals both live and in studio) and was replaced by Ivan \"Ghost\" Moody which led to the release of their first studio album Motograter in 2003. The band went on an indefinite hiatus in 2005, disbanded after playing a one-time reunion show in 2006, and then reformed with a new line-up in 2008, featuring singer Michael \"Angel\" Woodruff. They released the EP Pre-Release in 2009, and toured until the band's second split up in 2011. The band reunited again in late 2013, performing at Slipknot's Knotfest the next year.

After signing to major label ATO Records, the group released two albums, It Still Moves (2003) and Z (2005), with the latter representing a critical breakthrough. Their next release, Evil Urges (2008), was more polarizing for fans and critics, while Circuital (2011), their sixth album, saw a more measured response.

Initially called Hell's Half-Acre, the band's name comes from Ted Nugent's introduction to \"Wang Dang Sweet Poontang\" on the Double Live Gonzo album. Following the initial 1997 breakup of Kentucky cowpunk band Nine Pound Hammer, guitarist Blaine Cartwright formed Nashville Pussy where he would take up vocal duties in addition to guitar. The core lineup of Nashville Pussy consists of husband-and-wife duo Blaine Cartwright and Ruyter Suys (pronounced \"Rider Sighs\"), and drummer Jeremy Thompson. Original drummer Adam Neal (Nine Pound Hammer) left to form The Hookers. Original bassist Corey Parks (sister of former NBA basketball player Cherokee Parks) quit one month after the release of the album High as Hell, and later joined Die Hunns. Tracy Almazan aka Tracy Kickass formerly of NYC's The Wives, and Helldorado was enlisted to replace Parks mid-tour. Nashville Pussy recorded Say Something Nasty with Almazan on bass only to be replaced by Katielyn Campbell (of the band Famous Monsters). Katie Lynn's image is on the album Say Something Nasty. Campbell was subsequently replaced by Karen Cuda for the album Get Some. Karen Cuda also appeared as bassist on the album \"From Hell To Texas\", and in the live DVD Live in Hollywood.

This gives the band a tense and highly driven sub-hardcore sound featuring distorted effects-laden guitar and energetic drums. The band was formed while at sixth form college and they recorded their first album while some of the members were still teenagers. This led to a strong teenaged fanbase with a reputation for enjoying crowd surfing and moshing at their gigs. The band was also noted (and occasionally ridiculed) for their early image, which consisted of uniformly crimped hair and a predilection for sporting shorts and band or skateboard T-shirts. \"The Neds\" (as their fans referred to them) were well known for their own distinctive T-shirts, reportedly producing over 86 different designs within three years (1987\u20131990).

	dbo:abstract	"No Fun at All (often abbreviated to just NFAA) is a Swedish punk rock band. The band formed in the summer of 1991 in Skinnskatteberg. The group initially consisted of Mikael Danielsson (guitar), Henrik Sunvisson (bass guitar) and Jimmy Olsson (vocals, drums). The name was inspired by a tongue-in-cheek version of The Stooges' song \"No Fun\" as covered by the Sex Pistols, and the name of the band Sick of It All. The group released their albums on the Swedish label Burning Heart Records outside the United States. Within the U.S., No Fun at All's albums were released by Theologian Records and later by Epitaph Records. In 1993, Jimmy Olsson left the band to concentrate on his other band Sober. No Fun at All then recruited three new members in Ingemar Jansson (vocals), Krister Johansson (guitar) and Kjell Ramstedt (drums). In 1999, Sunvisson left No Fun at All. Danielsson switched from guitar to bass guitar and Stefan Neuman, from Tribulation, took up the vacant guitar slot. On November 11, 2001, after ten years together and over 250,000 album sales worldwide, No Fun at All decided to quits. Since 2004, No Fun at All has performed some reunion gigs. At the reunion show at the Groezrock Festival, No Fun at All announced that they would bring out a new album in the fall of 2008 through their own label Beat 'Em Down Records. On April 19, 2012 the Millencolin Festival announced that No Fun At All canceled their show at the festival due to their disbandment . As of May 2013, however, the band is active again and will be touring Australia in November of that year with Boysetsfire, Off with Their Heads and Jughead's Revenge."@en ;

Their sound genre mixes electronica with musical elements and instrumentation of Tambora and Norte\u00F1o music, resulting in the nortec (\"norte\u00F1o\" + \"techno\") style. The various projects began producing and performing Nortec music around 1999. In 2001, they were signed to a recording contract with Palm Pictures, that released their first album \"Tijuana Session Volume 1\" under the name Nortec Collective. The line-up for that album included Bostich, Clorofila, Fussible, Hiperboreal, Panoptica, Plankton Man and Terrestre. The latter two would leave Nortec Collective in 2002. Nortec Collective's second album, Tijuana Sessions, Vol. 3, (Nacional Records) received much critical praise and was nominated for two Latin Grammy awards in 2006. In 2008, Nortec Collective ceased to function as a proper collective, with the various individual projects performing and recording separately. According to the Collective's Myspace page, \"For the time being, Nortec Collective has decided to release music separately \u2026\" and \"Until further notice, there will be not be any bookings for Nortec, Nortec Collective or Colectivo Nortec with the full four member line-up.\" The various individual projects went on to release and perform separately. 2008's Tijuana Sound Machine by Bostich and Fussible (also Nacional Records) was nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Latin Rock/Alternative Album. The Nortec Collective has borrowed several elements of Banda music sub-culture and have used them both in their songs (Narcoteque, Almada) and in their visuals and album covers."@en ;

The name VIA Gra is both a reference to the drug Viagra and a play on words, since the first three letters stand for \"vocal-instrumental ensemble\" in Ukrainian, and \"hra\" means \"game\" in Ukrainian and it is also kind of a signature of the surnames of the two first girls of the group, VI-nnitskay-A and GRA-novskaya, the originally used maiden name of Nadya Meikher. Nu Virgos was a Ukrainian girl group that hit the charts in these countries in September 2000 with their first single \"Popytka No. 5\". Their first success outside the Russian language area was in May 2004 with the single \"Stop! Stop! Stop!\", an English version of their 2002 Russian song. The group is known for their frequent lineup changes, with 13 different individuals having at one time been in the group. The group was co-created by Dmitriy Kostyuk and Konstantin Meladze. Kostyuk is the manager of the group and the co-producer of the group's albums. Meladze is the writer of the group's songs and the co-producer of the group's albums."@en ;

Formed in Austin, Texas in 1998, the band takes its name from a short story by Russian author Tatyana Tolstaya set on the river in St Petersburg. They began as a trio made up of Sheff and friends he'd met in his native state of New Hampshire but, over time, have gone through many lineups. Okkervil River self-released their first album, Stars Too Small to Use, which led them to the South by Southwest music festival. After recording their first album in a garage, they signed with Jagjaguwar. They continued by releasing four more albums, including the critically lauded concept album Black Sheep Boy. After a period of touring for Black Sheep Boy, Okkervil River followed up with The Stage Names. The album sold 10,000 in its opening week in the United States. The group released a free covers album, Golden Opportunities Mixtape from their live performances. The band has garnered positive critical reception. They have appeared on the talk show Late Night with Conan O'Brien and have performed with acts such as The Decemberists, The New Pornographers, The National, and Lou Reed. Okkervil River released the album The Stand Ins on 9 September 2008. They promoted the release with a series of cover songs from the album on YouTube by people they've met as a band. Their 2010 collaboration as a backing band with psychedelic rocker Roky Erickson yielded True Love Cast Out All Evil. On 10 May 2011, Okkervil River released their sixth full-length album, I Am Very Far, which peaked at No. 32 on the Billboard 200. The band released their seventh album, The Silver Gymnasium, on 3 September 2013. The album peaked at No. 66 on the Billboard 200. The band\u2019s most recent album, Away, was released on September 9th, 2016 on ATO Records."@en ;

The band consists of Jared Leto (lead vocals, guitar, bass, keyboards), Shannon Leto (drums, percussion) and Tomo Mili\u010Devi\u0107 (lead guitar, bass, violin, keyboards, other instruments). The band's debut album, 30 Seconds to Mars (2002), was produced by Bob Ezrin and released to positive reviews but only to limited commercial success. The band achieved worldwide fame with the release of their second album A Beautiful Lie (2005), which received multiple certifications all over the world, including platinum in the United States. Their next release, This Is War (2009), showed a dramatic evolution in the band's musical style, as they incorporated experimental music as well as eclectic influences. The recording process of the album was marked by a legal dispute with record label EMI that eventually became the subject of the documentary film Artifact (2012). Thirty Seconds to Mars then moved to Universal Music and released the fourth album, Love, Lust, Faith and Dreams (2013), to critical and commercial success. As of September 2014, the band has sold over 15 million albums worldwide. Thirty Seconds to Mars has consistently enjoyed sold out tours and numerous headlining festival slots. The band is noted for its energetic live performances and for fusing many music genres. They have been compared to the sounds of bands such as Pink Floyd, The Cure, Tool, and U2, for their philosophical and spiritual lyrics, concept albums and their use of experimental music. Thirty Seconds to Mars has received several awards and accolades throughout their career, including a Guinness World Record, and has been included in the Kerrang! list of best artists of the 2000s."@en ;

Formed in 2000 by vocalist and guitarist Andrew Stockdale, bassist and keyboardist Chris Ross, and drummer Myles Heskett, the group currently includes Stockdale, bassist and keyboardist Ian Peres, and touring drummer Alex Carapetis. Wolfmother released their self-titled debut album Wolfmother in Australia in 2005, and internationally in 2006, which has since sold over 1.5 million copies worldwide and won the band a number of industry awards. Ross and Heskett left the band in 2008. Stockdale returned with a new lineup featuring Peres, rhythm guitarist Aidan Nemeth and drummer Dave Atkins in 2009, releasing Cosmic Egg later in the year. After more personnel changes, the group's planned third album was released in 2013 as Keep Moving, a Stockdale solo album. Later that year, Wolfmother returned as a trio featuring Peres and drummer Vin Steele for 2014's New Crown. The band's fourth album, Victorious, featured two guest drummers and was released in 2016. Wolfmother have been categorised by various commentators within the genres of hard rock, heavy metal, stoner rock and psychedelic rock. They are often compared to influential classic rock and metal bands from the 1960s and 1970s, including Led Zeppelin, Black Sabbath, Blue Cheer and AC/DC. Frontman Stockdale has typically led songwriting for the group, although the material on the band's debut album was co-credited to Ross and Heskett.

	dbo:abstract	"XP8 was an Italian electronic group. The band started in 2001 as a trio, composed of Marco Visconti, Marko Resurreccion, and singer Paul Toohill. The group self-released an album, Forgive on MP3.com. When they signed to the Polish label Black Flames Records, their album was released as Forgive[n] in May 2004. An EP of new material, RE_Productions, was released five months later. In 2005, the band released their second album, Hrs:Min:Sec, on the German label Infacted Recordings. Toohill left the band in 2007, to work on his solo project, Generator. He is also the main singer for a Nitzer Ebb tribute band called \"Muscle And Hate\". Their third album, The Art of Revenge, was released in January 2008 on Infacted. It was also licensed to Sigsaly Transmissions for North America and Gravitator Records for Russia the same year. A music video, the band's first, was produced for the album's title track. Over the years, the band played all over Europe, from their native Italy to Russia, as well as performing at festivals like Wave-Gotik-Treffen in Germany. In 2008, XP8 also reached US shores for the first time with their live show, supporting System Syn on a one-month promotional tour. The following year they played at the Kinetik Festival in Canada, and begun working on their fourth studio album Drop The Mask, which was released in early 2010 once again by Infacted Recordings, with the digital-only Want It coming up just a few months before.Straying away from a pure dancefloor sound, the band experimented also with different approaches to electronica, and the album immediately received good praises by the press, consecrating it as the most mature XP8 release to date.Soon afterwards the album was licensed to Metropolis Records for a North American released and peaked at number 1 on the label's mailorder a week before its street date, while a limited digipack edition with a bonus CD was released in Japan by Deathwatch Asia. XP8 is also well known for their remixes, having reworked tracks of several other bands, including Steve Aoki, Attrition, Mortiis, and Icon of Coil, and countless others. In 2013, XP8 released the crowd-funded concept album Adrenochrome, which they described as their best effort to date, without any record label support. Everything came to a grinding halt in 2014 when the band decided to disband, quoting various reasons for this decision, among them the dwindling interest in alternative/industrial dance music, a trend that had a long run for almost two decades but that eventually ran dry. In an interview, Visconti also stated that \u201C[...] no one wants to be the old guy in a room full of kids looking at you like a dinosaur: I remember vividly making fun of those old goths that simply didn\u2019t want to get the fuck out of MY clubs a decade ago, and the last thing I wanted to become was one of them.\u201D  - clearly pointing out the necessity to make space for a younger generation to make things vital and vibrant once again. Before disbanding, XP8 released a series of 3 EPs over a period of 9 months, each released tied to one of the phases of the Alchemical process: the three releases went on to be praised as the band's best material by critics and fans alike, proving how the Italian duo left a mark on the industrial scene for years and years to come. Steven Gullotta at Brutal Resonance stated that \"XP8 may be dead, but their music will forever hold a place within my soul\", giving the band a good send off."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"(For other uses, see Younger Brother (disambiguation).) Younger Brother is an electronic duo formed in 2003 by Simon Posford and Benji Vaughan. Their debut album A Flock of Bleeps was released in 2003, followed by The Last Days of Gravity in 2007 and Vaccine in 2011. After making a remix for a charity record, Simon Posford (Shpongle, Hallucinogen) and Benji Vaughan (Prometheus) decided to come together in the studio to create their own type of electronic music that has been described as \"unclassifiable.\" The album A Flock of Bleeps released on Twisted Records became a cult classic in the underground electronica scene and included such tracks as \u2018Crumblenaut\u2019 and \u2018Finger\u2019. This led to massive demand to see them live and they have played shows from London to Tokyo, New York to Moscow. Inspired by the live shows Simon and Benji decided to move away from the pure electronic sound of the first album A Flock of Bleeps and create a more organic sound. Having no band, they played the instruments themselves and recruited long-time friend and former Leftfield vocalist Ruu Campbell to perform the vocals. The resulting album was Last Days of Gravity (with artwork made by the legendary Storm Thorgerson whose work has graced albums by Pink Floyd, Alan Parsons, and Led Zeppelin, among many others) release in 2007 narrowly missed a nomination for the 2008 Mercury Music Prize and received masses of positive press. They also returned to play shows with the \"Younger Brother Live\" band in Boulder and Denver, Colorado and in California, which included Marc Brownstein (The Disco Biscuits, Electron) on bass, Tom Hamilton (Brothers Past, The American Babies, Electron) on guitar, and Joe Russo (The Benevento/Russo Duo, Furthur, Bustle In Your Hedgerow, The American Babies, Electron) on drums in Japan, the US and played a sell out show to 3,000 people at the Brixton Academy, London. 2009 saw Younger Brother produce \"Phoenix in Dynamite Sky\" for British cult film Heartless, directed by Philip Ridley and due for release in 2010. A successful US tour took place in July, which included a headline set at the Camp Bisco Festival and saw them play to 8,000 people. Their third album Vaccine, recorded with its U.S. band lineup (Marc Brownstein - the Disco Biscuits, Joe Russo (musician) - Benevento/Russo Duo/Furthur (band) & Tom Hamilton - Brothers Past), became available via iTunes on 4 April 2011 and is available streaming from My Old Kentucky Blog. In 2014 the band developed an app for mobile devices and released an alternate album of remixes titled Vaccine Electronic as a free stream for users who installed it. On 16 August 2014 Benji Vaughn stated on Younger Brothers' Facebook page that he would \"be going quiet for a while\" and that \"it's time to disappear for a few years\". The band's name is taken from a Kogi prophecy; the Kogi regarded themselves as the Older Brother and say that the destruction of the Earth and environment would be by Westerners called Younger Brother. Simon Posford and Benji Vaughan describe this in the Twisted DVD from 2007 during an interview. Fragments from this prophecy are found in the song \"Evil and Harm\"."@en ;

Despite initial success, Mission of Burma disbanded in 1983 due to Miller's development of tinnitus caused by the volume of the band's live performances. In its original lineup, the band released only two singles, an EP, and one LP, Vs.

Despite their name, Eagles of Death Metal are not a death metal band and the name is intended to be humorous. In a 2003 interview Homme described the sound of the band as a combination of \"bluegrass slide guitar mixed with stripper drum beats and Canned Heat vocals.\" Hughes is known for his enthusiastic interaction with audiences at live performances. While the band were on stage at Le Bataclan in Paris, France, on November 13, 2015, the audience was attacked by terrorists wielding automatic rifles, grenades and suicide vests.

	dbo:abstract	"On Broken Wings is an American metalcore band from Hull, Massachusetts that formed in 2001. Often credited with pioneering the sound, and coining the term, of \"moshcore\", a term originally used by the band to describe their fusion of metal with elements of post-hardcore and hardcore breakdowns. They are arguably the first deathcore band. After the self-released Number One Beautiful EP, they caught the attention of Eulogy Recordings, where they would then release 2 full-length albums over the next 5 years, 2003's 'Some of us may Never see the World' and 2005's 'It's all a Long Goodbye'. During this time, On Broken Wings was also subject to a variety of controversies, mostly concerning their unusually violent live shows and the band's apparent encouragement of crowd violence. As a result, the band is still banned from many clubs and venues across the United States. In early 2007, On Broken Wings released an EP entitled Going Down which contained the original Number One Beautiful EP as well as 4 new songs. In an ironic twist, the title of the EP was soon considered foreshadowing as the band announced an indefinite hiatus mainly due to interest in other projects. Many considered OBW to have split up for good until a new year rolled around... After a long hiatus, 2008 finally sees the band reuniting and doing some serious touring with the 'Mosh Lives' tour featuring headliners, Emmure and other metalcore acts such as Recon, Ligeia and on select dates, Red I Flight and Endwell."@en ;

Their lyrics (mostly written by Bengtsson, Rasmusson, Berger and Nyl\u00E9n) cover a wide range, frommarxist analysis and invitations to revolution to satire, art criticism, 1940s childhood nostalgia, images from daily life and experimental pop art works. A recurring theme, at least in their early works, is criticism of Saltsj\u00F6badsandan; the Swedish model of mixing capitalism with socialism through cooperation rather than conflict between government, large corporations and unions. One song on this theme, \"Den ena handen vet vad den andra g\u00F6r\", was covered by punk band Ebba Gr\u00F6n (renamed \"Staten och kapitalet\", with some of the lyrics omitted) and became a hit in 1980.

In 2000 the group picked up touring multi-instrumentalists Joshua Grange and David Wolfenberger as well as long-time Creekdipper \"Razz\" Russell, dropped \"Original Harmony Ridge\" from the name and began a two-continent touring schedule in support of three full band recordings: My Own Jo Ellen, December's Child and Mystic Theatre, which featured the touring quintet along with Greg Leisz, Danny Frankel, Don Heffington, Jon Birdsong. December's Child included a duet by Olson and former Jayhawks bandmate Gary Louris. Olson and the Creekdippers have toured in several different combinations without Williams, Grange and Wolfenberger but with drummer Ray Woods and Russell. In 2004 Olson and Louris reunited for a tour with Woods and Russell."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"InI was a hip hop group composed of Rob-O, Grap Luva, Ras G a.k.a. I Love H.I.M.,Marco Polo, now known as Jolomite, and DJ Boodakhan. The group started working on their debut album together with producer Pete Rock in the mid-90s, and signed a deal with Rock's new found imprint Soul Brother Records through Elektra. The record company eventually shelved the album, releasing only one 12\" single in 1996. The track \"Fakin' Jax\", produced and featuring Pete Rock, became an underground hit. The album eventually became one of the most bootlegged album in hip-hop's history, but in 2003 it saw an official release it was included on Lost & Found: Hip Hop Underground Soul Classics, a double LP of Pete Rock's mid-1990s production work, originally canceled by Elektra Records. InI had actually called their debut album \"InI - \"The Life I Live\", although the bootlegged name is contrary stating \"Centre Of Attention\", which is incorrect. Although most people may think Grap Luva is the master of InI, it was actually Rob-O as he was the \"brainchild\" of the work. Rob was highly skilled, as a lyricist & vocalist. Despite the fact that Pete Rock is not an official member of the group, it is synonymous with his name, as he produced almost every track of Center of Attention, and Grap Luva is his younger brother. Rock also had verses on two songs (Fakin Jax & Worldwide) in the albums with additional ad-libs and background vocals on basically every track. InI had released a demo-tape called \"Krossroads\", and \"Concerned\", grap describes this as their earlist tapes. Concerned appears to be called \"For Your Own Concern\" although it was actually called \"Concerned\" by the InI group. Grap's man from France was responsible for sharing concerned. \"The beat is sick\" - Grap, in the song they talk about safe sex; thus the title, to be concerned. The rhyme that rob-o had spit on \"To each his own\" was the rhyme he had spit on \"Concerned\".After Center of Attention got shelved the group members went their separate ways, while only two of them stayed on the music scene to pursue solo careers. Grap Luva released a few limited 12\" singles in the new millennium and aspired to being his real interest in being a beat boy and producing. He appeared, and produced on various albums and singles from artists such as DJ Spinna, J-Live, Pete Rock, Lone Catalysts, Kev Brown and Marley Marl. Rob-O released many singles through an imprint called St. Nick Entertainment and in 2006 he came out with a debut album called \"Rhyme Pro\", a mix of the older 12\" singles with a few new songs sprinkled throughout."@en ;

The liner notes of the band's debut album, Major Organ and the Adding Machine, leave it a mystery as to who is officially featured. When performing live on the Holiday Surprise Tour, the members of the band wore paper masks to maintain their anonymity. It is believed that the main contributors are Jeff Mangum, Julian Koster, Robert Schneider, and Kevin Barnes, whose vocals are most obviously present on the album, but a number of other Elephant 6 musicians are believed to have contributed too, including members of The Olivia Tremor Control, Elf Power, and Of Montreal. In 1997, when thought to be a side-project of Jeff Mangum and Julian Koster, Major Organ and the Adding Machine contributed a cover of Louis Armstrong's What a Wonderful World to a Kindercore Records Christmas compilation. Over the next few years, they recorded a self-titled album and released it on Orange Twin Records in 2001. A trailer for a Major Organ and the Adding Machine film was shown at the 40 Watt Club on May 5, 2007 and August 11, 2007. The film was premiered on October 7, 2008 and shown at every show on the Holiday Surprise Tour in the following weeks. The film contains no dialogue and is accompanied by alternate arrangements of songs from the Major Organ and the Adding Machine album. An expanded version of the album, including a DVD of the film, was released on September 14, 2010, although some consumers received their copies before the announced release date. The films credits, as well as the commentary, seemingly confirm the suspected roster of Elephant Six musicians."@en ;

Moistboyz music is typically fast-paced punk/metal, combining stream-of-consciousness lyrics with aggressive rock guitar riffs. The band's current touring lineup includes Stephen Haas (guitar), as well as Mondo Generator rhythm section Nick Oliveri (bass) and Hoss Wright (drums). As in Melchiondo's band Ween, both he and Heller assume aliases: Mickey Moist and Dickie Moist. Moistboyz have released five studio records starting with the 1994 EP Moistboyz. A full-length album, Moistboyz II, followed in 1996. Recorded by Heller (vocals/lyrics) and Melchiondo (guitar/music) using drum machine and a lo-fi sensibility, both records were originally released on the Beastie Boys label, Grand Royal. In 2005, these first two records were combined and released as one album, Moistboyz I+II] on Sanctuary Records, now on Chocodog Records. In 2002, Moistboyz III was released on Mike Patton's label, Ipecac Records. This is the first Moistboyz record to feature songs with real drums, performed by Lou Croschetti. Moistboyz IV was released in 2005 on Sanctuary Records. The album was mixed by Chris Shaw, features Claude Coleman, Jr. on drums, and bass by producer Andrew Weiss on Fuck You. In 2013, Moistboyz V was released on Heller and Melchiondo's label, Neverman Records, distributed by MVD Audio. Recording started in late 2012 in New Hope, PA and finished in Lago Vista, TX in early 2013. It was produced and engineered by Melchiondo, and mixed by Stephen Haas. Moistboyz V covers multiple musical styles, such as the southern rock-influenced Down on the Farm and the alt ballad \"My Time to Die\". Guest musicians include Chuck Treece (drums) on \"Protect and Serve\", \"Medusa\", \"Garbageman\" and Joe Kramer (guitar) on \"Protect and Serve\", \"Chickendick\", \"Down on the Farm\" and \"My Time to Die\"."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Chick Corea Elektric Band is a jazz fusion band, led by pianist Chick Corea. Following the demise of Return to Forever, Corea established the musical ensemble in 1986. Following a long hiatus, the band reunited to produce To the Stars in 2004. The band's debut album can be described as \"jazz-rock\", though it is much closer to traditional jazz than the jazz-rock albums of the 1970s. The keyboard sounds on the album are typical for the mid-1980s. The drums played by Dave Weckl dominate the album's sound, with the guitar duties split between Scott Henderson and Carlos Rios. The second album, Light Years (1987) is more funk-oriented than its predecessor. Saxophonist Eric Marienthal joins the band and Frank Gambale replaces Henderson and Rios (who still plays on some tracks) to form what is considered the band's definitive lineup. The third album, Eye of the Beholder, relies on softer sounds. Here Corea relies on acoustic piano, with synthesizers largely in the background. Gambale also plays acoustic guitar on some tracks, lending a Flamenco-influenced sound to pieces like \"Eternal Child.\" The Elektric Band's fourth album, Inside Out (1990), features some compositions that fall in the post-bop rather than the fusion category. The four-part piece \"Tale of Daring\", which closes the album, relies on unconventional melodies and relatively free improvisation. But two other compositions, the title track and \"Kicker,\" are more traditional fusion pieces. Corea still uses mostly acoustic piano, but Gambale plays electric guitar throughout. The last album featuring the band's traditional lineup was Beneath the Mask (1991), a return to the electric jazz-funk of the second album. For the next album, Elektric Band II: Paint the World (1993), only Corea and Marienthal returned from the original lineup. Gary Novak became the new drummer, Jimmy Earl took the bass, and Mike Miller played guitar. The album's style can be described as modern jazz, crossing between post-bop and fusion. In 1996, the band teamed up with Steve Vai's Monsters to record a version of \"Rumble\" from West Side Story for the RCA Victor tribute album called The Songs of West Side Story. The original members reunited in 2004 for To the Stars (2004), which is stylistically close to the avant-garde and post-bop on Inside Out. After the final studio album the band has toured also with Victor Wooten who has replaced Patitucci, who returned to the band in the middle of 2016."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"The Filthy Thieving Bastards is an American folk/punk rock group formed in 2000 in San Francisco, California. The band was originally a side project put together by Johnny Bonnel and Darius Koski of the Swingin' Utters. Spike Slawson (also from Swingin' Utters) later joined the band, along with recording engineer Randy Burk. Greg Lisher from Camper Van Beethoven guested on guitar for several songs on their second release. Their music is influenced by folk rock, Celtic rock, country music, 60's pop, and punk rock, with an acknowledged and oft-noted debt to the music of The Pogues. The project's first (short) album, Our Fathers Sent Us, was released by TKO Records in 2000. In 2001, the band released A Melody of Retreads and Broken Quills on BYO Records. The next album My Pappy Was a Pistol was released in 2005. In March 2007 Filthy Thieving Bastards released their next album ... and I'm A Son of a Gun on BYO Records, featuring an appearance by Spider Stacey of the Pogues. The naming of the last two albums was a nod to American Singer/Songwriter Roger Miller. The song \"Drug Lords of the Avenues\" is featured on the in-game soundtrack for Skate."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Harsh Reality are a little-known, proto-prog band formed in Stevenage, Hertfordshire in 1968 out of the remnants of the Freightliner Blues Band (formerly the Revolution). The band consisted of Mark Griffiths and Dave Jenkins on guitars, Alan Greed on lead vocals and organ, Roger Swallow on drums, and Steve Miller on bass and backing vocals. They released a single for Philips Records in 1968 (\"Tobacco Ash Sunday\" / \"How Do You Feel\") before releasing their only album, Heaven and Hell, also on Philips in 1969. A final single followed soon after, before the band split in 1969. Their Heaven and Hell LP is now a highly-sought rarity, selling for hundreds of pounds between eager collectors. For this reason, Harsh Reality is somewhat famous/infamous in collecting circles. Though seen as part of the proto-progressive rock era, their work represented a marriage between the sounds of Procol Harum, Traffic and early Deep Purple. Following the band's demise, Roger Swallow played with Principal Edwards Magic Theatre, Matthews Southern Comfort, Plainsong, Albion Country Band, and Al Stewart; before moving to California and establishing himself as an electronic musician, songwriter and entrepreneur. Alan Greed went on to work with Ray Russell on the Rock Workshop albums, and as a session singer. Greed later fronted the jazz/progressive outfit, The Running Man. A self-titled album was released in the UK on the Neon record label in 1972. Mark Griffiths has worked with Matthews Southern Comfort, Jonathan Kelly, Al Stewart, David Essex, The Everly Brothers, and Cliff Richard & The Shadows. The rest of the band also went into session work. The song \"Tobacco Ash Sunday\" was covered by Paul Weller for AOL Sessions. Heaven and Hell will be reissued officially for the first time on CD by Esoteric Recordings on 26 September 2011, with four bonus tracks and a 16-page booklet containing a lengthy interview with the band."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Las Chicas Del Can was an all-female merengue group from Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic. Originally created by pianist Belkis Concepci\u00F3n, several teams of female vocalists and musicians have alternately performed under the name Las Chicas del Can throughout the group's history. Originally founded in 1982, Las Chicas del Can performed hit after hit throughout the eighties, and a great number of their singles and albums achieved gold and/or platinum status. Hits such as \"El Negro No Puede,\" \"La Media Mar\u00EDa,\" \"Suka\u00EDna,\" \"Juana la Cubana,\" \"Culeca,\" \"Ta' Pillao,\" \"Fuego,\" \"Fiebre,\" and \"Las Peque\u00F1as Cosas\" are now regarded merengue classics. Pianist Belkis Concepci\u00F3n left the group early to go solo in 1985. Singers Miriam Cruz and Eunice Betances then teamed up and got vocal support from, among others, Luchy Betances and Ver\u00F3nica Medina. Ver\u00F3nica Medina herself then went solo in 1987.In 1988 singer Heidy Bello joined Las Chicas Del Can but was replaced in 1991 by singers Arismar Eduardo and Rosana Eusebio. In 1992, the group reinvented itself under the name M\u00EDriam Cruz y Las Chicas. The first year under that name, they produced a successful album entitled Nueva Vida featuring a hitsong written by Juan Luis Guerra, \"Te Propongo.\" Later that year, \"La Loba\" was also well received by merengue fans and quickly became another hit. A European tour (1993-1994) soon followed. In 1994 Miriam Cruz y Las Chicas scored another hit with the song \"Con Agua de Sal (OTI),\" and 1995 included another successful European tour. Meanwhile, the original name was kept alive by a music industry manager who discovered a group of new and talented young ladies who would carry the torch for Las Chicas del Can and leave their own mark on merengue music. In 1993, Michell Flores, Grissel Baez and Flor\u00E1ngel del Villar teamed up to keep the legacy alive. Due to the situation not entirely clear among fans, the new girls were hailed as the \"Monumental\". They started traveling around the globe, covering the band's original repertoire with songs like \"Juana la Cubana\". This 2nd line-up of Las Chicas Del Can quickly became a successful act in their own right with hit tunes such as \"Voy Pa'll\u00E1,\" \"Hacer El Amor Con Otro,\" \"Celoso,\" \"Explosivo\" and \"Sin Compromiso.\" After the albums \"Botando Chispas\" (1994) and \"Derramando Sue\u00F1os\" (1996) lead singer Michell Flores went solo and the 2nd line-up of Las Chicas del Can disbanded in 1998. Las Chicas del Can was eventually reformed a third time in 1999, but this particular group was never able to achieve the success of earlier line-ups. To this date, the first line-up of Las Chicas Del Can (which featured M\u00EDriam Cruz, Eunice Betances and Theresa Dom\u00EDnguez) has proven to be the most successful line-up."@en ;

It featured a diverse selection of songs ranging from pure pop to straight-up hip-hop. The following year they released a follow-up in the form of a mixtape CD called Cut Some Static. Cut Some Static was an album-length compilation of previously unreleased tracks, but was not released as a proper album. It was not sold at retail, came packaged with home-computer printed labels, and featured members of the band introducing tracks, to keep the underground mixtape feel. Musically, it also featured a grittier, more rap-oriented sound, and more explicit lyrics. Marty James was featured on the hook of The Federation's 2006 west coast club anthem \"I Wear My Stunna Glasses at Night\". Since that time he has also become an accomplished writer and producer having worked with JR Rotem, E-40, Far East Movement Sean Kingston, Baby Bash, Paula DeAnda, Diane Warren, Rick Rock, Lil Jon, The Grouch, DJ Felli Fel, Jessi Malay, MoZella, Laze & Royal, The Stooie Brothers and more.

	dbo:abstract	"C-Tec was a band originally formed as a side project in 1995 by Jean-Luc De Meyer (of Front 242), Jonathan Sharp (of New Mind), and Ged Denton (of Crisis NTI) as The Cyber-Tec Project. The name was taken from Cyber-Tec Records, who released their first album. This EP was also released on Fifth Column Records in the US. After this release, Jonathan Sharp left the band (due to problems with Cyber-Tec Records manager Paul M. Green), and Marc Heal (of Cubanate) joined as a full-time member. The band had been conceived as a one-off project, but the members at this point decided to pursue further material. In 1997, after shortening their name to C-Tec, they released a full album, Darker, on the US industrial Wax Trax! label. C-Tec existed during the late 1990s hiatus in the Front 242 line-up, with De Meyer (the original lead singer in 242) apparently leaving that band for a period. The band toured North America twice in 1998 with a hybrid lineup featuring other members of Cubanate and Julian Beeston, one time drummer in Nitzer Ebb. The second album, Cut, was released in 2000 on SPV imprint Synthetic Symphony. The album was originally slated for US release on Wax Trax! but the label closed around this time. Thereby, Cut never had an official American release. In terms of how C-Tec sounded, Darker contains a surprisingly downbeat, moody collection of songs, showing strong electronic influences but with more ambient textures than would be suggested by the industrial music backgrounds of the main participants. Cut is faster in tempo, with De Meyer\u2019s vocal mixed low. Most of the material on the two full-length C-Tec albums was co-written by Marc Heal and Jean-Luc De Meyer. Since Cut, C-Tec appears to have been inactive, though lead singer Jean-Luc De Meyer later resurfaced with a new Front 242 album in 2003."@en ;

The band consisted of two members: Pink (John Dwyer) and Brown (Jeff Rosenberg). Pink played guitar and sang while Brown played drums. The band was influenced by the sounds and styles of bands such as Olneyville Sound System and Lightning Bolt. The band's live shows (the first ever of which was at O'Brien's in Allston, MA) featured a chaotic and frenetic performance from both members. The San Francisco Bay Guardian described their live sound as \u201CKorean folk drumming gone punk.\u201D Both members would appear onstage in outlandish outfits that corresponded with their colorful pseudonyms. The band broke up in 2003. On their message board they announced their disbanding simply: Mommy and daddy still love you but they just can't stay married. We hope this doesn't put a damper on your childhood but we think you'll be just fine. Dwyer went on to play with Coachwhips, Yikes! and The Hospitals. He is currently playing with Thee Oh Sees.

	dbo:abstract	"Dead Mens' Theory was a band consisting of the lead guitarist (Andrew Logan, also drummer of Hondo) and bass guitarist (Tom Rankine) of Bird of Ill Omen and the singer of the experimental noisecore band Hondo. Dead Mens' Theory considered itself a Bird of Ill Omen side-project. However, their intent was to play music more raw and aggressive than Bird of Ill Omen, and to capture the chaotic-noise aspect of Hondo. The band's ethical purpose was \"to warn people about the scariest thing, love\". The band was short-lived but managed to sell out all of the printed 7\"s of their first recording To Never Love Again. The band never had an official bass guitar player, but initially Peter Bartsocas did play the bass guitar at shows. At the time of the band, Bartsocas had already left As Friends Rust and Rankine was to join a few years later."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Enthroned is a black metal band formed in Charleroi in 1993 by Cernunnos. He soon recruited guitarist Tsebaoth and a vocalist from grindcore/black metal band Hecate who stayed until the end of December 1993. Then bassist/vocalist Sabathan joined. The band released a five-track demo tape in mid-1994 which brought them to the attention of several independent labels. A 7-inch split EP with Ancient Rites was then released by the underground label Afterdark Records. After the label's demise, Evil Alliance Records (a sub-label of Osmose Productions) released Enthroned's first full-length release, Prophecies of Pagan Fire. Shortly thereafter, the band enlisted second guitarist Nornagest. Eventually, Tseboath was replaced by Nebiros. In 1996, along with Ancient Rites and Bewitched, Enthroned began an extensive tour of Europe. In April 1997, as Enthroned was to begin recording Towards the Skullthrone of Satan, Cernunnos hanged himself. Enthroned recorded the album with a session drummer in honor of Cernunnos and performed at the Dragons Blaze festival with newly acquired drummer Namroth Blackthorn. In April 1998, the band toured the European continent with Dark Funeral and also released the mini CD Regie Axese, which was dedicated to their former drummer Cernunnos. Later that year, they toured again with labelmates Hecate Enthroned and Usurper. At the close of 1998, the band entered Abyss Studios (Sweden) to record The Apocalypse Manifesto. The band's third album was released in May 1999 and dealt with the biblical concept of the Apocalypse as interpreted by a Norse mythological perspective. Enthroned rounded off the 20th Century on tour with Marduk and continued to tour in Europe. In 2000, the band parted ways with Nebiros and recruited Nerath Daemon as their new guitarist, went on a German mini tour followed by several other European shows and recorded Armoured Bestial Hell at Real Sound Studio (Germany). This fourth album was released in April 2001. Namroth Blackthorn was replaced by Alsvid from the French black metal band Seth. Enthroned continued to play many live gigs in and around Europe, as well as in the US. In early 2002, Enthroned signed to Napalm Records releasing their fifth full-length recording, Carnage in Worlds Beyond, later that year. In June 2003, Nguaroth (guitars) and Glaurung (drums) joined Enthroned, which played a South American tour and released their sixth album, XES Haereticum. In 2005, Enthroned released their first official live album, Black Goat Ritual, recorded during their tour of Brazil. Enthroned parted ways with longtime vocalist Sabathan, at which time Nornagest took over the vocals and Phorgath joined the band on bass. In June 2007, Enthroned recorded their seventh album Tetra Karcist, seeing the return of old drummer Alsvid for the studio sessions. Ahephahim joined as the new official drummer in June 2007 and Enthroned signed with Regain Records in January 2008. At this time, some members of the band opened a recording studio, Blackout Multimedia. In the meantime, Ahephaim and Nguaroth left the band due to lack of time and were replaced by ex-Gorgoroth drummer Garghuf. Nerath Daemon took back the position he left five years ago in Enthroned, changing his name to Neraath. Enthroned's eight album, Pentagrammaton, was released on 22 March 2010. Since then, Nornagest has given up playing guitar in live performances, due to chronic tendonitis in his wrist, and has instead become the band's frontman. Former members Lord Sabathan and Nguaroth joined the band for a one-off live performance in 2010 as an act of reconciliation. In September 2011, Enthroned announce that their collaboration with Regain Records has ended while the band was busy recording their ninth studio album."@en ;

The band's music is often described as \"indie rock\", but Pizzorno has said he \"hates indie bands\" and does not feel Kasabian fit into that category. Kasabian have released five studio albums \u2013 Kasabian (2004), Empire (2006), West Ryder Pauper Lunatic Asylum (2009), Velociraptor! (2011), and 48:13 (2014). They are due to release their sixth album in 2017. The band's music has been described as a mix between The Stone Roses and Primal Scream with the swagger of Oasis.

GBH were early pioneers of English street punk, often nicknamed \"UK82\", along with Discharge, Broken Bones, The Exploited and The Varukers. GBH have gone on to influence several punk rock musicians. The name GBH was inspired by then-bassist Sean McCarthy's trial for grievous bodily harm.

The group was formed as a result of a 1999 talent contest called \"Avex Dream 2000\". Originally a three-piece group consisting of Mai Matsumuro, Kana Tachibana, and Yu Hasebe, the group has undergone many changes since its debut in 2000 on the Avex Trax label, and none of the original trio remain. The original trio sold over 950,700 records, and in total the group has sold over 1,100,000 records over the span of 10 years. On July 7, 2002, the main lyricist Mai Matsumuro left the group to pursue a solo career. After Matsumuro's departure, Avex held another audition to replace Matsumuro. Instead of one, six new members won the audition, resulting in an eight-member (Dream) group with the debut single \"Music is My Thing\". On March 2004, Risa Ai left to pursue a solo career. They became a 7-member group as performed this way until 2007. During this time, the band's name changed from dream to DRM. In August 2008, Yu Hasebe left the group to pursue a solo career, leaving Kana Tachibana behind as the only original member of dream. Afterward, DRM became Dream again. In August 2010, Dream released their official major re-debut single, \"My Way: Ulala\" on the Rhythm Zone label. On November 24, 2010, Dream released their first album as a six-member group, titled Hands Up! on the Rhythm Zone label. On November 23, 2010, Tachibana announced that she would leave the group. This marked the departure of the last member of the original three-member group. She officially left the group on February 20, 2011. On March 30, 2012, Sayaka Yamamoto departed to pursue a solo career."@en ;

Guitarist and arranger Jimmy Vivino is the group's leader. The group was originally formed and led by drummer Max Weinberg in 1993, and played under the name The Max Weinberg 7 when it was the house band for Late Night with Conan O'Brien in New York through 2009. The band then played under Max Weinberg and The Tonight Show Band during their brief 2009\u20132010 stint on The Tonight Show with Conan O'Brien in Los Angeles. They were then briefly known as the The Legally Prohibited Band during their participation with O'Brien in the 2010 The Legally Prohibited from Being Funny on Television Tour. During The Max Weinberg 7 days, the band included Jimmy Vivino on guitar, Richie \"LaBamba\" Rosenberg on trombone, Scott Healy on keyboard, Mike Merritt on bass guitar, Mark \"Love Man\" Pender on trumpet and acoustic guitar, and Jimmy's older brother Jerry Vivino on woodwinds. When the group moved to Los Angeles to become The Tonight Show Band, they added an eighth member, James Wormworth, on percussion. Wormworth had often substituted as drummer when Weinberg toured with Bruce Springsteen as a member of the E Street Band, prior to being made a permanent fixture in the band; Jimmy Vivino had served as the band's leader during those periods. Weinberg did not participate in the Legally Prohibited Tour and his departure from the group and from O'Brien was made official in September 2010."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"M\u00FCnchener Freiheit (known sometimes simply as Freiheit) is a German pop and rock band that had released seventeen albums by 2007, six of which have gone gold and have sold over five million copies in Europe. They are named after a square in the city of Munich in Germany, meaning \"Munich liberty\". It is considered part of the Neue Deutsche Welle musical movement. They are best known in the English-speaking world for their single \"Keeping the Dream Alive\". This song became a #14 hit single in the UK Singles Chart when released in December 1988, making M\u00FCnchener Freiheit a one-hit wonder there. Due to its December release and rich orchestral sound, \"Keeping the Dream Alive\" still receives a lot of airplay at Christmas time and can be found included on many Christmas compilation albums. In the United States the song failed to chart there when it was originally released, gaining favour with the American public only after it was featured in the soundtrack for the movie Say Anything.... The single has received additional exposure in the United States thanks to the singing talent contest American Idol on the Fox television network. The song has been used in recent seasons as a backdrop to video montages featuring contestants on the programme."@en ;

The band's music is characterized by studio experimentation, vocal harmonies, and an exploration of various genres which include freak folk, noise rock, ambient drone, and psychedelia. Records released under the name \"Animal Collective\" may include contributions from any or all of its members. In the example of Dibb, who often takes breaks from recording and performing with the band, his time off does not constitute full leave. The band members met in school and started recording together in various forms of collaboration from a young age. Originally a duo comprising Lennox and Portner, the collective was not officially established until all four members came together for the album Here Comes the Indian (2003). Previous collaborations between two or more members were then retroactively classified under Animal Collective's discography. In 1999, they established the record label Paw Tracks, issuing what is now considered their debut album, Spirit They're Gone, Spirit They've Vanished (2000), as well as work by other artists. In 2009, the band released their most commercially successful album, Merriweather Post Pavilion, which Uncut magazine called: \"one of the landmark American albums of the century so far\"."@en ;

The records consisted of collections of breaks, loops and samples, that could be used for mixing, remixing and producing. The later DJ Food albums have developed with shades of Latin, dub, techno, ambient, and Jungle. The 1995 album, A Recipe for Disaster was a conscious move away from the Jazz Brakes volumes to form more of an identity as an artist, and a remix album of tracks from all 6 LPs, entitled Refried Food was released the following year. The more recent release, Kaleidoscope, features guest artists including Bundy K. Brown (formerly of Tortoise, Directions in Music, Pullman) and voiceover artist and jazz poet, Ken Nordine."@en ;

This was followed in 1989 with Wakin' Up the Dead. 1991 saw the release of This Is The Healing, utilising a drum machine and Knott playing most of the musical instruments. The Grape Prophet (1993) was the first of rock operas by Knott. Released in 1993, the fifth album was Cash In Chaos: World Tour. At this point Knott announced that he was changing the name of LSU to 'Cash in Chaos' (henced the mixed band name for this release). 1994's Grace Shaker was followed in 1998 by Dogfish Jones, another rock opera.

	dbo:abstract	"No Motiv is a punk rock band from Oxnard, California. The current line up includes Jeremy Palaszewski on lead vocals/guitar, Max McDonald on guitar/vocals, Jeff Hershey on bass/vocals, and former bassist Roger Camero on drums. Camero never left the band, but rather moved to the drums when drummer Pat Pedraza left the band to join alternative rock band From Satellite. Their first album, Cynical, was distributed by Edge Records. Their second album, Scarred, is a collection of unreleased demos and remixes also released by Edge Records. No Motiv subsequently left Edge for unspecified reasons. The band is known for rarely, if ever, playing songs from these two albums at their live shows. The band signed to Vagrant Records and had its greatest success with the 2004 release Daylight Breaking, which reached No. 36 on Billboard's Top Independent albums chart. During the past few years, No Motiv has played only a handful of live shows. While the band has never released an official statement announcing their breakup, they're considered to be on hiatus and inactive at the present time. Jeremy and Jeff reside in Ventura, CA, and started recording material under a new band called Monster Hand. The band never really got off the ground, resulting in Palaszewski starting a solo project entitled \"Sea Greens\" and Hershey assembling his soul powerhouse \"Jeff Hershey and The Heartbeats\". Max lives in Brooklyn, NY and has been recording material under the solo moniker Gentlemen. Roger resides in Irvine, CA, plays bass for Peace'd Out, and writes songs for fun under the name He Fails Me. All band members remain close friends to this day, and also are involved in many side projects in addition to the ones mentioned above, such as Hybrid Moments, Death Country Blues, and Machines."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Xutos & Pontap\u00E9s are a Portuguese rock band, which got together in 1978, in Almada, Portugal, four years after the Carnation Revolution restored most freedoms to the country. They started off in the local punk rock scene and set the trend \u2013 singing rock tunes in Portuguese. After three decades of studio and live albums, Xutos & Pontap\u00E9s continue to be considered Portugal's top rock band, still influencing new generations of Portuguese bands. In 2004, then Portuguese President Jorge Sampaio granted the band a state decoration for 25 years of career achievements in the music industry. On 26 September 2009, they played in Lisbon to a packed football stadium, Est\u00E1dio do Restelo, to commemorate their 30th anniversary. They played for three hours \u2013 each hour marking a decade of their steadily successful career. It was the first time seven screens were used on stage in Portugal. Current members are most of the original line up Tim (bass/ vocals), Z\u00E9 Pedro (guitar), Jo\u00E3o Cabeleira (guitar \u2013 since 1983), Kal\u00FA (drums/ backing vocals) and Gui (sax/ backing vocals). Fans refer to the band as Xutos; and Xutos is pronounced 'shootoosh'. Both 'xutos' and 'pontap\u00E9s' are words in reference to types of kicks, but with a twist because the first word when spelled \"Chutos\" is referred for kick on a ball or object, but here used as \"'xutos\", slang for Heroin injection, while 'pontap\u00E9s' for kicks mainly on persons."@en ;

Later members include Jason Bill and Heather Leigh Murray, but the band has long considered itself primarily a duo between Tom and Christina Carter. The name of the band derives from the surname of a customer at the record shop where Tom and Christina met. Their music contains elements typical of psychedelic music such as reverb, backwards recording, extended instrumental jamming and the use of found sounds. In addition to several major releases on labels such as Kranky, Eclipse Records, and Time-Lag Records, they have also released many small edition CD-Rs on their own Wholly Other label, and other small independent labels, some of which have later been re-issued (Our Bed is Green, and Historic Sixth Ward for example). Core members Tom Carter and Christina Carter are divorced but remain together as a musical unit. They have also released albums on Kranky and Eclipse Records under their own names, as well as several small edition CD-Rs. In addition the two have collaborated with numerous other musicians such as Loren Mazzacane Connors, Yellow Swans and Robert Horton."@en ;

They were formed in 1997 by the same team that managed the Spice Girls before they launched their career. The group were mostly known as a five-piece, consisting of Robinson, Neville, Conlon, Abz Love and Jason \"J\" Brown. Five enjoyed remarkable success worldwide, particularly in the United Kingdom, most of Europe, and Asia. The group have currently based on BPI certifications sold a minimum of 1.6 million albums and 2 million singles in the UK alone. They split up on 27 September 2001 after selling 20 million records worldwide. Robinson, Love, Neville, and Brown briefly reformed the group without Conlon (who departed before their 2001 split) in September 2006, with a new management team headed by music manager Richard Beck. Eight months later, having secured a lucrative tour but failing to gain enough record company interest, Five made an announcement via their official website that they would again disband. In 2012, the group announced that they were planning another reunion, this time with Conlon on board. Lead singer Brown initially agreed to take part in the reunion, but later changed his mind, claiming that he no longer wanted to be in the public eye. The group continued with only four members, but decided to keep the name Five. Alongside Blue, 911, Atomic Kitten, B*Witched, Honeyz and Liberty X, Five were featured in the ITV2 documentary series The Big Reunion, which began airing on 31 January 2013. This was followed by a comeback performance at the Hammersmith Apollo on 26 February 2013 and an arena tour around the UK and Ireland in May, which was their first ever tour without Brown. In November and December 2013, Five headlined their own tour, the 5ive Greatest Hits Tour, their first solo tour as a four-piece."@en ;

The band members have included vocalist Maria Del Mar, guitarist Mark Crossley, guitarist Tim Welch, bassist Mark Storm, saxophonist Chris Weiss and drummer Garry Flint. The band came together after a chance meeting between Del Mar and Storm in an alley during a party in Toronto, Ontario; that initial meeting was actually an argument about musical taste, because Storm was a fan of gothic rock bands such as Bauhaus, while del Mar was into Spanish classical music, Motown, swing music and punk rock. Six months later, they released a self-titled independent EP, before signing to Intrepid Records in 1987. Their self-titled debut album was released in 1988, and spawned the radio single \"Flesh Under Skin\". In 1989, their single and video for \"68 Hours\" garnered them a CASBY Award. Their follow-up album, Courage was recorded in England with producer Zeus B. Held, and was released in 1990. The album was supported by a cross-Canada tour, and gave the band further radio airplay for the singles \"Shine On\" and \"Sex Gorilla\". (The latter title was a band in-joke. The song had actually been written as \"Sarsparilla\", but the fans kept misunderstanding the lyrics, so the band relented and retitled the song.) \"Sex Gorilla\" also led to a fan tradition of throwing bananas at the stage during their shows. The band subsequently left Capitol Records, and released their third and final album Wildseed in 1995 on the independent label Iron Music. Despite frequent confusion, Del Mar is not the same person as television actress Maria del Mar. She has continued to work in the Toronto music scene, including gigs with Classic Albums Live and with the Rolling Stones tribute band Midnight Ramblers. Storm was reported missing in November 2002. The following June, his body was found in Lake Ontario. The band has performed periodically, including shows at Toronto's Bovine Sex Club in 2011 and 2012, and continue to perform at select venues."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Pigmy Love Circus is a Los Angeles rock band that has existed since the mid 1980s era of the Hollywood underground rock scene. Pigmy Love Circus originally consisted of Shepherd Stevenson on bass, Mike Savage on vocals, Anthony Martinez (of Black Flag) on drums, with Rand \"Pig\" Walters and Peter Fletcher on guitars. Danny Carey joined in 1992, but his tenure was cut short by his joining the progressive metal band Tool. By 1995, Pigmy Love Circus disbanded. What was left of the band went their separate ways. Savage went on to form 57 Crown and Big Ugly, both being formidable bands in Hollywood. Stevenson now composes music for film. Fletcher moved to Denver. Rand \"Pig\" Walters disappeared. In 1999, Fletcher returned to Los Angeles and the flame was rekindled when Carey demanded a reunion. The band toured several times in the U.S. in 2002-2004 both alone and also opening for A Perfect Circle in the U.S. and Canada. In 2012, Pigmy Love Circus played a Dog Patch Wino Reunion show at the Dragonfly in Los Angeles. In 2014 Rand \"Pig\" Walters reappeared and released a solo record which is only currently available on his rawpork2014.com website.It was recorded in Nashville and San Francisco, engineered, mixed and mastered by Mark Fuller. Known for lively, confrontational concerts the band's music and primal energy incite fans to jump on stage (encouraged by the band) and sing along on songs such as \"Dagwood Killed Blondie\" and \"Mad House Clown\". The band achieved iconic status in the Los Angeles underground music scene. The band is currently working on material for their next release."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"The Four Tops are an American vocal quartet from Detroit, Michigan who helped to define the city's Motown sound of the 1960s. The group's repertoire has included soul music, R&B, disco, adult contemporary, doo-wop, jazz, and show tunes. Founded as The Four Aims, lead singer Levi Stubbs, and groupmates Abdul \"Duke\" Fakir, Renaldo \"Obie\" Benson and Lawrence Payton remained together for over four decades, having gone from 1953 until 1997 without a change in personnel. The Four Tops were among a number of groups, including the Miracles, the Marvelettes, Martha and the Vandellas, the Temptations, and the Supremes, who established the Motown Sound around the world during the 1960s. They were notable for having Stubbs, a baritone, as their lead singer, whereas most male/mixed vocal groups of the time were fronted by a tenor. The group was the main male vocal group for the highly successful songwriting and production team of Holland\u2013Dozier\u2013Holland, who crafted a stream of hit singles on Motown. These included two Billboard Hot 100 number-one hits for the Tops: \"I Can't Help Myself (Sugar Pie Honey Bunch)\" in 1965 and \"Reach Out I'll Be There\" in 1966. After Holland-Dozier-Holland left Motown in 1967, the Four Tops were assigned to a number of producers, primarily Frank Wilson, but generally with less success. When Motown left Detroit in 1972 to move to Los Angeles, California, the Tops stayed in Detroit but signed a new recording deal with ABC Records' Dunhill imprint. Recording mainly in Los Angeles, they continued to have chart singles into the late 1970s, including the million-seller, \"Ain't No Woman\", their second release on Dunhill, produced by Steve Barri and composers Dennis Lambert and Brian Potter. In the 1980s, the Four Tops recorded for Casablanca Records, Arista Records and Motown, returning to that label on two occasions for brief stays. Apart from their Indestructible album (owned by Sony Music Entertainment), Universal Music Group controls the rights to their entire post-1963 catalog (through various mergers and acquisitions), as well as their 1956 single, \"Could It Be You\". A change of line-up was finally forced upon the group when Lawrence Payton died on June 20, 1997. The group initially continued as a three-piece under the name The Tops, before Theo Peoples (formerly of The Temptations) was recruited as the new fourth member. Peoples eventually took over the role of lead singer when Stubbs suffered a stroke in 2000, with Ronnie McNeir then joining the group. On July 1, 2005, Benson died of lung cancer with Payton's son Roquel Payton replacing him. Levi Stubbs died on October 17, 2008. Fakir, McNeir, Payton, and Harold \"Spike\" Bonhart, who replaced Peoples in 2011, are still performing together as the Four Tops. The 2016 Four Tops included Fakir as the only surviving founding member of the original group and Payton as a second-generation member."@en ;

Formed in 2004, the group currently consists of vocalist Oliver Sykes, guitarist Lee Malia, bassist Matt Kean, drummer Matt Nicholls and keyboardist Jordan Fish. They are signed to RCA Records globally and Columbia Records exclusively in the United States. The style of their early work, including their debut album Count Your Blessings, has primarily been described as deathcore, but they started to adopt a more eclectic style of metalcore on subsequent albums. Furthermore, their latest album That's the Spirit marked a shift in their sound to less aggressive rock music styles. Bring Me the Horizon released their debut album Count Your Blessings in 2006. Upon release, the album was met with great polarisation amongst the public and critical disdain. The band began to break away from their controversial sound with Suicide Season (2008), which proved to be a creative, critical and commercial turning point for the band. Bring Me the Horizon then released their third album There Is a Hell, Believe Me I've Seen It. There Is a Heaven, Let's Keep It a Secret. In 2010, propelling them to greater international fame, whilst incorporating influences from classical, electronica and pop. Their major label debut, Sempiternal achieved Gold certification in Australia (35,000) and Silver in the United Kingdom (60,000). That's the Spirit debuted at #2 in the UK charts, selling almost 2 times the previous album with 44,300 first week sales.

In 2005 they released a live auto-bootleg \"The Drisneyland Chronicles Vol.I\". In Spring 2007 the core band members composed an ambient soundtrack \"Dante. Moscow\" for a photo installation based on Dante\u2019s \u201CDivine Comedy\u201D (released as a digital file in 2008). In November 2007 the third official album for RAIG entitled \"The Hollow Grail\" came out. It consisted of live material and marked the return to more abrasive noise imrov direction. Next came \"The Flood of Ixtlan\" EP, 30-minute amalgamation of different styles, from IDM to micronoise and freak-folk. A year later, a collection of studio outtakes, live cuts and other rarities, \"Les 120 Minuetes de Sadomasonodoraemonocuporamenosodom\" was also made available for download on RAIG affiliated net-label Accessory Takes. While this record included mostly song-oriented tracks in noise-rock vein, next studio album by Won James Won entitled \"Corpus Unhearmeticum\" operates in collage, musique concr\u00E8te and dark ambient aesthetics. Artwork for the strictly limited edition of this CD courtesy of ZonderZond is especially ambitious. In 2011 the band delved deeper into field recordings/plunderphonics territory with self-released \"Homeostat EP\". Sounds incorporated in this work were sampled in variety of abandoned factories and wild forests in rural Russia. Next EP was called \"\u0413\u0415\u041D\u0428\u0422\u0410\u0411 \u0414\u0415\u0421\u0411\u041E\u0422\" - a grim-sounding foray into dark ambient electronics. The latest full-length studio album by Won James Won, \"\u0412\u043E\u0438\u043D\u044F \u0412\u0435\u0437\u0443\u043C\u0438\u044F\" is decidedly melodical and song-structured but still as off-kilter as anything in the band's discography. Won James Won are members of ZveZdaZ art-movement. The band is considered as one of the most prolific on Russian underground scene. Their albums were distributed by such well-known underground labels as Cold Spring (U.K.), Amanita (France) and Crucial Blast (US)."@en ;

The band makes use of both electronic and traditional instruments, and has sought to use electronics to recreate traditional indie rock song forms and instrumental structures. The group has released two albums on each of the American indie labels Teenbeat Records and Absolutely Kosher, and their track \"All I do\" was prominently featured in the soundtrack for the major film Wicker Park. The group has developed a devoted following in Japan and Taiwan, and has toured there frequently. Although many artists append bonus tracks onto the end of Japanese album releases to discourage purchasers from buying cheaper US import versions, the overseas versions of +/- albums are usually quite different from the US versions - track lists can be rearranged, artwork with noticeable changes is used, and tracks from the US version can be replaced as well as augmented by bonus tracks."@en ;

In late 2011 following a two-year break the duo announced they had changed their name to \"Cherise & Nadia\" and went on a mini-tour in Australia to promote material from their debut album. In October 2011 the duo released their first promotional single \"This Night\".

	dbo:abstract	"Cellador is a power metal band based in Denver, Colorado. Originally from Omaha, Nebraska, the band was founded in 2003 by Chris Petersen, the band's primary songwriter, as a direct contrast to the overcrowded metalcore and death metal scenes of the American Midwest. The band has had multiple lineup changes since its inception, but is now rounded out by bass player James Pickett, drummer Nick McCallister, keyboardist Diego Valadez, and guitarist Eric Meyers. In 2005 the band signed to Metal Blade Records after playing a show with The Black Dahlia Murder. Cellador's debut album Enter Deception was released in 2006. The band recorded the album at Erik Rutan's Mana Studios. In an article from the December 2006 issue of Metal Maniacs magazine, Chris Petersen says he created the band name in reference to a J.R.R. Tolkien essay which stated that the two words have an appealing sound when combined. Petersen also said that the band was originally called \"Apostate\", but the name was later changed to Cellador because he felt it was more fitting for the band. Cellador has toured across the United States, Canada and Mexico with bands such as Trivium, Bullet for My Valentine, All that Remains, Protest the Hero, The Human Abstract, The Sword, Behemoth, and Sonata Arctica.  They have also performed at the ProgPower USA festival in Atlanta, Georgia, as well as the LoudPark festival in Japan, among many others. The band went into hiatus in the year 2009 after several members of the \"Enter Deception\" era lineup left the band. In 2011 after 2 years without any updates, the band quietly released 4 demo songs online from their upcoming EP entitled \"Honor Forth.\" Led by guitarist/songwriter Chris Petersen, the band held continuous auditions for the entirety of 2009-2012 and ultimately reformed with bass player James Pickett, drummer Nick Mccallister, keyboardist Diego Valadez, and guitarist Caleb Delaet. Petersen officially took up the lead vocalist position in 2012. In December 2012, the band announced new live shows beginning in 2013. They spent the entirety of the year establishing in the Colorado area, and playing one-off shows as guest openers for Havok, Into Eternity, Helloween, Shining, Vale of Pnath, Amaranthe, and others. In February 2014 the band announced signing with Extreme Management Group, and announced a Spring US tour with thrash bands Hatchet and Diamond Plate. Exmortus filled for several shows on the tour after Diamond Plate pulled out due to travel issues. The band indicated they would release long awaited new material in 2014."@en ;

Weilerstein formed the group that summer at the Marlboro Music School and Festival with violinist Peter Salaff, violist Martha Strongin Katz, and cellist Paul Katz. The group was initially called the \"New Cleveland Quartet.\" In 1971, the group left the Cleveland Institute because of disagreements over teaching loads and took up residency at the University at Buffalo, The State University of New York; they dropped the word \"New\" from their name at this time. In 1976 they made their final change of residency, moving to the Eastman School of Music in Rochester, New York. The quartet had three personnel changes: violist Atar Arad replaced Strongin Katz in 1980; violist James Dunham then replaced Arad in 1987; and William Preucil replaced Weilerstein as first violin in 1989. The quartet disbanded in 1995. Preucil became concertmaster of the Cleveland Orchestra, a position he still holds. Paul Katz, Martha Strongin Katz and Donald Weilerstein are on the faculty of the New England Conservatory of Music, and Weilerstein performs in a trio with his wife Vivian Hornik Weilerstein and his daughter, cellist Alisa Weilerstein; Peter Salaff is on the faculty of the Cleveland Institute of Music; Atar Arad teaches at the Jacobs School of Music at Indiana University; and James Dunham teaches at the Shepherd School of Music at Rice University.

Demolition 23.'s eponymous first album, Demolition 23., was recorded at Power Station Studios in New York City and produced by Little Steven. Monroe's former Hanoi Rocks bandmate Sami Yaffa played bass guitar on the album and the music was a return to Monroe and Yaffa's punk roots with tracks such as \"Same Shit Different Day\", \"Hammersmith Palais\" and covers of songs by Johnny Thunders, UK Subs and The Dead Boys. The album was dedicated to the memory of Stiv Bators and released on the Music For Nations label in 1994. In March 1995, Nasty Suicide announced his departure from the band much to the surprise of Michael Monroe who then decided to end the band."@en ;

Along with Loefah and Sgt.

BBC Radio 1 DJ John Peel was an early supporter of Digital Mystikz, eventually putting them in his annual 2004 Top 50 list at #29. They are among the scene's most famous producers. Their song \"Anti War Dub\" appeared in the 2006 film \"Children of Men\", although it wasn't included in the soundtrack. In the summer of 2008, Mala was chosen to headline the night portion of the Sonar Festival in Barcelona. In April 2011 Mala travelled to Cuba with Gilles Peterson who was returning to Havana to produce the second instalment in the 'Havana Cultura' series. While Peterson recorded new material with local musicians, Mala began work on a new album \"Mala In Cuba\", which was released in September 2012."@en ;

Their earlier music was very similar in style to countrymen Loudness and Anthem, but the band steered toward a poppier sound on later albums and dropped from worldwide view, preferring to record and tour in their home country. After a successful run, they broke up in 1994, but returned five years later and are still going strong today. Remarkably, the original quartet from the first album are still together. The band was named after the Y&T (Yesterday and Today) album. An early incarnation of the band included Minoru Niihara (of Loudness fame) as singer (originally bass and vocals)."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"During an exchange project in Vancouver, David Pino, singer of Wiseguy, met two Canadians who introduced him to alternative country. In exchange for a six-pack of beer and a tank full of gasoline, Pino obtained an acoustic guitar. Together with his Canadian accomplices, he traveled across the country playing for cash or free beers. Back in the Netherlands, he brought together like-minded musicians, and El Pino & the Volunteers was born. The band got together only every once in a while, and concerts were held on an incidental basis. After a couple of months of playing, the band started to become more serious. This newfound professionalism was solidified with the band\u2019s first EP Cougar. It was released in May 2005 by the small record label Stardumb. The EP sold out in no-time and received much praise in the Dutch music press. In December 2005, MTV aired a special on the band in its Brand New show. Pino decided to leave his main band Wiseguy to focus completely on El Pino & the Volunteers. In early 2006, the band was invited to the prestigious Noorderslag festival in Groningen. The press was enthusiastic, and praised the band for its musicianship(de Volkskrant). Dutch Excelsior Recordings, home of Johan, Daryll-Ann and GEM, signed the band immediately. El Pino & the Volunteers played at Club 3voor12 that February, recorded an Apers song for a tribute album in March, and performed at Motel Mozaique in April. And, in May, the band performed at the 10th anniversary party of Excelsior Recordings, together with several of their labelmates. In May and June the band recorded 16 tracks for its debut album, which Reyn Ouwehand produced. On August 31, the album, named Molten City, was presented in Rotown in Rotterdam. The album was received well by the music press, becoming album of the week at 3voor12 (link). In September and October the band supported Johan during their Dutch club tour. The band rounded out the year by performing at the Fine Fine Music tour in December 2006. The next record, also produced by Reyn Ouwehand, was released November 16, 2009."@en ;

In the spring of 2006 the band in its present and permanent line up started playing shows around Long Beach and Los Angeles. \"There was a time, before I put the record out, that I wasn\u2019t playing in Mars Volta anymore, and I had just bought a bunch of recording instruments. I\u2019d always wanted to record my own record but never did, so [Free Moral Agents] really started with just me. I knew J, who was actually my girlfriend at the time\u2019s brother-in-law, who did poetry and sang and stuff, so I got together with him. This is before the vinyl. I was working at this record store and started talking to my friend Jeff Harris, who it turns out, was really good with Pro Tools, so I added him to the group. He\u2019s really a producer and doesn\u2019t really play with us live, but he\u2019s very much responsible for the sound of the record. I knew Mendee [Ichikawa] for several years, and we had worked on and off, but I knew we needed a female element to the group, so that\u2019s basically what Free Moral Agents is right there. As far as the music goes, it started as my project, but these people who I know I can trust, really bring it together.\" The group is currently finishing its 2nd full length entitled Control This for Gold Standard Laboratories. In April 2009, Owens released two live tracks for free."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Habana Abierta is a Cuban band. They are a member of a generation of composers, musicians, sculptors, authors, actors, etc. which emerged in the early 90s with its own identity in Havana, even though some of their creations had already been well known for some years in the island's cultural circles. The origins of Habana Abierta go back to a personal project of music duo Gema y P\u00E1vel, who wanted to produce a compilation of everything they and their peers had been doing in Havana clubs with hardly any resources. Initially, Luis Alberto Barber\u00EDa, Pepe del Valle, Carlos Santos, Boris Larramendi, Superavit, Andy Villal\u00F3n, Kelvis Ochoa and Jos\u00E9 Luis Medina, backed by the NUBENEGRA recording label, gave us a first glimpse released under the name Habana Oculta. In July 1996 most of them travelled to Spain (except for Carlos Santos, Ra\u00FAl Ciro and Alejandro Fr\u00F3meta: Super\u00E1vit) to showcase their music at several festivals and clubs, and very soon spurred interest among audiences and the media alike, and even well-known Spanish artists and musicians. Ana Bel\u00E9n and V\u00EDctor Manuel, along with Ketama, were the first to show an interest and to take the initiative in a gradual and rich exchange with our Habana Abierta, which whom they made music in Spain. BMG Ariola asked Gema y P\u00E1vel to come up with a project bringing a group of highly different singer-songwriters together on the album, based on the individuality of each member yet with combined expression of the diverse unity of Cuban music. Then Vanito Brown and Alejandro Guti\u00E9rrez joined what was to become Habana Abierta, recording a new album under this name. They played over 80 gigs throughout Spain in 1997, 50 of them in Madrid and in 1998 recorded am album with the line-up down to 6, as Andy and Barber\u00EDa had left to branch out on their own. With 24 Horas, the second album with Habana Abierta, an eclectic line was followed with some tracks from previous recordings, with a more defined fusion between popular Cuban music and funk, reggae and hip-hop. Rock and Pop Cuban-style with national roots: Van Van by Juan Fromel, Irakere by Chucho Vald\u00E9s or NG la Banda by Jos\u00E9 Luis Cort\u00E9s, refrains attributed to Matamoros over Red Hot Chili Peppers or Rolling Stones riffs. Conga-funk, timba-rock, bolero-hop, chachacha-blues, son and pop.... In January 2003, after six years in Spain, they returned to Cuba for a series of sell-out individual shows, with a performance by the Habana Abierta full line-up at La Tropical, playing to with over 10,000 people. This gave rise to the Habana Abierta documentary directed by Jorge Perugorr\u00EDa and Arturo Soto, which was presented at several film festivals."@en ;

The idea to form a supergroup originated in 2000 on the Tattoo the Earth tour, although plans were constantly put on hold due to scheduling conflicts. The summer of 2006 allowed the band to take the project seriously and record its first album. Recorded at Chasin' Jason studio in Dimebag Darrell's backyard, a self-titled album was completed in roughly one month. Released on April 10, 2007, the album entered the Billboard 200 at number 9, selling 45,000 copies. AllMusic reviewer William Ruhlmann stated the album is \"a competent example of its genre\" awarding the album three and a half stars."@en ;

KONK's musical influences ranged from Afrobeat, jazz, and funk to hip hop. Given these influence KONK's style is noted as being highly percussive, and containing simple, yet strong, backing bass lines. As part of New York\u2019s post-punk dance scene they regularly played alongside groups such as Liquid Liquid, Bush Tetras, ESG, The Peech Boys and The Lounge Lizards. They have been featured in a recent book by David Byrne and others on the New York post-punk scene."@en ;

The group currently comprises Rob Thomas (lead vocals, piano, rhythm guitar), Brian Yale (bass), and Paul Doucette (lead and rhythm guitar, drums, backing vocals). Matchbox Twenty rose to international fame with their debut album, Yourself or Someone Like You (1996), which was certified 12\u00D7 Platinum (diamond) in the United States and multi-platinum in Australia, Canada and New Zealand. Their second album, Mad Season, released in 2000, charted in the top three on the Billboard 200 and was certified 4\u00D7 Platinum in the United States. Their third album, More Than You Think You Are, released in 2002, was only certified 2x Platinum in the United States, despite its singles receiving significant airplay. Director Bill Draheim documented the band throughout the process while making More Than You Think You Are. The documentary \"Theresville\" was an online extra. The band then went on hiatus in 2004, with rhythm guitarist Adam Gaynor leaving the band in 2005 after performing on the first three studio albums. As a result, Paul Doucette took over rhythm guitar, and the band reunited and released a compilation album, Exile on Mainstream, in 2007, which was certified Gold in the United States. After the release, former Push Stars drummer Ryan MacMillan filled Doucette's vacated drum spot. During this period, Rob Thomas embarked on a successful solo career. Matchbox Twenty then took another hiatus, but reunited again in 2010. The band released North, their fourth album, on September 4, 2012 which made its debut at number one on the Billboard 200."@en ;

Prior to the release of their first album, they opened for Switchfoot, The Fray, Will Hoge, Pete Yorn, Blue October, and many others on several different nationwide tours. In October 2007, original guitarist Will Mason announced his departure from the band. The Inside failed to make a major splash in the market, so Moses Mayfield began to write in hopes of creating a followup to their critically acclaimed major label release. Unfortunately due to a realignment of personal goals the band decided to take an indefinite hiatus in December 2007. Not long after the band broke up, lead singer Matthew Mayfield started playing shows centered on the Birmingham, AL area, usually solo acoustic but occasionally with a new backing band. Within a year, he independently released an album of acoustic songs, including acoustic versions of songs that previously appeared on The Inside. He also revealed that Moses Mayfield called it quits mainly due to disagreements with the record label, as well as some members deciding they wanted to leave the band due to these disagreements. A combination of those two items led to the sudden break-up."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"OneRepublic is an American pop rock band formed in Colorado Springs, Colorado in 2002 by lead vocalist Ryan Tedder and guitarist Zach Filkins. It also currently consists of guitarist Drew Brown, bassist and cellist Brent Kutzle, and drummer Eddie Fisher. The band first achieved commercial success on Myspace as an unsigned act. In late 2003, after OneRepublic played shows throughout the Los Angeles area, a number of record labels approached the band with interest, but OneRepublic ultimately signed with Velvet Hammer, an imprint of Columbia Records. They made their first album with producer Greg Wells during the summer and fall of 2005 at his studio, Rocket Carousel, in Culver City, California. The album was originally scheduled for release on June 6, 2006, but the group was dropped by Columbia two months before the album ever came out. The lead single of that album, \"Apologize\", was released on April 30, 2006 on Myspace and received some recognition there, becoming number one on the Myspace charts. In 2007, OneRepublic released their debut album, Dreaming Out Loud. Its lead single, \"Apologize\", was notably remixed by Timbaland, becoming a huge international success, reaching number one in sixteen countries and subsequently earning them a Grammy Award nomination. The second single, \"Stop and Stare\", mirrored its predecessor's success. The album was later certified Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). The band's second album, Waking Up (2009), produced the singles \"All the Right Moves\", \"Secrets\", \"Marchin On\", and \"Good Life\", with the latter reaching the top ten of the US Billboard Hot 100. OneRepublic's third album, Native (2013), became the band's first top ten album on the Billboard 200, and highest charting album to date, charting at number four. The lead single, \"If I Lose Myself\", charted within the top ten in several countries, while the album's third single, \"Counting Stars\", became the band's most successful single in recent years, obtaining top five placements in Australia, Canada, Germany, Ireland, New Zealand, the U.S. and the UK. This marks their highest charting single in the United Kingdom to date. It has also peaked at number 2 on the US Billboard Hot 100, matching their highest peak of \"Apologize\" in 2007. On October 7, 2016, OneRepublic released Oh My My, their fourth studio album, which featured a variety of guests. It was recognized as a change in their sound and was supported by the singles \"Wherever I Go\" and \"Kids\". On October 16, 2016, One Republic appeared live on ITV's X-Factor's results show."@en ;

DBX was a pet project of Gwar and showed some of their earlier punk roots from the \"Death Piggy\" era. At their shows they played some original DBX songs as well as some tunes from Death Piggy, Gwar, and X-Cops. The band enjoyed a following mostly made up of Gwar fans. Dave Brockie hinted at the possibility of the band's breakup in the past due to the exhausting nature of lower-budget touring. In February 2008, several sources reported that the band would be touring as an opening act for the reunited Green Jell\u00FF. Dave Brockie stated, on his website, that this was not the case and there were no official discussions concerning the tour. DBX played two reunion shows in August 2009. In a more recent interview with Dave Brockie he explained a new DBX album was \"possible\" but said his main priority then was Gwar. Brockie died of a heroin overdose in March 2014."@en ;
