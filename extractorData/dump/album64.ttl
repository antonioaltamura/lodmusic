Some tracks are shortened edits, and some are also subject to very slight alteration and remastering; Voigt noted around the time of release that the music seemed to resist attempts at cleaning up the recordings, with the muffled or lo-fi nature of some elements of the music forming an integral part of the characteristic Gas sound. The tracks were originally released on the label Mille Plateaux. The albums start with 1996's self-titled album and end with 2000's Pop. The album is filled with vague sounds recalling the ideals of minimalism. The box set reached #13 on the Billboard Top World Music Albums chart."@en ;

This album is the first from his new record label Starfaith Records, which is distributed by Sony Music Entertainment, owners of most of Santana's albums (except those recorded for Polydor Records which are owned by Universal Music Group). It is also the first album since 1992's Milagro that does not feature guest singers in any of the songs, a style that characterized Santana's albums since Supernatural. The album contains only one song with vocals (\"Eres La Luz\"). The track \"Mr. Szabo\" is a homage to the Hungarian guitarist G\u00E1bor Szab\u00F3, who released a series of 8 albums for Impulse Records between 1966 and 1967, and one of Carlos Santana's early idols, and features a similar rhythmical and harmonic structure to \"Gypsy Queen\", a Szab\u00F3 hit from 1966 covered by Santana in 1970 as a medley with Fleetwood Mac's \"Black Magic Woman\"."@en ;

Originally titled All About Y'all, the album was slated for release in mid-2006 after the release of its debut single \"Favorite State of Mind\". However the album release was delayed when the debut single failed to perform strongly on radio. A second single, \"I Keep Coming Back\", was issued in early 2007, and the album's name was changed to I Keep Coming Back. This single similarly failed to perform well. The album was finally issued on April 1, 2008 as a limited release, following the release of its title track which was a top 10 hit. Overall, the album's five singles have all charted in the Top 40 on the Hot Country Songs charts, including the number ten title track. Next came \"Unbelievable (Ann Marie)\" (a song that Josh Gracin wrote about his wife), which peaked at number 36, his least successful single to date, and \"Telluride\", which was previously recorded by Tim McGraw on his 2001 album Set This Circus Down, which peaked at number 34. \"I Don't Want to Live\" was recorded as \"I Don't Wanna Live\" by Chris Cagle on his 2008 album My Life's Been a Country Song. The album debuted at number four on the Billboard Top Country Albums chart. Sales of We Weren't Crazy failed to meet those of Gracin's debut, with 18,000 units sold on its first week. He parted company with Lyric Street in April 2009 after the single \"Telluride\"'s poor performance on the chart."@en ;

It is the follow-up to his second album Life, as well has his longest album to date; however, Exodus is over 3 minutes longer, so if the album was reissued on two discs, it would be. Any reissues for any of Andy's albums is yet to be confirmed. The album was brought with much critical acclaim. \"Stars\", a collaboration with Mark Underdown, was the main, and only, single off the album. Differently from his previous two album releases, which were mainly focused on the EDM genre, the songs on Colour display a more accessible and commercially oriented sound, closer to synthpop: although elements of EDM and industrial rock are still present, the rhythms are essentially slower and quieter, and the Nine Inch Nails-like influences are less prominent than in his previous releases. The more pop-oriented feel is evident, among other examples, on the song \"Smile\", featuring Scottish singer-songwriter Midge Ure. The lyrics, all self-penned by Hunter, are Christian-themed as always in his work, with the word \"you\" referring only to God, even if written without a capital Y."@en ;

dbr:Desde_El_Principio	rdf:type	schema:MusicAlbum ;
	dbo:abstract	"Desde El Principio is the twelfth studio album by Spanish duo Az\u00FAcar Moreno, released on Sony International in 2004. The album saw the Salazar sisters joining forces with a new production team; drummer and percussionist Sergio Castillo and keyboardist Francisco Amat. Castillo and Amat began their career in music in the early 1980s and had previously produced albums with among others Cuban singer Silvio Rodr\u00EDguez, Tunisian-French Dany Brillant, and in the late 90s and early 2000s most notably the young Spanish rumba-rock duo Estopa to great success. Productionwise Desde El Principio marked a return to Az\u00FAcar Moreno's winning formula of the early 90s in that it mixed mainstream Latin pop with material from a wide variety of genres. Tracks like \"Sangre Espa\u00F1ola\", \"Me Quedo Contigo\" and \"Vamos a Dejarlo As\u00ED\" mainly featured drums, percussion and Spanish guitars, recorded live, while lead single \"Mi Ritmo\" was a typical Az\u00FAcar Moreno dance track with a more synthesized and contemporary urban sound. Just like 1991's Mambo the album also featured flamenco/dance covers of a number of pop classics like \"Don't Let Me Be Misunderstood\", a hit for both Nina Simone and The Animals in the 60s and also turned into disco classic by Santa Esmeralda in 1977, the Neapolitan traditional \"\u00A1Oh Sole M\u00EDo!\", also covered by Elvis Presley in English as \"It's Now Or Never\", but, Az\u00FAcar Moreno's large LGBT following in both Europe and South America considered, most importantly their take on Gloria Gaynor's 1979 gay anthem \"I Will Survive\", retitled \"Sobrevivir\u00E9\". Despite this Desde El Principio proved to be a modest commercial success. \"Mi Ritmo\" was somewhat surprisingly the first Az\u00FAcar Moreno lead single since the late 1980s to be issued without any accompanying dance remixes, and the follow-up's \"Sobrevivir\u00E9\", \"Se Me Va\" and \"El\" were never commercially released, but only as promo singles distributed to radio stations and disc jockeys - again without any remixes; in Spain the album sold some 50.000 copies, making it their first studio album since 1988's Carne De Melocot\u00F3n not to go platinum or multi-platinum in their home country. Desde El Principio also came to be the duo's final album for the Sony Music Entertainment label, a company they after a series of mergers in various forms had been signed to for some fifteen years (CBS Records Spain, Epic Records Spain, CBS-Epic Spain, eventually a sublabel to Sony Music Spain, today a subsidiary to the multinational Sony BMG Music Entertainment conglomerate). In 2006 Az\u00FAcar Moreno returned to their previous label EMI Music for the album Bailando Con Lola. While Sony Music have continued to release hits compilations with Az\u00FAcar Moreno all through the 2000s, such as Toda La Pasi\u00F3n De Az\u00FAcar Moreno (2001), Colecci\u00F3n De Oro (2002), 20 Grandes Exitos (2003), Los Esenciales (2003) and 20 Exitos Originales (2005), as well as numerous mid-price collections, none of these include any new recordings, remixes or tracks not to be found on the duo's ten studio albums for the CBS/Epic/Sony label, several of the duo's greatest hits do however appear in edited form."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"40/40 (originally subtitled The Best Selection) is a two-disc compilation by American pop group The Carpenters. The album features 40 songs which span their entire career (10 of them were determined by Japanese fan voting), and first issued by Universal Japan on April 22, 2009 (forty years after they signed to A&M Records). It was issued worldwide half a year later, leaving out its subtitle. The cover art was taken from the photo sessions for the album Horizon, showing a healthy and glowing Karen and Richard. A television spot aired for the album, prominently featuring the famous \"Carpenters\" logo. Included in this set is the original, long version of a UK top-10 hit \"Calling Occupants of Interplanetary Craft\", and their last top-20 U.S. hit \"Touch Me When We're Dancing\". In Japan, 40/40 received a commercial success upon its release. It debuted and peaked at the number-three position on the Japanese Oricon, making them one of the Western artists with the most top-ten albums in the history of that country's chart (following Madonna and The Beatles, tying with Queen, The Rolling Stones and Paul McCartney/Wings). The album also charted in the UK, peaking at #21 in November 2009. The original Japanese release was pressed on the SHM-CD (super high material CD) with improved sound, while the cheaper international edition was issued on the standard CD format. One other change is that the Japanese track listing included \"Leave Yesterday Behind\" while the standard worldwide release substituted \"Touch Me When We're Dancing\"."@en ;

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Casey_Abrams_(album)>	rdf:type	schema:MusicAlbum ;
	dbo:abstract	"Casey Abrams is the self-titled debut album of jazz-pop artist and American Idol season ten sixth-place finalist Casey Abrams. It was released through the jazz label Concord Records on June 26, 2012, one year after Abrams competed on the Fox reality television series. The record deal was struck with the help of American Idol judge Randy Jackson, who serves as an executive producer on this album. Abrams spent six weeks recording the songs at Kensaltown Studios in London. He described this as an unusual experience, in which he often sang while sitting on a couch and recorded in an open room. Ambient noises from the city can be heard in the background of some tracks. Abrams served as a co-writer on nine of the album's eleven tracks and, for the most part, felt that his creative vision was communicated. The album carries an upbeat tone. It predominately focuses on themes of nature and romantic yearning. Humorous subject matter is dealt with as well, such as in the songs \"Wore Out My Soul\", which is a double entendre about shoes, and \"Stuck in London\", which contains nonsense lyrics. Although Abrams had been known for jazz on American Idol, he went in a pop direction for this album, combining the two genres. \"Dry Spell\" has been considered the most jazz-influenced original song. However, a cover of the Ray Charles standard \"Hit the Road Jack\" is included as well and features a duet with fellow American Idol season 10 contestant Haley Reinhart. A deluxe version of the album, which includes covers of \"Eleanor Rigby\" and \"Have You Ever Seen the Rain?\", received a limited release. Touring for the album was not extensive. However, Abrams opened a jazz festival on Penang Island, and after being dropped by Concord Records, he toured across Ethiopia. \"Simple Life\" and \"Get Out\" were released as dual singles a few weeks ahead of the album. Music videos were created for the two songs, as well as for non-singles \"Stuck in London\" and \"Great Bright Morning\". Jack Black, who had previously performed with Abrams on the American Idol season finale, appeared in a promotional comedy video that depicted Abrams as a homeless street busker. Some critics were disappointed that Abrams did not make a more traditional jazz album. However, critical reception was positive overall. Some reviews compared Abrams to Jason Mraz, while others singled out the two jazziest songs, \"Dry Spell and \"Hit the Road Jack\", as highlights. \"Midnight Girl\" also received high praise. It was listed as one 2012's best songs by an American Idol alumni. The album charted at No. 101 on the Billboard 200. It peeked at the No. 1 spot on Billboard's Top Heatseekers chart, while the single \"Get Out\" peaked at No. 23 on the Adult Contemporary chart and No. 39 on the Adult Pop Songs chart."@en ;

Keith Buckley offered the following on the video: \"We worked with director Robert Schober who has done incredible work for Mastodon, Deftones, Metallica and now, us. The clip has a very ambiguously creepy David Lynch vibe to it and might be the first time we've never included a single one of our instruments in lieu of a story line that exists outside of us as members of a band. It's dark and weird and while not completely adhering thematically to the lyrics, it sets a larger, broader mood which marries the song perfectly.\" Director Robert \"Robo\" Schober adds, \"The video is a surrealist crime drama set on a lost highway...the story loosely interprets key phrases from the song...the guys were awesome and put up with many hours of freezing temperatures in the middle of the desert.\" \"Ex Lives\" debuted on the Billboard 200 at #20 selling around 14,300 copies.

Musically the album is a pop album with elements of electropop and trip hop. \"Girl Who Got Away\" received generally positive reviews from music critics, who complimented \" folky midtempo melody\" and Dido's vocal performances, while others stated that the album didn't \"break any new ground\". The album commercially fared well; it debuted at number five in the United Kingdom, giving Dido her fourth album to do so. The album peaked at number two on the Swiss and German album charts and at number thirty two on the US Billboard 200 and has sold almost 500,000 copies worldwide. The album also charted within the top twenty of the Australian, Irish and New Zealand charts. The album was preceded by promotional single \"Let Us Move On\" featuring Kendrick Lamar, whilst the album's lead single \"No Freedom\" was released in January 2013 and charted at number fifty-one on the UK Singles Chart. The second single \"End of Night\" was released in May 2013, however the single failed to chart at all in the United Kingdom but did make appearances on the Belgium charts. To further promote the album Dido did a series of live performances and radio shows making appearances on Jimmy Kimmel Live!, Heart London, Magic Radio, and BBC Radio 2."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Powertrippin' is the third studio album released by Scottish heavy metal band The Almighty. It was released in the United Kingdom in 1993 by Polydor Records and was the band's last studio album for that label. It was The Almighty's first album with new guitarist Pete Friesen who replaced founding guitarist Tantrum who had left the band in 1992. Friesen contributed to the songwriting and was a major part of the new sound presented on this album, introducing a heavier, riff based grunge sound compared to the punk leanings of earlier efforts. The subject of the cover art is taken directly from a psychedelic concert poster for MC5 designed by the legendary poster artist Gary Grimshaw in 1966. Three singles were released from the album in multiple formats in 1993. \"Addiction\" (CD, 12\" vinyl), \"Out of Season\" (2-CD, 7\" vinyl & 12\" vinyl) and \"Over the Edge\" (CD, Cassette, 12\" & 7\" vinyl). The album was re-released in the United Kingdom and later in Japan with a bonus disc which contained a live show from August 22, 1992 at Donington Park. An EP that was released in Japan only contains 4 live track from The Almighty's 1993 European tour supporting Iron Maiden. The EP is called Liveblood and also has 2 studio tracks called \"F***in' Up\" (a Neil Young cover) and \"In a Rut\" which is also a cover.

The album, in general, received very positive reviews, despite the fact that the latest work of the band has been considered by many as dark and frightening. Even though Tomorrow's Eve fans described the album as something the band has not attempted before, Tales From Serpentia is said to be a very standard progressive metal album. For the first time the band produced an album that bares a concept, that connects a number of completely independent stories, which deal with various troubles of everyday life, such as grief, drug abuse and violence. The album also features a number of songs that start with a spoken part by a random person or a group of people, discussing the problems these people are dealing with at the moment."@en ;

Compositions from the album have been broadcast on several stations, including Public Radio Exchange, WDAV, New England Public Radio (WFCR) and Northwest Public Radio. WFCR broadcast the Tchaikovsky recording in November 2011 in recognition of DePreist's 75th birthday, and the Berlioz track in February 2013, following DePreist's death.

	dbo:abstract	"30 Trips Around the Sun is an 80-CD live album, packaged as a box set, by the rock band the Grateful Dead. Announced for the celebration of their 50th anniversary, it consists of 30 complete, previously unreleased concerts\u201473 hours of music\u2014with one show per year from 1966 through 1995. The box set is individually numbered and limited to 6,500 copies. It was released on October 7, 2015. The package also includes a gold-colored vinyl 7-inch single which bookends the band's career. The A-side is \"Caution (Do Not Stop on Tracks)\" from the band's earliest recording session in 1965, with a B-side of the last song the band ever performed together live, \"Box of Rain\" recorded during their final encore at Soldier Field in Chicago on July 9, 1995. Also contained in the box set is a 288-page book that includes an extensive essay about the history of the Grateful Dead by band archivist Nicholas Meriwether, and a scroll that has \"a visual representation of how the band's live repertoire has evolved through the years\". All of the concerts were essentially previously unreleased. However, two tracks from the July 3, 1966 performance (\"Gangster of Love\" & \"Don't Mess Up a Good Thing\") previously appeared on Rare Cuts and Oddities, and one track (\"Candyman\") from April 15, 1970 is a bonus track on American Beauty. The seven-inch B-side, \"Box of Rain\", was previously released on the CD accompanying early prints of Phil Lesh's book Searching for the Sound, while another track from that July 9, 1995 performance (\"So Many Roads\") was released on So Many Roads. A USB drive version of the collection was released December 11, 2015. It is shaped like a gold lightning bolt with the Grateful Dead 50th anniversary logo engraved on the side. The drive includes all of the music from the collection in both FLAC (96/24) and MP3 formats and is an individually numbered limited edition of 1,000 copies. There is also a 4-CD album that was released September 18, 2015, with one song from each of the 30 concerts, plus the 1965 recording of \"Caution\". That album is called 30 Trips Around the Sun: The Definitive Live Story 1965\u20131995."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Molly Malone \u2013 Balade irlandaise is an album by French singer-songwriter Renaud, released on 23 November 2009 on EMI Records. It is a collection of traditional-style Irish folk songs translated into French, an idea that had been maturing in Renaud's mind for almost two decades. Renaud had previously used Irish influences in his 1991 album Marchand de cailloux and did a low-key tour playing in Irish pubs in 1997. The album was recorded at the Windmill Lane Studios in Dublin. It was produced by Frenchman Thomas Davidson Noton and arranged and mixed by Irish musician Pete Briquette, formerly the bass player with The Boomtown Rats. Accompanying musicians includes Terry Woods of The Pogues and musicians from Steeleye Span. Despite mixed reviews in the press, Molly Malone \u2013 Balade irlandaise entered the French charts at number one in November 2009. It also reached the top 5 on the albums chart in the French-speaking part of Belgium. The album title \"Molly Malone\" is assumed to be partly chosen as a reference to Renaud's son Malone.[citation needed] The second half of the title, \"Balade irlandaise\", is a play on words between \"balade\" (a stroll) and \"ballade\" (a ballad)."@en ;

As Pagani revealed in an interview within the 2011 DVD biographical documentary series Dentro Faber (i.e. Inside Faber, the latter being De Andr\u00E9's nickname in Genoese), he is responsible for the writing of most of the music, while De Andr\u00E9 wrote all of the lyrics, except for Don Raffa\u00E8, detailed below, whose lyric writing is shared between De Andr\u00E9 and singer-songwriter Massimo Bubola. Pagani's collaboration with De Andr\u00E9, always according to the Lombard musician, happened in an identical way for De Andr\u00E9's previous album, Cr\u00EAuza de m\u00E4, with Pagani setting to music De Andr\u00E9's already fully written lyrics, on the basis of a few melodic ideas from the latter. His next collaboration, with fellow Genoan Ivano Fossati on Anime salve, would be more equally balanced, with he and Fossati composing music by actually playing together."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"2gether is the second studio album by South Korean pop rock band CNBLUE. It was released on September 14, 2015, under FNC Entertainment. After ending domestic promotions for Can't Stop (2014), the band concentrated on individual activities; most notably, vocalist Jung Yong-hwa released his debut solo album One Fine Day (2015) in January. The remaining band members sought out opportunities in television, particularly in acting, variety show appearances, and MCing. In August 2015, it was announced that CNBLUE would release its second studio album after an absence lasting one year and seven months. With 2gether, the band decided to change the direction of their music; they stripped themselves of the acoustic tracks they are known for and explored electronic dance music in order to create a particular color and form a distinctive sound. After a series of photo and video teasers, the album and lead single \"Cinderella\" were released simultaneously. The band held a \"Be My Cinderella\" album showcase on the day of release and began promoting the album through music chart programs across various television networks by performing \"Cinderella\" and other album tracks. The single ultimately led the band to win a total of five music show trophies: two consecutive wins on both SBS MTV's The Show and Korean Broadcasting System's (KBS) Music Bank, and one on MBC Music's Show Champion. 2gether was met with generally favorable reviews, particularly in the band's pursuit of electronic elements. The album went on to top the Gaon Album Chart in its second week of its release and has sold 83,000 copies since its release. The band embarked on the 2015 CNBLUE Live \"Come Together\" concert tour, which will make stops in South Korea, China, and other Asian countries."@en ;

That We Can Play contains six songs, including four original Games tracks (one, the opener \"Strawberry Skies\", with vocals by Laurel Halo). It also has two remixes: a remix of \"Strawberry Skies\" by the Chicago duo Gatekeeper and a reprise of a song by Canadian musician CFCF. The EP, released in November 2010 on the Hippos in Tanks label, was promoted with music videos and singles. It was well-received by critics, who appreciated the duo's use of its 1980s power-pop influences, and made the top ten of MP3 blog Gorilla vs. Bear's year-end list."@en ;

After receiving a remix of \"On and On\" from producer Zach Witness, Badu contacted him in order to record with him, shortly after the pair met again and went to Witness's home in Dallas, Texas and worked in his bedroom studio, where they recorded the album in 11 days. Described by Badu as \"TRap & B\", the mixtape takes influence from, hip hop, R&B, jazz, and art rock, with lyrics that focus on the themes of communication, notably through phones, with lyrics that touch upon ideas of \"missed connections, call waiting, answering machines\". The mixtape debuted at number 14 on the Billboard 200, selling 35,000 equivalent album units in its first week."@en ;

The photocopied booklet (on recycled paper) accompanying the CD explains the importance of People First and self-advocacy generally through several articles and a breakdown of where the proceeds go. The compilation is not endorsed by People First. As for the music, Finding a Voice\u2019s strongest suit is the snapshot it presents of the Missoula punk scene circa 1999. Comp coordinator Jeremy Rossman (aka Blimpie el Guapo) first started soliciting submissions from local, regional, and farther-afield bands around that year. Bands featured on the album from Missoula include: Humpy, The Sputniks, The Helltones, The Everyday Sinners, The Cleaners, Spanker and Sasshole. From surrounding Flathead County, Montana: Disgruntled Nation and The Vagrants. A partial list of bands from other areas: The Dread, Laceration, Oldmanhomo, Elmer, Choking Victim, Leftover Crack, and Lopez (Portland, OR). Originally intended as a double LP and long delayed by one thing or another, Finding a Voice was finally released in CD form in February, 2003. Many of the local bands were recorded in their basements, bathrooms and practice pads by John Brownell of the Oblio Joes on his portable eight-track. Brownell was owner and operator of Repetitively Futile Records, the label in charge of the compilation. Brownell stated on his label's page:"@en ;

While its lyrics focus mainly on themes of romance, perseverance and devotion, Return of the Tender Lover incorporates pop-soul love songs as well as elements of old-school R&B that evokes some his earlier work. As a result, the album received generally positive reviews from critics who praised the album's production, songwriting and direction. \"We've Got Love\" was released as the album's lead single on August 4, 2015. Return of The Tender Lover is the singer's first solo album since Playlist (2007), and his first consisting of only original material since Grown & Sexy (2005)."@en ;

ns33:_Live_at_the_Z7	rdf:type	schema:MusicAlbum ;
	dbo:abstract	"Second Flight: Live at the Z7 is the second live album by American progressive rock supergroup Flying Colors. The band recorded it on October 12, 2014 at the Z7 Konzertfabrik in Pratteln, Switzerland. Mike Portnoy chose the location because both Flying Colors and other bands of his had recorded multiple shows at the 013 in Tilburg. It was a challenging show for the band to perform because this was only the eighth show on the tour. The album title was coined by Portnoy. Bernhard Baran, who had filmed and edited Flying Colors' Live in Europe, returned to undertake this production. Executive producer Bill Evans requested a larger production than the previous release, resulting in 24 cameras being used; most of them being GoPro cameras attached to band members' instruments. The band used new audio and video technology on this release. Evans and his assistant engineer, Tom Price, developed and employed new technology that had never been used for live concert release, in conjunction with mix engineer Rich Mouser. Critics place it among the best-sounding live albums ever made. One feature allowed the viewer to move between the two different locations in the venue which he felt had the best sound: the front row, and behind the front-of-house console. Z7 Konzertfabrik supplied blueprints for the venue; Evans and mix engineer Rich Mouser (who had run front-of-house sound for the show) designed two surround mixes to simulate both listening positions. The audio setup menu on the DVD and Blu-ray versions showed the Z7 blueprint, and displayed the listener's current position. Another feature was a mix created specifically for headphones. Originally, this was to be the front-row surround mix. However, the results were not satisfactory. Evans and Price then worked with Mouser to create a 3D audio headphone mix wherein each sound source was uniquely positioned in a virtual 3D field around the listener. Price noted that this type of mix was significant because an increasing number of people listened to music on headphones, instead of speakers. The mix was not complete at release time for the main album. The final feature was a new mixing technology, Harmonic Phrase Analysis. Developed as part of Evans' PhD, the technology \"\u2026reduces the unwanted processing normally associated with contemporary live recordings, imparting a more organic feel to the sound field.\" Evans spent six months, full time, with Price, developing the technology, and applying it to all the tracks of Second Flight: Live at the Z7. Mouser spent 34 days creating four separate mixes and 10 separate masters, and then mastered each recording. Three live music videos were released at 4K resolution: \u201CMask Machine\u201D, \"Kayla\", and \"Bombs Away.\""@en ;

dbr:To_All_New_Arrivals	rdf:type	schema:MusicAlbum ;
	dbo:abstract	"To All New Arrivals is the 5th studio album by dance music act Faithless. The album was created after the positive response to the Faithless Greatest Hits tour, originally described as their \"final tour\".[citation needed] The album was released on 27 November 2006, a week after the single Bombs. The title for the album was inspired by the recent birth of two babies to band members Rollo and Sister Bliss. Lead singer Maxi Jazz loved the title, partly due to his Buddhist faith and partly due to his parents being new arrivals to the UK in the 1950s. The tagline for the album are lyrics taken from the song \"Music Matters\" In one notable collaboration, the track \"Spiders, Crocodiles & Kryptonite\" features the vocals of Robert Smith of post-punk group The Cure. The song also contains samples and a section of arrangement from The Cure hit \"Lullaby\". The album was supported by a tour of all of the United Kingdom's major arenas which began in Nottingham on 17 March 2007. It entered the UK album chart at #30 for the week ending 3 December 2006. Given that their previous studio album, No Roots, entered the charts at #1, this position was seen as a disappointment. Unlike the original versions of Faithless' previous studio albums, initially this album was not released in the United States. However, a \"Deluxe Version\" appeared on the U.S. iTunes Store on 4 November 2007. The album cover features the 1880 oil painting, Nightfall on the Thames, by John Atkinson Grimshaw."@en ;

dbr:Are_You_Experienced	rdf:type	schema:MusicAlbum ;
	dbo:abstract	"Are You Experienced is the debut studio album by English-American rock band the Jimi Hendrix Experience. Released in 1967, the LP was an immediate critical and commercial success, and it is widely regarded as one of the greatest debuts in the history of rock music. The album features Jimi Hendrix's innovative approach to songwriting and electric guitar playing which soon established a new direction in psychedelic and hard rock music. By mid-1966, Hendrix was struggling to earn a living playing the R&B circuit as a backing guitarist. After being referred to Chas Chandler, who was leaving the Animals and interested in managing and producing artists, Hendrix was signed to a management and production contract with Chandler and ex-Animals manager Michael Jeffery. Chandler brought Hendrix to London and began recruiting members for a band designed to showcase the guitarist's talents, the Jimi Hendrix Experience. In late October, after having been rejected by Decca Records, the Experience signed with Track, a new label formed by the Who's managers Kit Lambert and Chris Stamp. Are You Experienced and its preceding singles were recorded over a five-month period from late October 1966 through early April 1967. The album was completed in sixteen recording sessions at three London locations, including De Lane Lea Studios, CBS, and Olympic. Released in the UK on May 12, 1967, Are You Experienced spent 33 weeks on the charts, peaking at number two. The album was issued in the US on August 23 by Reprise Records, where it reached number five on the Billboard 200, remaining on the chart for 106 weeks, 27 of those in the Top 40. The US version contained some of Hendrix's best known songs, including the Experience's first three singles, which, though omitted from the British edition of the LP, were top ten hits in the UK: \"Purple Haze\", \"Hey Joe\", and \"The Wind Cries Mary\". In 2005, Rolling Stone ranked Are You Experienced fifteenth on its list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time. They placed four songs from the album on their list of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time: \"Purple Haze\" (17), \"Foxy Lady\" (153), \"Hey Joe\" (201), and \"The Wind Cries Mary\" (379). That same year, the record was one of 50 recordings chosen by the Library of Congress in recognition of its cultural significance to be added to the National Recording Registry. Writer and archivist Rueben Jackson of the Smithsonian Institution wrote: \"it's still a landmark recording because it is of the rock, R&B, blues ... musical tradition. It altered the syntax of the music ... in a way I compare to James Joyce's Ulysses.\""@en ;

Ataxia consisted of then-Red Hot Chili Peppers guitarist John Frusciante, Joe Lally of Fugazi, and Josh Klinghoffer, Frusciante's subsequent successor in the Red Hot Chili Peppers. The band recorded 10 songs, approximately 80 minutes of content, over a two-week period, and played two live shows in a matter of four days. A second album, entitled AW II, was released on May 29, 2007 with the remaining five tracks recorded during this session. The vinyl edition of the record saw a repressing from Record Collection on December 11, 2012. These reissued records are 180 gram and come with a download of choice between MP3 and WAV formats of the album. Regarding this release, Frusciante noted, \"If you like me cause you saw me live, and I was beating the fuck out of my guitar, then this record - which is a collaboration with Josh Klinghoffer and Joe Lally - will give you what you're looking for. If you don't care about song structure, and you want powerful music with fucked-up guitar-playing and songs that are really long, this record is the one.\""@en ;

With Dylan not expected to release any new material for an extended period of time, CBS Records president Clive Davis proposed issuing a double LP compilation of older material. Dylan agreed, compiling it himself and suggesting that the package include a full side of unreleased tracks from his archives. After submitting a set of excerpts from the The Basement Tapes that Davis found unsatisfactory, Dylan returned to the studio in September 1971 to recut several Basement songs, with Happy Traum providing backup. The final package included one previously uncollected single, \"Watching the River Flow\", an outtake from the same sessions, \"When I Paint My Masterpiece\"; one song from Dylan's April 12, 1963 Town Hall concert, \"Tomorrow Is a Long Time\", and three songs from the September sessions, \"I Shall Be Released\", \"You Ain't Goin' Nowhere\", and \"Down in the Flood\". The remaining tracks were drawn from existing releases. In 2003, this album was released along with Dylan's two other Greatest Hits compilations in one four-disc set, as Greatest Hits Volumes I\u2013III. As with the Beatles' 1962-1966 and The Basement Tapes, all the selections could fit on a single 80-minute CD, but were nevertheless released on two CDs to match the LP."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Boheme is the Grammy Award Winning (for Best World Music Album) second album of the French duo Deep Forest, released in 35 countries. It mainly sampled Eastern European gypsy songs (i.e. the Bohemians, hence the name of the album) with electronic music. Hit singles included \"Marta's Song\" (featuring M\u00E1rta Sebesty\u00E9n) and \"Freedom Cry\". The album became the duo's most successful one, selling over 4 million copies and receiving a number of Diamond, Platinum and Gold awards in 15 countries. The song \"Freedom Cry\" has later caused controversy when it was revealed that the singer, K\u00E1roly Rost\u00E1s (\"Hutty\u00E1n\"), never received any monetary compensation from the song, and neither did his family after he died in 1986. His singing was archived by Claude Flagel, which was later sampled by Deep Forest. Flagel allegedly paid Hutty\u00E1n 1500 forints for the recording. The case was later documented in a movie entitled Hutty\u00E1n, released in 1996. The Gypsy relatives did succeed to some extent to get money from Deep Forest."@en ;

This album was also the first release by Def Jam as an imprint under its new Rush Associated Labels subsidiary, which allowed founder Russell Simmons more control and more ownership over its material, as the masters for proper Def Jam releases at that time were primarily owned by Sony Music's Columbia Records. Business as Usual was not as acclaimed as their first two albums, but was not considered to be a failure either. One notable aspect here was the debut of future Hip Hop star Redman, who appears on the tracks \"Hardcore\" and \"Brothers on My Jock\". Three singles were released from the album, \"Gold Digger\", \"Rampage (Slow Down, Baby)\" featuring LL Cool J and \"Give the People\". In 1998, the album was selected as one of The Source's 100 Best Rap Albums. The album was certified Gold by the RIAA on May 7, 1991."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Celtic Woman: An Irish Journey is an album by the group Celtic Woman, released on October 3, 2011. This album was released exclusively in France. Performers in An Irish Journey are vocalists Chlo\u00EB Agnew, Lisa Kelly, Lisa Lambe, \u00D3rla Fallon, M\u00E9av N\u00ED Mhaolchatha, Hayley Westenra, Lynn Hilary, Alex Sharpe, and fiddler M\u00E1ir\u00E9ad Nesbitt. All songs were taken from previous releases, which makes this album one of only a few that feature all members (current and previous). The only new song is The Water is Wide, which is performed by Kelly, Agnew, Lambe, and Nesbitt. Another version of this song would later be released in Celtic Woman: Believe (the 2012 international release), performed by Kelly and Nesbitt only. Lisa Kelly gave an interview about the album, saying \"The songs are very specific to this album, and it definitely reflects the name of it. When you throw in songs, like 'This Isle Of Innisfree' and 'Galway Bay,' you give people a glimpse of where you come from, and how beautiful Ireland actually is. And then we've got the more modern Irish songs with 'You Raise Me Up' and 'The Voice,' and then you've got the reliable and the beautiful 'Danny Boy,' which I think people really expect to hear from you. So it was definitely in the heading of the album, called 'An Irish Journey.' I think this really does reflect what it is.\" David Downes also gave an interview about the album, saying \u201CWe\u2019ve recorded \u2018The Water Is Wide' with the fabulous bagad Lann-Bihou\u00E9, and it\u2019s an interesting collaboration because when I was 19 I toured with Alan Stivell, famous breton musician, and I worked with Dan Ar Braz, also kind of famous breton musician, and a lot of Celtic Woman musicians and our engineer, Andrew Boland, have worked in the past with the bagad Lann-Bihou\u00E9 and with many musicians over there. So it seemed like a very natural collaboration. We\u2019re kind of brothers-in-arms, I suppose, so we all really just thought this would be a great idea. The bagad is so fantastic, and the opportunity is great for us to get to work with them.\u201D"@en ;

dbr:Doo-Bop	rdf:type	schema:MusicAlbum ;
	dbo:abstract	"Doo-Bop was jazz musician Miles Davis' final studio album, which would have marked the beginning of his turn to hip-hop-oriented tracks, \"doo-bop\" being a portmanteau of producer Easy Mo Bee's short-lived, new jack swing-derived \"doo-hop\" and \"bebop\". Davis died on September 28, 1991, at which time only six pieces for the album had been completed. To finish it off, Easy Mo Bee was asked to take some of the unreleased trumpet performances (stemming from what Davis called the RubberBand Session), and build tracks that Miles 'would have loved' around the recordings. The album's posthumous tracks (as stated in the liner notes) are \"High Speed Chase\" and \"Fantasy\". A reprise of the song \"Mystery\" rounded out the album's nine-track length. The project stemmed from Davis sitting in his New York apartment in the summer with the windows open, listening to the sound of the streets. He wanted to record an album of music that captured these sounds. In early 1991, Davis called up his friend Russell Simmons and asked him to find some young producers who could help create this kind of music, leading to Davis' collaboration with Easy Mo Bee, his last, the result of which, Doo-Bop, was released by Warner Bros. Records on June 30, 1992, to mixed reviews. The album won the 1993 Grammy Award for Best R&B Instrumental Performance."@en ;

The album was produced by Laurie Latham who recorded the album in Germany, Belgium, London and Liverpool after an aborted attempt at recording the album without de Freitas and with producer Gil Norton. With Latham being an exacting producer and singer Ian McCulloch receiving star treatment and drinking heavily, the recording of the album was more difficult than the band had initially hoped. The album made more use of keyboards than their previous albums, which had been string heavy. Although Echo & the Bunnymen was successful in the United Kingdom and, to a lesser degree, the United States, it received mixed reviews from the music press following its release in July 1987. The album reached number four on the UK Albums Chart, number 51 on the United States Billboard 200, number 51 on the Canadian RPM100 Albums and number 22 on the Swedish Albums Chart. Since its release, the album has been certified silver by the British Phonographic Industry. The album includes the singles \"The Game\", \"Lips Like Sugar\" and \"Bedbugs and Ballyhoo\"."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Fear of a Black Planet is the third studio album by American hip hop group Public Enemy, released on April 10, 1990, by Def Jam Recordings and Columbia Records. It was produced by the group's production team The Bomb Squad, who sought to expand on the dense, sample-layered sound of Public Enemy's previous album, It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back (1988). Having fulfilled their initial creative ambitions with that album, Public Enemy pursued a different direction and aspired to create what lead MC Chuck D specified as \"a deep, complex album\". Their songwriting was partly inspired by the controversy with member Professor Griff and his dismissal from the group in 1989. Fear of a Black Planet features elaborate sound collages that incorporate varying rhythms, numerous samples, media sound bites, and eccentric music loops, and reflect the content's confrontational tone. Conceived during the golden age of hip hop, its assemblage of reconfigured and recontextualized aural sources preceded the sample clearance system that later emerged in the music industry. Fear of a Black Planet contains themes concerning organization and empowerment within the African-American community, while presenting criticism of social issues affecting African Americans at the time of the album's conception. Its criticism of institutional racism and White supremacy were inspired by Dr. Frances Cress Welsing's views on color. In the first week Fear of a Black Planet was released, it sold one million copies in the United States, where it charted at number 10 on the Billboard Top Pop Albums. Critics praised the record for its sonic quality, societal themes, and Chuck D's lyrics, naming it one of the best albums of 1990. It has since been viewed as one of hip hop's greatest and most important records, as well as being musically and culturally significant. In 2003, it was ranked number 300 on Rolling Stone's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time, and in 2005, the Library of Congress added it to the National Recording Registry."@en ;

It was the band's first album for the label and their first with new drummer Ruby Mars. After the end of their major-label contract with Interscope Records in 1999 and the departure of longtime drummer Atom the following year, the band spent much of 2000 in search of a new label and drummer. Singer/guitarist John Reis experimented with several other drummers, resulting in the formations of Hot Snakes and Sultans, but did not find a suitable replacement for Willard. When Rocket from the Crypt signed to Vagrant Records later that year they recruited Superchunk drummer Jon Wurster to act as their studio drummer, and he played on a majority of the album's tracks. Partway through the recording process, however, the band discovered local San Diego drummer and professional skateboarder Mario Rubalcaba, who joined as their new full-time drummer under the stage name \"Ruby Mars\" and played on the remainder of the album. The addition of Rubalcaba gave the band renewed energy, and Group Sounds was released in 2001 to positive reviews. Some touring followed in support of the album, but band members were drifting into other projects (most notably Reis in Hot Snakes and Sultans) and Rocket became less the focus. Their next album, 2002's Live from Camp X-Ray, would prove to be their last."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Here I Am is the third studio album by American recording artist Kelly Rowland, released through Universal Motown (Universal Music) on July 22, 2011. The album is Rowland's first release since parting ways with her long-time manager Matthew Knowles and record label Columbia Records. Here I Am is predominately a pop, R&B and dance album. It follows Rowland's assertion that \"no one puts her in a box\" with common themes around womanhood, sexual intimacy and love. Originally scheduled for release in 2010, the album was pushed back after the first round of singles were released to mixed reception, both with critics and commercially. \"Commander\" (2010) produced by and featuring David Guetta topped the US Hot Dance Club Songs chart and became a top-ten hit in the UK and some of Europe. Three other singles: \"Forever and a Day\", \"Rose Colored Glasses\" and \"Grown Woman\", all had limited commercial success and are subsequently included on selected editions of the album or excluded altogether. The international version of the album features seventeen songs including ones excluded from the US editions and some remixes. Here I Am features guest performances from Lil Wayne, Nelly, Rico Love, Lil Playy, The WAV.s and Big Sean, who features on the single \"Lay It on Me\". Production of the album was handled by the likes of Rodney Jerkins, Guetta, Jim Jonsin, Hit-Boy, RedOne and The Runners. Love wrote half of the songs on the album, while Rowland received writing credits for three of the songs. After re-recording the majority of the album, a new single featuring Lil Wayne titled \"Motivation\", preceded the album in the US. It was greeted with a positive reception from critics and topped the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart as well as peaking in the top-twenty of the Billboard Hot 100, becoming Rowland's second most successful single as a lead artist in the US. Here I Am was received well by critics, many of whom praised the strong productions and vocal performances but questioned some of the guests and a lack of the up-tempo dance sound Rowland had spoken of. Here I Am debuted at number one on the Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart and number three on the US Billboard 200 albums chart, selling 77,000 copies. To date, it is Rowland's highest debuting album in the US."@en ;

The album was originally produced entirely by Nottz, but other up-and-coming producers were included on the project as well, such as Jeff Wheeler, Jay Swift, and Black Milk. The reason other producers were included was because in December 2004, over half of the completed material was leaked in the mixtape, The Vitruvian Man, causing tension between Canibus and Nottz. In an interview with SOHH, Nottz revealed he would no longer be working with him, saying Canibus leaked the material, blaming it on his manager Louis Lombard III. The record, which was originally slated to be released on May 10, 2005, was pushed back so Canibus could work on new material for the album. Because Nottz had cut ties with him, Canibus had to reach out to other producers."@en ;

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Houdini_(album)>	rdf:type	schema:MusicAlbum ;
	dbo:abstract	"Houdini is the fifth album by American sludge metal band Melvins, released in 1993 on Atlantic Records. The album was the band's major label debut after releasing their previous albums on the independent label Boner Records. The album features a cover of the 1974 KISS song \"Goin' Blind\". The songs \"Hooch\" and \"Honey Bucket\" were released as singles with accompanying music videos. \"Night Goat\" is a partial re-recording of a song the band had released as a single in 1992. Kurt Cobain is given co-production credit alongside the Melvins on six tracks, for guitar on the song \"Sky Pup\", and percussion on the song \"Spread Eagle Beagle\". Speaking to Kerrang! in 2008, King Buzzo remembered: In 2005, the album was performed live in its entirety as part of the All Tomorrow's Parties-curated Don't Look Back series and at San Miguel Primavera Sound in 2007. Another live performance of the album was released as A Live History of Gluttony and Lust in 2006. Though the album's liner notes list Lorax as the band's bassist, she does not appear to have played on the album at all. Says Osborne:\"This album is mostly just me and Dale Crover. Either I played bass or he did on almost all of it regardless of what the credits say\u2026\" The song \"Hooch\" is rated as one of the best songs of the decade by Pitchfork Media in the book The Pitchfork 500: Our Guide to the Greatest Songs from Punk to the Present. The album's cover art features an illustration of a two-headed puppy by graphic designer Frank Kozik."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Killing Heidi is the third album by Australian rock band Killing Heidi, released by Columbia Records in Australia on 30 August 2004 (see 2004 in music). It was the band's first album without their producer Paul Kosky \u2014 who worked on their previous albums and has a more \"sophisticated and grittier\" feel to it with the lead singer, Ella Hooper, stating that releasing the album is \"just like a re-launch\". Killing Heidi debuted in the top ten on the Australian ARIA Albums Chart, making it their second top ten album and sales were similar to those of Killing Heidi's second album, Present (2002) \u2013 both were certified gold by ARIA for 35000 units shipped. Their third album gave Killing Heidi another top twenty single with \"I Am\", but its second single, \"Calm Down\" was not a major hit. The band's mandate for the album was to \"keep things simple\", with lead singer Hooper stating \"More than ever before, this record is about us just being ourselves.\" The album was produced in Los Angeles with English/Indian producer John Travis (Kid Rock, Sugar Ray). Hooper described him as \"a bloody brilliant guy to work with. John guided us well but also really listened to our ideas and encouraged our feedback. We were more of a part of this album than anything we have done before.\" Hooper also stated that her vocals had improved a lot since the previous album. \"I was having a really shitty time with my voice and because of the operation I couldn't get it where I wanted it on the last album [Present]. There's this one note in 'Way Home' which I could never dreamed of hitting a year ago.\" The album debuted on the Australian ARIA Albums Chart at number seven on 6 September 2004 and was certified gold by ARIA with shipments of 35,000 copies. The album fell down the charts from then on, spending nine weeks in the top fifty, only twice rising back up the chart."@en ;

The album is named after the Jamaican National Hero and Rastafari movement prophet Marcus Garvey. A dub version of it was released four months later as Garvey's Ghost. This was the first album by the group recorded for Island Records, whose founder Chris Blackwell had been instrumental in breaking Jamaican reggae artists Jimmy Cliff, Toots and the Maytals, and Bob Marley to an international audience. It was produced by Lawrence Lindo, better known by his handle taken from the assassin of Lee Harvey Oswald, Jack Ruby. Apparently, upon their first meeting, Lindo and vocalist Winston Rodney realized the opening track to this album, \"Marcus Garvey.\" The backing musicians, whom Lindo named The Black Disciples band, had been assembled from The Soul Syndicate and The Wailers. On July 27, 2010, this album was remastered and released by Universal's Hip-O Records reissue imprint in tandem with the dub version on one compact disc.

It was released in August 1994 and has gone double platinum in Canada, reaching #3 upon its release. It was also their first album to chart in the US, peaking at #175 on the Billboard 200. Unlike on their previous album, Gordon, Steven Page and Ed Robertson did not write together very much for MYSD. The well-known tracks from this album include \"Jane\", \"Alternative Girlfriend\", \"These Apples\", \"A\", and \"Life, in a Nutshell.\" As with each of their early albums, the band recorded one song, \"Intermittently\", completely naked. Tracks cut from the album include \"Break Your Heart\" and \"Trust Me\", both of which were later re-recorded for Born on a Pirate Ship; the former was re-worked and appeared on that album, while the latter was cut again, and appeared as a B-side on the Shoe Box EP. Of the recording session, Steven Page said \"We did most of [recording Maybe You Should Drive] in Burnaby, a cold and industrial wasteland, with a huge budget we really didn't need [...] All a huge budget does is put you further in debt. Imagine if they raised your VISA limit to $5,000 and then you had to give your card to a professional shopper-let's call him a producer in the case-and he said, 'OK, let's spend the whole thing.'\" Also according to Page, keyboardist/percussionist Andy Creeggan considered leaving the band during the rehearsals for this album, but was convinced to stay for its completion, and subsequent promotional tour. Creeggan did indeed depart the band and entered McGill University's music program. He has since recorded four albums with his brother Jim (who is also bassist for Barenaked Ladies) under the name The Brothers Creeggan."@en ;

Critics noted the album's hybrid of various styles including rock, hip hop, folk, psychedelia, and country, and ironic, witty lyrics. The decidedly anti-commercial attitude of Mellow Gold became an unexpected commercial success and went platinum. In an effort to get the album into stores such as Wal-Mart and Kmart, which do not stock albums with a \"parental advisory sticker\", a clean version of the album was released. Nonetheless, Wal-Mart carried the explicit version of the album, though the move is believed to have been an unintentional oversight. The album's second released track \"Beercan,\" only reached number 27 on the Billboard Modern Rock Tracks chart, but the success of \"Loser\" helped this album sell over 800,000 copies at the time.

The album follows a few years after his band, Doves, announced they were taking an \"indefinite hiatus.\" The word odludek is a Polish word, meaning \"pilgrim\" or \"loner.\" Goodwin wrote and played almost everything on Odludek himself, with only a handful of guest musicians, including Elbow frontman Guy Garvey and former Dungen member Fredrik Bjorling, and the album was recorded and co-produced with Dan Austin at a studio in the Forest of Dean across 18 months. Goodwin said, \"Initially I wanted to have loads of guests on it. Maybe I wasn't trusting my own instincts because I'd collaborated in a band for such a long time, but that idea soon went out the window. Very quickly I decided I wanted to get my Prince head on and play everything. I became very protective of it. There was no-one steering me. I made it myself and paid for it myself, and that was very free and liberating.\" Odludek spawned four promotional-only singles; second single \"Live Like a River\" was given a commercial release on 12\" vinyl, featuring exclusive remixes of the title track and album opener \"Terracotta Warrior\". A dub remix of \"Didsbury Girl\" was released as a vinyl single for Record Store Day 2015."@en ;

dbr:Old_Ramon	rdf:type	schema:MusicAlbum ;
	dbo:abstract	"Old Ramon is the final studio album by American indie rock band Red House Painters, released on April 10, 2001 on Sub Pop. Originally completed in 1998, band leader Mark Kozelek had to wait until 2001 to release the album. The band had previously been signed to Island/Supreme Records, but a series of major label mergers in the late '90s left the band without a label. This meant the album had to be shelved until three years later, when Kozelek managed to buy back the album from Island Records and Sub Pop signed the group. During the wait for the album's release, Old Ramon built up a reputation as one of the greatest \"lost\" albums of the modern era, and one of the saddest cases of a band being left in limbo during the major label mergers. Once it was finally released, reviews were generally very positive. Alternative Press gave the album a perfect 5 out 5 rating, praising its \"timeless beauty.\" Many regard Old Ramon as a more lighthearted, optimistic recording than previous Red House Painters releases. The first track, \"Wop-a-Din-Din\" is Mark's tribute to his cat, while \"Byrd Joel,\" \"Michigan\" and \"Kavita\" are love songs. Elsewhere, however, the languid, lengthy \"River\" and \"Void\", and the melancholic \"Smokey\", confirmed that Kozelek hadn't lost his touch for articulating regret and sadness. The album also retained Songs for a Blue Guitar's mix of introspective acoustic folk-rock and heavier electric rock."@en ;

Dibbs, Jermaine Dupri, Kay Gee, Vincent Herbert, Rodney Jerkins, Craig King, Darren Lighty, Darryl Simmons. The album featured several guest vocalists, including Missy Elliott, Timbaland, Treach, Slick Rick and Tank.

It was also listed as one of 33 hip hop/R&B albums in Rolling Stone's \"Essential Recordings of the '90s\". One in a Million debuted at twenty on the Billboard 200 chart, selling 40,500 copies in its opening week; twenty-two weeks later the album peaked at eighteen, being certified Gold by RIAA. Within a few months, the album proved Aaliyah's breakthrough and a major milestone in the careers of Missy Elliott and Timbaland. It was certified double Platinum on June 16, 1997. The album was also certified Gold by the Canadian recording industry for shipments of 50,000 copies. One in a Million has sold over three million copies in the United States and 8 million copies worldwide.

dbr:Ragged_Glory	rdf:type	schema:MusicAlbum ;
	dbo:abstract	"Ragged Glory is the nineteenth studio album by Canadian musician Neil Young, his sixth with Crazy Horse, released on September 9, 1990. It was voted album of the year in the annual Pazz & Jop critics' poll and in 2010 was selected by Rolling Stone as the 77th best album of the 1990s. The album revisits the hard-rock style previously explored on Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere and Zuma. The first two tracks are songs Young and Crazy Horse originally wrote and performed live in the 1970s with \"Country Home\" notably being performed on their 1976 tour. \"Farmer John\" is a cover of a 60s song, written and performed by R&B duo Don and Dewey and also performed by British Invasion group The Searchers as well as garage band The Premiers. Young revealed that the song \"Days that Used to Be\" is inspired by Bob Dylan's \"My Back Pages\". The album features many extended guitar jams, with two songs stretching out to more than ten minutes. The album was very well received by critics with Kurt Loder in Rolling Stone raving that it was \"a monument to the spirit of the garage - to the pursuit of passion over precision\" and calling it \"a great one\". The CD single culled from the album, \"Mansion on the Hill\", included the otherwise unreleased song \"Don't Spook the Horse\" (7:36). \"F*!#in' Up\" (pronounced \"Fuckin' Up\") is frequently covered by Pearl Jam live (see Category:Pearl Jam Official Bootlegs for recordings), and was performed by Bush in their headlining set at Woodstock 1999. Toronto-based band Constantines recorded a version of \"F*!#in' Up\" in Winnipeg, which surfaced as the b-side to their \"Our Age\" 7\" in November 2008. Scottish heavy metal band The Almighty recorded the song and included it as a B-side (with an uncensored title) to their \"Out of Season\" single in 1992. An outtake from the sessions for the album, \"Interstate,\" was released on the vinyl version of the 1996 album Broken Arrow and on the CD single for the track \"Big Time.\""@en ;

The album was recorded and released in the lead up to Phish's reunion concert on New Year's Eve 2002 at Madison Square Garden, which marked the end of the band's two-and-a-half year break. As with previous Phish albums, the songs originated in collaborative writing sessions between frontman Trey Anastasio and lyricist Tom Marshall (with two songs contributed by bass guitarist Mike Gordon). Round Room is unique, however, in that the final tracks were taken from the band's unedited rehearsal sessions at The Barn, Anastasio's studio in Vermont. Rolling Stone notes that this approach gives the album a \"decidedly live\" feeling, and \"breathes with an anxious, edge-of-the-seat intensity that's missing from their previous studio efforts.\" Though largely positive, the review criticizes Anastasio's singing and the \"Phishspeak\" quality of the lyrics. Phish appeared on TV twice before their official return to the stage on New Year's Eve 2002. \"46 Days\" was debuted live on the December 14, 2002, episode of Saturday Night Live, and \"All of These Dreams\" debuted five days later on the Late Show with David Letterman. About a week after the release of Round Room, Phish recorded an impromptu jam session in a studio in New York City, excerpts of which were later scheduled for release as The Victor Disc.

See All Her Faces collects many of those tracks, recorded from 1969 to 1971, placing seven of the British recordings on Side A, while Side B comprises tracks recorded both in the UK and the US. As a result, the album has no cohesive sound, but offers many different styles of music. The album boasts eight producers, including Springfield herself. It has been suggested that See All Her Faces is best appreciated track by track, rather than as a whole stylistic statement, as her album Dusty in Memphis is often praised to be. The See All Her Faces album was never released in the US, and as a consequence the majority of the tracks recorded in the UK would remain unavailable in the States until the release of the Rhino Entertainment compilations Dusty in London and Love Songs \u2013 some thirty years later. In 2002, Mercury Records/Universal Music UK released See All Her Faces in its entirety on CD for the first time, then also including three bonus tracks; two further recordings from the shelved Faithful album with Jeff Barry and also Springfield's interpretation of \"What Are You Doing the Rest of Your Life?\", written by Alan & Marilyn Bergman and Michel Legrand for the 1969 film The Happy Ending. Springfield recorded her version of the song during the See All Her Faces sessions in London in the summer of 1970, but it was left unheard in the Philips Records archives until 1994."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Stripped is the second studio and fourth overall album by American recording artist Christina Aguilera. It was released on October 25, 2002 by RCA Records. Looking to transition from the teen pop styles of her self-titled debut album (1999), Aguilera took creative control over her next album project, both musically and lyrically. She also changed her public image and established her new alter ego, \"Xtina\". Musically, its music incorporates pop and R&B with influences from many different genres, including soul, metal, rock, hip hop, gospel and Latin music. Lyrically, most of the songs from the album discuss the theme of self-respect, while a few other songs talk about sex and feminism. As executive producer, Aguilera enlisted many new collaborators for the album. Upon its release, Stripped received generally mixed reviews from music critics, most of them criticized its lack of musical focus, while some of them called it an album for grown-ups. However, the album received multiple Grammy Award nominations, including one win. Commercially, Stripped debuted at number two on the US Billboard 200 with first-week sales of 330,000 copies. Consequently, it was certified quadruple platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for shipping over four million copies in the region alone. The album also charted within the top five of charts in Canada, Europe, the Netherlands, Ireland, New Zealand and the United Kingdom. It was Aguilera's best-performing album in the United Kingdom, becoming the 29th and 40th best-selling album of the decade and millennium there respectively, with 1.9 million copies sold. As of 2015, Stripped has sold over 13 million copies worldwide Five singles were released from the album. The lead single, \"Dirrty\", was met with mixed reviews from critics due to its sound and criticism due to its sexual music video. The follow-up, \"Beautiful\", was praised by critics and garnered chart success worldwide. The third single, \"Fighter\", became Aguilera's third top-ten hit worldwide from Stripped. The two last singles from Stripped were \"Can't Hold Us Down\" and \"The Voice Within\", which performed moderately on charts. Aguilera performed several songs from Stripped live during a number of shows, notably during the 2002 MTV Europe Music Awards, the American Music Awards of 2003, and the 2003 MTV Video Music Awards. Two concert tours were held to promote the album, the Justified and Stripped Tour (2003) and The Stripped Tour (2003)."@en ;

The album's biggest competition in sales was with Zard's \"Zard Request Best: Beautiful Memory\", the last album after its lead vocalist Izumi Sakai's death in 2007. According to the members, the \"T\" stands for several things, such as \"Tohoshinki\", \"Title\", \"Third\" album, \"Top\" and \"Try\". It could also stand for \"Trick/Trust\" and the group's \"Teamwork\".A week before the album's release, the single \" Purple Line\" had debuted and reached #1 in Oricon weekly sales. The management played a different strategy to promote the album by splitting the members into teams which travelled separately to different cities in Japan for a week and appeared on radio shows and TV programs. The song \"Kiss \u3057\u305F\u307E\u307E\u3001\u3055\u3088\u306A\u3089\" was specially composed and written by members Micky Yoochun and Hero Jaejoong, included only in 2CD+2DVD version.

dbr:The_Big_Come_Up	rdf:type	schema:MusicAlbum ;
	dbo:abstract	"The Big Come Up is the debut album by the American rock duo The Black Keys, released in 2002 on Alive Records. The blues-rock duo includes singer and guitarist, Dan Auerbach, and drummer, Patrick Carney. The album was created in Akron, Ohio, also known as the Rubber City. As the two began to grow up, they realized that rubber companies, such as Goodyear, were a dying industry. They knew they were not guaranteed an automatic job by achieving a college degree, so the two dropped out of college to pursue their musical career. They began producing \"The Big Come Up\" in their basement. Carney and Auerbach recorded the album using two microphones bought off of Ebay in Carney's basement. They recorded their album on an 8-track tape recorder because there was no longer a need for a needle, it did not break or shatter, and it could be played in the car. The cheap equipment gave the album a grainy, lo-fi sound, almost as if it had been recorded in the 1960s. This made their album sound unprofessional, but in turn, gave them a sense of authenticity that was largely based on other popular rock artists, such as The White Stripes. The record contained thirteen songs. Eight of them were their own original tracks, and five were cover songs. These cover songs included covers of Muddy Waters, Junior Kimbrough, R.L. Burnside. They also released an EP that included covers of the blues song \"Leaving' Trunk\" and the Beatles' song \"She Said, She Said\". The song \"I'll Be Your Man\" was used as the theme song for the HBO series Hung. \"I'll Be Your Man\" also appeared on the FX series Rescue Me. Alive Records re-presses this album regularly, often several times a year on different coloured vinyl or with altered sleeve artwork. These are usually marketed as limited editions., Alive Records had released The Big Come Up on vinyl on at least 14 separate occasions, opening themselves up to criticism, particularly in regard to the marketing term \"limited edition\".\"240 Years Before Your Time\" becomes silent at about 1:39 into the track on the CD version. This silence lasts until 21:41. According to Nielsen Soundscan, the album only sold around 139,000 copies. The two did not make much money off of the album, so they had trouble paying for a tour. Therefore, they raised money by mowing lawns for their landlord. Although the album sold poorly, it gained a cult following and attracted critics. In 2005 music critic Chuck Klosterman singled out The Big Come Up as one of 21 \"high-quality albums\" from the previous three years. As the two blues-rock singers began to gain attention, they caught the eye of American Independent record label, Fat Possum Records. Fat Possum Records quietly released blues music that drew inspiration from the gritty country blues guitar rhythms and from artists like Junior Kimbrough, one of Carney and Auerbach's leading inspirations."@en ;

With sales of approx. 300,000 US copies, it was one of Elton's poorest-selling albums in the United States. The track, \"Elton's Song\", was banned from radio play in some countries due to its content,[citation needed] which included references to homosexuality. The album was produced by John, Clive Franks and for the first time, Chris Thomas, who would produce many more albums with John through most of the 1980s and '90s. Five of the songs (noted below) were recorded during the sessions for his previous album 21 at 33. All B-sides released around this time were also from those sessions."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"The Hazards of Love is the fifth album by the American indie rock band The Decemberists, released through Capitol Records and Rough Trade in 2009. The album was inspired by an Anne Briggs EP titled The Hazards of Love. According to the band, frontman Colin Meloy had set out to write a song with the album's title, which eventually developed into an entire album. Becky Stark (of Lavender Diamond), Shara Worden (of My Brightest Diamond), and Jim James (of My Morning Jacket) provide guest vocals throughout the album, while Robyn Hitchcock makes a cameo guitar appearance on \"An Interlude\". The Hazards of Love is a rock opera, with all songs contributing to a unified narrative, similar to the use of recurring stories on the band's previous album, The Crane Wife. The plot is a love story: a woman named Margaret (voiced by Stark) falls in love with a shape-shifting boreal forest dweller named William (voiced by Meloy). William's mother, the jealous Forest Queen (voiced by Worden), and the villainous Rake (also voiced by Meloy) bring conflict to the album's story arc."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"The Mix is a 1991 remix album by Kraftwerk. It featured re-recorded and in some cases re-arranged versions of a selection of songs which had originally appeared on the albums Autobahn through Electric Caf\u00E9. H\u00FCtter stated in interviews that he regarded The Mix as a type of live album, as it captured the results of the band's continual digital improvisations in their Kling Klang studio. The band had made a return to the stage in 1990, after a nine-year hiatus from touring, and since then the band's live setlist has used arrangements drawn from The Mix rather than the original recordings. Stated reasons from the group explaining the release include:[citation needed] The album met with a rather mixed reception on its release. Many were disappointed at the lack of new compositions and, moreover, the production values of the re-recorded tracks did not strike many listeners as particularly cutting edge, something which Kraftwerk had previously been renowned for. The Mix was created entirely digitally, albeit during a period when the technology had yet to reach its maturity, and thus featured a sound which many listeners tend to find somewhat \"sterile\" compared to the analogue electronics employed on most of Kraftwerk's previous recordings of these songs. The album sleeve was somewhat obtuse in the information it offered. Production is credited to Ralf H\u00FCtter,Florian Schneider, and Fritz Hilpert, the latter of whom had replaced percussionist and stage set designer Wolfgang Fl\u00FCr after Fl\u00FCr left the group in 1987. Karl Bartos also left the band in 1991 and was replaced by Fernando Abrantes. Bartos claimed in later interviews that much of his programming work was still featured on The Mix, uncredited. A newly remastered edition of the album was released by EMI Records, Mute Records, and Astralwerks Records on CD, digital download, and heavyweight vinyl in October/November 2009. Because of licensing restrictions imposed by Warner Music Group, this version has only been made available in the US and Canada as a part of The Catalogue box set."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"To Record Only Water for Ten Days is the third solo album by American musician John Frusciante, released in 2001 through Warner Music Group. Unlike his previous two solo albums, Niandra Lades and Usually Just a T-Shirt and Smile from the Streets You Hold, the record differs significantly in that Frusciante explores elements of electronica, synthpop and new wave. It was recorded subsequent to his heroin addiction. Following a month in rehab for his addiction and his rejoining the Red Hot Chili Peppers, Frusciante felt deeply connected to the spiritual plane and was inspired by the many visions he had of spirits; the ideology of recording water for ten days refers to ten separate periods of time in which an album is conceived. In an interview he explained that the title comes from a symbolic picture of his body being a tape recorder that records the water for ten days as a way to take his \"chemical makeup\" off, in order to make a possible representation of the feelings and places he wanted to represent through music. The lyrics express this theme and deal mostly with philosophical and spiritual matters as well as delving into his usual brand of psychedelia-tinged personalism. It reached #30 on Heatseekers. Vincent Gallo directed a video for every track on the record. \"Murderers\" is featured in the \"Invisible Boards\" segment of the skateboarding home video Yeah Right!. The Track \"Remain\" features on season 1 episode 18 of Fox Network's hit series 24. Frusciante's main influences for this album were 1980s synthpop, post-punk and electronica bands that did their own programming, including bands such as Depeche Mode and New Order."@en ;

Songs were penned by J\u00F6rgen Elofsson, Toby Gad, Yak Bondy, Sheppard Solomon, Jade Anderson and Greg Wells among others. Initially scheduled for a 2003 release, the album garnered a generally mixed reception from music critics upon its release and peaked at number 15 on the German Albums Chart. With a domestic sales total of 40,000 copies, it widely failed to satisfy the label's commercial exepectations, resulting into the termination of Schoppmann's contract with the record company only four months after its release.

Another music video was also produced for \"Second Sight,\" directed by Gabriel Judet-Weinshel, featuring video footage of Joseph lip-synching the song projected onto a billboard over Lafayette Street and Grand Street in the Lower East Side of Manhattan."@en ;

It was her last studio album for then joint record label A&M and Interscope Records, released on July 22, 2003 in the United States. Before Harrison began to work on what eventually would be her third studio album, she participated in prior engagements which would result in the blockbuster success of \"Lady Marmalade\", a collaboration for the Moulin Rouge soundtrack, and a supporting role in the box office hit film Chicago. Production on Moodring was primarily handled by an array of producers; Harrison enlisted the assistance of producers Ron Fair, Missy Elliott, Timbaland, Rockwilder, Damon Elliott, Jimmy Jam & Terry Lewis, and a handful of others. With this album, Harrison wrote \"99.9%\" of her own lyrics and co-produced many of the album's tracks. During the process of recording the album, Harrison funded her own studio time and used several songs she recorded two years ago from her archive of music. Moodring, in Harrison's words is an experimental, somewhat bi-polar album with contemporary R&B/pop-influenced fusing soul, techno, reggae, and hip-hop substance. Moodring debuted at number three on Billboard 200 album chart with first week sales of 113,000 copies. This marked Harrison's highest debut and first week sales yet. Upon its initial release, the album received generally positive reviews from music critics with AllMusic praising Harrison for coming up with her best and most varied set of songs yet. Two months after its release, the album earned a gold certification from the Recording Industry Association of America. To date, it has sold roughly 589,000 copies. Moodring spawned two singles, including \"My Love Is Like...Wo\" and \"Fallen\", the former became a Top 40 hit globally. In August 2005, after five years with Interscope Records, Harrison decided to leave the company and her management."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Some Friendly is the debut album by the British alternative rock band The Charlatans, released in 1990 (see 1990 in music). Recorded at The Windings near Wrexham, Wales in 1990, the sessions proved somewhat fraught - the band fell out with the owners of the studio; \"it was one of those studio bust-ups ... Rob and Martin were up to their old tricks, smashing stuff up and that\" said singer Tim Burgess later. However, lack of songs proved to be the major problem. Having been together for less than a year, the band hadn't had the opportunity to stockpile songs. The album suffered as a result, featuring a few tracks that \"had to go on there just to make up the numbers\" (Burgess again). The band also felt that some songs (especially \"White Shirt\" and \"Polar Bear\") were overproduced, with the bass being lost in the mix and that the whole album sounded rather 'thin'. Both \"The Only One I Know\" and \"Then\" provided the Charlatans with hit singles, peaking at #9 and #12 respectively in the pop charts. In the UK the record went straight in at #1 in the album charts."@en ;

The album features guest appearances from Nas, Wu-Tang Clan-members Raekwon and Ghostface Killah, A Tribe Called Quest member Q-Tip, and Mobb Deep-affiliate Big Noyd. Embedded with hyper-visual lyricism, dark soundscapes, gritty narratives, and hard beats, it marked Mobb Deep's transition from a relatively unknown rap duo to an influential and commercially successful one. Most of the left-over songs from the album became bonus tracks for Mobb Deep's The Infamous Mobb Deep album (2014). Upon its release, The Infamous achieved notable commercial success, debuting at number 15 on the US Billboard 200 and number 3 on the Top R&B/Hip Hop Albums charts. On June 26, 1995, the album was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). The album produced four singles; \"Shook Ones Pt. II\", \"Survival of the Fittest\", \"Temperature's Rising\", \"Give Up the Goods (Just Step)\", which all achieved varying degrees of chart success, with \"Shook Ones Pt. II\" being the most successful. The album's haunting style, defined by its evocative melodies, rugged beats, and lyrics dealing with crime and poverty in inner city neighborhoods reflected the dark side of New York's urban landscape in a manner that received special recognition and critical praise. Along with albums such as Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers), Illmatic and Ready to Die, The Infamous... is widely credited as a major contributor to the East Coast Renaissance. Furthermore, the album is credited with helping to redefine the sound of hardcore hip-hop, using its production style, which incorporated eerie piano loops, distorted synthesizers, eighth-note hi-hats, and sparse bass lines."@en ;

Additional music, including alternate and unused compositions, was released with the book The Music of the Lord of the Rings films in 2010. Shore composed the music in an emotional, operatic way, threading through the scores over 90 identified leitmotifs, which are categorized by the Middle-earth cultures to which they relate. Shore began his work on the music for The Fellowship of the Ring in late 2000 and recorded the first pieces of music (the Moria sequence) in spring of 2001. Additional music for the extended DVD version was recorded in March 2002. A similar pattern was followed for The Two Towers and The Return of the King, with the final sessions taking place in Watford on March 20, 2004. The music was performed primarily by the London Philharmonic Orchestra and the London Voices, with the New Zealand Symphony Orchestra contributing some of the early Moria music. A wide variety of instrumental and vocal soloists, including members of the films' cast, contributed to the scores as well. The scores for The Fellowship of the Ring and The Return of the King won Academy Awards in 2002 and 2004. The latter film also won an Oscar statuette for Best Song, as well as the Golden Globe Award for Best Original Score and Best Original Song. Shore's music for The Lord of the Rings has become the most successful composition of his career and one of the most popular motion picture scores in history."@en ;

dbr:Night_Ride_Home	rdf:type	schema:MusicAlbum ;
	dbo:abstract	"Night Ride Home is the fourteenth album by Canadian singer-songwriter Joni Mitchell, released in 1991. It was the last of four albums she recorded for Geffen Records. Songs on the album include \"Cherokee Louise\" about a childhood friend who suffered sexual abuse, \"The Windfall (Everything For Nothing)\" about a maid who tried to sue Mitchell, and the retrospective single release \"Come in from the Cold\" about childhood and middle age. The title song \"Night Ride Home\" (originally titled \"Fourth of July\" and first performed during promotion for her previous album in 1988) was inspired by a moonlit night in Hawaii. Though the album contained no charting singles, the track \"Come in From the Cold\" received airplay on AOR stations. This was Mitchell's first album not to be distributed by the WEA family of labels. She had been signed to WEA's Asylum and Reprise labels in the past, and Warner Bros. Records had been the distributor for Geffen Records from 1980-90. That year, Geffen was sold to MCA Music (now Universal Music Group), as a result, the album was distributed by Uni Distribution Corp. (the distribution arm of MCA Music), which also took over the rest of the Geffen catalogue. A home video release, Come In From The Cold, was released the same year and features promo videos for five tracks from the album along with an interview with Mitchell discussing the inspiration behind them. As of December 2007, the album has sold 238,000 copies in the US to date.[citation needed]"@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Panopticon is the third full-length album by Los Angeles, California based post-metal band Isis, released by Ipecac Recordings in 2004. The album's title is derived from philosopher Jeremy Bentham's panopticon prison ideal and philosopher/historian Michel Foucault's later allegorical appropriation of the concept. The liner notes also include quotes from technology writer Howard Rheingold and futurist Alex Steffen; as a concept album, Panopticon's focus is on the proliferation of surveillance technologies throughout modern society and the government's role in that spread. Critical response to Panopticon was generally very warm; as it followed 2002's critically acclaimed Oceanic, many reviewers were quick to hold the two in comparison. The consensus was that Panopticon represented a progression, of sorts. The album's sound continued Isis' departure from the strictures of sludge and metal \u2013 which had been the hallmarks of their earlier material \u2013 and continued along the trajectory of post-metal, achieved by heightened use of melody and clean vocals. On April 29, 2014 a deluxe version of Panopticon, remastered by Mika Jussila, was released by Ipecac Recordings. It contains extra music in the transitions to and from \"Wills Dissolve,\" adding 10 seconds to the overall running time of the album."@en ;

It is the first album by the second lineup of the band, featuring vocalist, songwriter and lead guitarist Andrew Stockdale, bassist and keyboardist Ian Peres, rhythm guitarist Aidan Nemeth and drummer Dave Atkins, formed in 2009 after original members Chris Ross and Myles Heskett left in August 2008. Upon its release, Cosmic Egg peaked at number three on the Australian ARIA Albums Chart, the same position as the band's first album. The album was the only studio release by the band to feature Atkins, who left the band in April 2010 during the Cosmic Egg promotional tour cycle. The album was recorded between April and May 2009 at Sound City Studios and Sunset Sound Studios in Los Angeles, California. The title of the album comes from a position in yoga described by frontman Stockdale as \"like the fetal pose\". The album's release was promoted throughout 2009 and 2010 by the New Moon Rising World Tour, beginning in September 2009 in Australia. The first song released from the album was the promotional digital download single \"Back Round\" on 2 June 2009; \"New Moon Rising\" was the first full single release from Cosmic Egg, on 25 August 2009."@en ;

ns58:_Selfish	rdf:type	schema:MusicAlbum ;
	dbo:abstract	"Code: Selfish is a 1992 LP (14th) by British rock band The Fall which entered the chart at number 21. It is characterised by its harsher sound, in relation to the previous year's Shift-Work, and is influenced by techno music. This was probably due to the addition of techno fan Dave Bush to the line-up. Despite this, the album also has some notably mellow moments with \"Time Enough At Last\" (named after an episode of The Twilight Zone) and \"Gentlemen's Agreement\" being at odds with the overall sound of the album. Largely recorded in a converted church in Glasgow, Code: Selfish features the group's only self-penned Top 40 single \"Free Range\". The album would prove to be their last for the Phonogram label as the group were dropped following the release of the Ed's Babe EP later in 1992. Simon Ford reports in his Fall biography Hip Priest that Phonogram had to compensate the band for the early termination of their five-album deal and that these funds were used to record what became The Infotainment Scan. The album was re-released by Voiceprint in 2002, under licence from Phonogram and also appeared in a 2-CD set coupled with an edition of Shift-Work on the same label in 2003. This edition added \"Ed's Babe\" and \"Free Ranger\" to the track listing. It was reissued again in expanded and re-mastered form by Universal in May 2007. According to keyboard player Dave Bush, the song \"Immortality\" was partly inspired by Milan Kundera's 1990 novel of the same name."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Pop 'til You Drop! is the third studio album by Swedish pop group A-Teens, released in 2002 exclusively for the U.S. market. Recorded between 2001 and 2002 in Stockholm, Sweden, Pop 'til You Drop! provide a more American-driven sound rather than just Europop. For the first time, the A-Teens participated on the writing of the tracks and the design of the album and image. It was released as an American only release on June 18, 2002, in the hype of the promotion of the first single, the Elvis Presley cover \"Can't Help Falling in Love\", which was part of the soundtrack of Disney's movie Lilo & Stitch. The album also consists of six songs later released on their third full-length studio album New Arrival, with \"Let Your Heart Do All the Talking\" having an early altered version with a slightly different ending on this album in contrast to the New Arrival version, the song \"This Year\" from the Kim Possible soundtrack, along with four new previously unreleased songs. Despite the fact that their third studio album New Arrival hasn't been released in the U.S., this compilation album is considered as the third studio album there. The album peaked at #45 on the Billboard charts after their first headlining tour in the United States. Soon after, the album was released in Mexico, Argentina and other countries in Asia and Latin-America. The album spawned one more hit single \"Floorfiller\". Both \"Floorfiller\" and \"Can't Help Falling in Love\" were released in Europe despite that the album was never released there (although many import copies were available). Some promo copies of the album that were released in the United States included the bonus track \"Have a Little Faith in Me\" but this track was never commercially released until 2003 when their third album New Arrival was released."@en ;

It was their last studio album before their 2005 reunion. The album features a more energetic, new wave sound than its three immediate predecessors, anticipating singer and songwriter Peter Hammill's late '70s solo work. For this album, bassist Nic Potter returned to the band, having left in 1970, and violinist Graham Smith (String Driven Thing), also joined the line-up, in place of the two members who had departed in the aftermath of their previous album, World Record: organist Hugh Banton and saxophonist/flautist David Jackson. This considerably modified the band's sound. Officially, the band's name was shortened to just \"Van der Graaf\" for this album and the live album Vital, that followed, but contemporaneous Charisma Records promotional materials used both the full and shortened name."@en ;

It was the first to include new drummer Pete Kircher, who had recently replaced John Coghlan, and also the first to credit keyboard player Andy Bown as a full member of the band; on the previous few releases he had merely been listed as a guest musician although he had long been an integral member in all but name. Its release came shortly before the band appeared at a concert at the National Exhibition Centre, Birmingham, in the presence of the Prince of Wales, and the resulting publicity probably helped to send it to an entry position of No. 1 in the album chart, making it their fourth and last No. 1 album. Nevertheless, it received a lukewarm reception from fans. \"Dear John\", the first single and the only track not written by any of the band, reached No. 10 in the UK, but \"She Don't Fool Me\" stalled at No. 36. 1982 was the 20th anniversary of band members Francis Rossi and Alan Lancaster first meeting each other, and the sum of the numbers 1+9+8+2 is 20 (shown as the Roman numerals 'XX' underneath the album title), hence the name of the album."@en ;

For such an independent release, the album was a moderate success, making its debut on the U.S. Billboard 200 at No. 47 and its components charts Digital and Independent albums at No. 19 and No. 3, respectively.

	dbo:abstract	"Anything Is Possible (Atlantic 82167) is the third album by Debbie Gibson, released on November 20, 1990, under the Atlantic Records label. By late 1990 she was 20 years old and the late-1980s teen pop wave was near its end. Hence the album was Gibson's first album to not reach the Top 10 on the Billboard 200 Albums chart, peaking at #41 in the United States and sold much less than her previous two albums, Out of the Blue and Electric Youth, which both had gone multi-platinum. The album was still a minor success for Gibson and eventually was certified Gold by the Recording Industry Association of America. In Japan, the album reached #5 on the charts, achieving Gold status, thus becoming her most successful album in Japan. The album was released in March 1991 in the UK, but there it stalled at #69."@en ;

The album is based upon Lee's and Chapnik Kahn's personal experiences with the South American healing medicine, Ayahuasca, known for its psychoactive properties that are reported to lead the consumer to a state of spiritual awakening. The idea behind the recording was to sonically document the inner journey experienced while partaking in the Ayahuasca ceremony. Lee himself describes the album as \"dynamic and joyful, meditative and tender, playful and experimental,\" and hopes that \"the music contains some small portion of the deep nourishment that I have experienced from the plant medicine.\" The album's cover art was painted by Lee's wife, Ione Skye 100% of the artist royalties collected from album sales will be donated to the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies and the Amazon Conservation Team."@en ;

Work continued into 2013, at which time she left her previous label Hollywood Records and subsequently joined RCA Records. Described by Cyrus as \"dirty south hip-hop\", Bangerz represents a musical departure from her earlier work, which she has grown to feel \"disconnected\" from. As executive producers, Cyrus and Mike Will Made It collaborated with hip hop producers including Cirkut, Pharrell Williams, and will.i.am to achieve Cyrus' desired new sound. Their efforts resulted in a primarily pop record, with lyrical themes that revolve largely around romance. It features guest vocals from several new partners, including pop singer Britney Spears and rappers French Montana, Future, Ludacris, and Nelly. Bangerz received generally positive reaction from contemporary music critics, who praised its overall production and originality, and complimented Cyrus' public persona evolution. The record debuted at number one on the U.S. Billboard 200 with first-week sales of 270,000 copies. In doing so, it became Cyrus' fifth non-consecutive number-one album, including earlier soundtracks in which she performed as her former titular character Hannah Montana. It was the third-highest opening week for a female artist in 2013, and was later certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) after moving one million units. The album received a Grammy Award nomination for Best Pop Vocal Album, giving Cyrus her first Grammy nomination. \"We Can't Stop\" was released as the lead single from Bangerz on June 3, 2013, and peaked at number two on the US Billboard Hot 100. The second single \"Wrecking Ball\" was released on August 25, 2013, and became Cyrus' first single to peak in the top position in the United States. Its accompanying music video held the record for the fastest video to reach 100 million views on Vevo being beaten by Adele's \"Hello\" music video in 2015, it also earned Cyrus the award for \"Video of The Year\" at the 2014 MTV Video Music Awards. \"Adore You\" was serviced as the third single from the record on December 17, 2013; it has peaked at number 21 on the Billboard Hot 100. A remix of the track produced by Cedric Gervais was released on March 3, 2014. Promotional efforts for Bangerz continued to associate Cyrus with an increasingly provocative image, an effort first begun with her third record, Can't Be Tamed (2010).

	dbo:abstract	"Coexist is the second studio album by English indie pop band the xx. After a break from touring for their 2009 debut album xx, the band members began to write songs individually before they recorded Coexist from November 2011 to May 2012. For the album, the xx drew on personal experiences for their songwriting, while their music was influenced by the electronic dance scene that occurred when they had been away on tour. The album was produced by the band's Jamie xx, who had pursued electronic dance on other projects and developed as a DJ prior to the album. Coexist features a minimalist musical style with spatial arrangements, loose song structure, little dynamism, and experimentation with tension. Its songs are characterised by sparse elements such as simple chord progression, keyboard ostinatos, and fading motifs, while Jamie xx's production incorporates both programmed beats and live percussion instruments. Coexist touches on themes of heartbreak, loneliness, and intimacy. The lyrics, written by guitarist Romy Madley Croft and bassist Oliver Sim, address a failing relationship and changes in a romance with inner monologues and simple metaphors. When Coexist was released on 5 September 2012 by Young Turks, it received generally positive reviews from critics and debuted at number one on the United Kingdom's Official Albums Chart, selling 58,266 copies in its first week there. It also charted in the top 10 in several other countries and was promoted with four singles, including \"Angels\" and \"Chained\".

	dbo:abstract	"Dance Again... the Hits is the first greatest hits album of American entertainer Jennifer Lopez. It was released on July 20, 2012, by Epic Records, to coincide with the launch of her first world tour, the Dance Again World Tour. Lopez previously conceived plans for a greatest hits album in 2009, but instead opted to use the material recorded for her seventh studio album, Love?, which was released by Island Records in May 2011 after her departure from Epic Records in 2010. As Lopez owed the label one last album to fulfill her contract, she began work on a new greatest hits album in November 2011. She later became unsure whether she wanted to go along with plans to release a greatest hits album or a new studio album, eventually deciding on the former. Dance Again... the Hits comprises eleven previously released tracks, and two new recordings: \"Dance Again\" and \"Goin' In\". A deluxe edition of the album was also released, featuring three additional previously released tracks, and a DVD featuring a selection of eleven music videos. The album received generally positive reviews from music critics, who praised it as a reflection of Lopez's success. Some critics expressed their disappointment in the absence of several successful singles, but deemed this as impressive, noting that this may have been due to the large volume of hit singles she has released over the years. Dance Again... The Hits was a moderate commercial success, peaking within the top ten in fourteen national charts, and the top twenty in ten national charts."@en ;

The album's title track was a #2 pop hit and a #1 R&B hit in the United States, and the album sold over 2.6 million copies worldwide briefly returning the group to their former prominence. The group released two additional singles from the album: the funky \"Whatever You Got, I Want\" and the group's last top twenty hit for Motown called \"I Am Love\". Although the Jacksons were back on the charts, the brothers still complained of their artistic direction, most notably Michael. Nonetheless, the album became another disco concept album for the group, and showcased lead singers Michael and Jermaine Jackson. This album also marks the first time that all the brothers sang in their natural voices on the same song, which was entitled \"It All Begins and Ends with Love.\" The order is Tito, Jackie, Michael, Marlon and Jermaine, who closes the song out. Around this time the Jacksons were performing in Las Vegas with the rest of the family leaving this album with low promotion. According to an interview with Don Cornelius on R&B TV show Soul Train, Michael said that his favourite songs were \"If I Don't Love You This Way\" and \"What You Don't Know\".

However, the band still shares vocals amongst all the other players, with a specialty of sister harmonies backed by twin fiddles. The recording also is the first time the band has involved guest musicians. The music performed by Bearfoot has strayed from traditional bluegrass, encompassing multiple other styles under the umbrella of americana. Although straying further from traditional bluegrass, this is their first album to include the bluegrass staple - the banjo, played by guest performer Alison Brown. The album debuted at the top of Billboard Magazine's Bluegrass chart.

	dbo:abstract	"Enamorada de Ti (English: In Love with You) is the second remix album by American Tejano singer Selena. It was released posthumously on 3 April 2012 through Capitol Latin and Q-Productions. Enamorada de Ti was produced by Sergio Lopes, Leslie Ahrens, Andres Castro, Moggie Canazio, Cesar Lemons and Chilean record producer Humberto Gatica. Gatica had the idea of modernizing songs recorded by Selena into today's popular music genres. Selena's family had already been working on a similar idea, but they set it aside in favor of Enamorada de Ti, which had gained the approval of Capitol Latin. The selection of artists to sing duets with Selena began in late summer 2011. Gatica and Selena's family chose American singer and actress Selena Gomez, Puerto Rican singer Don Omar, Samuel \"Samo\" Parra from the Mexican rock band Camila, Mexican singer Cristian Castro, Spanish DJ mixer Juan Magan, and the Carlos Santana band, while the remaining songs selected were remixed. Recording sessions began shortly after the selected artists had been chosen. Once Selena's family released confirmation of a duets album in January 2012, it quickly caught media attention. Gomez used her Twitter account to promote the album's release, a move that Gatica praised. Castro and Samo performed their respective duets from the album during the 2012 Latin Billboard Music Awards. The duet version of \"Amor Prohibido\" was released digitally on iTunes on 7 February 2012. It peaked at number eight on the US Billboard Latin Pop Airplay chart. Other songs on the album, including the title track (duet with Magan), \"Como la Flor\" (duet with Castro), \"Bidi Bidi Bom Bom\" (duet with Gomez), and \"Fotos y Recuerdos\" (duet with Omar), entered the Billboard Latin digital charts for the first time since their original release in the 1990s. Enamorada de Ti debuted and peaked at number one on the US Billboard Top Latin Albums and Latin Pop Albums charts. It remained at number one on the latter for two consecutive weeks. After debuting and peaking at number 135 on the Billboard 200 chart, the recording slipped off the chart and never returned, as sales declined. Enamorada de Ti peaked at number 56 on the Mexican Albums Chart. The album received a mixed response from music critics, many of whom preferred the original recordings. Carlos Quintana of About.com named Enamorada de Ti one of the \"Best Latin Music Albums of the Year, So Far\" and one of the \"Most Popular Albums of the Year\" in 2012."@en ;

The album (although recorded in Liverpool) is named after the artist's native Essex, England and includes the singles \"Falling\" (1993), \"Whispering Your Name\", \"Getting into Something\" and \"Ode to Boy II\". Essex was again a source of controversy for the singer. In order for the album to be released at all, her label (originally CBS/Columbia \u2013 as of 1988 a subsidiary label of Sony Music Entertainment) insisted that certain Essex tracks were to be re-recorded and re-produced, and that there be additional material remixed to create a more 'commercial' package.

The album was released in Canada on April 1, 2008 and in the UK on February 9, 2009 via Aporia Records. The album was released digitally in the US on August 19, 2008, and was released on CD on May 5, 2009 by Minneapolis-based indie record label Afternoon Records. Expatriate follows the band's critically acclaimed debut self-titled EP from 2006. The album was produced, recorded, and mixed by Chris Stringer in late 2007. \"Tightrope\" was the first single, released on 7\" vinyl in 2008 by Magnificent Sevens, and as a promo single in the UK in early February 2009. The Coast toured the US and Canada extensively after the album's initial release. In an interview, Ian Fosbery said: \"An expatriate is a person who is not from this country and we started to feel like because we're always on the road and we're not always around, we'd come home and it's a really weird feeling, like you feel out of place.\" Expatriate was released to generally positive reviews. Soundcheck magazine proclaimed the band \"has just penned a gem of an indie pop album that serves as a sparkling expedition into thick, layered pop music that is equal parts Tokyo Police Club simplicity and U2 crescendos,\" and hailed the band's \"dramatic interlacing of densely composed rock and charmingly earnest pop music.\""@en ;

Neal Avron handled production duties. Commenting on the record's lyrical themes, Wentz said the lyrics were about \"the anxiety and depression that goes along with looking at your own life.\" In support of their release the group headlined tours worldwide and played at various music festivals. For their Black Clouds and Underdogs tour the album was re-released as From Under the Cork Tree (Limited \"Black Clouds and Underdogs\" Edition), featuring new songs and remixes. The album was Fall Out Boy's breakthrough mainstream success. Spearheaded by the lead single \"Sugar, We're Goin Down\", the album debuted at No. 9 on the US Billboard 200 with 68,000 first week sales, a position it stayed at for two non-consecutive weeks, earning the band their first top ten album and becoming their longest charting and best-selling album. It logged fourteen weeks in the top twenty out of its seventy-eight chart weeks. The album as well as its singles won several awards and achieved Double Platinum status.

The album is Lewis' first under RCA Records after parent company Sony Music Entertainment closed J Records and relocated its artists. Glassheart was conceived in 2010 shortly after the completion of Lewis' first headline tour, The Labyrinth. Recording and production took place in Denver, Los Angeles and London; originally the album was due for release in November 2011 but was pushed back several times to accommodate new recording sessions and allow more creative time. On Glassheart, Lewis reunites with Ryan Tedder, record producer of her previous singles \"Bleeding Love\" and \"Happy\" and songwriter Andrea Martin who co-wrote \"Better in Time,\" in addition to a number of new collaborators such as British duo Naughty Boy and Emeli Sand\u00E9, Rodney \"Darkchild\" Jerkins and DJ Frank E. Producer Fraser T Smith executive produced the album after impressing Lewis with his work on Hurt: The EP (2011), a cover song extended play (EP) that Lewis released to bridge the gap between Echo (2009) and Glassheart. \"Collide\", a collaboration with house music DJ Avicii, was released on 2 September 2011. Originally a song by just Lewis, Avicii sued Sony Music claiming that the song plagiarised his own instrumental \"Penguin\". Through mutual agreement it was released as a collaboration, becoming a top-five hit in the UK and Lewis' first to top the US Billboard Hot Dance Club Songs chart. The Afrojack remix of \"Collide\" is the only version to feature on Glassheart. Subsequent singles \"Trouble\" featuring American rapper Childish Gambino and \"Lovebird\" were less successful, the former reaching top-ten in the UK and top-thirty in Ireland while the latter sold fewer than 600 copies in the UK and failed to chart anywhere in Europe. Glassheart received a mixed reception from critics who praised the vocals and experimental use of dubstep and electronic music but were less impressed with the album's many ballads. In the UK, the album was Lewis' first album not to reach number one, debuting at number three with 27,000 copies in its first week. Elsewhere the album became Lewis' third top-five album in Ireland, and upon its international release in November 2012, reached top-thirty in some of continental Europe. Following a 2013 release for Austria and Germany, Glassheart peaked at number five and six respectively outperforming previous album Echo. In April 2013, Lewis embarked on the Glassheart Tour, in support of the album, visiting Switzerland, Germany and the UK."@en ;

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Grimm_Tales_(album)>	rdf:type	schema:MusicAlbum ;
	dbo:abstract	"Grimm Tales is the ninth studio album by gothic musical duo Nox Arcana. Like several of their other albums, this music is also inspired by classic literature. In this case, the folktales of the Brothers Grimm. Instrumentation includes piano, violin, cello, acoustic guitar, glockenspiel, and various wind and percussive instruments, which serve to establish the intended theme. In keeping with the dark fairy tale theme, ominous narrations from a \"Witch Queen\" and the deep, resonant voice of her male counterpart are featured on several tracks, as well as the raspy voice of an aging Crone as she invokes a magical spell. Artist and composer Joseph Vargo also wrote an original fable for this cd. Expressed in poetic verse, it tells of a wicked Witch Queen who has cast a spell upon the land of Faerie, condemning its inhabitants to a never-ending darkness, and two children who fall asleep one night to awaken in the dark realm. The wayward children set out upon a quest to find a magical \"Crystal Key\" which is rumored to open a gateway between the \"Realm of Fable\" and their home. The release date for this album coincides with Walpurgis Night. Universal Studios' \"Halloween Horror Nights\" in Orlando, Florida based their 2008 haunted attraction design, \"Scary Tales: Once Upon A Nightmare\", on the realm of fable explored in Nox Arcana's Grimm Tales album."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"In Session is a blues album by Albert King with Stevie Ray Vaughan recorded live for television on December 6, 1983, at CHCH-TV studios in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada, and released as an album on August 17, 1999. The album was released on DVD on September 28, 2010. It has also been released on CD and SACD. It was the first of two collaborations captured for television. It was recorded for one of a series of live television sessions recording the performances of various artists. The show was called In Session. The album includes a few short segments of the banter by King and Vaughan between songs. Initially, King was not going to do the show as he did not know who Vaughan was. He did not realize that Vaughan was actually 'little Stevie', the 'skinny kid' that he let sit in when King played in Texas. King talks about this on one of the conversation tracks. When he realized who Vaughan was, he agreed to play. The album's material is mostly King's concert line up, with one Vaughan cut, \"Pride and Joy.\" King is 'driving' the session, but he purposefully features Vaughan on a number of the songs."@en ;
