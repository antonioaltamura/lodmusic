dbr:The_Disposable_Heroes_of_Hiphoprisy	rdf:type	dbo:Band ;
	dbo:abstract	"The Disposable Heroes of Hiphoprisy was an American industrial hip-hop band, active during the early 1990s. The band was formed in 1990 by Michael Franti (vocals, production, misc. instruments) and Rono Tse (drums, percussion, programming), who had been in the Beatnigs. The band's name was derived in part from the phrase \"The Disposable Heroes of Hypocrisy\", used in some Socialist literature.[citation needed] The group was associated with contemporary bands by genre, including House of Pain and Pop Will Eat Itself. They also were somewhat reminiscent of Gil Scott-Heron due to the half-spoken vocal styles of Franti and the up-front political messages in the music. The Disposable Heroes played many concerts, sometimes opening the bill for more well-known acts such as U2 (on their landmark Zoo TV Tour), Rage Against the Machine, Nirvana and Arrested Development. Guitarist Charlie Hunter made his recording debut with the Disposable Heroes before earning fame in jazz."@en ;

The album, which has twelve original tracks, received solid reviews and had in \"Reach the Rock\" a minor radio hit. Following Dixon's death on 3 April 1993 and departure of Simonon who moved on to a career of art, Myrick put out one more album with different line-up but it was also unsuccessful and the band broke up shortly after.

	dbo:abstract	"\"The Latino Rockabilly War\" was a band most notable for backing The Clash frontman Joe Strummer on one album. With Strummer, The Latino Rockabilly War created Earthquake Weather, through Epic Records. The album was well received by critics, but did not sell well and Joe Strummer lost his deal with Epic (excepting a hypothetical circumstance in which he decided to reform or re-create the Clash with the same or new musicians, in which case he would have been forced to work with Epic)[citation needed]. Led by Strummer, they also contributed five songs to the soundtrack for the movie Permanent Record, which featured a young Keanu Reeves: \"Trash City\", \"Baby the Trans\", \"Nothin' 'bout Nothin\", \"Nefertiti Rock\", and the instrumental \"Theme from Permanent Record\". In a segment of the documentary film Joe Strummer: The Future Is Unwritten, Anthony Kiedis mentions that during the period in which the bands' material was recorded, drummer Jack Irons (formerly of Red Hot Chili Peppers and Pearl Jam) was in residency at a mental institution. Therefore, Strummer had to arrange transportation and leave for Irons in order for him to participate in the bands' output. The band toured with Strummer on the Rock Against The Rich Tour in 1988 with friends in tow, including film director Alex Cox. Their sets included songs spanning Strummer's career to that point, including works from The 101ers and The Clash, additionally material co written with Mick Jones for Big Audio Dynamite's No. 10, Upping St. album as well as a cover of The Pogues' song \"If I Should Fall From Grace With God.\""@en ;

Korni Group) was a Serbian and Yugoslav rock band from Belgrade, also known as the Kornelyans, the name which they used during a short-lived foray into the international market. Formed in 1968, Korni Grupa was one of the first Yugoslav rock bands to achieve major mainstream popularity, and the first Yugoslav supergroup. Korni Grupa is considered to be one of the most prominent and influential bands in the history of rock music in Yugoslavia. Since the beginning of their career, the band had developed a two-way musical development, one of commercial pop rock music aimed for mainstream popularity, and the other, an artistically influenced progressive rock sound crossed with influences of psychedelic, folk, jazz and symphonic rock music. The band was led by keyboard player Kornelije Kova\u010D whom with the bassist Bojan Hreljac and drummer Vladimir Furduj and guitarist Velibor Kacl formed the band. After changing several vocalists, Miroslava Kojadinovi\u0107, Du\u0161an Prelevi\u0107 and Dalibor Brun, and releasing several singles, the band's vocalist became Dado Topi\u0107 who brought along his former bandmate Josip Bo\u010Dek as the replacement for Kacl. The lineup recorded an album's worth material, released posthumously as 1941., before Topi\u0107's departure. His substitute was Zdravko \u010Coli\u0107 who after a six-month period left the spot to Zlatko Pejakovi\u0107. With Pejakovi\u0107 the band recorded their eponymous debut album, the first full length rock album in SR Serbia and fourth in Yugoslavia and an English language second album Not an Ordinary Life, under the name Kornelyans. The band had also performed at the 1974 Eurovision Song Contest reaching the 12th place, owing to which, along with the little success of the second album, the band had decided to split. They held two farewell concerts at the Novi Sad Studio M and disbanded on December 1, 1974. A part of the recordings from the concerts was released on the posthumous compilation album Mrtvo more, the first double album in the history of Yugoslav rock music. After the band disbandment, the band members pursued careers as studio musicians, producers and solo acts and reunited in 1987 with Topi\u0107 on vocals for two performances, in Zagreb and Belgrade."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Deadboy & the Elephantmen was an American indie rock band from 2000 to 2007. Based in Houma, Louisiana, the band was fronted by Dax Riggs (formerly of Acid Bath and Agents of Oblivion). After disputes with an independent label over the distribution of their debut album If This Is Hell, Then I'm Lucky, the band signed a three-record deal with Fat Possum. For the latter part of 2005, and most of 2006, they toured in support of their major label debut, We Are Night Sky, playing from bars and smaller venues to Lollapalooza, Austin City Limits, and Bonnaroo. In early 2006, Riggs recruited his former Agents of Oblivion bandmate, Alex Bergeron, to play bass on tour. Later that year, the band was primarily a duo of Riggs and Tess Brunet. This line-up was often compared to The White Stripes in reviews, and their music is sometimes referred to as \"swamp rock.\" By 2007, Brunet left the band and Riggs went on to a solo career. In 2015, their track \"Stop, I`m Already Dead\" became the theme song for the television series iZombie, currently airing on The CW."@en ;

Composed of one DJ (Grandmaster Flash) and five rappers (Melle Mel, The Kidd Creole, Keith Cowboy, Mr. Ness/Scorpio, and Rahiem), the group's use of turntablism, break-beat deejaying, choreographed stage routines and lyricism was a significant force in the early development of hip-hop music. The group rose to fame in the early 1980s with their first successful funk single \"Freedom\" and later on with their magnum opus \"The Message\", which is often cited as among the most influential hip hop songs. However, in 1983, relations between Grandmaster Flash, Rahiem and The Kidd Creole became strained with SugarHill records, and half the group left to record on Elektra Records. A reunion was organized in 1987, and it released a new album. Afterward, the sextet disbanded permanently. The group was active for five years and released two studio albums. In 2007, it became the first hip hop group ever to be inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame."@en ;

Originally a quintet, they originated on the international television talent show Popstars and was one of the first television-cast acts to achieve continued success throughout Central Europe in the early 2000s. Following a major success with record-breaking single \"Daylight in Your Eyes\" and debut album Elle'ments in 2001, a series of hit records established their position as one of the most successful female band vocalists to emerge in the early decade. With four number-one hits, three number-one albums and record sales of more than 5.0 million. they became both the biggest-selling German girlband of all time and the most successful girlband of the 2000s in Continental Europe, winning three ECHOs, a World Music Awards, a NRJ Music Award, two Comets, a Bambi and a Goldene Kamera. In fall 2003, the members went their separate ways due to lasting exhaustion, focusing on their individual solo careers in music, theatre, television and film. In 2007, it was confirmed that four members of the original line-up had re-formed permanently and were set to record their first studio album in over four years, Destiny (2007). A year after, the group represented Germany at the Eurovision Song Contest 2008 in Belgrade, where they finished 23rd in the final voting. After another musical hiatus, the band released a second post-reunion studio album titled Welcome to the Dance in 2009 which failed commercially. In September 2010, Benaissa officially left the band due to private reasons, leaving No Angels as a trio.

Next came \"The Flood of Ixtlan\" EP, 30-minute amalgamation of different styles, from IDM to micronoise and freak-folk. A year later, a collection of studio outtakes, live cuts and other rarities, \"Les 120 Minuetes de Sadomasonodoraemonocuporamenosodom\" was also made available for download on RAIG affiliated net-label Accessory Takes. While this record included mostly song-oriented tracks in noise-rock vein, next studio album by Won James Won entitled \"Corpus Unhearmeticum\" operates in collage, musique concr\u00E8te and dark ambient aesthetics. Artwork for the strictly limited edition of this CD courtesy of ZonderZond is especially ambitious. In 2011 the band delved deeper into field recordings/plunderphonics territory with self-released \"Homeostat EP\". Sounds incorporated in this work were sampled in variety of abandoned factories and wild forests in rural Russia. Next EP was called \"\u0413\u0415\u041D\u0428\u0422\u0410\u0411 \u0414\u0415\u0421\u0411\u041E\u0422\" - a grim-sounding foray into dark ambient electronics. The latest full-length studio album by Won James Won, \"\u0412\u043E\u0438\u043D\u044F \u0412\u0435\u0437\u0443\u043C\u0438\u044F\" is decidedly melodical and song-structured but still as off-kilter as anything in the band's discography. Won James Won are members of ZveZdaZ art-movement. The band is considered as one of the most prolific on Russian underground scene. Their albums were distributed by such well-known underground labels as Cold Spring (U.K.), Amanita (France) and Crucial Blast (US)."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Electro Hippies was a crust punk band formed in St Helens/Wigan, United Kingdom, in 1985. Though they were short-lived and underground through their career, their music influenced many future crust, hardcore punk, and grindcore bands. The band relied heavily on low bass end sounds to create their low-fi, primitively produced music. They also incorporated elements of heavy metal and have been described as \"proto-grindcore\". The band strongly embraced the D.I.Y. (do it yourself) ethic which was very common among many early crust punk bands. The band's lyrics spoke heavily about animal rights and vegetarianism. A recurring lyrical theme on each LP targeted the McDonalds corporation, evidenced by the lyrics to \"Run Ronald\" and \"Scum\". The band were supported by John Peel for whom they recorded a radio session in 1987, released as an EP by Strange Fruit Records the same year. The Electro Hippies included Jeff Walker (guitar, vocals) in their ranks. He later joined extreme metal band Carcass. When Walker joined Carcass full-time, Simon (drums) and Andy (guitar) took over vocal duties . Eventually, the band split up in 1989, playing one last gig and releasing the show as their final album."@en ;

Lyrically, they also shifted hardcore into intensely personal realms and, in doing so, are often considered the first emo band, but Rites of Spring itself rejects any association between themselves and emo genres. The band only performed around 15 shows in the DC area. Vocalist/guitarist Guy Picciotto and drummer Brendan Canty went on to play in Fugazi in the late 1980s."@en ;

dbr:Pinhead_Gunpowder	rdf:type	dbo:Band ;
	dbo:abstract	"Pinhead Gunpowder is an American punk rock band that formed in East Bay, California, in 1990. The band has consisted of Aaron Cometbus (drums, lyrics), Bill Schneider (bass), Billie Joe Armstrong (guitar, vocals) and Jason White (guitar, vocals) for the majority of its existence. Sarah Kirsch (guitar, vocals), formerly known as Mike Kirsch, was the original guitarist, in place of White, but left the band citing personal differences with Green Day (the band for which Billie Joe Armstrong is most famous) and their major label debut album Dookie (1994). The band's name comes from a brand of \"high octane\" green tea served at the Arcata co-op and discovered by Aaron Cometbus during one of his many dumpster diving adventures. Cometbus, who releases the Cometbus fanzine, has played in many East Bay area bands such as Crimpshrine, Sweet Baby, The Thorns of Life and many more; Schneider is Green Day's former guitar tech and tour manager. Jason White plays additional guitar for Green Day; along with founding the seminal punk rock band Chino Horde. White has played in The Influents as well as The Big Cats. Sarah Kirsch has also been an active member in several East Bay bands such as Fuel, Torches to Rome, Bread and Circuits and many others. The vast majority of Pinhead Gunpowder's songs were written by Cometbus, although a few songs such as \"27\", \"Anniversary Song\" and \"New Blood\" were written by Billie Joe Armstrong under the pseudonym \"Wilhelm Fink\". Pinhead Gunpowder is a very elusive band. Over their 24+ year existence they have only released a few albums and only played 18 shows in total (that are known of). All of these shows have been on the west coast of the USA, mostly in the Bay Area. Their two lead singers are both members of Green Day and because of that the majority of their time is spent recording and touring for Green Day. Founder, drummer, and lyricist Aaron Cometbus is also busy writing his Cometbus zine, several novels, and in 2014 his first volume of poetry as well as producing artwork and playing in numerous bands. As a result of their busy lives Cometbus wrote that they knew upon forming Pinhead Gunpowder that it would have to be a part-time band that they could all come back to when they had free time."@en ;

The line-up consists of singers and guitarists Vincent and Daniel Cavanagh, their brother Jamie Cavanagh at bass, siblings John and Lee Douglas, respectively drummer and singer, and keyboardist Daniel Cardoso since November 2012. The band was founded as Pagan Angel in 1990 by the three Cavanagh brothers, John, and singer Darren White, as a death/doom band. At the time White was the only singer of the band. The following year, Jamie left and was replaced by Duncan Patterson. Under this line-up, Anathema released their first EP, The Crestfallen (1992), and their first album, Serenades (1993). However, White left in 1995; Vincent decided to act as Anathema's vocalist in addition to his guitarist function in the albums The Silent Enigma (1995) and Eternity (1996), which were going into a more gothic metal direction. In 1997, John left the band, and was replaced by Shaun Steels for the album Alternative 4 (1998). Both Patterson and Steels left the same year, replaced by Dave Pybus and a returning John Douglas, while former My Dying Bride keyboardist and violinist Martin Powell also joined the band (Daniel Cavanagh was also acting as the band's only keyboardist, and shared this position since). The only album released with this line-up was Judgement (1999): the same year Powell switched positions with Cradle of Filth's keyboardist Les Smith who joined Anathema, and Lee Douglas, John's sister, was added to the line-up as a backing and occasional lead vocalist. The band released their sixth album A Fine Day to Exit in 2001, turning to an alternative sound. Shortly after the release, Pybus announced his departure and was replaced by the band's original bassist, Jamie Cavanagh, reuniting the three brothers in the band for the first time since 1991. There were no new members for the next ten years, with the albums A Natural Disaster (2003) and We're Here Because We're Here (2010) all being recorded and released by the same line-up, with the sound turning even more towards progressive rock; however, Daniel Cavanagh left Anathema in 2002 to join Antimatter, returning in 2003. Smith left Anathema in 2011, and Vincent and Daniel both assumed the function of keyboardist for the band's ninth album, Weather Systems, in 2012. The same year, Cardoso, the band's live keyboardist since 2011, joined as a full-time member. The band's tenth studio album called Distant Satellites was released on 9 June 2014 via Kscope."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Finntroll is a folk metal band from Helsinki, Finland. They combine elements of black metal and folk metal. Finntroll's lyrics are mostly in Swedish, the only exception being the song \"Madon Laulu\" on Visor Om Slutet. Finntroll's original singer, Katla, decided to use Swedish over Finnish since he was part of a Swedish-speaking minority in Finland and the sound of the language seemed to better suit the band's \"trollish\" outfit. Despite several vocalist changes, this tradition has continued. According to bandmembers Vreth and Skrymer, they took their name from an old Finnish legend where Swedish priests coming to Finland had an encounter with a wild-looking man who killed most of their party. The survivors came back bearing the tale of the Finn-Troll. Finntroll's lyrics mainly deal with legends and tales revolving around the fictional Troll-King \"Rivfader\" and the trolls fighting against the Christians who entered their lands and spread their beliefs. A recurring theme is the story of two priests named \"Aamund\" and \"Kettil\". The first three full-length albums feature a rather short but fierce song about the two men who constantly get themselves into trouble with the trolls, only to get beaten up and mutilated over and over again by the wrathful followers of Rivfader. To date, the band's discography includes six full-length albums, a live album and two EPs. Their newest studio album Blodsvept was released on March 22, 2013. In 2014, the band released the live album Natten Med De Levande Finntroll (\"Night of the Living Finntroll\")."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Sherbet (aka Highway or The Sherbs) are one of the most prominent and successful Australian rock bands of the 1970s. The 'classic line-up' of Daryl Braithwaite on vocals, Tony Mitchell on bass guitar, Garth Porter on keyboards, Alan Sandow on drums, and Clive Shakespeare on guitar provided their teen-orientated pop style. In 1976 Shakespeare left and was soon replaced by Harvey James. Sherbet's biggest singles were \"Summer Love\" (1975) and \"Howzat\" (1976), both reaching number one in Australia. \"Howzat\" was also a top 5 hit in the United Kingdom. The band was less successful in the United States, where \"Howzat\" peaked at No. 61. As The Sherbs they also reached No. 61 in 1981 with \"I Have the Skill\". The group disbanded in 1984. Subsequent re-unions have occurred since 1998. According to rock music historian, Ian McFarlane, \"alongside Skyhooks, Sherbet was the most successful Australian pop band of the 1970s. With a run of 20 consecutive hit singles to its credit, and 17 albums that yielded ten platinum and 40 gold disc awards, Sherbet was the first domestic act to sell a million dollars' worth of records in Australia\". In 1990 Sherbet were inducted into the ARIA Hall of Fame alongside classical composer and pianist, Percy Grainger. On 15 January 2011 Harvey James died of lung cancer. On 15 February 2012 Clive Shakespeare died of prostate cancer."@en ;

The Hollies became one of the leading British groups of the 1960s (231 weeks on the UK singles charts during the 1960s; the 9th highest of any artist of the decade) and into the mid 1970s. It was formed by Allan Clarke and Graham Nash in late 1962 as a Merseybeat type music group in Manchester, although some of the band members came from towns north of there. Graham Nash left the group in 1968 to form the supergroup Crosby, Stills & Nash. They enjoyed considerable popularity in many countries (at least 60 singles or EPs and 26 albums charting somewhere in the world spanning over five decades), although they did not achieve major US chart success until 1966 with \"Bus Stop\". The Hollies had over 30 charting singles on the UK Singles Chart, and 22 on the Billboard Hot 100, with major hits on both sides of the Atlantic that included \"Just One Look\", \"Look Through Any Window\", \"Bus Stop\", \"I Can't Let Go\", \"On a Carousel\", \"Stop Stop Stop\", \"Carrie Anne\", \"Jennifer Eccles\", and later \"He Ain't Heavy, He's My Brother\", \"Long Cool Woman in a Black Dress\" and \"The Air That I Breathe\". They are one of the few British pop groups of the early 1960s, along with The Rolling Stones, that have never broken up and continue to record and perform. In recognition of their achievements, the Hollies were inducted to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2010."@en ;

The group started as a San Francisco Bay Area nightclub act with an original lineup of Dave Guard, Bob Shane, and Nick Reynolds. It rose to international popularity, fueled by unprecedented sales of 33\u2153 rpm long-playing record albums (LPs), and helped to alter the direction of popular music in the U.S. The Kingston Trio was one of the most prominent groups of the era's pop-folk boom that started in 1958 with the release of their first album and its hit recording of \"Tom Dooley\", which sold over three million copies as a single. The Trio released nineteen albums that made Billboard's Top 100, fourteen of which ranked in the top 10, and five of which hit the number 1 spot. Four of the group's LPs charted among the 10 top-selling albums for five weeks in November and December 1959, a record unmatched for more than 50 years, and the group still ranks after half a century in the all-time lists of many of Billboard's cumulative charts, including those for most weeks with a number 1 album, most total weeks charting an album, most number 1 albums, most consecutive number 1 albums, and most top ten albums. In 1961, the Trio was described as \"the most envied, the most imitated, and the most successful singing group, folk or otherwise, in all show business\" and \"the undisputed kings of the folksinging rage by every yardstick.\" Music historian Richie Unterberger characterized their impact as \"phenomenal popularity\", and the Kingston Trio's massive record sales in its early days made acoustic folk music commercially viable, paving the way for singer-songwriter, folk rock, and Americana artists who followed in their wake."@en ;

dbr:Breakfast_with_Amy	rdf:type	dbo:Band ;
	dbo:abstract	"Breakfast with Amy was an Alternative Christian rock band that formed in 1986 in La Habra, California at the La Habra Four-Square church. At that time, the band consisted of vocalist David Koval, bassist Jeff \"Tennessee Beans\" Beahn, guitarist Christopher Colbert, and drummer Paul Pellegrin. The pastor of the church was throwing a Saturday night concert. A band had backed out and he needed a replacement. David, Christopher, Paul and Jeff quickly formed \"Friends of Amy\" to perform. The band was later joined by Caryn Barker (married the guitarist Christopher Colbert about 1989, divorced about 1996) and Charlotte Stripland on bass. Charlotte was later permanently replaced in 1989 by Bob \"Edwin\" Wohler. Brothers Eric and Jeremy Wood filled in on Bass and Drums respectively in the final days of the band. The band initially released an independent demo tape in 1987. It featured 3 songs (Funeral, Ferris Wheel and Love Song) and was recorded at Half Moon Studio by engineer Dan Bush. For the demo, the line-up featured Rich Berger on Drums. In 1988 the band released a professionally recorded demo tape (see side B of the Narrowpath release). In 1989, Breakfast with Amy was approached by Greg Sostrom of Narrowpath Records and subsequently signed by him in 1990. This led to the formal release of their studio album Everything Was Beautiful and Nothing Hurt. The album was recorded at Casbah studios in Fullerton, California during two sessions about a year apart. The A side featured new material recorded at the time the band signed with Narrowpath Records of Concord, California. It was produced by the legendary Chaz Ramierez known for his work in the Orange County New Wave and Punk scenes. The B side featured their first studio tracks (previously sold at concerts). After limited release through Narrowpath, the band signed with Michael Knott's Blonde Vinyl Records in 1991. With a new label that could better represent the band's progressive music and image, Breakfast with Amy quickly moved to the forefront of the underground Christian rock scene that had been taking shape in Southern California since the early 80's. During the short lifespan of Blonde Vinyl, Breakfast with Amy released 2 studio albums. After the collapse of Blonde Vinyl Records (largely due to a poor distribution network, ill equipped to handle \"new\" music in the Gospel market) the band dissolved. In 1995, they released their final album (a live compilation), Live At The Hawleywould Bowl!, under Flying Tart Records. The band never truly found a mainstream audience in or out of Christian circles. In 1995, Gray Dot records re-released their first album with completely re-mastered tracks andfour bonus demo tracks (culled from their original demo). Today, Breakfast with Amy is remembered by fans of the fledgling alternative Christian rock scene as oneof the staples of Blonde Vinyl Records, being present on nearly all of their compilation CDs (as well as other alternative Christian rock compilations) and being one of only a few artists on the label to make a music video. For those lucky enough to have seen them live, the band may be best remembered for their outlandish stage shows. A typical performance featured costumes, Go go dancing, flaming taxidermy, and movie projectors used as stage lighting. Shows often ended with instrument destruction and a 5 minute wall of feedback. Due to these factors, the band was rarely invited back to a venue be it a club or a church. Stylistically, the band is best described as Post-punk, mixing elements of Psychedelic rock, Art rock, and Punk rock into an odd amalgam. Some of the songs have decidedly Pop music melodies, while others feature layer after layer of guitar dissonance and feedback. Musical influences include U2, Echo & the Bunnymen, Sonic Youth, The Who, The Ramones, The Sex Pistols and The New York Dolls."@en ;

Guitar One magazine listed her as one of the \"Fastest Shredders of All Time\". Her classical background, technical skills and self-promotion are sometimes compared to Yngwie Malmsteen. In an interview in metallian.com she claimed to be the reincarnation of Beethoven. Her public persona, as portrayed in her publicity photos and videos, is mainly compared to that of a dominatrix, albeit in an over-the-top, abusive tongue-in-cheek manner.[neutrality is disputed]"@en ;

dbr:The_Jackson_5	rdf:type	dbo:Band ;
	dbo:abstract	"The Jackson 5, or Jackson Five\u2014and The Jacksons in later years, is an American popular music group. Formed in 1964 under the name the Jackson Brothers, the founding members were Jackie, Tito and Jermaine. Marlon and Michael would later join. After participating in talent shows and the chitlin' circuit, they entered the professional music scene in 1967, signing with Steeltown Records, and releasing two singles. In 1969, they left Steeltown Records in order to sign with Motown. The Jackson 5 is one of the first groups of black American performers to attain a crossover following, preceded by the Supremes, the Four Tops and the Temptations. Scoring 17 top forty singles on the Hot 100, after continuing with further hits such as \"Never Can Say Goodbye\" and \"Dancing Machine\", most of the group with the exception of Jermaine, left Motown for Epic Records in 1975, where, with brother Randy taking Jermaine's place, they released five albums between 1976 and 1981, including the hit albums, Destiny (1978) and Triumph (1980) and the hit singles, \"Enjoy Yourself\", \"Shake Your Body (Down to the Ground)\" and \"Can You Feel It.\" In 1983, Jermaine reunited with the band to perform on Motown 25: Yesterday, Today, Forever and subsequently released the Victory album the following year. After the end of their tour to promote the album, Michael Jackson and Marlon Jackson promptly left the group. The remaining four released the poorly received 2300 Jackson Street album in 1989 before being dropped from their label. Inducted to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1997 and the Vocal Group Hall of Fame in 1999, the Jacksons reunited in 2001 on Michael's 30th anniversary television special. Following the death of Michael Jackson in 2009, the four eldest of the brothers embarked on their Unity Tour in 2012."@en ;

dbr:The_Greencards	rdf:type	dbo:Band ;
	dbo:abstract	"The Greencards are a progressive bluegrass band that formed in Austin, Texas, and are currently based in Nashville, Tennessee. The band was founded in 2003 in Texas by Eamon McLoughlin, an Englishman, and Australians Kym Warner and Carol Young. The musicians originally performed in local Austin bars, and soon found increasing acclaim. They have released one independent album, Movin' On, in 2003, and two albums, Weather and Water, and Viridian, on the Dualtone record label. Their fourth album, Fascination, was released on Sugar Hill in 2009. Their fifth album, \"Brick\", 2011, was self-produced with the direct support of their fans. Pre-production donors were recognized with their names inscribed on the \"bricks\" that make-up the cover art. Their debut album, Movin' On, was the recipient of local Texas awards and charted on Americana radio stations. Country Music Television named their follow-up Weather and Water as one of the ten best bluegrass albums of 2005, and The Greencards were invited to tour with Bob Dylan and Willie Nelson in the same year. Viridian would go on to take the number one position on the Billboard magazine's Bluegrass Music Chart, making The Greencards the first international band to ever do so. Viridian was a critically praised album, and was nominated for Best Country Album by the Australian Recording Industry Association. The track \"Mucky the Duck\" from Viridian was nominated for a Grammy Award at the 50th Grammy Awards. The Greencards are noted for their playing of American bluegrass with a worldly feel, and for their incorporation of other genres of music. Often labeled as part of, and said to be representative of, the \"newgrass\" movement, they draw from Irish folk music, gypsy music, rock 'n' roll, folk balladry, and Latin American musical sources. The Greencards' sound has been compared to progressive American folk rock, and they have been credited with helping to expand bluegrass music. Eamon McLoughlin left the band in December 2009, and currently resides in Nashville TN. Carl Miner, originally from Oregon, joined the group in May 2010, playing acoustic guitar. Carl won the 1999 National Flatpicking Championship at the Walnut Valley Festival, and currently resides in Nashville, TN."@en ;

dbr:Dave_Carter_and_Tracy_Grammer	rdf:type	dbo:Band ;
	dbo:abstract	"Dave Carter and Tracy Grammer were an American folk duo who released three albums from 1998 to 2001, as well as additional material released after Dave Carter's death. The duo consisted of Dave Carter (songwriter, vocals, banjo, guitar, organ) and Tracy Grammer, (producer, vocals, violin, mandolin, guitar). Their work dealt with a number of themes, particularly Buddhist theology, Arthurian legend (and mythic themes in general), and the American west, often juxtaposed together in one song. In 2002, shortly before his death, Dave spoke of the duo's \"ever-burgeoning goddess repertoire\" as another lyric theme. One example of her admixture of themes may be found in the closing lines of \"Happytown,\" the first track from the album, Tanglewood Tree: Their first album, When I Go, was actually released as a Dave Carter album \"with Tracy Grammer\" and Carter sang the lead vocals on all but one of the tracks, \"Kate and the Ghost of Lost Love,\" which was a duet. Produced by the duo, the album was recorded in Grammer's kitchen. Their second album, Tanglewood Tree, featured a more even split of singing duties, and was the first to actually be labeled as a Dave Carter and Tracy Grammer album. The album was described by Carter in an interview as \"the world's first Buddhist country album.\"[citation needed] Their third album (the last released before Carter's death), Drum Hat Buddha, maintained an even split between the two on lead vocals. This album met with considerable critical success, and the pair was considered by prominent reviewers to be one of the most promising new folk acts then active. In 2002, they toured the United States with folk legend Joan Baez, who described Carter's lyric writing as \"a kind of genius\" On July 19, 2002, Carter died of a massive heart attack while on tour in western Massachusetts. The impact on the folk music community was considerable; a substantial shrine was spontaneously created by fans and colleagues at the Falcon Ridge Folk Festival the following week. Grammer chose to attend the festival and perform without Carter; the festival organizers transformed the scheduled Dave and Tracy set into a tribute concert at which many of the performers at the festival sang Carter's songs, led by Grammer. Following Carter's death, Grammer went on to release a solo album, The Verdant Mile, the title track of which was her own tribute to Carter's memory and music. She followed this with Flower of Avalon, an album featuring nine previously unreleased songs by Carter. The album was produced by Grammer with John Jennings and featured harmonies by Mary Chapin Carpenter on many of the tracks - another testament to Carter's influence on folk music. In 2006, Grammer released another full-length Dave Carter and Tracy Grammer album, Seven Is the Number. The album consisted of a 2001\u20132002 re-recording by the duo of Carter's out-of-print solo project Snake Handlin' Man, with the addition of two previously unreleased songs, \"Seven Is the Number\" and \"Gas Station Girl\". 2007 saw the release of Grammer's latest album, Book of Sparrows, which contained two Dave Carter songs, as well as American Noel, a collection of holiday songs recorded by Dave Carter and Tracy Grammer, four of which were Carter originals. In February 2012, a new Carter and Grammer album, Little Blue Egg, was released by Red House Records. The material consists of eleven songs (ten of them Carter compositions) for which Carter had recorded vocals a decade or more earlier. Grammer found the tapes in their home and finished the songs herself."@en ;

dbr:The_Rezillos	rdf:type	dbo:Band ;
	dbo:abstract	"The Rezillos are a punk/new wave band formed in Edinburgh, Scotland, in 1976. Although emerging at the same time as other bands in the punk rock movement, the Rezillos did not share the nihilism or social commentary of their contemporaries, but instead took a more light-hearted approach to their songs, preferring to describe themselves at the time as \"a New Wave beat group\". Their songs are heavily influenced by 1950s rock and roll, 1960s English beat music and garage rock, early 1970s glam rock, and recurring lyrical themes of science fiction and B movies, influences that mirrored those of US bands the Cramps and the B-52s who were starting out at the same time. The Rezillos' biggest hit in their home country was the UK Top 20 single \"Top of the Pops\" in 1978, but they are best known outside the UK for their cover version of \"Somebody's Gonna Get Their Head Kicked In Tonight\", which featured on the soundtrack to Jackass: The Movie in 2002. Since the Rezillos recorded it, the song has been covered by other punk bands, including Youth Brigade and Murphy's Law. Released in July 1978, the Rezillos' first studio album Can't Stand the Rezillos is now considered a classic album of the first wave of British punk, but the group split up four months after its release, following internal arguments about their future direction. After the Rezillos split the band's guitarist and principal songwriter Jo Callis briefly joined a couple of unsuccessful Edinburgh post-punk groups, before being invited to join The Human League. He went on to co-write some of The Human League's best known songs during their most successful period, including their biggest worldwide hit, \"Don't You Want Me\". The Rezillos' vocalists Eugene Reynolds and Fay Fife formed the Revillos, a group with an ever-changing line-up that continued where the Rezillos left off. The Revillos split up in 1985, briefly reforming in 1994 for a tour of Japan, and again in 1996 for a UK tour. In 2001 the Rezillos reformed after being invited to play at Edinburgh's Hogmanay celebrations, and have continued to play live ever since, as well as releasing new singles occasionally."@en ;

As of 2011, the lineup consists of Patrick Stone (lead vocals), Michael Thomas (guitar), Lonnie Paul (guitar), Chip Z'nuff (bass) and Steven Adler (drums, percussion). Along with original material, the band perform covers of Adler's former band Guns N' Roses, primarily songs from the album Appetite for Destruction. Former Slash's Snakepit guitarist Keri Kelli first formed the band in 2003, with the original lineup consisting of Adler, Faster Pussycat guitarist Brent Muscat, former Ratt bassist Robbie Crane as well as then-Ratt singer Jizzy Pearl, also formerly of Love/Hate. The band toured the US and Europe, with a number of musicians filling in for band members due to other commitments. Following the departure of Muscat in 2004, they recorded and released the Adler's Appetite EP in January 2005. The same year, Adler announced a new lineup of the band, adding singer Sheldon Tarsha, Enuff Z'nuff bassist Chip Z'nuff, former Beautiful Creatures and Tuff guitarist Michael Thomas as well as Izzy Stradlin guitarist JT Longoria in place of Pearl, Crane and Kelli. Adler's Appetite toured before briefly going on hiatus in 2006. They returned in 2007, with Hollywood Roses singer Colby Veil replacing Tarsha, and Pretty Boy Floyd guitarist Kristy Majors replacing Longoria. The following year, Tarsha returned to the band, while Majors was replaced by former Quiet Riot and Beautiful Creatures guitarist Alex Grossi. Tarsha's return would be short-lived, once again departing the band with Ladyjack vocalist Rick Stitch joining in his place. With this lineup, they released new material, for the first time since 2005, releasing the singles \"Alive,\" \"Stardog\" and \"Fading\" in 2010. When Quiet Riot reformed the same year, Grossi departed Adler's Appetite in 2011, with Ladyjack guitarist Robo filling in for a European tour. However, following the tour, both Stitch and Robo departed the band, replaced by Aces 'N' Eights singer Patrick Stone as well as guitarist Lonnie Paul, former lead singer of Tilterworld and former Still Standing guitarist. The band dissolved once the tour was completed, with Adler and Paul forming new band \"Adler\"."@en ;

During their eleven years at Sony, 1993\u20132004, they notched up 11 Top 40 UK singles with three Top 10s, and had a chart presence worldwide.

They changed the writing of their name from Apollo 440 to Apollo Four Forty in 1996, though they switched back for their latest album. To date, Apollo's remixes number around 60 - from U2 in the early 1990s to Puff Daddy/Jimmy Page and Ennio Morricone a decade later. Apollo's mix of Puretone's \"Addicted to Bass\" was made a lead track and became a hit in 2002. Among their Stealth Sonic Orchestra remixes are a series of Manic Street Preachers singles."@en ;

Several backing musicians also performed with the trio; however, these backing musicians were not officially part of Blackhawk until 2008. Prior to the group's formation, Robbins and Stephenson had co-written several Number One singles for the country pop band Restless Heart, and Stephenson had also charted two pop hits in the early 1980s. Paul was previously a member of the Southern rock band Outlaws as well. In 1993, Blackhawk was signed to a record deal with Arista Nashville. Their debut single, \"Goodbye Says It All\", was released that year, peaking at No. 11 on the Billboard Hot Country Singles & Tracks (now Hot Country Songs) charts, and their first album (1994's BlackHawk) was certified 2\u00D7 Multi-Platinum by the RIAA. Throughout the rest of the 1990s, the band continued to chart several singles, in addition to releasing three more albums and a Greatest Hits package. Van Stephenson departed the group in 2000 due to complications from skin cancer. He was replaced with Randy Threet (also a former member of the Outlaws), who made his first appearance on Spirit Dancer, the band's fifth studio album. After Threet's departure in 2003, Anthony Crawford took over as tenor vocalist and lead guitarist; Crawford was, in turn, succeeded by Michael Randall four years later. From early 2008 until he re-joined in 2010, Robbins left the group to resume his songwriting career, and Threet re-joined. Since then, BlackHawk's backing band has been subsumed into the main group, which comprises Paul (lead vocals, guitar, mandolin), Randy Threet (bass guitar, background vocals), Chris Anderson (lead guitar, background vocals), Dave Robbins (keyboards, background vocals), and Monte Yoho (drums, percussion)."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Leb i sol (Macedonian: \u041B\u0435\u0431 \u0438 \u0441\u043E\u043B) is a Macedonian rock group founded in the 1970s by Vlatko Stefanovski (guitar), Bodan Arsovski (bass guitar), Nikola Kokan Dimu\u0161evski (keyboards) and Garabet Tavitjan (drums). Tavitjan ceded the drumwork to Dragoljub \u0110uri\u010Di\u0107 for some of the albums, while Kiril D\u017Eajkovski replaced Kokan on Kao Kakao and Putujemo. Beside being the most eminent Macedonian band, they were also one of the most important acts of the former Yugoslav Rock scene. \"Leb i sol\" is a traditional greeting which literally translates to \"bread and salt\". It is often used as an expression of spite or determination; e.g. \"I will eat bread and salt if I have to, but I will not give in!\", but that has nothing to do with the band's name. More commonly, distinguished visitors to villages and communities would be offered a piece of home-baked bread and a dip of salt as a traditional welcome, which is where the name of the band really came from. Their music combined elements of rock, jazz fusion and ethnic Macedonian music. As the band matured, the jazz influences became less obvious. However, in concert, Leb i sol performances of jazzed-up and lengthy versions of traditional ethno-folk classics such as \"Jovano Jovanke\" or \"Aber Dojde Donke\", were often received with great enthusiasm and cheer. Leb i sol were very popular in the 1970s and 1980s and, while not selling as many records as some pop and folk acts, were very well known and respected and often sold-out venues in most of the larger cities in the former Yugoslavia. The first two albums are often considered foundational, while most are diverse enough to be, at least in part, accessible to a fairly wide audience. The influence of ethnic music and folk music of Republic of Macedonia are recognizable in the use of odd meters (5/4, 7/8) and non-traditional scales (e.g. the Phrygian dominant scale). While all the musicians were fairly accomplished, Vlatko Stefanovski is frequently regarded as an exceptional guitar virtuoso."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"M2M was a Norwegian pop music duo comprising Marion Raven and Marit Larsen. Raven and Larsen had been friends since the age of five, and formed their first band when they were eight. They released a children's album under the name \"Marion & Mariot\", which was nominated for a Spellemannprisen award when they were 12. They later changed their name to M2M and were signed to Atlantic Records in 1998. M2M were frequently praised for writing most of their songs and performing their own instruments, something which was considered to set them aside from the majority of pop music artists. Their debut single, Don't Say You Love Me (1999), was both a critical and commercial success, and remained their biggest hit. Their debut album, Shades of Purple (2000), was critically acclaimed and sold over 1.5 million units worldwide. Despite critical acclaim, their second album, The Big Room (2002), did not perform as well commercially, and the duo broke up the year of its release, with each pursuing a solo career. A 'best of' album, The Day You Went Away: The Best of M2M (2003) was released after they disbanded. M2M sold over 2 million albums."@en ;

The band has a small but intensely loyal cult following. Band members are Brian Hageman, Mark Davies, Anne Eickelberg, Hugh Swarts and Jay Paget. Hageman was also a member of the Iowa City based group, Horny Genius. The band achieved their greatest critical and commercial success in the mid-nineties when they signed with the influential indie rock label Matador Records. It was during this time that Thinking Fellers produced their most prominent albums, Lovelyville, and the critically lauded college radio hit Strangers from the Universe. They toured the Netherlands, Germany, Switzerland and the U.K. in 1994 and made an appearance on the John Peel radio show on the BBC. In 1996 they toured briefly as an opening act for the then-popular band Live but were not received well by the Live fanbase. Thinking Fellers has been largely dormant since 1996, having toured sporadically and released only one full album, Bob Dinners and Larry Noodles Present Tubby Turdner's Celebrity Avalanche, since. In 2001, author Jonathan Franzen referenced the band in his widely acclaimed bestselling novel The Corrections. The character Brian, a snobbish fan of \"west coast underground bands,\" listens to the albums of Thinking Fellers while writing the music software that will make him a young millionaire.

Initially known as The Ingoes, they were renamed and signed to manager Giorgio Gomelsky's Marmalade label. The original line-up comprised Brian Godding (born 19 August 1945, Monmouth, South Wales) (guitar, vocals, keyboards), Jim Cregan (born James Cregan, 9 March 1946, Yeovil, Somerset) (guitar, vocals), Brian Belshaw (born 25 February 1944, Wigan, Lancashire) (bass, vocals), and Kevin Westlake (born Kevin Patrick Westlake, 5 March 1947, Dublin, Co Dublin, Ireland \u2014 30 September 2004) (drums). The band's debut album, We Are Ever So Clean is a classic example of quintessentially English psychedelia. On release, it was presented in the UK music magazine Melody Maker as \"Giorgio Gomelsky's Lonely Hearts Club Band\". Although not a major commercial success, tracks such as \"What On Earth\" or \"Look At Me, I'm You\" have helped give the album something of a cult period status as it is unearthed by successive generations of 1960s retro fans. It was included in Record Collector's list of the \"100 Greatest Psychedelic Records\". If Only For A Moment saw the band taking a noticeably heavier and rockier direction, with Cregan and Godding's distinctive two-part guitar harmonies playing a prominent role.[citation needed] At this point Westlake left, and was replaced by John \"Poli\" Palmer, and then Barry Reeves. The band quit in 1970. Belshaw and Godding rejoined Westlake in B.B. Blunder, Cregan formed Stud with John Wilson and Charlie McCracken, before joining Family, as did Palmer. The Blossom Toes contributed music to La Collectionneuse (1967), a film by French director \u00C9ric Rohmer and also appeared in \"Popdown\" (1967) by Fred Marshall.[citation needed]"@en ;

dbr:SinDizzy	rdf:type	dbo:Band ;
	dbo:abstract	"Sin Dizzy was a Christian metal band co-founded by former Stryper members Oz Fox and Tim Gaines. The band was founded in the mid-1990s after Stryper had disbanded. Its members included young drummer and lead guitarist . Bass player Gaines described their sound as \"a cross between [the] Stone Temple Pilots and Nirvana\". Sin Dizzy released their debut self-produced album, He's Not Dead, in 1998. The album sold well among the Christian metal fans, especially Stryper fans. However, it did not gather any mainstream success. The band played in several festivals in the United States. Notorious among these was a Summer Rock Festival in Puerto Rico, where former frontman of Stryper, Michael Sweet, joined Sin Dizzy on stage in front of 11,000 and performed several Stryper hit songs. Bassist Tim Gaines left the band in 2000 to continue working with his wife's musical career. Kevin Walt immediately replaced Tim as Sin Dizzy\u2019s next bass player. Plans for the recording of a future album were put on hold following the reunion of Stryper in 2003. It is currently unknown if Sin Dizzy will continue in the future or if it has ceased to exist. On November 28, 2008, Sin Dizzy re-released He's Not Dead (All Night Long) on Girder Records with all new artwork, liner notes and more, although the release was never authorized by Tim Gaines, who holds the rights to the Sin Dizzy Name. Guitarist Bobby MacNeil died in early 2013.[citation needed]"@en ;

They formed in 1995, with a line-up of Helmkamp, guitarist Gene Palubicki, and drummer John Longstreth, and recorded a demo, Goats to Azazael, which led to a contract with Osmose Productions. The band's debut album, Hammer of Gods, was released in 1996, after which rhythm guitarist Bill Taylor joined, playing on second album Exterminate (1998). Drummer Tony Laureano joined shortly after its release but Taylor left. The band's third album, The Inexorable, was released in the fall of 1999, after which Taylor rejoined. While on tour with Immortal, Satyricon, and Krisiun, in support of The Inexorable, the band had an accident in their tour van, in which Helmkamp was injured. On the same tour, Helmkamp's girlfriend was stabbed, and he decided to leave the band. The rest of the band continued for a while but decided to split up. In 2006, the band reformed and recorded a new album. Helmkamp said of the reunion: \"It just seems like the planets realigned. It's not like we didn't get along or that there were any bridges to mend.\" Their lyrical themes are generally concerned with warfare. The band has been involved in a number of American and European tours involving other metal acts such as Immortal, Krisiun, Cianide, and Watain. An East Coast USA tour was completed in May 2007 . In 2008 the band embarked on a larger European tour with Revenge and Arkhon Infaustus throughout Europe, this tour included a performance at the United Metal Maniacs Open Air Festival in Bitterfeld Germany. Upon returning to the US, live dates on the West Coast with Cemetery Urn, Sanguis Imperum, Gospel of the Horns, and Ares Kingdom were completed. On April 7, 2009, the members announced disbandment, citing \"musical differences\" as the reason. Helmkamp claimed that the band was fuelled by \"the constant struggle, strife, camaraderie, and unified will that forged the iron, blood, and blasphemy of our music and lyrics\"."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Beggars & Thieves is a band initially made up of lead vocalist Louie Merlino, guitarist Ron Mancuso, bassist Phil Soussan, and drummer Bobby Borg. Phil Soussan and Bobby Borg left after the band\u2019s first album and after some light touring, and they are pictured on the album sleeve/liner notes and credited as having played on it. They released a video for the song \"Beggars & Thieves\" from their first album. After that album, Beggars & Thieves went through some personnel changes. Soussan left to put together a band and write for long time friend Vince Neil's first solo project and Borg left the band. Mancuso, Merlino and producer Barbiero decided to carry on without them. In 1991, a new three-person lineup was formed\u2014one that consisted of Louie Merlino on lead vocals, Mancuso on both bass and guitar and newcomer Bobby Chouinard on drums. And it was also in 1991 that Beggars & Thieves left Atlantic and signed with Epic. With that new Merlino/Mancuso/Chouinard lineup plus a new keyboardist called Alan St. John and producer Jim Vallance, the band recorded its second album\u2014which probably would have come out in 1991 or 1992 were it did not for office politics. Unfortunately, Beggars & Thieves got caught in the corporate crossfire at Epic, which dropped the band without releasing that second album. Finding themselves without a record deal, Beggars & Thieves didn't record for any more major labels in the \u201890s. And when Nirvana, Pearl Jam and the grunge movement exploded commercially in 1992 and 1993, the majors lost interest in the type of pop-metal/hard rock that Beggars & Thieves specialized in. Instead of looking for the next Axl Rose (Guns N' Roses) or the next Vince Neil (M\u00F6tley Cr\u00FCe), major label A&R people were looking for the next Kurt Cobain (Nirvana) or the next Eddie Vedder (Pearl Jam). But despite the commercial decline of pop-metal and hair bands, Beggars & Thieves kept plugging away. In 1997, Beggars & Thieves' second album, Look What You Create\u2014the one that Epic decided not to release--, was finally released independently on MTM Music (although it had limited distribution). Two years later, in 1999, again on MTM Music and again working with producer Jim Vallance, the band could release their third CD called The Grey Album, where drummer Sammy Mangiamele replaced Bobby Chouinard, who could not finish his work on that album. Sadly, drummer Bobby Chouinard died on March 8, 1997. Beggars and Thieves is still performing in 2011, most notably at Vamp'd Las Vegas. Singer Louie Merlino sings for the Vegas-based band Sin City Sinners when their usual singer Todd Kerns is touring with Slash. In December 2011 the new hardrock magnum opus We Are The Brokenhearted finally saw the light of day with a worldwide release on Frontiers Records. The hardrock album produced by R. Bernard Mann and mixed by famed engineer/songwriter Kevin Churko (Ozzy Osbourne, Five Finger Deathpunch) received fantastic reviews all over the world. The first videoclip from the album for the single \"We Come Undone\" excited with a guest appearance by legendary rock guitarist Jake E Lee. The second videoclip for the song \"Innocence\" was first introduced by AOL / Noisecreep in June. R. Bernard Mann is currently producing Jake E Lee's comeback album with Red Dragon Cartel, which also features Ron Mancuso on Bass guitar."@en ;

After several years with no news of the project, e-mail correspondence between a fan and Chris Tentum (Weller) revealed that the group was in the process of producing new material, due for release some time in the near future. A year after this came to light, a new single from E Nomine appeared on Amazon.de entitled Heilig, due for release on December 28, 2007. The release date was pushed to mid-February 2008. Due to problems with their publisher, hard copies were never shipped, and the song was only made available for download. In the year 2012, the founder of E Nomine Weller and Graner started meanwhile their new project. Schlafes Bruder. It's a self-proclaimed revolution of E Nomine. It's a Hardrock Band which uses Latin chorus. The theme of their first album will be the crusades. The singer is Graner himself, who sang also Heilig and Excalibur, the last two known (but never officially released) E Nomine songs. Both songs are on the first 'Schlafes Bruder' album, released on 22.03.2013. E Nomine's Christian-themed song \"Vater Unser\" (Our Father) and album Das Testament were very popular among the German public."@en ;

The formation of Gomatt\u014D was announced in October 2002. The idea behind the trio was an R&B style dance-based group featuring Hello! Project soloists Maki Goto, Aya Matsuura and Miki Fujimoto, and was both conceived and named by producer Tsunku. Maki Goto functioned as the leader of the group. Gomatt\u014D made their first television appearance in November, and later released their first (and only) single called \"Shall We Love?\" on November 20, 2002. On December 11, 2002, Goto and Fujimoto performed with Yuko Nakazawa, a fellow member of Hello! Project, as a one-off performance. This incarnation of the group was called \"Gonatt\u014D\" (replacing the \"ma\" of \"Matsuura\" with the \"na\" of \"Nakazawa\"). All three members later recorded solo versions of the song, all with different arrangements. Miki Fujimoto's version was a more down-tempo soul inspired version, and both Maki Goto and Aya Matsuura's versions were\u2014like the original version\u2014inspired by the productions of Kevin \"She'kspere\" Briggs. The single was also featured on the 2008 compilation album \"Hello! Project Special Units Mega Best\". Goto and Matsuura would later work together with Natsumi Abe in the one-off unit Nochiura Natsumi, which later morphed into Def.Diva with the addition of v-u-den's Rika Ishikawa. Fujimoto joined Morning Musume (Goto's former group) and also became a supplementary member of Country Musume. In June 2006, it was announced that Fujimoto and Matsuura would form a new duo, GAM, and their first single was released in September of the same year (though they released only 3 singles before becoming inactive after March 2007). All three members graduated from Hello! Project in March 2009 with the rest of the Elder Club."@en ;

Their 1967 single \"Desdemona\", a Bolan composition, was banned by the BBC because of the controversial lyric, \"Lift up your skirt and fly\". Their US record label delayed the release their album, Orgasm for four years from its recording date due to objections from Daughters of the American Revolution. John's Children were active for less than two years and were not very successful commercially, having released only six singles and one album.

	dbo:abstract	"Lifter Puller, or LFTR PLLR, was an American indie rock band from the Twin Cities and the Boston area between 1994 and 2000. Their music is considered innovative, with its angular riffs and a synth-infused sound that predated the 80's revival fads of the early 2000s. Arguably, however, the band is most known[citation needed] for frontman Craig Finn's elaborate lyrics, which often relied upon an established universe of drug-addled coeds, cash-strapped nightclub proprietors, murdered ravers and other nostalgic excursions in Minneapolis and Boston. The band released three LPs and an EP before breaking up in the summer of 2000. In 2002, the compilation Soft Rock was released, featuring nearly every song in the Lifter Puller catalogue, excluding their final album, Fiestas and Fiascos, and the songs \"Prescription Sunglasses\", \"Emperor\", \"Slips Backwards,\" and \"Bitchy Christmas,\" as well as the original version of \"Nassau Colisseum,\" the b-side to the \"Slips Backwards\" single. After several years out of print, all of the original Lifter Puller records were re-issued digitally with bonus tracks in December 2009. These reissues were accompanied by a limited-edition book entitled Lifter Puller vs. The End of. Singer/guitarist Craig Finn and bassist Tad Kubler are now members of The Hold Steady, which continues to explore some of the lyrical themes established by Lifter Puller while eschewing the art punk sound[citation needed] of the prior band in favor of a sound more akin to classic-rock revivalism[citation needed]. In 2003, the band reunited for three sold out shows for the opening of the Triple Rock Social Club in their hometown of Minneapolis. They have a star on the Minneapolis nightclub First Avenue on the 7th street side. The band reunited on July 4, 2015 in Minneapolis, Minnesota at the Triple Rock Social Club at Dillinger Four's annual \"D4th of July\" event for an eight-song set."@en ;

The group was, and still is, as of 2015, led by singer-songwriter, producer, and multi-instrumentalist Fred Thomas (former member of His Name Is Alive). Through Thomas, the group's major songwriter, the group created intricate soundscapes which hearkened back to Detroit soul.[citation needed] The band was originally conceived as a basement recording project and did not play any live shows until 2002. The band built up a considerable following on the back of numerous limited-edition 7\" record and CD-R releases, resulting in the indie pop albums All Your Summer Songs, released in 2003 on Polyvinyl Records, and Every Night, released in 2004 on Polyvinyl. All Your Summer Songs was listed as one of the top 50 albums of 2003 by Pitchfork. Every Night introduced new singer Betty Marie Barnes, who became the nearest to a permanent female singer that the band ever had. By 2007, Barnes had semi-left the band and Thomas took over as the band's sole front person. SLGTM's music also changed and the resulting Fill Up The Room (2007, K Recs) album was more adventurous both lyrically and musically than the band's previous two albums (especially on the six minute 48 second pop odyssey of \"When I Lose My Eyes\").[citation needed] Following another European tour in 2008, Thomas retired the band to concentrate on other projects including City Center, and his record label, Life Like. The band reunited in 2012 with a changed line-up, and released \"Sunglasses\" on Polyvinyl Records. For Record Store Day 2012, All Your Summer Songs was re-issued on white vinyl in a special limited edition of 250. The band released One Kiss Ends It All in 2013, and continued touring into 2015."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"The Sch\u00FCrzenj\u00E4ger, formerly Zillertaler Sch\u00FCrzenj\u00E4ger, are one of the most successful bands of Austria. \"Sch\u00FCrzenj\u00E4ger\" is a German term for \"Heartbreaker\", which was first used in the early 1900s. (Literally translated, a Sch\u00FCrzenj\u00E4ger is a \"skirt hunter\": Sch\u00FCrze = skirt, J\u00E4ger = hunter) The band was founded in 1973; according to the band history, they were named \"Sch\u00FCrzenj\u00E4ger\" by a female bartender in Austria during a concert, when they didn't have a band name. While they started out playing traditional music with modern instruments, their style developed over the years to incorporate folk music, Pop music, and Rock music. One of their first big hits was the \"Zillertaler Hochzeitsmarsch\", a modern interpretation of a traditional folk dance melody. From then on they began to introduce more rock elements, inspired by their new (1990) drummer Patrick Cox. After \"Zillertal Hochzeitsblues (1990)\" they moved to the wider German audience under Montana (Later BMG Ariola) in 1991. With their commercial success, the \"Sch\u00FCrzenj\u00E4ger\" became the epitome for filling the gap between rock and \"Volksmusik\" in Austria, establishing the genre of \"Alpen Rock\" (Alpine Rock). The folk music community, however, saw the success of the \"Zillertaler Hochzeitsmarsch\" not as a success but as an abuse of traditional music. The Sch\u00FCrzenj\u00E4ger regularly ended their tours with the biggest open-air concerts in Austria. Since 1988 these concerts, called \"Alpen Air\" (a pun of \"Alpen\" and \"Open Air\"), were played every other year. From March to July 2007, the Sch\u00FCrzenj\u00E4ger went on tour for the last album \"Lust auf mehr\". This was the final tour with the lineup around band leader Steinlechner, culminating in the traditional \"Alpen Air\" in Finkenberg, Zillertal on Saturday 21 July 2007. The Eberharters then founded their own band, the \"Hey Mann! Band\" (HM!B), which performed Sch\u00FCrzenj\u00E4ger songs live, an album was also recorded. On 3 May 2011 the comeback and a new album of the Sch\u00FCrzenj\u00E4ger was announced for September 2011, before that an open-air concert will stage on 6 August in Finkenberg. The band consists of the Hey Mann! Band members Stevy (Stefan Wilhelm, vocals), Johannes Hintersteiner, Andreas Marberger, Georg Daviotis and the Eberharters, the last being the only members of the old Sch\u00FCrzenj\u00E4ger lineup. According to the band, former band leader Steinlechner doesn't want to get back on stage, save for a few guest appearances now and then. Cox and von Haniel are already busy with other projects."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Slough Feg (also known as The Lord Weird Slough Feg) is a heavy metal band that formed in Pennsylvania in the early 1990s and is currently based in the San Francisco Bay Area. Taking their name from the Celtic folklore-influenced comic book Sl\u00E1ine, the band released their self-titled debut album in 1996. The band combines influences from traditional heavy metal bands such as Iron Maiden, Brocas Helm and Thin Lizzy, and English folk metal band Skyclad.[citation needed] Slough Feg's 2003 album Traveller was a concept album based on GDW's role playing game of the same name. With the release of Atavism in 2005, the band officially shortened its name to Slough Feg. Guitarist Mike Scalzi maintains that the band always referred to itself this way internally, and the addition of \"The Lord Weird\" made it too difficult to find Slough Feg albums in stores (which alphabetized the CDs in inconsistent ways). Slough Feg is currently signed to Metal Blade Records and most recently released Digital Resistance on February 18th, 2014."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Spy vs Spy, also known as v. Spy v. Spy, The Drug Grannies and The Spies, are an Australian ska/pub rock band from Sydney formed in 1981. They became known for tackling political issues through their music, including racism, homelessness and contemporary drug culture. They were named after a comic strip, \"Spy vs. Spy\" in the US Mad magazine. The band's initial line-up was the trio of Craig Bloxom on bass guitar/lead vocals, Cliff Grigg on drums/percussion and Mike Weiley on lead guitar/vocals. Spy vs Spy's early music was ska-influenced indie rock, exemplified by their debut single \"Do What You Say\" on the independent Green label in April 1982. They released an EP Four Fresh Lemons in August. Their music became more straight forward hard rock for their pub audiences. The band broke up in early 1983 only to reform mid-year, by which time they were using the name v. Spy v. Spy to avoid legal problems with Mad magazine. They were eventually signed to Midnight Oil's label Powderworks and managed by Oils manager, Gary Morris. Their first full-length album Harry's Reasons was released in March 1986 and produced by Leszek Karski. They switched labels to WEA and had their highest charting success in February 1987 with their single \"Don't Tear It Down\" on the Australian singles chart and the associated album A.O. Mod. TV. Vers. peaked at No. 12 on the Australian albums chart. Spy vs Spy's follow-up album, Xenophobia was released in March 1988 peaked at No. 15 in Australia. It was produced by Karski and Guy Gray and released by WEA in 14 countries. Their 1989 album Trash the Planet peaked at No. 22 on the ARIA Charts. None of their subsequent releases reached the Australian Top 40. The band split and reformed a number of times but still developed a strong following in Brazil."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"The Dead Science (formerly The Sweet Science) is an experimental pop band based in Seattle, Washington. The band consists of guitarist/vocalist Sam Mickens, Jherek Bischoff on bass and Nick Tamburro on drums. Jherek Bischoff's brother Korum was the drummer from the band's inception in 1999 through 2005. Tamburro, who'd shared drumming duties with him on the recording of Frost Giant and had previously acted as The Dead Science's touring drummer, joined permanently upon his departure. Korum is still credited on the band's label page with \"guidance, stability and sometimes drums.\" Their music is heavily influenced by their training as jazz musicians and involvement in the avant-garde music of a number of artists, most notably Xiu Xiu and Degenerate Art Ensemble. Mickens has also cited Prince as an influence on his vocal style, often noted in reviews of the bands' work for its use of falsetto. The trio self-released their limited run debut EP Galactose under their original moniker, The Sweet Science, before giving up the name due to a cease-and-desist order from another band. Following the name change, The Dead Science released their debut album Submariner on Absolutely Kosher Records in 2003. This was followed by the release of their second EP Bird Bones in the Bughouse in 2004, their second album Frost Giant in 2005, and a third EP Crepuscule with The Dead Science in 2006. They were also named winner in the 'Jazz/Experimental' category in Seattle Weekly's 2006 Music Awards. In 2008, the band signed to Constellation Records, with whom they released their third album, Villainaire."@en ;

Started in 1995 by Gary Olson, Edward Powers and Javier Villegas, the band quickly released Marlborough Farms on Park N' Ride records, adding and subtracting a couple of members and going on an international tour. With Jeff Baron (Guppyboy, The Essex Green) and Jennifer Baron (Saturnine) added to the lineup, they released Beverley Atonale in 1997, this time on Merge Records. Powers left the band, and the remaining members, with San Fadyl and Sasha Bell of The Essex Green and solo act Finishing School, embarked on a United States tour. With a more stable lineup, the band released The Albemarle Sound in 1999, as well as added violinist and bassist Julia Rydholm (The Four Corners, The Essex Green, Jens Lekman) to the lineup. In 2001, Argyle Heir was released. In 2003 the band recorded a self-titled album at WaveLab Studio with engineer Craig Schumacher in Tucson, Arizona. In 2006 the band contributed heavily to the recording of Kevin Ayers' album The Unfairground which Gary Olson produced. In April 2006, Fadyl began fighting serious asthma attacks. On the 26th of April 2007, he died due to one such attack. The band released their sixth album, \"Can't Wait Another Day\", on June 5, 2007.

After the breakup, Svenonius, Canty, and Gamboa went on to form the short-lived Cupid Car Club and The Make-Up. Tim Green went on to help create The Fucking Champs, a mostly-instrumental progressive hard rock/math metal trio with indie pop appeal out of San Francisco, and later Concentrick, a solo project with a focus on ambient music. Nation of Ulysses was known for their tongue-in-cheek, far-left political concepts, their extremely physical live performances, and their unique take on punk culture and fashion.

dbr:The_Subdudes	rdf:type	dbo:Band ;
	dbo:abstract	"The Subdudes (stylized[clarification needed] as The subdudes) are an American roots rock group from New Orleans. Their music is a blending of American folk, swamp pop, New Orleans rhythm and blues, Louisiana blues, country, cajun/zydeco, funk, soul and gospel with harmonic vocals. Their sound is notable for the band's substitution of a tambourine player for a drummer. The subdudes formed in 1987 through a music venue in New Orleans called Tipitinas. The Subdudes often credit their songwriting to the group as a whole, although the primary songwriters are Tommy Malone (brother of The Radiators guitarist Dave Malone) and John Magnie. Current members of the band are Malone, vocals, acoustic, electric and slide guitars; Magnie, vocals, accordion, keyboards; Steve Amed\u00E9e, tambourine, drums, other percussions, and vocals; Tim Cook, percussion, bass and vocals; and Jimmy Messa, bass and guitar. They are an Americana band with a rock-based sound that also shows soul, gospel, blues, cajun/zydeco, country, and other American roots music influences. Their former bass player was Johnny Ray Allen, who had not been with the band since the band's 1996 farewell tour (documented the next year on the Live at Last CD) until a brief reunion in 2014. Willie Williams also contributed to three albums: Annunciation, Primitive Streak and Live at Last as a second guitarist. After regrouping in 2002 (first as The Dudes but then re-adopting the name 'subdudes' in March 2003), Bob Dylan's guitarist Freddy Koella helped produce Miracle Mule. The album Behind the Levee (2006) was produced by bluesman Keb' Mo' and yielded a minor hit, \"Papa Dukie and the Mud People\" (better known by its refrain, \"Love is a Beautiful Thing\"). Released in late 2007, the album Street Symphony was recorded in Nashville, Tennessee at Blackbird Studios during March 2007 and was produced by George Massenberg, who has worked with Little Feat. Released in late 2008, Live at the Ram's Head is available on CD or as a two DVD set, with one disc being the live show from \"The Ram's Head\" in Annapolis, Maryland, and the second DVD being Unplugged at Pleasant Plains, with interviews and live studio footage from the recording of Street Symphony in Nashville. Most recently (2009), the band's self-produced Flower Petals was recorded in Magnie's basement studio then mixed in Miami, Florida by The Albert Brothers and Steve Alaimo. The album was a departure for the band, much more country-oriented than previous releases. The cover art was by William Matthews, a Denver, Colorado artist well known for his Old West-style paintings. Flower Petals was originally slated to be recorded as the follow-up to Miracle Mule in 2004 but was nixed by the band's record company at the time, Back Porch Records. Five years later, the band members financed the recording themselves then shopped around the completed tapes. The Subdudes' stature as New Orleans musicians has recently been reflected by their inclusion individually and as a group in the HBO series Treme. After a hiatus since 2011, the original line-up reunited, with Johnny Ray Allen on bass, in March 2014. Johnny Ray Allen died at age 56 on August 8, 2014. The band has continued to tour with Tim Cook on bass."@en ;

The name predates the Olivia Tremor Control and was in use until Doss's 2012 death. Doss started the project while in high school, going as far as to self-release an album on cassette called A Spiraling World of Pop, later re-released under the Elephant Six banner. Doss then met up with Will Cullen Hart and Jeff Mangum; together, they formed The Olivia Tremor Control, and the Sunshine Fix moniker was put into hiatus (although, as an aside, it became the title of an Olivia Tremor Control song, which appears on the Singles and Beyond compilation). Following the dismantling of Olivia Tremor Control in 2000, Doss began recording under the Sunshine Fix name again, releasing a single and preparing an EP, which was released by Kindercore Records in 2000, featuring members of the Olivia Tremor Control, Of Montreal, Elf Power, and others. In 2001, Doss formed a more stable band, adding Kevin Sweeney and Sam Mixon, and released Age of the Sun on Emperor Norton Records. A tour with The Four Corners followed. In 2001, drummer Dave Gerow joined the fray to tour in support of \"Age of the Sun\" with acts like Guster, Ugly Casanova, and Sloan. They continued touring and recorded Green Imagination at the home of Widespread Panic bassist Dave Schools and mixed by Andy Baker at The Bakery in Athens GA. Green Imagination was released on SpinArt records in 2004. Although the record received a generally muted critical reception, the band continued to tour in its support. Doss continued to record songs for a new Sunshine Fix album until his death. He had said that the new material has a darker direction - \"more Leonard Cohen than John Lennon\" ."@en ;

dbr:Red_Krayola	rdf:type	dbo:Band ;
	dbo:abstract	"Red Krayola (formerly The Red Crayola) was a psychedelic experimental rock band from Houston, Texas, formed by art students at the University of St. Thomas (Texas) in 1966. The band was led by singer/guitarist and visual artist Mayo Thompson, along with drummer Frederick Barthelme (brother of novelist Donald Barthelme) and Steve Cunningham. Their work prefigured punk, post-punk, indie rock and the no wave scene in 1980s New York City. They made noise rock, psychedelia and occasionally folk/country songs and instrumentals in a DIY fashion, an approach that presaged the lo-fi aesthetic of many 1990s US indie rock groups. Reviewing the band has produced conflicted results - in an extremely positive review from Pitchfork Media, critic Alex Lindhardt wrote \"It's a band that has no idea how to play its instruments. In fact, they don't even know what instruments are, or if the guitarist has the ability to remain conscious long enough to play whatever it is a 'note' might be.\" He added, \"This is a band that was paid ten dollars to stop a performance in Berkeley. If Berkeley's not having it, you know you're in for rough sledding.\" Thompson has continued using the name, in its legally required permutation The Red Krayola, for his musical projects since."@en ;

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Barnstorm_(band)>	rdf:type	dbo:Band ;
	dbo:abstract	"Barnstorm was the group created by Joe Walsh in Colorado after he left the James Gang. The original members of the group were Walsh (guitars, keyboards), Joe Vitale (drums, flute, keyboards) and Kenny Passarelli (bass). Walsh and Vitale had previously played together in an Akron-based band called The Measles before Walsh joined the James Gang. All of the members contributed lead vocals and songs, although Walsh was the principal singer and songwriter. Later, the group added keyboardists Rocke Grace and Tommy Stephenson. Having two keyboardists permitted Barnstorm to play the complex arrangements live that it was creating through multitracking in the studio or through the use of session musicians such as Paul Harris (piano) and Joe Lala (percussion). Barnstorm would record only three albums over its three-year life (two as principals, Barnstorm and The Smoker You Drink, the Player You Get, plus serving as the backing band on Michael Stanley's Friends and Legends). All three albums were produced by Bill Szymczyk. Over time, Walsh became particularly frustrated by the way his record company, Dunhill Records, promoted the band, as if they were Joe Walsh solo albums and the others were his backing musicians. Said Walsh, \"I wanted to be a band, not a solo artist. Vitale, especially, should've gotten more credit 'cause it wasn't all me. . . . It was in every aspect a collaborative effort.\" Barnstorm thus disbanded in 1973, although Walsh and Vitale continued to work together on various projects over the next 20 years. Walsh continued to record as a solo artist; in 1975, Walsh joined The Eagles, also produced by Szymczyk. Passarelli joined Harris and Lala in Stephen Stills' band Manassas in 1973, and Elton John's backing band in 1975. Vitale first became a solo artist, but then joined Lala in the Still-Young Band for the Long May You Run album and tour, which led to his joining the Crosby, Stills and Nash backing band, where he was rejoined by Passrrelli. Later, he rejoined Walsh, playing drums and keyboards with The Eagles on tour. Stephenson went on to play with many of the great blues guitarists like Albert King, Albert Collins, and Chuck Berry as well as artists such as Paul Butterfield, Poco and many members of The Band."@en ;

dbr:The_Spinanes	rdf:type	dbo:Band ;
	dbo:abstract	"The Spinanes were an American indie rock band, primarily active during the 1990s. Originally founded by and consisting only of singer-songwriter/guitarist Rebecca Gates and drummer Scott Plouf, the band released three albums on the Sub Pop label before Gates retired the name in 1999 and began releasing music as a solo artist; Plouf began playing with Built to Spill in 1996 and left The Spinanes shortly thereafter to become their permanent drummer. The duo formed in Portland, Oregon, in 1991, just as worldwide interest in the music scene of the Pacific Northwest was beginning to crest. After releasing two singles on the local label IMP Records in 1992, they were signed by Sub Pop, who issued the single \"Spitfire\" in mid-1993, followed that October by their first full-length album, Manos. Much was made of The Spinanes' unorthodox lineup - specifically, the lack of bass guitar - but it proved invaluable in helping them forge a more singular, original sound. In a March 2010 review, nearly two decades after the album's release, eMusic praised them for having \"a sense of negative space that's rare for a rock band\", then went on to describe their sound as \"Gates's dreamy murmur and resonant, open-tuned riffs up top, Plouf's inexorable attack at the bottom, and nothing but air between them.\" Manos became the first album released by an independent label to hit No. 1 on the college radio charts; its second single, \"Noel, Jonah and Me\", received considerable airplay on college and alternative radio stations and video outlets such as MTV's 120 Minutes. A video was also made for a third single, \"Sunday\", in 1994, but the duo's appearances over the following two years were largely limited to separate guest spots on their friends' records. Gates provided backup vocals on Elliott Smith's \"St. Ides Heaven\" (from his self-titled album), as well as on multiple tracks on Ben Lee's first album, Grandpaw Would. Plouf did a brief stint in Team Dresch, and appeared on their first single, \"Hand Grenade\"; he also played on the Beck album One Foot in the Grave. The Spinanes regrouped in 1996 for the release of their second album, Strand, which was bookended by the singles \"Madding\" and \"Lines and Lines\". Elliott Smith, in turn, provides backup vocals, as does John Moen (of Dharma Bums and The Decemberists). Around the same time, Plouf began playing with Built to Spill, but due to that band's signing with Warner Bros. Records, he was unable to continue with both bands full-time, and in 1997, he made the decision to leave The Spinanes. Gates then relocated to Chicago, Illinois, reconfigured The Spinanes as a three-piece with bassist Joanna Bolme and drummer Jerry Busher, and began work on another album at Easley McCain Recording in Memphis, Tennessee. Additional tracks were recorded with John McEntire (of Tortoise and The Sea and Cake) at his Soma Electronic Music Studios, one of which features vocalist Sam Prekop (also of The Sea and Cake). The resulting album, Arches and Aisles, was released in June 1998. An album consisting of early Spinanes singles, Imp Years, came out in 2000."@en ;

The group was composed of Erik Darling and Bill Svanoe (vocals, guitar) with former jazz singer Lynne Taylor (vocals). Darling put the group together in June 1962 specifically to record an updated and uptempo version of a 1929 Gus Cannon folk blues song, \"Walk Right In\". The trio recorded the song for Vanguard Records, with updated lyrics and an arrangement featuring paired 12-string acoustic guitars. The record became the most successful single in Vanguard's history. In the U.S., the song was #1 for two weeks on the Billboard Hot 100 chart in early 1963. It spent five weeks atop the Easy Listening chart, which would later become known as the Adult Contemporary chart. In addition, \"Walk Right In\" reached both the R&B chart (peaking at #4) as well as the country music chart (peaking at #23). The song reached #1 in Australia on the Kent Music Report in 1963, and it made the Top 10 on the UK Singles Chart in the United Kingdom, peaking at #10. The recording sold over one million copies, gaining gold disc status. The album that contained this song was also called Walk Right In, and was nominated for a Grammy Award in the Best Folk Recording category.[citation needed] The group was more influenced by ragtime, blues, and songster material than contemporaneous folk groups such as The Weavers, which Darling belonged to until just before he formed the Rooftop Singers. They were also less overtly political. The group played at the Newport Folk Festival in 1963. Vanguard released several further singles, the most successful being \"Tom Cat\" (#20 in May of '63). Yielding to pressure from her husband, Taylor left the trio shortly after Vanguard released the group's second album, Good Time!. Darling and Svanoe then recruited Mindy Stuart to replace her. This line-up recorded one final album, Rainy River. Patricia Street replaced Stuart shortly before the Rooftop Singers formally disbanded in 1967. Darling and Street continued working as a duo into the early seventies, recording the album The Possible Dream for Vanguard. Lynne Taylor (born in 1928) died in 1982 at age 54, and Erik Darling died on August 3, 2008, aged 74, in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, from Burkitt's lymphoma."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Anderson Bruford Wakeman Howe were a progressive rock band active from 1988 to 1990 that comprised four past members of the English progressive rock band Yes. Singer Jon Anderson left Yes as he felt increasingly constrained by their commercial and pop-oriented direction in the 1980s. He began an album with one of the band's line-ups from the 1970s with guitarist Steve Howe, keyboardist Rick Wakeman, and drummer Bill Bruford, who invited Tony Levin to play bass. The group released their sole studio album, Anderson Bruford Wakeman Howe, in June 1989 which reached number 14 in the UK and number 30 in the US. Their 1989\u201390 world tour was well-received and spawned two live albums, An Evening of Yes Music Plus (1993) and Live at the NEC (2012). In 1990, tracks for a second studio album were included with songs recorded by Yes to make the thirteenth Yes album, Union (1991). This marked the end of Anderson Bruford Wakeman Howe and the start of the eight-member Yes formation until 1992, comprising Anderson Bruford Wakeman Howe and Yes musicians Chris Squire, Trevor Rabin, Tony Kaye, and Alan White."@en ;

dbr:Box_Car_Racer	rdf:type	dbo:Band ;
	dbo:abstract	"Box Car Racer was an American rock band formed in San Diego, California in 2001. The group consisted of guitarist and vocalist Tom DeLonge and drummer Travis Barker of Blink-182, alongside guitarist David Kennedy of Hazen Street. Anthony Celestino later joined the ensemble as a bassist. DeLonge created the project to pursue darker ideas he felt unsuited to his work with Blink-182. He invited Barker in order to refrain from paying a studio drummer, and fellow guitarist David Kennedy, whom DeLonge had met in the San Diego music circuit years prior. Box Car Racer was partly inspired and viewed as a tribute to Jawbox, Quicksand, Fugazi and Refused. The group recorded the band's eponymous debut, Box Car Racer, in quick fashion with a more DIY spirit. MCA Records issued the band's lone release in May 2002, which peaked on the Billboard 200 at number 12. Singles \"I Feel So\" and \"There Is\" also charted on the Modern Rock Tracks chart, with the former shooting to number eight. The band embarked on their sole headlining tour across North America in the fall of 2002 with supporting act The Used. Box Car Racer created unresolved tension within Blink-182 and inevitably influenced the band's following studio album, the more experimental Blink-182 (2003). DeLonge ended the project in mid-2003, considering it to have served its purpose; however, DeLonge's later band, Angels & Airwaves (which also featured Kennedy) has been described by DeLonge as a continuation of Box Car Racer."@en ;

dbr:Eagles_of_Death_Metal	rdf:type	dbo:Band ;
	dbo:abstract	"Eagles of Death Metal is an American rock band from Palm Desert, California, formed in 1998. Founded by Jesse Hughes (vocals, guitar) and Josh Homme (drums), the band also includes a wide range of other musicians that perform both on the band's studio albums and at live shows. Hughes and Homme are the only permanent members of the band, with Homme rarely performing at live shows due to commitments to his other bands. The band's current touring line-up includes Hughes alongside Dave Catching (guitar), Eden Galindo (guitar), Matt McJunkins (bass) and Julian Dorio (drums). Despite their band name, Eagles of Death Metal are not a death metal band. In a video interview taken at a converse music.co.uk sponsored event at the Soho Revue Bar in London, Hughes states that he and Homme were in a bar watching a man dance to the song \"Wind of Change\" by the Scorpions. When asked what he was doing, the man yelled, \"This is death metal, dude!\", to which Homme replied, \"No it's not. This is like the Eagles of death metal.\" An alternate story concerning the origin of the band name claims that the name originated during an exchange in which a friend of Josh Homme was attempting to convert Hughes to the death metal genre. When the friend played a song by the Polish band Vader and made a claim that the song was within the death metal genre, Homme then referred to Vader as \"the Eagles of death metal\". After hearing this phrase, Hughes wondered what a cross between the Eagles and a death metal band would sound like. In a 2003 interview Homme described the sound of the band as a combination of \"bluegrass slide guitar mixed with stripper drum beats and Canned Heat vocals.\" Hughes is known for his enthusiastic interaction with audiences at live performances. While the band were on stage at Le Bataclan in Paris, France, on November 13, 2015, the audience was attacked by terrorists wielding automatic rifles, grenades and suicide vests. The death toll inside the venue was 89, including the group's merchandise manager, but the band members escaped safely out of the venue via a door backstage."@en ;

Celebrating its 50th anniversary in 2012, it is Puerto Rico's most successful musical group, and is considered \"the most popular Salsa group that has ever existed\". The group received the moniker La Universidad de la Salsa (The University of Salsa) in Colombia, due to the sheer number of famous salsa musicians and singers who developed their careers with it, who started with the group (particularly Andy Monta\u00F1ez), or who were occasionally backed up by the band (including Celia Cruz, H\u00E9ctor Lavoe and La India). The Salsa Orchestra was founded in May 1962, by Rafael Ithier. Ithier is still nominally its musical director, and is the only remaining members from the band's original lineup. As of 2010, Willie Sotelo, who joined the group in 2006 as pianist, has become the band's de facto musical director on tours, with Ithier conducting the group and playing occasionally in select live performances. They are still actively performing after 50 years together. The group was scheduled to celebrate its 50th anniversary on 11 November 2012 at the Coliseo de Puerto Rico.

dbr:The_Marshall_Tucker_Band	rdf:type	dbo:Band ;
	dbo:abstract	"The Marshall Tucker Band is an American Southern rock/country rock band originally from Spartanburg, South Carolina. The band's blend of rock, rhythm and blues, jazz, country, and gospel helped establish the Southern rock genre in the early 1970s. While the band had reached the height of its commercial success by the end of the decade, the band has recorded and performed continuously under various lineups for nearly 40 years. The original lineup of the Marshall Tucker Band, formed in 1972, included lead guitarist, vocalist, and primary songwriter Toy Caldwell (1947\u20131993), lead vocalist Doug Gray (born 1948), keyboard player, saxophone player, and flautist Jerry Eubanks (born 1950), rhythm guitarist George McCorkle (1946\u20132007), drummer Paul Riddle (born 1953), and bassist Tommy Caldwell (1949\u20131980). They signed with Capricorn Records and in 1973 released their first LP, The Marshall Tucker Band. After Tommy Caldwell was killed in an automobile accident in 1980, he was replaced by bassist Franklin Wilkie. Most of the original band members had left by the mid-1980s to pursue other projects. The band's current lineup consists of Gray on vocals, keyboard player and flautist Marcus James Henderson, guitarist Rick Willis, bassist Pat Elwood, and drummer B.B. Borden."@en ;

dbr:The_Statler_Brothers	rdf:type	dbo:Band ;
	dbo:abstract	"The Statler Brothers (sometimes referred to in country music circles as simply The Statlers) were an American country music, gospel, and vocal group. The quartet was founded in 1955 and began their career backing Johnny Cash. Originally performing gospel music at local churches, the group billed themselves as The Four Star Quartet, and later The Kingsmen. In 1963, when the song \"Louie, Louie\" by the garage rock band also called The Kingsmen became famous, the group elected to bill themselves as The Statler Brothers. Despite the name, only two members of the group (Don and Harold Reid) are actual brothers and none have the surname of Statler. The band, in fact, named themselves after a brand of facial tissue they had noticed in a hotel room (they joked that they could have turned out to be the Kleenex Brothers). Don Reid sang lead; Harold Reid, Don's older brother, sang bass; Phil Balsley sang baritone; and Lew DeWitt sang tenor and was the guitarist of the Statlers before being replaced by Jimmy Fortune in 1983 due to DeWitt's ill health.DeWitt died on August 15, 1990, of heart and kidney disease, stemming from complications of Crohn's disease. The band's style was closely linked to their gospel roots. \"We took gospel harmonies,\" said Harold Reid, \"and put them over in country music.\" The group remained closely tied to their gospel roots, with a majority of their records containing at least one gospel song. They produced several albums containing only gospel music and recorded a tribute song to the Blackwood Brothers, who influenced their music. The Statler Brothers also wrote a tribute song to Johnny Cash, who discovered them. The song was called \"We Got Paid by Cash\", and it reminisces about their time with Cash."@en ;

The band was formed in 1980 by Zoran Vulovi\u0107 \"Vule\" (keyboards), Milan Del\u010Di\u0107 \"Del\u010Da\" (vocals) and Aleksandar Vasiljevi\u0107 \"Vasa\" (guitar), who decided to expand the lineup of their former band to Milo\u0161 Obrenovi\u0107 (drums) and Aleksandar Luki\u0107 (bass guitar), and change their name to U \u0160kripcu. At the time of their formation, the band was a part of the Yugoslav new wave scene, the period of work which was documented on the seminal 1981 various artists compilation album Artisti\u010Dka radna akcija. With the debut album release, the 1982 Godine ljubavi, the band moved towards a more experimental post-punk sound, before achieving nationwide commercial success with the release of the album O je! and EP Nove godine!, under the influence of New Romanticism. The original lineup recorded yet another album, the synthpop Budimo zajedno, which was did not repeat the commercial success of its predecessors, causing the band to disband in 1985. In 1986, Vulovi\u0107 and Del\u010Di\u0107 reformed the band, but the latter soon left the band, so the new lineup, featuring the vocalist Aleksandar Taba\u0161 and various musicians, recorded the fourth studio album, U \u0160kripcu. Despite the hit song \"Vreme je za nas\", the album was not commercially successful, causing the band to disband in 1988. The following year, Vulovi\u0107 reunited with Del\u010Di\u0107 and Vasiljevi\u0107, Luki\u0107 on guitar, bassist Dejan \u0160kopelja, and drummer Ratko Ljubi\u010Di\u0107. The lineup recorded the critically acclaimed fifth studio album Izgleda da mi smo sami, after which the band disbanded. Following the disbandment, Vulovi\u0107 became a producer and manager, Del\u010Di\u0107 pursued a solo career with his band Sklekovi, and Vasiljevi\u0107 and Luki\u0107 became a part of the supergroup Familija. In 2007, the original lineup reunited at the Del\u010Da i Sklekovi concert at the Belgrade Dom Omladine, which was released in 2008 as Ljubilarnih 20 i ne\u0161to godina - Live, under the moniker Del\u010Da a i U \u0160kripcu.

After performing as an opening act for Pankrti in April 1980, Mihajlovi\u0107 left the band and the remaining three members changed their name to \u0160arlo Akrobata. Subsequently, the trio recorded four tracks which were released on the 1981 compilation album Paket aran\u017Eman, now considered to be one of the most influential releases in the history of former Yugoslav rock music. During 1981, the band released their debut album Bistriji ili tuplji \u010Dovek biva kad..., after which, owing to irreconcilable differences between the band members, the band ceased to exist. The album received critical recognition and is regarded as one of the most notable albums of former Yugoslav rock music.

They recorded two albums. The first was a 1968 self-titled album for the Elektra label, on which the personnel comprised Day, Pierson, Maury Baker (organ, percussion), Giovanni Papalia (lead guitar), Bill Folwell (trumpet, bass, vocals), and Jonathan Raskin (bass, guitar, vocals). The band was signed to Elektra by Paul Rothchild, who produced their self-titled album in Los Angeles, with additional songwriting by Greg Copeland and released in April 1968. However, the band split up after a performance supporting The Doors at the Fillmore East in mid-1968, about the same time as they were hyped with a profile in Life magazine. Day and Pierson then formed a new version of the band, with guitarist Sam Brown, trumpeter Jimmy Owens, bassist Art Koenig, keyboardist Warren Bernhardt and drummer Joe Hunt.

The band was formed in 1981 in Vancouver, and originally consisted of vocalist Dale Martindale, guitarist Don Gordon (later of Numb), synth players Joe Vizvary and Glen Nelson, bassist Gary Smith and percussionist Kevin Crompton (better known as cEvin Key). The band's manager was Kim Clarke Champniss, later to become a MuchMusic VJ. The band released four EPs before their full-length debut, 1985's In the House. Their first notable chart hit was \"Lust for Love\", from the 1983 self-titled EP. Gordon left the band in 1984, and was replaced by Ed Shaw. Their song \"In the House\" won the 1986 CASBY Award for Single of the Year, with the band named Group of the Year. Crompton left Images in Vogue in 1986, indicating that the band was too commercial for his tastes, and concentrated on his side project Skinny Puppy. Crompton was replaced by Derrick Gyles. Nelson also left the same year, and was replaced by Tim Welch. The band considered changing its name to The Spell while recording its 1988 album, but discovered that an Australian band was already using that name. The album ended up titled as The Spell, but the band remained Images in Vogue. That album was not commercially successful, however. By June 1988, Images in Vogue could no longer count on the support of its record label and this, combined with the band's internal conflicts, influenced Gary Smith to leave the band. Images in Vogue's final concert featuring original content was at Toronto's Opera House in November 1991, after which the band unofficially split as members pursued different ventures. Since then, the band has continued to release various compilation CDs featuring remixes and live, rare and unreleased songs; additionally, rare, commercially unreleased tracks are made available for download by the band at its website. Images in Vogue reunited for gigs at Toronto's Opera House in 2002 and at Vancouver's Commodore Ballroom in 2004, and again in Toronto in 2012 as a special guest opening act for Spoons at their 30th anniversary show for their Arias and Symphonies album. The song \"Lust for Love\" was featured in an episode of Being Erica entitled \"Erica the Vampire Slayer\", in which she travels back in time to 2001 to attend a vampire-themed role play party."@en ;

The band currently consists of primary songwriter and core member John Dwyer (vocals, guitar), Tim Hellman (bass) and drummers, Ryan Moutinho and Dan Rincon. Thee Oh Sees sound incorporates a wide range of rock genres, including 1960s garage rock and psychedelic rock, punk rock, noise rock, art punk, and 1980s post-punk. Initially an outlet for Dwyer (Coachwhips, Pink and Brown and The Hospitals) to release experimental home recordings, Thee Oh Sees evolved into a full band, featuring Brigid Dawson (vocals, keyboard), Petey Dammit (bass, guitar), Mike Shoun (drums), and Lars Finberg (drums, guitar). Over the course of several releases and genre transitions, the band became noted for their prolific discography, energetic live shows, and whimsical visual aesthetic. The band has changed its lineup and name several times, having previously being known as Orinoka Crash Suite, OCS, Orange County Sound, The Ohsees and The Oh Sees. In late 2013, it was announced that the band would be entering a hiatus. A new studio album, however, entitled Drop, was released in 2014, and the Thee Oh Sees subsequently toured as a three-piece, with Sic Alps bassist Tim Hellman and White Fence drummer Nick Murray replacing Dawson, Dammit!, and Shoun. In 2015, Dawson returned to the band, in a studio capacity, for its next studio album, Mutilator Defeated At Last. Following its release, Dwyer and Hellman began touring with two drummers, Ryan Moutinho and Dan Rincon, replacing Murray."@en ;

The duo consisted of singer AnNa R. and musician Peter Plate, who occasionally provided vocals. Rosenstolz achieved major chart success after the nineties, with five studio albums going to No. 1 in the German albums chart. Although the duo split up to pursue separate music careers, they left open the possibility of a future reunion. Rosenstolz's music was described by critics as containing elements of various genres, including pop and chanson. However, comparisons with schlager were strongly disputed by the duo, who defined themselves simply as a pop group. Rosenstolz's repertoire included ballads and quirky pop songs, though later years saw the duo eschewing their quirky side. Common themes in the songs written by Rosenstolz were sex, love and emotions."@en ;

The band also performed at a number of venues across the country, supporting bands such as The Cribs and To My Boy. They cancelled their headline UK tour due to exhaustion after touring Europe supporting the band Kaiser Chiefs, and to free up time to write new material, but were due to reschedule all cancelled dates.

Weilerstein formed the group that summer at the Marlboro Music School and Festival with violinist Peter Salaff, violist Martha Strongin Katz, and cellist Paul Katz. The group was initially called the \"New Cleveland Quartet.\" In 1971, the group left the Cleveland Institute because of disagreements over teaching loads and took up residency at the University at Buffalo, The State University of New York; they dropped the word \"New\" from their name at this time. In 1976 they made their final change of residency, moving to the Eastman School of Music in Rochester, New York. The quartet had three personnel changes: violist Atar Arad replaced Strongin Katz in 1980; violist James Dunham then replaced Arad in 1987; and William Preucil replaced Weilerstein as first violin in 1989. The quartet disbanded in 1995. Preucil became concertmaster of the Cleveland Orchestra, a position he still holds. Paul Katz, Martha Strongin Katz and Donald Weilerstein are on the faculty of the New England Conservatory of Music, and Weilerstein performs in a trio with his wife Vivian Hornik Weilerstein and his daughter, cellist Alisa Weilerstein; Peter Salaff is on the faculty of the Cleveland Institute of Music; Atar Arad teaches at the Jacobs School of Music at Indiana University; and James Dunham teaches at the Shepherd School of Music at Rice University.

Nightwish is Finland's most successful band with more than 7 million sold albums worldwide, 1 silver award, 11 gold awards and 30 platinum awards. Although Nightwish has been prominent in their home country since the release of their first single, \u201CThe Carpenter\u201D (1997) and debut album Angels Fall First, they did not achieve worldwide fame until the release of the albums Oceanborn, Wishmaster and Century Child, which were released in 1998, 2000 and 2002 respectively. Their 2004 album, Once, which has sold more than 1.2 million copies, led to Nightwish video clips being shown on MTV in the United States and inclusion of their music in US movie soundtracks. Their biggest US hit single, \u201CWish I Had an Angel\u201D (2004), made it onto three US film soundtracks as a means to promote their North American tour. The band produced three more singles and two music videos for the album, as well as \u201CSleeping Sun\u201D, from the 2005 \u201Cbest of\u201D compilation album, Highest Hopes, prior to vocalist Tarja Turunen\u2019s dismissal.

Formed in '99 by bassist Ricci Gurango after his departure from Hungry Young Poets, MOJOFLY reeled in mainstream and alternative crowds alike with the debut album Birth Day (1999) and follow-up A Million Stories (2002), both released under Sony BMG Philippines. Then-lead singer Kitchie Nadal helped propel singles such as Another Day and Scooter Boy to national recognition. But in May 2003, Nadal left the group to embark on a solo career. Mojofly then introduced Lougee Basabas as the band\u2019s new frontwoman in only a matter of days. By year\u2019s end the group joined the \u201Cindie\u201D bandwagon with their self-titled EP, sold-out despite being available only in gigs. Because of Mata and the revived, revv-ed up Lougee-version of Minamalas, MOJOFLY (EP) showed the new sound of their group. The band went on to release an LP aptly entitled MOJOFLY Now (June, 2005), still under independent label luKas Music of artist manager and music publisher Karin Araneta. This time distributed nationwide by EMI Music Philippines, Lougee took over the reins in songwriting and gained MOJOFLY \u201Cstreet cred\u201D through her novel, cutting-edge compositions. Currently promoting MOJOFLY Now Special Edition (August, 2006), the 2-disc package marries the original \u201805 full-length and an A-VCD featuring live tracks from their first major concert at the Music Museum (September, 2005) and the 3D-animated music video of Tumatakbo. MOJOFLY is the first local artist to venture into full 3D animation in Philippine music video history. The work was previewed at the 19th Singapore International Film Festival (April, 2006) and won Best Animated Video and Favorite Indie Video at the MTV Pilipinas Video Music Awards 2006] (August, 2006). Apart from once garnering the much-coveted slot for MTV Lokal Artist-of-the-Month (March, 2005), MOJOFLY also boasts a list of celebrity endorsements from Del Monte Pizza Sauce to Penshoppe and Cream Silk Conditioners. The theme song Choose and vast multi-media exposure from the Cream Silk \u201CGirl Power, Pink Power\u201D campaign brought MOJOFLY\u2019s sound and Lougee\u2019s vivid image into every household. On 2008, Ricci Gurango, the last original member of MOJOFLY, left the band. The remaining members took in Richard Carandang and Ace Evangelista to play the bass and lead guitar. With the new members, the band decided to rename their group as Delara."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"OneRepublic is an American pop rock band. Formed in Colorado Springs, Colorado in 1996 by Ryan Tedder and Zach Filkins, the band achieved commercial success on Myspace as an unsigned act. In late 2003, after OneRepublic played shows throughout the Los Angeles area, a number of record labels approached the band with interest, but OneRepublic ultimately signed with Velvet Hammer, an imprint of Columbia Records. They made their first album with producer Greg Wells during the summer and fall of 2005 at his studio, Rocket Carousel, in Culver City, California. The album was originally scheduled for release on June 6, 2006, but the group was dropped by Columbia two months before the album ever came out. The lead single of that album, \"Apologize\", was released in 2005. It received some recognition on Myspace in 2006. In 2007, OneRepublic released their debut album, Dreaming Out Loud. Its lead single, \"Apologize\", was notably remixed by Timbaland, becoming a huge international success, reaching number one in sixteen countries, subsequently earning them a Grammy Award nomination. The second single, \"Stop and Stare\", mirrored its predecessor's success. The album was later certified Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). The band's second album, Waking Up (2009), produced the successful singles, \"All the Right Moves\", \"Secrets\", \"Marchin On\", and \"Good Life\", with Good Life reaching the top ten of the US Billboard Hot 100. OneRepublic's third album, Native (2013), became the band's first top ten album on the Billboard 200, and highest charting album to date, charting at number four. The lead single, \"If I Lose Myself\", charted within the top ten in several countries, while the album's third single, \"Counting Stars\", became the band's most successful single in recent years, obtaining top five placements in Australia, Canada, Germany, Ireland, New Zealand, the U.S. and the UK. This marks their highest charting single in the United Kingdom to date. It has also peaked at number 2 on the US Billboard Hot 100, matching their highest peak of \"Apologize\" in 2007."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Sariola is a female fronted extreme dark metal band from Germany consisting of an international line-up featuring members from Germany, Ukraine and Belarus. Sariola was founded by E.Konny and Anagnorisis in the year 2005. E.Konny already played black metal-based music with clear, operatic vocals in his former bands Divina Nocturna / Spectra Selene (1997\u20132004). After a short time, Silenia Tyrvenis, singer of E.Konny's former project, joined Sariola. The Band started immediately the recording of their first album, entitled \"Sphere of Thousand Sunsets\". Due to personal reasons Silenia Tyrvenis left the band. After several line up changes, a new line up crystallized: Loreley Von Rhein - vocals, Leandra Ophelia Dax - keyboards, Anagnorisis - lead guitars, Morbid - drums, Sturm - rhythm guitars. Following by live concerts and open air festivals with bands like [:SITD:], Ensiferum, Psyche, Pro-Pain, Imperia, Hail of Bullets, Sariola offered live performance on the stages of Europe. In May 2009 SARIOLA released an EP entitled \"Deathfrozen Silence\" containing an early version of four songs from the upcoming album \"From The Dismal Sariola\". The musical mixture of the EP improves the typical elements of SARIOLA and gained positive reviews by international press. As result of a demand, Sariola completely re-recorded their first album \"Sphere Of Thousand Sunsets\" with the new line-up without using any original tracks. The worldwide internet release was in May 2012. The next album of Sariola was scheduled according to the interview for Swedish \"Battle Helm\"-Zine for winter 2012/2013 After major line up changes Sariola produced their very first music video to the song \"From the dismal Sariola\". The song itself was recorded in multiple studios. Anagnorisis went to the parlour studios (where bands like Napalm Death an the Exploited produced their work) in Kettering, UK to record guitars. The track was mastered by Russ Russell. 2 further tracks where recorded in L\u00FCbeck, Germany at Lasse Lammert's LSD studio. The EP \"From the dismal Sariola\" released in September 2014 by the German label 7HARD received good critics and the band perform their first European tour supporting the NWOBHM pioneers Blitzkrieg and performed several headliner shows."@en ;

The group consists of members Olga Seryabkina, Polina Favorskaya, and Dasha Shashina. Serebro was formed in 2007 as a submitted proposal for consideration by Channel One Russia for the Eurovision Song Contest 2007. Serebro was selected to represent Russia at the 2007 Contest with the song titled \"Song #1\". They subsequently placed third at the contest, scoring a total of 207 points. Serebro was then officially signed to Fadeev's record label Monolit Records, and in 2012, the group had additional releases produced by Sony Music Entertainment and Ego Music. During 2009, member Marina Lizorkina announced her departure from the group; she was subsequently replaced by Anastasia Karpova. With Lizorkina at the time, the band recorded their debut studio album OpiumRoz. The album received critical acclaim and spawned other singles in addition to \"Song #1\", but it never became a commercial success. The band's second album, called Mama Lover, proved to be much more successful. It included the massive hit of the same name and went double platinum in Russia. The eponymous \"Mama Lover\" hit single received media attention worldwide, with reviewers commenting on both the raunchy music video and the song itself. The music video for the song received more than 20 million views on YouTube and became the subject of more than 250 parodies. After the success of \"Mama Lover\", the group began to garner commercial attention around the world. The group re-released Mama Lover in Japan (under the name Serebration) after signing a contract with EMI Music. Their first international single under Ego Music and Universal Music Group, \"Mi Mi Mi\", became a success on European music charts. In late September, member Anastasia Karpova announced her departure from the group in order to pursue a solo career and was replaced with new member, named Dasha. After their musical and image development, the group became known for a very sexually charged and over the top style. Some of their music videos have led to controversy in the media, including \"Mama Lover\" and \"Mi Mi Mi\"."@en ;

dbr:The_Monterays	rdf:type	dbo:Band ;
	dbo:abstract	"The Monterays, featuring the distinctive vocals of Dan Elliott, are the longest working band in Upstate New York. Formed in 1962, The Monterays were well established on the Syracuse scene in the 1960s, and after a decade layoff in the 1970s, continue to play over 100 dates a year. The band was formed in East Syracuse, New York in 1962 by Jack Abert (bass guitar/Hawaiian guitar), John Wisnewski (guitar/vocals), Larry Landry (rhythm guitar) and Jack Holton, who was soon replaced by Tommy Forrest (drums/lead vocals). Early inspirations were The Beach Boys, surf music and the theatrics of East Syracuse's first rock and roll band, The Sabres, featuring the talented lead guitarist Ron Lauback. The Monterays developed a loyal following with Syracuse teenagers, so much so that they found themselves at Riposo Studios in the fall of 1964 to wax their first single, the Beatles meets Beach Boys original \"Bye Bye\", and the Larry Santos penned \"Sheryl-ane\". (\"Sheryl-ane\" was also recorded by Utica, New York act The Madisons for MGM Records in 1965)After this single came and went, The Monterays signed a management deal with \"Dandy\" Dan Leonard, a popular disc jockey for WNDR (1965). He was able to arrange another recording sessions for the band, this time in New York City, which resulted in the Larry Santos penned \"I'll Be Around\" on the A side, with the Madisons on side B. The single was released on the Twin Hit label, and went on to sell 500 copies in Upstate New York. At this point Landry and Forrest departed (both joined the military) and were replaced by Dan Elliott (n\u00E9e Rubado) (lead vocals)and Dave Moziak (rhythm guitar) (ex-The Dimensions) and drummer Dave Usiatynski (Tommy Forrest took up the lead vocal duties for another popular Syracuse band The Saint and the Sinners also featuring guitarist Ron Lauback). This is the version of The Monterays that created the most buzz around New York State. Things seemed to be looking up, Dan Leonard booked them into various clubs and live functions (scoring a major coup by getting the band an opening slot on the Beach Boys concert at the Syracuse War Memorial in July 1966. The third single \"Very Last Day\"/\"You Belong To My Heart\" (Sahara Rec. #118) was released in late 1966 and sold about as well the last one. The Monterays scored another coup by wooing away keyboardist George Day from The Saint and the Sinners just in time to record their fourth single \"If Wishes Were Horses\"/\"Conquistador\". The single was recorded again at Riposo Studios, produced by Dan Leonard and the A side featured Thomas Bacon on French Horn. Released on the tiny Buff Records label, \"If Wishes Were Horses\" (Buff # 323681) took off regionally, and The Monterays soon found themselves on A&M Records's radar. A&M ultimately passed, preferring to sign the band Procol Harum instead (\"Conquistador\" was written by Procol Harum members Brooker/Reid but recorded by The Monterays first). Without the promotional support of a major label, \"If Wishes were Horses\" peaked at ##88 on the Cashbox charts in October 1968. By this time, The Monterays (Elliott/Abert/Moziak/Wisnewski/Usiatynski/Day) were now a seven piece, with Tommy Forrest returning on vocals. Unfortunately, family and outside interests began to tear the band apart, and The Monterays split in 1969. Dan Elliott resurfaced with the rock band Wilksbury Brigade, before joining The Glenn Miller Orchestra in 1973. A year later, he joined The Belmonts (of Dion and the Belmonts fame) and continues to perform with them. George Day opened Dayson Studios, recording many top Upstate New York musicians from 1970-1987. George Day also became involved with Ron Wray who curated the Syracuse area artists rock and roll album series in the 1970s and '80s. Tommy Forrest remained active as well, fronting local act The Seven into the early 70s. In 1978, The \"Wishes\"-era Monterays reformed for a one off show at The Beginning club in Syracuse NY to over two thousand people. But after Dan Elliott left California after finishing work on H.B. Halicki's film The Junkman, he reformed The Monterays permanently. Now called Dan Elliott and the Monterays, they've been a mainstay on the Syracuse scene since, recording a single for the Belmonts-owned AIR Records label (\"Stay Awhile\"/\"Ruby Baby\" 1983), and winning a SAMMY (Syracuse Area Music Awards) lifetime achievement award in 1996. The group has undergone some major changes in recent years, with the departures of Jack Abert in 2002 (Jack stayed on as executive producer and live sound mixer), George Day in 2004, and Dave Moziak in 2005. Ron Lauback joined the band in 2002 first as a replacement for Jack Abert, then switching to lead guitar in 2005 with the departure of Dave Moziak. His son Ronnie Dark was added on drums in 2003. Other members in the 2000s included Rob Medugno on keyboards (2005\u20132007), Brian Carr (bass/vocals 2005-2011), and Wayne Muller (keyboards 2007\u2013present). Founding member Jack Abert died on August 16, 2009 in Florida. Longtime bassist Brian Carr departed in October 2011. The band has reshuffled their line-up again with Ronnie Dark taking over bass guitar duties. Ron's first replacement on drums, Teddy O Ted Boileau left in August 2012. The current line-up is Dan Elliot, Ron Lauback, Ronnie Dark, Wayne Muller and Dave Miller, another former member of the group. 2012 marks The Monterays' 50th year in the music business."@en ;

Although \"I Think We're Alone Now,\" reaching No. 45 in 1977, has been their only charting hit, the group has a significant enduring cult following among fans of the power-pop genre. More recently, the group became known to a wider audience after filing a plagiarism lawsuit in mid-2007 against Canadian pop-punk musician Avril Lavigne claiming that her song \"Girlfriend\" had too much in common with \"I Wanna Be Your Boyfriend\". The parties confidentially settled out of court in early 2008. The conflict led to a re-interest in the Rubinoos' music, particularly on YouTube."@en ;

The group was formed by Kristian W\u00E5hlin after the dissolution of Grotesque, a precursor to At the Gates, and for a very brief time featured the band's core members (Tomas Lindberg, Anders Bj\u00F6rler and Alf Svensson). By the time songwriting materialized for the EP Spiritually Uncontrolled Art in 1992, the line-up consisted of Christofer Johnsson (vocals), Wahlin and Johan \u00D6sterberg (guitars), Mattias Gustavsson (bass guitar) and Hans Nilsson (drums). The band played two shows in Poland and produced a Slayer cover for a record company compilation, but due to instability of the line-up, the group ultimately dissolved in 1995. Johnsson would resume work as leader of symphonic death metal band Therion; Daniel Erlandsson would play drums for In Flames, Eucharist, and Armageddon before settling with popular melodic death metal band Arch Enemy; and Wahlin, Osterburg and Nilsson would go on to form Diabolique. The following year, Nilsson would also join Dimension Zero."@en ;

Bijelo Dugme is widely considered to have been the most popular band ever to exist in the former Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and one of the most important acts of the Yugoslav rock scene. Bijelo Dugme was officially formed in 1974, although the members of the default lineup, guitarist Goran Bregovi\u0107, vocalist \u017Deljko Bebek, drummer Ipe Ivandi\u0107, keyboardist Vlado Pravdi\u0107 and bass guitarist Zoran Red\u017Ei\u0107, were previously active under the name Jutro. The band's debut album Kad bi bio bijelo dugme, released in 1974, brought them nationwide popularity with its folk-influenced hard rock sound. The band's future several releases featured similar sound, maintaining their popularity, but in the early 1980s, with the emergence of Yugoslav new wave scene, the band moved towards new wave, managing to remain one of the most popular bands in the country. After the departure of Bebek in 1983, the band was joined by vocalist Mladen Voji\u010Di\u0107 \"Tifa\", with whom the band recorded only one, self-titled album, with which the band moved towards pop rock. The band's last vocalist, Alen Islamovi\u0107, joined the band in 1986, and with him Bijelo Dugme recorded two albums, disbanding, with the rising tensions in Yugoslavia, in 1989. In 2005, the band reunited in the lineup that featured most of the musicians that passed through the band, including all three vocalists, for three concerts, in Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina, in Zagreb, Croatia and in Belgrade, Serbia."@en ;

In May 2009, after over two years of no updates, Stefy released four new demos on their MySpace page.

dbr:General_Caine	rdf:type	dbo:Band ;
	dbo:abstract	"General Kane (known as General Caine before 1986) was an American music group fronted by Mitch McDowell (born Mitchell Leon McDowell on June 29, 1954, in San Bernardino, California; died January 22, 1992 in San Bernardino). McDowell took the professional name General Kane in tribute to an officer who had supported his artistic ambitions when he was at military school. After leaving that institution, he formed the group Booty People with several future members of War. They released one album for MCA Records. Malcolm assembled an eight-piece funk group and signed with Groove Time Records in 1978, releasing two albums: Let Me In (1978) and Get Down Attack (1980). The group then moved to Tabu Records. General Caine's third album entitled Girls features the hit song \"For Lovers Only\". The radio station 93.1 FM WZAK in Cleveland (Ohio) penned \"For Lovers Only\" as a theme song for their late night segment with the same title. Their debut single for the Tabu label and the fourth album Dangerous with many song writing chores, were done by Johnny Guitar Carson. After a brief appearance at Capitol Records with one single released called \"Where's The Beef ?\" (a popular catch phrase at that time), a slimmed down version of the group with new writers and producers signed a recording contract with Motown Records in the mid-1980s. With a slightly new name (from General Caine to General Kane to reflect the changes in the band's lineup) and sound, they debuted for the new Motown Records label with the album In Full Chill. \"Crack Killed Applejack\" was an uncompromising reflection of drug addiction on the inner city streets and reached number 12 in the black music charts despite being barred from airplay. Subsequent releases mellowed General Kane's approach without losing their commitment to the basic rap sound of the late 80s. The group's album Wide Open did include a romantic ballad, \"Close Your Eyes\", which featured vocals from two of the group's less prominent members, Cheryl McDowell and Danny Macon. Mitch McDowell pursued a career in law enforcement as a bail bondsman after leaving the music industry. He was murdered in January 1992 along with a nephew, Akili John Davis, 18, who worked in his office. Police noted that the office safe was empty. General Kane's catalogue remained in print through the efforts of their former producer, Grover Wimberly III, who runs his own label, Groove Time Records."@en ;

Although the band members referred most often to their style as experimental music, their music has been characterized as free jazz, and as punk jazz. Their music has also been compared to that of Frank Zappa. Their album Amoebiasis, although recorded in Providence in late 1996 and early 1997, was released on the French record label Stupeur et Trompette! The people who ran the label also organized the Mouvement Internationale des Musiques Innovatrices experimental music festival, and took notice when Amoebic Ensemble performed there in 1996. The album was produced by Tom Buckland, except for \"Lay Down in the Road\", which was produced by Joe Auger. Subsequent to Amoebiasis's release, primarily as a result of members being busy in other music projects, percussionists Paige Van Antwerp and Jonathan Thomas, as well as trumpeter Shawn Wallace all left the band. Gerry Heroux took over as trumpeter, and Mark Pedini joined on drums. Matthew Everett changed from bouzouki and mandolin to electric guitar instead."@en ;

dbr:APO_Hiking_Society	rdf:type	dbo:Band ;
	dbo:abstract	"The Apolinario Mabini Hiking Society, later popularly known as APO Hiking Society, or simply APO, was a Filipino musical group. The group had its fledgling beginnings in 1969 at the Ateneo de Manila high school, with fourteen members: Lito de Joya, Sonny Santiago, Gus Cosio, Renato Garcia, Chito Kintanar, Kenny Barton, Bruce Brown, Butch Dans, Kinjo Sawada, Ric Segreto, Goff Macaraeg, Doden Besa, Jim Paredes, and Boboy Garovillo. The group's name was created from the acronym AMHS representing their school with a witty twist having an irreverent reference to the paralyzed Philippine revolutionary intellectual and hero, Apolinario Mabini, and later shortened to \"Apo\", an Ilocano term for a wise man or a Tagalog term of grandchildren, and later re-branded to \"APO\" (all caps). Contrary to popular belief, the \"Apo\" name was not a reference to the Philippines's highest peak, the potentially-active stratovolcano Mount Apo. As the students advanced into college, Danny Javier joined the group. After graduation, the majority of its members left to pursue individual careers, with only three members remaining, made up of Jim Paredes, Boboy Garovillo and Danny Javier. In the span of their professional career, Apo emerged as a principal adherent of the musical movement termed Original Pilipino Music (a.k.a. OPM), a milieu in which their original musical contributions and cultural influence became essential. The Apo became involved in record production, talent management and organizing artists under the Organisasyon ng Pilipinong Mang-aawit (O.P.M., ). The group expanded its activities into establishing and furthering the careers of new OPM artists in the Philippines. To date, the group has released 27 albums in four decades of its career. Two hugely successful tribute albums were produced in 2006 and 2007 by its management group, featuring numerous young bands freshly reinterpreting Apo's expansive repertoire. The group frequently utilized their brand name, \"Apo,\" as a clever component for Tagalog puns in titles for television shows, live programs and marketing materials, for example, as in nA PO, which transliterates as \"already\" (polite/formal usage), and also as ap\u00F3 (meaning, \"grandchild\"). The puns have been minimally extended into English, as in (APOcalyptic).[citation needed]"@en ;

dbr:Aerosmith	rdf:type	dbo:Band ;
	dbo:abstract	"Aerosmith is an American rock band, sometimes referred to as \"the Bad Boys from Boston\" and \"America's Greatest Rock and Roll Band.\" Their style, which is rooted in blues-based hard rock, has come to also incorporate elements of pop, heavy metal, and rhythm and blues, and has inspired many subsequent rock artists. The band was formed in Boston, Massachusetts in 1970. Guitarist Joe Perry and bassist Tom Hamilton, originally in a band together called the Jam Band, met up with vocalist/pianist/harmonicist Steven Tyler, drummer Joey Kramer, and guitarist Ray Tabano, and formed Aerosmith. In 1971, Tabano was replaced by Brad Whitford, and the band began developing a following in Boston. They were signed to Columbia Records in 1972, and released a string of gold and platinum albums, beginning with their 1973 eponymous debut album, followed by Get Your Wings in 1974. In 1975, the band broke into the mainstream with the album Toys in the Attic, and their 1976 follow-up Rocks cemented their status as hard rock superstars. Two additional albums followed in 1977 and 1979. Their first five albums have since attained multi-platinum status. Throughout the 1970s, the band toured extensively and charted a dozen Hot 100 singles. By the end of the decade, they were among the most popular hard rock bands in the world and developed a loyal following of fans, often referred to as the \"Blue Army\". However, drug addiction and internal conflict took their toll on the band, which led to the departures of Perry and Whitford in 1979 and 1981, respectively; they were replaced by Jimmy Crespo and Rick Dufay. The band did not fare well between 1980 and 1984, releasing the album Rock in a Hard Place, which was certified gold but failed to match their previous successes. Perry and Whitford returned to Aerosmith in 1984 and the band signed a new deal with Geffen Records. After a comeback tour, the band recorded Done with Mirrors (1985), which won some critical praise but failed to come close to commercial expectations. It was not until the band's collaboration with rap group Run\u2013D.M.C. in 1986, and the 1987 multi-platinum release Permanent Vacation, that they regained the level of popularity they had experienced in the 1970s. In the late 1980s and 1990s, the band scored several hits and won numerous awards for music from the multi-platinum albums Pump (1989), Get a Grip (1993), and Nine Lives (1997), and embarked on their most extensive concert tours to date. The band also became a pop culture phenomenon with popular music videos and notable appearances in television, film, and video games. Their comeback has been described as one of the most remarkable and spectacular in rock 'n' roll history. Additional albums followed in 2001, 2004, and 2012. Since 2001, the band has toured every year except 2008. After 46 years of performing, the band continues to tour and record music. Aerosmith is the best-selling American hard rock band of all time, having sold more than 150 million records worldwide, including over 70 million records in the United States alone. With 25 gold albums, 18 platinum albums, and 12 multi-platinum albums, they hold the record for the most total certifications by an American group and are tied for the most multi-platinum albums by an American group. The band has scored 21 Top 40 hits on the Billboard Hot 100, nine number-one Mainstream Rock hits, four Grammy Awards, six American Music Awards, and ten MTV Video Music Awards. They were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2001, and were included among both Rolling Stone's and VH1's lists of the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time. In 2013, the band's principal songwriters, Tyler and Perry, were inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame."@en ;

First operating under the name Wildcountry, the group toured the Southeast bar circuit in the early 1970s, and began writing original songs.

Alabama's first single on RCA Records, \"Tennessee River\", began a streak of number one singles, including \"Love in the First Degree\" (1981), \"Mountain Music\" (1982), \"Dixieland Delight\" (1983), \"If You're Gonna Play in Texas (You Gotta Have a Fiddle in the Band)\" (1984) and \"Song of the South\" (1987). The group's popularity waned slightly in the 1990s, although they continued to receive hit singles and multi-platinum record sales. Alabama disbanded in 2006 following a farewell tour and two albums of inspirational music, but reunited in 2011 and have continued to record and tour worldwide. The band's blend of traditional country music and Southern rock combined with elements of gospel, and pop music gave it a crossover appeal that helped lead to their success. They also toured extensively and incorporated production elements such as lighting and \"sets\" inspired by rock concerts into their shows. The band has over 30 number one country records on the Billboard charts to their credit and have sold over 75 million records, making them one of the world's best-selling bands of all time. AllMusic credited the band with popularizing the idea of a country band, and wrote that \"it's unlikely that any other country group will be able to surpass the success of Alabama.\""@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Anal Cunt, also known as AxCx and A.C., was an American grindcore band that formed in Newton, Massachusetts in 1988. Since its inception, the band underwent a number of line-up changes. Known for its grindcore musical style and controversial lyrics, Anal Cunt released eight full-length studio albums in addition to a number of compilations and extended plays. On June 11, 2011, the band's frontman and founder Seth Putnam died of a suspected heart attack, ending the band. They have been categorized as grindcore, noisecore, noisegrind and hardcore. The band is often referred to by their initials A.C. (often written as AxCx) due to the offensive nature of their name and censorship limits on some radio and publications, and many of their album covers simply display the initials A.C. However, the band managed to subvert even this abbreviation by drawing these letters in a manner resembling an anus and a vulva. Their early material contained no pre-written lyrics or music. Rather, the band developed a style which consisted of extremely loud, fast, and aggressive noise that was created entirely on the spot. Over the years, the band eventually shifted their style and slowly began to incorporate more riffs and pre-written lyrics into their songs. It was not until then that the band earned the reputation for intentionally being outrageous and offensive. In 2011, they released a \"cock rock\" album entitled Fuckin' A. An album of material similar to their old grindcore albums called Wearing Out Our Welcome was released digitally in 2010."@en ;

The group is perhaps best known currently for the international Top 20 singles \"Kiss\" and the instrumental \"Peter Gunn\", the latter of which won a 1986 Grammy Award. The group's mostly instrumental compositions were novel melodic sound collages based on digital sampler technology, which was new at the time. Inspired by turn-of-the-20th-century revolutions in music, the Art of Noise were initially packaged as a faceless anti- or non-group, blurring the distinction between the art and its creators. The band is noted for innovative use of electronics and computers in pop music and particularly for innovative use of sampling. From the earliest releases on ZTT, the band referred to itself as both Art of Noise and The Art of Noise. Official and unofficial releases and press material use both versions."@en ;

The quartet had a close relationship with composer Dmitri Shostakovich, who personally consulted them on each of his quartets. They also performed with the pianist Sviatoslav Richter on many occasions. They have recorded all of Shostakovich's string quartets as well as all of Beethoven's quartets. Their many recordings include works by a wide range of composers on the Melodiya, Teldec, Virgin Records, and Chandos Records labels. The original Borodin quartet's sound was characterised by an almost symphonic volume and a highly developed ability to phrase whilst maintaining group cohesion.[citation needed] Although it has seen many changes in personnel over its life span, all members of the quartet have been graduates of the Moscow Conservatory."@en ;

Formed in 1965, the group defined the San Francisco Sound and was the first from the Bay Area to achieve international commercial success. They were headliners at the three most famous American rock festivals of the 1960s\u2014Monterey (1967), Woodstock (1969) and Altamont (1969)\u2014in addition to the first Isle of Wight Festival (1968) in England. Their 1967 break-out record Surrealistic Pillow ranks on the short list of most significant recordings of the \"Summer of Love\". Two songs from that album, \"Somebody to Love\" and \"White Rabbit\", are among Rolling Stone's \"500 Greatest Songs of All Time.\" The \"classic\" line-up of Jefferson Airplane remained stable from 1967 to early 1970, and consisted of Marty Balin, Jack Casady, Spencer Dryden, Paul Kantner, Jorma Kaukonen and Grace Slick. The group broke up in 1972, and essentially split into the two bands, Hot Tuna and Jefferson Starship.

	dbo:abstract	"Phenomena is a rock concept around a supergroup formed by record producer Tom Galley, Metalhammer magazine founder Wilfried Rimensberger and Tom's brother, Whitesnake guitarist Mel Galley. Contributors were leading rock musicians such as Glenn Hughes, Brian May, Tony Martin and John Wetton amongst others. In a cover story, run by Kerrang! magazine in 1985, Phenomena's production of rock songs based on a story line running through a whole album, attached to artworks and other multi-media aspects was credited for the \"return of the concept album\" in the 1980s. Phenomena released three albums in the 1980s and early 1990s, and had a number one hit single in South America with \"Did It All For Love\", while the album charted across Europe, in Japan and Brazil. An accompanying music video was shot and produced by Rimensberger in conjunction with Spidercom Films at London's Abbey Road Studios, and represented a video trailer for the Phenomena - Dream Runner movie project. More albums followed without the involvement of Rimensberger and released under the branding of 'Tom Galley, the creator of Phenomena'. The latest, Awakening, was released in March 2012. Whilst all were well received, they were not comparable to the original Phenomena as they lack the typical concept story running through the whole album, international, mixed genre musicians\u2019 matrix and multi-media links. In interviews Tom makes clear, that these albums released under a solo contract with the Escape label, should not be compared with the original Phenomena. He has recently joined forces again with Rimensberger and the 2 are working together again for the first time in 25 years. There were rumours in 2014 of both the band playing live at Sweden Rock Festival in June 2014, plus a secret gig in London previous to the event. But they proved to be unfounded."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Stone Temple Pilots (often abbreviated as STP) is an American rock band from San Diego, California, that originally consisted of Scott Weiland (lead vocals), brothers Dean (guitar) and Robert DeLeo (bass, backing vocals), and Eric Kretz (drums). Since the band's formation in 1989, its line-up remained unchanged until the dismissal of Weiland in 2013, who was replaced by Linkin Park vocalist Chester Bennington. In 2015, Bennington left the band to focus solely on Linkin Park. On December 3, 2015, Weiland was found dead on his tour bus prior to a performance with his band The Wildabouts. In 2016, the band launched an online audition for a new lead vocalist. After forming in 1989 under the name Mighty Joe Young, the band signed with Atlantic Records and changed its name to Stone Temple Pilots. The band found immediate success in 1993 upon releasing their debut album, Core (1992), and went on to become one of the most commercially successful bands of the 1990s. The band released four more studio albums: Purple (1994), Tiny Music... Songs from the Vatican Gift Shop (1996), No. 4 (1999) and Shangri-La Dee Da (2001), before separating in 2002, after which the band members partook in various projects (most notably Velvet Revolver and Army of Anyone). The band eventually reconvened in 2008 for a reunion tour, released a new self-titled album in 2010, and have been actively touring since, even after Weiland was fired from the band. The band's only material with Bennington was the EP High Rise in 2013. While initially displaying a sound typically identified as grunge early on in its career, further releases from the band expressed a variety of influences, including psychedelic rock, bossa nova and classic rock. The band's evolution throughout the 1990s and early 2000s involved several tumultuous periods of commercial highs and lows, brought about in part by Weiland's well-publicized struggles with drug addiction."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Stormtroopers of Death, known as S.O.D., was an American crossover thrash band formed in New York in 1985. They are credited as being among the first bands to fuse hardcore punk with thrash metal into a style sometimes referred to as crossover thrash, and is also known for reuniting Anthrax members Scott Ian (guitars) and Charlie Benante (drums) with their former bassist Dan Lilker. The song \"Milano Mosh\" from their 1985 debut album, Speak English or Die, was the Headbanger's Ball intro anthem for many years. The band were the source of some controversy due to the deliberately racist and misogynist lyrics. Bassist Dan Lilker stated: \"The lyrics were never intended to be serious, just to piss people off.\" The band had several periods of inactivity following their formation in 1985. According to singer Billy Milano, the 24-song extended play of live and unreleased material called Rise of the Infidels, released in August 2007 on Megaforce Records, \"will finally be the last of S.O.D.,\" laying to rest rumors of another reunion."@en ;

dbr:Tangerine_Dream	rdf:type	dbo:Band ;
	dbo:abstract	"Tangerine Dream are a German electronic music group founded in 1967 by Edgar Froese. The group has seen many personnel changes over the years, with Froese being the only continuous member until his death in January 2015. Noted electronic music artist, drummer, and composer Klaus Schulze was briefly a member in an early lineup. The best known and most constant line-up of the group, which worked during their most influential mid-1970s period, was a trio with Froese, Christopher Franke, and Peter Baumann. In the late 1970s, Johannes Schmoelling replaced Baumann, and this lineup was stable and extremely productive as well. Tangerine Dream's recorded output has been prolific, having released over one hundred albums. Their work with the Ohr electronic music label, a period called the \"Pink Years\" because of a pink ear included in Ohr's logo, produced albums that had a pivotal role in the development of the musical genre known as krautrock. Their \"Virgin Years,\" so-called because of their association with Virgin Records, produced albums that helped define what became known as the Berlin School of electronic music. These and later albums were influential in both the development of electronic dance music and also new-age music, although the band themselves disliked that term. From the late 1990s into the 2000s, Tangerine Dream continued to explore other styles of electronica. Even with their many studio and live recordings, many fans were introduced to Tangerine Dream by their film soundtracks. The group created over sixty soundtracks which include those for the films Sorcerer, Thief, Risky Business, The Keep, Firestarter, Legend, Near Dark, Shy People, and Miracle Mile. They also composed the score for the video game Grand Theft Auto V."@en ;

dbr:The_Churchills	rdf:type	dbo:Band ;
	dbo:abstract	"The Churchills (or The Churchills Band) was an Israeli band founded in 1965, active until the mid-1970s. It was a part of the rhythm bands scene that were active in Israel in the 1970s, especially in Ramla. The band played rock music in English, from psychedelic rock to hard rock and progressive rock. It was also active in other countries, under the aliases of Jericho Jones and Jericho. It was one of the first Israeli rock bands. The band was a leading force in the early Israeli beat scene, but it was their cooperation with Arik Einstein that helped them cross over to the mainstream of Israeli pop and gain recognition. Their collaboration with Einstein proved to be very influential on Israeli rock. It began when the Churchills were invited to work with Einstein on his third solo album Poozy, recorded in 1969. This is considered by many to be the first rock album in Hebrew. The Churchills played on half of the tracks in that album, one of which was a Hebrew version of one of their own songs (\"When You're Gone\"). Following Poozy, the Churchills also played with Einstein in his gigs, and continued to play and produce three more albums with Einstein: Shablul (1970), Plastelina (1970) and On Avigdor's Grass (1971). Contributory to the Churchills' sound at the time was the joining of two foreign members: Canadian vocalist Stan Solomon and British guitarist Robb Huxley (formerly with The Tornados)."@en ;

dbr:The_Clash	rdf:type	dbo:Band ;
	dbo:abstract	"The Clash were an English punk rock band that formed in 1976 as part of the original wave of British punk. Along with punk, their music incorporated elements of reggae, dub, funk, ska and rockabilly. For most of their recording career the Clash consisted of Joe Strummer (lead vocals, rhythm guitar), Mick Jones (lead guitar, lead vocals), Paul Simonon (bass guitar, vocals) and Nicky \"Topper\" Headon (drums, percussion). Headon left the group in 1982, and internal friction led to Jones's departure the following year. The group continued with new members, but finally disbanded in early 1986. The Clash achieved commercial success in the United Kingdom with the release of their debut album, The Clash, in 1977. Their third album, London Calling, released in the UK in December 1979, earned them popularity in the United States when it was released there the following month. It was declared the best album of the 1980s a decade later by Rolling Stone magazine. In 1982 they reached new heights of success with the release of Combat Rock, which spawned the US top 10 hit \"Rock the Casbah\", helping the album to achieve a 2\u00D7 Platinum certification there. Their final album, Cut the Crap, was released in 1985. The Clash's politicised lyrics, musical experimentation, and rebellious attitude had a far-reaching influence on rock, alternative rock in particular. They became widely referred to as \"The Only Band That Matters\", originally a promotional slogan introduced by the group's record label, CBS. In January 2003, shortly after the death of Joe Strummer, the band\u2014including original drummer Terry Chimes\u2014were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. In 2004, Rolling Stone ranked the Clash number 28 on their list of the 100 greatest artists of all time. Critic Sean Egan summarised what made them exceptional by writing, \"They were a group whose music was, and is, special to their audience because that music insisted on addressing the conditions of poverty, petty injustice, and mundane life experienced by the people who bought their records. Moreover, although their rebel stances were often no more than posturing, from the Clash's stubborn principles came a fundamental change in the perception of what is possible in the music industry, from subject matter to authenticity to quality control to price ceilings.\""@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"The Firm were a British rock supergroup comprising former Free and Bad Company singer Paul Rodgers, guitarist Jimmy Page formerly of The Yardbirds and Led Zeppelin, and Manfred Mann's Earth Band and Uriah Heep drummer Chris Slade and bass player Tony Franklin. Both Page and Rodgers refused to play any material from their former bands and instead opted for a selection of Firm songs plus tracks from both their solo albums. The new songs were heavily infused with a soulful and more commercially accessible sound, courtesy of Franklin's fretless bass guitar underpinning an understated song structure. Despite refusing to play old material, the last track from The Firm, \"Midnight Moonlight\", was originally an unreleased Led Zeppelin song entitled \"Swan Song\". This caused some critics to believe that Page had begun to run out of ideas. In subsequent press interviews, Page had indicated that the band was never meant to last more than two albums. After the band split, Page and Rodgers returned to solo work while Chris Slade joined AC/DC and Franklin teamed up with guitarist John Sykes in Blue Murder."@en ;

The band was formed as a quartet by songwriter and former Hall\u00E9 Orchestra percussionist Dick Witts in 1978, but later became a trio. Witts produced the band's recordings and sang on most of their releases, the occasional lead vocal being taken by Tony Friel or Andy Wilson. Although they never truly broke into the mainstream, their most successful song was 'XOYO' which came 41st in John Peel's Festive Fifty for 1982, which was the top 50 songs of the year as voted by the listeners. The song was an experiment to see whether John Cage's method of aleatoric composition could be successfully applied to popular music composition. XOYO also appeared on the Cherry Red compilation album Pillows & Prayers. The band broke up in 1983. Dick Witts is now a lecturer and has taught at Edinburgh University, Goldsmiths University in London and currently teaches at Edge Hill University in Lancashire. Andy Wilson is a club and radio DJ based mainly in Ibiza. Joe Mckechnie is a producer/remixer/DJ based in Liverpool. He has released records on Acacia (Detroit) Ochre (UK), Blood (UK) and Aspro (Holland) amongst others. Recent remixes include Ladytron/ROC and Echo & the Bunnymen.

The latest lineup features Puscifer and Ashes Divide bassist Matt McJunkins; former The Smashing Pumpkins guitarist James Iha; and Puscifer and Ashes Divide touring drummer, Jeff Friedl. Despite having a varied cast since inception, the stylistic content of the songs has remained consistent with Howerdel as composer, and Keenan penning the lyrics and melodies. A Perfect Circle has released three albums: Mer de Noms (2000), Thirteenth Step (2003), and Emotive (2004). A CD-DVD set, Amotion, was released alongside Emotive released and contains thirteen music videos in addition to a number of song remixes created by Danny Lohner, Robert Del Naja, and other artists. The band went into hiatus in 2004. Since then, band members have worked on other projects, the most notable being Keenan's work on Tool's 2006 album, 10,000 Days, and Howerdel's album, Keep Telling Myself It's Alright, under Ashes Divide, his name for his solo work. The two announced they had reformed to work on new material in late 2008, although the band was not publicly active until 2010, when the band began touring again. On November 19, 2013, the band released a greatest hits album entitled Three Sixty, which contains one new song, \"By and Down\", and on November 26, 2013, the band released a box set entitled A Perfect Circle Live: Featuring Stone and Echo.

	dbo:abstract	"Atomic Kitten are an English pop girl group formed in Liverpool in 1998 whose current members are Liz McClarnon, Natasha Hamilton, and Kerry Katona. The band was formed by Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark (OMD) frontman Andy McCluskey, who served as a principal songwriter during their early years. Sugababes singer Heidi Range was included in the original line-up but was replaced by Hamilton. The group's debut album Right Now was released in October 2000 and peaked at number 39 in the UK. After four top ten singles, Katona quit the group and was replaced by former Precious singer Jenny Frost. \"Whole Again\", their next single, became their most successful single when it topped the UK singles chart and became the 13th best-selling single of the 2000s. The group re-released their debut album, with some tracks re-recorded with Frost's vocals. The album hit number one in the UK with the album going double platinum after selling over 600,000 copies in the UK. Between 2002 and 2004, the group released a further two studio albums, Feels So Good (which also went double platinum in the UK) and Ladies Night, and a greatest hits album before announcing a break following their 2004 tour. To date the group have had three UK number-one singles: \"Whole Again\", the fourth-best-selling song of all time by a girl group; \"Eternal Flame\", a song originally recorded by The Bangles; and \"The Tide Is High (Get the Feeling)\", a song originally recorded by The Paragons and by Blondie. The group split up in 2004 after selling over 10 million records worldwide. After making sporadic appearances in 2006 and 2008, it was announced that McClarnon, Hamilton, and Katona would reunite for the ITV2 series The Big Reunion, along with five other pop groups of their time\u2014B*Witched, Five, Liberty X, Honeyz and 911. Frost was unable to take part in the comeback because of her pregnancy, but Hamilton has since confirmed that Frost would be welcomed back if she wanted to rejoin the group in the future. In November 2014, Atomic Kitten revealed that they would be releasing a new album in 2015, accompanied by a tour."@en ;

dbr:Barenaked_Ladies	rdf:type	dbo:Band ;
	dbo:abstract	"Barenaked Ladies (often abbreviated BNL or occasionally BnL) is a Canadian rock band. The band is currently composed of Jim Creeggan, Kevin Hearn, Ed Robertson, and Tyler Stewart. Barenaked Ladies formed in 1988 in Scarborough, Ontario (now incorporated into the City of Toronto) as a duo of Robertson and Steven Page. Jim Creeggan and his brother Andrew \"Andy\" Creeggan joined at the end of 1989, and Stewart was added in 1990 while Andy was on a brief hiatus from the group. Andy left the band after its second album in 1995 and was replaced by Hearn. Page left in 2009, leaving the group as a quartet. Upon forming, the band quickly developed a cult following in their native Canada culminating in their self-titled 1990 cassette becoming the first independent release ever to be certified gold in Canada. The band then received a major record deal with Reprise Records. Its label debut, Gordon was released in 1992. The band's style has evolved greatly throughout its career, and its music which began as exclusively acoustic quickly grew to encompass a mixture of a wide array of styles including pop, rock, hip hop, rap, etc. They are most commonly billed as an \"alt rock\" band. The band's cult following translated into immediate success with Gordon in Canada with a number of popular singles including \"If I Had $1000000\" and \"Brian Wilson\", but it was not until the band's 1996 live album, Rock Spectacle with its singles, live versions of \"The Old Apartment\" and \"Brian Wilson\", and its 1998 fourth studio album, Stunt that the band finally found success in the United States. The lead single from Stunt, \"One Week\" remains the band's most successful single. Other well-known singles include Stunt's second, \"It's All Been Done\", and the lead single from the follow-up album Maroon, \"Pinch Me\". These and other singles remain in radio rotation in both Canada and the United States. In 2007, Robertson wrote and the band recorded a theme song for the sitcom The Big Bang Theory for which the band has also become well-known. The band is also known for their light-hearted, comedic performance style and humorous banter between songs: improvised raps/songs are staples at most concerts. They have won multiple Juno Awards and have been nominated for Grammy Awards. The group has sold over 15 million records including albums and singles."@en ;

Pioneering the folk rock genre, Buffalo Springfield, along with the Byrds, combined elements of folk and country music with British invasion influences into their early works. Their second studio album, Buffalo Springfield Again, marked their progression to psychedelia and hard rock. With a name taken from a steamroller, the group signed to Atlantic Records in 1966 and released their debut single \u201CNowadays Clancy Can\u2019t Even Sing\" - a regional hit in Los Angeles. The following December, the group released the protest song they were most prominently known for, \"For What It's Worth\". After various drug-related arrests and line-up changes, the group decided to break up in 1968. Stephen Stills went on to form the folk rock supergroup Crosby, Stills & Nash with David Crosby of the Byrds and Graham Nash of the Hollies. Neil Young had launched his successful solo career and reunited with Stills in Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young in 1969. The group was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1997."@en ;

A few months before the 2003 invasion of Iraq D.A.F. released \"The Sheriff (An Anti-American Song)\".

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gang_of_Four_(band)>	rdf:type	dbo:Band ;
	dbo:abstract	"Gang of Four are an English post-punk group, formed in 1977 in Leeds. The original members were singer Jon King, guitarist Andy Gill, bass guitarist Dave Allen and drummer Hugo Burnham. There have been many different line-ups including, among other notable musicians, Sara Lee and Gail Ann Dorsey. After a brief lull in the 1980s, different constellations of the band recorded two studio albums in the 1990s. Between 2004 and 2006 the original line-up was reunited; as of 2013, Gill is the sole original member. The band plays a stripped-down mix of punk rock, funk and dub, with an emphasis on the social and political ills of society. Gang of Four are widely considered one of the leading bands of the late 1970s/early 1980s post-punk movement. Their early 80s albums (Songs of the Free and Hard) found them softening some of their more jarring qualities, and drifting towards dance-punk and disco. Their debut album, Entertainment!, ranked at Number 483 in Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time, and is listed by Pitchfork Media as the 8th best album of the 1970s. David Fricke of Rolling Stone described Gang of Four as \"probably the best politically motivated band in rock & roll.\""@en ;

They released only one album, 1979's (GI) (produced by Joan Jett) and were featured the following year in Penelope Spheeris' documentary film The Decline of Western Civilization, which chronicled the Los Angeles punk movement. Germs disbanded following Crash's suicide on December 7, 1980. Their music was influential to many later punk rock acts. Pat Smear went on to achieve greater fame performing with Nirvana and Foo Fighters. In 2005 actor Shane West was cast to play Crash in Germs' biographical film What We Do Is Secret (named after a song by Germs). He performed with Smear, Doom, and Bolles at a production party for the film, after which Germs reformed with West as singer.

	dbo:abstract	"Hole was an American alternative rock band that formed in Los Angeles, California in 1989 by singer and guitarist Courtney Love and lead guitarist Eric Erlandson. The band had a revolving line-up of bassists and drummers, their most prolific being drummer Patty Schemel, and bassists Kristen Pfaff (d. 1994) and Melissa Auf der Maur. Over the duration of their career, Hole went on to become one of the most successful female-fronted rock bands of all time, with their studio albums selling over three million records in the United States alone. Initially prolific in Los Angeles' punk rock scene, the band collaborated with Kim Gordon for their critically acclaimed debut album, Pretty on the Inside (1991), following it with the more commercially viable Live Through This (1994), which was widely acclaimed and reached platinum status within a year of its release. With Love's lyrics explicitly discussing issues of body image, identity, and sexual exploitation, Hole became the most high-profile musical group of the 1990s to discuss feminist issues in their songs, and also gained considerable media coverage due to Love's reckless and disturbing live performances. Their third release, the more polished Celebrity Skin (1998), garnered them four Grammy nominations. In 2002 the group disbanded to pursue other projects. In 2009, Hole was reformed by Love with new members, despite Erlandson's claim that the reformation breached a mutual contract he had with Love; the reformed band released the album Nobody's Daughter (2010). In 2014, Love confirmed in interviews with BBC and Pitchfork that she was writing new material and that a reunion with the band's previous members had future potential, though the date was indeterminate."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Journey is an American rock band that formed in San Francisco in 1973, composed of former members of Santana and Frumious Bandersnatch. The band has gone through several phases; its strongest commercial success occurred between 1978 and 1987. During that period, the band released a series of hit songs, including 1981's \"Don't Stop Believin'\", which in 2009 became the top-selling track in iTunes history amongst songs not released in the 21st century. Its parent studio album, Escape, the band's eighth and most successful, reached No. 1 on the Billboard 200 and yielded another of their most popular singles, \"Open Arms\". Its 1983 follow-up album, Frontiers, was almost as successful in the United States, reaching No. 2 and spawning several successful singles; it broadened the band's appeal in the United Kingdom, where it reached No. 6 on the UK Albums Chart. Journey enjoyed a successful reunion in the mid-1990s and later regrouped with a series of lead singers. Sales have resulted in two gold albums, eight multi-platinum albums, and one diamond album (including seven consecutive multi-platinum albums between 1978 and 1987). They have had eighteen Top 40 singles in the US (the second most without a Billboard Hot 100 number one single behind Electric Light Orchestra with 20), six of which reached the Top 10 of the US chart and two of which reached No. 1 on other Billboard charts, and a No. 6 hit on the UK Singles Chart in \"Don't Stop Believin'\". In 2005, \"Don't Stop Believin'\" reached No. 3 on iTunes downloads. Originally a progressive rock band, Journey was described by AllMusic as having cemented a reputation as \"one of America's most beloved (and sometimes hated) commercial rock/pop bands\" after 1978, when they redefined their sound by embracing pop arrangements on their fourth album, Infinity. According to the Recording Industry Association of America, Journey has sold 47 million albums in the U.S., making them the 28th best-selling band. Their worldwide sales have reached close to 90 million records, making them one of the world's best-selling bands of all time. A 2005 USA Today opinion poll named Journey the fifth best American rock band in history. Their songs have become arena rock staples and are still played on rock radio stations across the world. Journey ranks No. 96 on VH1's 100 Greatest Artists Of All Time."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Maroon 5 is an American pop rock band that originated in Los Angeles, California. Before the current group was established, the original four members, Adam Levine (lead vocals, lead guitar), Jesse Carmichael (rhythm guitar, backing vocals) Mickey Madden (bass guitar) and Ryan Dusick (drums), formed a band, known as Kara's Flowers, in 1994 while they were still in high school. The band, which self-released an album called We Like Digging?, then signed to Reprise Records and released the album The Fourth World in 1997. After the album garnered a tepid response, the band parted ways with the record label and the members attended college. In 2001, the band changed its image by adding guitarist James Valentine and pursuing a new direction under the name Maroon 5. At this point, Carmichael switched to playing keyboards, which has since become his main instrument in the band. After these changes, Maroon 5 signed with a subsidiary of J Records, Octone Records, and released their debut album, Songs About Jane, in June 2002. The album's lead single, \"Harder to Breathe\", received heavy airplay, which helped the album to debut at number six on the Billboard 200 chart. In 2004, the album went platinum and has been dubbed \"the sleeper hit of the millennium\". The band won the Grammy Award for Best New Artist in 2005. For the next few years, Maroon 5 toured extensively worldwide in support of Songs About Jane and produced two live recordings: 2004's 1.22.03.Acoustic and 2005's Live \u2013 Friday the 13th. In 2006, Dusick officially left Maroon 5 after suffering from serious wrist and shoulder injuries and was replaced by Matt Flynn. The band then recorded their second album, It Won't Be Soon Before Long and released it in May 2007. The album reached number one on the US Billboard 200 chart and the lead single, \"Makes Me Wonder\", became the band's first number-one single on the Billboard Hot 100. In September 2010, Maroon 5 released their third studio album Hands All Over, which was re-released in 2011 to include the single \"Moves like Jagger\". While the original version of the album received mixed reviews, \"Moves like Jagger\" reached the number one position on the Billboard Hot 100. The band released their fourth album, Overexposed, on June 26, 2012. All four singles of the album were highly successful on the Billboard Hot 100, including second single \"One More Night\", which reached number one. In 2014, the band signed with Interscope Records and released their fifth studio album, V. Maroon 5 released a music video for one of their hit songs from this album called \"Sugar\" that currently has over one billion views on Youtube. This video contains all of the band members surprising newlyweds at their wedding reception and performing for them. Fans seemed to respond to this video in a positive manner by giving the video well over four million likes. Overall, this single along with the music video assisted the band in reaching success with their 5th album. The album, which debuted atop the Billboard 200, was recorded with the very-first line-up of six official band members, as keyboardist and backing vocalist PJ Morton became an official member in 2012. The same year, a longtime friend of the band and the bass player of Phantom Planet, Sam Farrar, became an official touring member, playing many different instruments (including guitars, percussion and additional keyboards), singing backing vocals and also providing samples on the MPC. Maroon 5 has sold more than 20 million albums and 70 million singles worldwide."@en ;

dbr:Midnight_Oil	rdf:type	dbo:Band ;
	dbo:abstract	"Midnight Oil (also known informally as \"The Oils\" to fans[citation needed]) were an Australian rock band originally performing as Farm from 1972 with drummer Rob Hirst, bass guitarist Andrew James and keyboard player/lead guitarist Jim Moginie. While vocalist Peter Garrett was studying at Australian National University in Canberra, he answered an advertisement for a spot in Farm, and by 1975 the band was touring the east coast. By late 1976, Garrett moved to Sydney to complete his law degree, and Farm changed its name to Midnight Oil by drawing the name out of a hat. Important to their development was manager Gary Morris who was able to negotiate favourable contracts with tour promoters and record companies and frustrate rock journalists. Guitarist Martin Rotsey joined in 1977 and Midnight Oil, with Morris, established their own record label Powderworks, which released their debut eponymous album in November 1978, and their first single \"Run by Night\" followed in December. Founding bass guitarist James, forced to leave due to illness in , was replaced by Peter Gifford. Gifford was himself replaced by Bones Hillman in 1987. Through a long and distinguished career, the band became known for its driving hard-rock sound, intense live performances and political activism, particularly in aid of anti-nuclear, environmentalist and indigenous causes. Midnight Oil's albums which peaked in the Australian Top Ten were 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, Red Sails in the Sunset, Species Deceases, Diesel and Dust, Blue Sky Mining, Scream in Blue (Live), Earth and Sun and Moon, Breathe, 20,000 Watt R.S.L., Redneck Wonderland, The Real Thing, Capricornia and Flat Chat. Australian Top Ten singles were \"Power and the Passion\", \"The Dead Heart\", \"Beds Are Burning\" and \"Blue Sky Mine\". Aside from chart success, both \"Power and the Passion\" and \"Beds Are Burning\" were listed by Australasian Performing Right Association (APRA) in the Top 30 best Australian songs of all time in 2001, a chart in which Midnight Oil are the only artists to feature twice. In December 2002, Garrett announced that he would seek to further his political career and Midnight Oil disbanded. But they would reform for two warm-up shows in Canberra leading up to their performance at one of the \"Sound Relief\" charity concerts, in honour of the victims of the 2009 \"Black Saturday\" fires in Victoria and floods in Queensland. Midnight Oil won eleven Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) Awards during its career, including induction into the Hall of Fame in 2006. At the induction, ARIA chairman Denis Handlin described Midnight Oil as true legends that always led by example in a uniquely Australian way with music that is powerful, uncompromising, inspiring, entertaining and enduring. In 2010, their album Diesel and Dust ranked no. 1 in the book The 100 Best Australian Albums by Toby Creswell, Craig Mathieson and John O'Donnell."@en ;

Originally a new wave synthpop outfit, Ministry changed its style to industrial metal in the mid-1980s. Ministry found mainstream success in the early 1990s with its most successful album Psalm 69: The Way to Succeed and the Way to Suck Eggs (1992) and touring as part of the Lollapalooza festival. After 27 years of performing, Jourgensen decided to end the band in 2008, saying a reunion would never happen. However, in August 2011, a reunion was announced, when Ministry confirmed they would play one of their first shows in four years at the Wacken Open Air festival in August 2012. Ministry released a new album, Relapse, on March 23, 2012, which was followed by a world tour. Following the death of long time guitarist Mike Scaccia, Ministry released their final album From Beer to Eternity in September 2013, and subsequently began to tour again with new guitarist Cesar Soto."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Misfits are an American punk rock band often recognized as the progenitors of the horror punk subgenre, blending punk rock and other musical influences with horror film themes and imagery. Founded in 1977 in Lodi, New Jersey the original lineup consisted of singer and songwriter Glenn Danzig, guitarist Jimmy Battle, bassist Diane DiPiazza, and drummer Manny Mart\u00EDnez. Following the departure of DiPiazza, Danzig and bassist Jerry Only were the only consistent members throughout the next six years. During this time they released several EPs and singles, and with Only's brother Doyle as guitarist, the albums Walk Among Us (1982) and Earth A.D./Wolfs Blood (1983), both considered touchstones of the early-1980s hardcore punk movement. Misfits disbanded in 1983 and Danzig went on to form Samhain and then the eponymous Danzig. Several albums of reissued and previously unreleased material were issued after the group's dissolution, and their music became influential to punk rock, heavy metal, and alternative rock music of the late 1990s and early 2000s. After a series of legal battles with Danzig, Only and Doyle regained the rights to record and perform as the Misfits. They formed a new version of the band in 1995 with singer Michale Graves and drummer Dr. Chud. This incarnation of Misfits had a sound much more rooted in heavy metal, and released the albums American Psycho (1997) and Famous Monsters (1999) before dissolving in 2000. Jerry Only then took over lead vocals and recruited former Black Flag guitarist Dez Cadena and former Ramones drummer Marky Ramone for a Misfits 25th Anniversary tour. This lineup released an album of cover songs entitled Project 1950 and toured for several years. In 2005 Ramone was replaced by Robo, who had played with Black Flag in the early 1980s and had also previously been Misfits' drummer from 1982 to 1983. This lineup released a single titled \"Land of the Dead\" in 2009. The Misfits' lineup of Only, Cadena, and drummer Eric \"Chupacabra\" Arce released a new album titled The Devil's Rain in October 2011. In 2015 it was announced that Cadena would be taking a break from music after receiving a cancer diagnosis, and was replaced by Only's son Jerry Caiafa II. That same year Soulfly's Marc Rizzo joined the band, also playing guitar."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Motion City Soundtrack is an American rock band from Minneapolis, Minnesota, formed in 1997. The band consists of founding members Justin Pierre (lead vocals and guitar) and Joshua Cain (lead guitar and backing vocals), along with keyboardist and moog synthesist Jesse Johnson, bassist and backing vocalist Matthew Taylor, and drummer, percussionist and backing vocalist Claudio Rivera. Motion City Soundtrack has released six studio albums and sold almost 600,000 records throughout their career, including over half a million in the United States alone. Motion City Soundtrack's first release was a 7\" single, \"Promenade/Carolina\", in 1999. The following year they released their debut EP, Kids for America, and then a second, Back to the Beat. They released their debut album I Am the Movie twice, in 2002. Their first five releases were all self-released with the aid of a small record label. Backed up by their constant touring it fashioned them a fast-growing fan base, and a signing with Epitaph Records. After spending their first five years finding the right lineup, the Epitaph re-issue of I Am the Movie in 2003 was the band's big break. First major single \"The Future Freaks Me Out\" arrived with live and television success, but failed in radio airplay and the charts. 2003 and 2004 brought three Split EPs alongside Schatzi, Limbeck and Matchbook Romance. The second album, Commit This to Memory, has been their most successful album to date, selling 285,000+ records and peaking at number two on the Independent Albums chart. The band released their third full-length album Even if It Kills Me in 2007. The album debuted at number 16 on the Billboard 200 and number one on the Independent Albums chart. It produced singles \"Broken Heart\", \"This Is for Real\" and \"It Had to Be You\", which all received television airplay. Motion City Soundtrack released a fourth album entitled My Dinosaur Life in January 2010, which debuted at number 15 on the Billboard 200. It is their first album released on Columbia, a major record label. Motion City Soundtrack's fifth studio album, Go, was released June 12, 2012. The group's sixth album, Panic Stations, was released on September 18, 2015."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Ned's Atomic Dustbin are an English rock band formed in Stourbridge in West Midlands in November 1987. The band took their name from an episode of The Goon Show. The band are unusual for using two bass players in their lineup: Alex Griffin plays melody lines high up on one bass, and Mat Cheslin plays the regular bass lines on the other. This gives the band a tense and highly driven sub-hardcore sound featuring distorted effects-laden guitar and energetic drums. The band was formed while at sixth form college and they recorded their first album while some of the members were still teenagers. This led to a strong teenaged fanbase with a reputation for enjoying crowd surfing and moshing at their gigs. The band was also noted (and occasionally ridiculed) for their early image, which consisted of uniformly crimped hair and a predilection for sporting shorts and band or skateboard T-shirts. \"The Neds\" (as their fans referred to them) were well known for their own distinctive T-shirts, reportedly producing over 86 different designs within three years (1987\u20131990).

The band is known for their debut single \"You Get What You Give\", which topped the charts in Canada and New Zealand, became a top 5 hit in the United Kingdom, was in the top 40 in the US, and whose lyrics, which insulted celebrities at the end of the song, provided a minor media spectacle. Tired of touring and promotional interviews, Alexander disbanded the group in mid-1999 before the release of their second single, \"Someday We'll Know\", to focus on writing and producing songs for other artists. Alexander and Brisebois' songwriting partnership continued following the disbanding of the group, with the two being nominated for the Academy Award for Best Original Song in 2015 for their composition \"Lost Stars\" from the film Begin Again."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"OSI is an American progressive rock band, originally formed by Fates Warning guitarist Jim Matheos in 2002. Chroma Key keyboardist and vocalist Kevin Moore is the only other full-time member of the band. The collaboration may be considered a studio project, as its members and contributors write and track most of their material independently, sharing and developing tracks long-distance, only coming together at the end of the process for mixing and additional tracking. The band's name is a reference to the Office of Strategic Influence, a short-lived American government agency formed in 2001 to support the War on Terror through propaganda. The band has featured a number of guest musicians on its albums, including Sean Malone, Steven Wilson, Mikael \u00C5kerfeldt, Joey Vera and Gavin Harrison. Matheos recruited Moore, Dream Theater's then-drummer Mike Portnoy and Sean Malone (Fretless Bass and Chapman Stickist) to perform on what was originally planned to be a Matheos solo album. Matheos and Portnoy originally planned to produce a progressive metal album similar to Matheos' work in Fates Warning, however Moore's impact changed the music's direction and genre, incorporating electronica into the original progressive metal sound. The band's debut album was released by InsideOut Music in 2003. OSI was originally intended to be a one-off project, but Matheos and Moore found they both had gaps in their schedules so produced a follow-up. Free was released in 2006, with Portnoy returning to play drums as a session musician rather than a full band member, due to personal and musical differences between him and Moore. Blood was released in 2009, with Porcupine Tree drummer Gavin Harrison replacing Portnoy. The fourth album Fire Make Thunder was released in 2012 by Metal Blade Records, with Harrison once again on drums."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"R.E.M. was an American rock band from Athens, Georgia, formed in 1980 by lead singer Michael Stipe, lead guitarist Peter Buck, bassist Mike Mills, and drummer Bill Berry. One of the first popular alternative rock bands, R.E.M. were noted for Buck's ringing, arpeggiated guitar style and Stipe's surreal vocal quality. R.E.M. released their first single, \"Radio Free Europe\", in 1981 on the independent record label Hib-Tone. The single was followed by the Chronic Town EP in 1982, the band's first release on I.R.S. Records. In 1983, the group released its critically acclaimed debut album, Murmur, and built its reputation over the next few years through subsequent releases, constant touring, and the support of college radio. Following years of underground success, R.E.M. achieved a mainstream hit in 1987 with the single \"The One I Love\". The group signed to Warner Bros. Records in 1988, and began to espouse political and environmental concerns while playing large arenas worldwide. By the early 1990s, when alternative rock began to experience broad mainstream success, R.E.M. was viewed by subsequent acts such as Nirvana and Pavement as a pioneer of the genre. The band then released its two most commercially successful albums, Out of Time (1991) and Automatic for the People (1992), which veered from the band's established sound and catapulted it to international fame. R.E.M.'s 1994 release, Monster, was a return to a more rock-oriented sound, but still continued its run of success. The band began its first tour in six years to support the album; the tour was marred by medical emergencies suffered by three band members. In 1996, R.E.M. re-signed with Warner Bros. for a reported US$80 million, at the time the most expensive recording contract in history. Its 1996 release, New Adventures in Hi-Fi, though critically acclaimed, fared worse commercially than expected. The following year, Bill Berry left the band, while Buck, Mills, and Stipe continued the group as a trio. Through some changes in musical style, the band continued its career into the next decade with mixed critical and commercial success, despite having sold more than 85 million records worldwide and becoming one of the world's best-selling music artists of all time. In 2007, the band was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. R.E.M. disbanded amicably in September 2011, announcing the split on its website."@en ;

It achieved international success throughout the 1980s and 1990s, playing a pivotal role in the surfacing, development and dissemination of Latin and Ibero-American rock.[citation needed] They were the first Latin rock group to achieve success throughout Hispanic America.[citation needed] Soda\u2019s early sound was influenced by new wave bands such as Virus, The Police, Elvis Costello and post-punk bands such as Television (this influence particularly demonstrated in Soda's early works, e.g. Soda Stereo (1984), Nada Personal (1985), Signos (1986), and Doble Vida (1988)). The band gradually evolved into a heavier sounding alternative rock band, eventually drawing influences from classic rock, progressive rock, shoegaze, neo-psychedelia, britpop, and electronic music, particularly with the albums Canci\u00F3n Animal (1990), Dynamo (1992), and Sue\u00F1o Stereo (1995). Soda Stereo has topped the all-time lists in their native Argentina, becoming one of the best-selling Argentinian bands of all time and setting landmarks in record sales and concert attendances. Throughout their 15-year career, the band sold over 17 million albums in Latin America alone \u2013 this number has since continued to rise following the separation of the band.[citation needed] After the band's separation, all three of its members found separate endeavours \u2013 Gustavo Cerati continued a successful solo career after the band's split, releasing four studio albums (most of which achieved Platinum and Gold status in Argentina; see his discography for more information), while Zeta Bosio worked for a time as bassist for several underground groups and is now touring as a DJ; Charly Alberti has also found moderate success, both with the foundation of his CybeRelations company, and his family band MOLE. In 2010, Gustavo Cerati suffered a massive stroke while on tour for his Fuerza natural album and fell into a coma, ultimately dying on September 4, 2014."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Survivor is an American rock band formed in Chicago in 1978 by Jim Peterik. The band achieved its greatest success in the 1980s, garnering many charting singles, especially in the United States. The band is best known for its double platinum-certified 1982 hit \"Eye of the Tiger,\" the theme song for the motion picture Rocky III (US number 1 for 6 weeks). Singles like \"Burning Heart\" (US number 2), \"The Search Is Over\" (US number 4), \"High on You\" (US number 8), \"Is This Love\" (US number 9) and \"I Can't Hold Back\" (US number 13) continued to chart in the mid-1980s. The band tweaked its musical direction in 1988 with the release of the slightly heavier Too Hot to Sleep, but due to lackluster promotion the album barely reached the Billboard 200 in the United States. Because of this and tension between founding members, the band split. Singer Jimi Jamison later toured as \"Survivor\" in the mid-1990s without the permission of the rest of the band, but reunited with Sullivan in 2000. The band then released Reach in 2006, but Jamison left again after its release and was replaced by singer Robin McAuley. Survivor continued to tour with McAuley into 2011 until Jamison returned later that year. An announcement on November 13, 2011 by McAuley on his Facebook page revealed that he had left Survivor. A subsequent announcement on November 18, 2011 confirmed that Jamison had rejoined the band and a tour was to take place in 2012. In April 2013 it was announced by the band's official media sources that guitarist Frankie Sullivan had reunited the current Survivor line-up with original singer Dave Bickler, with the band now having their two most popular vocalists together for the next tour, Bickler and Jamison. On September 1, 2014 Jamison died of what was believed to be a heart attack in his home in Memphis, TN. at the age of 63. His autopsy released on November 11, 2014 revealed the actual cause of death to be a hemorrhagic brain stroke, with \"acute methamphetamine intoxication contributing.\""@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"TVXQ (stylized as TVXQ!), an initialism for Tong Vfang Xien Qi (Chinese: \u6771\u65B9\u795E\u8D77), is a South Korean pop duo consisting of U-Know Yunho and Max Changmin. They are known as Tohoshinki (\u6771\u65B9\u795E\u8D77 T\u014Dh\u014Dshinki) in Japanese releases, and are sometimes referred to as DBSK, an abbreviation of their Korean name Dong Bang Shin Ki (Hangul: \uB3D9\uBC29\uC2E0\uAE30). Their name roughly translates to \"Rising Gods of the East\". Formed by S.M. Entertainment in 2003, TVXQ began as a five-member boy band composed of members U-Know Yunho, Max Changmin, Hero Jaejoong, Micky Yoochun, and Xiah Junsu. They were immediately launched to mainstream recognition following the release of their first physical single \"Hug\" (2004), which peaked at number four on the MIAK monthly music chart. Their first studio albums Tri-Angle (2004) and Rising Sun (2005) were both top sellers, pushing the band's popularity beyond Korea. Under Avex, TVXQ entered the Japanese market with their first Japanese album Heart, Mind and Soul (2006), but it was met with limited success. TVXQ rose to international prominence in the late 2000s, after the group achieved critical acclaim in the Korean music industry for their best-selling albums \"O\"-Jung.Ban.Hap. (2006) and Mirotic (2008), both winning the Golden Disk Award for Album of the Year. The latter album also contains the pop hit \"Mirotic,\" touted by international music critics as a staple song of K-pop. With four chart-topping singles, TVXQ gained widespread media attention in Japan following the release of their fourth Japanese album The Secret Code (2009). However, despite their commercial success, the group plunged into legal turmoil and internal conflict when members Jaejoong, Yoochun, and Junsu attempted to split from their Korean agency S.M. Entertainment. Prior to the trio's departure in 2010, TVXQ released their last Japanese album as a quintet Best Selection 2010, which became the group's first album to top the Oricon Albums Chart. The album spawned two platinum-selling singles, including the long-running hit \"Share the World / We Are!\" After a year-long hiatus, TVXQ returned as a duo with remaining members Yunho and Changmin. They released TVXQ's fifth Korean album Keep Your Head Down (2011), topping album charts in most major Asian markets upon release. Their first two Japanese albums as a duo, Tone (2011) and Time (2013), solidified their success in Japan as it forged TVXQ's reputation as one of the top-touring artists in the country. Their eighth Japanese album With (2014) made TVXQ the first and only foreign music act in Japan to have four number-one albums in a row. Selling over 10 million albums in the first 10 years of their career, TVXQ have become one of Asia's most successful music acts of their generation. TVXQ's album sales have amassed over 14 million copies until 2015. They are often referred to as \"Asia's Stars\" and the \"Kings of K-pop\" for their immense success and contributions to the Hallyu. According to the Oricon, TVXQ have the most number-one singles for a foreign artist, and is Japan's best-selling foreign music act in CD singles of all time. Their Time Tour, one of the highest-grossing concert tours of 2013, is the highest-attended concert tour held by a foreign music act in Japan. With the tour, the duo became the first non-Japanese Asian artists to headline a nationwide five-Dome tour, and were the first foreign artists to perform in the Nissan Stadium. Billboard has described the group as \"K-pop royalty\"."@en ;

The group signed a contract that was the highest ever for a new music act at the time. Two studio albums, The Babys and Broken Heart went without incident and were well received. However, when recording Head First in August 1978, Michael Corby was replaced by Jonathan Cain as keyboardist and Ricky Phillips took over as bassist. From 1979 until the breakup in 1981, The Babys line-up consisted of vocalist Waite, drummer Brock, bassist Phillips, guitarist Stocker, and keyboardist Cain. John Waite went on to produce a major solo hit, \"Missing You\", in 1984. Stocker and Brock worked with Rod Stewart and other mainstream artists including Elton John and Air Supply. Cain left to join Journey. Waite, Cain and Phillips joined Bad English in the late 1980s. Phillips currently plays for Styx. In 2013 it was announced that Brock and Stocker had reformed the band, alongside vocalist/bassist John Bisaha and guitarist Joey Sykes.

The band originated in Boston, Massachusetts in 1976, with singer, rhythm guitarist and songwriter Ric Ocasek, singer and bassist Benjamin Orr, lead guitarist Elliot Easton, keyboardist Greg Hawkes and drummer David Robinson. The Cars were at the forefront in merging 1970s guitar-oriented rock with the new synthesizer-oriented pop that was then becoming popular and which would flourish in the early 1980s. Robert Palmer, music critic for The New York Times and Rolling Stone, described the Cars' musical style by saying: \"they have taken some important but disparate contemporary trends\u2014punk minimalism, the labyrinthine synthesizer and guitar textures of art rock, the '50s rockabilly revival and the melodious terseness of power pop\u2014and mixed them into a personal and appealing blend.\" The Cars were named \"Best New Artist\" in the 1978 Rolling Stone Readers' Poll and won \"Video of the Year\" for \"You Might Think\" at the first MTV Video Music Awards in 1984. Their debut album, The Cars, sold six million copies and appeared on the Billboard 200 album chart for 139 weeks. As of 2001, the Cars have sold over 23 million albums in the United States. The band broke up in 1988, and Ocasek had always discouraged talk of a reunion since then. Orr died in 2000 from pancreatic cancer. In 2005, Easton and Hawkes joined with Todd Rundgren to form a spin-off band, the New Cars, which performed classic Cars and Rundgren songs alongside new material. The original members reunited in 2010 to record a new album, Move Like This, which was released in May 2011, followed by a short tour.

	dbo:abstract	"The Enemy were a punk rock band from Dunedin, New Zealand, that are often seen as the starting point of the Dunedin Sound rock movement. Formed early 1977 and fronted by vocalist Chris Knox with bassist Mick Dawson, drummer Mike Dooley, and guitarist Alec Bathgate, the band were strongly influenced by artists similar to those cited by the then-ascendant international punk rock music scene. Elements of Glam rock, hard rock and the catchy chart-pop music of the 1960s were fused with definitive pre-punk acts like Lou Reed and Iggy Pop (who is referred to in the song \"Iggy Told Me\", during the performance of which Knox would often intentionally cut himself, drawing blood). During the last months of 1978, bassist Mike Dooley left to return to Dunedin and former Split Enz member Phil Judd joined the band, but the lineup proved incompatible. Due to these and other tensions (the 'punk' label was becoming something of a burden), the Enemy ceased soon after. Though the band did not release any official recordings, some of their performances and their few-but-extensive studio recordings (their entire 20-song repertoire was recorded in Auckland, October 1978 just before their November split) are available in bootleg form. With a solid 'originals-only' performance regime, the Enemy are seen as hugely influential on the development of New Zealand's indigenous rock music culture. Though the band only existed from 1977 to 1978, they created a distinct, idiosyncratic style and popularised a 'original music is crucial' attitude which helped facilitate the development of several local music scenes in both Dunedin and New Zealand in general. Upon the demise of The Enemy, Bathgate, Dooley and Knox went on to form the highly successful Toy Love. Toy Love played a number of songs that The Enemy had originally performed, though usually with some musical rearrangement or alteration of the sometimes-pungent lyrics. Songs that began with The Enemy but were subsequently utilised by Toy Love include \"Swimming Pool\", \"I Don't Mind\", \"1978\", \"Squeeze\", \"Sheep\", \"Cold Meat\", \"I'm Not Bored\" (which The Enemy introduced as \"I'm Not Bored, I'm Dead\"), and \"Don't Catch Fire\". After Toy Love broke up in October 1980, Bathgate and Knox remained together as Tall Dwarfs. Early supporters of The Enemy included Dunedin brothers Hamish and David Kilgour, founders of The Clean. Legend has it that Hamish Kilgour named The Enemy for their music style, and in response or retaliation, Knox commented that the Kilgours' own sound was \"squeaky clean\", hence that band's name."@en ;

After Kamal left the act in 2000, The Jerky Boys continued on as a solo act featuring only Brennan, before going on hiatus after the 2001 release of their final album, The Jerky Tapes. The calls were made by ringing up unsuspecting recipients, or in response to classified advertisements placed in local New York-based newspapers. Each call was made in character, usually with over the top voices influenced by the duo's family members. According to their current record label, Laugh.com, the act has sold over 8,000,000 CDs since their 1993 debut. On February 25, 2014, Rolling Stone published an article on The Jerky Boys, in which Johnny Brennan made several prank calls."@en ;

dbr:The_Magic_Lanterns	rdf:type	dbo:Band ;
	dbo:abstract	"The Magic Lanterns were an English pop rock group formed in Warrington, Lancashire. They formed in 1962 as The Sabres, playing locally in Manchester and changing their name a few years later. They signed to CBS Records after releasing the single, \"Excuse Me Baby\", which charted at #44 in the UK in 1966, and a few singles later they put out an album, Lit Up. In 1968 they switched to Atlantic Records and released their first US hit, \"Shame, Shame\", which hit #29 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart and peaked on #3 on Canada's RPM Charts. \"Shame Shame\" was also released in the UK, on the short lived 'Camp' record label, as was \"Melt All Your Troubles Away\" the following year, but neither enjoyed any chart success. The single \"Give Me Love\" followed, as did a Stateside album. Changing record labels again in 1970 to Big Tree Records, a second album followed, but it would be their last. They had two more minor hits in the US, \"One Night Stand\" (#74, 1971) and \"Country Woman\" (#88, 1972), but in early 1970, lead singer-songwriter Jimmy Bilsbury quit the group to co-found the Les Humphries Singers with bandleader/songwriter Les Humphries. Most of the other members left soon after Bilsbury's departure for careers in other fields. Songwriter Albert Hammond, however, went on to further renown, and bassist \"Oz\" Osborne would spend several decades fighting the mistaken impression that Ozzy Osbourne had actually played in his early career with the Lanterns. In 1972, the band released further singles on Polydor label in the UK, neither of which met with chart success."@en ;

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/The_Quick_(UK_band)>	rdf:type	dbo:Band ;
	dbo:abstract	"The Quick was a dance pop duo from England that consisted of vocalist Colin \"Col\" Campsie and bassist/keyboardist George McFarlane. Their greatest success in the US came in 1981 when their song \"Zulu\" spent two weeks at No. 1 on the US Hot Dance Music/Club Play chart. McFarlane and Campsie originally met in California in 1978 and began working together when they returned to England, teaming up with guitarist/keyboardist Ivan Penfold and drummer Graham Broad. Augmented by guitarists Rob Greene and Danny McIntosh Jr. the band christened themselves Grand Hotel and in early 1979 released one album for CBS UK under the title of Do Not Disturb. Later that year Campsie and McFarlane resurfaced as The Quick. Their debut single, \"Sharks Are Cool, Jets Are Hot\" was released on CBS affiliate Epic Records in 1979. In 1981 the duo's single \"Hip Shake Jerk\" became a hit in Australia, reaching No. 12, and their first album On the Uptake was quickly released there. Remixed and repackaged as One Light in a Blackout (in Canada) and Fascinating Rhythm (in Europe) the album was released to the rest of the world in 1982, scoring a U.S. dance hit with \"Zulu\". The single \"Rhythm of the Jungle\" was another Top 20 success in Australia, reaching No. 13, and also became a hit in Europe. Stylistically this inaugural period for the band was characterized by a hybrid of popular funk, dance, and new wave influences with an emphasis on bass and keyboards. By the early 1980s, McFarlane and Campsie had also started doing studio work for other musicians, producing an album for Endgames among others. The Quick's second album, International Thing, released by Epic in 1984, showed the band moving away from their earlier dance-friendly roots and adopting a more mainstream AOR approach and incorporating a variety of styles that expanded their previous boundaries to include a harder-edged rock sound. During this period Campsie and McFarlane maintained a close friendship and professional alliance with British duo Go West. The Quick's final album, Wah Wah, released in 1986 on A&M Records, was produced by The Cure bassist Phil Thornalley and saw the band moving sonically in an even heavier rock direction while still maintaining melodic pop sensibilities. Under Thornalley's direction, \"Wah Wah\" features dense 'wall of sound' production and heavy processing of instrumentation akin to that heard on the Trevor Horn-produced '90125' album by Yes (1984). McFarlane and Campsie returned to Los Angeles for their next project, teaming up with producer Gardner Cole, resurfacing as Giant Steps in 1988 and releasing their sole album The Book of Pride through A&M. Book of Pride found Campsie and McFarlane returning to their dance/funk roots but with an updated rhythmic sense and keyboard-dominated sound displaying the influences of artists such as Prince, Morris Day & The Time, and Ready for the World. Working with R&B producer Preston Glass, Campsie and McFarlane recorded three new Giant Steps songs in 1989; ballad 'Lonely 4 U', 'Paint the Town Blue', and the uptempo 'What We're Made Of' (featuring Larry Graham guesting on bass and vocals) were slated for a second Giant Steps album which never materialized. From 1990 to 2010, Colin Campsie was married to British vocalist Beverley Craven. Through his London-based company Song-Creator, George McFarlane continues to be active as a songwriter, music producer, programmer, arranger and songwriting consultant, and has written music for television shows including CSI NY, The Late Show with David Letterman, Two and a Half Men, Sex and the City, American Idol, Good Morning America, and The Oprah Winfrey Show, among others."@en ;

Jay Farrar, Jeff Tweedy, and Mike Heidorn formed the band after the lead singer of their previous band, The Primitives, left to attend college. The trio recorded three albums for Rockville Records, before signing with Sire Records and expanding to a five-piece. Shortly after the release of the band's major label debut album Anodyne, Farrar announced his decision to leave the band owing to a soured relationship with his co-songwriter Tweedy. Uncle Tupelo split on May 1, 1994, after completing a farewell tour. Following the breakup, Farrar formed Son Volt with Heidorn, while the remaining members continued as Wilco. Although Uncle Tupelo broke up before it achieved commercial success, the band is renowned for its impact on the alternative country music scene. The group's first album, No Depression, became a byword for the genre and was widely influential. Uncle Tupelo's sound was unlike popular country music of the time, drawing inspiration from styles as diverse as the hardcore punk of The Minutemen and the country instrumentation and harmony of the Carter Family and Hank Williams. Farrar and Tweedy's lyrics frequently referred to Middle America and the working class of Belleville."@en ;

Although it was not the first Soviet band to play heavy music, Aria was the first to break through to mainstream media and commercial success.[citation needed] According to several public polls, Aria ranks among top 10 most popular Russian rock bands. Their sound resembled that of NWOBHM bands, for which they were dubbed the \"Russian Iron Maiden\" in the media.

Aria is the root of so-called \"Aria Family\": several bands formed by its former members.

Vocalist Valery Kipelov, who was the main voice of the band for the majority of albums they have released, departed in 2002 and formed his own heavy-metal band Kipelov.

	dbo:abstract	"Diante do Trono ([dj\u0250\u0303.t\u0268 du t\u027Eonu]; lit.: Before the Throne) is a Brazilian contemporary Christian music band formed in 1997 in the city of Belo Horizonte, in the Lagoinha Baptist Church. It is led by singer, songwriter and pastor Ana Paula Valad\u00E3o. The group became popular in Brazil after the release of their first work, the disc Diante do Trono 1998. However, it was the albums \u00C1guas Purificadoras and Preciso de Ti that gained them international recognition, turning them into the main worship ministry in Latin America and one of the most successful in Brazilian music. In one presentation, held in 2003 during the recording of the album Quero Me Apaixonar, Diante do Trono gathered about 2 million people. The band has won trophies for Talent and Promise, and was also nominated for a Latin Grammy in 2012 with the Sol da Justi\u00E7a work. Diante do Trono has sold over 15 million records in various formats, one of the record holders of record sales in Brazil. The band, from its inception had a brass orchestra and strings, has had several instrumental changes throughout its career, especially the period of the years 2008 and 2010, when the only members that remained from the initial training group were Ana Paula Valad\u00E3o, vocalist and band leader, and Elias Fernandes, rhythm guitarist of the set. With the end of the orchestra the band's sound became noticeably more pop rock. The band's music is characterized by congregational singing and contemporary Christian music, with influences of pop rock, progressive rock and folk. The band had also created the Center for Ministerial Training Diante do Trono (CTMDT), a preparatory center for musicians and singers in the area of missions, as well as the Arts Factory, which in a partnership with the Lagoinha Baptist Church trains professionals in diverse areas such as singing, theater and dance, and has part of his discography devoted entirely to children. Diante do Trono participates in social projects, such as India Project, which collects and help Indian girls in prostitution, food donations to cities in the North of Minas Gerais in 2003, and a campaign of bone marrow donations in Barretos, during the recording of their thirteenth album in 2010."@en ;

dbr:Dødheimsgard	rdf:type	dbo:Band ;
	dbo:abstract	"D\u00F8dheimsgard (also known as DHG) is a Norwegian extreme metal band formed in 1994. D\u00F8dheimsgard was originally a black metal band, but 1999's 666 International saw them change into an experimental and avant-garde / industrial metal band. In 2000, they shortened their name to DHG. During 2003, they went through some lineup changes, replacing Aldrahn, Zweizz and Czral. \"D\u00F8dheimsgard\" is a contraction of three words: D\u00F8d which means 'death', heim which means 'home' and gard which means (at least in this context) 'realm'. A natural translation into English would be \"Realm of Death\". In 2006, they completed the new album Supervillain Outcast, which was released in April 2007 by Moonfog Productions and The End Records. On January 4, 2008, it was announced that vocalist Kvohst had left the band. However, as of October 2010, he has rejoined D\u00F8dheimsgard, Also in 2010 a new drummer, Terghl, and a new guitarist, Blargh, was introduced. The band released their fifth studio album, A Umbra Omega, on March 16, 2015."@en ;

dbr:Invasionen	rdf:type	dbo:Band ;
	dbo:abstract	"INVSN (formerly Invasionen and before that The Lost Patrol Band) is the music project of Swedish Punk rock musician Dennis Lyxz\u00E9n. In contrast to his other projects, Refused and The (International) Noise Conspiracy, this started out as a solo career and much more folkish and softer than his prior music endeavors. The band was previously called the Lost Patrol Band; however, the name was changed because the American group, The Lost Patrol holds the North American trademark on the name. As the name changed, the band started to write music in Swedish. In 1999, Lyxz\u00E9n put together a release titled \"Songs in the Key of Resistance\" which was written in the political vein that Lyxz\u00E9n's fans best know him for. The album received mixed reactions. Critics often blasted the album for straying from its creator's punk roots, while others were impressed by Lyxz\u00E9n's ability to diversify his musical output. The Lost Patrol returned in 2003 with \"Songs about Running Away\". According to Lyxz\u00E9n, the album had been supposed to be just as subversive and political as his previous album, yet due to relationship problems, it ended up being an emotional outburst. Guests such as David Sandstr\u00F6m (Refused), Stefan Granberg (Randy) and Lisa Miskovsky helped to make this album one of Lyxz\u00E9n's most experimental. In 2005, Burning Heart Records reported that The Lost Patrol has grown from Lyxz\u00E9n's solo project into a full-fledged band. This is reflected in the title of the 2005 album The Lost Patrol Band. The album also represents a further change in style, this time encompassing the upbeat sounds of 1970s/'80s punk and power pop. In 2013 the group signed to Razor & Tie and changed their name to INVSN."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Panic! at the Disco (stylized for a time as Panic at the Disco) is an American rock band from Las Vegas, Nevada, formed in 2004 and featuring the current lineup of vocalist Brendon Urie, accompanied on tour by bassist Dallon Weekes, guitarist Kenneth Harris, and drummer Dan Pawlovich. Founded by childhood friends Ryan Ross, Spencer Smith, Brent Wilson and Brendon Urie, Panic! at the Disco recorded its first demos while its members were in high school. Shortly after, the band recorded and released its debut studio album, A Fever You Can't Sweat Out (2005). Made known by the top ten lead single, \"I Write Sins Not Tragedies\", the album eventually was certified double platinum in the US. In 2006, founding bassist Brent Wilson was fired from the band during an extensive world tour, and subsequently replaced by Jon Walker. Influenced by 1960s rock bands the Beatles, the Zombies and the Beach Boys, and preceded by the hit single, \"Nine in the Afternoon\", the band's second studio album, Pretty. Odd. (2008), marked a significant departure from the sound of the band's debut, and ultimately led to the departure of guitarist and principal songwriter Ryan Ross and bassist Jon Walker, who favored the band's new direction. The duo subsequently formed a new band, the Young Veins, leaving Brendon Urie and Spencer Smith as the sole remaining members of Panic! at the Disco. Continuing as a duo, Urie and Smith released a new single, \"New Perspective\", and recruited Dallon Weekes as their bassist and Ian Crawford as their lead guitarist to accompany the band during live performances. Weekes was later inducted into the band's lineup as a full-time member in 2010, nearing the end of the recording of the band's third studio album, Vices & Virtues (2011). The album marked a return to the band's initial Vaudevillian pop punk sound and was recorded solely by Urie and Spencer with producers John Feldmann and Butch Walker. Currently as a three-piece, Urie, Smith, and Weekes recorded and released the band's fourth studio album, Too Weird to Live, Too Rare to Die!, in 2013. In 2015, founding member Spencer Smith officially left the band. Bassist Dallon Weekes was also downgraded to a touring member once again, leaving Brendon Urie as the only member of the official lineup. On April 20, 2015, the band released \"Hallelujah\" as the first single from their fifth studio album. The fifth album Death of a Bachelor was released worldwide on January 15, 2016."@en ;

The Bear Quartet are Mattias Alkberg on vocals and guitar, Jari Haapalainen on guitar, Peter Nuottaniemi on bass guitar, Jejo Perkovic on drums and Carl Olsson on keyboards. Peter and Mattias write the lyrics, while Mattias, Jari and Carl write the music. The Bear Quartet have spawned many side projects. Mattias sings and plays in Mattias Alkberg BD, whose debut album Tunaskolan released in 2004 was very well received by the critics and audience. Their music can be described as classic punk/new wave in Swedish, with influences such as Tant Strul and Imperiet, both of which they have recorded cover songs of. Jari produces lots of other artists, such as Nicolai Dunger, Ed Harcourt, Camera Obscura, Kristofer \u00C5str\u00F6m, The Concretes and Frida Hyv\u00F6nen, and used to play with Maria from The Concretes in Heikki. Carl has Paddington DC, some kind of noise electro pop. The name The Bear Quartet is taken from Klas \u00D6stergren's novel Gentlemen. The album titles follow an interesting naming scheme: every title is two words, of which the first ends with a \"y\".

They were formed in 1997 and have been active ever since. Their only hiatus was during the Van Halen tour of 2004, during which Hagar kept them fully paid. They include Sammy Hagar's former Justice Brothers bandmate drummer David Lauser, who played on several of Sammy Hagar's solo albums in the eighties before he left for Van Halen and the more recent formation of The Waboritas. The band also once included keyboardist Jesse Harms, known for appearances on several of Sammy Hagar's previous solo albums as well. For a mid-2000s live tour after Jesse Harms' departure, the band also included percussionist Gibby Ross, who had also done some studio work on the Livin' It Up! album. Though not a member of the band, former Van Halen bassist Michael Anthony (who was with the band from 1974\u20132002, and again from 2003\u20132005) has made frequent guest appearances with the Wabos. Wabo member Vic Johnson is now part of the Mad Anthony Xpress, Michael Anthony's new band. Sammy Hagar, David Lauser, and Michael Anthony also comprise the harmony-singing rock band Los Tres Gusanos, with whom Vic Johnson often performs as a guest. Hagar's most recent album, Cosmic Universal Fashion, is a solo album and not a Waboritas album; this is his first since he began using The Waboritas as a backing band and thus unusual; as on Hagar's last four studio albums he has played with The Wabos on disc and credited the album to both of them. However, the Waboritas are still the main musicians on most of the album's tracks with guest appearances similar to the Marching to Mars format."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"TrinityRoots (1998\u20132005, 2011\u2013present) are a band based in Wellington, New Zealand. Although they are commonly associated with New Zealand reggae they also embody a stripped back, jazz and soul-influenced rhythmic sound, which often builds up to highly emotional drum- and guitar-led crescendos. Like their contemporaries Fat Freddy's Drop, TrinityRoots formed a loyal fan base through live performances and word of mouth. They played alongside international acts including Ben Harper, Lee Scratch Perry, The Mad Professor, as well as local bands such as Fat Freddys Drop, Salmonella Dub and Che Fu. TrinityRoots has also toured small towns on sellout tours. The band's song \"Little Things\" was featured prominently in an episode of the cartoon bro'Town. Before breaking up in 2005, the band released a self-titled EP and two albums, True and Home, Land and Sea. Both albums reached Platinum status in New Zealand with virtually no advertising or media attention. The band separated in 2005, playing their final concert in February 2005 in a sellout concert to raise relief funds for the Boxing Day Tsunami at the Wellington Town Hall. This material was released in 2010 with accompanying documentary footage as Music Is Choice. All members of the band, past and present, are involved in other musical projects and continued making music after the 2005 break-up. Lead singer and guitarist Warren Maxwell was a member of Fat Freddy's Drop until late 2006 when he left to spend more time with family, and is the frontman of the acclaimed group Little Bushman . Bassist Rio Hemopo has released solo music and is involved with Breaks Co-op as a member of their live band. Drummer Riki Gooch has also released solo music under his own name and as Eru Dangerspiel, as well as playing and producing for many other artists and projects such as Neil Finn, Hollie Smith and Ria Hall. In early September 2010, Trinity Roots announced they had re-formed and embarked on a tour of New Zealand. In July 2011, the band announced that Riki Gooch was leaving. Wellington-based drummer Jean Pompey has replaced him. Gooch had previously left the band after the recording of their first EP, and was replaced by Darren Mathiassen. Gooch returned to the band during the time that True was being recorded, hence both Mathiassen and Gooch featuring in the album sleeve notes. The song \"D by D\" was written by Mathiassen."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Army of Anyone was a rock supergroup formed by Filter frontman Richard Patrick with two members of rock band Stone Temple Pilots. In addition to Patrick on vocals, the band featured brothers Dean DeLeo and Robert DeLeo on guitar and bass respectively, and Ray Luzier, formerly of David Lee Roth's band, on drums. The band released one self-titled album in November 2006, which was well-received, but sold well short of the member's multi-platinum selling releases of their other bands. After touring in support of the album, the band went into hiatus in mid-2007, with members returning to their respective bands, except Luzier, who joined Korn. Despite this, members have stated that they are still in contact with one another, and have alluded to the possibility of a second album if everyone were able to work around their respective schedules."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Guns N' Roses is an American hard rock band from Los Angeles formed in 1985. The classic lineup, as signed to Geffen Records in 1986, consisted of vocalist Axl Rose, lead guitarist Slash, rhythm guitarist Izzy Stradlin, bassist Duff McKagan, and drummer Steven Adler. The current lineup consists of Rose, Slash, McKagan, keyboardist Dizzy Reed, guitarist Richard Fortus, drummer Frank Ferrer and keyboardist Chris Pitman. The band has released six studio albums, accumulating sales of more than 100 million records worldwide, including shipments of 45 million in the United States, making Guns N' Roses one of the world's best-selling bands of all time. Guns N' Roses' debut album, Appetite for Destruction (1987), reached number one on the Billboard 200 a year after its release, on the strength of \"Sweet Child o' Mine\", the group's only single to reach number one on the Billboard Hot 100. The album has sold approximately 30 million copies worldwide, including 18 million units in the United States, making it the best-selling debut album of all time in the US, as well as the eleventh best-selling album in the United States. The success of the debut was followed by the eight-song album G N' R Lies (1988) which reached number two on the Billboard 200. The twin albums Use Your Illusion I and Use Your Illusion II (1991) debuted at number two and number one on the Billboard 200 and have sold a combined 35 million copies worldwide, including 14 million units in the United States. The cover album \"The Spaghetti Incident?\" (1993) was the band's last studio album to feature Slash and McKagan. After more than a decade of work and several lineup changes, Guns N' Roses released the long-awaited album Chinese Democracy (2008) which, at an estimated $14 million in production costs, is the most expensive rock album to ever be produced in music history. It debuted at number three on the Billboard 200 but undersold industry expectations, despite mostly positive critical reception. Classic era members Slash and McKagan both rejoined the band in 2016. Guns N' Roses has been credited with reviving the mainstream popularity of rock music, at a time when popular music was dominated by dance music and glam metal. Its late 1980s and early 1990s years have been described as the period in which they brought forth a \"hedonistic rebelliousness\" reminiscent of the early Rolling Stones, a reputation that had earned them the nickname \"the most dangerous band in the world\". The band's classic lineup, along with later members Reed and drummer Matt Sorum, was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2012, in its first year of eligibility."@en ;

The group was founded in 1989 through the assistance of record producer Tony Brown. McBride & the Ride's first three albums \u2014 Burnin' Up the Road, the gold-certified Sacred Ground, and Hurry Sundown, released in 1991, 1992, and 1993, respectively \u2014 were all issued on MCA Nashville.

In 1994, the label removed Herndon and Thomas from the group, which was renamed Terry McBride & the Ride. McBride remained lead singer, while the other members were replaced with Keith Edwards (drums), Kenny Vaughan (electric guitar), Gary Morse (steel guitar), Jeff Roach (keyboards), and Randy Frazier (bass guitar), who had formerly been a member of the band Palomino Road. Roach and Vaughan were respectively replaced by Rick Gerken and Bob Britt shortly before their fourth album (1994's Terry McBride & the Ride), after which McBride & the Ride disbanded.

McBride, Thomas, and Herndon reunited as McBride & the Ride in 2000, releasing Amarillo Sky on Dualtone Records in 2002 before splitting up again.

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Neck_(band)>	rdf:type	dbo:Band ;
	dbo:abstract	"Neck is a six-piece London-Irish Celtic punk band from the North London neighbourhood of 'County Holloway' (known informally thus due to its Irish population). Following Leeson O'Keeffe's cathartic 'Tour of Duty' as a former member of Shane MacGowan and the Popes, Neck were formed during late-night drinking sessions (known colloquially as being 'Born in a bottle') in 1994 by a mixture of Irish emigrant & second-generation Irish drinking buddies. The band takes their lead, both musically and ideologically, from two other London bands: The Clash and The Pogues, blending the electric energy of punk rock with the swirl of traditional Irish music, to play a London-Irish style known as 'Psycho-Ceil\u00EDdh'. Initially playing exclusively on the London Irish bar circuit, apparently mainly for more hedonistic reasons, and with a correspondingly 'cavalier' attitude towards required band possessions, their name was serendipitously gleaned from the reaction to their approach by the exasperated landlord at their first ever gig, cursing them with an old Irish saying using the term \"neck\" - implying high levels of nerve or impudence. They would appeared to have branched-out considerably, both aspirationally and geographically, since then: touring extensively throughout the United States, Europe, UK and Ireland; gaining a reputation as a raucous, high energy live act, leading to them becoming an established festival band. Such festivals include: Tantsy festival in Moscow Hermitage Garden; Dublin Irish Festival, OH - the second largest Irish festival in the USA; Paas Pop in The Netherlands; The West Belfast F\u00E9ile an Phobail; Berlin's Punk & Disorderly festival four times; the UK's largest festival, Glastonbury festival, six times; and the UK's Wasted/Rebellion Punk festival ten times! Their music is known for having an uplifting quality, and it reflects the life experience of the emigrant and second-generation Irish diaspora, with O'Keeffe's authentic voice and song-and-tune-writing being considered both faithful to the form, and in direct lineage from his former band-leader and mentor, Shane MacGowan. Combined with deft musicianship, Neck have released four albums to date, with their third album, 'Sod 'em & begorrah!' being picked out for particularly high praise by being judged, variously, the second and third greatest Celtic Punk album of all time, the former above, and the latter behind only The Pogues and Flogging Molly. They've also appeared on numerous Compilation albums, and their natural London inclusiveness and Punk sensibilities came well to the fore on their Joe Strummer (of The Clash) -inspired anti-racism anthem \"Everybody's Welcome to The Hooley!\", which charted in the UK Singles Chart and UK Indie Chart in 2006. Their music can also be heard on various Motion Picture soundtracks: on the \"surreal\" Pirates of the White Sand short (2005); The Emerald Diamond, a 2006 documentary film about the Irish National Baseball Team - contributing four songs, including the traditional \"Star of the County Down\" and the original \"Every Day's Saint Patrick's Day\"; the Boston-set Gang War Shoot-'em Up Beantown (2007); and the \"Capraesque\" homage to 'Small Town America Coming of Age' Supermarket (2009). They also appear performing two songs, the traditional \"Carrickfergus\" and the original \"The Ferry Fare\", in the 1999, Belfast-set, Film 4 Romantic Comedy Drama With or Without You, directed by Michael Winterbottom (Family / Welcome to Sarajevo / 24 Hour Party People). With over half their members drawn from the renowned London Irish traditional music session scene, their authentic, spirited musicianship has earned them much respect and admiration. Staying true to those roots, they often perform acoustic 'Unplugged / Irish traditional music session' sets, even alongside full electric ones, and such is their flair, energy and passion - exemplified by O'Keeffe's 'wearing his heart on his sleeve', that they were awarded the honour by the Irish Cultural Centre in London to perform such a Seisi\u00FAn at the Reception for the Irish Paralympic team in London 2012, in order to set the right Irish tone and ambience to the proceedings. This reputation has led to various members being invited to appear both live and on other band's recordings. The most well known being O'Keeffe guesting, on banjo, with the Alabama 3, as well as co-writing an original song \"That's It, I Quit\" on the Hayseed Dixie album No Covers. This has all led to them being recognised widely as one of the leading bands on the international Celtic punk and Folk Punk scenes, alongside their US contemporaries Dropkick Murphys and Flogging Molly, and such is their influence that not only is the Boston, Massachusetts-based website covering the Celtic Punk scene, Shite 'n' Onions, named after one of their tunes, but bands as far flung as in Germany and the USA now cover their songs, while O'Keeffe even gets name-checked in songs by other bands."@en ;

Signed to Mercury Nashville Records in 2004, Sugarland broke through that year with the release of their debut single \"Baby Girl\", the first single from their multi-platinum debut album Twice the Speed of Life. Hall left in 2006 before the group released its second album, Enjoy the Ride. This album produced their first two No. 1 singles (in the U.S.), \"Want To\" and \"Settlin'\", and won the duo a Grammy for \"Stay\". In 2008 they released their third album, titled Love on the Inside. This album produced three more No. 1 singles with \"All I Want to Do\", \"Already Gone\", and \"It Happens\".

	dbo:abstract	"Tuxedomoon is an experimental, post-punk, new wave band from San Francisco, California, United States. The band formed in the late 1970s at the beginning of the punk rock movement. Pulling influence from punk and electronic music, the group, originally consisting of Steven Brown and Blaine L. Reininger, used electronic violins, guitars, screaming vocals and synthesizers to develop a unique \"cabaret no-wave\" sound. Bassist Peter Principle joined the band and in 1979 they released the single \"No Tears\", which remains a post-punk cult classic. That year they signed to Ralph Records and released their first album, Half-Mute. Eventually Tuxedomoon relocated to Europe. The band separated in the early 1990s, only to reunite later that decade. They have remained together since releasing the album Cabin in the Sky in 2004."@en ;

They began playing together as Nonexist in 2000; in May 2002, they released their debut album, Deus Deceptor, on New Hawen Records in Europe and Century Media in North America. The group attempted to put together a touring lineup in 2002, but this never occurred, in part due to the group members' commitment to other projects. In 2003 Liiva and Modin split from the group, leaving Reinholdz the primary (and only) member. In 2004 Liiva (now with Hearse) confirmed the group's demise. In 2011 Nonexist was resurrected as Reinholdz started writing the second album \"From My Cold Dead Hands\". It was then recorded in 2011/2012 with Johan Liiva back on vocals, and released by Pivotal Rockordings in November 2012 and by Japanese label Trooper Entertainment in May 2013. This album was the debut as a producer for Reinholdz, doing all the mixing, producing and mastering himself. The band made their live-debut at the Scorched Tundra Festival in Gothenburg, December 2012. In 2014 Nonexist started recording album number three entitled Throne of Scars. It features nine tracks and is produced and mixed by Johan Reinholdz at Multipass Studios with the assistance of Markus Nilsson at Sunnan\u00E5 Studio in Malm\u00F6. The style of the songs retain the atmosphere from the previous album; dark, intense, varied and heavy while also adding some new influences in the mix. \"Throne of Scars\" was mixed and ready in April 2015 and during the same time the band signed a deal with Danish label Mighty Music. The album was released in Japan by Trooper Entertainment, in August and in the rest of the world by Mighty Music on October 10, 2015. In November 2015 Johan Liiva quit the band and Reinholdz took over the frontman-duties doing both guitar and vocals in the studio and also live - where the band now is active with Faithful Darkness-members Johan Aldg\u00E5rd and Joakim Strandberg Nilsson as well as Andromeda-bassplayer Linus Abrhamson completing the line-up.

The group comprised singers Nadine Coyle, Cheryl Fernandez-Versini, Sarah Harding, Nicola Roberts and Kimberley Walsh. The group achieved a string of twenty consecutive top ten singles in the United Kingdom, including four number ones. They also achieved seven certified albums, of which two reached number one. They have been nominated for five Brit Awards, winning the 2009 Best Single for \"The Promise\". The group's musical style was pop, but throughout their career they had experimented with electropop and dance-pop. Girls Aloud's collaborations with Brian Higgins and his songwriting and production team Xenomania earned the group critical acclaim, due to an innovative approach to mainstream pop music. The group became one of the few UK reality television acts to achieve continued success, amassing a fortune of \u00A330 million by May 2010. Guinness World Records lists them as \"Most Successful Reality TV Group\" in the 2007 edition. They also hold the record for \"Most Consecutive Top Ten Entries in the UK by a Female Group\" in the 2008 edition, and are credited again for \"Most Successful Reality TV Group\" in the 2011 edition. The group was also named the United Kingdom's biggest selling girl group of the 21st century, with over 4.3 million singles sales and 4 million albums sold in the UK alone.

Their sound mixed a generally punk rock approach to vocals and sound textures with poppy tunes and strong musicianship. Although these three band members remained fairly constant, they went through numerous drummers, including Duff McKagan, later of Guns N' Roses. MTV's web page on the Fastbacks says that estimates at the number of Fastbacks drummers \"range from 12 to 20.\" For most of the band's last decade, Mike Musburger filled this role, but other Fastbacks drummers before him (or when he took occasional breaks) included Bloch himself, Richard Stuverud (perhaps best known from War Babies, Fifth Angel and Three Fish, side project of Pearl Jam's Jeff Ament), Nate Johnson and Rusty Willoughby (both of whom also played in both Flop and Pure Joy), John Moen (of the Dharma Bums, later of Steven Malkmus's Jicks and The Decemberists), Jason Finn (of the Presidents of the United States of America), Dan Peters of Mudhoney, and Tad Hutchison of the Young Fresh Fellows. Several of these people also served at times as drummers in The Squirrels, a similarly long-lived band, and the Fastbacks' sometime label-mates on PopLlama Records, who bring a similar mix of strong musicianship and punk attitude to even poppier material. Contributing to the band's breakup was Kim Warnick's move to the band Visqueen in 2001 through 2004. In summer 2010 Kim Warnick started a new band with Mikey Davis called Cali Giraffes.[citation needed] The Fastbacks reunited for a one-off live performance 8 July 2011 at the West Seattle Summer Music Festival, featuring the core trio of Kurt, Kim and Lulu, along with Mike Musburger on drums, their first official show together since their break-up a decade ago."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Mike + The Mechanics are an English pop/rock supergroup formed in 1985 as a side project of Mike Rutherford, one of the founding members of the band Genesis. The band is known for their hit singles \"Silent Running (On Dangerous Ground)\", \"All I Need Is a Miracle\", \"Word of Mouth\", \"Over My Shoulder\", and \"The Living Years\". Initially, the band included Rutherford, vocalists Paul Carrack and Paul Young, keyboardist Adrian Lee and drummer Peter Van Hooke. Carrack was generally assigned to ballads and more pop-oriented numbers, while Young handled the band's heavier work. After a successful decade, Lee and Van Hooke dropped out in 1995, and were not replaced. Following Young's death in 2000, Carrack became the band's sole lead vocalist until 2004 when the band (essentially a duo at this point) went on hiatus, with Rutherford and Carrack both later saying the band had \"run its course\". The band identity was revived in 2010, consisting of Rutherford and a completely new set of musicians, including new vocalists Andrew Roachford and Tim Howar."@en ;

Through its existence, the band has had many members, with the only consistent bandmate of Corea's being bassist Stanley Clarke. Along with Weather Report and Mahavishnu Orchestra, Return to Forever is often cited as one of the core groups of the jazz-fusion movement of the 1970s. Several musicians, including Clarke, Flora Purim, Airto Moreira and Al Di Meola, first came to prominence through their performances on Return to Forever's albums. After playing on Miles Davis's groundbreaking jazz-fusion albums In a Silent Way and Bitches Brew, Corea formed an avant-garde jazz band called Circle with Dave Holland, Anthony Braxton and Barry Altschul. However, in 1972, after having become a member of Scientology, Corea decided that he wanted to better \"communicate\" with the audience. This essentially translated into his performing a more popularly accessible style of music, since avant-garde jazz enjoyed a relatively small audience."@en ;

The band finally decided to establish their own record label, named GoGo Records, and in February 2001 released their debut album Enter. The album sold 20,000 copies and contained, the single \"Tomorrow Never Dies\", written in collaboration with Tim Christensen. Enter peaked at position 27 in the Danish charts. In 2004, the band had another album, the self-titled Swan Lee which reached number one in the charts. The single \"I Don't Mind\" peaked at position three.

The line-up from 1967 to 1976 was Pinkney, Valerie Holiday and Sheila Ferguson, who would go on to sing lead on most of the group's biggest hits. This line-up topped the US Hot 100 as featured vocalists on the MFSB single \"TSOP (The Sound of Philadelphia)\" in 1974, and had seven UK Top 40 hits, including the 1974 single \"When Will I See You Again\", which was a huge international hit, peaking at number two in the US and topping the UK Singles Chart. When Pinkney left the group in 1976, she was replaced by a returning Helen Scott. This line-up had four UK Top 20 hits, including \"Woman in Love\", which reached number three in 1979. Ferguson left for a solo career in 1986. The group's most stable line-up was from 1989 to 2010, with Cynthia Garrison joining Holiday and Scott.

Their early works, such as debut album Bergtatt, were categorised as folklore-influenced black metal, but have since evolved a fluid and increasingly eclectic musical style, blending genres such as rock, electronica, symphonic and chamber traditions, noise and experimental music into their oeuvre. 1997 marked their international debut with the release of their third album Nattens madrigal through German label Century Media. However, following discord with the label, Kristoffer Rygg formed his own imprint Jester Records in 1998. British composer and multi-instrumentalist Daniel O'Sullivan joined the collective in 2009, and the band performed some of their first live concerts in their 15-year lifespan, including the prestigious Norwegian National Opera. Ulver have sold in excess of half a million records, have well over 11,000,000 plays on Last.fm, been twice nominated for the Norwegian Grammy Awards, Spellemannsprisen, in different categories, won Album of the Year at the Oslo Awards for Shadows of the Sun in 2008, won the NATT&DAG award for Best Live Act in 2011, and earned a global reputation for stylistic unpredictability. Acclaim from the artistic community includes controversial director of films Kids and Gummo, Harmony Korine, recently commented, alluding to The Marriage of Heaven and Hell: \"There's a real lineage from a composer like Wagner to a band like Ulver.\" Author and musician Julian Cope has said, \"Ulver are cataloguing the death of our culture two decades before anyone else has noticed its inevitable demise.\""@en ;

dbr:Foggy_Mountain_Boys	rdf:type	dbo:Band ;
	dbo:abstract	"The Foggy Mountain Boys was an American bluegrass band. The band was founded by guitarist Lester Flatt and banjo player Earl Scruggs and is viewed by music historians as one of the premier bluegrass groups in the history of the genre. The band was originally formed in 1948 by Flatt, who had been a member of Bill Monroe's bluegrass band. Flatt brought Scruggs with him shortly after leaving Monroe. Flatt and Scruggs and The Foggy Mountain Boys (in various forms and line-ups) recorded and performed together up until 1969. The Foggy Mountain Boys are seen as one of the landmark bands in bluegrass music. Although it featured various casts, during the years of The Lester Flatt and Earl Scruggs Grand Ole Opry Show, notably sponsored by grain and flour producer Martha White, the band showcased fiddle player Paul Warren, a master player in both the Old-Time and Bluegrass fiddling styles, whose technique reflected all qualitative aspects of 'the bluegrass breakdown' and fast bowing style; dobro player Uncle Josh Graves, an innovator of the advanced playing style of the instrument now used in the genre, stand-up bass player Cousin Jake Tullock, and mandolinist Curly Seckler. Scruggs is widely considered the most influential player of the bluegrass banjo who ever lived. Playing since the age of four, Scruggs gained his initial spotlight when he played briefly with Bill Monroe, considered by many as the father of bluegrass music. His lightning-fast syncopation and virtuosity wove themselves into an innovative three finger picking style that became the standard for mastering the instrument."@en ;

The group currently comprises Rob Thomas (lead vocals, piano, guitar), Brian Yale (bass guitar), Paul Doucette (drums, rhythm guitar, backing vocals), Kyle Cook (lead guitar, backing vocals), touring guitarist and keyboardist Matt Beck and touring drummer Stacy Jones. Matchbox Twenty rose to international fame with their debut album, Yourself or Someone Like You (1996), which was certified 12\u00D7 Platinum (diamond) in the United States and multi-platinum in Australia, Canada and New Zealand. Their second album, Mad Season, released in 2000, charted in the top three on the Billboard 200 and was certified 4\u00D7 Platinum in the United States. Their third album, More Than You Think You Are, released in 2002, was only certified 2x Platinum in the United States, despite its singles receiving significant airplay. Director Bill Draheim documented the band throughout the process while making More Than You Think You Are. The documentary \"Theresville\" was an online extra. The band then went on hiatus in 2004, with rhythm guitarist Adam Gaynor leaving the band in 2005 after performing on the first three studio albums. As a result, Paul Doucette took over rhythm guitar, and the band reunited and released a compilation album, Exile on Mainstream, in 2007, which was certified Gold in the United States. After the release, former Push Stars drummer Ryan MacMillan filled Doucette's vacated drum spot. During this period, Rob Thomas embarked on a successful solo career. Matchbox Twenty then took another hiatus, but reunited again in 2010. The band released North, their fourth album, on September 4, 2012 which made its debut at number one on the Billboard 200."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Deadly Venoms is a Wu-Tang Clan affiliated all-female hip hop group formed in 1997 consisting of N-Tyce, J-Boo, Champ MC and Finesse. X Clan affiliated rapper Lin Que was initially intended to be part of the group but departed soon after its inception due to business decisions. Each member of the group were experienced rappers prior to joining the collective. Finesse recorded an album with rapper Synquis named Soul Sisters in 1988, Champ released her debut album Ghetto Flava on Atlantic Records and EastWest Records, and N-Tyce was signed to Wild Pitch/EMI in the mid 90s and released a few singles including the RZA produced \"Hush Hush Tip\" featuring Method Man. The Deadly Venoms was J-Boo's professional introduction. A legal dispute with A&M/PolyGram Records and the then-forthcoming merger between the MCA and PolyGram families of labels that formed the Universal Music Group forced its debut album, Deadly Venoms: The Antidote, to remain in its vaults, although the single \u201COne More to Go\u201D (featuring Inspectah Deck, Method Man, Cappadonna, Street Life, and GZA) b/w \u201CBomb Threat,\u201D was released and the album was later leaked. Despite not being properly released the album got positive reviews. The group was also featured on NBA All-Star and rapper Shaquille O'Neal's 1998 album Respect. Deadly Venoms' second album, Pretty Thugs, was also never properly released because of similar label disputes, this time with DreamWorks/Interscope/Universal Records. However, as with Antidote, copies of the record were leaked, and a promo CD was pressed. After the departure of Finesse due to undisclosed business reasons, the group finally managed to release an album with 2002's Still Standing, on Rocks the World/Caroline/Virgin/EMI Records."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Alice in Chains is an American rock band formed in Seattle, Washington, in 1987 by guitarist and songwriter Jerry Cantrell and original lead vocalist Layne Staley. The initial lineup was rounded out by drummer Sean Kinney and bassist Mike Starr, who was replaced in 1993 by Mike Inez. Although widely associated with grunge music, the band's sound incorporates heavy metal elements. Since its formation, Alice in Chains has released five studio albums, three EPs, two live albums, four compilations, and two DVDs. The band is known for its distinctive vocal style, which often included the harmonized vocals of Staley and Cantrell (and later William DuVall). Alice in Chains rose to international fame as part of the grunge movement of the early 1990s, along with other Seattle bands such as Nirvana, Pearl Jam, and Soundgarden. The band was one of the most successful music acts of the 1990s, selling over 20 million albums worldwide, and over 14 million in the US alone. In 1992 the band's second album, Dirt, was released to critical acclaim and was certified quadruple platinum. Their third album, Alice in Chains, was released in 1995 and has been certified double platinum. Both albums achieved No. 1 Billboard 200 releases. The band has had 14 top ten songs on the Mainstream Rock Tracks chart and nine Grammy Award nominations. Although never officially disbanding, Alice in Chains was plagued by extended inactivity from 1996 onwards due to Staley's substance abuse, which resulted in his death in 2002. The band reunited in 2005 for a live benefit show, performing with a number of guest vocalists. They toured in 2006, with William DuVall taking over as lead vocalist full-time. The new line-up released the band's fourth studio album, Black Gives Way to Blue, in 2009. The album received gold certification by the RIAA. In 2013, the band released The Devil Put Dinosaurs Here, its fifth studio album. The band has toured extensively and released several videos in support of these albums. Alice in Chains is currently working on their sixth studio album."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Bill Haley & His Comets was an American rock and roll band, founded in 1952 and continued until Haley's death in 1981. The band, also known as Bill Haley and the Comets and Bill Haley's Comets (and variations thereof), was the earliest group of white musicians to bring rock and roll to the attention of white America and the rest of the world. From late 1954 to late 1956, the group placed nine singles in the Top 20, one of those a number one and three more in the Top Ten. Bandleader Bill Haley had previously been a country music performer; after recording a country and western-styled version of \"Rocket 88\", a rhythm and blues song, he changed musical direction to a new sound which came to be called rock and roll. Although several members of the Comets became famous, Bill Haley remained the star. With his spit curl and the band's matching plaid dinner jackets and energetic stage behavior, many fans consider them to be as revolutionary in their time as the Beatles or the Rolling Stones were a decade later. Following Haley's death, no fewer than seven different groups have existed under the Comets name, all claiming (with varying degrees of authority) to be the continuation of Haley's group. As of the end of 2014, four such groups were still performing in the United States and internationally."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Cream were a 1960s British rock supergroup power trio consisting of bassist/singer Jack Bruce, drummer Ginger Baker, and guitarist/singer Eric Clapton. Their unique sound was characterised by a hybrid of blues rock, hard rock and psychedelic rock, combining psychedelia themes, Clapton's blues guitar playing, Bruce's powerful, versatile vocals and prominent bass playing, Baker's distinctive, pulsating, jazz-influenced drumming and Pete Brown's poetry-inspired lyrics. The group's third album, Wheels of Fire (1968), was the world's first platinum-selling double album. The band is widely regarded as being the world's first successful supergroup. In their career, they sold more than 15 million albums worldwide. Their music included songs based on traditional blues such as \"Crossroads\" and \"Spoonful\", and modern blues such as \"Born Under a Bad Sign\", as well as more eccentric songs such as \"Strange Brew\", \"Tales of Brave Ulysses\" and \"Toad\". The band's biggest hits are \"I Feel Free\" (UK, number 11), \"Sunshine of Your Love\" (US, number 5), \"White Room\" (US, number 6), \"Crossroads\" (US, number 28), and \"Badge\" (UK, number 18). The band made a significant impact on the popular music of the time, and, along with Jimi Hendrix and other notable guitarists and bands, popularised the use of the wah-wah pedal. They provided a heavy yet technically proficient musical theme that foreshadowed and influenced the emergence of British bands such as Led Zeppelin, The Jeff Beck Group, Deep Purple and Black Sabbath in the late 1960s and the early 1970s. The band's live performances influenced progressive rock acts such as Rush. The band was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1993. They were included in both Rolling Stone and VH1's lists of the \"100 Greatest Artists of All Time,\" at number 67 and 61 respectively.

The group consisted of keyboardist Keith Emerson, singer, guitarist, and producer Greg Lake, and drummer and percussionist Carl Palmer. They were one of the most popular and commercially successful progressive rock bands in the 1970s. After forming in early 1970, the band came to prominence following their performance at the Isle of Wight Festival in August 1970. In their first year, the group signed with Atlantic Records and released Emerson, Lake & Palmer (1970) and Tarkus (1971), both of which reached the UK top five. The band's success continued with Pictures at an Exhibition (1971), Trilogy (1972), and Brain Salad Surgery (1973). After a three-year break, Emerson, Lake & Palmer released Works Volume 1 (1977) and Works Volume 2 (1977) which began their decline in popularity. After Love Beach (1978), the group disbanded in 1979. They reformed in 1991 and released Black Moon (1992) and In the Hot Seat (1994). Emerson and Palmer continued in 1996 and toured until 1998. Lake returned in 2010 for the band's headline performance at the High Voltage Festival in London to commemorate the band's fortieth anniversary. Their musical sound included adaptations of classical music with jazz and symphonic rock elements and was dominated by Emerson's flamboyant use of the Hammond organ, Moog synthesizer, and piano.

	dbo:abstract	"Genesis are an English rock band formed at Charterhouse School, Godalming, Surrey in 1967. The most commercially successful line-up includes keyboardist Tony Banks, bassist/guitarist Mike Rutherford and drummer/singer Phil Collins. Other important members were singer Peter Gabriel and guitarist Steve Hackett. The band underwent many changes in musical style over its career, from folk music to progressive rock in the 1970s, before moving towards pop at the end of the decade. They have sold 21.5 million RIAA-certified albums in the US and their worldwide sales are estimated to be between 100 million and 130 million. Formed by five Charterhouse pupils including Banks, Rutherford, Gabriel, and Anthony Phillips, Genesis was named by former pupil Jonathan King who arranged them to record several unsuccessful singles and an album. After splitting with King, the group began touring professionally, signing with Charisma Records. Following the departure of Phillips, Genesis recruited Collins and Hackett and recorded several progressive rock style albums, with live shows centred around Gabriel's theatrical costumes and performances. The group were initially commercially successful in Europe, before entering the UK charts with Foxtrot (1972). They followed this with Selling England by the Pound (1973) and The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway (1974) before Gabriel decided to leave the group. After an unsuccessful search for a replacement, Collins took over as lead singer, while the group gained popularity in the UK and the US. Following A Trick of the Tail and Wind & Wuthering (both 1976), Hackett left the band, reducing it to a core of Banks, Rutherford, and Collins. Genesis had their first UK top ten and US top 30 single in 1978 with \"Follow You Follow Me\" and the group continued to gain commercial success with Duke (1980), Abacab (1981), and Genesis (1983), reaching a peak with Invisible Touch (1986), which featured five US top five singles. Its title track reached number one in the US. After the follow up, We Can't Dance (1991) and related tour, Collins left Genesis in 1996 to focus on his solo career. Banks and Rutherford recruited Ray Wilson for Calling All Stations (1997), but a lack of success in the US led to a group hiatus. Banks, Rutherford and Collins reunited for the Turn It On Again Tour in 2007, and together with Gabriel and Hackett were interviewed for the BBC documentary Genesis: Together and Apart in 2014. Their discography includes fifteen studio and six live albums, six of which topped the UK chart. They have won numerous awards and nominations, including a Grammy Award for Best Concept Music Video with \"Land of Confusion\", and inspired a number of tribute bands recreating Genesis shows from various stages of the band's career. In 2010, Genesis were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame."@en ;

dbr:Green_Day	rdf:type	dbo:Band ;
	dbo:abstract	"Green Day is an American punk rock band formed in 1986 by vocalist/guitarist Billie Joe Armstrong and bassist Mike Dirnt. For much of their career, the band has been a trio with drummer Tr\u00E9 Cool, who replaced former drummer John Kiffmeyer in 1990 prior to the recording of the band's second studio album, Kerplunk (1992). In 2012, guitarist Jason White became a full-time member after having performed with the band as a session and touring member since 1999. Green Day was originally part of the punk scene at the DIY 924 Gilman Street club in Berkeley, California. The band's early releases were with the independent record label Lookout! Records. In 1994, its major label debut Dookie (released through Reprise Records) became a breakout success and eventually shipped over 10 million copies in the U.S. Green Day was widely credited, alongside fellow California punk bands Sublime, Bad Religion, The Offspring and Rancid, with popularizing and reviving mainstream interest in punk rock in the United States. Green Day's three follow-up albums, Insomniac (1995), Nimrod (1997), and Warning (2000) did not achieve the massive success of Dookie, though they were still successful, with Insomniac and Nimrod reaching double platinum and Warning achieving gold status. The band's rock opera, American Idiot (2004), reignited the band's popularity with a younger generation, selling six million copies in the U.S. The band's eighth studio album, 21st Century Breakdown, was released in 2009 and achieved the band's best chart performance to date. 21st Century Breakdown was followed up by a trilogy of albums called \u00A1Uno!, \u00A1Dos!, and \u00A1Tr\u00E9!, which were released in September, November and December 2012 respectively. Green Day has sold more than 75 million records worldwide. The group has won five Grammy Awards: Best Alternative Album for Dookie, Best Rock Album for American Idiot, Record of the Year for \"Boulevard of Broken Dreams\", Best Rock Album for the second time for 21st Century Breakdown and Best Musical Show Album for American Idiot: The Original Broadway Cast Recording. In 2010, a stage adaptation of American Idiot debuted on Broadway. The musical was nominated for three Tony Awards: Best Musical, Best Scenic Design and Best Lighting Design, losing only the first. Also in 2010, Green Day were ranked no. 91 in the VH1 list of the \"100 Greatest Artists of All Time\". On April 18, 2015, the band was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a part of the 2015 class, in their first year of eligibility."@en ;

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rancid_(band)>	rdf:type	dbo:Band ;
	dbo:abstract	"Rancid is an American punk rock band formed in Berkeley, California, in 1991. Founded by 1980s punk veterans Tim Armstrong and Matt Freeman, who previously played in the highly influential ska punk band Operation Ivy, Rancid is often credited, along with Green Day and the Offspring, for reviving mainstream interest in punk rock in the United States and bringing punk rock into the mainstream during the mid-1990s. Unlike many of their contemporaries, however, Rancid remained signed to an independent record label and retained much of its original fan-base, most of which was connected to its underground roots. Rancid includes Tim Armstrong on guitar and vocals, Freeman on bass and vocals, Lars Frederiksen on guitar and vocals, and Branden Steineckert on drums. The band was formed by Armstrong, Freeman, and former drummer Brett Reed, who left the band in 2006 and was replaced by Steineckert. Frederiksen joined Rancid in 1993 when the band was searching for a second guitar player. To date, Rancid has released eight studio albums, one split album, one compilation, two extended plays, and a series of live online-only albums, and has been featured on a number of compilation albums. The band has independently sold over four million records worldwide, making it one of the most successful independent punk rock groups of all time. The band rose to fame in 1994 with its second studio album, Let's Go, featuring the single \"Salvation\". In the following year, Rancid released its highly successful album ...And Out Come the Wolves, which produced its best-known songs \"Roots Radicals\", \"Ruby Soho\" and \"Time Bomb\", and was certified gold and platinum by the RIAA, selling over one million copies in the United States alone. Its next four albums \u2014 Life Won't Wait (1998), Rancid (2000), Indestructible (2003) and Let the Dominoes Fall (2009) \u2014 were also critically acclaimed, though not as successful as ...And Out Come the Wolves. Rancid released ...Honor Is All We Know, their first studio album in five years, on October 27, 2014. They are currently working on a new album."@en ;

dbr:The_Smiths	rdf:type	dbo:Band ;
	dbo:abstract	"The Smiths were an English rock band formed in Manchester in 1982. The band consisted of vocalist Morrissey, guitarist Johnny Marr, bassist Andy Rourke and drummer Mike Joyce. Critics have called them the most important alternative rock band to emerge from the British independent music scene of the 1980s. Q magazine's Simon Goddard argued in 2007 that The Smiths were \"the one truly vital voice of the '80s\", \"the most influential British guitar group of the decade\" and the \"first indie outsiders to achieve mainstream success on their own terms\".The NME named the Smiths the \"most influential artist ever\" in a 2002 poll. Based on the songwriting partnership of Morrissey and Marr, the group signed to the independent record label Rough Trade Records, on which they released four studio albums, The Smiths (1984), Meat Is Murder (1985), The Queen Is Dead (1986) and Strangeways, Here We Come (1987). Four of their albums (including three studio albums) appeared on Rolling Stone's list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time. They have also released several compilations, and numerous non-LP singles. The Smiths had several singles reach the UK top twenty and all four of their studio albums reached the UK top five, including one which topped the charts. They won a significant following and remain cult favourites, although they had limited commercial success outside the UK while they were still together. The band broke up in 1987 and have turned down several offers to reunite. The band's focus on a guitar, bass, and drum sound, and their fusion of 1960s rock and post-punk, were a repudiation of synthesizer-based contemporary dance-pop \u2013 the style popular in the early 1980s. Marr's guitar-playing on his Rickenbacker often had a jangly sound reminiscent of Roger McGuinn of the Byrds. Marr's guitar-playing influenced later Manchester bands, including The Stone Roses and Oasis. Morrissey and Marr's songs combined themes about ordinary people with complex, literate lyrics delivered by Morrissey with a mordant sense of humour. In 2014 and 2015, they were nominated for induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame."@en ;

The group consisted of Peter Murphy (vocals, occasional instruments), Daniel Ash (guitar), Kevin Haskins (drums) and David J (bass). Although they dropped the numerical portion within a year of formation, the band was originally named Bauhaus 1919, in reference to the first operating year of the art school Bauhaus. Generally considered the first gothic rock group, Bauhaus were known for their gloomy sound and dark image. Musically however, the band was also quite diverse. Throughout their career, they incorporated a variety of genres, ranging from reggae to funk. Bauhaus broke up in 1983. Peter Murphy began a solo career while Ash and Haskins continued as Tones on Tail and, later, reunited with David J to form Love and Rockets. Both enjoyed greater commercial success in the United States than Bauhaus had, but disappeared from the charts in their homeland. Bauhaus eventually reunited for a 1998 tour and again from 2005\u20132008."@en ;

They are regarded as an important influence on the Manchester music scene, the independent record label movement, punk rock, power pop, and indie rock. They achieved commercial success with singles that fused pop craftsmanship with rapid-fire punk energy. These singles were collected on Singles Going Steady, described by critic Ned Raggett as a \"punk masterpiece\". Devoto and Shelley chose the name \"Buzzcocks\" after reading the headline, \"It's the Buzz, Cock!\", in a review of the TV series Rock Follies in Time Out magazine. The \"buzz\" is the excitement of playing on stage; \"cock\" is Manchester slang meaning \"mate\" (as in friend/buddy). They thought it captured the excitement of the Sex Pistols and nascent punk scene."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Deep Purple are an English rock band formed in Hertford in 1968. They are considered to be among the pioneers of heavy metal and modern hard rock, although their musical approach changed over the years. Originally formed as a progressive rock band, the band shifted to a heavier sound in 1970. Deep Purple, together with Led Zeppelin and Black Sabbath, have been referred to as the \"unholy trinity of British hard rock and heavy metal in the early to mid-seventies\". They were listed in the 1975 Guinness Book of World Records as \"the globe's loudest band\" for a 1972 concert at London's Rainbow Theatre, and have sold over 100 million albums worldwide. Deep Purple have had several line-up changes and an eight-year hiatus (1976\u20131984). The 1968\u20131976 line-ups are commonly labelled Mark I, II, III and IV. Their second and most commercially successful line-up featured Ian Gillan (vocals), Jon Lord (organ), Roger Glover (bass), Ian Paice (drums), and Ritchie Blackmore (guitar). This line-up was active from 1969 to 1973, and was revived from 1984 to 1989, and again from 1992 to 1993. The band achieved more modest success in the intervening periods between 1968 and 1969 with the line-up including Rod Evans (vocals) and Nick Simper (bass, backing vocals), between 1974 and 1976 (Tommy Bolin replacing Blackmore in 1975) with the line-up including David Coverdale (vocals) and Glenn Hughes (bass, vocals), and between 1989 and 1992 with the line-up including Joe Lynn Turner (vocals). The band's line-up (currently featuring Ian Gillan, and guitarist Steve Morse from 1994) has been much more stable in recent years, although organist Jon Lord's retirement from the band in 2002 (being succeeded by Don Airey) left Ian Paice as the only original Deep Purple member still in the band. Deep Purple were ranked number 22 on VH1's Greatest Artists of Hard Rock programme and a poll on British radio station Planet Rock ranked them 5th among the \"most influential bands ever\". The band received the Legend Award at the 2008 World Music Awards. Having been nominated for induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2012 and 2013, Deep Purple were announced as inductees into the Hall of Fame in December 2015."@en ;

In an interview for MTV in February 2007, bassist Joey DeMaio lamented that \"these days, there's a real lack of big, epic metal that is drenched with crushing guitars and choirs and orchestras... so it's nice to be one of the few bands that's actually doing that.\" In 1984 the band was included in the Guinness Book of World Records for delivering the loudest performance, a record which they have since broken on 2 occasions. They also hold the world record for the longest heavy metal concert after playing for 5 hours and 1 minute in Bulgaria in 2008. They also have been known for their slogan \"Death to false metal\". Although the band has never been a mainstream commercial success in the United States, they maintain a strong cult following there. In contrast, they are extremely popular in the heavy metal scene in Europe and South America. Dedicated fans are known and referred to by the band as \"Metal Warriors\", \"Manowarriors\", \"Immortals\" or \"Brothers of Metal\".[citation needed]."@en ;

They emerged from the post-punk music scene in Britain, are credited with creating a bridge between punk rock and classic progressive rock, and became the most commercially successful neo-progressive rock band of the 1980s. They have sold more than 15 million albums. Marillion's recorded studio output since 1982 is composed of seventeen albums generally regarded in two distinct eras, delineated by the departure of original frontman Fish in late 1988, and the subsequent arrival of replacement Steve Hogarth in early 1989. The band achieved eight Top Ten UK albums between 1983 and 1994, including a number one album in 1985 with Misplaced Childhood, and during the period the band were fronted by Fish they scored eleven Top 40 hits on the UK Singles Chart. They are best known for the 1985 singles \"Kayleigh\" and \"Lavender\", which reached number two and number five respectively. The first album released with Hogarth, 1989's Seasons End, was another Top Ten hit, and albums continued to chart well until their departure from EMI following the release of their 1996 live album Made Again and the dissipation of the band's mainstream popularity in the late 1990s; save for a resurgence in the mid- to late-2000s, they have essentially been a cult act since then. Marillion have achieved a further twelve Top 40 hit singles in the UK with Hogarth, including 2004's \"You're Gone\", which charted at No. 7 and is the biggest hit of his tenure. The band continue to tour internationally, and were ranked 38th in Classic Rock's \"50 Best Live Acts of All Time\" in 2008. Marillion are widely considered to have been one of the first mainstream acts to have fully recognised and tapped the potential for commercial musicians to interact with their fans via the internet, starting in around 1996, and are nowadays often characterised as a rock & roll 'Web Cottage Industry'. The history of the band's use of the Internet is described by Michael Lewis in the book Next: The Future Just Happened as an example of how the Internet is shifting power away from established elites, such as multinational record labels and record producers. The band are renowned for having an extremely dedicated following (often self-termed 'Freaks'), with some fans regularly travelling significant distances to attend single gigs, driven in large part by the close fan base involvement which the band cultivate via their website, podcasts, biennial conventions and regular fanclub publications. The release of their 2001 album Anoraknophobia, which was funded by their fans through advance orders instead of by the band signing to a record company, gained significant attention and was called \"a unique funding campaign\" by the BBC. Writing for The Guardian, Alexis Petridis described Marillion as \"the undisputed pioneers\" of fan-funded music."@en ;

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Queen_(band)>	rdf:type	dbo:Band ;
	dbo:abstract	"Queen are a British rock band that formed in London in 1970. The classic line-up was Freddie Mercury (lead vocals, piano), Brian May (guitar, vocals), Roger Taylor (drums, vocals), and John Deacon (bass guitar). Queen's earliest works were influenced by progressive rock, hard rock and heavy metal, but the band gradually ventured into more conventional and radio-friendly works by incorporating further styles, such as arena rock and pop rock, into their music. Before forming Queen, Brian May and Roger Taylor had played together in a band named Smile. Freddie Mercury (then known by his birth name of Farrokh \"Freddie\" Bulsara) was a fan of Smile and encouraged them to experiment with more elaborate stage and recording techniques. Mercury joined the band in 1970, suggested \"Queen\" as a new band name, and adopted his familiar stage name. John Deacon was recruited prior to recording their eponymous debut album in 1973. Queen first charted in the UK with their second album, Queen II, in 1974, but it was the release of Sheer Heart Attack later that year and A Night at the Opera in 1975 which brought them international success. The latter featured \"Bohemian Rhapsody\", which stayed at number one in the UK for nine weeks and popularised the music video. Their 1977 album, News of the World, contained \"We Will Rock You\" and \"We Are the Champions\", which have become anthems at sporting events. By the early 1980s, Queen were one of the biggest stadium rock bands in the world. Their performance at 1985's Live Aid is ranked among the greatest in rock history by various music publications, with a 2005 industry poll ranking it the best. In 1991, Mercury died of bronchopneumonia, a complication of AIDS, and Deacon retired in 1997. Since then, May and Taylor have occasionally performed together, including with Paul Rodgers (2004\u201309) and with Adam Lambert (since 2011). In November 2014, Queen released a new album, Queen Forever, featuring vocals from the late Mercury. The band have released a total of 18 number one albums, 18 number one singles, and 10 number one DVDs. Estimates of their record sales generally range from 150 million to 300 million records, making them one of the world's best-selling music artists. Queen received the Outstanding Contribution to British Music Award from the British Phonographic Industry in 1990. They were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2001."@en ;

dbr:Sex_Pistols	rdf:type	dbo:Band ;
	dbo:abstract	"The Sex Pistols were an English punk rock band formed in London in 1975. Although they initially lasted just two and a half years and produced only four singles and one studio album, Never Mind the Bollocks, Here's the Sex Pistols, they are considered one of the most influential acts in the history of popular music, initiated a punk movement in the United Kingdom, and inspired many later punk and alternative rock musicians. The first incarnation of the Sex Pistols included singer John Lydon (aka Johnny Rotten), lead guitarist Steve Jones, drummer Paul Cook and bassist Glen Matlock. Matlock was replaced by Sid Vicious early in 1977. Under the management of Malcolm McLaren, a visual artist, performer, clothes designer and boutique owner, the band provoked controversies that garnered a significant amount of publicity. Their concerts repeatedly faced difficulties with organisers and local authorities, and public appearances often ended in mayhem. Their 1977 single \"God Save the Queen\", attacking social conformity and deference to the Crown, precipitated the \"last and greatest outbreak of pop-based moral pandemonium\". Subjects addressed in their frequently obscene lyrics included the music industry, consumerism, abortion, violence, apathy, anarchy, fascism, the British Royal Family and the Holocaust. In January 1978, at the end of a turbulent tour of the United States, Rotten left the Sex Pistols and announced its break-up. Over the next several months, the three other band members recorded songs for McLaren's film version of the Sex Pistols' story, The Great Rock 'n' Roll Swindle. Vicious died of a heroin overdose in February 1979. In 1996, Rotten, Jones, Cook and Matlock reunited for the Filthy Lucre Tour; since 2002, they have staged further reunion shows and tours. On 24 February 2006, the Sex Pistols\u2014the four original, surviving members and Sid Vicious\u2014were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, but they refused to attend the ceremony, calling the museum \"a piss stain\"."@en ;

Initially associated with the English punk rock scene, the band rapidly evolved to create \"a form of post-punk discord full of daring rhythmic and sonic experimentation\". The Times cited Siouxsie and the Banshees as \"one of the most audacious and uncompromising musical adventurers of the post-punk era\". With the release of Juju in 1981, the group also became an important influence on the emerging gothic rock scene. They disbanded in 1996, with Siouxsie and drummer Budgie continuing to record music as The Creatures, a second band they had formed in the early 1980s. In 2004, Siouxsie began a solo career."@en ;

They are best known for their first album, Becoming X (1996), and the singles \"6 Underground\" and \"Spin Spin Sugar\". They took their name from an article the Beastie Boys published in their Grand Royal magazine about a man they hired to track down classic sneakers. The band's founding members were Liam Howe and Chris Corner, who then recruited Kelli Dayton (formerly of Lumieres, now recording under the name Kelli Ali) for vocal duties and long-time friend Ian Pickering to provide lyrics. After the first album, the band felt that demos for the second album (on which Corner provided the guide vocals) better suited his voice, especially in regard to the more raw, personal quality of the lyrics. Following the promotional tour for Becoming X, Kelli was dismissed from the group, and Corner became the singer. In May of 2015, founding member Liam Howe hinted via Twitter that Sneaker Pimps would return to release their 4th album. It is unknown whether Chris Corner, co-founder and current frontman of IAMX, will feature on the new album."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Soundgarden is an American rock band formed in Seattle, Washington, in 1984 by singer and rhythm guitarist Chris Cornell, lead guitarist Kim Thayil, and bassist Hiro Yamamoto. Matt Cameron became the band's full-time drummer in 1986, while bassist Ben Shepherd became a permanent replacement for Yamamoto in 1990. Soundgarden was one of the seminal bands in the creation of grunge, a style of alternative rock that developed in Seattle, and was one of a number of grunge bands signed to the record label Sub Pop. Soundgarden was the first grunge band to sign to a major label (A&M Records, in 1988), though the band did not achieve commercial success until they popularized the genre in the early 1990s with Seattle contemporaries Pearl Jam, Nirvana, and Alice in Chains. Soundgarden achieved its biggest success with the 1994 album Superunknown, which debuted at number one on the Billboard charts and yielded the Grammy Award-winning singles \"Black Hole Sun\" and \"Spoonman\". In 1997, the band broke up due to internal strife over its creative direction. After more than a decade of working on projects and other bands, Soundgarden reunited in 2010 and their sixth studio album, King Animal, was released two years later. As of 2012, Soundgarden had sold more than 10.5 million records in the United States, and an estimated 22.5 million worldwide. VH1 ranked Soundgarden at number 14 in their special 100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock."@en ;

The band comprised David Byrne (lead vocals, guitar), Chris Frantz (drums), Tina Weymouth (bass), and Jerry Harrison (keyboards, guitar). Former art school students who became involved in the 1970s New York punk scene, Talking Heads integrated elements of punk, art rock, funk, dance, and world music with avant-garde sensibilities and the anxious stage persona of singer Byrne, helping to pioneer new wave music. The group produced several commercial hits and a number of multimedia projects throughout its career, and often collaborated with other artists, such as musician Brian Eno and director Jonathan Demme. Critic Stephen Thomas Erlewine described Talking Heads as \"one of the most critically acclaimed bands of the '80s.\" In 2002, the band was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Four of the band's albums appeared on Rolling Stone's list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time, and three of their songs (\"Psycho Killer\", \"Life During Wartime\", and \"Once in a Lifetime\") were included among The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll.

	dbo:abstract	"The Band was a Canadian-American roots rock group, originally consisting of Rick Danko (bass guitar, double bass, fiddle, vocals), Levon Helm (drums, mandolin, guitar, vocals), Garth Hudson (keyboards, saxophones, trumpet), Richard Manuel (piano, drums, vocals) and Robbie Robertson (guitar, percussion, vocals). The members of the Band first came together as they joined rockabilly singer Ronnie Hawkins's backing group, the Hawks, one by one between 1958 and 1963. In 1964, they separated from Hawkins, after which they toured and released a few singles as Levon and the Hawks and the Canadian Squires. The next year, Bob Dylan hired them for his U.S. tour in 1965 and world tour in 1966. Following the 1966 tour, the group moved with Dylan to Saugerties, New York, where they made the informal 1967 recordings that became The Basement Tapes, which forged the basis for their 1968 debut album, Music from Big Pink. Because they were always \"the band\" to various frontmen, Helm said the name \"The Band\" worked well when the group came into its own. The group began performing as the Band in 1968 and went on to release ten studio albums. Dylan continued to collaborate with the Band over the course of their career, including a joint 1974 tour. The original configuration of the Band ended its touring career in 1976 with an elaborate live ballroom performance featuring numerous musical celebrities. This performance was immortalized in Martin Scorsese's 1978 documentary The Last Waltz. The Band recommenced touring in 1983 without guitarist Robbie Robertson, who had found success with a solo career and as a Hollywood music producer. Following a 1986 show, Richard Manuel was found dead of suicide, but the remaining three members continued to tour and record albums with a succession of musicians filling Manuel's and Robertson's roles; the final configuration of the group included Richard Bell (piano), Randy Ciarlante (drums), and Jim Weider (guitar). Danko died of heart failure in 1999, after which the group broke up for good. Levon Helm was diagnosed with throat cancer in 1998 and was unable to sing for several years, but he eventually regained the use of his voice. He continued to perform and released several successful albums until he succumbed to the disease in 2012. The group was inducted into the Canadian Music Hall of Fame in 1989 and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1994. In 2004 Rolling Stone ranked them No. 50 on their list of the 100 greatest artists of all time, and in 2008 they received the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award. In 2004, \"The Weight\" was ranked 41st on Rolling Stone's list of the 500 greatest songs of all time. In 2014, the Band was inducted into Canada's Walk of Fame."@en ;

dbr:The_Beatles	rdf:type	dbo:Band ;
	dbo:abstract	"The Beatles were an English rock band, formed in Liverpool in 1960. With members John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr, they became widely regarded as the foremost and most influential act of the rock era. Rooted in skiffle, beat, and 1950s rock and roll, the Beatles later experimented with several genres, ranging from pop ballads and Indian music to psychedelia and hard rock, often incorporating classical elements in innovative ways. In the early 1960s, their enormous popularity first emerged as \"Beatlemania\", but as the group's music grew in sophistication, led by primary songwriters Lennon and McCartney, they came to be perceived as an embodiment of the ideals shared by the counterculture of the 1960s. The Beatles built their reputation playing clubs in Liverpool and Hamburg over a three-year period from 1960, with Stuart Sutcliffe initially serving as bass player. The core of Lennon, McCartney and Harrison went through a succession of drummers, most notably Pete Best, before asking Starr to join them. Manager Brian Epstein moulded them into a professional act and producer George Martin enhanced their musical potential. They gained popularity in the United Kingdom after their first hit, \"Love Me Do\", in late 1962. They acquired the nickname \"the Fab Four\" as Beatlemania grew in Britain over the following year, and by early 1964 they had become international stars, leading the \"British Invasion\" of the United States pop market. From 1965 onwards, the Beatles produced what many consider their finest material, including the innovative and widely influential albums Rubber Soul (1965), Revolver (1966), Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band (1967), The Beatles (commonly known as the White Album, 1968) and Abbey Road (1969). After their break-up in 1970, they each enjoyed successful musical careers of varying lengths. McCartney and Starr, the surviving members, remain musically active. Lennon was shot and killed in December 1980, and Harrison died of lung cancer in November 2001. According to the RIAA, the Beatles are the best-selling music artists in the United States, with 178 million certified units. They have had more number-one albums on the British charts and sold more singles in the UK than any other act. In 2008, the group topped Billboard magazine's list of the all-time most successful \"Hot 100\" artists; as of 2015, they hold the record for most number-one hits on the Hot 100 chart with twenty. They have received ten Grammy Awards, an Academy Award for Best Original Song Score and fifteen Ivor Novello Awards. Collectively included in Time magazine's compilation of the twentieth century's 100 most influential people, they are the best-selling band in history, with estimated sales of over 600 million records worldwide. The group was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1988, with all four being inducted individually as well from 1994 to 2015."@en ;

Soon after the album's release, Horn and Downes joined the progressive rock band Yes, recording and releasing Drama in the process. Following a tour to promote the album, Yes disbanded in 1981. That year, The Buggles released a second album, Adventures in Modern Recording. Its lack of commercial success led to the break up of the group.

	dbo:abstract	"The Cure are an English rock band formed in Crawley, West Sussex, in 1976. The band has experienced several line-up changes, with vocalist, guitarist and principal songwriter Robert Smith being the only constant member. The Cure first began releasing music in the late 1970s with their debut album Three Imaginary Boys; this, along with several early singles, placed the band as part of the post-punk and new wave movements that had sprung up in the wake of the punk rock revolution in the United Kingdom. During the early 1980s, the band's increasingly dark and tormented music was a staple of the emerging gothic rock genre. After the release of 1982's Pornography, the band's future was uncertain and Smith was keen to move past the gloomy reputation his band had acquired. With the single \"Let's Go to Bed\" released the same year, Smith began to place a pop sensibility into the band's music and their popularity increased as the decade wore on, with songs like \"Just Like Heaven\", \"Lovesong\" and \"Friday I'm in Love\". The band is estimated to have sold 27 million albums as of 2004 and have released thirteen studio albums, ten EPs and over thirty singles during their career."@en ;

dbr:The_Doors	rdf:type	dbo:Band ;
	dbo:abstract	"The Doors were an American rock band formed in 1965 in Los Angeles, with vocalist Jim Morrison, keyboardist Ray Manzarek, guitarist Robby Krieger and drummer John Densmore. The band got its name from the title of Aldous Huxley's book The Doors of Perception, which itself was a reference to a quote made by William Blake, \"If the doors of perception were cleansed, everything would appear to man as it is, infinite.\" They were unique and among the most controversial and influential rock acts of the 1960s, mostly because of Morrison's lyrics and charismatic but unpredictable stage persona. After Morrison's death on 3 July 1971 at age 27, the remaining members continued as a trio until disbanding in 1973. Signing with Elektra Records in 1966, the Doors released eight albums between 1967 and 1971. All but one hit the Top 10 on the Billboard 200 and went platinum or better. Their self-titled debut album (1967) was their first in a series of Top 10 albums in the United States, followed by Strange Days (also 1967), Waiting for the Sun (1968), The Soft Parade (1969), Morrison Hotel (1970), Absolutely Live (1970) and L.A. Woman (1971), with 20 Gold, 14 Platinum, and 5 Multi-Platinum album awards in the United States alone. By the end of 1971, it was reported that the Doors had sold 4,190,457 albums domestically and 7,750,642 singles. The band had three million-selling singles in the U.S. with \"Light My Fire\", \"Hello, I Love You\" and \"Touch Me\". After Morrison's death in 1971, the surviving trio released two albums Other Voices and Full Circle with Manzarek and Krieger sharing lead vocals. The three members also collaborated on the spoken-word recording of Morrison's An American Prayer in 1978 and on the \"Orange County Suite\" for a 1997 boxed set. Manzarek, Krieger and Densmore reunited in 2000 for an episode of VH1's \"Storytellers\" and subsequently recorded Stoned Immaculate: The Music of The Doors with a variety of vocalists. Although the Doors' active career ended in 1973, their popularity has persisted. According to the RIAA, they have sold 33 million certified units in the US and over 100 million records worldwide, making them one of the best-selling bands of all time. The Doors have been listed as one of the greatest artists of all time by many magazines, including Rolling Stone, which ranked them 41st on its list of the \"100 Greatest Artists of All Time\". The Doors were the first American band to accumulate eight consecutive gold and platinum LP's. In 2002, Manzarek and Krieger started playing together again, branding themselves as the Doors of the 21st Century, with Ian Astbury of the Cult on vocals. Densmore opted to sit out and, along with the Morrison estate, sued the duo over proper use of the band's name and won. After a short time as Riders On the Storm, they settled on the name Manzarek-Krieger and continued to tour until Manzarek's death in 2013 at the age of 74. Three of the band's studio albums, the self-titled debut, L.A. Woman, and Strange Days, were featured in Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time, at positions 42, 362, and 407 respectively. The band, their work, and Morrison's celebrity are considered important to the counterculture of the 1960s. The Doors were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1993."@en ;

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/The_Fall_(band)>	rdf:type	dbo:Band ;
	dbo:abstract	"The Fall are an English post-punk band, formed in 1976 in Prestwich, Greater Manchester. With an ever-changing line up, the Fall essentially consists of founder and only constant member, Mark E. Smith, who has quipped, \"If it's me and your granny on bongos, then it's The Fall\". First associated with the late 1970s punk movement, the band's music has evolved through numerous stylistic changes, often concurrently with changes in the group's line-up. Nonetheless, the Fall's music is typically characterised by repetition and an abrasive guitar-driven sound, and is always underpinned by Smith's typically cryptic lyrics, described by Steve Huey as \"abstract poetry filled with complicated wordplay, bone-dry wit, cutting social observations, and general misanthropy.\" The Fall have been called \"the most prolific band of the British post-punk movement.\" They have released thirty-one studio albums as of 2015, and more than three times that number when live albums and compilations (often released against Smith's wishes) are taken into account. While the Fall have never achieved widespread success beyond minor hit singles in the late 1980s, they have maintained a strong cult following. They were long associated with BBC disc jockey John Peel, who championed them from early on in their career. Peel described the Fall as his favourite band, famously explaining, \"they are always different; they are always the same.\""@en ;

dbr:The_Modern_Lovers	rdf:type	dbo:Band ;
	dbo:abstract	"The Modern Lovers were an American rock band led by Jonathan Richman in the 1970s and 1980s. The original band existed from 1970 to 1974 but their recordings were not released until 1976 or later. It featured Richman and bassist Ernie Brooks with drummer David Robinson (later of the Cars) and keyboardist Jerry Harrison (later of Talking Heads). The sound of the band owed a great deal to the influence of the Velvet Underground, and is now sometimes classed as \"protopunk\". It pointed the way towards much of the punk rock, new wave, alternative and indie rock music of later decades. Their only album, the eponymous The Modern Lovers, contained idiosyncratic songs about dating awkwardness, growing up in Massachusetts, and love of life and the USA. Later, between 1976 and 1988, Richman used the name Modern Lovers for a variety of backing bands, always billed as \"Jonathan Richman and the Modern Lovers\". These bands were quieter and featured more low-key, often near-childlike songs as Richman drew on folk-rock and other genres. Out of Richman's original bandmates, only Robinson was part of any of the other Modern Lovers incarnations."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"The Monkees are an American rock band that released music in their original incarnation between 1965 and 1971, with subsequent reunion albums and tours in the decades that followed. They were formed in Los Angeles in 1965 by Bob Rafelson and Bert Schneider for the American television series The Monkees, which aired from 1966 to 1968. The musical acting quartet was composed of Americans Micky Dolenz, Michael Nesmith and Peter Tork and Englishman Davy Jones. The band's music was initially supervised by producer Don Kirshner. Dolenz described the Monkees as initially being \"a TV show about an imaginary band ... that wanted to be the Beatles, [but] that was never successful\". The actor-musicians, however, soon became a real band.[citation needed] For the first few months of their initial five-year career as the Monkees, the four actor-musicians were allowed only limited roles in the recording studio. This was due in part to the amount of time required to film the television series. Nonetheless, Nesmith did compose and produce some songs from the beginning, and Peter Tork contributed limited guitar work on the sessions produced by Nesmith. They eventually fought for and earned the right to collectively supervise all musical output under the band's name. The sitcom was canceled in 1968, but the band continued to record music through 1971. A revival of interest in the television show came in 1986, which led to a series of reunion tours and new records. Up until 2011 the group had reunited and toured several times, with varying degrees of success. Despite the sudden death of Davy Jones on February 29, 2012, the surviving members reunited for a tour in November\u2013December 2012 and again in 2013 for a 24-date tour. The Monkees have sold more than 75 million records worldwide and had international hits, including \"Last Train to Clarksville\", \"Pleasant Valley Sunday\", \"Daydream Believer\" and \"I'm A Believer\". At their peak in 1967, the band outsold the Beatles and the Rolling Stones combined."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"The Pogues are a Celtic rock band from London, formed in 1982 and fronted by Shane MacGowan. The band reached international prominence in the 1980s and early 1990s. MacGowan left the band in 1991 due to drinking problems but the band continued first with Joe Strummer and then with Spider Stacy on vocals before breaking up in 1996. The band reformed in late 2001, and has been playing regularly ever since, on the US East Coast around St Patrick's Day and across the UK and Ireland. The group has yet to record any new music and, according to Spider Stacy on Pogues.com, has no inclination to do so. Their politically tinged music was informed by MacGowan and Stacy's punk backgrounds, yet used traditional Irish instruments such as the tin whistle, banjo, cittern, mandolin and accordion. The Pogues were founded in Kings Cross, a district of Central London, in 1982 as Pogue Mahone\u2014pogue mahone being the anglicisation of the Irish p\u00F3g mo th\u00F3in, meaning \"kiss my arse\".

For the majority of their history, the band consisted of Sting (lead singer, bassist and principal songwriter), Andy Summers (guitarist) and Stewart Copeland (drummer). The Police became globally popular in the late 1970s and are generally regarded as one of the first new wave groups to achieve mainstream success, playing a style of rock that was influenced by punk, reggae, and jazz. They are also considered one of the leaders of the Second British Invasion of the U.S. They disbanded in 1986, but reunited in early 2007 for a one-off world tour that ended in August 2008. Their 1978 debut album, Outlandos d'Amour, reached No. 6 in the UK, and their second album Reggatta de Blanc became the first of five consecutive UK No. 1 albums. Synchronicity from 1983 was No. 1 in both the UK and U.S., selling over 8 million copies in the U.S. alone. The Police have sold over 75 million records, making them one of the world's best-selling artists of all time. They were the world's highest-earning musicians in 2008, thanks to their reunion tour. The band has won a number of music awards throughout their career, including six Grammy Awards, two Brit Awards\u2014winning Best British Group once, an MTV Video Music Award, and in 2003 were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.

The band was composed of the guitarist and vocalist Paul Westerberg, guitarist Bob Stinson, bass guitarist Tommy Stinson and drummer Chris Mars for most of its career. Following several acclaimed albums, including Let It Be and Tim, Bob Stinson left the band in 1986, and Slim Dunlap joined as lead guitarist. Steve Foley replaced Mars in 1990. Towards the end of the band's career, Westerberg exerted more control over the creative output. The group disbanded in 1991, with the members ultimately pursuing various projects. A reunion was announced on October 3, 2012. The Replacements never had significant commercial success, except for \"I'll Be You\", which hit No. 1 on the Alt Rock Billboard listing, but they influenced numerous alternative rock acts. The Replacements' music was influenced by rock artists such as the Rolling Stones, Faces, Big Star, Slade, Badfinger, Lou Reed and the Beatles as well as punk rock bands such as the Ramones, Johnny Thunders, Dead Boys and the Clash. Unlike many of their underground contemporaries, the Replacements played \"heart-on-the-sleeve\" rock songs that combined Westerberg's \"raw-throated adolescent howl\" with self-deprecating lyrics. The Replacements were a notoriously wayward live act often performing under the influence of alcohol and playing fragments of covers instead of their own material."@en ;

dbr:The_Rolling_Stones	rdf:type	dbo:Band ;
	dbo:abstract	"The Rolling Stones are an English rock band formed in London in 1962. The first settled line-up consisted of Brian Jones (guitar, harmonica), Ian Stewart (piano), Mick Jagger (lead vocals, harmonica), Keith Richards (guitar), Bill Wyman (bass) and Charlie Watts (drums). Stewart was removed from the official line-up in 1963 but continued as an occasional pianist until his death in 1985. Jones departed the band less than a month prior to his death in 1969, having already been replaced by Mick Taylor, who remained until 1975. Subsequently, Ronnie Wood has been on guitar in tandem with Richards. Following Wyman's departure in 1993, Darryl Jones has been the main bassist. Other notable keyboardists for the band have included Nicky Hopkins, active from 1967 to 1982; Billy Preston through the mid 1970s (most prominent on Black and Blue) and Chuck Leavell, active since 1982. The band was first led by Jones but after teaming as the band's songwriters, Jagger and Richards assumed de facto leadership. The Rolling Stones were in the vanguard of the British Invasion of bands that became popular in the US in 1964\u201365. At first noted for their longish hair as much as their music, the band are identified with the youthful and rebellious counterculture of the 1960s. Critic Sean Egan states that within a year of the release of their 1964 debut album, they \"were being perceived by the youth of Britain and then the world as representatives of opposition to an old, cruel order \u2014 the antidote to a class-bound, authoritarian culture.\" They were instrumental in making blues a major part of rock and roll and of changing the international focus of blues culture to the original type blues typified by Chess Records artists such as Muddy Waters\u2014writer of \"Rollin' Stone\", after which the band is named. After a short period of musical experimentation that culminated with the polarising and largely psychedelic album Their Satanic Majesties Request (1967), the group returned to its bluesy roots with Beggars' Banquet (1968) which\u2014along with its follow-ups, Let It Bleed (1969), Sticky Fingers (1971) and Exile on Main St. (1972)\u2014is generally considered to be the band's best work and are considered the Rolling Stones' \"Golden Age\". It was during this period the band were first introduced on stage as \"The World's Greatest Rock and Roll Band\". Musicologist Robert Palmer attributed the \"remarkable endurance\" of the Rolling Stones to being \"rooted in traditional verities, in rhythm-and-blues and soul music\", while \"more ephemeral pop fashions have come and gone\". The band continued to release commercially successful records in the 1970s and sold many albums, with Some Girls (1978) and Tattoo You (1981) being their two most sold albums worldwide. In the 1980s, a feud between Jagger and Richards about the band's musical direction almost caused the band to split but they managed to patch their relationship up and had a successful comeback with Steel Wheels (1989), which was followed by a big stadium and arena tour. Since the 1990s, new recorded material from the group has been increasingly less well-received and less frequent. Despite this, the Rolling Stones have continued to be a huge attraction on the live circuit, with big stadium tours in the 1990s and 2000s. By 2007, the band had made what were then four of the top five highest-grossing concert tours of all time: Voodoo Lounge Tour (1994\u201395), Bridges to Babylon Tour (1997\u201398), Licks Tour (2002\u201303) and A Bigger Bang Tour (2005\u201307). The Rolling Stones were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1989, and the UK Music Hall of Fame in 2004. Rolling Stone magazine ranked them fourth on the \"100 Greatest Artists of All Time\" list, and their estimated sales are above 200 million. They have released twenty-nine studio albums, eighteen live albums and numerous compilations. Let It Bleed (1969) was their first of five consecutive number one studio and live albums in the UK. Sticky Fingers (1971) was the first of eight consecutive number one studio albums in the US. In 2013, the band ranked 10th on the Billboard Hot 100 All-Time Top Artists chart. In 2012, the band celebrated its 50th anniversary."@en ;

Formed by frontman Billy Corgan (lead vocals, guitar) and James Iha (guitar), the band included D'arcy Wretzky (bass guitar) and Jimmy Chamberlin (drums) in its original incarnation. It has undergone many line-up changes over the course of its existence, with the current lineup including Corgan, rhythm guitarist Jeff Schroeder and Chamberlin. Disavowing the punk rock roots of many of their alt-rock contemporaries, the Pumpkins have a diverse, densely layered, and guitar-heavy sound, containing elements of gothic rock, heavy metal, dream pop, psychedelic rock, progressive rock, shoegazing, and electronica in later recordings. Corgan is the group's primary songwriter\u2014his grand musical ambitions and cathartic lyrics have shaped the band's albums and songs, which have been described as \"anguished, bruised reports from Billy Corgan's nightmare-land\". The Smashing Pumpkins broke into the musical mainstream with their second album, 1993's Siamese Dream. The group built its audience with extensive touring and their 1995 follow-up, the double album Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness, which debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 album chart. With 20 million albums sold in the United States alone, The Smashing Pumpkins were one of the most commercially successful and critically acclaimed bands of the 1990s. However, internal fighting, drug use, and diminishing record sales led to a 2000 break-up. In 2006, Billy Corgan and Jimmy Chamberlin reconvened to record a new Smashing Pumpkins album, Zeitgeist. After touring throughout 2007 and 2008 with a lineup including new guitarist Jeff Schroeder, Chamberlin left the band in early 2009. Later that year, Corgan began a new recording series entitled Teargarden by Kaleidyscope featuring a rotating lineup of musicians, that has resulted in the albums Oceania (2012), Monuments to an Elegy (2014), and a forthcoming album. Chamberlin rejoined, originally temporarily, in 2015 for The End Times Tour, but remained a member of the band afterwards. As of 2016, Corgan, Chamberlin & Schroeder are the sole permanent band members."@en ;

They were one of the pioneering groups of the Madchester movement that was active during the late 1980s and early 1990s. The band's most successful lineup consists of vocalist Ian Brown, guitarist John Squire, bassist Mani, and drummer Reni. The band released their debut album, The Stone Roses, in 1989. The album was a breakthrough success for the band and garnered critical acclaim, with many critics regarding it as one of the greatest British albums ever recorded. At this time the group decided to capitalise on their success by signing to a major label. Their current record label, Silvertone, would not let them out of their contract, which led to a long legal battle that culminated with the band signing with Geffen Records in 1991. The Stone Roses then released their second album, Second Coming, which was met with lacklustre reviews in 1994. The group soon disbanded after several lineup changes throughout the supporting tour, which began with Reni first departing in late 1995, followed by Squire in April 1996. Brown and Mani dissolved the remains of the group in October 1996 following their appearance at the Reading Festival. Following much intensified media speculation, The Stone Roses called a press conference on 18 October 2011 to announce that the band had reunited and would perform a reunion tour of the world in 2012, including three homecoming shows in Heaton Park, Manchester. Plans to record a third album in the future were also floated. In June 2012, Chris Coghill, the writer of the new film which is set during the Stone Roses 1990 Spike Island show, revealed that the band \"have at least three or four new tracks recorded\". In June 2013, a documentary about the band's reformation directed by Shane Meadows and titled The Stone Roses: Made of Stone was released."@en ;

Beginning life as the Guildford Stranglers on 11 September 1974 in Guildford, Surrey, they originally built a following within the mid-1970s pub rock scene. While their aggressive, no-compromise attitude identified them as one of the instigators of the UK punk rock scene that followed, their idiosyncratic approach rarely followed any single musical genre and the group went on to explore a variety of musical styles, from new wave, art rock and gothic rock through the sophisticated pop of some of their 1980s output. They had major mainstream success with their single \"Golden Brown\". Their other hits include \"No More Heroes\", \"Peaches\", \"Always the Sun\" and \"Skin Deep\". The Stranglers' early sound was driven by Jean-Jacques Burnel's melodic bass, but also gave prominence to Dave Greenfield's keyboards. Their early music was also characterised by the growling vocals and sometimes misanthropic lyrics of both Jean-Jacques Burnel and Hugh Cornwell. Over time, their output gradually grew more refined and sophisticated. Summing up their contribution to popular music, critic Dave Thompson later wrote: \"From bad-mannered yobs to purveyors of supreme pop delicacies, the group was responsible for music that may have been ugly and might have been crude \u2013 but it was never, ever boring.\""@en ;

dbr:The_Undertones	rdf:type	dbo:Band ;
	dbo:abstract	"The Undertones are a punk rock/new wave band formed in Derry, Northern Ireland, in 1974. From 1975 to 1983, the Undertones consisted of Feargal Sharkey (vocals), John O'Neill (rhythm guitar, vocals), Damian O'Neill (lead guitar, vocals), Michael Bradley (bass, vocals) and Billy Doherty (drums). Although much of the earlier Undertones material drew influence from punk rock and new wave, the Undertones also incorporated elements of rock, glam rock and post-punk into material released after 1979, before citing soul and Motown as the influence for the material released upon their final album. The Undertones released thirteen singles and four studio albums between 1978 and 1983 before Sharkey announced his intention to leave the band in May 1983, citing musical differences as the reason for the break up. Despite the political climate in which the band had lived, the vast majority (though not all) of the material the band released focused not upon the Troubles, but upon issues such as adolescence, teenage angst and heartbreak. The merging of instruments has led AllMusic to state that guitarists John and Damian O'Neill \"mated infectious guitar hooks to 1960s garage, 1970s glam rock, and Feargal Sharkey's signature vocal quaver.\" In 1999, the Undertones reformed, replacing lead singer Feargal Sharkey with Paul McLoone. The Undertones remain the most successful band to have emerged from Derry, and one of the most successful bands to have emerged from Northern Ireland."@en ;

dbr:The_Who	rdf:type	dbo:Band ;
	dbo:abstract	"The Who are an English rock band that formed in 1964. Their classic line-up consisted of lead singer Roger Daltrey, guitarist Pete Townshend, bassist John Entwistle, and drummer Keith Moon. They are considered one of the most influential rock bands of the 20th century, selling over 100 million records worldwide and establishing their reputation equally on live shows and studio work. The Who developed from an earlier group, the Detours, and established themselves as part of the pop art and mod movements, featuring auto-destructive art by destroying guitars and drums on stage. Their first single as the Who, \"I Can't Explain\", reached the UK top ten, followed by a string of singles including \"My Generation\", \"Substitute\" and \"Happy Jack\". In 1967, they performed at the Monterey Pop Festival and released the US top ten single \"I Can See for Miles\", while touring extensively. The group's fourth album, 1969's rock opera Tommy, included the single \"Pinball Wizard\" and was a critical and commercial success. Live appearances at Woodstock and the Isle of Wight Festival, along with the live album Live at Leeds, cemented their reputation as a respected rock act. With their success came increased pressure on lead songwriter and visionary Townshend, and the follow-up to Tommy, Lifehouse, was abandoned. Songs from the project made up 1971's Who's Next, which included the hit \"Won't Get Fooled Again\". The group released the album Quadrophenia in 1973 as a celebration of their mod roots, and oversaw the film adaptation of Tommy in 1975. They continued to tour to large audiences before semi-retiring from live performances at the end of 1976. The release of Who Are You in 1978 was overshadowed by the death of Moon shortly after. Kenney Jones replaced Moon and the group resumed activity, releasing a film adaptation of Quadrophenia and the retrospective documentary The Kids Are Alright. After Townshend became weary of touring, the group split in 1982. The Who occasionally re-formed for live appearances such as Live Aid in 1985, a 25th anniversary tour in 1989 and a tour of Quadrophenia in 1996. They resumed regular touring in 1999, with drummer Zak Starkey. After Entwistle's death in 2002, plans for a new album were delayed. Townshend and Daltrey continued as the Who, releasing Endless Wire in 2006, and continued to play live regularly. The Who's major contributions to rock music include the development of the Marshall stack, large PA systems, use of the synthesizer, Entwistle and Moon's lead playing styles, Townshend's feedback and power chord guitar technique, and the development of the rock opera. They are cited as an influence by hard rock, punk rock and mod bands, and their songs still receive regular exposure."@en ;

Since 1995, Justin Chancellor has been the band's bassist, replacing their original bassist Paul D'Amour. Tool has won three Grammy Awards, performed worldwide tours, and produced albums topping the charts in several countries. The band emerged with a heavy metal sound on their first studio album, Undertow (1993), and later became a dominant act in the alternative metal movement, with the release of their second album, \u00C6nima in 1996. Their efforts to unify musical experimentation, visual arts, and a message of personal evolution continued, with Lateralus (2001) and the most recent album, 10,000 Days (2006), gaining the band critical acclaim, and commercial success around the world. Due to Tool's incorporation of visual arts and very long and complex releases, the band is generally described as a style-transcending act and part of progressive rock, psychedelic rock, and art rock. The relationship between the band and today's music industry is ambivalent, at times marked by censorship, and the band's insistence on privacy."@en ;

Weezer has sold 9.2 million albums in the US and over 17 million worldwide. After signing to Geffen Records in 1993, the band released its debut self-titled album, also known as The Blue Album, in 1994. Backed by successful music videos for the singles \"Buddy Holly\", \"Undone \u2013 The Sweater Song\" and \"Say It Ain't So\", The Blue Album became a triple-platinum success and received critical acclaim. Weezer's second album, Pinkerton (1996), featuring a darker, more abrasive sound, was a commercial failure and initially received mixed reviews, but went on to achieve cult status and critical acclaim years later. Both The Blue Album and Pinkerton are now frequently cited among the best albums of the 1990s. Following Pinkerton, bassist Matt Sharp left the band, and Weezer went on hiatus. In 2001, Weezer returned with another self-titled album, also known as The Green Album, with new bassist Mikey Welsh. Promoted by singles \"Hash Pipe\" and \"Island in the Sun\", The Green Album was a commercial success and received mostly positive reviews. After the album's release, Welsh left the band and was replaced by current bassist Scott Shriner. Weezer's fourth album, Maladroit, was released in May 2002 to mostly positive reviews, but did not match the sales of The Green Album. Weezer's fifth album, Make Believe, was released in May 2005; despite mixed reviews, its single \"Beverly Hills\" became Weezer's first single to top the US Modern Rock Tracks chart and the first to reach the top ten on the Billboard Hot 100. In June 2008, Weezer's third self-titled album, also known as The Red Album, featuring \"TR-808s, synths, Southern rap, and baroque counterpoint\", was released to mixed reviews. Its lead single, \"Pork and Beans\", became the band's third song to top the Modern Rock Tracks chart, backed by a successful YouTube music video. Weezer's seventh album Raditude (2009) and eighth album Hurley (2010), featuring more \"modern pop production\" and songs co-written with other artists, achieved further mixed reviews and moderate sales. The band's ninth album, Everything Will Be Alright in the End, was released in October 2014 to positive reviews. Weezer is set to release another self-titled album, also known as The White Album, on April 1, 2016."@en ;

Critic Stewart Mason wrote, \"Over their brilliant first three albums, Wire expanded the sonic boundaries of not just punk, but rock music in general.\" Wire are a definitive art punk and post-punk ensemble, mostly due to their richly detailed and atmospheric sound, often obscure lyrical themes, and, to a lesser extent, their Situationist political stance[citation needed]. The group exhibited a steady development from an early raucous punk style (1977's Pink Flag) to a more complex, structured sound involving increased use of guitar effects and synthesizers (1978's Chairs Missing and 1979's 154). The band gained a reputation for experimenting with song arrangements throughout its career."@en ;

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Yes_(band)>	rdf:type	dbo:Band ;
	dbo:abstract	"Yes are an English rock band formed in 1968 by bassist Chris Squire and singer Jon Anderson. Yes first achieved success in the 1970s with a progressive, art and symphonic style of rock music. They are distinguished by their use of mystical and cosmic lyrics, live stage sets, and lengthy compositions, often with complex instrumental and vocal arrangements. Nine of their twenty studio albums have reached the top ten in either the UK or US, with two reaching number one in the UK. They have sold 13.5 million certified units in the US. Nineteen people in total have been a part of the band's line-up, including Swiss, South African, American, Russian, and Canadian members. The band's most recent line-up consists of singer Jon Davison, guitarist Steve Howe, bass guitarist Billy Sherwood, keyboardist Geoff Downes, and drummer Alan White. Squire and guitarist Peter Banks had played together in The Syn and then Mabel Greer's Toyshop. Anderson and later drummer Bill Bruford joined a line-up of Mabel Greer's Toyshop, which evolved into Yes. Keyboardist Tony Kaye completed the first Yes lineup. The 1970s saw Yes release the albums widely viewed as their creative peak: The Yes Album, Fragile (both in 1971), Close to the Edge (1972), Tales from Topographic Oceans (1973), Relayer (1974) and Going for the One (1977). For most of this period, the band included Anderson, Squire, Howe (who replaced Banks in 1970), Rick Wakeman on keyboards and Bruford, or later Alan White, on drums; Kaye and Patrick Moraz each play keyboards on one of these albums. After the relative failure of Tormato (1978) and rise of punk rock, Anderson and Wakeman left in 1980; Squire, Howe and White recorded Drama with Downes and new vocalist Trevor Horn, both also members of The Buggles. Yes disbanded in 1981, with Howe and Downes subsequently creating Asia. Yes reformed in 1983 with Anderson, Squire, White, a returning Kaye, and singer and guitarist Trevor Rabin, adopting a more pop rock sound. This quickly became the most commercially successful Yes lineup with 90125 (1983), which spawned the US number one single \"Owner of a Lonely Heart\", and Big Generator (1987). The tour in support of Union (1991), which amalgamated members of Yes and Anderson Bruford Wakeman Howe, was a commercial success that featured an eight-man line-up (instead of a quintet). Subsequent albums and singles have sold less well. The band toured almost constantly between 1996 and 2004, including both 30th and 35th anniversary shows, also releasing the albums Keys to Ascension (1996), Keys to Ascension 2 (1997), Open Your Eyes (1997), The Ladder (1999), and Magnification (2001) during this period. After a four-year hiatus, Yes resumed touring, replacing Anderson with Beno\u00EEt David and Wakeman with his son Oliver Wakeman due to health issues. In 2011, they released Fly from Here featuring Downes, who returned on keyboards after 30 years. The following year David left the band due to illness and was replaced by Jon Davison of Glass Hammer. The band's twenty-first studio album Heaven & Earth, their first album with Davison, was released in July 2014. On 19 May 2015, Yes announced that due to leukemia, Squire was taking a leave from the band - for the first time in its history, with Sherwood, a former member as guitarist from 1997 to 2000, announced as his temporary replacement. Since Squire's death on 27 June 2015, Yes no longer features any original members."@en ;

In 1999, an attempt was made at a partial reunion of the progressive rock supergroup Asia involving John Wetton (bass, vocals), Carl Palmer (drums) and Geoff Downes (keys), with David Kilminster to be on guitar. However, Downes withdrew from plans, choosing to stick with John Payne in their Asia line-up. Wetton and Palmer instead formed Qango with Kilminster and John Young on keys (who had briefly replaced Downes in Asia in 1989). The band's live set was based on songs by Asia and Palmer's former band Emerson, Lake & Palmer. The band did not attract the same commercial interest as an Asia reunion. Two shows were planned for November 1999, but were cancelled as Wetton required a wrist operation. Instead, the band played five UK dates in February 2000 (including a London show on 4 February when Keith Emerson jammed with the band) and six in April 2000. Subsequent touring plans and ideas to record a studio album were abandoned, with Wetton and Palmer soon returning to their solo activities."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"The Go-Bang's were a three-piece Japanese girl band active in the late 1980s and early 1990s. They broke up in 1994, and since then, Kaori Moriwaka (singer/songwriter) has become a solo singer/songwriter/producer/actress, while Mitsuko Saito (drums) and Misa Tanishima (bass guitar) have dropped beneath the radar, though apparently Saito has been seen drumming for a few other bands, fashion-modeling and played a drummer as an extra in the music video of J-pop singer Namie Amuro's Please Smile Again. Initially a four-piece band, Go-Bang's lost their guitarist early on, becoming popular after she left the band. At the peak of their career, the album \"Greatest Venus\" went straight to the top of Oricon's Japanese album chart and stayed there for two consecutive weeks. They had a somewhat unusual sound, being a punk-influenced bubblegum pop band, and lacking a lead guitarist \u2014 though this wasn't always the case \u2014 on the album Samantha, for example, the Go-Bang's worked with the King Gang's, a three-piece all-male band, who complemented their line up with the addition of electric guitars and keyboard. The album Samantha was mixed down by Michael Haas, who was a recording engineer for British techno/house band 808 State, at Revolution Studio in Manchester, England. Also, the album's title song \"Samansa\" was reproduced as an English language song and remixed by John Waddel from Rhythm King Productions, who produced British pop singer/rap artist Betty Boo. This remix version of the song was released as one of the songs on their remix mini album \"Darrin.\" Making cheerful, bouncy music, with a slight punk edge, the Go-Bang's made an impact on the Japanese charts for a short while, but gradually faded into the background, and disappeared almost completely from the public conscious following their breakup. However, some bands, such as the Titan Go-Kings, have referred to them as influences on their music."@en ;

Other members were singer Brian Marnell, drummer Bill Gibson (later of Huey Lewis and the News, replaced by Paul Zahl), and Nick Buck, also a Hot Tuna veteran, on keyboards . The group is said to have taken its name from the medical condition known as supraventricular tachycardia.[by whom?] A more plausible explanation is that the name was taken from a model of bass guitar amplifier, the Ampeg Super Vacuum Tube. SVT recorded two singles in 1979, one EP in 1980, and one album, No Regrets, in 1981. They were one of the first bands ever to record on North America's first punk label. San Francisco's 415 Records released their single, Heart of Stone, in 1979. The group disbanded after both Zahl and Casady left to form Yanks with Jack Johnson and Owen Masterson.[when?] Casady later quit Yanks and was replaced by bassist Steve Aliment. Brian Marnell died in 1983. Casady's former Jefferson Airplane bandmate Marty Balin covered the song Heart of Stone on his album, Lucky in 1983."@en ;

Founded in 1992, the band originated in Newark, Delaware along with such other local bands of the period including Jake and the Stiffs, The Verge, Boy Sets Fire, Zen Guerilla and Smashing Orange. Heavily influenced by The Doors, My Bloody Valentine, Hawkwind, Bruce Haack, and Chrome, Spindrift's early stages were experimental and differed greatly from their present sound. In the summer of 2001, band members Kirpatrick Thomas, Joe Baluta and Zachary Hansen re-located to Los Angeles. The band re-formed to include Bobby Bones, Dave Koenig, Frankie \"Teardrop\" Emerson and Rob Campanella of The Brian Jonestown Massacre and Jason \u201CPlucky\u201D Anchondo of The Warlocks. Inspired by their new locale, the band began a new stylistic approach evoking the spirit of the Old West as mythologized by Western Cinema, Spaghetti Westerns in particular. In 2005, Kirpatrick Thomas along with filmmaker Mike Bruce began production on the psychedelic western independent feature film, The Legend Of God\u2019s Gun, inspired by the same classic Western Films that influenced their music, most often those directed by Sergio Leone and scored by Ennio Morricone. During this period (2005\u20132009), the lineup consisted of David Koenig on rhythm guitar and harmonica, Julie Patterson on vocals, organ, and lap steel, Jason \"Plucky\" Anchondo on drums, Henry Evans on double neck bass and baritone guitar, and Kirpatrick Thomas on vocals and guitar. Tours with Dead Meadow (Kirpatrick Thomas filled in for an ailing Jason Simons on guitar during one tour), The Black Angels, and The Dandy Warhols followed until November 2009 when the band suffered a major lineup change due to tour burnout and financial difficulties. It was around this time that Spindrift began performing electro-acoustic shows with a more intimate, stripped down campfire atmosphere under the name of \"Bluniform\" and \"Boy Scout Jamboree\" with Koenig and Thomas taking the lead harmonies and performing tunes written by the likes of the \"singing cowboys\" such as Johnny Western, Johnny Bond, Tex Ritter, The Louvin Brothers, Frankie Laine, The Sons of the Pioneers, and Rex Allen. Spindrift also began incorporating these songs into their regular set and on occasion, would play them live. This would prove to be a huge influence on their later years. In December 2009, Henry Evans and Kirpatrick Thomas began reforming and rebuilding Spindrift while rehearsing and writing new songs in the Gram Parsons death room at Joshua Tree Inn. Added were Luke Dawson (who was innkeeper at the time) on pedal steel and rhythm guitar, Sasha Vallely on vocals, organ, and Native American flute, and James Acton on autoharp, vocals, and drums. This current lineup performed at SXSW 2010, Psych Fest III, supported Black Mountain, and toured Europe for the first time with B.R.M.C. in May 2010. In December 2010 after a 7 week U.S. Tour and following a successful Kickstarter campaign, the band went in and tracked Classic Soundtracks Volume 1 at Hicksville Trailer Palace in Joshua Tree, CA."@en ;

After the Halifax group broke up, Doherty and Yanovsky formed The Mugwumps with Cass Elliot and Jim Hendricks. When that band ended, Yanovsky, with John Sebastian formed The Lovin' Spoonful while Doherty joined The Journeymen's John Phillips and his wife Michelle, to, later, along with Cass Elliot, form The Mamas & the Papas. LaCroix became an award-winning Toronto photographer and popular jazz vocalist.

They are signed to RCA Records globally and Columbia Records exclusively in the US. The style of their early work, including their debut album Count Your Blessings, has primarily been described as deathcore, but they started to adopt a more eclectic style of metalcore on subsequent albums. Furthermore, their latest album That's the Spirit marked a shift in their sound to less aggressive rock music styles. Bring Me the Horizon released their debut album Count Your Blessings in 2006. Upon release, the album was met with great polarisation amongst the public and critical disdain. The band began to break away from their controversial sound with Suicide Season (2008), which proved to be a creative, critical and commercial turning point for the band. Bring Me the Horizon then released their third album There Is a Hell, Believe Me I've Seen It. There Is a Heaven, Let's Keep It a Secret.

Iommi, owner of the Black Sabbath name, decided to call the touring group Heaven & Hell to differentiate the project from the Ozzy Osbourne-led Black Sabbath. The moniker was taken from the first Dio-fronted Black Sabbath album, Heaven and Hell. According to Iommi, the name change was made so that fans at concerts would not expect \"to hear \u201CIron Man\u201D and \u201CWar Pigs\u201D and all that... it\u2019s none of the old stuff, it\u2019s none of the Ozzy period.

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Blue_Merle_(band)>	rdf:type	dbo:Band ;
	dbo:abstract	"Blue Merle was an American band centered in Nashville, Tennessee. Their name comes from the lyrics of a Led Zeppelin song, Bron-Y-Aur Stomp from Led Zeppelin III, referring to a \"blue-eyed merle\" border collie dog. Their lead singer Luke Reynolds, has a voice that has been compared to those of Chris Martin and Dave Matthews. The band is also known for live renditions of the Talking Heads song Psycho Killer. The band was first formed when Luke Reynolds and Jason Oettel met and began to work together. A friend in a studio offered them some recording time, and they began recording several demo tracks. While they were doing so, the President of Sony Publishing happened to be there, and offered them a contract. While they passed on it, it was a start. Reynolds then met Beau Stapleton, a Mandolin player, on his way back to his home in Vermont and invited him to join. Oettel brought one of his own friends, William Ellis, a drummer into the band as well. It was William who came up with the band's name. The last member to join was Luke Bulla, a fiddle player, who had been asked to fill in for a couple weeks, and soon was a full-time member. In February 2005, Blue Merle released Burning In The Sun, which features the singles \"Burning In The Sun\", \"Every Ship Must Sail Away\", and \"Lucky To Know You\". The album hit #8 on the Billboard Heatseekers chart and peaked at #199 on the Billboard 200. Blue Merle played Lollapalooza in 2005, and toured with Guster, Jem, J.J. Cale, and Badly Drawn Boy. In April 2006, the band broke up. They played their last show, 45 minute set, on Friday, April 21 at Vanderbilt University's Rites of Spring music festival along with Clap Your Hands Say Yeah and My Morning Jacket. Since the band's breakup, Luke Reynolds released two solo EPs entitled The Space Between the Lines and Maps. Beau Stapleton also released a solo EP, Will I Shine For You Still. Luke Reynolds's latest project, Pictures and Sound, released their self-titled debut album August 19, 2008 on Vanguard Records. In August 2008, NBC used Blue Merle's song \"Burning in the Sun\" during a feature on the Women's Pole Vault during the Beijing Olympics. The song \"If I Could\" was also prominently featured in the Friday Night Lights episode \"Let's Get It On\" (first aired Nov 2 2007). \"Every Ship Must Sail Away\" was the final song in Season 1, Episode 2 of the TV series \"Bones\"."@en ;

Douglas P. now lives in Australia. Over the band's three decades of existence, they have made numerous shifts in style and presentation, resulting in an overall shift from initial post-punk and Industrial Records influence to a more acoustic and folk music-oriented approach. They are sometimes considered controversial (largely due to usage of themes and imagery relating to Nazi Germany). Douglas P.'s influence was instrumental in sparking neofolk, of which his music has subsequently become a part."@en ;

The band was formed in 2000 and stayed active until 2005. They released a lot of material, particularly the full-length album, The Gospel According to the Studdogs and the 7\" vinyl 3-song EP, and gained local and national notoriety. They were featured in several national music magazines, including Magnet and Amplifier. Comparisons were made to the Stooges, Dead Boys, and it was said they sounded \"like absolute victory by way of slurring, Rolling Stones-y garage rock from nowhere in particular.\" Their drunken, abrasive live shows often ended with someone bleeding or being thrown out of the venue. Their live shows were said to be \"what Howling Wolf would sound like through a wall of noise and distortion.\" The band was signed by Orange Recordings in Los Angeles and toured all over the country, sharing bills with the Demolition Doll Rods, Bob Log III, The Fleshtones, and Immortal Lee County Killers and a one-time show with the Suicide Girls Burlesque Tour in Orlando. While in the Studdogs, Rich Evans began promoting concerts under the tag Mutiny Productions. He now heads the independent Florida's Dying label, promoting and releasing material from the Florida-underground music scene. Kyle Justin joined the band on drums in early 2002 to replace Jason, who was moving to Texas. Kyle vacated his position as drummer in 2003 to pursue a music career in Los Angeles. Eric Gebhardt left the band in 2005 to pursue a solo career under the alias Red Mouth."@en ;

Former Led Zeppelin lead singer Robert Plant formed the group in 1981 to satisfy his long-time goal in having a rock band with a heavy rhythm and blues basis. Formed originally in Worcestershire, the band went on to record an EP in the US. In addition to Plant, the band was composed of fellow former Led Zeppelin member Jimmy Page; Jeff Beck (a former Yardbirds member like Page); and other friends and well-known studio musicians. They performed in a concert at Keele University in 1981. The band released only one recording, an EP titled The Honeydrippers: Volume One, on 12 November 1984. The Honeydrippers peaked at #3 in early 1985 on the Billboard Hot 100 with a remake of the Phil Phillips' tune \"Sea of Love\", and hit the top 30 with \"Rockin' at Midnight\", originally a Roy Brown recording and a rewrite of \"Good Rockin' Tonight.\" With the EP's success, Plant stated that a full album would be recorded, but it never was. The band appeared on Saturday Night Live on 15 December 1984, performing \"Rockin' at Midnight\" and \"Santa Claus Is Back in Town.\" The band featured Brian Setzer on guitar, Tom Barney on bass, Paul Shaffer on piano, Buddy Williams on drums, Michael Brecker, Lou Marini, and Ronnie Cuber on saxophones, Jon Faddis on trumpet and Tom Malone on trombone. On 23 December 2006, Plant performed a charity show at Kidderminster Town Hall under the title 'The Return of the Honeydrippers' to raise money for his neighbour Jackie Jennings, who was undergoing treatment for a brain tumor."@en ;

The band had varied line-ups; only drummer Keith Guster was a member throughout their history. They finally disbanded in 1969.

Fleur de Lys were managed by Atlantic Records' Frank Fenter, who had also discovered Sharon Tandy, the first white artist to record for Stax Records. Sweet Feeling's manager Howard Conder recruited the band to record the song \"Reflections of Charles Brown\", under the name 'Rupert's People'. This single, heavily reminiscent of Procol Harum's \"A Whiter Shade of Pale\", failed to chart (except in Australia where it reached No. 13 in August 1967) despite receiving airplay but became a collectable item according to Record Collector Magazine (Issue c. 1992). The band recorded a B-side, \"Hold On\" which was their last work with Conder. Jimmy Page produced their first single and co-produced their second release with Glyn Johns. In 1966 Chas Chandler added Jimi Hendrix to a song they had recorded in London called Amen. They are featured on Hip Young Guitar Slinger and other reissues of 1960s British rock.

The band originally started when Bettencourt released the album Population 1 in 2002 (late 2001 in Japan). On the album, he recorded all the instruments on most of the tracks. When he decided to go on tour to support the album, he formed a touring band with Joe Pessia on rhythm guitar, Steve Ferlazzo on keyboards and back-up vocals, Philip Bynoe on bass and Kevin Figueiredo on drums. Later Phil left and Joe took the role of bassist. In 2004, while still under the moniker of Population 1, they released an EP titled Sessions from Room 4. In 2005, due to legal issues, Bettencourt dropped the name Population 1 and changed it to Dramagods with the same lineup. Dramagods released their debut effort Love in December 2005, available as an import via Victor Entertainment (Japan). The band then made their record available as a digital download on iTunes in early 2006. The band toured in Japan, where they appeared at the Udo Music Festival along with KISS, Santana, Jeff Beck, The Doobie Brothers, Alice in Chains, The Pretenders, Ben Folds Five, and others in July 2006 shortly after Bettencourt took part in a three-date reunion tour with Extreme in New England. In the autumn of 2006, DramaGods contributed their song \"S'OK\" to the album project Artists for Charity - Guitarists 4 the Kids, produced by Slang Productions to assist World Vision Canada in helping underprivileged kids in need. In early 2007 Dramagods started to dissolve when Nuno, Steve and Kevin became a part of Perry Farrell's musical venture Satellite Party which released one record (Ultra Payloaded). During the subsequent tour, they ended up quitting the band by July 2007 when Nuno and Gary Cherone reformed Extreme, making it a definitive reunion.

The band primarily consisted of vocalist Chrissy Amphlett and guitarist Mark McEntee. Amphlett garnered widespread attention for performing on stage in a school uniform and fishnet stockings, and often used an illuminated neon tube as a prop for displaying aggression towards both band members and the audience.Originally a five-piece, the band underwent numerous line-up changes, with Amphlett and McEntee remaining as core members, before its dissolution in 1996. In May 2001, the Australasian Performing Right Association (APRA), as part of its 75th Anniversary celebrations, named \"Science Fiction\" as one of the Top 30 Australian songs of all time. The band was inducted into the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) Hall of Fame in 2006 and in late 2007 Amphlett and McEntee reconvened to record a new single and begin working on a new album. The band played a short series of live gigs in Australia in late 2007 and early 2008. Divinyls released five studio albums\u2014four placed in the Top 10 Australian chart, while one (Divinyls) reached No. 15 in the United States (US).

Aged 53 years, Amphlett died on 21 April 2013 at her home in New York City, USA, after a protracted battle with breast cancer.

They are best known for their #1 US dance hit, \"Cherchez La Femme/C'est si bon\", from their self-titled debut album. The band was conceived by half-brothers Stony Browder and Thomas \"August Darnell\" Browder, with the former writing music and the latter lyrics. They started the band in 1974 with singer Cory Daye, drummer Mickey Sevilla, and percussionist Andy Hernandez (Coati Mundi). They released three albums between 1976 and 1979. Their music blended disco beats with rhythms from genres including calypso, rhumba, cha-cha-ch\u00E1, and compas. The Browders, who were both multiracial, wrote songs embracing multiculturalism over stories about tragic mulattoes. A smaller lineup known as Dr Buzzard's Savannah Band (omitting the word \"original\") also released a fourth album in 1984. They were frequent performers at Studio 54. Darnell and Hernandez went on to form Kid Creole and the Coconuts and Elbow Bones and the Racketeers. Daye also pursued a successful solo career. Their 1976 song, \"Sunshower\", has been sampled by a number of artists, including A Tribe Called Quest, M.I.A., Ghostface Killah, De La Soul, and Doug E. Fresh. It was remixed by Japanese recording artist Fantastic Plastic Machine. It was remixed by Korean musical group The Green Tea. It was featured in the 1991 film, Boyz n the Hood. The song \"Cherchez La Femme\" was covered by Gloria Estefan on her 1994 Hold Me, Thrill Me, Kiss Me album and was covered by rapper Ghostface Killah in 2000, as \"Cherchez LaGhost\" on his Supreme Clientele album."@en ;

The album, which followed the success of 50 Cent's major-label debut Get Rich or Die Tryin', served as a platform for Banks, Buck and Yayo to release their respective solo debut albums, The Hunger for More (2004), Straight Outta Cashville (2004), Thoughts of a Predicate Felon (2005) and The Documentary (2005). In 2008, the group released their second album T\u00B7O\u00B7S (Terminate on Sight). During Tony Yayo's imprisonment, the group recruited Tennessee-based rapper Young Buck, who was featured throughout the Beg for Mercy album. In late 2004, California-based rapper The Game was also added to the group, a proposition made by Dr. Dre and Jimmy Iovine, to promote the Aftermath/Interscope newcomer. However, due to The Game's \"disloyalty\" in the eyes of 50 Cent, he was soon removed from the group. In April 2008, 50 Cent revealed Young Buck was no longer a part of the group due to his \"excessive spending\" and \"inconsistent behavior\". In early 2014, after Yayo and 50 Cent separately stated G Unit was no more, the original members of the group reconciled and reunited at Summer Jam 2014, along with Young Buck after his six-year departure from the group.

The band was known for the complexity and sophistication of its music and for the varied musical skills of its members. All of the band members, except Malcolm Mortimore, were multi-instrumentalists. Although not commercially successful, they did achieve a cult following. The band's onetime stated aim was to \"expand the frontiers of contemporary popular music at the risk of becoming very unpopular\", although this stance was to alter significantly with time. Gentle Giant's music was considered complex even by progressive rock standards, drawing on a broad swath of music including folk, soul, jazz, and classical music. Unlike many of their progressive rock contemporaries, their \"classical\" influences ranged beyond the Romantic and incorporated medieval, baroque, and modernist chamber music elements. The band also had a taste for broad themes for their lyrics, drawing inspiration not only from personal experiences but from philosophy and the works of both Fran\u00E7ois Rabelais and R. D. Laing. In 2015 they were recognised with the lifetime achievement award at the Progressive Music Awards."@en ;

dbr:Steely_Dan	rdf:type	dbo:Band ;
	dbo:abstract	"Steely Dan is an American jazz rock band whose music also blends elements of funk, R&B, and pop. Founded by core members Walter Becker and Donald Fagen in 1972, the band enjoyed great critical and commercial success in the late 1970s and early 1980s before breaking up in 1981. Rolling Stone has called them \"the perfect musical antiheroes for the Seventies\". Steely Dan reunited in 1993 and has toured steadily ever since. Recorded with a revolving cast of session musicians, Steely Dan's music is characterized by complex jazz-influenced structures and harmonies. Becker and Fagen are whimsical, often sarcastic lyricists, having written \"cerebral, wry and eccentric\" songs about drugs, love affairs, gambling, and crime. The pair is also known for their near-obsessive perfectionism in the recording studio: Over the year they took to record Gaucho (1980), an album of just seven songs, Becker and Fagen hired at least 42 studio musicians and 11 engineers. Steely Dan toured from 1972 to 1974 before retiring from live performances, becoming a studio-only band. After the group disbanded in 1981, Becker and Fagen were less active throughout most of the next decade, though a cult following remained devoted to the group. Since reuniting in 1993 Steely Dan has released two albums of new material, the first of which, Two Against Nature, earned a Grammy Award for Album of the Year. They have sold more than 40 million albums worldwide and were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in March 2001. In a VH1 list of the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time, Steely Dan were listed at #82."@en ;

Recorded on 11 December 1968, this was the first time since the formation of the Beatles that Lennon, who was still in the group, had performed in public without them. The Dirty Mac recorded a rendition of the Lennon-penned Beatles track \"Yer Blues\" and then went on to back up Yoko Ono and violinist Ivry Gitlis on a track called \"Whole Lotta Yoko\" (essentially an extended blues jam on top of which Ono improvised free-form vocalizations). The name, thought of by Lennon, was a play on \"Fleetwood Mac\" who at that time were a very popular band in the United Kingdom. When asked what type of guitar amp Lennon would like to use for the performance his answer was \"One that plays\". In 1996, The Rolling Stones Rock and Roll Circus, the album of the event, was issued, concurrently with a home video of the event. The DVD issue followed in 2004."@en ;

The Paperboys blend Celtic folk with bluegrass, Mexican, Eastern European, African, zydeco, soul and country influences. The band has had a variety of members & line-ups since its original formation, with Landa remaining as the sole founding member, although veteran banjoist/bassist Cam Salay often returns as a guest performer. Known for consistently creating pop songs with melodic hooks, their music has been called versatile, with a wide range of influences, melding diverse musical influences more successfully than some other Irish rock bands have previously. Their first studio album, Late As Usual, was released in 1995, with their most recent release being their seventh album, 2014's At Peace With One's Ghost's. Their first three studio albums have received Juno Award nominations, with 1997's Molinos winning for the Roots and Traditional Album of the Year category, and also winning a West Coast Music Award the same year. Their album Postcards won a West Coast Music Award in 2000. The Paperboys have their own record label and production companies, Stompy Discs and Stomp Productions, which they created to produce and market their work themselves, beginning with their first album. After the death of original drummer Paul Lawton, The Paperboys helped to finance a scholarship in his name. The band has also appeared in and scored award-winning international films. They are noted for their version of Bob Dylan's \"All Along the Watchtower\", which was part of a tribute album to Dylan's 60th birthday. A staple at folk, roots, and bluegrass festivals in North America and Europe, The Paperboys have extensively toured both continents, performing in England, Germany, Switzerland, Norway, Scotland, Ireland, France, and Austria.

The group was formed in 1981 by university students Yuenyong Opakul (Aed) and Kirati Promsaka Na Sakon Nakhon (Keo or Khiao) who met while studying at Map\u00FAa Institute of Technology in the Philippines. The word carabao Tagalog means \"buffalo\", a symbol of fighting, hard work, and patience. They are known for their Phleng phuea chiwit (\u0E40\u0E1E\u0E25\u0E07\u0E40\u0E1E\u0E37\u0E48\u0E2D\u0E0A\u0E35\u0E27\u0E34\u0E15) or 'songs for life'. This kind of music came to prominence through the protest songs of the 1970s political upheaval in Thailand, especially from the band Caravan. Carabao have blended the acoustic/folk style of 'peua chiwit' with other forms of Thai music, western rock and country music, and various kinds of world music like Latin music and reggae, earning such labels as 'ethnic rockers' and 'Kings of 3Cha' or 'Rolling Stones of Asia'. MTV Asia calls them \"veteran\". Carabao's songs often tackle social and political issues, demanding social justice and taking on the causes of the ordinary Thai people, but they have also created love songs and more philosophical songs that carry messages for people everywhere. Lead singer/songwriter Aed Carabao is loved by many and is also famous for his sharp tongue and open criticism of corrupt politicians, big business, and environmental destruction. At least one or two songs on most albums up to the mid-'90s were banned by the government and coverage of the band rarely appeared on government TV and radio stations. Despite this, Carabao is the most popular Thai rock group of all time. Carabao reached cult status long ago and is now one of the most successful legendary rock groups in the world. They have been compared to the rock band U2."@en ;

The band originally formed in 2007 as Inflikted but changed its name for legal reasons. The group's creation marked the end of a 10-year feud between the Cavalera brothers who founded Sepultura in the early 1980s. Following the brothers' falling out, Max had formed a new band, Soulfly, and Igor had recorded four studio albums with Sepultura before leaving the band in January 2006. In July 2006, Max received an unexpected call from his brother, and by the end of the conversation, Max had invited Igor to visit him in Phoenix, Arizona, to perform in a Soulfly show. Igor joined Soulfly in concert and performed two Sepultura songs. After the show, Max suggested they begin a new project, and Igor accepted. To complete the band, Max chose Soulfly guitarist Marc Rizzo and the Gojira frontman Joe Duplantier to play bass guitar. The group then recorded their debut album at Undercity Studios in Los Angeles with engineer and co-producer Logan Mader in July 2007. Named after the band's original moniker, Inflikted was released through Roadrunner Records on 25 March 2008."@en ;

The band was formed in 1996 by Wednesday 13, who recruited friends and former Maniac Spider Trash bandmates Seaweed and Sicko Zero. The band's history is riddled with a 'revolving door' lineup with 13 the only member to have never been replaced. After breaking up in 2001 when Wednesday 13 left to perform vocals with the Murderdolls, the band reformed for a brief reunion in 2005, releasing a box set containing their entire recordings except for the track \"Look Mom I Killed A Chicken\" because Wednesday 13's master copy was \"destroyed beyond repair\". This track is exclusively available on the 197666 7-inch LP and the band-released \"Chop of My Hand\" CD-R. The music of the Frankenstein Drag Queens was played in a punk rock style. Lyrically the band were inspired by horror B-movies and references in popular culture. As well as a large leaning towards punk the band's live show and appearance took cues from glam rock acts such as Alice Cooper, New York Dolls and KISS. They were known to wear dresses and make-up on stage as part of their performance."@en ;

dbr:Jake_White_Project	rdf:type	dbo:Band ;
	dbo:abstract	"The Jake White Project was a short-lived New Jersey band that recorded three albums between 2004 and 2006. The Jake White Project (aka JWP) was formed in 2004 in Whippany, New Jersey. It was the brainchild of Jake White, a songwriter from Millburn, New Jersey who had previously played in local bands Blue Eclipse and Stinson. He was joined by two high school friends; guitarist Doug Atkins and drummer Karim Faris, along with guitarist Greg Sierpowski and keyboardist Faris Faris (brother of Karim). Once recording commenced, singer-songwriter Liliana Rose sang a few songs on the debut. The band's first album, Recreation, was released in June 2004. Shortly before the album tour, Sandra Myers took over as female lead vocalist. JWP members Jake White and Faris Faris were contracted to write songs for two independent movie releases by film company New Generation Cinema in 2004.[1] In May 2005, the band released its sophomore effort, Southbound, followed by another summer tour. After the tour, both Faris brothers, Atkins, and Myers left the group. White and Sierpowski acted as a duo in making the third (and final) Jake White Project album, On My Own, in June 2006. Following the release of the album, the group formally disbanded. White and Sierpowski both went on to record their respective solo material. Atkins now plays with up and coming singer/songwriter Jessica Rose and DiTaranto is with New York metal band Forsakken."@en ;

dbr:Larrikin_Love	rdf:type	dbo:Band ;
	dbo:abstract	"Larrikin Love were an English four piece indie rock band from London. Consisting of Edward \"Larrikin\" Leeson (vocals), Micko Larkin (guitar), Alfie Ambrose (bass) and Coz Kerrigan (drums), and also occasionally including violinist Rob Skipper from The Holloways or roving violinist Jonnie Fielding, the band were briefly described as being part of a Thamesbeat scene by the NME, a scene which is now widely accepted as having never really existed. They experiment with many different styles of music including punk, reggae, calypso, and bluegrass, and tend to add something of an Irish folk flavour to the typical indie rock sound, While often compared musically to bands such as The Clash, The Pogues and The Libertines, the band drew many of their lyrical influences from literature, including writers such as Rimbaud, Wilde and Orwell. After releasing their first two singles on the independent labels Young and Lost Club and Transgressive Records respectively, the band signed to Warner as part of a 'consultancy deal' between Warner and Transgressive. The band released their debut album, The Freedom Spark on 25 September 2006. On 4 May 2007 it was announced that the band had split up, shortly prior to the release of their debut album in continental Europe. Following the split of the band, Leeson formed the short-lived Pan I Am and Sunless '97. Larkin moved to LA, where he worked with Courtney Love before becoming part of a reformed Hole. Ambrose joined Gaoler's Daughter, and Kerrigan joined his brother Fiachra's band Marner Brown, who later changed their name to K."@en ;

dbr:The_Von_Bondies	rdf:type	dbo:Band ;
	dbo:abstract	"The Von Bondies was an American alternative rock band active from 1997 to 2011. The original line-up formed at the 1997 Cramps/Guitar Wolf show by Jason Stollsteimer and Marcie Bolen. They went through a variety of member changes and band names, including The Baby Killers, before settling on The Von Bondies in 2000. Don Blum joined the band around 1999 after attending numerous Baby Killers shows, while Leann Banks was picked via an audition. The Von Bondies got their break by playing a New Year's Eve show in Detroit, Michigan in 2000. In attendance at the show was Long Gone John, owner of the Sympathy for the Record Industry label. This led to Sympathy releasing the band's debut album Lack of Communication in 2001. In 2003, the band released the live Raw and Rare through Dim Mak Records, which was followed by their 2004 breakthrough release, Pawn Shoppe Heart, on Sire Records. Pawn Shoppe was produced by Jerry Harrison of Talking Heads and co-produced by Stollsteimer. The album reached a peak of No. 36 in the UK Albums Chart, and No. 8 on Billboard's Top Heatseekers chart and stayed in that chart for eight weeks. The hit single from this release was \"C'mon C'mon\", which reached No. 25 on the Billboard Alternative Songs chart and garnered national radio play. A shortened version of \"C'mon C'mon\" was the theme song to the TV series Rescue Me and was performed live by the band in Michael Winterbottom's film 9 Songs. MLB Network also uses a brief clip of the song as the opening of their show 30 Clubs in 30 Days. In 2008, the band signed with indie label Majordomo Records, joining label mates The Airborne Toxic Event and Earlimart. Their label debut, Love, Hate and Then There's You, was released in February 2009 featuring the single \"Pale Bride\". Known as a touring act, The Von Bondies have headlined tours of the United Kingdom/Europe, Australia, and the United States, taking along supporting bands like The Kills, Kasabian, Franz Ferdinand, Modey Lemon, SSM, The Subways, The Stills, Hot Panda and The Donnas. They have also appeared on Late Show with David Letterman, Last Call with Carson Daly and CD:UK. The group disbanded in July 2011. Its lineup at the time was Jason Stollsteimer on vocals and lead guitar, Christy Hunt on rhythm guitar and Leann Banks on bass guitar."@en ;

ns31:Carthy	rdf:type	dbo:Band ;
	dbo:abstract	"Waterson:Carthy are an English folk group originally comprising Norma Waterson on vocals, her husband Martin Carthy on guitar and vocals and their daughter Eliza Carthy on fiddle and vocals. They have a repertoire of predominantly British traditional songs and tunes but also occasionally perform contemporary songs from various sources. Their instrumentation is based largely around Martin Carthy's guitar, Eliza Carthy's fiddle and the melodeons of Saul Rose (1996\u20132000 and 2007-date) and Tim Van Eyken (2000\u20132007) with other instruments regularly augmenting their recordings. The group also continue the strong unaccompanied vocal tradition established by Norma and Martin's previous family group The Watersons, from whom they are widely considered to have evolved. The group's first album Waterson:Carthy (1994) was performed largely as a trio, with notable contributions from Eliza's musical partner Nancy Kerr. Their second album Common Tongue (1996) featured a more diverse selection of guest musicians with significant contributions from melodeon player Saul Rose. Although at this stage Rose was not credited as a full group member he soon became a permanent member of the touring group and was credited as a full group member on the release of their third album Broken Ground (1999). Rose left shortly thereafter to take up a career in the pharmaceutical industry and was replaced by Tim van Eyken in 2000. This line-up went on to release the albums A Dark Light (2002) and Fishes & Fine Yellow Sand (2004) and to consolidate the group's reputation as an outstanding live band. Holy Heathens and the Old Green Man (2006), an album of seasonal songs on which they were joined by vocal trio The Devil's Interval (Jim Causley, Lauren McCormick & Emily Portman) was widely considered both a belated follow-up and an addendum to The Watersons' Frost & Fire (1965). The group had already re-established The Watersons' tradition of performing a pre-Christmas tour under the Frost & Fire banner and by December 2006 this had been expanded to include a Mummers Play, brass section and a more significant contribution from The Devil's Interval. Van Eyken had announced his intention to leave the group to concentrate on his solo career prior to the December 2006 tour and his eventual final show was a Waterson Family special performance on 12 May 2007 London's Royal Albert Hall. Saul Rose, having again taken up music full-time in May 2006, immediately rejoined and the group began touring again in June 2007. All four members of Waterson:Carthy continue to conduct successful careers outside the group. Norma Waterson has released several solo albums and performs in an occasional duo with Martin Carthy. Martin Carthy is a member of Brass Monkey, performs in occasional duos with Dave Swarbrick, John Kirkpatrick and Eliza Carthy, and has a successful solo career stretching back over forty years. Eliza Carthy has a successful solo career and performs in an occasional duo with Saul Rose. Saul performs with various ensembles including Faustus, Random, Morris Offspring and Dansaul. Martin, Norma and Eliza all occasionally perform with Blue Murder. Individually, Martin, Norma and Eliza have won or been nominated several times in the BBC Radio 2 Folk Awards and Waterson:Carthy won awards for Best Group and Best Traditional Track (Raggle Taggle Gypsy) in 2000."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Frente! /fr\u025Bnte\u026A/ (or Frente) are an Australian alternative rock and folk-pop group which originally formed in 1989. The original line-up consisted of Simon Austin on guitar and backing vocals, Angie Hart on lead vocals, Tim O'Connor on bass guitar (later replaced by Bill McDonald), and Mark Picton on drums (later replaced by Alastair Barden, then by Pete Luscombe). In August 1991 they issued their debut extended play, Whirled, which included the track, \"Labour of Love\". In March 1992 they released a second EP, Clunk, with its featured track, \"Ordinary Angels\", which peaked at No. 3 on the ARIA Singles Chart. It was followed in October by \"Accidentally Kelly Street\" (initially misspellt as \"Accidently Kelly Street\") which reached No. 4. Their debut album, Marvin the Album, issued in November, peaked at No. 5 on the ARIA Albums Chart. \"Labour of Love\" was released as an EP outside of Australasia in 1994 as a CD single with a cover version of New Order's \"Bizarre Love Triangle\" included. The Australian rock music historian Ian McFarlane felt that the group's \"quirky, irreverent, acoustic-based sound was at odds with the usual guitar-heavy, grunge trends of the day. The band's presentation had a tweeness about it that could have been off-putting if not for its genuine freshness and honesty\".[citation needed]"@en ;
