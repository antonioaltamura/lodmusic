	dbo:abstract	"Michael \"Dodo\" Marmarosa (December 12, 1925 \u2013 September 17, 2002) was an American jazz pianist, composer, and arranger. Originating in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, Marmarosa became a professional musician in his mid-teens, and toured with several major big bands, including those led by Tommy Dorsey, Gene Krupa, and Artie Shaw into the mid-1940s. He moved to Los Angeles in 1945, where he became increasingly interested and involved in the emerging bebop scene. During his time on the West Coast, he recorded in small groups with leading bebop and swing musicians, including Howard McGhee, Charlie Parker, and Lester Young, as well as leading his own bands. Marmarosa returned to Pittsburgh due to health reasons in 1948. He began performing much less frequently, and had a presence only locally for around a decade. Friends and fellow musicians had commented from an early stage that Marmarosa was an unusual character. His mental stability was probably affected by being beaten into a coma when in his teens, by a short-lived marriage followed by permanent separation from his children, and by a traumatic period in the army. He made comeback recordings in the early 1960s, but soon retreated to Pittsburgh, where he played occasionally into the early 1970s. From then until his death three decades later, he lived with family and in veterans' hospitals."@en .

The historian Stephen Pile ranked her \"the world's worst opera singer\". \"No one, before or since,\" he wrote, \"has succeeded in liberating themselves quite so completely from the shackles of musical notation.\" Despite (or perhaps because of) her technical incompetence, she became a prominent musical cult figure in New York City during the 1920s, '30s, and '40s. Cole Porter, Enrico Caruso, Gian Carlo Menotti, Lily Pons, Sir Thomas Beecham, and other celebrities were fans. The poet William Meredith wrote that what Jenkins provided \" ... was never exactly an aesthetic experience, or only to the degree that an early Christian among the lions provided aesthetic experience; it was chiefly immolatory, and Madame Jenkins was always eaten, in the end.\u201D"@en .

Horne's career spanned over 70 years appearing in film, television, and theater. Horne joined the chorus of the Cotton Club at the age of 16 and became a nightclub performer before moving to Hollywood, where she had small parts in numerous movies, and more substantial parts in the 1943 films Cabin in the Sky and Stormy Weather. Because of the Red Scare and her political activism, Horne found herself blacklisted and unable to get work in Hollywood. Returning to her roots as a nightclub performer, Horne took part in the March on Washington in August 1963, and continued to work as a performer, both in nightclubs and on television, while releasing well-received record albums. She announced her retirement in March 1980, but the next year starred in a one-woman show, Lena Horne: The Lady and Her Music, which ran for more than three hundred performances on Broadway. She then toured the country in the show, earning numerous awards and accolades. Horne continued recording and performing sporadically into the 1990s, disappearing from the public eye in 2000. Horne died of congestive heart failure on May 9, 2010 at the age of 92."@en ;

He and his identical twin brother, double bassist Addison Farmer, started playing professionally while in high school. Art gained greater attention after the release of a recording of his composition \"Farmer's Market\" in 1952. He subsequently moved from Los Angeles to New York, where he performed and recorded with musicians such as Horace Silver, Sonny Rollins, and Gigi Gryce and became known principally as a bebop player. As Farmer's reputation grew, he expanded from bebop into more experimental forms through working with composers such as George Russell and Teddy Charles. He went on to join Gerry Mulligan's quartet and, with Benny Golson, to co-found the Jazztet. Continuing to develop his own sound, Farmer switched from trumpet to the warmer flugelhorn in the early 1960s, and he helped to establish the flugelhorn as a soloist's instrument in jazz. He settled in Europe in 1968 and continued to tour internationally until his death. Farmer recorded more than 50 albums under his own name, a dozen with the Jazztet, and dozens more with other leaders.

	dbo:abstract	"Charles Kent \"Charlie\" Wilson (born January 29, 1953), also known as Uncle Charlie, is an American R&B singer, songwriter, producer and the former lead vocalist for The Gap Band. As a solo artist he has been nominated for eleven Grammy awards and six NAACP Image Awards (including one WIN), received a 2009 Soul Train Icon Award, and was a recipient of a BMI Icon Award in 2005. In 2009, he was named Billboard magazine's No. 1 Adult R&B Artist, and his song \"There Goes My Baby\" was named the No. 1 Urban Adult Song for 2009 in Billboard Magazine. On June 30, 2013, BET honored Wilson with a Lifetime Achievement Award that was presented to him by Justin Timberlake. The BET tribute performances included renditions of Wilson's songs performed by India Arie (\"There Goes My Baby\"), Jamie Foxx (\"Yearning for Your Love\"), and Stevie Wonder (\"Burn Rubber\") but it was not until Wilson himself took to the stage at the request of Timberlake to perform his Grammy-nominated song \"You Are\" and then transition into a medley of hit songs performing alongside Timberlake and surprise guests Snoop Dogg and Pharrell Williams that Wilson stole the show during the youth oriented program. The Charlie Wilson tribute helped BET achieve the highest ratings in years for the program and also earned the network the #1 primetime spot in the 18\u201349 demographic topping all its broadcast and cable competition for the night in both demographics and total viewers. Wilson is the national spokesman for the Prostate Cancer Foundation where there is a Creativity Award in his name which donates hundreds of thousands of dollars a year to researchers across the country for the development of creative science that conforms to PCF funding principles but is short-term and designed to allow development of otherwise unfunded ideas."@en ;

He has been rapping since he was 12. In 1991, as Kool Kim, he released the first of two albums with Hass G as the group the U.M.C.'s. But around the same time that Nas released Hip Hop Is Dead, NYOIL put a video up on MySpace and YouTube for his song \"Y'All Should All Get Lynched\", which was produced by DJ Slice of The Cr8Kickers. The track calls for the lynching of a number of major-label rappers, and the video features pictures of current rap stars such as 50 Cent and Three 6 Mafia coupled with images of lynchings, slavery, and minstrelsy. The video was banned from YouTube after less than 48 hours, and attracted a large amount of media attention for its controversial content. NYOIL did not give much biographical detail, refusing even to be photographed without his sunglasses on. NYOIL released his solo debut full-length album, HoodTREASON, on June 26, 2007. Singles from the album include \"Y'All Should All Get Lynched,\" \"Purrrfect Beat,\" and \"Hip Hop Ya Don't Stop\". HoodTREASON was reissued by Babygrande Records in 2008.

According to the documentary \"Benny Goodman: Adventures in the Kingdom of Swing\" and Ross Firestone's book \"Swing Swing Swing: The Life and Times of Benny Goodman,\" she and Benny had a brief romance and he proposed to her in Los Angeles in the summer of 1936. She accepted, but Goodman backed out a few months later, saying he wasn't ready for marriage and wanted to concentrate on his career. By December 1936, Ward had left the band. She married financier Albert Marx the following year and left the band. In 1938, Marx arranged for Goodman's Carnegie Hall concert to be recorded for her as an anniversary present. That recording was later released as a dual LP set by Columbia Records in 1950.During the 1940s, Ward worked with the bands of Hal McIntyre and Harry James.

Mendis was married to Ranjani for 33 years until her death in 2010, and has one son, Paulmarie, with whom Mendis ran Mediaeye Productions.

He mostly composes on acoustic guitar, although some of his recent work has had some electronica sound input. Many of his songs have become classics of the Qu\u00E9b\u00E9cois repertoire at cabaret nights, parties, camp fires, and especially at la F\u00EAte nationale du Qu\u00E9bec celebrations. Pich\u00E9 studied archaeology at the Universit\u00E9 de Montr\u00E9al, and in the early 1970s sang in Quebec colleges. In 1977 the keyboardist Robert L\u00E9ger of Beau Dommage encouraged him to record his first LP, \u00C0 qui appartient le beau temps, which sold more than 100,000 copies. From then on, Pich\u00E9 began working with the keyboardist Michel Hinton (also from Beau Dommage). His single \"Tous les vents\", reached second place on the Radio-activit\u00E9 chart in August 1984 and his album Nouvelles d'Europe won the F\u00E9lix Award for best rock album of 1985. In 1986 he performed with Michel Rivard and released a double album, Int\u00E9gral, which is a collection of all his works. He then travelled throughout Quebec and performed at the festivals of Mill\u00E9naire in Brussels, in La Rochelle, and in Nyon Switzerland. Sur le chemin des incendies, which sold more than 100,000 copies, revealed a more personal facet of the songwriter. Many pieces were written in collaboration with the guitarist Rick Haworth. \"J'appelle\", reached first place on the Radio activit\u00E9 chart in December 1988. Pich\u00E9 participated in the St-Jean Baptiste nationalist gatherings in 1990 on the Plains of Abraham of Quebec City, and on St. Helen's Island in Montreal. Often associated with the great names of the Quebec chanson, Pich\u00E9 participated in La F\u00EAte \u00E0 Vigneault at the Francofolies of Montreal in 1990, which celebrated the 30 year-career of the national poet. Montreal's La Presse proclaimed Pich\u00E9 'Personality of the Year' in the song category. An artist committed to the causes of workers, of the state, and of ecology, Pich\u00E9 is the songster of the common man. Such songs as \"\u00C0 qui appartient le beau temps\", and \"Les Pleins\" have become classics of the genre.

A self-taught musician, Zubir also worked as a score arranger and songwriter for Cathay-Keris Film Productions for 12 years, composing numerous songs for the company's Malay films. He is believed to have written about 1,500 songs, with less than 10% of them ever recorded. It has been said that Zubir was viewed by many as a composer with a \"true Malay soul\", as his songs were interwoven with historical messages and Malay truisms, and that he and his Minangkabau contemporaries awoke a wave of national consciousness in the 1950s."@en .

Trace (December 25, 1900 \u2013 August 31, 1993) was an American songwriter and orchestra leader of the 1930s, 1940s and 1950s whose peak of popularity was reached in the Chicago area during the height of the Big Band era. A native of Chicago, Al Trace played professional baseball before deciding on music as a career. His first jobs during the early 1920s included playing the drums and singing with various bands, until he formed his own band in 1933, the year his home city was celebrating its centennial with a World's Fair officially known as A Century of Progress International Exposition. The band's premiere engagement in May 1933 was at the Fair's French pavilion and, when the Fair closed for the winter on November, he remained in Chicago, beginning a long engagement at the Blackhawk Restaurant, followed by three years at the Sherman Hotel. Starting in early 1943 and continuing during and after World War II, the Al Trace Orchestra, including vocalists Toni Arden and Bob Vincent, were familiar regulars on Chicago-based It Pays to Be Ignorant, one of the most popular shows of the era referenced as the Golden Age of Radio. Trace recorded for several record companies: Mercury Records, MGM Records, Columbia Records, Damon Records, Regent Records and composed over 300 songs, some alone and others as a collaborator, most frequently with his ten-years-older brother, Ben, while also writing a considerable number of songs using the pseudonyms Clem Watts or Bob Hart. Among the Ben Trace/Al Trace collaborations was Al's most successful recording, \"You Call Everybody Darlin'\", which became a #1 hit in 1948. Another very popular song was \"If I Knew You Were Comin' I'd've Baked a Cake\". His other song collaborators included Al Hoffman, Bob Merrill, and Abner Silver. In 1975, shortly after his seventy-fourth birthday, he retired from active work as a songwriter and bandleader and joined with another ex-bandleader to form a booking agency in Scottsdale, Arizona. Al Trace died of a stroke in Sun City West, Arizona at the age of 92."@en ;

Her artist name, Kellyjackie, is an amalgam of the name of her childhood idol, Kelly Chen, and her own name \"Jackie\". Starting at the age of 13, while still in secondary school, Kellyjackie started putting her own covers of other Hong Kong pop singers' songs online. After about one year, she started writing her own songs. She then put her first self-composed song Lucky voice and her other songs onto the internet. In January 2005, when she was 16, she wrote the song He invites me to Disneyland (\u4ED6\u7D04\u6211\u53BB\u8FEA\u58EB\u5C3C) to cope with the stress of the Hong Kong Certificate of Education Examination. She claimed the song was inspired by the classic fairy tale of Sleeping Beauty and court romance. She eventually repeated form five, and entered PLK Vicwood KT Chong Sixth Form College with satisfactory results, but left the College in a year to develop her singing career. She uploaded her song He invites me to Disneyland to her band's forum, her Xanga site, i010.com and also cmidi.com for others to download for free. Surprisingly, the song quickly became \"viral\" over the internet (mainly through Bulletin Board Systems and WinMX) within a few weeks. For some time, the song ranked number 1 among Yahoo! Hong Kong's Top Searches (\u641C\u5C0B\u4EBA\u6C23\u699C). Many DJs also started talking about the song on the radio. Many were amazed by her talent, given her age and her busy schedule as a secondary school student preparing for her O-level exams. Nevertheless, the song eventually became extremely popular and received widely positive reviews in Hong Kong, Macau, and Guangdong and landed her a 5-year recording contract. To celebrate the opening of the Hong Kong Disneyland, the Walt Disney Company published the Hong Kong Disneyland -The Grand Opening Celebration Album (\u9999\u6E2F\u8FEA\u58EB\u5C3C\u6A02\u5712\u958B\u5E55\u7D00\u5FF5\u5927\u789F) and invited both Kellyjackie and Kelly Chen to perform the song He invites me to Disneyland, and later to record the song. After a 5-year hiatus from the Hong Kong music scene because of contract problems with her former manager, she made her comeback by signing with MusicNEXT in 2011 for 3 years."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Lecrae Devaughn Moore (born October 9, 1979), mononymously known as Lecrae, is an American Christian hip hop artist, songwriter, record producer and actor. He is the president, co-owner and co-founder of the independent record label Reach Records, and the co-founder and president of the non-profit organization ReachLife Ministries. To date, he has released seven studio albums and three mixtapes as a solo artist, and has released three studio albums, a remix album, and one EP as the leader of the hip hop group 116 Clique. He produced much of his earlier material along with other early Reach Records releases. Lecrae, in reference to his label as a Christian rapper, has stated that his music is just hip hop, though it reflects his Christian faith. In May 2016, Lecrae signed to Columbia Records in a joint deal between his label and Columbia. Lecrae debuted with Real Talk in 2004 through Reach Records. His third solo album, Rebel, released in 2008, became the first Christian hip hop album to reach No. 1 on the Billboard Gospel chart. Rehab followed in 2010, and Lecrae began attracting mainstream attention when he performed at the 2011 BET Hip Hop Awards Cypher and appeared on the Statik Selektah song \"Live & Let Live\" from Population Control. On May 10, 2012, Lecrae released his first mixtape, Church Clothes, which was hosted by DJ Don Cannon. Considered his breakthrough into mainstream hip hop, the mixtape was downloaded over 100,000 times in less than 48 hours. His sixth studio album, Gravity, came out on September 4, 2012, and has been called the most important album in Christian hip hop history by Rapzilla and Atlanta Daily World. The album debuted as the best-selling album overall in the iTunes Store, No. 3 on the Billboard 200 and won the Grammy Award for Best Gospel Album at the 2013 Grammy Awards, marking the first time that a hip hop artist received this award. Lecrae released his seventh album, Anomaly, on September 9, 2014. It debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 with 88,587 copies sold through the first week, the first album to top both the Billboard 200 and the Gospel chart simultaneously. Lecrae received nominations for Artist of the Year at the 43rd, 44th, 45th, and 46th GMA Dove Awards, the last of which he won, and for Best Gospel Artist at the 2013 and 2015 BET Awards, the latter of which he won, a first for a rap artist. Lecrae's filmography includes a role in the television film A Cross to Bear (2012) and a brief role as Dr. Malmquist in the comedy film Believe Me (2014). In the social sphere, Lecrae has advocated for the preservation of responsibility and fatherhood as a value among men in the United States, and in 2013 partnered with Dwyane Wade and Joshua DuBois in the multimedia initiative This Is Fatherhood as part of the Obama administration's Fatherhood and Mentoring Initiative. He has also contributed articles to Billboard discussing racial tension and injustice in the United States, where he has called for willingness to listen to the oppressed as well as pointing out a need for spiritual healing."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Martin \"Marty\" O'Donnell (born May 1, 1955) is an American composer known for his work on video game developer Bungie's series, such as Myth, Oni, Halo, and Destiny. O'Donnell collaborated with his musical colleague Michael Salvatori for many of the scores; he has also directed voice talent and sound design for the Halo trilogy. O'Donnell was Bungie's audio lead until April 11, 2014. O'Donnell began his music career writing television and radio jingles such as the FintStones vitamins song and scoring for radio stations and films. O'Donnell moved to composing video game music when his company, TotalAudio, did the sound design for the 1997 title Riven. After producing the music for Myth II, Bungie contracted O'Donnell to work on their other projects, including Oni and the project that would become Halo: Combat Evolved. O'Donnell ended up joining the Bungie staff only ten days before the studio was bought by Microsoft, and would be the audio director for all Bungie projects until he was fired. O'Donnell's score to the Halo trilogy has been called iconic, earning him several awards, and the commercial soundtrack release of the music to Halo 2 was the best-selling video game soundtrack of all time in the United States. He then went on to compose the scores to Halo 3 and Halo: Reach, released on September 25, 2007, and September 14, 2010, respectively. His final work for Bungie was composing music for the 2014 video game Destiny."@en ;

After the pair split in 1995 Pete Rock, whose work with CL had garnered him a reputation as one of the most acclaimed producers in hip-hop, went on to produce (and remix) tracks for dozens of marquee-name and/or well-respected acts, and to release a batch of solo and instrumental albums. CL Smooth remained musically inactive. The pair managed to reconcile their differences only long enough to record five isolated tracks in the ten years since their split: \"Da Two,\" \"Back On Da Block,\" \"Fly 'Til I Die,\" \"Appreciate,\" and \"It's A Love Thing.\" There were talks of a definitive reunion and a new album in 2004; however, the speculation was dismissed by both parties after another fallout. During his period of hiatus, Smooth declined even to appear as a guest on other artists' albums, with the exception of \"Only the Strong Survive\" with DJ Krush in 1996. Recently, however, he has contributed featured guest vocals to songs by AZ (\"Magic Hour\"), Nujabes (\"Sky is Falling\") and Dipset affiliate J. R. Writer (the remix of \"Mesmerize\") or Supafuh (\"Act of Faith\"). He released his debut solo album, American Me, in 2006. To promote the album, Shaman Work released a promotional mixtape compiled by DJ J Period called Man On Fire in late April 2006, featuring 36 minutes of freestyles and a remixed version of the track \"Impossible\". He was also featured on the DJ Jazzy Jeff album The Return of the Magnificent on the track \"All I Know,\" which was also featured in the video game NBA Live 08. In October 2010 Smooth and Pete Rock headlined the \"Clean Energy Tour,\" which had six shows all over California and focused on voter mobilization leading up to the November mid-term elections. He has developed an interest in climate change and become a vocal opponent of Proposition 23."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Dadawa is the stage name of Zhu Zheqin (\u6731\u54F2\u7434), a Chinese singer/songwriter and contemporary Chinese music\u2019s first independent producer. Of Hunanese origin, ethnically Han and Miao, she was born in Guangzhou, China. Dadawa has been referred to as the \"Chinese Enya\". She has also been described as China's Ry Cooder, for her eclectic forays into world music including one recording and tour with Ireland's Chieftains. Dadawa has collaborated with composer/producer He Xuntian for several of her albums. A Shanghai music professor. In 1994 He Xuntian and Dadawa travelled to Tibet to research Tibetan culture and music. The result, Sister Drum (1995), her second album, was an international success, selling millions of copies worldwide. Following that, Dadawa's album Voices From The Sky was released in 1997. Dadawa was the first contemporary Chinese musician to have her music released globally, for which she has received an MTV award for her contribution to Asian music. Dadawa has developed a reputation as a world traveler and adventurer, visiting many countries and immersing herself in a variety of cultures around the world. She has also worked in television journalism, in particular hosting a major Chinese television documentary, \"Into Africa\", which introduced that continent to hundreds of millions of viewers. In August 2006, Dadawa released the album \"Seven Days\", her final CD collaboration with composer He Xuntian. This album did not contain any overt Tibetan elements, but still maintained lyrical references to Buddhist ideas. Musically, the concept leaned more toward Chinese traditional folk songs with pan-Asian elements. However, her trademark melody lines, East Asian percussion, and ambient electronic and classical instrumentation persisted. Meanwhile, she created a band made up of Canadian musicians including Ron Ron Korb, George George Gao, Bill Bridges, Paul Hoffert, Lew Mele, and Ben Riley and toured in China to introduce her new music to the Chinese public. Dadawa's work on \"Seven Days\" was nominated for a BBC World Music Award in 2007. In the same year, Dadawa won the prestigious Tom.com award for the \"Most Influential Woman in Chinese Music\" and \"Seven Days\" was voted a Top Ten album in China by both Sina.Sina.com and the Beijing Evening News. \"Seven Days\" also went on to win an award for best world fusion album at the 7th Annual Independent Music Awards. In 2007, Dadawa completed a documentary film of her musical sojourn to India, Nepal and Tibet, co-directed with Oscar winner, Ross Kauffman. In January 2009, Dadawa was appointed a United Nations Development Program Goodwill Ambassador in China, with a focus on preserving ethnic music and artisanal handicrafts. In the years that followed, Dadawa continued to record, and tour, taking multicultural Chinese music to the world. In 2009, in her capacity as UNDP Goodwill Ambassador, Dadawa embarked on an ethnic music exploration tour, travelling over 20,000 kilometers to collect over 1,000 songs, and 20,000 images in Yunnan, Guizhou, Inner Mongolia, Xinjiang and Tibet. To reach a broader audience she produced a 17-episode documentary of her musical journey for the Travel Channel. Since 2009, in China\u2019s major opera houses, in Hong Kong, as well as in Europe, in collaboration with young Mongolian composer Zulan, Dadawa has performed a new synthesis of multicultural Chinese music which includes on stage many of the ethnic music masters Dadawa met on her travels. This new wave of Chinese music was written, arranged and mixed by Dadawa and Zulan and performed on stage in collaboration with many of China\u2019s avant garde musicians and artists. The 2013 \u201CShow the World\u201D campaign and tour, presenting works inspired by and collected during her exploration resulted in her latest album \u201CMoonrise\u201D. In November 2013, the title track was released on the Chinese Internet and trended immediately to the top single. Produced over a period of 4\u00BD years, with hundreds of hours in the field and in the studio, the much awaited CD was released to critical acclaim on December 7, 2013."@en ;

Very little is known for certain about his life, other than he tutored Charlie Patton in the ways of the blues. There have been suggestions that he moved to Chicago shortly after World War I. He left no recordings. According to researcher David Evans, Sloan was born in Mississippi in 1870, and by 1900 was living in the same community as the Patton and Chatmon families near Bolton, Mississippi. He moved to the Dockery Plantation near Indianola about the same time as the Pattons, between 1901 and 1904. Patton received some direct instruction from Sloan, and played with him for several years. Two of Patton\u2019s later accompanists, Tommy Johnson and Son House, both stated that Patton \"dogged every step\" of Sloan's. Further research based on Census records has suggested that, in 1920, Sloan and his family were living around West Memphis, Arkansas. He may have been the Henry Sloan whose death, aged 78, occurred in Crittenden County on March 13, 1948."@en ;

He became a prominent race records artist, with a prolific output of recordings in genres including Piedmont blues, country blues, gospel music, and social protest songs. In 1931, White moved to New York, and within a decade his fame had spread widely. His repertoire expanded to include urban blues, jazz, traditional folk songs, and political protest songs, and he was in demand as an actor on radio, Broadway, and film. White became the closest black friend and confidant of President Franklin D. Roosevelt. However, White's anti-segregationist and international human rights political stance presented in many of his recordings and in his speeches at rallies were subsequently used by McCarthyites as a pretext for labeling him a communist to slander and harass him. From 1947 through the mid-1960s, White was caught up in the anti-communist Red Scare, and as a consequence his career was damaged.

Mustis joined Dimmu Borgir in 1998 and has contributed to the further progression of their ambient, atmospherical, symphonic sound. This can be heard in songs such as \"Progenies of the Great Apocalypse,\" which he composed, on their 2003 album, Death Cult Armageddon. His other studio work with Dimmu Borgir includes Spiritual Black Dimensions (1999), Puritanical Euphoric Misanthropia (2001), and the re-release of Stormbl\u00E5st (2005) and In Sorte Diaboli (2007). Mustis departed the band in 2009 and issued a statement in which he implied that he was being kept out of the proper registration for music he was writing. Due to this, according to his statement, he was fired by text message and he will be allowing \"the resolution come from the lawyers instead of dealing with more dishonesty and lies on a one-on-one personal level.\" Mustis' surname Mustaparta comes from Finnish language. Literally translated, it means \"black beard.\" On 29 November 2010 Mustis posted the following statement on his Facebook fan page. \"As you all can see I have no control over this site yet, but will try to get it soon as possible. If not..keep your eyes open for a new one. And thanks everyone for all the nice words in here.As you can see I decided to join my friends of Susperia where my first performance will be early next year. More info to come.

	dbo:abstract	"Cheatham was born in Detroit, Michigan. Encouraged by his mother to sing, over the years he joined several local groups including The Young Sirs, Mad Dog And The Pups and Gaslight before releasing a single, \"Hard Times\" on the Tier record label. He then joined another group, the Sins of Satan, the group later being renamed as Roundtrip. They finally took Cheatham's first name and recorded two albums as Oliver. Cheatham then signed for MCA Records as a solo singer. He worked with Al Hudson of the band One Way on his first album, The Boss. His first chart success came in 1983 with \"Get Down Saturday Night\", co-written by Cheatham and One Way's Kevin McCord, which reached no.37 on the Billboard R&B chart, and also reached no.38 on the UK singles chart. The album, Saturday Night, produced by Al Perkins, was released the same year. In 1986, he moved to the Critique label, and had further success in the US with the singles \"S.O.S.\" (R&B chart no.35), and \"Celebrate (Our Love)\". Other Cheatham singles included \"Mama Said,\" \"Put a Little Love in Your Heart,\" \"Things to Make U Happy,\" and \"Wish on a Star.\" After moving to the New York-based Warlock label, he recorded \"Turn Out the Lights\" and \"Mindbuster\" with Jocelyn Brown. He spent much of the 1990s working as a backing singer with artists including Leo Sayer, and released his final album, Stand for Love, in 2002. He returned to the charts in 2003, when he was featured in Room 5's UK #1 single, \"Make Luv\", which sampled \"Get Down Saturday Night\", though Cheatham re-recorded his vocal parts for later releases. The track was featured on a commercial for Lynx deodorant on British TV. Its success in the UK led Cheatham to relocate to Surrey, England, and he recorded in London for the Native Soul record label. Elements of \"Get Down Saturday Night\" were also used in Michael Gray's 2004 hit, \"The Weekend\". It also featured in Grand Theft Auto: Vice City and Ex Machina.The track was also sampled for Lino di Meglio's 2013 song \"I Can't Live Without (Dino In Paris Full Vox)\". Cheatham died on November 29, 2013, at the age of 65, following a heart attack in his sleep."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Peter Overend Watts (born 13 May 1947 in Yardley, Birmingham) is an English bass guitar player and founding member of 1970s rock band, Mott the Hoople. Following the departure of Ian Hunter and Mick Ronson from the band, in 1974, the remaining members of Mott the Hoople recruited relative unknowns Ray Major, on guitar, and Nigel Benjamin, on vocals. The name was abbreviated to Mott and a further two albums were recorded with this line-up, before Benjamin quit. Watts continued with Dale \"Buffin\" Griffin, Morgan Fisher and Ray Major in the Mott successor British Lions, recruiting former Medicine Head member John Fiddler, until their demise around 1979. He later became a record producer, producing albums for artists such as Hanoi Rocks, Dumb Blondes, . Watts's bass of choice was a white Gibson Thunderbird, one of which was later sold to Wishbone Ash bassist Martin Turner. In 1978 he sold a customised cream Gibson Thunderbird bass guitar to Shanne Bradley, bassist with The Nipple Erectors, The Nips and The Men They Couldn't Hang. It can be heard on many of her recordings. In January 2009 it was confirmed that Watts and the other original members of Mott the Hoople would reform for three 40th anniversary reunion concerts in October 2009. The reunion at the HMV Hammersmith Apollo, London, England was extended to 5 shows due to popular demand. In August 2009 American rock music group Mambo Sons released their double album \"Heavy Days\" featuring a song in tribute to him entitled \"Overend Watts\". The video for this tune has become a fan favorite, viewable on YouTube at \"Mambo Sons - Overend Watts\". In November 2013 Mott The Hoople again reunited, with Martin Chambers once again sitting in (for an ailing Buffin) on drums, for a series of UK gigs in Birmingham, Glasgow, Newcastle and Manchester, before concluding at the o2 in London."@en ;

His song \"In the Blue of Evening\", co-written with Tom Adair, was a number one hit for the Tommy Dorsey Orchestra in 1943. D'Artega was born in Silao, Guanajuato, Mexico. His family emigrated to the U.S. in 1918. D'Artega studied music and composition at Strassberger's Conservatory in St. Louis, Missouri with Boris Levenson, who was a pupil of Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov. He became a well-known conductor on stage and on air, and in 1946 initiated the Carnegie Hall \"Pops\" concerts with members of the New York Philharmonic. In 1947 he played the role of Tchaikovsky in the film Carnegie Hall, conducting the film score as well. He was guest conductor with, among others, the Buffalo Symphony Orchestra, the Miami Symphony Orchestra, the Saint Louis Symphony Orchestra and the NBC Symphony of the Air. D'Artega wrote over 50 songs. Perhaps his most widely recognized composition in the U.S. is \"The NBC Chimes Theme\". One of D'Artega's earlier ventures was D'Artega's All-Girl Orchestra, a twenty piece show band. The group was formed in New York City in 1942 and appeared in the Broadway play called \"Hair Pin Harmony\". As a result of that success, the group was booked by the newly formed United Service Organization (USO) Camp Shows. The group traveled coast to coast playing at various military bases, ending in California where they were featured in the Paramount Pictures release \"You Can\u2019t Ration Love\". The All-Girl Orchestra continued with the USO and traveled throughout the European and Pacific theaters during World War II. The first tour started in Italy and followed the advance of Allied troops into Germany, France, and Czechoslovakia. The orchestra continued service with the USO traveling to China, Japan, and islands in the Pacific. D'Artega was not only the inspiration, but wrote, arranged, and conducted the group."@en .

Mauboy's second studio album, Get 'Em Girls (2010), showcased a more hard-edged R&B sound than her previous release, and produced four platinum singles. Her third studio album, Beautiful (2013), which explored a mixture of dance-oriented tracks with R&B and pop, included the top-ten hits \"Pop a Bottle (Fill Me Up)\", \"Never Be the Same\" and \"Can I Get a Moment?\". Aside from her music career, Mauboy has also ventured into acting, with starring roles in films Bran Nue Dae (2010) and The Sapphires (2012), which earned her the AACTA Award for Best Actress in a Supporting Role. She returned to acting in 2016, playing the lead role in the television drama series The Secret Daughter. It is Mauboy's first major TV role and was written especially for her. Mauboy is one of Australia's most successful female artists. She has achieved three top-ten albums and 15 top-twenty singles, including nine top-ten hits.

He composes all the music for both his solo projects. He plays guitars on his solo trilogy and keyboards with Luca Turilli's Dreamquest featuring Dominique Leurquin as the guitarist. On August 2011, Turilli and Staropoli proceeded to a friendly split.

He had been active since the 1970s and his popularity peaked with the hit single \"Kamar Bareek-e-Man,\" the renditions of which are sampled by Iranian and Tajik singers of Tajikistan up until today, or his song \" Pari Cheri\" sung by many new up and coming talents of Afghanistan like Obaid Juenda and Timor Jalali. In his later years, he lived a secluded life in Germany and seldom performed. Zahir Howaida was from the Chendawol district of Kabul. His son Arash Howaida has followed his father's steps choosing music as a career. Mohammad Zahir Howida was born in 1946 in Daikundi. After the birth of Zahir, his father moved his family to Kabul and thereafter transferred to the city of Mazar-e-Sharif in the Balkh province of northern Afghanistan. While in Mazar-e-Sharif, Zahir Howida entered the first grade at the Sultan Ghiassuddin Elementary school in 1953.The same year Zahir's father died at the age of 33 leaving behind Zahir, his brother and widowed mother. The family moved to Kabul where Zahir attended 2nd grade at the renowned Sayed Jamaluddin Afghan elementary school famous for its arts and humanities courses. At the age of 13, Zahir's family moved to Booksellers Avenue of Kabul and subsequently entered Isteqlal High School, earning the highest ranking in his class. Zahir didn't find school curriculum very interesting and often cut class to walk across the school to the public library and borrow books of his interest and read. Zahir spent years at home with a huge kettle of tea, scissor print cigarettes and books about social and political issues. His favorite author was Maxim Gorky and favorite subject was socialism and social democratic ideas. Upon graduating high school, Zahir attended Institute of Theatre and Arts of Kabul and joined the Kabul Armature Orchestra led by Fazel Ahmad Zekria Naynawaz along with his brother Kabir Howida, Rahim Mehryar, Rahim Jahani and more. Zahir was a mandolin player and a backup singer for Akbar Ramish at the Isteqlal High school shows celebrating Afghanistan Day. Naynawaz encouraged Zahir to sing solo, but he didn't find it suitable during the live show to sing at such a short notice. Hamid Estemadi who had a great voice but did not sing publicly since he was a member of the royal family encouraged Zahir to take his place at the Afghanistan Day show. Zahir was dragged on stage by Hamid and he sang his first song, but was faced with displeasure of the crowd. Moments later Zahir appeared in costume during a play and sang another song which delighted the audience and received an endurance of applause. At this orchestra Zahir showed immense talent as a vocalist and earned a scholarship to learn operatic and eastern classical music at Tchaikovsky Institute in Moscow. Upon his return to Kabul, Zahir began his musical career which brought him overnight success. He composed all his songs with exception of 4 songs which he often credited to their original composers Ahmad Zahir and Mas'hoor Jamal. The songs Rasha dar dast baghban and Gar zolf preishanat are of Ahmad Zahir and Laila mah man shoda shaida and Ay mo telaie are composition of Mas'hoor Jamal. Zahir Howida toured Tajikistan, Iran, USSR, Europe and Americas. His song \"Kamar Bareek\" became an instant hit in Iran where for years after many Iranian singers covered the song in concerts and Iranian National TV. Majority of Zahir Howida's songs are political in nature and anti-establishment. He often spoke out against the monarchy and the first president of Afghanistan Daud Khan. While all artist who wish to appear on National TV were authorized to sing in both Pashtu and Dari, Zahir refused to sing in Pashto claiming that whenever Ustad Awalmeer sings in Dari he will follow up with a song in Pashto. Zahir after the fall of the republic of Afghanistan into the hands of the Marxist communist regime found many opportunities in National Television and National Radio. He recorded most of his songs during this tenure, hosting a variety show on Television and radio. After the fall of the communist government, Zahir and his family moved to Germany. He toured the world with stops on North America, Europe and Australia for his farewell concert where he broke his vow and sang in Pashto. He followed the concert with the release of his final Album \"Ay Kash\". Zahir Howida's brother is Kabir Howaida, a renowned piano player. His sons Arash Howaida and Qais Howaida are also following the footsteps of their father into the music scene with their own style of music fusion."@en .

Her style was partially inspired by American singers of the 1950s. Simultaneously, it was in the spirit of the modal jazz scene going down in Europe in the 1960s. Mostly, Carola's jazz repertoire consisted in idiosyncratic versions of American songs in English, while her most famous jazz track \"The Flame\" was an original composition by Esa Pethman and the lyrics by the singer herself. As the vocalist for Esa Pethman's quartet and Hazy Osterwald's sextet in the early 1960s, Carola made fame in Finland and Sweden, and toured Poland, Czechoslovakia, and Switzerland. Her most significant recording is a session with the Heikki Sarmanto Trio from 1966, which the Finnish Music Information Centre considers among the original blueprints of Finnish jazz. Carola's recordings have been credited for the accosting tone of her contralto voice and her phrasing. The singer also co-produced the groovy approach of her supporting orchestras. In late 1960s and early 1970s, she performed in nine languages and a wide variety of styles, including chanson, schlager, Latin, rock'n'roll, and soul. After her death of Alzheimer's disease in 1997, Carola's music was revived in 2004 with two Best of albums and Carola & Heikki Sarmanto Trio reaching the Finnish charts."@en ;

She has also had the opportunity to showcase her multiple talents with singing, dancing, and acting before live audiences as part of the musical \"Broadway: A Kid's Review\", presented by the famous TropiGala in Miami and the Apollo Showtime Kids. Having been named a finalist on \"Showtime in Harlem\" Kids Finals, Jaqueline won an all-expenses paid trip to New York City in January 2003 to perform live. Later on that same year, in July 2003, she was also invited to perform on a \u201CYoung Stars of Miami Tour\u201D in Buenos Aires, Argentina, sponsored and coordinated by Argentina\u2019s Teatro Premier. In March 2004, Coca-Cola sponsored Jaqueline to perform at the largest Latin American music festival in the world: Miami, Florida's Calle Ocho Festival. Her highest recognition happened recently when she was invited to the Estefan Studios by Emilio Estefan himself, to help record \u201CEl Ultimo Adios\u201D, a song written in memory of those lost in the September 11th terrorist attacks. She also was fortunate enough to appear in Sabado Gigante's \"Estrellas del Futuro\"."@en .

He comes from a family of musicians in Jaipur. His father, the late Shashi Mohan Bhatt, a sitarist of great repute and a professor at the University of Rajasthan, Jaipur trained many musicians in the family including Krishna Bhatt, Manju Mehta in Ahmedabad and Vishwa Mohan Bhatt. Krishna Bhatt\u2019s forefathers migrated from the south of India (Andhra Pradesh) to the state of Rajasthan in the northwest, a princely state then, to seek employment in the \u201CGunijankh\u0101n\u0101\u201D (department of learned scholars) of the Maharaja of Jaipur. They were Sanskrit scholars, poets, and musicians. In his teens, Krishna\u2019s musical grooming was further enhanced by many years of study under the tutelage of his Guru Pt. Ravi Shankar, and musicians Pt. Nikhil Banerjee and Ustad Ali Akbar Khan, who had a strong impact on Krishna's musical growth. While developing his own individual style, Krishna\u2019s music was greatly influenced by twentieth century stalwarts such as the vocalists Amir Khan, Bade Gulam Ali Khan, Abdul Karim Khan, Begum Akhtar, Shobha Gurtu as well as folk singers of Rajasthan. Krishna\u2019s repertoire in performance includes a wide variety of rare and old traditional compositions from these masters of music. Krishna Bhatt has received numerous awards and honors including the Sangeet Kalaratna (Jewel of Music) in 2009.

	dbo:abstract	"Macedonio Alcal\u00E1 Prieto (September 12, 1831 in Oaxaca, Oaxaca \u2013 August 24, 1869 in Oaxaca, Oaxaca) was a Mexican violinist, pianist and songwriter remembered today especially for his waltz, \"Dios nunca muere\" (God Never Dies). Alcal\u00E1 was born in the City of Oaxaca in 1831. He showed an early interest in music, and began attending a school established by Professor Jos\u00E9 Domingo Martinez. His musical talent was soon evident, and he learned to play the piano, cello, viola, flute and ophicleide. He was an accomplished musician with all these instruments, but his main instrument was the violin. As a violinist, he was in demand not only in the churches, but also at popular dances and social gatherings. His persistence and dedication were rewarded by a scholarship from the State of Oaxaca, allowing him to continue his studies in Mexico City. At the conclusion of his studies he returned to Oaxaca, where he became a member of the Philharmonic Society of Santa Cecilia, an orchestra specializing in the performance of works of regional composers. A short time later he became the director of the Banda de M\u00FAsica de Oaxaca. A few years later he moved to Yanhuitl\u00E1n. On July 30, 1854, Alcal\u00E1, 23, married Petronila Palacios, 21, of Yanhuitl\u00E1n. They had three children, two boys and a girl. Although he was recognized as an accomplished musician, he was unable to earn enough money in the profession to support his family. This led to depression and alcoholism. He intended to return to Oaxaca, but fell ill. His brothers refused to help, but the Philharmonic Society of Santa Cecilia came to his aid, supplying a doctor, medicines, and other forms of support. During his convalescence, a delegation of Indigenous from a nearby town, Tlacolula, arrived with the request that he compose a waltz in honor of the Virgin Mary, patron of their town. Although still far from well, Alcal\u00E1 worked hard on the waltz, \"Dios nunca muere\". It was a huge success from the first time it was played in public, and the town was very grateful. About 1867 he became professor of music at the Hacienda de la Concepci\u00F3n. He died in 1869 in Oaxaca. After his death his brother Bernab\u00E9 published \"Dios nunca muere\" under his own name, but natives of Tlacolula protested, and demonstrated that the work was really by Macedonio. The waltz is now the unofficial state anthem of Oaxaca. Oaxaque\u00F1os stand when they hear it. Alcal\u00E1 was said to be passionate and high-strung, characteristics that distinguished his playing and his compositions. But he passed his life struggling with poverty, disease and alcoholism. Few of his compositions survive, because he was remiss in transcribing his improvisations. Among the surviving works are \"Marcha Funebre\" (Funeral March), \"Solo dios en los cielos\" (Only God in Heaven), \"El Cohete\" (The Rocket), \"Ave Maria\" and of course the well-known waltz \"Dios nunca muere\". He died in Oaxaca in 1869, at the age of 37. A theater and a street are named for him in that city."@en ;

Slaughter is known for her unique, driving style of clawhammer banjo playing, with complex noting and double-noting and featuring both uppicking and downpicking. She also occasionally played fiddle.

	dbo:abstract	"Ronald William Wycherley (17 April 1940 \u2013 28 January 1983), better known by his stage name Billy Fury, was an English singer from the late 1950s to the mid 1960s, and remained an active songwriter until the 1980s. Rheumatic fever, which he first contracted as a child, damaged his heart and ultimately contributed to his death. An early British rock and roll (and film) star, he equalled the Beatles' record of 24 hits in the 1960s, and spent 332 weeks on the UK chart, without a chart-topping single or album. Allmusic journalist Bruce Eder stated, \"His mix of rough-hewn good looks and unassuming masculinity, coupled with an underlying vulnerability, all presented with a good voice and some serious musical talent, helped turn Fury into a major rock and roll star in short order\". Others have suggested that Fury's rapid rise to prominence was due to his \"Elvis Presley-influenced, hip-swivelling and at times highly suggestive stage act.\""@en ;

He is best known for his twelve-year tenure as the bass guitarist of the hard rock band Guns N' Roses, with whom he achieved worldwide success in the late 1980s and early 1990s. McKagan rejoined the band in 2016, following their induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Towards the end of his first tenure with Guns N' Roses, McKagan released a solo album, Believe in Me (1993), and formed the short-lived supergroup Neurotic Outsiders. Following his departure from Guns N' Roses in 1997, McKagan briefly reunited with his pre-success Seattle punk band 10 Minute Warning, before forming the still-active hard rock band Loaded, in which he performs lead vocals and rhythm guitar. Between 2002 and 2008, he played bass in the supergroup Velvet Revolver with his former Guns N' Roses band mates Slash and Matt Sorum. He briefly performed with Jane's Addiction in 2010 and joined the supergroup Hollywood Vampires in 2016. In addition to his musical career, McKagan has established himself as a writer. He has written weekly columns on a wide variety of topics for SeattleWeekly.com, Playboy.com, and ESPN.com.
