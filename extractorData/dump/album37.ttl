<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pop_Psychology_(album)>	dbo:abstract	"Pop Psychology is the third studio album by Neon Trees. The lead single, \"Sleeping with a Friend\", was released on January 11, 2014, and the album was released on April 22, 2014. The record is based on and is the cathartic product of lead singer, Tyler Glenn\u2019s therapy sessions. Glenn started seeing a therapist after canceling some tour dates in 2012 while the band promoted their second record, Picture Show, due to trying to find himself mentally and figure out who he was. \u201CAt moments there\u2019s a cry for help and sadness...But I think it\u2019s a real fun pop record at the heart of it and something with a message too,\" he said of his band\u2019s third album. Also addressed in the album's lyricism from Glenn's therapy sessions are his sexuality and sex, in general."@en .

	dbo:abstract	"Up! Close and Personal is the fourth live video album by Canadian singer Shania Twain. It was directed by Beth McCarthy-Miller, and produced by team composed of Dan Braun, Cliff Burnstein, Carol Donovan, McCarthy-Miller, Peter Mensch, and Marc Reiter. The concert was filmed in November 2003 at a sound stage in Nashville, Tennessee, with an audience of 300 people. When conceptualizing the show, Twain desired to make the setting intimate and perform the songs acoustically, so she turned to bluegrass band Alison Krauss and Union Station to perform backup during the concert. It was also modeled after Elvis Presley's '68 Comeback Special, with a similar stage and Twain being costumed by black, leather jumpsuit. Up! Close and Personal premiered on the National Broadcasting Company (NBC) on November 25, 2003, and was high in ratings, being watched by over 9 million viewers in the United States. Nearly a year later, Up! Close and Personal was released by Mercury Nashville Records, in DVD format, as a video album on November 8, 2004 to coincide with the release Twain's Greatest Hits album. The video also served as a source to audio tracks used as B-sides for the singles from Greatest Hits. Up! Close and Personal received mixed reviews from music critics (some who believed she was overshadowed by Krauss' talents, others who complimented her vocal talents) and positive commercial outcomes. It peaked at number eight on Billboard's Top Music Video sales chart, and was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for shipment of 100,000 copies in the United States."@en ;

Compiled by Phil Knox-Roberts of WEA UK, it was highlights of Isaak's recording career to that point. Three of the songs were taken from his first album Silvertone (1985): \"Dancin, \"Voodoo\" and \"Funeral in the Rain\", four from his 1987 album, Chris Isaak: \"Blue Hotel\", \"Lie to Me\", \"Heart Full of Soul\" (a cover of The Yardbirds 1965 top 10 hit) and \"You Owe Me Some Kind of Love\" and four from 1989's Heart Shaped World: - \"Wicked Game\", \"Nothing's Changed\", \"Blue Spanish Sky\" and \"Heart Shaped World\". An instrumental version of the song \"Wicked Game\" was included as a bonus track. The album was released on CD and LP. \"Blue Hotel\" was re-released as a single in support of the album, reaching #17 in the UK and #23 in Australia.

	dbo:abstract	"You're Never Alone with a Schizophrenic is the fourth solo album by Ian Hunter. The album features members of Bruce Springsteen's E Street Band as the backing band. It is considered by many to be Hunter's best recording. The title was dreamed up by co-producer Mick Ronson which he had planned for one of his solo albums. Hunter loved the title so much that he offered Ronson co-writing credit on the first single \"Just Another Night\" in exchange for the use of the title for the album. \"Just Another Night\" reached the Billboard Hot 100 No. 68. The album became one of Hunter's biggest sellers at the time. Later, singer Barry Manilow covered the song \"Ships\" for his album One Voice which became a top-ten hit. In 2009 EMI released a 30th-anniversary reissue of the album remastered with five bonus tracks on the first disc of outtakes and a second disc of live tracks recorded on the tour to support the album but previously unreleased. The reissue also came with a deluxe booklet discussing the making the album along with vintage and new interviews with Hunter. The song \"Cleveland Rocks\" (originally recorded as a single for Columbia Records and entitled \"England Rocks\" around the time of \"Overnight Angels\") later became a hit when The Presidents of the United States of America re-recorded the song as the theme song to The Drew Carey Show, raising Hunter's profile and prompting the release of the album on CD."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Fight or Flight is the debut studio album by American pop singer-songwriter Emily Osment. The album was released in Canada on September 28, 2010, and in the US October 5, 2010 by Wind-Up Records. She has worked with producers from her previous musical efforts such as Matthew Bair, as well as Toby Gad, Nellee Hooper and Mandi Perkins. Fight or Flight mainly draws from the genre of dance-pop while incorporating electropop, and containing dancehall and techno, among other influences. Lyrical themes include topics of love, freedom, and the joy of living in the moment. Osment wrote all of the songs on the album, with a degree of guidance from several songwriters, including Ron Aniello. The album has received generally positive reviews from critics, with most stating it is an improvement from her debut EP All the Right Wrongs. The album peaked at number seventy-two in Spain and debuted in the US at number 170 on the Billboard 200 chart. The single \"Let's Be Friends\", debuted and peaked at number twenty-four on the Billboard Japan Hot 100 chart, making the song Osment's first top-thirty hit as a single and her most successful single to date. In addition, the single was also successful in Germany, peaking at number sixty-seven and remained in the German chart for over six weeks. The follow up single, \"Lovesick\", was also a commercial success, peaking at number sixty-six in Canada, making it her highest charting single there. It also became her first to chart in the UK, where it peaked at number fifty-seven. Osment promoted the album mainly through musical performances and touring. She has performed the album's lead single, \"Let's Be Friends\" on The Dome 55 in Germany, as well as on the Canadian television show Toronto Breakfast Television, in which the song was performed acoustically. The single was also premiered and performed live during her Clap Your Hands Tour during 2010. On December 23, 2010, Osment performed the album's second official single, \"Lovesick\" on The View. During 2011, she performed on several television networks in Germany in support of the album. The performances included Osment performing \"Lovesick\", and one performance saw Osment performing her previous single, \"All the Way Up\"."@en ;

I believe we are making a record that will retain what is the main essence of Silent Civilian, but maturing greatly pushing forward.\" Speaking about the darker themed lyrics, Santos explained \"I went from being in a pretty solid relationship, having a house and a wife to sleeping on the recording studio floor and losing it all. I was in a really dark place when writing the lyrics to this record. I had a lot of animosity to certain people in my life at the time and it just reflected through my writing.\" The album debuted at #21 on the Top New Artist Albums (Heatseekers) chart, moving roughly 1,600 copies during its first week of release. The first single to be released off the album was \"Last One Standing\". The video depicts the band playing amid scenes of soldiers fighting and being attacked in a Middle Eastern environment, along with flashes of a suburban home-life.

The album's biggest hit was the bluesy \"Shop Around\", which was released as a single in 1960 and peaked at #1 on the Billboard R&B singles chart and #2 on the pop singles chart (#1 Pop, Cashbox). \"Shop Around\" was the first R&B #1 single for both the Miracles and Motown label.

This came as a surprise to fans, considering Kiske's desire to leave the world of Helloween and heavy metal behind him. The album received a rather mixed critical support. Most reviewers were excited about the new acoustic arrangements and especially about Kiske's still powerful voice and wide vocal range. Other reviews criticized the album for the fact that it lacked any major innovative arrangements. According to Michael Kiske, Past In Different Ways \"on one hand shows that I don't reject my past just because I'm a different person today, and on the other hand it can maybe give people who were part of that past a different view at those songs. It's my music, I can still identify myself with its spirit...I generally brought each song down to its basics, threw out useless weight and sometimes changed the key to make them sound better as acoustics; and I was surprised how well they worked like that\".

dbr:Tales_from_the_Brothers_Gibb	rdf:type	schema:MusicAlbum ;
	dbo:abstract	"Tales from the Brothers Gibb: A History in Song is a box set compilation released by The Bee Gees in 1990. Originally released on four cassettes and four compact discs, Tales is a summary of the Bee Gees output from their third album, 1967's Bee Gees 1st to the group's most recent album (at the time), 1989's One. Considering the peculiar nature of the Gibbs' catalogue, the compilers neatly arranged each disc/cassette to represent the Bee Gees at different periods of their career called Chapters. Chapter I consists of songs from their folky/psychedelic era of 1967\u20131970; Chapter II covers the ballad heavy period of 1971\u20131974; Chapter III tracks the disco era from 1975\u20131979 and Chapter IV consists of the Gibbs' output in the 80's, including material from their two Warner Bros. albums. Many B-sides made their CD debut on Tales as well as solo material, unreleased tracks and live performances not available anywhere else. Album cuts, with a few exceptions, were not included here as to keep the focus on single releases. Several tracks received new stereo mixes prepared by Bill Inglot especially for this set. \"World\", \"I've Gotta Get a Message to You\" and \"Words\" are notable for the improved stereo mixes found on Tales. \"Tomorrow Tomorrow\" received its first stereo mix (the Best of Bee Gees 1986 CD featured the song in mono while the original 1969 Best of Bee Gees LP did not include the track), while many of the B-sides such as \"Sinking Ships\", \"Barker of the UFO\" and \"The Singer Sang His Song\" were mixed in stereo for the first time. The four live songs that ended the collection were taken from their highly successful \"All for One\" concert in Australia. That concert became available on CD in its entirety in 2014. The attractive packaging includes symbols for each song, photos taken in 1989 at a video shoot, and comments from one of the brothers on each song in the accompanying book. No historic photos were used."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"A Christmas Gift for You from Phil Spector (originally released as A Christmas Gift for You from Philles Records) is an album of Christmas songs, produced by Phil Spector, and originally released as Philles 45 in 1963. Spector treated a series of mostly secular Christmas standards to his trademark \"Wall of Sound\" treatment, and the selections feature the vocal performances of Spector's regular artists during this period. The album peaked at number 13 on Billboard magazine's special, year-end, weekly Christmas Albums sales chart in December 1963. The album was reissued by Apple Records in 1972, with different cover art\u2014a photograph of Spector dressed as a heavily bearded Santa Claus, wearing a \"Back to Mono\" button\u2014and retitled Phil Spector's Christmas Album. This version went to number 6 on Billboard's special Christmas Albums sales chart in December of that year, which was its highest chart ranking. It was also in 1972 that it made its debut on the UK charts. It would also re-chart in 1983 peaking at UK #19. In 2003, the album was voted 142 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time.[citation needed] Brian Wilson of the Beach Boys has cited this album as his favorite of all time.[better source needed] The album was included in Robert Dimery's 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Act II: The Meaning of, and All Things Regarding Ms. Leading is the second release and first full-length studio album by American progressive rock band The Dear Hunter, released on May 22, 2007 through Triple Crown Records. The album is the second part of a six-act story. Act II begins with the death of the innominate main character's mother, Ms. Terri. Following her death, he travels to a nearby bordello in the hopes of learning more about his mother and the life she lived as a prostitute, as he himself was the product of her profession. He eventually finds love in a prostitute named Ms. Leading, but the relationship eventually falls apart due to his inability to cope with her chosen profession. According to an interview with Casey Crescenzo for music website AbsolutePunk, the band wrote 120 minutes worth of music for the album, but managed to trim it down to just under 80 minutes to avoid having to do a double-disc release. The album features numerous re-recorded tracks from the Dear Ms. Leading demos. Although Casey based much of the demo's lyrics on personal experiences, he has stated that the arc of falling in love with a prostitute is not based on any experience he's actually had. In June 2007, artist Kent St. John was selected to illustrate a book based on the story of Act II. The progress of his contributions can be seen at his personal blog. The site was recently taken down, possibly due to the project being completed. The deluxe edition of The Dear Hunter's third album includes a 32 page booklet complete with illustrations."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Almost Human is the second studio album by Cuban American dark cabaret singer Voltaire, released on August 1, 2000 through Projekt Records. According to Voltaire on his official website, the album is intended to convey a \"look at life from the perspective of Lucifer\"; thus being, most of the album's tracks deal with existentialism, the human condition and the existence of God, in Voltaire's usual tongue-in-cheek humorous way. Also present in the album are covers of the traditional songs \"El Barquito de Nuez\" and \"Ringo no Uta\" \u2014 the first one was composed by famous Mexican songwriter Francisco Gabilondo Soler, while the second one was composed by Hachiro Sato and Tadashi Manjome for the 1945 film Soyokaze. They are fully sung in Spanish and Japanese, respectively. The song \"Almost Human\" is a song from the perspective of Lucifer, and \"Feathery Wings\" from the perspective of the Angel of Death. \"Anastasia\" references the fate of Russian princess Anastasia Nikolayevna. Voltaire originally wrote the track \"The Night\" in 1988; a more deathrock-inflected version of it would appear on his 2014 album Raised by Bats. The track \"Alchemy Mondays\" is a tribute to the eponymous goth event which used to take place at the famous, now-defunct music club CBGB, in Manhattan. Musician Myke Hideous of Misfits and The Bronx Casket Co. fame is also mentioned on the song's lyrics."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Both Sides Now is a concept album by Canadian singer-songwriter Joni Mitchell released in 2000. It is her seventeenth studio album. The album won two Grammy awards in 2001 for Best Traditional Pop Vocal Album and Best Instrumental Arrangement Accompanying Vocalist(s) for the song \"Both Sides, Now\". It traces the progress of the modern relationship through Mitchell's orchestral renditions of classic jazz songs. Two of Mitchell's own songs are also included, \"A Case of You\" (1971) and \"Both Sides, Now\" (1969). The orchestra was arranged and conducted by Vince Mendoza. In the liner notes, co-producer Larry Klein describes the album as \"a programmatic suite documenting a relationship from initial flirtation through optimistic consummation, metamorphosing into disillusionment, ironic despair, and finally resolving in the philosophical overview of acceptance and the probability of the cycle repeating itself\". A limited run of copies were released on February 8, 2000, in special chocolate-box packaging for Valentine's Day, including several lithographs of original Mitchell paintings. A regular jewel-case edition was released on March 20, 2000. Both Sides Now is also available on DVD-Audio. As of December 2007, the album has sold 323,000 copies in the United States[citation needed] On the concert tour tie-in to this album, Mitchell performed the songs in the same sequence, but opened with an overture, \"Nuages\" \u2014 the first movement from Nocturnes, an orchestral suite composed by French composer Claude Debussy. \"Nuages\" is the French word for \"clouds\". While the music certainly sets a romantic mood, the usage of this piece can be seen as a clever pun, since Clouds is also the name of the album on which the song \"Both Sides, Now\" made its original appearance. Both the album and the title song are featured in the film Love Actually (2003)."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Class of '55 is a 1986 album by rock and roll pioneers Johnny Cash, Jerry Lee Lewis, Roy Orbison and Carl Perkins. While the album was in part a tribute to Elvis Presley, it was mainly a commemoration of those young performing hopefuls, the four album participants, as had Presley, all began their careers with Sun Records in the 1950s. Recorded at Sam Phillips' Sun Studios and completed at American Sound Studios, the album was documented by Dick Clark Productions, which filmed it from start to finish; by The Commercial Appeal, the Mid-South's largest circulation newspaper; and by Nine-O-One Network Magazine, the first edition of which was sold with the album in a telemarketing package. The final song of the session, \"Big Train (from Memphis)\", written by John Fogerty, includes the blended voices of John Fogerty, The Judds, Dave Edmunds, Ricky Nelson, Sam Phillips, and June Carter Cash. Fogerty told a reporter that he was thinking about the old Sun Records sound when he wrote the song. The extended finale of the song features the singers singing lines from various Sun Records songs, including \"That's All Right Mama\", \"Blue Suede Shoes,\" \"Whole Lotta Shakin' Goin' On\", \"Folsom Prison Blues\" and others. Producer Chips Moman encountered a major issue following the recording sessions, as Cash was still under contract to Columbia Records at the time and proper permissions had not been obtained. Faced with the possibility of having to remove Cash's voice from the recordings, Moman paid Columbia $100,000 for the rights to keep Cash on the record. At this time, the America/Smash label was affiliated with PolyGram, which in turn also owned Mercury Records to which Cash would sign shortly after recording Class of '55. The recorded \"Interviews from the Class of '55 Recording Sessions\" earned the 1987 Grammy Award for Best Spoken Word Album for the four performers plus for producer Chips Moman, Sam Phillips and Ricky Nelson. For Nelson, it was his last recording session and only Grammy Award of his career. Cash, Lewis and Perkins had previously collaborated in 1956 with the Million Dollar Quartet and in 1982 with The Survivors Live. A TV special with footage of the studio sessions aired in 1989."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Conversation Peace is the 22nd album released by American musician Stevie Wonder, released on the Motown label in 1995. The album was Wonder's first full-length non-soundtrack studio album since 1987's Characters. This album yielded the hits \"For Your Love\" (a Grammy winner for Wonder for Best R&B Male Vocal Performance) and the reggae-flavored \"Tomorrow Robins Will Sing\". This album also saw Wonder reuniting with Robert Margouleff, who assisted during Wonder's \"classic period\" from 1972 to 1974. Wonder wrote about 40 songs in 1993 after being invited to stay for six weeks in Ghana by President Jerry John Rawlings. A number of these songs were eventually shaped into album form. Motown announced in August 1993 that Conversation Peace would be released later that year; however, Wonder continued to work on the album through 1994 until its release in March 1995, when Vibe magazine reported that the album had been in development \"off and on for at least the past four\" years."@en ;

Following the various line-up changes since the previous album From Chaos to Eternity in 2011, Dark Wings of Steel is the first album of the band to not feature guitarist and founding member Luca Turilli, the first with guitarist Roby De Micheli, and the only with bass guitarist Oliver Holzwarth. Due to Turilli writing the lyrics and co-composing the songs with keyboardist Alex Staropoli in the previous albums, the lyrics are written by singer Fabio Lione, with Staropoli now composing the music with his brother Manuel. Following the departure of other guitarist Tom Hess earlier in the year, the album also marks the return to one full-time guitarist only. Alex Staropoli stated: \"Fabio from now on will be in charge of writing the lyrics and I think this is really important for a singer to be able to write and sing its own lyrics\". He also noted about his brother Manuel: \"I knew my brother had lots of talent and he proved himself by submitting me with many great songs, which some of them I had to arrange and to use. I am so proud of him and there is a lot more to come\". The trailer for the album was released on October 11, 2013.

dbr:Devil_Without_a_Cause	rdf:type	schema:MusicAlbum ;
	dbo:abstract	"Devil Without a Cause is Kid Rock's fourth album. Produced by Kid Rock with John Travis, it was released in 1998 by Atlantic Records. It is Kid Rock's last album to be categorized as \"hip hop\" before crossing over to more traditional rock music. AllMusic labeled the album as a \"rap-rock masterpiece\". The album was certified 11 times Platinum by the RIAA by April 2003. It is Kid Rock's best-selling album, and as of December 2013, it has sold 9,300,000 copies in the US. Initially Atlantic Records was not sold on the idea of signing Kid Rock based on the strength of his material. Rock then entered the studio and cut a two-song demo tape featuring \"Somebody's Gotta Feel This\" and \"I Got One for Ya\" with Robert Bradley. Jason Flom immediately signed him and the band for $100,000 after hearing the tracks. The song \"Bawitdaba\" helped increase the popularity of nu metal along with the bands Limp Bizkit and Korn. This led to the success of new groups like Linkin Park, P.O.D., Papa Roach, Everlast and Saliva. \"Cowboy\" also aided in ushering in the then-new genre \"country rap\" or \"hick hop\". The song has gone on to influence Toby Keith, Blake Shelton, Trace Adkins, Big & Rich, Uncle Kracker, Gretchen Wilson, Jason Aldean, Brantley Gilbert, Eric Church, Rehab, Moonshine Bandits and Colt Ford. Originally \"Cowboy\", \"Devil Without a Cause\" and \"Only God Knows Why\" were rejected by Atlantic Records. The label did not understand a rap song about a cowboy and wanted him to take the \"I'm going platinum\" line out of the title track. \"Only God Knows Why\" was too country; they wanted a pure rock album. Rock wrote the first four lines of the song in jail after being arrested for a bar fight he got into while celebrating being signed to Atlantic. The song \"Wasting Time\" documented his frustrations with the label after he developed writer's block. Because of this he brought back four old tracks\u2014\"I Am the Bullgod\" from 1993's Fire It Up EP; \"Roving Gangster (Rollin)\", a demo left off Early Mornin' Stoned Pimp; as well as \"Where U at Rock\" and \"Black Chick, White Guy\" off EMSP. The album got its first exposure on the video game Road Rash 3D; it used \"Somebody's Gotta Feel This\". A chance meeting at a New York dance club with MTV VJ Carson Daly jump-started Rock's career ."@en ;

In addition, Bj\u00F6rk sings on \"Qmart\" and \"Ooops\", and is credited with co-writing the two songs. It is considered to be the first major release to feature the sample from the film Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory of the phrase \"we are the music makers\", which became one of the most common vocal samples in electronic music. It is also the first pop-oriented electronic-music album to feature guest vocals on a few tracks by important alternative rock artists, another thing that became commonplace on pop-oriented electronic-music albums."@en ;

Released on July 22, 1974 on the Tamla label, it is Wonder's nineteenth album overall, and seventeenth studio album. According to Billboard magazine, it was Wonder's first studio album to top the Pop Albums chart where it remained for two weeks, while it was his third album to top the R&B/Black Albums chart where it spent nine non-consecutive weeks. Subsequent to the epic sweep and social consciousness of Innervisions, this set projected a reflective, decidedly somber tone. The musical arrangements used in several songs while masterly could be considered sparse in comparison to others among his 1970s masterworks, evident especially in the bleak \"They Won't Go When I Go\" and understated \"Creepin. While largely a stripped down, more personal sounding record, Wonder had not completely foregone social commentary on the world around him. The No. 1 hit \"You Haven't Done Nothin'\" launched a pointed criticism of the Nixon administration[citation needed] bolstered by funky clavinet, drum machine, and a Jackson 5 cameo.[citation needed] The album received three Grammy Awards, including Album of the Year, in 1974."@en ;

It was the band's first studio album with new material in a decade (not counting the 1992 soundtrack to Bad Channels). American science fiction and horror writer John Shirley wrote lyrics for several songs on the album. While he is a noted author for his cyberpunk stories, many of the lyrics on this album revolve around early science fiction and mystery motifs. The album's working title was 'Ezekiel's Wheel', after the Biblical story that some take to reference an early visitation by UFOs. A number of songs on this album have ties to previous songs released within the circle of Blue \u00D6yster Cult. \"In Thee\" was originally featured on Mirrors. \"Still Burnin'\" is a sequel to the song \"Burnin' for You\" that appeared on Fire of Unknown Origin. The inspiration for the alternative cover is Morgan Fairchild.

The two songs did receive even more airplay in Europe. The song \"Hope\" became a theme song for the TJ Martell Foundation and was recorded by a group of country music stars in a fundraising effort for the Foundation. The recording of \"You Can Do Magic\" included here is not the hit version but a re-recording that is very similar. The version of Everyone I Meet is From California is a complete remake of the Dan Peek song California Revisited from their second album Homecoming It is the first America album since the departure of Dan Peek to resume the tradition of giving their albums titles beginning with \"H\", which had been their practice from Homecoming to Harbor. Three subsequent studio albums have continued this tradition before 2011's Back Pages broke with it once more.

Rahman has composed the original songs and score for the film. Being a period film, the music of film reflects the sounds during the 1920s pre-Independence Indian era. The album marks poet Vaali's last lyrical work for this A. R. Rahman musical film. Prior to recording the original songs, Rahman carried out a research for six months for the music. Majority of the tracks were recorded by nine months, beginning from October 2012. Every song in the film has an underlying concept that justifies the screenplay. The singles released prior to the album release were \"Vaanga Makka Vaanga\" and \"Yaarumilla\". The original version of the soundtrack album that released on August 18, 2014was aired through Suryan FM. The album met enthusiastic response from audience and positive critical acclaim. It topped the iTunes India charts. The Malayalam version of the soundtrack album Pradhi Nayagan was released on 31 October 2014."@en ;

dbr:Live_Alive	rdf:type	schema:MusicAlbum ;
	dbo:abstract	"For the anime episode see Haruhi Suzumiya. Live Alive is an electric blues album compiled from four live performances by Stevie Ray Vaughan and Double Trouble. The performances were recorded on July 16, 1985 at the Montreux Jazz Festival; July 17\u201318, 1986 at the Austin Opera House; and July 19, 1986 at Dallas Starfest. Much of the album was overdubbed in the studio. The 1985 Montreux performance was much better received than the 1982 visit, when some of the crowd booed Vaughan's hard blues sound. The song selection for Live Alive displays many of SRV's biggest influences: Jimi Hendrix (\"Voodoo Child (Slight Return)\"), Stevie Wonder (\"Superstition\"), Howlin' Wolf (\"Commit a Crime\"), and Buddy Guy (\"Mary Had a Little Lamb\"). \"I'm Leaving You (Commit a Crime)\" is incorrectly credited on the album to C. Burnett, better known as Howlin' Wolf. Although Howlin' Wolf was the first to record the song on the album The London Howlin' Wolf Sessions, it was written by James Oden. The title is also incorrect, because \"I'm Leaving You\" is a completely different song by Howlin' Wolf. The song was originally titled \"What a Woman!\", but was released in 1981 (after Wolf's death) as \"Commit a Crime\" on the album \"All Night Boogie\". It is not unlikely that the title used on Live Alive was an honest mistake, since the lyrics start with \"I'm leaving you woman, before I commit a crime\". When Kenny Wayne Shepherd recorded the song for his 1995 album Ledbetter Heights, he carried on the mistake and used Stevie Ray Vaughan's title for the song, and also credited Howlin' Wolf as the writer."@en ;

By this time, they had sufficient funds to fly all their equipment to the huge, state-of-the-art Ibiza Studios in Spain.

Using the style he pioneered with his work in Godflesh and now Jesu, Justin Broadrick reinterpreted the title track from Celestial into a new revision. It is presented on this EP as the closing track, an end to this chapter in the Isis discography considering the epic feel and experimental structure of the reworking that clearly foreshadows the direction the band would eventually take musically. The band has performed a version of the song \"Celestial\" live several times which fuses the original song and this remix together into a massive 16-minute rendition titled \"Celestial (Ext/Alt)\" on the Live.02 LP.

It's the first part of a trilogy of Thailand-influenced albums partially recorded in Bangkok, followed by SIREN and Technique of Relief. Due to the irresponsible nature of the Thai studio used and Hirasawa's lack of trust with their dealing with his gear, he only brought a small hard disk recorder to the country for work. Aiming for a caustic nuance, Hirasawa applied significant amounts of reverb to the album's sound. Some of the lyrics were written in Thai, although Hirasawa is not proficient in it; he cross-referenced four language guidebooks to write those lyrics, and was told by a singer that the meaning of what he wrote is completely different from what he wanted to convey."@en ;

They recorded Vol. One and Vol. Two in the same year and released them only a few months apart. Both albums are loose concept albums inspired by Art Alexakis' second divorce. The first one is more pop-based and melodic, the second angrier with a more punk/hard rock sound. It also focuses more on the destruction of relationships in its lyrical content. The album comes with a Parental Advisory sticker; the only other album by the band to feature one is 2006's Welcome to the Drama Club. \"Good Time For a Bad Attitude\" was seen as a disappointment compared to its predecessor. The album debuted at a disappointing 66 on the Billboard charts. No singles received any significant air play on radio or MTV and the album quickly fell out of memory. To date the album has only sold about 100,000 copies in the U.S. The album was certified Gold in Canada in February 2001. \"When It All Goes Wrong Again\", \"Out of My Depth,\" and \"Rock Star\" were the three songs released as singles from this album. \"When It All Goes Wrong Again\" was also featured on the soundtrack for the 2001 film Antitrust starring Ryan Phillippe while \"Rock Star\" was featured for the 2001 film of the same name starring Mark Wahlberg."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"The Bootleg Series Vol. 8: Tell Tale Signs: Rare and Unreleased 1989\u20132006 is a compilation album by singer-songwriter Bob Dylan in his official \"bootleg series\" of rare and unissued recordings. It was originally released as a double, and (limited edition) triple album. It was later released as a single album, consisting of disc one of the double set. The three-disc version of Tell Tale Signs includes a detailed 56 page book annotating the recordings by Larry Sloman, and a book of photos of \"The Collected Single Sleeves of Bob Dylan\" drawing on Dylan releases from around the world, plus a 7\" vinyl single with two tracks from the set: \"Dreamin' Of You\" and \"Ring Them Bells\". The album spans the recording sessions for Oh Mercy, World Gone Wrong, Time Out of Mind, and Modern Times as well as a number of soundtrack contributions and previously unreleased live tracks from 1989 through 2006. The collection also includes a track from an abandoned album Dylan had started to record with David Bromberg in 1992, and Dylan's duet with Ralph Stanley, 'The Lonesome River'. Although Under the Red Sky, Good as I Been to You and Love and Theft were all recorded during this time period, no tracks from these sessions are included on Tell Tale Signs. An alternate version of \"Series of Dreams\" was included on Vol. 3 of the Bootleg Series. \"Dreamin' Of You\", an outtake from the Time Out of Mind sessions, was offered for free download on Bob Dylan's site and was also sent to radio stations as a promotional single. In its first week it opened with #6 on the Billboard 200, selling over 600,000 copies to date and becoming Dylan's 17th album to open in the top 10. In the first week of October 2008, the entire album was made available in a free streaming format on National Public Radio's official website. CBS's announcement that the two-CD set would sell for $18.99 and the three-CD version for $129.99 drew charges of \"rip-off pricing\" from Dylan biographer Michael Gray and other critics."@en ;

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Vienna_(album)>	rdf:type	schema:MusicAlbum ;
	dbo:abstract	"Vienna is the fourth studio album by British new wave band Ultravox, first released on Chrysalis Records on 11 July 1980. The album was the first made by Ultravox with their best-known line-up, after Midge Ure had taken over as lead vocalist and guitarist following the departures of John Foxx and Robin Simon, and it was also the group's first release for Chrysalis. Vienna was produced by renowned German producer Conny Plank who had also produced Ultravox's previous album Systems of Romance, and mixed at Plank's studio near Cologne, Germany. The album had a slow start, but the release in January 1981 of the title track as the third single from the album heralded the band's commercial breakthrough worldwide and led to healthy sales throughout 1981. Vienna peaked at number 3 in the UK Albums Chart and reached the top ten in Australia, New Zealand and several European countries. Ultravox effectively changed pace, style and audience with the arrival of Ure, who had already participated in the formation of Visage with Currie. Many different styles are in use on the album; \"Astradyne\" is a long instrumental featuring sweeping, majestic synthesizer arrangements throughout, while \"Mr. X\" is a simpler, much sparser affair. The lyrics to the album's songs were mainly written by Ure and drummer Warren Cann, who also takes a rare lead vocal on \"Mr. X\". Vienna was remastered and re-issued on CD in 2000 on the EMI Gold label. This release also included a selection of B-sides from the album's singles as bonus tracks as well as the promotional video for the \"Vienna\" single. The definitive version of the Vienna album was released in 2008 and included a second disc of rare and previously unreleased tracks."@en ;

dbr:Welcome_to_Dun_Vegas	rdf:type	schema:MusicAlbum ;
	dbo:abstract	"Welcome To Dun Vegas is the third album by Scottish Celtic fusion group Peatbog Faeries, recorded in a cottage on the banks of Pool Roag, near Dunvegan, on the Isle of Skye, and released in 2003 on the band's own Peatbog Records label as the label's first release. The album was seen as an experimental work, like their previous album Faerie Stories although in a very different style. The album was composed and created by Peter Morrison (pipes, whistles), Innes Hutton (bass guitar), Thomas Salter (electric and acoustic guitars), Leighton Jones (keyboards), Roddy Neilson (fiddle) and Iain Copeland (percussion). Copeland also co-produced the album with Calum MacLean. The album features a new direction for the band, differing from their progressive-tinged d\u00E9but album Mellowosity (1996) and the subsequent electronica-tinged Faerie Stories (2001). The album features a wide range of influences, such as alternative rock and African music, as well as experimental effects including backwards drumming and a track based around a kitchen cooker timer. It also marked the first time the band used vocals, and whilst only a small amount is featured, five tracks include vocals, including guest contributions from vocal group The Veganites on the album's last two tracks. Some of the tracks from the album are about fictional historical stories. The album was released in April 2003 to positive reviews from critic, and the accompanying live tour also featured positive reviews. The track \"Wacko King Hako\" was often played live at the band's 2008 live shows, and was also included in the 2013 compilation album Larry Kirwan's Celtic Invasion. One description described the album as \"hard hitting Scottish fusion like you have never heard before.\""@en ;

Tour and was included on the One Nite Alone... Live! album. So therefore only live versions of \"Xenophobia\" are known, although a brief sample of the studio version was streamed on the NPG Music Club website in 2001.

It was released on March 23, 2007 by Epic Records. After including some Spanish songs on her first two albums, Lopez initially became interested in recording a full-length studio album in 2004 when she recorded a song with her then-husband Marc Anthony for his ninth studio album. After releasing her fourth studio album, Rebirth (2005), Lopez started working heavily on the album with Anthony, Est\u00E9fano and Julio Reyes in a period of two years and a half. Composed entirely of ballads, Como Ama una Mujer talks about love and heartbreak, being organic in its instrumentation and introspective in its lyrics. The album received generally mixed to negative reviews from music critics, with many praising her vocals for being more improved than her previous records, but thought the album was too serious and questioned a lack of highlights within the album. Commercially, the album became one of the first Spanish albums to debut inside the top-ten on the US Billboard 200 and the highest debut sales in the United States for a Spanish record. Elsewhere, it topped the Switzerland charts and became a top-ten album in other eight countries. Two singles were released from the album: \"Qu\u00E9 Hiciste\" and \"Me Haces Falta\". The first was released on January 26, 2007 and became a success in many countries, reaching number-one in Italy, Spain, Switzerland and on the US Hot Latin Songs, and a top-ten hit elsewhere, while the second single was released on March 23, 2007 but failed to make any impact on the charts.

The painting, Dazzle-ships in Drydock at Liverpool, is in the collection of the National Art Gallery of Canada in Ottawa, Canada. Dazzle Ships was the follow-up release to the band's hugely successful Architecture & Morality. OMD, then at their peak of popularity, opted for a major departure in sound on the record, shunning any commercial obligation to record \"Architecture & Morality number two\". The album is noted for its highly experimental content, particularly musique concr\u00E8te sound collages, utilising shortwave radio recordings to explore Cold War and Eastern Bloc themes. In contrast with its predecessor, Dazzle Ships met with a degree of critical and commercial hostility, but has gone on to be retrospectively hailed by critics as a \"masterpiece\" and a \"lost classic\" within popular music. The record has also been championed, and cited as an influence, by several modern artists."@en ;

John Milward, writing for Rolling Stone, wrote that it was Mitchell's \"best album since the mid-'70s\". The album marked her return to Warner Music (formerly WEA) distribution after her previous album, Night Ride Home, was distributed by MCA for its then-newly purchased subsidiary Geffen Records (which, prior to the sale to MCA, had distributed through WEA). The album takes inspiration from the Dutch artist Vincent van Gogh for Mitchell's self-portrait on the cover. The song \"Turbulent Indigo\" references Van Gogh, while the song \"Magdalene Laundries\" recounts the sufferings of Irish women once consigned to Magdalen Asylums run by the Roman Catholic Church and made to work in the asylum's laundries. The song \"Not to Blame\" was rumored to be about Mitchell's singer-songwriting colleague Jackson Browne who was alleged to have beaten his girlfriend, actress Daryl Hannah; Mitchell denies this.[citation needed]. The song \"Sex Kills\" referenced a number of late twentieth century topical issues, including violence, AIDS, global warming and consumerism. As of December 2007, the album has sold 311,000 copies in the US.[citation needed]"@en ;

dbr:Maxinquaye	rdf:type	schema:MusicAlbum ;
	dbo:abstract	"Maxinquaye is the debut album by English recording artist and producer Tricky. Assisted by co-producer Mark Saunders, Tricky recorded the album primarily at his home studio in London in 1994 with his then-girlfriend, singer Martina Topley-Bird, who shared vocals on most of the tracks with him. He incorporated dub production techniques, heavily altered samples, and elements of hip hop, soul, rock, ambient techno, reggae, and experimental music into the record's groove-oriented and low-tempo sound. The songs explore themes of dysfunctional sexual relationships, fear of intimacy, recreational drug use, and cultural decline, with lyrics inspired by Tricky's experiences in the British drug culture. His songwriting style and use of female vocalists such as Topley-Bird were influenced by his mother, Maxine Quaye, after whom the album was titled. When Maxinquaye was released on 20 February 1995 by 4th & B'way Records, it reached number three on the United Kingdom's album chart and sold over 100,000 copies in its first months of release. 4th & Broadway relied on independent record promoters and the British demographic of progressive, young music buyers rather than American markets for the record to perform well. A widespread critical success, Maxinquaye was cited by many critics as the year's best record and the key release of a musical style that was being dubbed trip hop at the time. Since then, it has been ranked frequently on all-time lists of the greatest albums and has sold over 500,000 copies worldwide."@en ;

It was released by DGC Records on April 12, 1994, just one week after frontwoman Courtney Love's husband, Kurt Cobain, was estimated to have died in their home. It was Hole's only album to feature bassist Kristen Pfaff before her death in June 1994. Recorded in October 1993, the album marked a divergence from the band's unpolished hardcore aesthetics to more refined melodies and song structure, and features production by Sean Slade and Paul Q. Kolderie, with mixing by Scott Litt and J Mascis. The album's lyrics and packaging reflect Love's preoccupation with beauty, and its songs contain repeated motifs of milk, motherhood, anti-elitism, and violence against women. The album's title is derived from a quote in Gone with the Wind. The album met near-unanimous critical acclaim upon release, earning top-100 chart spots in seven countries and going multi-platinum. It has been considered as a contemporary classic, and was included in Rolling Stone's list of \"500 Greatest Albums of All Time\". The album was also named the 84th greatest album of all time in a list produced by NME magazine in 2013.[citation needed] As of 2010, it has sold over 1.6 million copies in the United States."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"A Momentary Lapse of Reason is the thirteenth studio album by the English progressive rock group Pink Floyd, released in the UK and US in September 1987. It followed guitarist David Gilmour's decision to include material recorded for his third solo album on a new Pink Floyd album with drummer Nick Mason and keyboardist Richard Wright. Although for legal reasons Wright could not be re-admitted to the band, Wright and Mason helped Gilmour craft what became the first Pink Floyd album since the December 1985 departure of bass guitarist, singer, and primary songwriter Roger Waters. A Momentary Lapse of Reason was recorded primarily on Gilmour's converted houseboat, Astoria. Its production was marked by an ongoing legal dispute with Waters as to who owned the rights to Pink Floyd's name, an issue resolved several months after the album was released. Unlike many of Pink Floyd's studio albums, A Momentary Lapse of Reason has no central theme and is instead a collection of songs written by Gilmour, sometimes with outside songwriters. Though it received mixed reviews and was derided by Waters, A Momentary Lapse of Reason outsold Pink Floyd's previous album The Final Cut (1983) and was supported by a successful world tour. It has been certified quadruple platinum in the United States."@en ;

It was the first Sonic Youth album recorded at the band's own studio in Lower Manhattan, which was built with the money they had made at the 1995 Lollapalooza music festival. Since the band had an unlimited amount of time to work in their studio, the album features numerous lengthy and improvisional tracks that were developed unevenly. Three highly experimental extended plays, Anagrama, Slaapkamers met slagroom, and Invito al \u0109ielo, were recorded simultaneously with the album. Upon release, A Thousand Leaves reached No. 85 on the US Billboard Top 200 chart and No. 38 on the UK Albums Chart. The song \"Sunday\" was released as a single and as a music video directed by Harmony Korine and starring American actor Macaulay Culkin. The album received generally favorable reviews from music critics, who praised the lengthy and quiet guitar interplay between band members Thurston Moore and Lee Ranaldo. However, some critics criticized the forced vocal delivery of band member Kim Gordon and found several tracks to be unnecessarily long and poorly constructed."@en ;

dbr:All_Things_Must_Pass	rdf:type	schema:MusicAlbum ;
	dbo:abstract	"All Things Must Pass is a triple album by English musician George Harrison. Recorded and released in 1970, the album was Harrison's first solo work since the break-up of the Beatles in April that year, and his third solo album overall. It includes the hit singles \"My Sweet Lord\" and \"What Is Life\", as well as songs such as \"Isn't It a Pity\" and the title track that were turned down by the Beatles. The album reflects the influence of his musical activities with artists such as Bob Dylan, the Band, Delaney & Bonnie and Billy Preston during 1968\u201370, as well as Harrison's growth as an artist beyond his supporting role to former bandmates John Lennon and Paul McCartney. All Things Must Pass introduced Harrison's signature sound, the slide guitar, and the spiritual themes that would be present throughout his subsequent solo work. The original vinyl release consisted of two LPs of songs and a third disc of informal jams, titled Apple Jam. Commentators interpret Barry Feinstein's album cover photo, showing Harrison surrounded by four garden gnomes, as a statement on his independence from the Beatles. Production began at London's Abbey Road Studios in May 1970, with extensive overdubbing and mixing continuing through October. Among the large cast of backing musicians were Eric Clapton and Delaney & Bonnie's Friends band \u2013 three of whom formed Derek and the Dominos with Clapton during the recording \u2013 as well as Ringo Starr, Gary Wright, Preston, Klaus Voormann, John Barham, Badfinger and Pete Drake. The sessions produced a double album's worth of extra material, most of which remains unissued. All Things Must Pass was critically and commercially successful on release, with long stays at number 1 on charts around the world. The album was co-produced by Phil Spector and employs his Wall of Sound production technique to notable effect; Ben Gerson of Rolling Stone described the sound as \"Wagnerian, Brucknerian, the music of mountain tops and vast horizons\". Reflecting the widespread surprise at the assuredness of Harrison's post-Beatles debut, Melody Maker's Richard Williams likened the album to Greta Garbo's first role in a talking picture and declared: \"Garbo talks! \u2013 Harrison is free!\" According to Colin Larkin, writing in the 2011 edition of his Encyclopedia of Popular Music, All Things Must Pass is \"generally rated\" as the best of all the former Beatles' solo albums. During the final year of his life, Harrison oversaw a successful reissue campaign to mark the 30th anniversary of the album's release. Following this reissue, in March 2001, the set was certified six-times platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America. Among its appearances in critics' best-album lists, All Things Must Pass was ranked 79th on The Times' \"The 100 Best Albums of All Time\" in 1993, while Rolling Stone currently places it 433rd on the magazine's \"500 Greatest Albums of All Time\". In January 2014, All Things Must Pass was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame."@en ;

The DVD features all of the band's music videos to date, plus short films and live footage from as far back as 1986, whereas the bonus EP features five new songs written and recorded specifically for this release. When promoting the release, bassist Les Claypool remarked that \"It seems of late that bands are adding supplemental DVD material to their album releases to promote record sales. We've done the opposite. We've added a supplemental audio recording of brand new music to an extremely comprehensive DVD of classic visuals.\" Animals Should Not Try to Act Like People shows the return of drummer Tim Alexander to the lineup, who had previously left the band in 1996. He joins Claypool and LaLonde in performing on the EP, as well as providing commentary for the DVD. Claypool has claimed that two of the five new songs on the EP were written within the first 45 minutes of the lineup working together again, and \"Pilcher's Squad\" was said to have been written and recorded within a single afternoon.

	dbo:abstract	"Joe's Garage is a 1979 rock opera by Frank Zappa. Zappa self-deprecatingly described the album as a \"stupid little story about how the government is going to do away with music.\" Originally released as two separate studio albums on Zappa Records, the project was later remastered and reissued as a triple album box set, Joe's Garage, Acts I, II & III, in 1987. The story is told by a character identified as the \"Central Scrutinizer\" narrating the story of Joe, an average adolescent male, who forms a garage rock band, has unsatisfying relationships with women, gives all of his money to a government assisted and insincere religion, explores sexual activities with appliances, and is imprisoned. After being released from prison into a dystopian society in which music itself has been criminalized, he lapses into insanity. The album encompasses a large spectrum of musical styles, while its lyrics often feature satirical or humorous commentary on American society and politics. It addresses themes of individualism, free will, censorship, the music industry and human sexuality, while criticizing government and religion, and satirizing Catholicism and Scientology. Joe's Garage is noted for its use of xenochrony, a recording technique that takes guitar solos from older live recordings and overdubs them onto new studio recordings. All of the guitar solos on the album are xenochronous except for \"Crew Slut\" and \"Watermelon in Easter Hay\", a signature song that Zappa has described as the best song on the album, and according to his son Dweezil, the best guitar solo his father ever played. The album initially received mixed to positive reviews, with critics praising its innovative and original music, but criticizing the scatological, sexual and profane nature of the lyrics. Since its original release, Joe's Garage has been reappraised as one of Zappa's best works. This is Official Release #28 and #29."@en ;

It is their only studio album recorded with keyboardist Patrick Moraz in the band's line-up; he joined in August that year after Rick Wakeman left over differences regarding Tales from Topographic Oceans (1973) to pursue his solo career. Following Wakeman's decision to leave the band, the remaining members proceeded to work on new material for Relayer. The group wrote and rehearsed new songs and proceeded to record in Squire's home in Virginia Water, Surrey. The album saw Yes experiment with elements of funk and jazz fusion. Upon release, Relayer further developed the band's success in the mid-1970s, peaking at number 4 in the UK and number 5 in the U.S. The closing section of \"The Gates of Delirium\", titled \"Soon\", was released as a single in January 1975. The album is certified Gold by the Recording Industry Association of America."@en ;

Given the option to be involved in the project, Amos elected to take a central role in the production of the collection, released in 2003 on her former label Atlantic Records. Amos described the compilation as a \"sonic autobiography\", a title derived from her dislike of the term \"greatest hits\". Recording under the premise that a librarian is a \"chronicler\", Amos pieced together the collection in accordance with the Dewey Decimal System,[clarification needed] extending the librarian theme of the album. Amos revisited the mixing of many of her own favorite songs from her career, focusing on those she thought were not fully realized in their original recordings and those that she felt explained her life story. Additionally, Amos added two new songs and two re-recorded b-sides: \"Angels\", \"Snow Cherries from France\", \"Sweet Dreams\", and \"Mary\", respectively (the latter two compositions were originally recorded in 1990 during sessions for Little Earthquakes)."@en ;

ns32:_Volume_One	rdf:type	schema:MusicAlbum ;
	dbo:abstract	"The Honeydrippers: Volume One is an EP released on 24 September 1984, by a band led by rock singer Robert Plant. The project originated when Atlantic Records president Ahmet Erteg\u00FCn wanted to record an album of his favourite songs from the 1950s. Plant was chosen because Erteg\u00FCn had seen his pick-up band the Honeydrippers performing 1950s standards. Included in the band were Chic front man Nile Rodgers, and former Yardbirds guitarists Jeff Beck and Jimmy Page\u2014the latter was also Plant's former band mate in Led Zeppelin. To Plant's horror, \"Sea of Love\" became his biggest-selling single. According to Plant, the original single was \"Rockin' at Midnight,\" with \"Sea of Love\" as the \"B\" side. The single was eventually \"flipped\" because radio stations were playing \"Sea of Love\" far more than \"Rockin' at Midnight\". Plant feared his career would be ruined by this, and that people would think of him now as a \"crooner\", instead of the rock and roll singer he'd always been. As a result, when he would be asked about The Honeydrippers in years to come, Plant would refer to The Honeydrippers as having been \"put to sleep.\" \"Rockin at Midnight\" is a remake of the 1949 recording by Roy Brown, the song's author, who wrote it as an answer record to his 1947 composition and recording, \"Good Rockin' Tonight\". The album was re-released in a remastered edition in 2007 as part of a Robert Plant remaster series, with the live version of \"Rockin' at Midnight\" (previously released on the 12-inch single version of the studio recording) included as a bonus track. Plant and Erteg\u00FCn discussed the possibility of doing another Honeydrippers album, but with the latter\u2019s death in December 2006, the plan was shelved permanently."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Born on a Pirate Ship (sometimes abbreviated BOAPS) is the third full-length studio album by Barenaked Ladies (BNL), featuring the songs \"Shoe Box\", \"The Old Apartment\", \"When I Fall\" and \"Break Your Heart.\" \"The Old Apartment\" would become BNL's first US hit in 1997 and began the process of winning many new American fans. This was the first album recorded following the departure of keyboardist Andy Creeggan, who had considered leaving before the recording of their previous album, Maybe You Should Drive. BOAPS was recorded as a four-piece. Kevin Hearn is not credited on the album, but joined the group for the 1995 tour that preceded the album's release in time to be thanked in the liner notes for \"injecting new spirit.\" Steven Page and Ed Robertson returned to writing together, as they did upon the band's formation, but had abandoned following the release of Gordon, Tracks recorded for this album but left off the finished record are: \"Trust Me\" (earlier recorded for Maybe You Should Drive but left off the album\u2014included on the Shoe Box EP) and \"Back\" (included on the \"Brian Wilson 2000\" single). As with each of their early albums, the band recorded one song, \"Back\", completely naked. The front cover features a boy in a newspaper hat pulling at his cheeks, in reference to the childhood prank alluded to by the album's title. (For those not acquainted with this prank, having someone say \"I was born on a pirate ship\" while pulling their cheeks outwards makes them sound like they are saying \"I was born on a pile of shit\".) Contrary to popular belief, this is not a childhood picture of BNL bassist Jim Creeggan, but simply a child actor hired for the photos. The album is also an enhanced CD. The data track contains audio samples from the band's previous two CDs, a short montage of press photos, several of the band's music videos, a short trivia quiz, and a pair of \"behind the scenes\" videos from the band. Similar content was included and expanded upon on the Shoe Box E.P.; however, the format of the enhanced CD used in the creation of that CD renders the data track inaccessible on modern operating systems. Although a moderate #18 hit in Canada, the album only managed #111 in the US. Born On A Pirate Ship was awarded gold status in the U.S. in 2000, after the band became more popular there."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"El Oso (Spanish for The Bear), released in 1998 (see 1998 in music), is the third and final album by the New York City band Soul Coughing. The disc is marked by a deep drum and bass influence. Before starting work on the album, the band toured with Full Cycle DJs Krust and Die (in fact, their band with Roni Size, Reprazent, won the Mercury Prize in 1997 and thus put the kibosh on a notion to have them produce)\u2014and by a scattershot approach to production: Tchad Blake (Soul C's Ruby Vroom, Latin Playboys, Sheryl Crow), Pat Dillett (They Might Be Giants, Doveman, Mary J. Blige), and British drum and bass DJ Optical (Goldie, Grooverider, Ed Rush). Artist Jim Woodring (Frank) drew the cartoon \"monkey-bear\" on the disc's cover. The chorus of the song \"$300\" is a sample of a Chris Rock joke; singer Mike Doughty heard the joke which is backmasked on Rock's Roll with the New. Curious, Doughty recorded it into his ASR-10 sampler with the intention of simply reversing it and seeing what the joke was, and wrote the song around what he found there. The song was used in the House episode \"The Softer Side\" in 2009. The disc yielded Soul Coughing's biggest hit single, \"Circles\". Tchad Blake, who produced the tune, hated it, and told them it would be a mistake to release it. Cartoon Network gave it a music video in which a Flintstones cartoon was synched to the track as part of the Cartoon Network Groovies. The music video featured Flintstone and other Hanna-Barbera cartoon characters walking in front of the same repeating background. A Cartoon Network video for the song \"Rolling\" was also produced, which was synced with a Betty Boop cartoon. The song was used in the 2004 remake of Walking Tall. El Oso made #1 on KTUH's charts on the week of January 25, 1999."@en ;

The band initially planned for Tchad Blake, producer of their first album, Ruby Vroom, to produce the album, but the death of a family member in a car accident caused Blake to take a hiatus. Over the objections of his bandmates and his record label, Slash Records/Warner Bros., frontman Mike Doughty (then billed as \"M. Doughty\") hired producer David Kahne (Fishbone, The Bangles, Sublime, Tony Bennett, Sugar Ray, The Strokes); he was intent on following up the wild sonics of Ruby Vroom with a tightly-wound, trembly, New Wave inspired record. The tracking, at Manhattan's Power Station recording studio, was complete in eleven days, and Doughty was jubilant at the results. Doughty tapped Steve Fisk to produce the tune \"Unmarked Helicopters\" for The X Files soundtrack Songs in the Key of X. All of Irresistible Bliss' songs were produced by Kahne, except tracks 2 and 6 (by Fisk) and track 12 by the band themselves. The mixing process split the tracks between three mixers: Kahne, Chris Shaw, and Ruby producer Tchad Blake, who intervened when bass player Sebastian Steinberg briefly quit the band. Irresistible Bliss yielded a hit single for Soul Coughing, \"Super Bon Bon\". \"Soft Serve\" and \"Soundtrack to Mary\" also received some selective radio airplay."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Rock Spectacle is the first live album by Barenaked Ladies. It was the first major success for the band in the United States, selling over one million copies and producing a hit single in its version of \"Brian Wilson.\" The album was recorded at two concerts at the Riviera Theatre in Chicago and at The Olympia in Montreal during the Born on a Pirate Ship tour. A live version of \"Shoe Box\" was on promotional and advance copies of this record, but was left off at the last second. The recording would later be released on the \"One Week\" CD single. The album contains two bonus tracks. The first is a banter about an elderly woman Ed Robertson ran into in Chicago. Part of this story is referenced in \"If I Had $1000000\", which must have originally occurred after this banter at the Chicago concert. The second is an improvised song/rap about Robertson's Uncle Elwyn. This disc is an enhanced CD, which means it will display special multimedia features when played on a computer. It includes a program called \"BNLTV\", a faux collection of various-themed TV programming."@en ;

dbr:Ruby_Vroom	rdf:type	schema:MusicAlbum ;
	dbo:abstract	"Ruby Vroom was Soul Coughing's 1994 debut album. The album's sound is a mixture of sample-based tunes (loops of Raymond Scott's \"Powerhouse\" on \"Bus to Beelzebub\", Toots and the Maytals, Howlin' Wolf, The Andrews Sisters, and The Roches on \"Down to This\", and a loop of sampler player Mark De Gli Antoni's orchestral horns on \"Screenwriter's Blues\", among others). It also features guitar-based tunes like \"Janine\", \"Moon Sammy\", and \"Supra Genius\" and jazzy, upright-bass-fueled songs that often slyly quoted other material\u2014the theme from Courageous Cat on \"Is Chicago, Is Not Chicago\", Thelonious Monk's \"Misterioso\" on \"Casiotone Nation\", and Bobby McFerrin's cover of Joan Armatrading's \"Opportunity\" on \"Uh, Zoom Zip\". The album's lone guest is Rachel Benbow Murdy, band founder Mike Doughty's ex-girlfriend, who supplies a vocal on \"Janine\". Doughty had Murdy go out to a payphone in Sheridan Square in New York and improvise a long, meandering song into their answering machine. Recorded a year before the Ruby sessions, Doughty and bass player Sebastian Steinberg recorded the tune at the avant-garde jazz club The Knitting Factory during the daytime, when the club was closed, with club soundperson James McLean. McLean put a mic on the answering machine, which Doughty had brought to the session. Ruby was named after Ruby Froom, daughter of record producer Mitchell Froom\u2014a frequent collaborator of Ruby Vroom producer Tchad Blake\u2014and singer/songwriter Suzanne Vega. The album was recorded at Sunset Sound Factory in Hollywood, Blake and Froom's usual haunt\u2014a storage room near the studio's lounge was filled with vintage keyboards and road cases filled with toys\u2014whistles, baby rattles, children's toy xylophones. Many of these ended up in the songs, such as a train whistle played by Doughty on \"Uh, Zoom Zip\". This was in keeping with Tchad Blake's spirit of maverick experimentation, which included sticking a binaural head-shaped microphone in front of Yuval Gabay's drumkit, sticking a mic in a car muffler, called \"the Bone\" and sticking that in the drum booth as well, and having Doughty improvise wild, yelling ad-libs on \"Casiotone Nation\", singing into a cheap amplification system called an Ahuja that Blake bought in India. The speaker was essentially a huge bullhorn atop a stick."@en ;

Ministry did perform the song several times in concerts in the late 1980s, but it was never released or recorded officially.

It was his first release through RCA, which would be his label for the next decade. Hunky Dory has been described by AllMusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine as having \"a kaleidoscopic array of pop styles, tied together only by Bowie's sense of vision: a sweeping, cinematic m\u00E9lange of high and low art, ambiguous sexuality, kitsch, and class\". The album has received critical acclaim since its release, and is regarded as one of Bowie's best works. Time chose it as part of their \"100 best albums of all time\" list in January 2010, with journalist Josh Tyrangiel praising Bowie's \"earthbound ambition to be a boho poet with prodigal style\". The style of the album cover, designed by George Underwood, was influenced by a Marlene Dietrich photo book that Bowie took with him to the photo shoot."@en ;

dbr:No_Need_to_Argue	rdf:type	schema:MusicAlbum ;
	dbo:abstract	"No Need to Argue is the second studio album by Irish rock band The Cranberries, released in 1994. It was the band's most successful album, and has sold about 17 million copies worldwide. It contains the band's most successful single to date, \"Zombie\". The album's mood is darker and harsher than that on Everybody Else Is Doing It, So Why Can't We?, released a year before. It shows a more mature performance by lyricist and vocalist Dolores O'Riordan, writing about war, death, love and disappointment. Her voice is clearer, without the previous album's double and triple voice layering. In some of the songs, the band decided to take on a rockier and heavier side, using distortion and increasing the volume. The song \"Yeats' Grave\" \u2013 incorrectly listed on the album as \"Yeat's Grave\" and never corrected for any of the album's physical re-releases \u2013 is about William Butler Yeats, and quotes one of his poems, No Second Troy. The song \"Zombie\", written by lead singer Dolores O'Riordan, is according to her about the IRA bombings in 1993 that resulted in the death of two children. For the sleeve design, Art Director Cally re-enlisted photographer Andy Earl and hired the same sofa that featured on the debut album. The sofa was transported by hand to many locations in and around Dublin including Dalkey Island, coming to rest in a photo-studio in Dublin where the white room had been constructed for the cover shot. Whilst travelling around Dublin in a bus: band and sofa aboard, the bus was shot at, the bullet piercing a side window but missing all on board.The band, somewhat influenced by a recent Blur photo, decided to dress up and wear suits. The hand lettering was by Charlotte Villiers; video co-ordinator at Island Records and distant relative of the Villiers engine manufacturing family. Each single sleeve featured the band on the sofa in a different location. The sofa went on to star in the video 'Alright' by the British band Supergrass."@en ;

The album marked the departure of Jonathan Donahue (to Mercury Rev) and Nathan Roberts, and the addition of guitarist Ronald Jones and drummer Steven Drozd. The EP Due to High Expectations... The Flaming Lips Are Providing Needles for Your Balloons was released the following year to promote the album and featured live versions of \"Chewin the Apple of Your Eye\" and \"Slow\u2022Nerve\u2022Action\". The EP's cover art was also similar to that of Transmissions from the Satellite Heart.

Once signed she began the process of recording her self-titled studio album and recorded the album between the time period of 1997\u201398 at Silent Sound Studios in Atlanta, Georgia and at The Record Plant in Los Angeles, California. Production was primarily handled by Darryl \"Day\" Pearson with additional contributions from Daryl Simmons and Nokio the N-Tity. During the process of making the album, Harrison co-wrote five of the twelve tracks featured on the album; a pivotal role she would continue to play in her career. Prior to recording the album, Harrison had no vocal training and often would record her ad-libs on the spot in the studio. Guest features included Dru Hill front man Sisq\u00F3, No Limit rapper Silkk the Shocker, and Virginia native Missy Elliott. The album spawned three hit singles; two Top 5 Hot R&B Singles \"It's All About Me\" featuring Sisq\u00F3, \"Movin' On\" featuring No Limit rapper Silkk the Shocker and the Diane Warren/Babyface-penned ballad \"My First Night with You\". M\u00FDa debuted at number seventy-seven on Billboard 200 album chart on May 9, 1998 and later peaked at number twenty-nine on September 5, 1998. With the help of its three singles, it spent 53 non-consecutive weeks on Billboard 200 album chart and earned a platinum certification from Recording Industry Association of America within the next six months on October 1, 1998. The album received critical acclaim from music critics and earned Harrison several accolades, including a NAACP Image Award nomination and two Soul Train Music Award nominations."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Return to Base is the eighth album by the British rock group Slade. It was released on 1 October 1979 by Barn Records, and did not enter any national album charts. At the time of the album's release, the band's success had waned and were receiving little fortune. Forced to play at small halls and clubs around the UK, the only income they were reliant on was Noddy Holder and Jim Lea's songwriting royalties. Their recent singles had sold poorly and they were no longer drawing in large audiences. At the time of their last-minute call up for the 1980 Reading Festival, they were on the verge of disbanding and had only a couple of their road crew to help them on the day. \"We had to pay to park in the public area,\" recalled Jim Lea incredulously. \"With no roadies, we had to carry our own gear and there was even trouble getting into the backstage area!\" The band's previous album, Whatever Happened to Slade (1977), featured a \"straight\" hard rock sound, dropping the band's glam rock image, and despite critical acclaim, had brought the band little commercial fortune. Return to Base was conceived as a continuation of the band's sound, and an attempt to raise the band's fortune. The band aimed to record twenty songs, with the best eleven being put onto the album. In the 1979 July\u2013August fan club magazine, drummer Don Powell confirmed that seventeen tracks had been recorded at the time. However, whilst the critical reaction to the album was generally positive, the album sold poorly, something partially blamed on Barn Records, who only pressed a total 3,500 copies of the album's lead single \"Ginny, Ginny\", virtually guaranteeing its failure to enter the charts. Even the single that preceded it, \"Sign of the Times\" failed to chart and most copies which were left were melted down, making the single extremely rare today. Some of the tracks from Return to Base were included on Slade's successful next album We'll Bring the House Down. The remainder tracks from Return to Base were included as bonus tracks on the 2007 \"Feel the Noize\" remaster of We'll Bring The House Down. As such, the album was the band's only album not to be included in that series of remastered releases. The album peaked at #830 for 1979 on rateyourmusic."@en ;

The songs \"Breakdown\", \"Fallen\", \"(The Transient) Truth\", \"White Love\", and \"Why Don't You Take Me\" were released as singles or 12\" singles before the album came out and were very popular, building anticipation for the album which was delayed because of label politics. Although the album was received very well, NME felt that the pull of influence between the more commercial orientated producer Stephen Hague and the indie Weatherall created a somewhat confused sound, that if the band had gone more with Weatherall's sound and not let London records man Hague have such influence then the album might have had a more clear direction in terms of sound.NME made specific comparisons of the early single releases with their much more clubby sound and the sometimes muddy pace of the album; ultimately though it was well received. The album was originally to have been titled Sound, but this was changed shortly before release. \"Morning White Dove\" was the Native American name of Elvis Presley's maternal great-great-great-grandmother. Their second album was practically complete by 1996 but due to internal conflicts and persistent label conflict the band disbanded. As of 2012 it remains to be released."@en ;

Taking over 10 months to finalise, many of the tracks on the album have been part of Lakeman's live set since the second half of 2006, the initial tracks performed being 'Poor Man's Heaven' and 'Race to be King', but this expanded towards the end of the tour, with new tracks continuing to be previewed throughout 2007 and into 2008. Many songs on the album have, by Lakeman's own admission, a rockier sound than his earlier, arguably more straightforwardly acoustic folk, material. The transition into this sound could be argued to originate in the live versions of the Freedom Fields tracks from the respective tour, since many of them had a rockier element added (most notably on the chorus on 'The Colliers'). Indeed, Lakeman said that the decision to release the Poor Man's Heaven EP was partly to introduce this new direction to his listeners. While acknowledging the shift to a rockier emphasis, Lakeman denies that the album is any less acoustic or more electric than his earlier material, pointing out that all the tracks are still almost exclusively performed on acoustic instruments."@en ;

It is possible that the titles of these albums imply a continuity of the American classical tradition begun by Aaron Copland in Appalachian Spring.[citation needed] In its June 1997 issue, Bass Player magazine named it one of \"30 Essential Bass Albums You Must Own\", due to Meyer's exceptional work on the album.

The album was released in 1989, and reached Gold certification. This album also represented a hint of future album releases...95% of the songs were not written/co-written by Manilow, which had up until that point been rare. Manilow, known for being a composer, typically always stocked his albums with material he co-wrote with his celebrated lyricists. After the release of this album, the 1990s dawned and a new era in his career began as he embarked on introducing contemporary audiences to pop music of the 1930s through the late 1940s. This album is also one of his longest of original material, clocking in at nearly an hour. There are few up-tempo songs, favoring ballads of which he is known to perform.

The success of Beautiful Midnight propelled Good to a celebrity status in Canada he eventually grew to loathe, and his interactions with the media throughout the promotional cycle for the record were often strained and unpleasant. The album was re-released in 2001 in the United States on Atlantic Records with an altered track listing with remixed songs from Underdogs. Good has referred to it as something of a greatest hits. The album did not achieve the kind of success in America as it did in Canada due to Good intentionally sabotaging the band's career stateside by refusing to play along with the media and music industry in the country and the band's reluctance to commit extensively touring the country. A number of songs considered for inclusion on Beautiful Midnight were relegated to b-side or unreleased status. \"Flashdance II\" was eventually released on Loser Anthems, while \"Pony Boy\", which was recorded for the subsequent album The Audio of Being, remained unreleased until In a Coma in 2005."@en ;

It was the band's first studio album since \"The Spaghetti Incident?\" (1993), and their first album of original studio material since the simultaneous releases of Use Your Illusion I and II in September 1991. Despite debuting at number three on the Billboard 200 and being certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), Chinese Democracy domestically undersold expectations. It received generally favorable reviews from music critics. The album achieved international chart success and has sold over one million copies in Europe. In 1994, Guns N' Roses' progress on a follow up to \"The Spaghetti Incident?\" was halted due to creative differences between members, Slash, Duff McKagan, Matt Sorum, and Gilby Clarke all resigned or were fired from the band in the mid '90s. Vocalist Axl Rose and keyboardist Dizzy Reed were the only members from the previous lineup remaining by the time production had started. A new lineup, consisting of Rose, Reed, guitarists Robin Finck and Paul Tobias, bassist Tommy Stinson, drummer Josh Freese, and keyboardist Chris Pitman began working on the album in 1997. Initially intended to be released in 1999 or 2000, the album was re-recorded completely in 2000. The album was worked on by multiple lineups of the band, including later members Bryan Mantia, Buckethead, Richard Fortus, Ron \"Bumblefoot\" Thal, and Frank Ferrer. Personnel and legal reasons, as well as Rose's alleged perfectionism caused the album to be delayed multiple times, including missing an announced March 2007 release date, before being released in November 2008. With production costs reportedly eclipsing $13 million, the album is the most expensive rock album ever produced."@en ;

Track two is a House remix by Stevie Dachau, containing elements of various tracks from Turn Loose the Swans, most prominently \"The Songless Bird\". The final track is a remix of the Turn Loose the Swans track \"The Crown of Sympathy\"."@en ;

Hans Zimmer initially denied popular rumours that he would be composing the film's soundtrack. However, in June 2012, it was confirmed that Zimmer would in fact be writing the film's musical score. To completely distinguish Man of Steel from the previous films, the iconic \"Superman March\" by John Williams is not heard. The musical score from the third trailer, entitled \"An Ideal of Hope\", was released online for listening purposes on April 19, 2013. This music was a shortened version of the album track \"What Are You Going to Do When You Are Not Saving the World?\". In late April 2013, the official track listing of the two-disc deluxe edition was revealed.

The album was recorded in Paris, France, and originally released in 1945. On January 25, 1945, Reinhardt recorded four tunes with Bernie Privin on trumpet, Peanuts Hucko on tenor saxophone, Mel Powell on piano, Josz Schulman on bass and Ray McKinley on drums. In addition to these four tracks, the album included four tracks of Hucko playing clarinet with a trio, and several tracks of Powell on solo piano. Miller's band members were all members of the United States Army Air Forces, and military regulations prohibited them from making commercial recordings. This led to a curious personnel listing on the original album that mentioned only Django Reinhardt by name. His accompanists were called the Jazz Club Mystery Hot Band, and the members were listed as U, V, W, X, Y and Z. Later reissues properly credited Glenn Miller's All Stars, the Ray McKinley Trio and Mel Powell."@en ;

Recording Company in Seattle, Washington by Phil Ek. Stylistically, the album was marked by its experimentation with longer song structures, philosophical lyrics, and the incorporation of cello. The album was essentially recorded three times. The first time, Martsch attempted to play all the instruments except drums. He and Phil Ek were dissatisfied with the results, so Martsch brought in Nelson and Plouf and recorded the album again. However, these tapes were destroyed by heat when Ek was driving from Seattle to Boise to record additional overdubs. The band rehearsed some more, then recorded the album a third time. In September 2008, the band embarked on a three-month tour to perform the album in its entirety. The tracks on the album are (in general) significantly longer than those on There's Nothing Wrong With Love, the shortest track being 4 minutes and 52 seconds long (only 2 tracks on their previous album were longer than 4:52)."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"She's the Boss is the solo album debut by The Rolling Stones frontman Mick Jagger released in 1985. When the Stones signed with CBS Records in 1983, one of the options available to them was for individual projects, and Jagger eagerly began working on She's the Boss. Following the release of Undercover, Jagger began composing material for his first solo project, sanctioning the help of various musician friends in the studio when recording began in May 1984. Of those involved were Pete Townshend, Jeff Beck, Carlos Alomar, Herbie Hancock, and the Compass Point Allstars, while Jagger would share production duties with Bill Laswell and Nile Rodgers. Keith Richards, Jagger's longtime musical partner in the Rolling Stones, was not pleased that Jagger was pursuing solo work, feeling that their band should be each other's first priority. The growing friction between both musicians would erupt publicly in 1986, before they resolved their differences a couple of years later. She's the Boss was released in February 1985 \u2013 preceded by its lead song \"Just Another Night\". Both the album and its first single became worldwide hits, with \"Just Another Night\" reaching No. 1 on the US Mainstream Rock chart and No. 12 on the US pop chart, and She's the Boss going to No. 6 in the UK and No. 13 in the US, where it went platinum. Follow-up single \"Lucky in Love\" would be a Top 40 US hit. The video for \"Hard Woman\" extensively utilised a Cray supercomputer for its animation, making it one of the most expensive music videos made to that point in time. The success of the album \u2013 impacted by Jagger's solo appearance at Live Aid that July and his rush-recorded duet hit cover of \"Dancing in the Street\" with David Bowie \u2014 influenced Jagger to record a successor, Primitive Cool, which would be released in 1987. Although originally released by CBS, She's the Boss was acquired and reissued by Atlantic Records in 1993 following the release of Jagger's third album, Wandering Spirit. In 1986, Jamaican reggae singer Patrick Alley attempted to sue Jagger over the song \"Just Another Night,\" which Alley claims he had recorded in 1979 and released on his 1982 album, A Touch of Patrick Alley. Alley claimed that Sly Dunbar (who played drums on She's the Boss) also played on his recording. The case was cleared in 1988, with Jagger stating \"My reputation is really cleared. If you're well known, people stand up and take shots at you.\""@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Tha Carter IV is the ninth studio album by American rapper Lil Wayne, released on August 29, 2011 through Young Money Entertainment, Cash Money Records and Universal Republic Records. Recording sessions for the album began in late 2008, shortly after Lil Wayne's sixth studio album, Tha Carter III (2008) was released to strong sales and critical acclaim: however, the sessions were put on hold, as Lil Wayne claimed he did not want to follow an album he held in high regard so quickly with another, potentially inferior release. In the interim, Lil Wayne released his two other albums in 2010: the largely rock-themed Rebirth, and I Am Not a Human Being. The latter was reportedly composed from unreleased material from the original Tha Carter IV sessions, as the album was released whilst Wayne served a prison sentence at Rikers Island prison for illegal possession of a weapon, and was thus unable to record any new material: this also meant Tha Carter IV's recording sessions were once more put on hold. Following Wayne's release from prison, the album was re-recorded from scratch. The recording sessions resumed at various locations, involving several record producers including Bangladesh, Detail, T-Minus, Noah \"40\" Shebib, Polow da Don, Jim Jonsin, Kane Beatz, Boi-1da, Willy Will, StreetRunner, Cool & Dre, Young Ladd, The Smeezingtons, and Kanye West. The album's largely concerns the themes of sex, violence, drugs and crime, but also love, hurt and emotional conflict. Appearances on the album include Cory Gunz, Drake, T-Pain, Tech N9ne, Andre 3000, Rick Ross, John Legend, Bruno Mars, Birdman, Kevin Rudolf, Jadakiss, Bun B, Nas, Shyne, and Busta Rhymes. Following a heavily delayed release, Tha Carter IV was released to digital retailers at midnight on August 28, 2011, following Wayne's scheduled performance at the MTV Video Music Awards, and physical retailers received the album the following day. Tha Carter IV achieved first week sales of 964,000 copies in the United States and became Lil Wayne's second album to top the US Billboard 200 in its first week. The album received generally mixed reviews from music critics, who were divided in their responses towards the album's production and Wayne's own performances on the album: they felt it a disappointment compared to his previous work. The entire album according to Lil Wayne is an allegory of the negative aspects of the West."@en ;

The album was certified Platinum by the BPI and achieved sales over one million globally. In Canada it was the 100th most successful album of the year. The title track was released as the lead single of the album and was followed up by a cover of Shep and the Limelites 1961 US doo-wop hit, \"Daddy's Home\". The singles peaked at number 4 and 2 respectively on the UK singles chart. \"Daddy's Home\" was held off number 1 for 4 weeks running by the Human League's \"Don't You Want Me\", but earned gold certification from the BPI for sales over half a million. The track was recorded live on 1 May 1981 at the Hammersmith Odeon for a rock 'n' roll special to be broadcast later by BBC Television. \"Broken Doll\" is a cover of a Wreckless Eric single from 1980. Reportedly, Richard also wanted to record Eric's \"(I'd Go The) Whole Wide World\" too, but only if he could change some of the lyrics - which Eric refused. \"Young Love\" was given new lyrics and retitled \"The Last Kiss\" for a cover version by David Cassidy with George Michael. It was released as the lead single for Cassidy's 1985 album Romance, becoming a top ten hit in the UK and Germany. \"Once in a While\" was originally recorded by Leo Sayer on his 1980 album Living in a Fantasy and was also released as a single in the UK and Australia. The promotional video for the title track is one of Richard's best-known, and was filmed around the centre of Milton Keynes, the new town in Buckinghamshire that was developed after the Second World War. It features Richard walking around and on rollerskates while listening to music on a then brand new Walkman cassette player.

It was released on 24 March 2003 by Warp Records. 26 Mixes for Cash was released on CD only, although a vinyl promotional disc entitled 2 Mixes on a 12\" For Cash, featuring the two Aphex Twin originals exclusive to this compilation, was released in limited quantities in Japan only. Along with the 22 remixes on this release, four original Aphex Twin tracks are also included. Two are new versions of previously released tracks: \"Windowlicker, Acid Edit\" and \"SAW2 CD1 TRK2, Original Mix\". The other two were previously available only on Further Down the Spiral, the remix album by US industrial rock band Nine Inch Nails: \"The Beauty of Being Numb Section B\" and an edited version of \"At the Heart of It All\". In addition to the remixes featured on this release, James has also remixed tracks by Beck, DJ Pierre, and Soft Ballet, as well as additional remixes of tracks by Seefeel, Gavin Bryars, Jesus Jones, Saint Etienne, and Mescalinum United. Online orders of the compilation through Warp Records came with two silver-wrapped chocolate coins, featuring the Aphex Twin logo on one side and Richard's profile on the other (with \"ELECTRONICA REX\" written alongside it). In the comments of a song he had posted on SoundCloud, Richard James said the album was not named \"26 Mixes for Cash\" out of sarcasm like most people perceive, but rather because he exchanged the DATs for cash rather than with credit/debit cards, so that the record companies wouldn't know his bank account details or address. He also stated that it wasn't named by him, but rather by the late Warp Records co-founder Rob Mitchell."@en ;

The first recording sessions for Bleed Like Me took place in March 2003, but were mostly unproductive due to passive aggression between the band members, and a general lack of direction. As Garbage struggled to create the album, the band quietly split for four months starting October 2003. They reunited under producer John King in Los Angeles, and following a guest appearance by Dave Grohl on \"Bad Boyfriend\", the band found a renewed focus on production. Garbage recruited drummer Matt Walker and bassist Justin Meldal-Johnsen for new recording sessions, and completed the album by the end of 2004. Following critical praise and high chart positions for its lead single \"Why Do You Love Me\", Bleed Like Me had a strong opening week globally, debuting in the top five in eight countries, including the United Kingdom, Australia, and the United States."@en ;

Originally, it had started out as a solo record, but when Young played it for Reprise executives they asked him if he wouldn't mind adding rhythm tracks to what he already had. Young agreed to this, and the end product was the Comes a Time that was released. Two songs had Young backed by Crazy Horse, resulting in them having a rawer sound than the smooth production of the rest of the album. \"Human Highway\" was written several years prior to its release, and originally presented to Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young in 1974 for a proposed studio album by the group which never came to be. Much of the album features harmony vocals from Nicolette Larson. She also shares lead with Young on \"Motorcycle Mama\". For years, it was rumored that Young had purchased some 200,000 copies of the album because he was unhappy with the sound, owing to damage that occurred to the master tape during shipment to the mixing facility. The version of the album now available was personally remixed by Young from the safety copy of the original master. In a March 2014 interview with Rolling Stone, Young revealed that he in fact used the 200,000 LPs as shingles for a barn roof."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Endtroducing..... is the debut studio album of American music producer DJ Shadow, released on November 19, 1996 on the record label Mo' Wax. The album is renowned for being composed almost entirely of sampled content, most of which originated from various vinyl records obtained by DJ Shadow during trips to record shops. Endtroducing..... was produced by Shadow in the span of two years using minimal equipment, most notably the Akai MPC60 sampler. In creating the album's overall atmosphere, he strived to capture the downbeat nature of his previous releases for the Mo' Wax label. The album's content features both moody, slow-paced tracks and upbeat jams reminiscent of DJ Shadow's early hip hop influences. The album was released to positive reception in the United Kingdom, where DJ Shadow had already established himself as a rising act. It reached the top twenty of the UK Albums Chart and was later certified gold by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI). Mo' Wax issued four singles to promote the album, including the chart hits \"Midnight in a Perfect World\" and \"Stem\". However, it would take considerably longer for Endtroducing..... to find success in the United States. Upon completing promotion of the album and returning to his hometown of Davis, California, DJ Shadow devoted his time to creating new music. Endtroducing..... later peaked at number 37 on the American Billboard Top Heatseekers albums chart. Endtroducing..... received universal acclaim from critics, who praised DJ Shadow's approach to sampling and the beats he created from samples. It ranked highly on various year-end lists of the best albums of 1996. The album is considered to be a landmark work in the instrumental hip hop movement, with DJ Shadow's innovative sampling techniques and arrangements influencing other producers to create similar sample-based works.

	dbo:abstract	"Five Guys Walk into a Bar... is a four-disc retrospective of the British rock group Faces released in 2004, collecting sixty-seven tracks from among the group's four studio albums, assorted single A- and B-sides, BBC sessions, rehearsal tapes and one track from a promotional flexi-disc, \"Dishevelment Blues,\" which was never actually intended for release. Eight of ten tracks from 1973's Ooh La La appear, as do eight of nine from 1971's A Nod Is as Good as a Wink...To a Blind Horse, five of nine from 1971's Long Player (with an additional two in alternate versions) and three of ten from 1970's First Step (Small Faces) (with one extra track appearing in a- and/or B-side that had never appeared before on compact disc appeared on the set, such as the single version of their take on Paul McCartney's \"Maybe I'm Amazed\" and the dobro-driven B-side \"Skewiff (Mend the Fuse).\") The song that opens this set, \"Flying\", is a subtly remixed version from what originally appeared on First Step. \"Wyndlesham Bay\" is one of Stewart's solo songs, \"Jodie\", but with different lyrics. Many tracks from BBC sessions appear throughout, including takes on Rod Stewart's own \"Maggie May\" and \"Gasoline Alley,\" the latter as part of a medley including Faces' own \"Around the Plynth.\" From rehearsal tapes come Faces' earliest recordings from the summer of 1969, including covers of Big Bill Broonzy's \"I Feel So Good\" (featuring Stewart on guitar and Wood on harmonica) and Howlin' Wolf's \"Evil.\" The set was compiled by the group's keyboardist, Ian McLagan, who had previously compiled 1999's Good Boys... When They're Asleep. Five Guys Walk into a Bar... has received a largely positive response from critics since its release. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic praised the box set as the best of its type: \"There has never been a better box set than the Faces' Five Guys Walk into a Bar.... There has never been a box that captures an artist so perfectly, nor has a box set taken greater advantage of unreleased and rare material, to the point where it seems as essential and vital as the released recordings.\""@en ;

The album is the follow-up to the album Tight. The original album name, according to the few promo discs released, is Frankenstein Girls That Seem Strangely Sexy. It is the last studio album to feature Vanessa YT as their bass player, and the last album by them to feature a message from their answering machine (\"M\", in which the caller accuses them of homosexuality) as one of the tracks. The track listing on the back cover has all the vowels replaced with asterisks, even in those words that would not generally be considered offensive. The tracks of this album are also in alphabetical order. The cover of the album was drawn by Jamie Hewlett, the artist known for Tank Girl, and more recently, Gorillaz. Hewlett offered to make a music video for a song on the album but was rejected by Elektra.

	dbo:abstract	"Humanistic is the debut album by Abandoned Pools. It was released in September 2001. Though two songs were co-written by Pete Pagonis, the album is considered a solo work of Tommy Walter's in which he used new material, as well as several songs he'd worked on beforehand in both Tely and Metromax, to compose, record, and release on Extasy Records. The album features a contrast of dark, gloomy, and sometimes aggressive songs such as \"The Remedy\" and \"Blood\" and more serene, upbeat tracks like \"Start Over\" and \"Sunny Day.\" Elements of industrial rock are evident in various ways; keyboard is used in light melody of the ironically dark-lyric-themed \"Ruin Your Life\" as well as the raging chorus of \"Fluorescein,\" and ambiguous, non-sung vocal recordings are featured in various tracks. Synth effects are also utilized in various songs. Four tracks include backing vocals by Angie Hart of Frente!.

	dbo:abstract	"marillion.com is the eleventh studio album by British rock band Marillion, released in 1999. It was the last of three albums in three consecutive years that Marillion released on a contract with Castle Communications between being dropped by EMI Records in 1995 and eventually going independent in the 2000s.It was the first Marillion studio album to fail to reach UK Top 40, peaking at No. 53 and staying on the chart for one week. It was also the first Marillion album from which no singles were released officially. However, \"Deserve\" was released as a promo single, and \"Rich\" served as a radio single in Brazil. There was also a video made for the track \"Deserve\", featuring tour and backstage footage.[citation needed] marillion.com was self-produced with additional production from Porcupine Tree's Steven Wilson on five out of nine tracks. The last track, \"House\", features a dance (trip hop) influence and had the working title \"the Massive Attack song\". The band would go on to explore this territory on their next album Anoraknophobia. Among fans, the album was received more favourably than its predecessor, but it still belongs to their least popular work; in particular, the track \"Built-in Bastard Radar\" is considered to be one of their worst ever by many fans. The album's title is a reference to Marillion's then-new approach in using the internet to communicate with their fans, and in particular to ensure the financing of projects, which would later become known as \"crowdfunding\". In 1997, fans had funded a US tour which Castle Communications had refused to support, and the next album, Anoraknophobia would be completely financed by pre-orders, making the band independent from record company support, except for distribution. The line \"thank God for the internet\" from the track \"Interior Lulu\" (although used ironically in the original context) can also be read as a reference to the band's internet activities, and was in fact used as a slogan later. While preparing the album, the band's management invited fans to send them passport photographs and 732 of these were then used to make up the artwork for the booklet. The songs \"Tumble Down the Years\" and \"Interior Lulu\" were recorded and mixed during the recording sessions for Radiation (1998). It was decided not to include the tracks on that album as the band thought they were incomplete. Marillion made a companion disc to marillion.com, which was named marillion.co.uk and was available for free to everyone who bought the album. The companion disc had a collection of tracks from various live and demo releases, as well as a short interview video (which was originally from a press kit for the album). For several years, marillion.co.uk was regularly updated with newer songs. As a physical item, it is now out of print, but the most recent version from 2005 remains available to download from Marillion's website."@en ;

It is a documentary double album featuring interviews, press conferences, and song snippets with voice-overs, and was issued in response to interviews of the Beatles collected on the Vee-Jay Records release, Hear the Beatles Tell All.[citation needed] Originally, Capitol Records intended to release the group's 1964 performance at the Hollywood Bowl, but due to a lack of advanced studio technology and the excessive amount of loud screaming fans on tape the album was shelved. Another plan was to release a 2 LP 'Greatest Hits' album for the Christmas market. Four songs were to make their Capitol debut on this album: \"A Hard Day's Night,\" \"Misery,\" \"There's a Place,\" and \"From Me to You.\" The album was compiled, but never issued.The Beatles' Story entered the Billboard Pop Albums on 12 December at number 97, and on 2 January 1965 it reached its peak position at number seven, where it remained for four weeks before beginning its slide down the charts. It has been certified a gold record by the RIAA; it was also released in Canada and is currently out of print. It was released by Toshiba EMI in Japan on the Apple label (in stereo) in a box set with a deluxe 24 page 12\"x12\" booklet that contains the entire text of the script in English and Japanese. The album contains a brief stereo excerpt of their 1964 Hollywood Bowl concert, which was unreleased until May 1977 on The Beatles at the Hollywood Bowl. The album was only released on cassette in Canada (4XBB 2222) and Japan (ZR44-1019). The Beatles' Story was being prepared for release on digital audio tape in 1996, but when the format failed commercially the plan was scrapped.[citation needed] In 2014, The Beatles Story was made available on CD for the first time in the Beatles boxed set, The U.S. Albums."@en ;

dbr:The_Velvet_Rope	rdf:type	schema:MusicAlbum ;
	dbo:abstract	"The Velvet Rope is the sixth studio album by American singer Janet Jackson. The album was released on October 7, 1997 through Virgin Records America. Following the release of her first greatest hits compilation Design of a Decade: 1986\u20131996 (1995), Jackson's recording contract with Virgin was up for renewal, making her the subject of a high-profile bidding war among parties including Sony Music, The Walt Disney Company, and Time Warner. She ultimately chose to renew her contract with Virgin for an unprecedented $80 million, making her the world's highest paid musical act for the second time in her career. She unveiled a new image, flaunting vibrant red hair, multiple tattoos, and acquiring facial and body piercings. She also abandoned her surname, releasing material solely under her first name. Upon experiencing an emotional breakdown, Jackson began facing a long-term case of depression, steaming from childhood and adolescent traumas, including body dysmorphia, anorexia and self-harm. She in turn developed her new record as a concept album, using introspection as its theme. Its title is a metaphor for emotional boundaries, as well as an allusion to an individual's need to feel special. Its lyrics address subject matter such as depression, self-worth, social networking, homophobia and domestic violence. It also encompasses themes of sexuality, including BDSM, masturbation, sexual orientation and same-sex relationships. Due to its sexually explicit content, the album reinforced Jackson's public image as a sex symbol and as one of the most erotic vocalists of the 1990s. Its incorporation of social issues regarding sexual orientation also established her reputation as a gay icon and received a GLAAD Media Award for Outstanding Music. The record was co-written and co-produced by Jackson, her then-husband Ren\u00E9 Elizondo, Jr., Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis, with additional contributions by various songwriters. Songs on the album also include British violinist Vanessa-Mae, Canadian singer-songwriter Joni Mitchell and American rapper Q-Tip as featured artists. Its composition fuses various genres, including pop, R&B, trip hop, folk, jazz, rock and electronic music. Considered to be Jackson's most mature recording, it is regarded as a template for pop artists transitioning to a darker or rebellious sound and as a precursor to the development of alternative R&B. Referred to as her magnum opus, The Velvet Rope has been subject to critical acclaim and is included in Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time. The album peaked within the top five positions of the majority of the global record charts it entered. In the United States, it became Jackson's fourth consecutive album to top the Billboard 200. Certified triple platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), it has sold over three million copies in the US according to Nielsen SoundScan and an estimated ten million copies worldwide. Of the six singles released from the project, \"Got 'til It's Gone\" won the 1998 Grammy Award for Best Music Video, \"Together Again\" became one of the best-selling singles worldwide and \"I Get Lonely\" became Jackson's 18th consecutive top ten hit, making her the only female artist in the history of the US Billboard Hot 100 singles chart to achieve that feat. The Velvet Rope Tour in support of the album drew critical acclaim for its theatricality, as well as controversy for its depictions of domestic violence and bondage."@en ;

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/True_Colours_(Split_Enz_album)>	rdf:type	schema:MusicAlbum ;
	dbo:abstract	"True Colours, the fifth album released by New Zealand band Split Enz, was their first major commercial success. Released in 1980, the album featured more mature songwriting from Neil Finn. Credited to him is the album's New Zealand and Australian #1 single, \"I Got You,\" which also broke them internationally. The US release of the album featured \"Shark Attack\" and \"I Got You\" in reversed positions due to the latter's success on the single charts. Originally, the band thought \"Missing Person\" to be the album's standout track, not realizing \"I Got You\" would become the hit. \"I Hope I Never\" was mixed differently for the Australian single release, with strengthened percussion. \"Nobody Takes Me Seriously,\" \"What's the Matter With You\" and \"Poor Boy\" were released as singles in the northern hemisphere. The album was initially released in four colour combinations \u2013 yellow and blue, red and green, purple and yellow, and blue and orange \u2013 but would ultimately be given another four makeovers with releases in lime green and pink, hot purple and burnt orange, gold and platinum (to mark its sales milestones), and finally yellow, blue and red. When it was later released on the A&M label, wild, imaginative shapes and patterns covered the vinyl using a technique known as \"laser-etching\". When light hit the record, these designs would protrude and spin about the room. The album was the first to ever use this technique, originally designed to discourage the creation of counterfeit copies. A synthesizer melody played in \"I Wouldn't Dream of It\" was first introduced in an early Split Enz recording, aptly titled \"The Instrumental\". True Colours was remastered by Eddie Rayner and re-released on two occasions. Firstly in 2003, and yet again with the rest of the Split Enz catalogue on 20 May 2006 with the bonus tracks: Things and Two Of a Kind. In October 2010, the album was listed at number 22 in the book, 100 Best Australian Albums, despite being a New Zealand production."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Fantastic Planet is the third studio album by the American alternative rock band Failure, released on August 13, 1996. It was the last album released on Slash Records as distributed by Warner Bros. Records. The album failed to chart on Billboard 's Top 200 albums, but did produce a charting single with \"Stuck on You\", which reached #23 on Billboard 's Alternative Songs Chart. The album was produced by Failure themselves in a process that took longer than their previous two albums, with one song being recorded and produced soon after being written, and repeating this process. Space-rock themes course through the album's lyrics, as well as various indirect references to drug addiction, drug-related experiences, and prostitution. Seven of the album's songs were also included on Failure's Essentials, a best-of collection from 2006. In 2009, JustPressPlay named Fantastic Planet the third-best album of the 1990s. They also ranked the song \"The Nurse Who Loved Me\" at #10 in its list of the Top 100 Songs of the 1990s. On March 24th 2015 it was announced the album was to be reissued on 180g clear and 120g black vinyl via the band's own PledgeMusic page."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Feeling Strangely Fine is the second studio album by American alternative rock band Semisonic. It is the follow up to the band's debut album Great Divide recorded at Seedy Underbelly Studio, Minneapolis, Minnesota. The band had over 60 new songs in mind as they went into the recording process and had three specific requirements when they decided they wanted to record a new album. First, they didn't want to record any demotapes beyond simple guitar and vocal basement sketches meaning the album versions would be the first band recordings of the songs. Second, they wanted no deadline for the finished masters. Third, the trio wanted to create tracks for the album in various hi- and lo-tech settings around Minneapolis, and use their computers to meld the different sounds together. Nick Launay was brought in to produce the album and the band recorded twenty songs over the course of four months. They pared those down to sixteen, mixed them, and used the best twelve for the finished record."@en ;

dbr:Love_Symbol_Album	rdf:type	schema:MusicAlbum ;
	dbo:abstract	"is the fourteenth studio album by American recording artist Prince, and second (and final to-date) to feature his backing band The New Power Generation. It was released on October 13, 1992 by Paisley Park Records and Warner Bros. Records. Due to its official title being an unpronounceable symbol, which Prince later adopted as his name, the album has been referred to as the Love Symbol Album, Symbol Album, or simply Symbol. It is Prince's second album to feature his backing group, The New Power Generation, which received co-billing for the release. The album contains elements of musical styles including funk, R&B, hip hop, jazz, reggae, and synthpop. It has sold over five million copies worldwide. The album's first two singles, \"My Name Is Prince\" and \"Sexy MF\", achieved modest success on the US pop charts, though both made the top ten in the UK. Conversely, the third single, \"7\", was not as successful as the first two singles in the UK, but was a top ten hit in the US. The album was originally conceived as a \"fantasy rock soap opera\" with various spoken segues throughout. However, in a last-minute attempt to add an additional song (\"I Wanna Melt with U\", which was originally considered to be a B-side to the \"7\" maxi-single, and which contains several sampled sounds also present in \"7\"), most of the segues had to be cut for album length. The few that remained were somewhat confusing in context. The album debuts Mayte Garcia, who plays a part in the album's storyline and would become Prince's wife in 1996. Early pressings of the album featured an embossed gold love symbol on the jewel case, while later editions feature it printed on the booklet or not present on either. 3 Chains o' Gold, a direct-to-video film produced and directed by Prince, was released in 1994. The film is based on the plotline and songs of the Love Symbol Album and contained some of the original segues which were planned to be on the album."@en ;

Also included is the 17-minute epic \"Grendel\", originally a B-side on the 12\" version of the 1982 A-side \"Market Square Heroes\" single.

The Jackson 5's lead singer, a preteenage boy named Michael (who later became a universally-recognized pop star on his own and \"The King of Pop\"), and his older brothers Jackie, Jermaine, Tito, and Marlon, became pop successes within months of this album's release. Diana Ross Presents the Jackson 5's only single, \"I Want You Back\", became a number-one hit on the Billboard Hot 100 within weeks of the album's release and eventually sold five million copies worldwide. The album reached #5 on the Pop Albums chart, and spent nine weeks at #1 on the R&B/Black Albums chart. The album title suggested that Motown star Diana Ross had discovered the group, as do the Ross-penned liner notes on the back cover. Ross' supposed discovery of the Jackson 5 was in fact part of Motown's marketing and promotions plan for the Jackson 5; Motown artists Bobby Taylor and Gladys Knight also claimed to have discovered the Jacksons. Ross did, however, introduce the Jackson 5 to the public both in concert and on television. Actually, Motown signed \"The Jackson Five\" in March 1969 after their discovery and first contract with an owner and producer of Steeltown Records in Gary, Indiana in November 1967."@en ;

dbr:Flush_the_Fashion	rdf:type	schema:MusicAlbum ;
	dbo:abstract	"Flush the Fashion is the twelfth studio album by Alice Cooper, released in 1980, and produced by Roy Thomas Baker. Musically, the album was a drastic change of style for Cooper, leaning towards a new wave influence. Though the lead single \"Clones (We're All)\" only touched the Billboard Top 40, the album was Cooper's most successful album in three years and is widely considered by fans as a hidden gem in his musical catalogue. The album\u2019s ten tracks touch on themes such as the loss of identity, taking on other roles, and the usual Alice Cooper-esque dementia. This is evident even in the lyrics of Flush the Fashion\u2019s cover songs (for example the \u201CClones\u201D single). Cooper also performs several \u201Cstory\u201D songs, presenting a series of intriguing vignettes in lieu of more traditional subject matter. By the time of Flush the Fashion, after a much-publicized stint in a sanitarium in 1977 for alcoholism and subsequent sobriety, Cooper had secretly developed a heavy addiction to cocaine, although, unlike his following three albums Cooper has some recollection \u2013 if not perfect \u2013 of making Flush the Fashion. Cooper did tour the album through the United States and Mexico City during 1980, playing \u201CClones\u201D, \u201CPain\u201D, \u201CModel Citizen\u201D, \u201CGrim Facts\u201D, \u201CTalk Talk\u201D, \u201CDance Yourself to Death\u201D and \u201CNuclear Infected\u201D on a regular basis. The first four songs remained part of the setlist for the Special Forces tour a year later. Apart from \u201CClones\u201D, of which there were a few irregular performances between 1996 and 2003 and which was a regular part of Cooper\u2019s setlist during the 2011-2012 \u2018No More Mr. Nice Guy\u2019 tour, nothing from Flush the Fashion has been performed live since 1982."@en ;

The album features \"Nationwide\" and \"The Vaginals,\" two tracks which received airplay (primarily on college radio stations). \"The Vaginals\" was retitled \"Ugly on the Inside\" (after the song's chorus) due to the label's choice to promote it as the album's single. Later pressings of the album (as well as the music video) bear the latter title for track #3. A working title for this album was Everything's Coming Up Toilets. The final title was chosen when the band found decaying human remains in the woods near the recording studio and later read \"Mutilation Makes Identification Difficult\" as a headline in the local newspaper."@en ;

Drawing on funk, rock, and electronic production techniques, it was scorned by established jazz critics at the time of its release and was one of Davis's worst-selling recordings. Its critical standing has improved dramatically with the passage of time; In 2014, Stereogum ranked it as Davis's best album, while in 2007 BBC Music noted its influence and foreshadowing of a variety of subsequent musical genres. Joining previous multi-disc Davis reissues, On the Corner was reissued as part of the 6-disc box set The Complete On the Corner Sessions in 2007."@en ;

It is his eleventh overall studio album. The album was partly created so he could be free from his contract with Sony Music and FDM. Therefore it is not so commercially minded. The style is ambient, lounge, chill-out and jazz and the recordings are made from jam sessions along with Francis Rimbert. After 2000's M\u00E9tamorphoses, Jarre somewhat returned to his usual formula with this album, with it consisting of six mostly long, instrumental tracks (like Oxyg\u00E8ne), although this time there are short breaks between the tracks, and the track titles are different dates spread over a year (presumably the year 2000, given the album's title), instead of the tracks being indicated as \"parts\". Some synthesizer workstations, most notably the Korg Triton and the Roland XP-80, were heavily used. Some of the sounds in this album were used earlier on Interior Music released in 2001. The CD does not come with an actual booklet. The album cover is just printed on cardboard, with the track listing and credits on the back side."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik is the debut album of American hip hop duo OutKast, released on April 26, 1994, by LaFace Records. After befriending each other in 1992, rappers Andr\u00E9 3000 and Big Boi pursued recording music as a duo and worked with production team Organized Noize, which led to their signing to LaFace. The album was produced by the team and recorded at the Dungeon, D.A.R.P. Studios, Purple Dragon, Bosstown, and Doppler Studios in Atlanta. A Southern hip hop album, Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik features live instrumentation in its hip hop production and musical elements from funk and soul genres. Wanting to make a statement about urban life as an African American in the South, OutKast wrote and recorded the album as teenagers and addressed coming of age topics with the album's songs. They also incorporated repetitive hooks and Southern slang in their lyrics. The album peaked at number 20 on the Billboard 200, on which it charted for 26 weeks, and was eventually certified platinum in the United States. It was promoted with three singles, including \"Player's Ball\", which helped create buzz for the album. Upon its release, Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik received positive reviews from music critics and helped distinguish Southern hip hop as a credible hip hop scene, amid East Coast and West Coast hip hop's market dominance. The album has since been viewed by writers as an important release in both hip hop and Atlanta's music scene."@en ;

It featured a more straight-rock sound and displayed an almost complete absence of the keyboards and sampling that marked the early sound of the band. Due to many delays in the release of the album, which consisted of the label shelving the album for two years after recording was already completed in 2003 and Jason Perry experiencing illness, the band already were out of general public interest due to the long time they were away from releasing material. This meant the album was given very little promotional attention by the label and media, meaning it only charted at #95 in the UK charts and were dropped by Warners in October as a result.[citation needed] After the failure of the album, the band went on hiatus until reforming in 2009. \"Rush Song\" was played as background music in the UK version of the television show Pimp My Ride.[citation needed]"@en ;

It has a big, open feel certain to appeal to any classic rock fan, but retains the warm intimacy of previous albums.\" The naming of the album and comments by Jason Molina have led to discussions whether it is not, in fact, the first album by Molina's new band, also named Magnolia Electric Co. In fact the artwork for the album does not contain the name Songs: Ohia anywhere. On the other hand, the album was recorded with different musicians than the current members of Magnolia Electric Co., and the decision to take on the new name was not announced until the tour following the release in the spring of 2003.

	dbo:abstract	"A Song for \u00D7\u00D7 (the \"\u00D7\u00D7\" is silent) is the major-label debut album and second album overall by Japanese pop artist Ayumi Hamasaki, released January 1, 1999 by Avex Trax. Primarily a rock-pop album, it features musical composition and arrangements by Yasuhiko Hoshino, Mitsuru Igarashi, and others. Hamasaki acted as the album's sole lyricist, a notable feat for a pop artist her age at the time. \"Poker Face\" was released as the album's lead single on April 8, 1998. Entering the Oricon chart at number twenty, it became her first charting single. Four further singles were released to promote A Song for \u00D7\u00D7: \"You\", \"Trust\", \"For My Dear...\", and Depend on You\". All of them were top twenty hits in Japan, with the latter three reaching the top ten. The album debuted atop the Oricon Charts with first week sales of 548,210 copies; it topped the chart for five weeks, a remarkable feat for a debut album. Its high first week sales were partly due to its debut sales being the first and second week sales combined (Oricon only has 51 weeks instead of 52). The album charted for 63 weeks and was certified Million by the Recording Industry Association of Japan for shipments exceeding one million copies in the country. As of 2008, A Song for \u00D7\u00D7 is Japan's 139th best selling album of all time."@en ;

The album was released in 1977 in two different versions, comprising a total of 30 songs by The Beatles. The performances were recorded on a home tape machine using a single microphone, resulting in a low fidelity recording. Ted \"Kingsize\" Taylor began to investigate possible marketing of the tapes in 1973. The tapes were eventually bought by Paul Murphy and subjected to extensive audio processing to improve the sound, leading to the 1977 album. Although the poor sound quality limits its commercial appeal, the album provides historic insight into the group's club act in the period after Ringo Starr joined but before the emergence of Beatlemania. The Beatles were unsuccessful in legally blocking the initial release of the album; the recordings were reissued in many forms until 1998, when The Beatles were awarded full rights to the performances."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Long Gone Before Daylight is the fifth studio album by The Cardigans. After a long hiatus from their last album in 1998 (with members of the band experimenting with other projects) it was finally released in Japan on 19 March 2003 and in Europe on 24 March 2003. Later it was also released in Canada (22 April 2003) and North America (25 May 2004). The album differs from the band's earlier works. Their familiar \"happy\" pop sound takes on a change to pop songs with more of an American country music influence. It is relatively a much darker album than their previous works, and more quiet than the noisier Gran Turismo. Even lead singer Nina Persson dyed her once light blonde hair to jet black, reflecting the band's change of mood. Criticism was generally mixed to positive. Some found the change of direction welcome, and felt the band had matured, making songs that were even better than other experienced country-pop styled artists. Others missed the old pop sound, and accused the band of possibly being ashamed of their former \"happy\" pop sound. The first single of the album, \"For What It's Worth\", was released on 17 February 2003. The second single \"You're the Storm\" was released on 2 June 2003. The third and final single \"Live and Learn\" was released on 3 December 2003. \"Communication\" was later covered as \"\u8A5E\u4E0D\u9054\u610F\" by Hong Kong Cantopop singer Sandy Lam in her 2006 album Breathe Me."@en ;

The group recorded an album in New York, which was never released. This led to the termination of the group's recording contract. After returning to Portsmouth, Virginia, Elliott and record producer Timbaland began writing songs, contributing several to singer Aaliyah's album, One in a Million (1996). In 1996, Elliott was signed to Elektra Records and was given her own record label, Goldmind. Chairmen and chief executive officer (CEO) of Elektra at the time, Sylvia Rhone encouraged Elliott to embark in a solo career. Supa Dupa Fly was recorded and produced solely by Timbaland in October 1996, and was released in July 1997 through The Goldmind Inc. and Elektra Records.

Prior to the successful release of his debut album, Doggystyle (1993), Snoop was charged with murder. During 1995, Snoop had been spending much time preparing for the case, which went to trial later that year. In February 1996, he was cleared of all charges and began working on his second album, without Dr. Dre as producer. This was Snoop's last album on Death Row Records under the name of Snoop Doggy Dogg. The album debuted at number one during the week of November 12, 1996 selling 478,971 copies, but it failed to match the commercial success of Doggystyle and 2Pac's album The Don Killuminati: The 7 Day Theory (1996). 2Pac had become a friend of Snoop during 1996 and died weeks before the release of Tha Doggfather. Dr. Dre had left Death Row to his partner Suge Knight, who was indicted on racketeering charges by the end of 1996. Consequently, Snoop's second album stalled at sales of two million. It was released only one week after another Death Row release, the first posthumous album by slain Makaveli, The Don Killuminati: The 7 Day Theory, which also debuted at number one.

	dbo:abstract	"Welcome to the Neighbourhood is Meat Loaf's seventh studio album, released in 1995 as follow-up to the popular album Bat Out of Hell II: Back into Hell. It went platinum in the United States and United Kingdom. The album is thought of as a concept album, as all of the songs are ordered in the track listing as to tell a story about a relationship throughout the years. Three singles were released: \"I'd Lie for You (And That's the Truth)\" (a duet with Patti Russo), \"Not a Dry Eye in the House\" and \"Runnin' for the Red Light (I Gotta Life)\". The first two reached #2 and #7 in the UK charts, while the latter reached #21. In some markets, radio stations were also playing \"Amnesty Is Granted\", even though it was not released as an official single. Despite the chart success of the album and its singles, only \"Amnesty is Granted\" has appeared on an official live album, Casa De Carne (Live 2008) as a bonus CD with Hang Cool Teddy Bear. \"I'd Lie for You (And That's the Truth)\" was recorded as a sound check with the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra, but only included as a bonus download track. Of the twelve songs on the album, two are written by Jim Steinman. Both are covers, the \"Original Sin\" from Pandora's Box's Original Sin album (it was also heard in the movie The Shadow, where it was performed by Taylor Dayne) and \"Left in the Dark\" first appeared on Steinman's own album Bad for Good. The first two singles are written by Diane Warren, who later also wrote songs for Meat Loaf's albums Couldn't Have Said It Better and Bat Out of Hell III: The Monster Is Loose."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Crooked Rain, Crooked Rain: LA's Desert Origins is a double album by Pavement released on October 26, 2004. It contains the band's second album, Crooked Rain, Crooked Rain (1994) in its entirety, as well as 37 of the band's other songs from that era, 25 of which (the entire second disc) were previously unreleased. The album also contains a 62-page booklet of liner notes, which contain photographs, artwork, accounts from vocalist/guitarist Stephen Malkmus and guitarist Scott Kannberg (aka \"Spiral Stairs\"), and notes Malkmus wrote for Melody Maker about each of the songs on the original album. The liner notes also feature a surreal and sensationalistic \"interview\" between Matador's Gerard Cosloy and the fictitious \"Rob Jurkface\". According to Cosloy, he took questions by Pavement's biographer, Rob Jovanovic, changed them slightly, and wrote silly answers for them. Some of the songs on the second disc (\"Flux = Rad,\" \"Kennel District\", \"Grounded\" and \"Pueblo\") are early forms of songs on 1995's Wowee Zowee. Shortly after the release of this set, a Matador employee posted corrected info regarding the recording sessions for the previously unreleased tracks on disc two: Only tracks 2 through 8 feature Gary Young on drums. Tracks 13 through 21 were recorded at Gary Young's studio in Stockton, though Gary does not play on them; any drums were played by Spiral Stairs. A further mistake is found in the track-listing on the back of the CD; Silence Kid is listed as Silence Kit, despite the interior artwork showing the correct name in print several times, including written in Stephen Malkmus's own handwriting. Some have pointed out that on Pavement's 2010 tour the song appeared on their set-list as \"Silence Kit\" (Set list), although it is not clear who typed the list, or if it was done as a joke."@en ;

The album, along with the single of the same name, established the band as an internationally successful rock act and was also influential in originating the musical style known as folk rock. The album immediately changed the face of rock music, also along with the bands next four LP's, even had a great influence on 1980s and 1990s Alternative rock bands R.E.M., The Long Ryders, Toad The Wet Sprocket & Gin Blossoms, to name a few. The term \"folk rock\" was, in fact, first coined by the U.S. music press to describe the band's sound in mid-1965, at around the same time that the \"Mr. Tambourine Man\" single reached the top of the Billboard chart. The single and album also represented the first effective American challenge to the dominance of The Beatles and the British Invasion during the mid-1960s. The album peaked at No.6 on the Billboard Top LPs chart and reached No.7 in the United Kingdom. The Bob Dylan penned \"Mr. Tambourine Man\" single was released ahead of the album in April 1965, reaching No.1 on both the Billboard Hot 100 and the UK Singles Chart. A second single from the album, \"All I Really Want to Do\", also a Dylan cover, was moderately successful in the U.S. but fared better in the United Kingdom, where it reached the Top 10."@en ;

This album was out of print, but it has been reissued by Relapse Records as of November 2012. The only album to feature both guitarist James Murphy and bassist Terry Butler and the last to feature drummer Bill Andrews.This is the first of Death's albums to show Schuldiner's lyrics moving away from the gore and horror themes of previous works, focusing instead on themes of society including abortion, genetics, and televangelism, a direction that would be further refined on 1991's Human album. The musical content is more obviously melodic, a facet highlighted by James Murphy's characteristic lead guitar playing. The members of Death and their manager/co-producer Eric Greif stayed in a single motel room at the Safari Inn, near Busch Gardens, for the entire six weeks the album was recorded and mixed, although bassist Terry Butler and drummer Bill Andrews frequently went home as they lived in the Tampa area. This was the final Death album cover painted by Ed Repka. This period was one of massive controversy for Death, as Butler and Andrews toured Europe without Schuldiner (who refused to do the tour on the basis that it had been badly organised), with vocalist Louis Carrisalez in his place. Butler and Andrews were dismissed from the band following this incident. Greif played a Kawai K1 keyboard part in the middle of title track \"Spiritual Healing\"."@en ;

The notes also include a discography and a one-page comic by Mary Fleener, a visual interpretation of the song \"I Got You (I Feel Good).\" In 2003, the album was ranked number 75 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time.

	dbo:abstract	"The Notorious Byrd Brothers is the fifth album by the American rock band The Byrds and was released in January 1968 on Columbia Records (see 1968 in music). Musically, the album represents the pinnacle of The Byrds' psychedelic experimentation, with the band blending together elements of folk rock, psychedelic rock, country music, electronic music, baroque pop and jazz on many of the songs. Of these disparate styles, the subtle country and western influences evident on a number of tracks pointed towards the full-blown country rock direction that the band would pursue on their next album. In addition, The Notorious Byrd Brothers saw the band and record producer Gary Usher making extensive use of a number of studio effects and production techniques, including phasing, flanging, and spatial panning. The Byrds also introduced the sound of the pedal steel guitar and the Moog modular synthesizer into their music for the first time on the album, making it one of the first LP releases on which the Moog appears. Recording sessions for the album took place throughout the latter half of 1967 and were fraught with tension, resulting in the loss of two members of the band. Rhythm guitarist David Crosby was fired in October 1967 and drummer Michael Clarke left the band midway through recording, returning briefly before finally being dismissed after completion of the album. Additionally, original band member Gene Clark, who had left the group in early 1966, rejoined for three weeks during the making of the album, before leaving again. Author Ric Menck has noted that in spite of these changes in personnel and the conflict surrounding its creation, The Notorious Byrd Brothers is the band's most cohesive and ethereal-sounding album statement. Upon its release, the album reached number 47 on the Billboard Top LPs chart and number 12 on the UK Album Chart. A cover of the Gerry Goffin and Carole King song \"Goin' Back\" was released in October 1967 as the lead single from the album to mild chart success. Although The Notorious Byrd Brothers was critically praised at the time of its release, it was only moderately successful commercially, particularly in the United States. However, the album is today widely considered to be one of The Byrds' best LP releases, as well as their most experimental and progressive."@en ;

It spent sixty-six weeks on the Billboard album chart, and peaked at #26.

Produced with Kristoffer Rygg, together with Knut Magne Valle and Tore Ylwizaker, it was issued on December 17, 1998 via Jester Records. It is a musical setting of William Blake's poem The Marriage of Heaven and Hell. The album blended electronics, industrial music elements, progressive metal and avant-garde rock, adding ambient passages, following Blake's plates as track indexes. Stine Gryt\u00F8yr, Ihsahn, Samoth and Fenriz all feature as guest vocalists. The album received widespread acclaim from critics within both the rock/metal and alternative music press - being awarded Album of the Month in several high-profile magazines such as Terrorizer, Metal Hammer, and Rock Hard and ranked very highly in their end of year's best polls. However, the album\u2019s transitional nature perhaps alienated many fans of the band\u2019s first three albums - causing a backlash from the black metal scene. Controversial director of films Kids and Gummo, Harmony Korine, recently commented, alluding to The Marriage of Heaven and Hell: \"There's a real lineage from a composer like Wagner to a band like Ulver.\""@en ;

dbr:Live_at_the_Ambassadors	rdf:type	schema:MusicAlbum ;
	dbo:abstract	"Eddie Izzard made his West End debut in 1993 at the Ambassadors Theatre. The show originally had a 4-week run, which was extended twice due to the popularity of the performance. Later released on video, titled \"Live at the Ambassadors\", the show led to Izzard being invited to the Just For Laughs Montreal Comedy Festival, awarded a British Comedy Award for \"Top Stand Up Comedian\", and receiving an Olivier Award nomination for \"Outstanding Achievement\". Live at the Ambassadors was Izzard's first video, which for many years was out of production and very difficult to come by. However, it is available on CD from the official Eddie Izzard website, where it is pointed out that this performance will \"never be released on DVD\". However, it is available on VHS. Izzard despised his look on the show, and was also on low performance rights with the copyright owner, and this DVD will never be released.Fans and critics alike recognise the change in Izzard's comedy over the years; Live at the Ambassadors is an example of Izzard's very early and less refined style of stand up. His bizarre sense of humour has remained the same throughout performances, and various themes and ideas that can be seen in later recordings can be identified in Live at the Ambassadors such as Christian hymns (and religion in general), politics, cult television and wordplay/oddities within the English language. There is also very little evidence of his cross dressing, something that would become a major part of the Izzard 'brand' later in his career."@en ;

It was released on CD in 1998, compiling tracks that were originally released on two separate vinyl records and included in the mail order Old Masters box sets, which were released in three volumes between 1985 and 1987. (These box sets, issued on Barking Pumpkin, contained repressings of Zappa's albums from Freak Out! (1966) to Zoot Allures (1976), along with a 'Mystery Disc' in boxes one and two.) The CD omits the last two tracks from the 1985 LP, \"Why Don'tcha Do Me Right?\" and \"Big Leg Emma\", both of which were included on the CD version of Absolutely Free (1967) in 1989. The recordings featured on Mystery Disc cover the early stages of Zappa's career, and were made between 1962 and 1969 (with the exception of \"The Story of Willie the Pimp\", a 1972 'field recording'). The material overlaps in places with that of You Can't Do That on Stage Anymore, Vol. 5 (1992), Ahead of Their Time (1993), The Lost Episodes (1996) and Finer Moments (2013). A number of the earlier tracks\u2014\"I Was a Teen-Age Malt Shop\", \"The Birth of Captain Beefheart\" and \"Metal Man Has Won His Wings\", all likely recorded in 1964\u2014feature Captain Beefheart on vocals.

On the album, Portner and Lennox both utilize acoustic guitars and tribal-like drums; the electric guitar, an important element in the Collective's previous album, Here Comes the Indian, is absent. This sound brought the band closer to the psych folk and freak folk genres that critics tended to group them in around this period.[not verified in body] Sung Tongs is generally considered to be Animal Collective's breakthrough release; it generated much praise from critics upon its release and was frequently featured in best-of lists at the end of 2004."@en ;

dbr:Sunshine_Hit_Me	rdf:type	schema:MusicAlbum ;
	dbo:abstract	"Sunshine Hit Me is the debut album from the British band The Bees. At the time when the album was recorded the band only comprised Paul Butler and Aaron Fletcher, who wrote, performed and recorded the album alone using a home studio in Butler's parent's garden. Both Butler and Fletcher had been notables on the Isle of Wight local scene for a while, performing in local indie/electronic outfits Pnu Riff and, more recently, the Exploding Thumbs. Butler had also guested on several other island albums, including some by Max Brennan. The album is very eclectic and summery, with a range of influences, including psychedelia, Jamaican dub, reggae, indie, 1960s rock and others. As a result it is very difficult to describe, and perhaps a somewhat surprising choice for a cult album. However its infectious grooves, and laid-back summer sounds propelled it to the front of the British music scene, even earning it a Mercury Music Prize nomination. The album also featured in the 2005 and 2008 editions of the book 1001 Albums: You Must Hear Before You Die by Michael Lydon. The main single \"A Minha Menina\" was used in a Citro\u00EBn car advertisement, which also helped the band to get noticed. The track was also used in an advert for Magners Irish Cider in December 2008, as well as a Mars advertisement in Australia in 2002. The band followed up the album by several tours, which resulted in the band expanding into the current lineup in order to play the material live. However, all the members had played with Butler before on the island, whether in his other projects or simply in informal jams (whilst Butler and Fletcher produced and performed the album themselves, the entire six-piece is credited on the back sleeve). After the huge success of the album, the band signed to Virgin, who released the follow-up Free The Bees in 2004."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Aaron Carter is the self-titled debut studio album by American pop singer Aaron Carter, brother of Backstreet Boys member Nick Carter. It was originally released in December 1997 in Europe and re-released the next year with a new song and a remix, as well as being released in the United States in the summer of 1998 when Aaron was only ten years old, making him the youngest male pop star in the world since Michael Jackson in 1969. The original version of the album was also available as a limited edition including a poster and a pen that had written on the side, \"I Love Aaron\", available in red, yellow, green or blue. The album reached the top 10 in some European countries, and reached #12 in the United Kingdom. While it did not chart on the U.S. Billboard 200, it did manage to reach #17 on the US Top Heatseekers chart, and sold more than 100,000 in the United States. Three singles were released from the album; \"Crush on You\", a cover of The Jets' 1985 song, \"Crazy Little Party Girl\", and \"I'm Gonna Miss You Forever\". Other songs were released as limited edition singles in some regions. \"Crush on You\" and \"Crazy Little Party Girl\" went top 10 and 20 respectively in Australia, while both went top 10 in the UK. All three singles went top 20 in Germany and Sweden, with \"I'm Gonna Miss You Forever\" peaking at #24 on the UK Singles Chart. \"Surfin' U.S.A.\", a cover of the 1963 song by The Beach Boys, was later included on the re-release edition of the album, and released separately as an EP, and went top 20 in the UK and Germany. When the album was first made available to purchase on iTunes, it strangely featured a Parental Advisory label next to the songs.[citation needed] This was changed to a \"clean\" label at a later date; however, no \"explicit\" version exists, as none of the songs actually feature any profanity or suggestive themes, partly due to Carter's age at the time (he became ten years old six days after the album's release); and intended audience. The album sold more than 1 million copies worldwide."@en ;

During the long hiatus in the middle of the album's production, Anastasio flew to Atlanta to record his 2005 album Shine, which was very pop-oriented and different from Anastasio's normal musical style. Bar 17 contains songs written over roughly three years by Anastasio, from the spring of 2003 to the spring of 2006. The album features contributions by a greatly varied cast of musicians including Phish bandmates Mike Gordon and Jon Fishman as well as the Benevento/Russo Duo and John Medeski. The album credits a total of 42 musicians as performing on various tracks. The first single released from the album is Dragonfly, recorded with Mike Gordon and the Benevento/Russo Duo. Unlike Shine, no video has been recorded. Bar 17 was released on October 3, 2006. Pre-orders made on Anastasio's official webstore came with a bonus disc, 18 Steps.

	dbo:abstract	"Blue Is the Colour is the fifth studio album from English sophisti-pop band The Beautiful South, released in October 1996 through Go! Discs and in America through Ark 21 Records. Following the two singles \"Pretenders to the Throne\" and \"Dream a Little Dream\", which never featured on any album until the release of the second greatest hits Solid Bronze in 2001, it was named after a pub in Sheffield. The album continued the melancholic tone of its predecessor Miaow, and is generally considered to be the band's darkest effort, reflecting Heaton's life at the time. This comes across in songs such as \"Liar's Bar\" (about alcoholism), \"The Sound of North America\" (a sarcastic look at capitalism), \"Mirror\" (Prostitution), \"Blackbird on the Wire\", \"Have Fun\" (which Heaton has cited as his saddest song), and the self-explanatory \"Alone\". The album spawned 4 singles, the first being \"Rotterdam\", which peaked at #5 in the charts in September 1996. The follow ups were \"Don't Marry Her\" which reached #8 in December, \"Blackbird on the Wire\", which got to #23 in March 1997 and finally the single \"Liar's Bar\" which just missed the Top 40 in June. The lyrics to \"Don't Marry Her\" were substantially altered for radio release - changing from \"Don't marry her, fuck me\" to \"Don't marry her, have me\", and with \"sweaty bollocks\" becoming \"Sandra Bullocks\". On \"Liars' Bar\", Paul Heaton's vocal consciously imitates the style of Tom Waits, while in \"Alone\" the bass line serves as another allusion to him. The album itself topped the album charts on 2 November 1996. Some versions of the album come with a sticker saying \"WARNING track one contains some possibly offensive blue language\""@en ;
