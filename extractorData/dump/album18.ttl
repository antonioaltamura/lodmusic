dbr:Strip_Me	dbo:abstract	"Strip Me is the third studio album by British singer-songwriter Natasha Bedingfield. Originally due for release on 9 November 2010, the album's release was pushed back to 7 December 2010 on Phonogenic Records. \"Touch\" was released as the first single from the album on 18 May 2010, while the title track title song was released as the second single on 31 August 2010. Neither of the album's singles were particularly successful on the US Billboard charts, although the album's title song enjoyed some success on the adult contemporary format, where it peaked at number twenty-three. Critical response to the album was generally mixed, with critics praising Strip Me's polished production, but stating that Bedingfield failed to deliver anything different or outstanding. The album debuted at number 103 with 10,000 copies sold, a significant drop compared to her previous album, which debuted at number three, and sold five times as many copies. In Europe, Strip Me was released in May 2011 under the title Strip Me Away, with more colorful artwork and an expanded list of tracks."@en ;

The album contains a cover of two songs - the first of which is \"Mean Sleep\" - a song that Hunt wrote with actress Cree Summer on her lone album Street Fa\u00EBrie. Another song that is a cover is the song \"No Sense of Crime\" - a track that was originally recorded by the former members of The Stooges, Iggy Pop and James Williamson on their 1975 album Kill City.

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Acid_Tiger_(album)>	rdf:type	schema:MusicAlbum ;
	dbo:abstract	"Acid Tiger is the self-titled debut studio album by the American rock band Acid Tiger. The album was released on April 27, 2010 through Deathwish Inc. \u2014 a label that was co-founded by Jacob Bannon of Converge. Acid Tiger is a supergroup composed of Ben Koller (Converge, All Pigs Must Die), Lukas Previn (Thursday, United Nations), Adam Wentworth (Bloodhorse, All Pigs Must Die) and J Rattlesnake. The album has been compared to 90s math rock and the psychedelic rock band The Doors. The album received generally negative or mixed reviews by music critics. Casey Boland of Alternative Press gave the album a half-star-out-of-five and stated: \"The more we listen to Acid Tiger, the more it appears these songs were conceived with tongue firmly in cheek (and bong tightly in hand). Acid Tiger might have been a blast to record, but at times, it's a bust to listen to. It's a shame, since Acid Tiger demonstrate the potential to update and elevate a rock genre mostly ruined by scads of hairspray-loving bands throughout the '80s.\" Brian \"inagreendase\" of Punknews.org gave the album two-out-of-five stars and stated: \"Even with 11 minutes and two tracks of incessant noodling and phasing to go on Acid Tiger's self-titled debut, its listener will have been thoroughly exhausted. Or rocked. But probably just tired and annoyed. There's a great deal of promise Acid Tiger's members bear, but this is just not the fruition of it. Except for maybe Ballou--shit sounds good, at least.\" Keith Carman of Exclaim! gave the album a mixed review and stated that ultimately, \"Acid Tiger have the capability of piquing interest, but sustaining it might be a bit more difficult with the \"Jack of all trades, master of none\" approach they currently adhere to.\" However, Kevin Stewart-Panko of Rock Sound gave the album a positive eight-out-of-ten and stated: \"It would be a shame to dismiss Acid Tiger based on where they lay their heads because they have a healthy pedigree (including Converge's Ben Koller on drums) and infuse their raunchy punk with the white-knuckled rhythms of Grand Funk Railroad and a blazing up-tempo psychedelic sizzle. You can dance, drink, fight and fuck to it, plus it'll put hair on your chest. What more do you need?\""@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"American Tragedy is the second studio album by American rap rock band Hollywood Undead. Production for the album began following the induction of Daniel Murillo into the band in early 2010 and lasted until December. Don Gilmore and Ben Grosse, who helped produce the band's debut album, Swan Songs (2008), also returned to produce the album along with several other producers including Kevin Rudolf, Sam Hollander, Dave Katz, Griffin Boice, Jeff Halavacs, and Jacob Kasher. The album is musically heavier and features darker lyrical content than the band's previous effort. Originally set to release in March, American Tragedy was released on April 5, 2011 in the United States and was released on various other dates that month in other countries. A remix of the album, American Tragedy Redux, was released on November 21, 2011. The album debuted at number four on the US Billboard 200, selling approximately 67,000 copies in its first week in the United States, and ended up becoming the 142nd best selling album of 2011 in the US. It also charted in a few other countries, including Canada and the UK, a first for the band. The album also had five singles: \"Hear Me Now\", \"Been to Hell\", \"Coming Back Down\", \"Comin' in Hot\", and \"My Town\", with music videos being made for all of them except \"Coming Back Down\" as it was released on the same day as \"Been to Hell\". The band participated in three headlining tours: the Revolt Tour, the Endless Summer Tour, and the World War III Tour, as well as other supporting tours throughout 2011 to promote the album. Upon release, American Tragedy received mixed reviews. Critics consistently noted the darker and more serious tone of the album, but to mixed reception. Lyrics were widely criticized while the energy and instruments were praised in most reviews."@en ;

Vinyl records of Butthole Surfers are still available from that label, under the name Brown Reason to Live. The album also contains four bonus tracks (15-18). Two of them, \"Gary Floyd\" and \"Matchstick,\" are live songs from the Live PCPPEP concert. The third bonus track, \"Sinister Crayon,\" was previously only available on the double-LP version of the compilation Humpty Dumpty LSD. \"Something\" is an early demo, which was also released on the compilation The Hole Truth... and Nothing Butt. The CD's label features a reproduction of the \"Pee Pee the Sailor\" cartoon that had appeared on Alternative Tentacles' vinyl printings of Butthole Surfers. It also reprints that record's erroneous suggestion that listeners play the disc at \"69 RPM,\" a joke referencing the famous sex position."@en ;

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cheer_Up!>	rdf:type	schema:MusicAlbum ;
	dbo:abstract	"Cheer Up! is the fourth full length release from ska punk band Reel Big Fish. It is a slight departure from the band's other releases, veering toward more of a rock sound as opposed to ska, especially on the first five tracks, where nary a syncopated drum beat or upstroke on the guitar is heard. Nevertheless, the album is a continuation of the band's longstanding tradition of putting self-loathing lyrics to upbeat music. The hornless single, \"Where Have You Been?\", was a moderate success in 2002, helping album sales. The album also shows Reel Big Fish expanding their musical styles past the pop-rock sound, as it contains an a cappella cover of Frank Sinatra's classic \"New York, New York\" as well as a cover of Sublime's \"Boss DJ\". Additionally, the last track, \"Drunk Again,\" as well as the international bonus track \"Average Man,\" is actually sung by Reel Big Fish trumpeter-guitarist-pianist-vocalist Scott Klopfenstein, with a style differing from the traditional Reel Big Fish sound, and the former song later being performed by Klopfenstein's side project The Littlest Man Band. The band later stated, perhaps jokingly, that the song was accidentally put on the album and was intended to have been on a Littlest Man Band album instead.[citation needed] The CD cover art of the evil clown for this album was drawn by Aaron Barrett's father."@en ;

Lights and Sounds is Yellowcard's first concept album, which was inspired to reflect what the band was feeling at the time of production and how they have matured in the process. Lights and Sounds also departs from the sounds on Yellowcard's previous album, Ocean Avenue (2003), which broke away from its pop punk sound to a more alternative rock album. Lights and Sounds debuted to mixed reviews from contemporary music critics, receiving criticism as the album fell short from the standard set by its predecessor, Ocean Avenue. Upon the album's release, it charted at number five on Billboard's 200 and Top Internet Albums' charts, making it the band highest charting album to date. The album accumulated sales of just over 315,000 copies, which failed to match the 2 million sales of their previous album. Yellowcard went on to explain that the disappointment of the sales were due to their going \"a bit too far\" with the expectations they had thought the album would exceed. Lights and Sounds was certified Gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). The album yielded two singles, \"Lights and Sounds\" and \"Rough Landing, Holly\". While the band was promoting the album, lead guitarist Ben Harper parted ways with the band. Following Harper's departure, the band revealed that they had entered their \"highest and lowest\" points because of Harper's departure from the band. To accommodate the album's promotion, Yellowcard replaced Harper with guitarist Ryan Mendez."@en ;

Two remix bundles of the album (available as a digital download and 12\" vinyl) were released on June 25 and September 10, respectively. Murphy commented on the official site for the EP that she \"does not speak a word of Italian\", admitting that although aided by her partner, Italian producer Sebastiano Properzi, \"the correct pronunciation of the words along with understanding and conveying the meaning was difficult and tedious\". She credited the songs with inspiring her to \"exercise\" her vocals and make them \"bigger\".

Although she grew up in the city, she described black folk music and spirituals as \u201Cliberation songs\" and used this music to \u201Cdo my teaching and preaching, my propagandizing.\u201D Both Odetta and Bob Dylan sang at the 1963 Civil Rights March in Washington DC. When this album was recorded, Bob Dylan only just turning away from the protest singer phase, and had not yet released music done with electric instruments. His songs \"Blowin' in the Wind\" (which Odetta had recorded earlier) and \"The Times They Are a-Changin\u2019\" were still anthems of the civil rights movement, and \"With God on Our Side\" and \"Masters of War\" longer, bitter anti-war songs. Yet Odetta also made sure to include love songs, and other not obviously political tracks written by Bob Dylan, transformed by her powerful voice. In addition to a number of well-known Dylan compositions, a couple of fairly obscure songs were included, including \"Baby, I'm in the Mood for You\". This album was re-released on CD by BMG Camden (773802) in August 3, 2000. \"Blowin' in the Wind\" (which first appeared on Odetta Sings Folk Songs, 1963) and \"Paths of Victory\" (Odetta Sings of Many Things, 1964) were added as bonus tracks."@en ;

dbr:Sometime_Anywhere	rdf:type	schema:MusicAlbum ;
	dbo:abstract	"Sometime Anywhere is the ninth album by the Australian psychedelic rock band The Church, released in May 1994. After the commercially unsuccessful 1992 album Priest=Aura, founding guitarist Peter Koppes had departed, leaving the band down to just two original members, Steve Kilbey and Marty Willson-Piper, plus Priest's drummer Jay Dee Daugherty. With the group's future uncertain, the members took time off to focus on other projects, while Koppes began to establish a solo career with his new group, The Well, which included former band mate Richard Ploog. Kilbey began a Jack Frost collaboration with Grant McLennan (of The Go-Betweens) and Willson-Piper returned to the studio with UK group All About Eve, to record their album Ultraviolet. Arista Records decided to stand by their contract with the band and back another album, despite the loss of Koppes, and so Kilbey and Willson-Piper began writing new material. When it became clear that drummer Daugherty would not be returning to the fold either, the remaining two took the opportunity to approach their music from new perspectives, abandoning their long-established roles and stylistic elements in favour of experimentation, spontaneity and electronica. Song construction became freer, with each musician playing multiple tracks on various instruments, to be cut down and refined into finished pieces later. The two likened their approach to a sculptor's creative process, the pieces gradually taking shape as the work went on. Early in 1994, they brought in Willson-Piper's childhood friend Andy 'Dare' Mason to produce, record and mix the album. It was recorded at Sydney's Karmic Hit Studios and mixed at Karmic Hit and Studios 301, except \"The Maven\", \"Leave Your Clothes On\" & \"Freeze to Burn\", which were recorded and mixed at Fryshuset, Stockholm, Sweden by Martin R\u00F6ssel. New Zealand drummer Tim Powles was hired for the Sydney sessions, having already played with Kilbey on the Jack Frost project. Considered temporary at the time, Powles would soon become a permanent member of the band and is still with them over 20 years later. Sometime Anywhere was generally well-received and peaked in the Australian Top 30. A 7-track bonus disc, entitled Somewhere Else, was included with the initial pressings. It was described as a \"rich, dark, epic release which picked up where Priest=Aura left off, with lush, lengthy tracks\". However, sales were lower than their previous studio albums and the first single, \"Two Places at Once\", did not chart. Promotion was minimal as Arista saw insufficient commercial promise in the release. With another commercially unsuccessful album on their hands, Arista did not renew The Church's contract and pulled financial support for a tour. Ambitious plans to stage full electric shows were scaled back, leaving Kilbey and Willson-Piper with only a short run of acoustic gigs as a duo. In 2005 the album was remastered and reissued in Australia by EMI, with a second disc which included all of the Somewhere Else tracks except \"Drought\" (which was moved to Priest=Aura), plus the radio and video edits of \"Two Places at Once\". Kilbey named his blog after the Somewhere Else track \"The Time Being\"."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Stranger in Us All is a 1995 album by the reformed hard rock band Rainbow. Guitarist Ritchie Blackmore put together a new version of Rainbow with little-known musicians in 1994. It was originally intended to be his solo album, but due to the label BMG pressures, the record was billed as Ritchie Blackmore's Rainbow. This line-up only released the one album before Blackmore decided to pursue different musical styles and formed Blackmore's Night with his companion Candice Night. As such, this album marks Blackmore's final hard rock recordings (to date). The album takes its name from a line in the song \"Black Masquerade\". Released in the post-grunge mid '90s, Stranger in Us All achieved a modest success, particularly in Europe. Much of the album was featured in the live concert sets. Drummer John O'Reilly was replaced for the tour by the returning Chuck Burgi. John Miceli joined the band for the US shows, from February to May 1997, plus one in Denmark. A live performance recorded at Philipshalle D\u00FCsseldorf for German TV 'Rockpalast' on October 9, 1995 was released on the DVD Black Masquerade in 2013. A few songs off the album were played live by the band Over the Rainbow in 2008 and 2009, as the line-up featured Greg Smith and Paul Morris, who played in Rainbow in 1995. The songs have been also performed occasionally by Doogie White, for example in 2004 with a band called White Noise. An official DVD recording of White Noise titled In the Hall of the Mountain King was released in 2004. The song \"Ariel\" was performed live by Blackmore's Night on their 2007 Paris Moon tour."@en ;

It is the first one recorded without the band's original members Todd Whitener, Matt Taul, and Jesse Vest. Vocalist Hugo Ferreira, the only remaining original member, was forced to scrap the original line-up's complete third album in favor of The End Begins, an effort established by new members of the band in addition to Ferreira. This is the only studio album to feature former Fuel drummer Kevin Miller. On January 13, 2009, The End Begins was re-released as a \"Digital Deluxe\" edition. This includes the bonus tracks \"Down & Out\" (Acoustic) and \"Fall Down.\" As of May 2009, the album has sold well over 70,000 copies. Left without a band, Hugo Ferreira scrapped the entire record. He began writing new material at his own studio before enlisting members of his side project, State of the Art, to record and tour as Tantric. These include ex-Fuel drummer Kevin Miller, ex-DramaGods bassist Joe Pessia on guitar, Fosterchild bassist Erik Leonhardt, and Marcus Ratzenboeck on electric violin, adding another dimension to the band. Ratzenboeck's brother Derek, a classical concert violinist, would composed the intro violin riff to the song \"Down & Out.\" With returning producer Toby Wright, the new line-up finished recording within 30 days in September 2007. The End Begins was released on April 22, 2008, and debuted at #91 on the Billboard 200. As of July 11, 2008, it has sold over 10,000 copies, with the lead single, \"Down & Out\" at #8 on the Billboard Mainstream Rock Chart. The song's popularity led it to become Tampa Bay Rays slugger Evan Longoria's walk-up theme. In regards to the album title, Hugo Ferreira cited the process up to its inception and stated, \"the end of one thing led to the beginning of another.\" He also noted that the majority of songs revolve around either the band itself or a troubled personal relationship he endured during the writing process. Ferreira described the album's lyrical themes in a November 2008 interview: Oddly, the only version of the physical End Begins album is a partially censored edition; the tracks \"The One\" and \"Monopoly\" are muted of explicit lyrics and listed as \"Clean\" when played on a PC. \"Love Song,\" however, frequently uses the word \"shit\" uncensored during its chorus. It appears that the only way of obtaining the two aforementioned songs uncensored is by purchasing them as mp3s via iTunes or Amazon.com or obtaining them through the band's manager. Based on crowd response to the song \"Fall Down,\" which was originally planned for Tantric III, the band rerecorded it without the Nappy Roots feature as their second single for a November 4, 2008 radio and iTunes release. The version of the song featuring Nappy Roots can only be found on YouTube because lead singer Hugo Ferreira leaked the song out to fans for appreciation. With this, they also announced a re-release of The End Begins including the said song as a bonus track. The \"Digital Deluxe\" edition, available January 13, 2009, also features an acoustic version of \"Down & Out\" but is evidently only available in download form."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Healthy in Paranoid Times is the sixth studio album by Canadian alternative rock band Our Lady Peace, released on August 30, 2005 by Columbia Records. The disc was released on a standard CD as well as a DualDisc, with the reverse side containing a documentary on the making of the album. The album fared well in both Canada and the U.S., but didn't match up to the success of its 2002 predecessor, Gravity. The first single was \"Where Are You\", released in Canada during June 2005 and released in the United States a month later. The second and third singles were \"Angels/Losing/Sleep\" and \"Will the Future Blame Us\", respectively. According to the album's liner notes, Healthy was recorded in 1165 days at ten different studios. 2000 hours were spent both discussing and playing music and 43 songs were written and recorded. Over 6000 GB of hard drive space was used for the recording. The band's inability to choose which songs they were satisfied with caused them to prolong recording and push back the release date several times. They came close to breaking up several times during the process. Healthy in Paranoid Times has a lighter sound and tone, and is less metaphorical than Our Lady Peace's pre-2002 releases. The second single, however, \"Angels/Losing/Sleep\" has vocalist Raine Maida singing at a higher pitch, making the jarred, falsetto-like voice Raine Maida and Our Lady Peace was formerly known for. Other songs, like \"Boy\", also have a lighter melody and vocals, instead of the heavier sounds on Gravity. The album mostly deals with current world events, and discusses issues such as war and the current state of the world, rather than the social and relationship themes featured on Gravity, however, some songs still features the social and relationship themes, which can be found in songs like Picture and Apology. It has been classified as a politically charged album. In particular, the song \"Wipe That Smile Off your Face\" was confirmed to be written about George W. Bush."@en ;

dbr:His_Band_and_the_Street_Choir	rdf:type	schema:MusicAlbum ;
	dbo:abstract	"His Band and the Street Choir (also referred to as Street Choir) is the fourth studio album by Northern Irish singer-songwriter Van Morrison. It was released on 15 November 1970 by Warner Bros. Records. Originally titled Virgo's Fool, Street Choir was renamed by Warner Bros. without Morrison's consent. Recording began in early 1970 with a demo session in a small church in Woodstock, New York. Morrison booked the A&R Studios on 46th Street in New York City in the second quarter of 1970 to produce two sessions of songs that were released on His Band and the Street Choir. Reviewers praised the music of both sessions for its free, relaxed sound, but the lyrics were considered to be simple compared with those of his previous work. Morrison had intended to record the album a cappella with only vocal backing by a vocal group he called the Street Choir, but the songs released on the album that included the choir also featured a backing band. Morrison was dissatisfied with additional vocalists to the original quintet that made up the choir, and these changes and others have led him to regard Street Choir poorly in later years. His Band and the Street Choir was as well received as Morrison's previous album, Moondance, peaking at number 32 on the Billboard 200 and number 18 on the UK Album Chart.

	dbo:abstract	"Love Kraft is the seventh studio album by Welsh indie rock band Super Furry Animals, released on 22 August 2005 through Epic Records in the United Kingdom. The album was recorded in Spain with producer Mario Caldato Jr and was something of a departure for the band, with all members contributing songs and lead vocals alongside Gruff Rhys who had been main songwriter for the Super Furries until this point. In selecting tracks for Love Kraft a conscious effort was made by the band not to choose songs on their individual merit but rather to pick those which went well together in order to create as cohesive an album as possible. The album's name was taken from a sex shop, Love Craft, near the Cardiff offices of the Super Furries' management team and is also a nod to American horror writer H. P. Lovecraft. Critical response was generally positive with some reviews claiming the album was the best of the group's career. However, a few reviewers expressed reservations that Love Kraft was \"merely a very good Super Furry Animals effort\" and was not as impressive as the band's previous records. The track \"Lazer Beam\" was released as a single and reached #28 in the UK Singles Chart."@en ;

dbr:Love_Letters_from_Elvis	rdf:type	schema:MusicAlbum ;
	dbo:abstract	"Love Letters from Elvis is the twelfth studio album by Elvis Presley, released in 1971. The album was made up of leftovers from Elvis' marathon June 1970 recording sessions in Nashville. Most of the other 35 songs recorded during those sessions had been used in Elvis' 1970 albums That's the Way It Is and Elvis Country (I'm 10,000 Years Old). Wanting to squeeze out a third album from the sessions, RCA records had producer Felton Jarvis mix, overdub and compile the remaining songs. The album was critically panned upon release, and failed to crack the top 20 of the Billboard album charts but did reach #12 on the US Top Country Albums chart and #7 on the UK best-selling albums chart. The song's title track was a rare instance of Presley re-recording a past hit in the studio, his original version of \"Love Letters\" having been released as a single in 1966. \"Got My Mojo Working\" is edited down from an impromptu jam session; Presley's version incorporates lyrics from \"Hands Off\", a 1955 song by Frankie Castro released on the Wing record label (RCA often mislabelled this song \"Keep Your Hands Off of It\" when the complete jam was issued on CD years later). Three songs from this album were released on singles. The single \"Life / Only Believe\" was released in March 1971 and reached only #53 on the US Billboard Singles chart. It was Elvis's lowest chart position for a single since \"Almost in Love\" had reached #95 in late 1968. \"Heart Of Rome\" was placed on the B-side of the non-album track \"I'm Leavin released as a single in August 1971 it reached #23 in the UK and #83 in Australia."@en ;

dbr:McDonald_and_Giles	rdf:type	schema:MusicAlbum ;
	dbo:abstract	"McDonald and Giles is an album of music released by British musicians Ian McDonald and Michael Giles in 1971. The album was first issued on Island Records (ILPS 9126) in the UK and in the US as Cotillion Records (SD 9042), a division of Atlantic Records. The album was recorded at Island Studios between May and July 1970. Although McDonald and Giles remains popular among King Crimson fans,[citation needed] its commercial success was limited. The duo did not record a second album. Ian McDonald and Michael Giles were members of the original King Crimson line-up, and were featured performers on the band's debut album, In the Court of the Crimson King (1969). Both left the group at the end of its first North American tour in 1969, although Giles appeared on the second King Crimson album, In the Wake of Poseidon (1970), as a session musician. Two other King Crimson members also worked on McDonald and Giles: Peter Giles and Peter Sinfield. The music on McDonald and Giles contains many of the pastoral and musically complex elements of King Crimson, while generally avoiding that band's darker tendencies. The song \"Flight of the Ibis\" has a similar melody and rhythm to King Crimson's \"Cadence and Cascade\", with different lyrics. The album contains a guest appearance by Steve Winwood, playing organ and piano on \"Turnham Green\". Winwood's group Traffic were working on John Barleycorn Must Die at Island Studios at the same time. Michael Giles' drum solo in \"Tomorrow's People \u2013 The Children of Today\" has been sampled by a number of rap and hip-hop artists, most notably the Beastie Boys, on the track \"Body Movin'\" from the album Hello Nasty.[citation needed] The first CD edition was released in Japan in the early 1990s. It came in both jewel box and paper sleeve versions. This version was the same as the original vinyl but was mastered from a tape copy several generations removed from the original master. In 2002 the group members authorised a revised version of the CD with improved sound. The revised version can be recognised by the use of green lettering on the cover instead of pink. A phrase near the beginning of \"Suite in C\" has slightly different lyrics. Some of the tracks of the 2002 edition have very minor editing. There are a few slightly different segues in the song \"Birdman\" and the sections of this song are marked as separate tracks on the CD."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"The Allman Brothers Band is the debut studio album by American rock band the Allman Brothers Band. It was released in the United States by Atco Records and Capricorn Records on November 4, 1969 and produced by Adrian Barber. Formed in 1969, the Allman Brothers Band came together following various musical pursuits by each individual member. Following his session work in Muscle Shoals, Alabama, Duane Allman moved to Jacksonville, Florida where he led large jam sessions with his new band, one he had envisioned as having two guitarists and two drummers. After rounding out the lineup with the addition of his brother, Gregg Allman, the band played free shows in public parks and moved to Macon, Georgia, where they were to be one of the premiere acts on Capricorn. The album was recorded and mixed in two weeks at Atlantic Studios in New York City. Much of the material presented was premiered live over the preceding months and combines blues, jazz and country music to varying degrees. It includes re-workings of \"Trouble No More\" and \"Don't Want You No More,\" as well as notable originals such as \"Dreams\", which highlighted the band's jazz influence, and \"Whipping Post\", which soon became a crowd favorite. Although the group was arranged to work with producer Tom Dowd (whose credits included Cream and John Coltrane), he was unavailable, and they instead recorded with house engineer Adrian Barber. The album's artwork was photographed at various places in Macon and surrounding areas. The record initially received a poor commercial response, charting in the lower levels of Billboard's Top 200 Pop Albums chart. Despite this, the album received critical acclaim from publications such as Rolling Stone, who called it \"consistently [...] subtle, and honest, and moving.\" Following the release of the album, the band remained on the road for an extended period of time. They chose to remain in Macon, despite suggestions from label executives to move to larger cities for a better shot at commercial acceptance."@en ;

dbr:Bent_Out_of_Shape	rdf:type	schema:MusicAlbum ;
	dbo:abstract	"Bent Out of Shape is the seventh studio album released by the British hard rock band Rainbow. It was originally released in August 1983 as an LP and cassette. The cassette featured several longer edits compared to the vinyl version. It was recorded at Sweet Silence Studios in Copenhagen in about 7 weeks. A remastered CD reissue was released in May 1999, which restored the artwork of the original release. This has two tracks of a longer duration than on the first US CD issue. This album is generally referred to by critics and fans as a commercial effort, with the band attempting to repeat the success of the song \"Stone Cold\" and the album Straight Between the Eyes. As a result, some of the songs, like the first single released from this album, \"Street of Dreams\", are usually considered to be more in the album-oriented rock style, instead of the hard rock sound of earlier Rainbow albums. The album was particularly aimed at the US market: the title is an American idiom rather than a British one, although it received positive reviews in the U.K. Howard Johnson of \"Kerrang!\" magazine (No.51 \u2013 Sept 22-Oct 5, 1983) praised the album as \"possibly Rainbow's most complete work to date\" and called \"Desperate Heart\" and \"Street of Dreams\" \"two of this year's finest tunes\". The music video for \"Can't Let You Go\", directed by Dominic Orlando, was filmed in New York City (1984) and inspired by the 1920 silent b/w film The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari. Along with \"Street of Dreams\", directed by Storm Thorgerson, it became a part of Rainbow's home video collection The Final Cut (1985). The music video for \"Street of Dreams\" was banned by MTV for its supposedly controversial hypnotic clip. The song \"Street of Dreams\" has been re-recorded in two versions by Blackmore's Night in 2006 for their fifth studio album, The Village Lanterne. The version featured on a regular album was sung by Candice Night. The other version, a bonus track on a special edition of the album, was performed in a duet by Night and former Rainbow singer Joe Lynn Turner. In 1984 \"Anybody There\" was nominated to Grammy Award as the Best Rock Instrumental Performance."@en ;

The tracks \"A Southern Thing\" and \"Our Last Night\" also gained some radio airplay. Additionally, the album track \"Juicy\" was the featured music in promotions for the second season of the ABC series Desperate Housewives. Prior to the album's release, the band offered to autograph all copies of the album pre-ordered through their website. The album title reportedly came to the band's drummer Travis McNabb in a dream. He dreamt of seeing a UK buzz band called Before the Robots. The next day, he asked fellow band members if there was such a band. Upon finding out there was not, they decided to adopt the phrase for this album's title. On January 22, 2010, American country-pop singer Taylor Swift covered \"Breathless\" at a performance at the Hope for Haiti Now: A Global Benefit for Earthquake Relief event, a charity telethon to benefit the victims of the 2010 Haiti earthquake.

It features some of the highly romantic style similar to 1981's The Garden album, although in many ways lacking the finesse of the earlier record. Largely missing from this recording is many of the styles Foxx was known for (such as glam inspired art rock, punk and minimal synthpop) in favor of a more soulful, contemporary pop sound. The lyrics are of discovery and rediscovery and there is lots of vibrato-laden organ playing on this record. There are acoustic guitars, mid-1980s home studio-sounding rhythm machines, live drums and glimpses of Cathedral Oceans -style ambient music in places\u2014particularly in the \"Enter The Angel\" reprise. Although Cathedral Oceans was not released until 12 years later, Foxx has stated he started working on the material as early as 1983. The cover art is in the collage style he had been presenting to his public since the early Ultravox! days. An expanded edition was released in 2001 and a 2CD 'deluxe edition' in 2008. Both of these CD reissues contain a running track order that is different than the original release."@en ;

The album ranked number one for 21 weeks on the Billboard 200, due primarily to the success of the single \"U Can't Touch This\". The song has been and continues to be used in many movies and television shows to date, and appears on soundtrack/compilation albums as well. Likewise, the album saw longevity on the Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart at number one because it peaked there for 28 weeks. Hammer, being good friends with Arsenio Hall, was invited to first perform \"U Can't Touch This\" prior to its release, on The Arsenio Hall Show in late 1989. He also performed \"Please Hammer, Don't Hurt 'Em\", a song that didn't make it on this album, but did appear in his movie by the same name. The album singles released all proved to be successful on radio and video television, with \"U Can't Touch This\", \"Pray\", \"Have You Seen Her\", \"Here Comes the Hammer\" and \"Yo!! Sweetness\" (UK only) all charting. The album raised rap music to a new level of popularity. It was the first hip-hop album certified diamond by the RIAA for sales of over ten million.

Its three songs were holdovers from the Wind & Wuthering sessions, which the band felt did not fit the overall feel of the album. Upon its release, the EP managed to reach No. 14 in the UK singles charts. Although the EP market never took off in North America, their overseas distributor, Atlantic Records, released Spot The Pigeon in Canada as a 12-inch, on a limited edition blue vinyl. This was Genesis' final studio release before lead guitarist Steve Hackett's departure later in 1977. His discontent was that he was not able to get more of his songs onto Wind & Wuthering and was further aggravated when \"Inside and Out,\" which he felt was worthy of inclusion on the album, was relegated to this EP. Although Spot the Pigeon saw a CD release, it has since been deleted. Two of its three tracks, \"Pigeons\" and \"Inside and Out\" appeared on the band's 2000 box set Genesis Archive 2: 1976-1992: \"Match of the Day\" was not included due to the band's dislike of the song.[citation needed] It was eventually made available on CD with the 2007 release of Genesis 1976-1982, thus making the entire EP available for the first time on CD in the U.S. \"Pigeons\" and \"Inside and Out\" have been also released on Turn It On Again: The Hits \u2013 The Tour Edition.

dbr:In_Search_of_The	rdf:type	schema:MusicAlbum ;
	dbo:abstract	"In Search of The is a set of thirteen albums by Buckethead, released on February 21, 2007. Each was initially personally numbered and monogrammed by Buckethead himself. No two sets were the same, as the covers were hand-drawn and unique from one another. It is considered a special release, making it the first of Buckethead's albums to be referred to as such. According to Travis Dickerson: The original project started as an even more ambitious project than the one released. Dickerson explained that the project consisted of a series of 13-CD box sets that when completed and stacked would spell out the phrase \"In Search Of The Disembodied Sounds\". However, due to the popular demand of this section of the project, the original idea was scrapped, as it became an exhausting endeavor to cover the demand for this boxset. The original box set could be purchased as either a box set or separately. There seems to be no underlying theme or thread to the songs on the separate discs, and they feature many different and diverse styles of music. In addition, each song stands alone; none of the tracks fade into each other. The set also lacks any type of track listing as all the songs are untitled, however, unofficial track names have been assigned by fans of Buckethead which are known to reflect his personality and his previous work. As such, references to past material are present. There are a total of 92 songs in the set ranging in lengths from 0:33 to 19:45, not including \"Vol. 13: E\" which is one unbroken 45-minute track. Buckethead drew the covers on each set of In Search of The until he reached the 1000th copy. However, mistakes were made in the numbering, and whole stretches of numbers were skipped during the production of the personalized edition of the box set. Dickerson estimates that the actual number of boxsets produced might be around 800 copies with the final number written being 1000. All further copies available are no longer hand-made and feature the same artwork from set to set. There are no credits to the set's name, so it is likely that all of the music on the set was performed solely by Buckethead; however, this has not yet been confirmed."@en ;

dbr:The_Marshall_Suite	rdf:type	schema:MusicAlbum ;
	dbo:abstract	"The Marshall Suite is a 1999 album by The Fall. The album builds on the techno-influenced beats of its predecessor Levitate (1997), while also returning to a more rockabilly-influenced sound reminiscent of earlier Fall line-ups. The end result has songs like the catchy \"Touch Sensitive\", and the strange, complex, thumping jungle beats of \"Crying Marshall\". The album was long out of print, but a new 3-disc edition was released in the summer of 2011. The Marshall Suite was made immediately after an American tour during which Mark E. Smith had an onstage fight with members of the band and was arrested following ongoing altercations at the hotel where the group were staying. While the remaining band members quit and returned to England, leaving Smith in a cell in Manhattan, Nagle chose to stay in the band, helping to assemble a new line-up of the group. This new line-up was still taking shape during the recording of the album; the group shed a drummer before recording could even begin, and the album features two different bassists. For these reasons, it is something of a patchwork: out of 13 tracks, \"On My Own\" is a reworking of the previous album's \"Everybody But Myself\", three tracks are covers, two are sound collages, and \"The Crying Marshal\" is a remix by producer Steven Hitchcock of a Smith collaboration with the Filthy Three (\"Real Life of the Crying Marshal\"). Two songs use some of the same lyrics (a 14th track, \"Tom Raggazzi\" - a reggae-tinged reprise of \"Anecdotes...\" - was included on the vinyl version). Nevertheless, the album was well received. Around the time of its release, rumours circulated that The Marshall Suite was a concept album about \"The Crying Marshall\". Smith stopped short of denying this, telling The Wire that \"I thought it would be good to do it as the story of his life, a themed LP, with a thread running through it. It's such an unhip thing to do\". An unpublished section of the interview, later placed on the magazine's website, suggested Smith was not yet finished with his creation: \"I do want to continue the Marshall theme, develop it. Maybe a five-sided thing next, the return of the Marshall\". However, he does not appear to have returned to the theme on any subsequent Fall album. An edit of the album's opening track \"Touch Sensitive\" was used in the UK as a soundtrack to an advert for the Vauxhall Corsa."@en ;

This was the first album where Mortiis took the role as lead vocalist, which had previously been filled by Sarah Jezebel Deva. Mortiis looks back on this album, and is amazed at how 'gothic' it sounds - even though it wasn't intended.[citation needed] In the booklet, Mortiis is seen unmasked under the pseudonym of 'John Prozac'.

	dbo:abstract	"Chapter V is the fifth studio album from American rock band Staind. It was released on August 9, 2005, debuted at number 1 with first week sales of 185,000 copies, and has spawned 1 big hit single along with three moderately successful singles on rock radio. Its first single \"Right Here\" was the most successful at both rock and pop stations and it was used in a video package by World Wrestling Entertainment commemorating wrestler Edge after he won his first WWE Championship. \"Falling\" and \"Everything Changes\" have also been released with accompanying videos. Lead singer Aaron Lewis has stated that he thinks 'Chapter V is the best record the band has released to date', and the album continues the evolution from the messages on 14 Shades of Grey to messages of hope and uncertainty. It also showcases a heavier side to the band on selected tracks (reminiscent of some content on Dysfunction), and emphasizes a balance between both style of the band's sound. The album includes a track called \"Paper Jesus\" targeted at record company executives who idolize money instead of music and \"Reply\", an open letter replying to fan mail that Aaron Lewis and the rest of the band have received over the years (the original version can be found on the Special Edition). Since its release, it has sold 1,200,000 copies in the United States and 1,500,000 worldwide. However, it marked Staind's lowest debut so far in the UK, at number 112. All the same, it was regarded as one of the most anticipated albums of the year in the U.S. before its release. A special edition, with five bonus tracks, an extra booklet and a DVD was released several months later. Even after a full year, it remained fairly consistent on the Billboard 200. Aaron Lewis has said in relation to this in the booklet of the Special Edition of the album: \"Having three straight number one albums was a nice big fuck you to a lot of people who have slagged us. Nobody can ever take away that fact.\" Staind have promoted the album by allowing selected fans to preview it on their tour bus, and touring after its release for a whole year, including mini tours to Australia and solo tours across Europe, as well as the famous Fall Brawl Tour with Flyleaf, Taproot and P.O.D. The band have also toured with 3 Doors Down, Hurt, Three Days Grace, Breaking Benjamin, and Seether (later cancelled) across the United States to promote the album."@en ;

According to Frusciante: \"These songs were written while I was on tour for By the Way. I was listening to the Velvet Underground a lot. It's only four songs and fifteen minutes long. I'm used to producing my records myself, and when I left that in the hands of Fugazi's Ian MacKaye, using equipment that wasn't mine, playing instruments that weren't mine, everything was different.\" The guitar tracks that appear were recorded with one of Guy Picciotto's Marshall JCM 800 amplifiers, the same featured on the artwork for the Fugazi album, Red Medicine. For the guitar solo on \"Dissolve,\" Frusciante also used Picciotto's Les Paul Junior. On the vinyl release of the EP, the words \"And then the past\" were inscribed on side A, and \"I never see you\" on side B, referring to Frusciante's forthcoming album, Curtains. The vinyl edition of the record saw a repressing from Record Collection on December 11, 2012. These reissued records are 180 gram and come with a download of choice between MP3 and WAV formats of the album. The title DC EP refers to the place near where it was recorded, Washington DC.

dbr:Long_Live_the_Kane	rdf:type	schema:MusicAlbum ;
	dbo:abstract	"Long Live the Kane is the debut album by MC Big Daddy Kane, released by Cold Chillin' Records in 1988. It was produced by Marley Marl and established both as premier artists during hip hop's golden age. Kane displayed his unique rapping technique while covering topics including love (\"I'll Take You There\"), Afrocentricity (\"Word to the Mother(Land)\") and his rapping prowess (\"Set It Off\"). Marley Marl and Big Daddy Kane display a sparse production style - creating beats with fast-paced drums and lightly utilized James Brown samples. Four singles were released in promotion of Kane's first album: \"Raw/Word to the Mother (Land),\" \"Ain't No Half-Steppin'/Get Into It,\" \"I'll Take You There/Wrath of Kane\" and \"Set It Off/Get Into It.\" The most commercially successful of these singles were \"Ain't No Half-Steppin'\", which reached #53 on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Singles & Tracks chart, and \"I'll Take You There\", which reached #73 on the same chart, but also peaked at #21 on the Hot Rap Singles chart. The other two singles did not chart, but \"Raw\" and \"Set It Off\" popularized Big Daddy Kane's high-speed style and abundant use of word play. \"Raw\" and \"Ain't No Half Steppin'\" are both described as \"underground sensation[s]\" and \"classic[s]\" by Allmusic's Steve Huey. \"Raw\" does not appear on Long Live the Kane, but a remix which utilizes the same beat does. Big Daddy Kane's debut album contains many tracks that were later featured on greatest hits compilations. \"Ain't No Half Steppin'\" alone is featured on The Very Best of Big Daddy Kane, Marley Marl's House of Hits, two \"best of\" Cold Chillin' Records compilations and over five additional hip-hop hit compilations. Nowithstanding \"Ain't No Half Steppin',\" The Very Best of Big Daddy Kane contains five songs from Kane's debut album. Allmusic's Steve Huey regards \"'Raw,' 'Set It Off,' and 'Ain't No Half-Steppin' [as] flawless bids for immortality [that] haven't lost an ounce of energy.\" The album is broken down track-by-track by Big Daddy Kane in Brian Coleman's book Check the Technique."@en ;

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Loveboat_(album)>	rdf:type	schema:MusicAlbum ;
	dbo:abstract	"Loveboat is the ninth full-length studio album by British synthpop group Erasure. Released in the UK by Mute Records in 2000, it was produced by Erasure and Flood. It proved to be their least successful in terms of sales and charts since their debut Wonderland in 1986. Erasure's U.S. record label at the time, Maverick Records, shelved the album because of \"lack of hit singles.\" Largely panned by Erasure fans upon its release (and even by Andy Bell years after) because of its greater use of acoustic guitars, its lo-fi feel and heavy-handed bass sounds (many blame Flood's production work), the album did manage to get some positive reviews by music critics. Loveboat failed to hit the Top 40 in the UK and two singles were released, although only one was eligible to chart. Maverick Records requested the re-recording and remixing of several tracks from the album before they would agree to release it. Although \"Moon & the Sky\" was reworked, Maverick never released it and dropped Erasure from its artist roster. Three years after its UK release, Mute Records secured rights to finally release it in its original form in the U.S. in 2003. The CG model and cover artwork rendering was produced by Martin Gardiner. It was actually released in the States after Erasure's follow-up album Other People's Songs. Loveboat did not chart on the Billboard 200."@en ;

The story given is that an eccentric character named Edgar Graham met with Modest Mouse while on tour. During their time together, Graham and the band recorded a few songs together, and Graham completely disappeared. In an attempt to get Graham to resurface, Brock took the recordings to Sub Pop Records, redid them in the studio, and had them released as Sharpen Your Teeth. A follow-up is highly unlikely due to contractual obligations Brock has with Modest Mouse's label Epic Records.

However, it became his best-selling studio album in the UK, reaching #2 on the charts (his highest position in eight years) and achieving platinum status with 300,000 copies sold (the only other Dylan album to do this was The Essential Bob Dylan). The original 1978 LP credits mastering to Stan Kalina at CBS Recording Studios NY; the album was produced by Don DeVito. In 1999, Street-Legal received a special remixing and remastering job from DeVito. The newer version boasted richer sound, correcting numerous issues with the original production.

Some new instruments feature in this album, following the band's acoustic tour in 2009.

Black Light District was released under The Gathering's own label Psychonaut Records, and it is the label's very first completely new release, however, since EP does not qualify as an album, the later released Souvenirs is widely regarded as the very first brand new album release of the label."@en ;

On the strength of this success, Reader received Best British Female at the BRIT Awards the following year. Two additional singles were released: \"Joke (I\u2019m Laughing)\" and \"Dear John\". The latter was co-written by Kirsty MacColl and originally intended for her 1993 album Titanic Days.

The limited edition A, however, also came with a DVD movie entitled \"Zukkoke Treasure Panic!\". Limited Edition B featured a hidden bonus track on the Member Solos disc. Musically, the album is a complete 180 from their previous album. Majority of the songs are of the Funk/Disco genre, notable tracks being \"Big Sky Blues\", \"Speedy Wonder\", and the album's title track, \" Great Escape ~Dai Dassou~ \". Kanjani Eight do dive right back into their 'enka/kayokyoku' roots with the song, \"Futari no Namida Ame\", but the rest of the album takes off with generic pop and rock. The most noticeable change in this album, compared to last, is the creative control the group displays in the member solos. All the solos, save for You Yokoyama's, were written and/or composed by the members themselves.

All performances featured on the DVD are radically re-worked from the original album versions; for \"Hyperballad\" she is accompanied by electra strings; \"Venus as a Boy\" with Guy Sigsworth on harpsichord; \"Possibly Maybe\" with a full band featuring legendary slide guitarist BJ Cole; \"Bachelorette\" and \"Hunter\" with an Icelandic String Octet and Mark Bell, \"J\u00F3ga\" with an Icelandic String Octet and \"So Broken\" accompanied by world famous Flamenco guitarist Raimundo Amador. Bj\u00F6rk had also performed \"Aeroplane\" on the show with D'Influence (her first ever live performance as a solo artist) but it is not included on the DVD, although it is erroneously mentioned on the insert track listing. The performance of \"J\u00F3ga\" also appears on another Jools Holland DVD (Later With Jools Holland: Mellow), which was released in 2006. All the performances are of album tracks apart from \"So Broken\" which is a B-side to the J\u00F3ga single. The Video Album was re-released in 2012 as Later with Jools Holland 1995\u20132011, including the latter performances from Bj\u00F6rk in 2007 and 2011, promoting Volta and Biophilia respectively."@en ;

dbr:Life_in_a_Tin_Can	rdf:type	schema:MusicAlbum ;
	dbo:abstract	"Life in a Tin Can is the Bee Gees' eleventh studio album (ninth worldwide), released in January 1973. The Bee Gees moved their base of operations from England to Los Angeles to record Life in a Tin Can. However, it was unable to prevent a commercial decline with the album criticised for a lack of innovation.[citation needed] Despite its low sales and poor chart performance, Life in a Tin Can was awarded \"Album of the Year\" by Record World magazine. It was the first Bee Gees album to bear the RSO label in the US. The lead track, \"Saw a New Morning\", contains melodic ideas that the group later revisited on the track \"Edge of the Universe\".[citation needed] Four of the eight songs were written by all three brothers with the other four being Barry Gibb compositions. The album reached No. 10 on the Italian charts and sold 175,000 copies worldwide. \"Saw a New Morning\" was a No. 1 hit in Hong Kong. No recording dates are available for the sessions on this album. At the time of the sessions, Robin Gibb had to leave the sessions suddenly when his son Spencer was born a month early. That date was 21 September. Atlantic Records' log dates the whole album as 22 September. Robin returned to Los Angeles a week or so later to continue on into the next album. The musicians who participated on Life in a Tin Can were Jim Keltner, Sneaky Pete Kleinow, Tommy Morgan, Jerome Richardson, Rick Grech, Jane Getz and Johnny Pate. When asked by Billboard why they moved from London to Los Angeles, Maurice Gibb says: \"We don't want to talk about it yet. But we're going to attempt a concept album that's a major departure from our usual Bee Gees trademarks. And if that doesn't work out, we'll do something else\"."@en ;

In addition, it won the 2010 Hawaii Music Award for Best Ukulele Album. AllMusic noted that, \"Shimabukuro is a monster musician and boldly takes the ukulele where no ukulele has ever gone before, dazzling listeners with his blinding speed, melodic invention, and open-ended improvisations of remarkable virtuosity. Before Shimabukuro, the idea of spending an evening listing to a solo ukulele player was probably most people's idea of hell, but the 17 solo efforts here never bore.

It circulated for many years just amongst a small group of fans who knew of its existence before surfacing a decade later at Hellcat Records. The concert, a benefit for striking firefighters, was originally recorded on 15 November 2002 at Acton Town Hall in London, and features one of the final live performances by Strummer (the last live show being in Liverpool on 22 November 2002), who died due to a heart condition on 22 December 2002. The performance features songs Strummer recorded with The Clash along with songs from Strummer's albums for Hellcat Records including new written songs such as \"Coma Girl\" and \"Get Down Moses\" that eventually would appear on Strummer's posthumous album, Streetcore. The highlight of the performance features a reunion with Strummer's former bandmate from The Clash, Mick Jones for the first time in almost twenty years.

This collection is the most expansive compilation ever issued of their music, with 30 tracks clocking in at over 76 minutes and grabbing nearly every US Top 40 hit of their career, except for 1965's number 20 hit \"The Little Girl I Once Knew\", and the 1976 top-30 hit \"It's O.K.\". In 2011, Mike Love stated, \"Sounds of Summer is fast approaching selling three million copies \u2013 if it's triple-platinum, which is, you know, pretty good. And by the time this 50th celebration is over, it'll probably be more than triple-platinum.\" Sounds of Summer: The Very Best of The Beach Boys was released in a market already containing the three volumes of hits issued during 1999 and 2000, but that did little to deter shoppers, who were responsible for shooting the CD into the US charts at number 16 (their highest peak since 1976's 15 Big Ones) and a lengthy 104-week stay. Currently certified triple platinum, Sounds of Summer: The Very Best of The Beach Boys was re-issued with a DVD component in 2004 with the regular edition remaining available. In 2007, the album was succeeded by The Warmth of the Sun, which is composed of fan favorites and hits that were left off Sounds of Summer.

	dbo:abstract	"The Art of Rebellion is the sixth studio album by American crossover thrash band Suicidal Tendencies. It was released in 1992 on the Sony Music label. It is widely considered to be Suicidal's \"experimental\" album. Mike Clark himself acknowledged this, but also mentioned that the album was not planned that way, and was just a reflection of the band's musical growth. The songs show the band's continuing experimentation with funk that had begun on this album's predecessor, Lights...Camera...Revolution!, as well as more progressive song structures, a somewhat more alternative atmosphere, and even pop-oriented sounds. This helped the band not only outride the explosion of alternative in the early 1990s, it also helped them gain a fan base within that community. Nonetheless, the album still stays true to the band's thrash and punk roots on many of the songs. At almost 60 minutes long, The Art of Rebellion was Suicidal Tendencies' longest album to date up until 2013's 13. Singles included \"Nobody Hears,\" \"Asleep At The Wheel,\" and the band's most successful single yet, \"I'll Hate You Better.\" It has since achieved gold status and peaked at number 52 on the Billboard 200. Longtime drummer R.J. Herrera left the band prior to the recording of the album. The band actually performed as an incomplete four-piece throughout the tour for this album. Josh Freese was drafted to play drums for the album, but had no creative input and did not appear on the back cover of the album. However, the new drummer Jimmy Degrasso is seen in the band's video for \"Nobody Hears.\""@en ;

dbr:Young_Pilgrim	rdf:type	schema:MusicAlbum ;
	dbo:abstract	"Young Pilgrim is the debut studio album by British singer-songwriter Charlie Simpson. The album was produced by Danton Supple (Doves, Coldplay) and was released on 15 August 2011 through independent label PIAS Recordings. Following the extended hiatus announced by Fightstar in 2010, Simpson began writing solo material in conjunction with fan funding website Pledge Music. The platform was launched in 2009, as an innovative new way of involving fans in the record making process. Fans \"pledge\" to receive a copy of the completed project (an album or EP), while also having the chance to purchase exclusive extras such as private gigs, music video appearances, or even providing backing vocals during recording. Simpson first issued new material on Christmas day 2010, releasing a \"pledgers only\" EP entitled When We Were Lions. The EP and subsequent singles, garnered praise from music critics, seeing \"Down Down Down\" selected as \"Record of the Week\" by BBC Radio 1 presenter Fearne Cotton. Simpson has described his solo work as \"something completely different\", while it has been noted the album contains elements of melancholy, similar to the works of The National, Bon Iver, and Jackson Browne. Young Pilgrim's physical release was put under strain after all 30,000 copies of the album were destroyed in an arson fire at the warehouse and distribution center for PIAS Entertainment Group during the 2011 London Riots on 8 August 2011. However, it was confirmed the following day that despite the damages, the album would still be released as planned on 15 August. The release proved a success for Simpson and the independent label, entering the UK Albums Chart at number six."@en ;

Following the poor chart performance, \"I Got a Thang for You\" featuring Keyshia Cole, was released as the album's second single. The album's third and final single \"Look Back at Me\" featuring Killer Mike, which it was produced by Hard Hat Productions, became a regional hit club record and accompanied by a music video. The album garnered positive reviews from critics, most of whom praised the vigorous sexual-lyrics most have become accustomed to from Trina. However multiple critics showed disregard for some of the album's mid-tempo tracks as attempts to recapture the success of \"Here We Go\".

According to Arthur: \"the philosophy of the whole record was sort of a letting go, that's why I called it Let's Just Be, because it was like everything about that record [came from] a Zen-like approach. Just letting things be how they are.\" Let's Just Be was released seven months after his previous album, Nuclear Daydream. The band recorded the album in a quick stint while touring in Southern California in 2006 at Mathias Schneeberger's studio. Arthur notes that: \"the idea for us was to record all of these new songs straight to tape using only 16 tracks with no reverb, sort of a back to basics like how the Stones or Neil Young used to record. These albums are really a band effort, there was a lot of collaboration in the studio and quite a few songs on the album were co-writes.\" There is a standard edition and a special edition (featuring different artwork) of the album available (in the US only, released on May 15, 2007). The album version of \"Diamond Ring\" is featured as the B-side to the UK single of \"Enough to Get Away,\" released August 27, 2007. The album version of \"Take Me Home\" is featured as the B-side to the single of \"Honey and the Moon,\" released March 26, 2007."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Nina Sings the Hits of Diane Warren is the fourth studio album by Filipino singer Nina, released in the Philippines on July 25, 2008 by Warner Music. It is a cover album consisting of Nina's renditions of familiar love songs written by American songwriter Diane Warren. The idea behind the release of the album started after the success of her single \"I Don't Want to Be Your Friend\" in 2004, which was initially recorded for Warren's love songs compilation. Upon release, the album received negative response from critics, most reviewers pointing out the over-singing and lack of emotion. Despite criticisms, the album proved to be a commercial hit, certifying gold by the Philippine Association of the Record Industry (PARI) on September 1, 2008. It was considered to be a late awarding, since the album sold enough for a gold certification in its first week of commercial release. It has sold over 30,000 units and has been awarded Platinum by the PARI to date. The album has been released internationally, mostly in South-East Asian countries. However, Warner failed to promote it in the mentioned territories because they were busy promoting Charice's self-titled 2010 album. Two singles were commercially released off the album. \"I Don't Want to Miss a Thing\", an Aerosmith original, was the first single. It featured a mellow arrangement and soft vocal delivery, entirely opposite to the original arrangement. The song became a chart-topping hit and is considered to be one of Nina's trademark singles. \"There You'll Be\" was released as a follow-up single. Nina personally chose the song, and considers it as a \"Thank You\" to her fans who were always there to support her. \"Saving Forever for You\" was released to radio in 2009 as a promo single to boost up album sales."@en ;

The band, who greatly enjoy Christmas, had previously recorded Christmas songs and enjoyed the process so much that they wanted to produce a full-length album. After releasing a studio album in early 2004, they decided to take time off; they realized they could record a Christmas album over that period and began work in December 2004. The band, aiming to produce a rock-oriented album, recruited Bannister, a noted rock producer, to produce it. In addition to one original song, \"Joseph's Lullaby\", the album consists of covers of both modern and traditional Christmas songs that the band members had listened to when growing up. Upon its release, The Christmas Sessions received positive reviews from critics. Praise was offered for the album's production qualities, as well as the change in direction for MercyMe and the band's take on the traditional songs. Minor criticism was directed at lead vocalist Bart Millard's vocals, as well as at individual songs. The album reached a peak of number three on the Billboard Christian Albums chart, number ten on the Holiday Albums chart, and number sixty-four on the Billboard 200. Multiple songs from the album appeared on record charts, including \"Joseph's Lullaby\", which peaked at number one on the Christian Songs chart; \"God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen\" and \"Little Drummer Boy\" also appeared in the top ten on the chart, peaking at numbers nine and ten, respectively, and \"Silent Night\" reached a peak of number six on the Adult Contemporary chart."@en ;

The album was originally to have been released in 1997 under the title Tore Up from the Floor Up, with a cover of Glen Campbell's \"Wichita Lineman\" serving as the lead-off single. After this cover failed to reach Top 40, however, it was replaced with \"The Day That She Left Tulsa\" and the album was re-titled, with \"Wichita Lineman\" not making the album's final cut. The track \"Summer Was a Bummer\" was previously cut by Ty Herndon on his 1995 debut album What Mattered Most."@en ;

Destination Failure was not as successful as the band's previous album Born to Quit; it failed to chart despite the release a single and music video for \"I Know You Love Me\". The album was recorded at the Chicago Recording Company and at Conway Studios in Hollywood with producer Jerry Finn and recording engineer Phil Bonnet. Bonnet had worked with the band since early in their career, engineering and producing their EPs Break Up and 2 as well as Born to Quit. The songs \"Let's Hear It for Love\" and \"Can't Find It\" are new recordings of songs from the Get Fired. The Destination Failure version of \"Can't Find It\" is slower than the original version. \"I Know You Love Me\" references singer and guitarist Josh Caterer's newfound interest in Christianity, while \"You Spoke to Me\" refers to Blake Schwarzenbach of Jawbreaker and Jets to Brazil, who the Smoking Popes had toured with. \"Paul\" is about enduring an ex-lover's affection for her new man.

dbr:Far_Side_Virtual	rdf:type	schema:MusicAlbum ;
	dbo:abstract	"Far Side Virtual is a 2011 album by James Ferraro, released digitally and on vinyl by the label Hippos in Tanks. The album marked Ferraro's transition from his previous style of lo-fi drone music toward a sharply produced electronic aesthetic. Far Side Virtual deliberately evokes the artificial style of corporate \"elevator music\" and obsolete computer sounds. Ferraro said he first conceived of the album for release as a series of ringtones, and that listeners using songs from the album as ringtones is the completion of the project. The album engages with concepts of hyperreality, simulacra, disposable consumer culture, 1990s retro-futurism, advertising and branding, pop art, and musical kitsch. Critics have found Ferraro's attitude toward his themes ambiguous, depicting the modern world as both bleak dystopia and uncanny utopia. The album received generally favorable reviews, with many critics admiring its conceptual underpinnings as much as, or more than, the quality of the music itself. The album also had its vocal detractors; particularly, its position as UK music magazine The Wire's number one release of the year was met with contention from some readers. Far Side Virtual has been cited as one of the original catalysts of vaporwave, an underground electronic music movement that covers much of the same sonic and conceptual territory."@en ;

An inside sleeve of the album dictates the following passage: \"This album is way beyond the conceived notion of how metal, or music, should be. In Essence it is a movie without pictures; a celluloid phantasmagoria. Accordingly, the film jumps, and another scene, seemingly unconnected with the previous context, is suddenly inserted in between frames. Every sound on this album is deliberate, and if you find that some parts of this album are strange, it isn't because the music is in itself strange, but because your conscious self is ill-equipped to comprehend the sounds produced on this recording.\" Hail Horror Hail was listed in the British extreme music magazine Terrorizer as the ninth best release of 1997 and made it on their top 100 list of most important albums of the nineties."@en ;

After years of success doing different comedic acts, Engvall released a CD of his material, including his most famous piece (which his debut album was named after). After peaking within the top-5 on both the Heatseekers and Hot Country Albums charts, as well as the top-50 on the Billboard 200, Engvall saw his career take off as he remains one of the most popular comedians of the past decade. The title of this album refers to a routine framework commonly used by Engvall, which begins with his stating that stupid people should have to wear warning signs that simply state \"I'm stupid.\" He'll then go on to tell several anecdotes in which someone asks an asinine question, and the question is then answered sarcastically, followed by the statement: \"Here's your sign!\" For example, a trucker gets his truck stuck under an overpass, and the responding policeman asks \"Hey, you get your truck stuck?\" The trucker answers, \"No sir, I was delivering that overpass and I ran out of gas.

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Human_Remains_(Hell_album)>	rdf:type	schema:MusicAlbum ;
	dbo:abstract	"Human Remains is the first studio album by the UK heavy metal band Hell, released on Friday 13 May 2011 by Nuclear Blast Records. The album contains re-recorded versions of songs originally performed by the band during the period 1982\u20131986, with minor arrangement changes and updates, along with the addition of new keyboard, orchestral, choral and soundscape parts added by Kev Bower. The album was pieced together over a 3-year period principally as a 'hobby project' during occasional periods of downtime at Andy Sneap's Backstage Studios, a converted 300-year-old dairy farm in Derbyshire, England. Sneap funded the entire project out of his own pocket and has been instrumental in the band's resurrection. The recordings were completed with neither hope nor aspirations of any outcome, and the original intention was to produce just a few CDR copies for the bandmembers, close friends and family. The finished product, however, reached the attention of, and subsequently attracted bids from five record labels, with the band eventually signing to Nuclear Blast Records. The album entered the national charts in Germany and several Scandinavian countries upon its release. It received countless positive reviews and a substantial number of accolades, including '2011 Album of the Year' in Sweden Rock Magazine. It also made the No. 1 position for a 2011 UK album in 'Metal Hammer' (UK), along with featuring in the top 3 of 2011 for several European journals including 'Aardschok' (NL) and 'Rock Hard' (DE). The album also achieved the '2011 Album of the Year' on a substantial number of independent websites, rock forums and similar. The album's title is a wordplay, with obvious and immediate connotations of carcasses being turned upside down with the final lyric of 'No Martyr's Cage', the album's closing track. Several tracks featured the voice of former frontman Dave Halliday, with Andy Sneap going to great lengths to lift his voice from old cassette recordings so that he could be incorporated and his memory suitably honoured. Sneap and the rest of the bandmembers also went to similar lengths (along with substantial legal and probate costs) to ensure that the album performance and compositional royalties were split six ways instead of five, with Halliday's share going to his surviving family - this process continues to this day, with Halliday's royalties continuing to be paid for live performance and radio airplay of songs to which he contributed writing credits. The album also ended up with a running time of 66 minutes and 6 seconds, and a file download size of 666MB. This was completely accidental and unintentional. The album also runs non-stop, with track gaps between the songs being filled by a series of musical interludes, introductions and soundscapes. The album's artwork, painted by Dan Goldsworthy, also received critical acclaim. Although ostensibly dark and demonic in appearance and execution, it contains a whole series of jokes, 'tips of the hat' and various other tongue-in-cheek references to moments throughout the band's history.

	dbo:abstract	"Love Is for Suckers is the fifth studio album by the heavy metal band Twisted Sister. It was strongly influenced by hair metal bands, although the band split after its release and had a lot of conflicts with this record which led to a split. According to the Live At Wacken DVD, the material was originally meant to be a solo album by Twisted Sister's lead singer, Dee Snider, but the label pushed for it to be released under the Twisted Sister name instead. Love Is For Suckers was released by Atlantic Records on August 13, 1987. The tour for the album ended in Minneapolis, Minnesota on October 10, 1987. Two days later, on October 12, 1987, vocalist Dee Snider announced his departure from the band. This would be Twisted Sister's final studio album of original material, as all albums since have been compilations or live albums (with the exception of 2004's Still Hungry which was a rerecording of 1984's Stay Hungry and A Twisted Christmas in 2006). Dee Snider has stated that he likes many of the songs on the album, vocally. However he feels that if they play any of them live, it may bring back bad memories for the band. In 2012 the band introduced \"Wake Up (The Sleeping Giant)\" into their set, following demands from fans for material to be included from all of the band's studio albums. In a 2009 interview by Ruben Mosqueda, Snider spoke of his thoughts on the album; \"There's some great stuff on there man! The thing is, that was supposed to be my first solo album. The thing was the record company and management pressured me into making it a Twisted Sister record. There's some stuff that was in the Twisted Sister vein but it was supposed to be a solo record, that album was meant to give the band the break we needed. I felt that by releasing a solo album I could put that out there, get it out my system, and then after a short break we could regroup and work on a new album. The recording, the promotion and touring of Love is for Suckers went on to kill the band. Management and the record company in their infinite wisdom know best. Oh let's put five guys who can't stand each other in a studio for three months!\" No songs from this album appeared on the band's 1992 greatest hits album Big Hits and Nasty Cuts."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Short Dog's in the House is the third studio album by Too Short on Jive Records, and his 6th studio album overall. The album was released on September 11, 1990. The CD contains a number of both socially conscious songs, as well as dirty rap and sexually-explicit songs that have made Too Short famous. The album's production samples a number of classic P-funk records, as well as the heavy use of the Roland TR-808 for instrumentation. The laid-back beats (which Shaw himself dubbed \"dope fiend beats\") would be a major influence in hip hop years later (and would help cement Too Short's legacy as a pioneer of West coast hip hop), and the album was key in the development of West Coast born G-funk that dominated the charts for the next few years. In fact, the album's cover (as well as Short's drawl-heavy delivery) was an influence for the cover art for Snoop Dogg's Doggystyle. Upon release, the album received a number of positive reviews, making it one of Too Short's more well known albums. The album featured a guest appearance by Ice Cube, and was the first time 2 major rap artists from Northern and Southern California collaborated on a song. The production of the album was handled mostly by a number of local Oakland-based producers (including Al Eaton, who was also known for his later work with Queen Latifah), but received production from two of Ice Cube's producers, Sir Jinx and DJ Pooh. The edited removes two songs and adds the song \"What Rap?\" On the edited version, \"Ain't Nothin' but a Word to Me\" was censored with bleep sound effects. Swearing is removed from others as well."@en ;

dbr:Addicted_Romantic	rdf:type	schema:MusicAlbum ;
	dbo:abstract	"Addicted Romantic is the debut studio album by Australian indie rock band Faker. Record label Capitol Records released the album on 13 June 2005. Four singles were released from the album; \"Quarter to Three\", \"The Familiar\"/\"Enough\", \"Love for Sale\", and \"Hurricane\". Of these, \"Hurricane\" was the most successful; it reached number 21 on the Triple J Hottest 100, 2005. The album spent one week on the ARIA Albums Chart at number 44, on 26 June 2005. The album was recorded by Faker with Lindsay Gravina, of Magic Dirt fame, at Melbourne's Birdland Studios. The inspiration for \"Enough\", the first song written from the album, came to lead singer Nathan Hudson from a Patti Smith song in 1997. Eight years later, the band worked with Gravina to produce \"the winning sound\" on the album. He said the biggest challenge in recording was objectivity; choosing which songs to use, as well as improving their studio recording technique. Hudson told Australian Music Online that the band wanted people to \"draw from their own experiences\" when listening to Addicted Romantic, which they hoped contained music people would relate to. The Age's Andrew Murfett said the album was influenced by Joy Division, The Cure, The Smiths, and Echo & the Bunnymen, while Guy Blackman drew comparisons to Franz Ferdinand and Bloc Party. Triple J's review of the album called it \"a dapper slice of post-mod power pop\". The Courier Mail said it featured \"love-struck schoolboy lyrics and passion\", and The Advertiser called it the best Australian album of 2005, praising \"urgent vocals and angular guitars\". Guy Blackman of The Age called the Hudson's vocals \"unashamedly accented\" but said it was \"almost refreshing to hear an Australian sing in a thick British brogue rather than the usual faux-American twang\". Following the release of Addicted Romantic, Faker toured around Australia, supporting New York band The Bravery. The concert saw them \"blow... [The Bravery] off stage\" according to The Courier Mail's Patrick Lion."@en ;

As the title implies, the album is a self made remix, but rather than solely being a remix of previous tracks in a manner similar to typical remixes, the album uses samples from previous DJ Krush tracks from all of his previous albums, including Strictly Turntablized and MiLight. Thus, the album is not a remix in the conventional sense of the terminology because it at times merely includes various samples and portions of his previous works. The album utilizes conventional, slower, rhythmic, funky break beats with jazz melodies. Many of the tracks are very dark in nature. This album maintains a certain feeling which is quite hard to replicate and which still sounds innovative even today."@en ;

Producer Glen Ballard, mostly known for producing Alanis Morissette\u2019s breakthrough album Jagged Little Pill, as well as recordings by the Dave Matthews Band, worked with Shelby on the album. Shifting from what was established by its predecessor, the album brings mostly a pop-rock oriented sound, but maintains the personal lyrics from I Am. Critically, it struggled to make an impact, receiving mostly mixed to positive reviews. As of sales, the album charted very moderately peaking at no. 109 on the Billboard 200 chart. For the second time in Lynne\u2019s career, she appears as the main songwriter, receiving credits on nine out of the ten tracks. Co-writers include Glen Ballard, Bill Payne, Sonny Landreth, Michael Landau, Matt Chamberlain and Mike Elizondo, noted for his work on Nelly Furtado\u2019s debut record Whoa, Nelly!.John Lennon also appears as a writer for his top 20 hit Mother, covered by Shelby for the album as well as during a special performance after the 9/11 attacks in New York City.

Drakengard's composers were Nobuyoshi Sano and Takayuki Aihara, Drakengard 2 was handled by Ryoki Matsumoto and Aoi Yoshiki, and Drakengard 3 was composed for by Keiichi Okabe, the composer for series spin-off Nier. Sano remained as a sound director for the second game, and his music was used as a reference for the third. Multiple albums have been released for the music of the series: Drag-On Dragoon Original Soundtrack Vol.1 and Vol.2 were released on October and November 2004, while a two-disc re-release titled Drag-On Dragoon Original Soundtrack was released in April 2011. The Drag-On Dragoon 2 Original Soundtrack was released on July 20, 2005. A promotional disc with two tracks from the soundtrack was released in the same year. The official soundtrack for the third game, Drag-On Dragoon 3 Original Soundtrack, was released January 21, 2014. An compilation of chiptune remixes of the previous games and Nier, Drag-On Dragoon Chips Music, was released on December 19, 2013 as part of the Drag-On Dragoon 10 Anniversary Box. The series has also received theme songs from multiple Japanese pop artists, all of which have been released as singles. A re-orchestration of Mika Nakashima's single \"Hitori\" was used as the theme for Drakengard 2, incorporating elements from the game. Two theme songs were written for Drakengard 3: \"Kuroi Uta\" and \"This Silence is Mine\". The former was sung by Eir Aoi, a fan of the series, and written by Nier writer Kikuchi Hana. The latter was specially written and sung by Onitsuka Chihiro, who created the song around the themes and characters of the game. Both songs were composed by Okabe. All three singles have been in the top 40 best-selling singles in the Japanese Oricon music charts. The soundtracks have received mixed to positive reviews from both dedicated video game music outlets and video game critics. The first game was noted for its disturbing style, which both drew criticism for repetitiveness and praise for suiting the game's atmosphere. It has been generally cited as an experimental soundtrack. The second game's soundtrack received a more positive reception, with the general opinion being that it was a more traditional and consequently more comfortable soundtrack. The third game's soundtrack also received fairly positive comments, mainly praising its quality, although critiques were made concerning its variety. The chiptune compilation was generally liked, except for its exclusivity to the special release. The singles have also received praise."@en ;

During the show, Smokey's wife, original Miracles member Claudette Rogers Robinson, who stopped touring with the group in 1964 (but continued recording with them), reunited with the Miracles on stage for the first time in eight years. As a celebration of the group's fifteen years together, The Miracles made this an \"all request\" show, where audience members could choose which of the group's long string of hits they wanted performed. Also, at the end of the concert, Miracles fans were introduced to the group's new lead singer, Billy Griffin. According to Smokey's autobiography, Smokey: Inside My Life, The Miracles' final concert was videotaped in movie form, but was never publicly released. However, 1957-1972 was released on CD originally in 1990, and re-released again in 2004 along with The Miracles' 1969 \"Live\" album in the 2004 Motown/Hip-O Select release Smokey Robinson and The Miracles: The Live Collection."@en ;

This album continues the increase in heaviness by the band started on their previous album Vicious Circle. The band re-branded themselves \"THE L.A. GUNS,\" at the time of the release of American Hardcore, adding the THE before its name. According to Steve Riley, this was done to note the change in direction from the band's classic Phil Lewis line-up. Also according to Riley, the band was a 5-piece and bassist Kelly Nickels was still very much part of the band during the recording of American Hardcore. Nickels even received co-writing credit on eight of the 12 tracks; but quit the band once they were dropped from PolyGram. Second guitarist Johnny Crypt then switched over to bass following Nickels' departure, and the band remained a 4-piece. The opening track F.N.A. was intended to sound like a disc skipping, and is rumored to be a portion of their cover song \"Black Sabbath\" - available on the Japanese import version of the album - simply played backwards. A hidden track can be found following an extended break at the 17 minute mark of the final track \"I am Alive.\" The track features an exchange between a couple of prison guards discussing the pending execution of an inmate. According to Van Dahl, he did all the voices in one straight take. Atomic Punks singer Ralph Saenz was recruited to replace Van Dahl after he was fired in 1997 to finish out the last couple months of the tour. The band, with Saenz, would still perform several of the songs from American Hardcore, including \"Give.\" Saenz would subsequently stay with the band to record the Wasted EP in 1998."@en ;

dbr:Changesonebowie	rdf:type	schema:MusicAlbum ;
	dbo:abstract	"Changesonebowie was David Bowie's first widely selling compilation album, issued by RCA Records in 1976. It collected songs from the 1969\u20131976 period, including the first LP appearance of \"John, I'm Only Dancing.\" A 'sax version' of this song, cut during the Aladdin Sane sessions in 1973, appeared on the first 1000 copies of the UK pressing (these can be identified by the lack of the RCA logo in the upper-right corner of the cover). Later pressings of Changesonebowie featured the original version of the single that had been recorded and released in 1972. The U.S. LP contains this original version as well. Two of the tracks, \"Ziggy Stardust\" and \"Suffragette City,\" had never been released as singles when Changesonebowie was issued, though the former had been the B-side of \"The Jean Genie\" in November 1972 and the latter would be released as an A-side in July 1976 to help promote the compilation. The cover shot was taken by Tom Kelley, who took the famous nude calendar photographs of Marilyn Monroe on red velvet in 1949.[citation needed] In 2003, the album was ranked number 425 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time. RCA released Changesonebowie on CD in 1985, but was withdrawn within a year along with the rest of the Bowie RCA catalogue, due to a conflict between Bowie and RCA. The RCA CD contains the original single version of \"John, I\u2019m Only Dancing\". Bowie's catalogue was reissued by Rykodisc beginning in 1990 and the original RCA compilation became Changesbowie on which \"Fame\" was substituted by the \"Fame 90\" Gass Mix and \"'Heroes'\", \"Ashes to Ashes\", \"Fashion\", \"Let's Dance\", \"China Girl\", \"Modern Love\", and \"Blue Jean\" were added. Due to their additional potential running time Rykodisc chose to add, in addition to the above, the songs \"Starman\" (following \"Space Oddity\"), \"Life on Mars?\" (following \"The Jean Genie\"), and \"Sound and Vision\" (following \"Golden Years\") to the cassette and double LP editions of the album."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"On the 6 is the debut studio album by American entertainer Jennifer Lopez. It was released on June 1, 1999, by the Work Group. Beginning her career in musical theater, Lopez re-entered the music scene with her portrayal of the title role in Selena (1997). The role inspired her to launch a career in music; critics deemed it risky, noting that failure would be embarrassing and could damage her career. Lopez worked with several producers on the album, including Rodney Jerkins, Cory Rooney, Dan Shea and her boyfriend at the time, rapper and record producer Sean Combs. Critics greeted Lopez's musical debut with a generally positive response. On the 6 was praised for its conservative, though dynamic, musical style and combination of Latin music with R&B and pop. Lopez's vocal performance received praise for its versatility, described as \"seductive\" and \"sultry\" by critics. Some found the album's material and vocals underwhelming, however. The album was successful on the charts, reaching the top ten in the United States and other countries (dispelling preconceptions that it could ruin her career). On the 6 went on to sell nearly three million copies in the United States (certified triple platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America) and over eight million copies worldwide. On the 6 produced five singles, most of which were commercially successful. \"If You Had My Love\" peaked at number one in the United States, while \"Waiting for Tonight\" peaked in the top ten. \"No Me Ames\", a ballad with Lopez and future husband Marc Anthony, was a hit on Billboard's Latin charts, while \"Let's Get Loud\" has become one of the entertainer's signature hits. The music video for \"If You Had My Love\" became a fixture on MTV and VH1, with \"Waiting for Tonight\" and \"Feelin' So Good\" receiving a similar response. At the time of the album's release several other Latin recording artists (including Ricky Martin and Marc Anthony) were achieving success in the mainstream music market, considered a Latin \"explosion\" and \"ethnic boom\" led by Martin and Lopez. On the 6's success allowed Lopez to evolve into an icon of pop culture in the years after its release."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Sweet 19 Blues (stylized as SWEET 19 BLUES) is the first original studio album by Japanese recording artist Namie Amuro, released July 22, 1996 by Avex Trax. All of its songs were written, arranged, composed, and produced at least in part by songwriter Tetsuya Komuro, with whom Amuro had never worked prior to Sweet 19 Blues. Having been heavily successful with the group idol group Super Monkey's, Amuro released a two-million selling album before signing with Avex Trax. Nine days after Amuro's previous album, Dance Tracks Vol.1, \"Body Feels Exit\" was released as the lead single from Sweet 19 Blues on October 25, 1995. It debuted and peaked at number three on the weekly Oricon Singles Chart and was certified Platinum. Second single \"Chase the Chance\" had even more success: it became her first single to debut at number one in Japan, and her first million-selling single. Third and fourth singles \"You're My Sunshine\" and \"Don't Wanna Cry\" were also number-one million sellers, with the final single, the title track, reaching number two and receiving a platinum certification. Critics were positive in their reviews of Sweet 19 Blues, appreciating its \"relative sophistication\" and \"brilliant\" production. The album itself proved extremely successful. Sweet 19 Blues debuted at number one on the Oricon Albums Chart, with first-week sales of 1,921,850 copies, and charted for forty-two weeks. In its original chart run, Sweet 19 Blues sold nearly 3.4 million copies, and became the second-best-selling album of 1996, behind Globe's self-titled debut album; for a brief period, it was the best-selling Japanese album of all time. Until 1999 with the release of Hikaru Utada's debut album First Love, it was the best-selling album by a female artist in Japan, and remains the sixth best-selling album by a female artist and the thirteenth best-selling album in Japan. The success of the album helped Amuro accomplish feats never realized by a solo female artist, and made her one of the most popular and successful Japanese artists of all time. Sweet 19 Blues is credited with changing the landscape of Japanese pop music, influencing everything from music style to performance, and even fashion. Some of the effects of the phenomenon caused by the album are noted to still be felt within today's Japanese music industry. Combined with the sales of its singles, Sweet 19 Blues sold over 8.5 million copies."@en ;

The Coming features rapping from Def Squad members Redman and Keith Murray as well as a guest appearance from Q-Tip and singing from Zhan\u00E9 and different future Flipmode Squad members.

It has production from many famed producers and production teams such as DJ Scratch, Easy Mo Bee and The Ummah. The Coming was a critical and commercial success for Busta Rhymes. It reached #6 on the Billboard 200 chart in 1996 and has since received a platinum certification from RIAA. Allmusic gave at a near perfect 4.5 out of 5 star rating. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic says that \"Busta Rhymes has never had such an impressive showcase for his rhymes as he does on The Coming\". It boasts the hit single \"Woo Hah!! Got You All in Check\" which reached #8 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart in 1996. It was nominated for a 1997 Grammy Award for Best Rap Solo Performance and Steve Huey of Allmusic says that the song \"catapulted Busta Rhymes into solo superstardom\". It also ended up sporting another hit single, \"It's a Party\" featuring Zhan\u00E9. The Coming has sold 793,000 copies by June 2009. The Coming, along with When Disaster Strikes... and E.L.E.

This was Sinatra's first full-length Christmas album. It features the Ralph Brewster Singers along with an orchestra conducted by Gordon Jenkins. Capitol reissued the album in 1963 with different cover art and a new title, The Sinatra Christmas Album, both of which also featured on the album's initial 1987 compact disc pressing. The original title and cover were eventually restored for subsequent CD pressings in 1990 and 1999. In 2001, the album art was altered from its 1957 version. The CD bonus tracks were originally issued on a 1954 Capitol 45 rpm single, arranged and conducted by Nelson Riddle. In 2007 the album was reissued yet again, with a \"50th Anniversary\" banner placed atop the 2001 cover art and an additional bonus track (a vintage radio PSA that Sinatra did for the American Lung Association's \"Christmas Seals\" campaign) added. In 2010, the album was reissued on vinyl for the first time since the Mobile Fidelity Sound Lab reissue, #1-135, c. 1986 (separate from the 1983 16-LP box), exclusively to independent record stores."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Amongst the Catacombs of Nephren-Ka is the debut studio album by American death metal band Nile. The album was released on April 28, 1998 through Relapse Records. The album is considered to be their breakthrough record. In contrast with the following album, Black Seeds of Vengeance, the songs are much shorter in length than the songs featured on later Nile albums. The title of the album is a reference to the H. P. Lovecraft story \"The Outsider\". The phrase is featured in the song \"Beneath Eternal Oceans of Sand\" which has lyrics paraphrased from the aforementioned tale. In Lovecraft's Cthulhu Mythos, Nephren-Ka was an Egyptian Pharaoh whose unspeakable cult worship led him to be stricken from almost all Egyptian records. The catacombs where he is buried are referenced in several Lovecraft stories as well as many stories by other mythos authors. The song \"Ramses Bringer of War\" covers the intro of Gustav Holst's Mars movement from The Planets. The title of the song \"Das rache krieg lied der Assyriche\" roughly translates as \"The Revenge War Song of the Assyrians\" in German (\"Das Rache-Kriegslied der Assyrer\"), as if it came straight from the field journal of a German archaeologist. The name of the album is used as one of achievements in Sid Meier's Civilization V video game, granted to those who beaten the game on any difficulty setting as Ramesses II."@en ;

Originally Apple Venus Volume 1 was supposed to be a double album but Partridge and Moulding were convinced to break the album up into two with the orchestral material on Apple Venus Volume 1 and the other material released on Wasp Star. The material for both albums was largely written in the aftermath of Nonsuch. While Partridge continued to write new material all of Colin Moulding's material was older songs that were submitted for earlier projects and rejected. In 2002, XTC released an instrumental version of the album entitled Instruvenus. Apple Venus Volume 1 was the last XTC album to include Dave Gregory as a member of the band.

Evans was nominated for five CMA Awards: Album of the Year; song, single, and music video (for the title-track), and Female Vocalist of the Year. She won her first CMA award for music video of the year, \"Born to Fly.\" The international version of the album includes a bonus track, \"You\", which was later released in North America as a bonus track on her 2005 album, Real Fine Place. \"Born to Fly\" was a defining album for Sara. Her earlier albums had a more traditional country sound, while all of her later albums had a more pop-friendly crossover sound, similar to Shania Twain, Faith Hill, and LeAnn Rimes, and later Carrie Underwood, Taylor Swift, and Hillary Scott of Lady Antebellum."@en ;

Also, the majority of the remixed tracks feature additional lead guitar melodies with the addition of a permanent lead guitarist to the band's line-up prior to the release of the album. In Europe, the album includes four tracks more than its predecessor; in the United States, the album has eight extra tracks, some of which had been previously released on soundtracks, such as \"Hang On,\" which had been featured on the 2003 Daredevil soundtrack and \"Out of My Way,\" which had been featured on the soundtrack to the 2003 horror film Freddy vs. Jason. \"Fine Again\" also appeared on Madden NFL 2003 and 1080\u00B0 Avalanche. A primary reason for the reworking of Disclaimer was the popularity of \"Broken.\" Originally a simple acoustic ballad, it was remade into an electric, duet version with vocals by Amy Lee. This new version was originally featured on the 2004 Punisher soundtrack and had an accompanying music video. Both the US and European releases include the new rendition of \"Broken,\" and Disclaimer II subsequently became Seether's most successful album commercially. The song \"Sold Me\" was used for WWE's Bad Blood pay per view, along with WWE also using \"Out of My Way\" as the entrance theme of Zach Gowen.

The LP was supported by a 6-week \"free tour\" using money from the band's Interscope Records contract to cover the costs, so that fans would not have to pay admission to any of the band's shows for the duration of the tour. This was an unusual move and demonstrated particular faith in the band on the part of the label, especially considering that Rocket had not yet recorded anything for Interscope (the band had negotiated an unusual clause in their contract which allowed them to record vinyl releases for other labels). Hot Charity was the second of three releases by Rocket from the Crypt in 1995. The EP The State of Art is on Fire and album Scream, Dracula, Scream! were both also recorded and released that year, and singer/guitarist John Reis would later refer to these three records as a \"trilogy\"."@en ;

The album's music was a complete departure from the progressive krautrock of the two previous albums in favor of a hard rock sound of shorter and tighter arrangements with which the band would achieve their later global success and fame; extended suites in the vein of songs such as \"Lonesome Crow\" and \"Fly to the Rainbow\" are absent altogether. It is the first album by the band to contain the now-famous logo and controversial artwork."@en ;

In the United States, the album sold around 200.000 copies. The album's four singles released include \"Our Truth\", the Depeche Mode cover of \"Enjoy the Silence\", \"Closer\", and \"Within Me\". Vocalist Cristina Scabbia confirmed that the song \"Without Fear\" is an Italian song. Music videos for all singles have been released. Karmacode has a more prominent Middle-Eastern sound compared with Lacuna Coil's previous releases. The album is considered a blend of classical and modern rock, which is notably heavier and more metallic than previous releases. Popmatters comments that the album \"doesn\u2019t take any bold steps forward, but it still shows just how good Lacuna Coil are at what they do, presented in a high-gloss, primed-for-stardom package that is bound to go over huge\". Two songs from the album have been featured in music video games: \"Closer\" in Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock and as downloadable content in Rock Band, and \"Our Truth\" in Rock Band 2 and Guitar Hero World Tour.

Huge spotlights bathed the audience of some 600,000 attendees, and as The Who's tour manager John Woolf recalls, attracted \"every moth and flying nocturnal animal on the island\". The Who started this famous concert at 2:00 A.M. By August 1970, Pete Townshend was already introducing new songs to the setlist including \"Water\", \"I Don't Even Know Myself\" and \"Naked Eye\". These songs, which were being recorded at the time of the festival, were intended for an upcoming project known as Lifehouse. Although Lifehouse was eventually abandoned, the sessions paved the way to the Who's classic album Who's Next.

The recordings for the album were originally delivered to Warner Bros. in 1977. Contractual obligations stipulated that Zappa deliver four albums for release on DiscReet Records, which eventually resulted in much of the material on L\u00E4ther being released on four separate albums: Zappa in New York (1977), Studio Tan (1978), Sleep Dirt (1979), and Orchestral Favorites (1979), only the first of which was produced with Zappa's oversight. Zappa had planned to include much of the material from these albums as a quadruple box set entitled \"L\u00E4ther\", but Warner Bros. refused to release it in this format. However, bootlegs of the original recording had existed for decades before the album's official release as a result of Frank Zappa broadcasting it over the radio in 1977 and encouraging listeners to make tape recordings of it. Gail Zappa has confirmed that the 2-track masters for the planned original album were located while producing the 1996 version. While the official CD version of L\u00E4ther released is reportedly identical to the test-pressings for the original quadruple album, four bonus tracks were added to the 1996 release and the title of the song, \"One More Time for the World\" was changed to \"The Ocean is the Ultimate Solution\", the title under which the same song appears on the album Sleep Dirt. The album does not include \"Baby Snakes\", a song which was originally planned for the album. A version of the song served as the title of the film from the same era. This is Official Release #65."@en ;

Following the dissolution of the group's \"classic\" lineup, band-leader Robert Pollard recruited Cleveland group Cobra Verde as his backing band, while retaining the Guided by Voices name. Most of Mag Earwhig! was recorded in a professional studio in Cleveland by the new lineup and marked a departure from band's trademark lo-fi sound, although additional songs were subsequently recorded in Dayton, and former members played on several tracks."@en ;
