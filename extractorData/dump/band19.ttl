	dbo:abstract	"The Big Tymers (stylized as Big Tymer$) was an American rap duo active from 1995 to 2005 from New Orleans, Louisiana. The Big Tymers consisted of Cash Money Records co-founder Birdman and former Cash Money in-house producer Mannie Fresh. Baby later changed his stage name to Birdman after the duo was dissolved. The Big Tymers released their debut album in 1997 titled How You Luv That, and a re-release version of their debut album, How You Luv That Vol. 2 which gave them an abundant amount of publicity afterwards. They recorded their first platinum-selling album in 2000 titled I Got That Work. The lead single from I Got That Work, \"Number One Stunna\" peaked at No. 24 on the Billboard Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Singles & Tracks. The group released its most successful album in 2002 titled Hood Rich. The album reached No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 200 and spawned a major hit in \"Still Fly\" which reached No. 11 on the Billboard Hot 100. Later in 2002, Mannie Fresh resigned from Cash Money Records because of financial dispute with Birdman, and his brother Slim. The group later reunited again in 2003 for their final album titled Big Money Heavyweight. During an appearance on MTV RapFix, Lil Wayne announced that there will be a Big Tymers album featuring Birdman, himself, and Drake. Birdman stated that Mannie Fresh will not be a part of the project. The project is now unlikely to happen, due to the fading relationship between Birdman and Lil Wayne."@en ;

Their lyrics tackled such varied topics as religion, the Stonewall Riots, Federico Fellini, Oklahoma, Erik Menendez, and Oscar Wilde. Based in Norman, Oklahoma, its name a reference to the band members' youth and \"chainsaw guitar sound\", the Chainsaw Kittens were active from 1989 to 2000. Debuting with a sound described 1991 SPIN review as \"The Smiths meet the New York Dolls meet the devil\", the group gained attention with \"thrift-store transvestism,\" which it abandoned when the look \"started to overshadow the music.\" The band underwent several personnel changes, but maintained the presence of principal singer/songwriter Tyson Meade, previously of Norman alt-rock outfit Defenestration, and guitarist/producer Trent Bell. Though the Kittens saw little commercial success during their period of activity, they have since won praise as \"[a]rguably the best American band who never made it\" in the '90s heyday of alternative rock. In the 1995 movie Empire Records, the character Mark, played by Ethan Embry, is wearing a \"Chainsaw Kittens\" t-shirt throughout the movie. The band reunited for a performance at the Norman Music Festival in Norman, Oklahoma on April 26, 2008."@en ;

The YC's were influenced not only by the other punk bands in town at that time such as D.O.A. and the Pointed Sticks, but also by the Dolls, the Stooges, and 1960s garage rock. Although the band only recorded two EPs and a single before breaking up, their single \"Hawaii\" is one of the classic Canadian punk anthems. Historically significant (at least to the Vancouver scene), The K-Tels were the first punk band to play the Smilin' Buddha. They also supported the Boomtown Rats on a tour across Canada. Just before the release of Hawaii, they were forced to change their name when threatened with legal action by the K-Tel corporation. The band's leader and songwriter was Art Bergmann, who went on to become one of the key figures in Canadian alternative rock in the 1980s and 1990s. Founding member and bassist Jim Bescott died in an accident in Vancouver on August 31, 2005 at the age of 52. Their two EPs and single, plus unreleased live tracks, were re-released in 1995 on the album No Escape, with liner notes written by Buck Cherry. Joyride on the Western Front, a live album documenting a 1980 concert at Mabuhay Gardens, was released in 2001."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Alter Ego is the original Peruvian neo-progressive rock band whose style goes from the ever changing art rock from the 1990s mixed with new sounds from the 1970s. Their style crosses between symphonic rock, hard rock to power ballads and R&B. The band was founded in 1992 by pianist/composer and lead singer Juan Carlos Oganes in Per\u00FA (South America), who assembled five other musicians and developed a sound that was rare for the time in that part of the world. They combined much of the anthem-type compositions of Juan Carlos Oganes with nice and lush vocal harmonies in the style of Queen and Yes. The album was produced by him and recorded at Emporium Digital Studios. Alter Ego paid much attention to theatrics and used the cinematographic expertise of Oganes -to create a sense of audiovisual entertainment. Oganes also directed their videos. They recorded much material since their first years and many of those songs ended in their 1997 debut album called Utopia. By the end of the 1990s, friction within the band led to their momentary split in 2000. Some time after, a new line up was to be formed by Oganes to play new material which was supposed to be released as an album called 'Cinema' back in 1999 before their split. A new album is scheduled to be out by the middle of this decade. Juan Carlos Oganes is also known as an actor, audiovisual producer and filmmaker having directed some short and feature films with his company Emporium Digital Studios."@en ;

Influences include 1960s garage rock bands such as The Sonics, The Standells and Shadows of Knight, The Velvet Underground, The Stooges and New York Dolls; and punk rock bands such as The Damned, The Heartbreakers and The Saints; and early hardcore punk bands such as Black Flag, Bad Brains and Dead Kennedys. \"Demons\" has often been compared to contemporary groups like New Bomb Turks, The Hellacopters and Electric Frankenstein. The band established themselves in the mid-1990s Swedish punk/garage rock scene with releases such as Electrocute and \"Demons\"... Come Bursting Out!. \"Demons\" initially gained more popularity in the United States than in their homeland, and thus much of their music has been released on American record labels, most notably Gearhead Records based in Oakland, California.

Their song \"Something's Burning\" was featured on the soundtrack to the 1997 film All Over Me, and \"Just Another Day,\" their collaboration with Pale 3, was featured on the soundtrack to the 2000 film The Princess and the Warrior. The group released a few projects under various record labels before releasing My Big Hero under Trent Reznor's Nothing Records. They were the opening act on Marilyn Manson's Mechanical Animals promo tour that ranged from September to December 1998. A follow-up album was recorded with Reznor as producer; it remains unreleased. Ross has nonetheless worked with Reznor on every Nine Inch Nails album since With Teeth as well as other projects. 12 Rounds re-obtained rights to songs from the unreleased third album and plan on releasing singles on their official website. The first song released is titled \"Shine On.\""@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Die! Die! Die! is a New Zealand noise pop/punk/post-punk band from Dunedin, formed in late 2003 and initially signed to Capital Recordings. The band has its origins in Carriage H, a Dunedin high school band which was formed in 1999 and made the finals of the 2000 Pepsismokefree Rockquest. Band members were Andrew Wilson (bass)Tiddy Smith (guitar, vocals), and Michael Prain (drums). Carriage H released one EP, Power of Grey Skull in 2002 and disbanded shortly afterwards. Wilson and Prain then formed Die! Die! Die! Their self-titled album Die! Die! Die! was released in 2005 in New Zealand, with an international release soon after. It was recorded in Chicago's Electrical Audio by Steve Albini. 2006 saw the release of the four-track EP Locust Weeks. This EP was included in the British release of the album, released by Pet Piranha Records. The band's second album, Promises, Promises was released in New Zealand in October 2007, and worldwide shortly after. Produced by Shayne Carter (Straitjacket Fits, Dimmer), the album saw the band move away from the more hardcore tendencies of their first record towards a more bass- and drum-heavy sound, helped in part by new bassist Lachlan Anderson. After touring relentlessly for almost three years worldwide, the band completed their third album Form in August 2009, which was released on Flying Nun Records in July 2010. Form debuted at number 1 on the independent charts and number 19 on the National Album charts. Produced by Nick Roughan of Skeptics, the album garnered critical acclaim (including Roughan and the band winning Producer in the 2011 New Zealand Music Awards and a nomination the same year for Best Alternative Album. The album saw the band move further towards the sound they began on Promises, Promises. The band's fourth album, Harmony, recorded in late 2010, was released in August 2012. It was also shortlisted for the 2011 Taite Music Prize. All the band's releases prior to Form are available on American Label SAF Records. Die! Die! Die! have toured with Franz Ferdinand, Slint, The Brian Jonestown Massacre, Wolfmother and The Blood Brothers, and have played several major festivals around the world including spots at SXSW and Incubate."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Farmer Boys is a heavy metal band from Stuttgart, Germany. They reached their peak of popularity with their album The World Is Ours, released in 2000; the videos for singles \"Here Comes The Pain\" and \"If You Ever Leave Me Standing\" were put into heavy rotation by German alternative music channels such as VIVA Zwei. Farmer Boys has obtained a cult following in later years. Their musical style is a blend of Machine Head's groove metal and Paradise Lost's gothic metal; their lyrical matter, however, unusually to the style, often revolves around the darker side of agriculture - bestiality (\"Farm Sweet Farm\"), torture of animals (\"When a Chicken Cries For Love\"), suicide (\"Relieve the Tension)\" and slaughterhouses (\"When Pigs Fly\"). Their later albums have strayed away from the subject matter. Matthias Sayer also provided guest vocals for Apocalyptica's single Hope Vol.2. As of June 2007, very little news regarding the band has been forthcoming since the release of The Other Side in 2004. There are concerns amongst the fans that the band has split up, however there has been no formal press release regarding this. In 2008 after four years had passed since the release of The Other Side the group performed a reunion concert in Stuttgart on 22 December. Having been silent since 2008, however, in 2011 the band played a concert at Summer Breeze Open Air, on 20 August in Dinkelsb\u00FChl, Germany. No official statement was made concerning about new possible studio album or the future of the band."@en ;

They played their last show under the former name with Lost Valentinos at the Sydney Club The Annandale on 18 May 2007. Ghostwood's first release is their eponymous EP, with tracks Red Version, Blue Version, Ghost, Run and Pencils. The single Red Version was iTunes single of the week in late August 2007. Some say that all the songs on the EP are about Pok\u00E9mon, as emphasised by the titles, all of which except Pencils reference the video game series. Gabby (Vocalist and songwriter for the band) has stated in an interview that the song Red Version is about the Pok\u00E9mon Trading Card Game, but Blue Version is not. Throughout 2011 Ghostwood have had high rotation Radio play on Australia's triple j with new songs \" Sunset Mirage\" & \" Cutlass\", the first of new tracks to be released along with the 3rd & EP titled track \" I am Overcast\" in June 2011."@en ;

Say! refers to the fact that all the members were born in the Heisei period, and JUMP is an acronym for Johnny's Ultra Music Power. Like agency seniors Hikaru Genji and V6, the group is split into two sub-groups: Hey! Say! BEST (Boys Excellent Select Team) and Hey! Say! 7 (not to be confused with the temporary group of the same name), which consists of the five oldest members (BEST) and four youngest members (7) respectively. The average age of the unit at the debut was 15, with the youngest member being 13 and the oldest 17. Also, with having Keito Okamoto as a member of the group (who is the son of Otokogumi's Kenichi Okamoto), with this group there is the first parent-child pair in Johnny & Associates. They have sold over 2,386,402 copies in Japan alone. The group debuted in 2007 with ten members. In 2011, Ryutaro Morimoto was indefinitely suspended from the group following an underage smoking scandal. This caused the band to go from ten members to nine."@en ;

The song \"Seven Days of Lonely\" was put iTunes as the service's \"free single of the week\" from February 19, 2008 - February 25, 2008. In the April 5, 2008 issue of Billboard, I Nine's second single \"If This Room Could Move,\" which was produced by Nickelback's Chad Kroeger, received a spotlight review by editor Chuck Taylor: \"I Nine catapulted out of native South Carolina when Cameron Crowe invited the quartet to appear on the motion pic soundtrack for his Elizabethtown. At year-end 2007, it grazed the adult top 40 top 25 with \"Seven Days of Lonely,\" the debut from upcoming CD Heavy Weighs the King \u2014 but that pep pill was a mere taste of the group\u2019s prowess. Sunny follow-up \"If This Room Could Move\" is garnering hype because Chad Kroeger produced \u2014 all well and good but bragging rights are earned on its own merits: an ambrosial vocal from Carmen Keigans, divine start-and-stop tempo, and instrumental elements that blend \u201890s jangle-rock with Brit pop. On record, they sound like a blissful union of Jewel and Sixpence None the Richer \u2014 if more Avril Lavigne live. With two exquisite singles in a row, I Nine is counting down to name-brand status.

The lyrics on their first album, Resolution 194, dealt with the Palestinian refugees' cause and the effects on Palestinian society after Nakba. After several live performances, the band started to deviate from hip hop to a style which combined big beat and dance instrumentals with varied lyrical elements. Jaffa Phonix first emerged from the underground hip/hop scene in Egypt, and garnered mainstream recognition after a track from their first album, \"Osti\" (My Story), was played on the Egypt's biggest radio station, Nile FM.

KYPCK's live performances have been distinctive from the very beginning, including Soviet Era video projections and peculiar instruments like bassist Yl\u00E4-Rautio's 1-stringed bass Kypcklop, and guitarist Lopakka's 6-stringer, built by Amfisound Guitars, around a genuine Kalashnikov AK-47 assault rifle. KYPCK have created their own genre Doomsday Metal and broken numerous barriers on their way: The first album sang entirely in the Russian language to have been released worldwide. The lengthiest Russian tour ever by a Western band - from St. Petersburg to Siberia's Irkutsk. Songs on the playlist of Russia's biggest rock radio station, who have strictly ruled out including non-Russian bands in their playlist rotation. In 2015, the band was banned from entering Belarus.

Nightwish is Finland's most successful band with more than 7 million sold albums worldwide, 1 silver award, 11 gold awards and 30 platinum awards. Although Nightwish has been prominent in their home country since the release of their first single, \u201CThe Carpenter\u201D (1997) and debut album Angels Fall First, they did not achieve worldwide fame until the release of the albums Oceanborn, Wishmaster and Century Child, which were released in 1998, 2000 and 2002 respectively. Their 2004 album, Once, which has sold more than 1.2 million copies, led to Nightwish video clips being shown on MTV in the United States and inclusion of their music in US movie soundtracks. Their biggest US hit single, \u201CWish I Had an Angel\u201D (2004), made it onto three US film soundtracks as a means to promote their North American tour. The band produced three more singles and two music videos for the album, as well as \u201CSleeping Sun\u201D, from the 2005 \u201Cbest of\u201D compilation album, Highest Hopes, prior to vocalist Tarja Turunen\u2019s dismissal. In May 2007, former Alyson Avenue frontwoman, Anette Olzon, was revealed as Turunen\u2019s replacement, and in the autumn, the band released a new album \u2013 Dark Passion Play, which has sold more than 1.5 million copies. The supporting tour started on October 6, 2007 and ended on September 19, 2009. A new E.P./live album, Made in Hong Kong (And in Various Other Places), was released in March 2009 as a MCD/DVD.

An EP entitled Middle of the Night was released in 2013, which was led by the single \"Every Time I Touch You\". In 2014 Cyrus returned to the band and a new single entitled \"Love & War\" was released. In 2015, the band released a second full-length album titled Savior.

Achieving both critical acclaim and commercial success in the mid-late 1990s and early 2000s, the duo helped popularize Southern hip hop styles while developing distinctive personas and an idiosyncratic sound that incorporated genres such as funk, psychedelia, techno, and gospel. Benjamin and Patton formed the group as high school students in 1992. OutKast released their debut album Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik in 1994, which gained popularity after the single \"Player's Ball\", reached number one on the Billboard Hot Rap Tracks chart. With successive releases including ATLiens (1996) and Aquemini (1998), the duo further developed their sound, experimenting with a variety of styles and achieving commercial success. In 2000, Outkast released the critically acclaimed Stankonia, which included the singles \"Ms. Jackson\" and \"B.O.B.\". In 2003, the duo released the double album Speakerboxxx/The Love Below, which featured the number one singles \"Hey Ya!\" and \"The Way You Move\" and would eventually win the Grammy Award for Album of the Year. Outkast next released the soundtrack for the 2006 musical film Idlewild, which they also starred in. In 2007, the duo went on hiatus and both members have since pursued solo careers. In 2014, Outkast reunited to celebrate their 20th anniversary by performing at more than 40 festivals worldwide in 2014, beginning at the Coachella Festival in April. The duo is one of the most successful hip-hop groups of all time, having received six Grammy Awards. Between six studio albums and a greatest hits release, Outkast has sold over 25 million records. Meanwhile, they have garnered widespread critical acclaim, with publications such as Rolling Stone and Pitchfork Media listing albums such as Aquemini and Stankonia among the best of their era."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"AC/DC are an Australian rock band, formed in 1973 by brothers Malcolm and Angus Young. A hard rock/blues rock band, they have also been considered a heavy metal band, although they have always dubbed their music simply \"rock and roll\". AC/DC underwent several line-up changes before releasing their first album, High Voltage, in 1975; Malcolm and Angus were the only original members left in the band. Membership subsequently stabilised until bassist Mark Evans was replaced by Cliff Williams in 1977 for the album Powerage. Within months of recording the album Highway to Hell, lead singer and co-songwriter Bon Scott died on 19 February 1980 after a night of heavy alcohol consumption. The group considered disbanding, but buoyed by support from Scott's parents, decided to continue and set about finding a new vocalist. Ex-Geordie singer Brian Johnson was auditioned and selected to replace Scott. Later that year, the band released the new album, Back in Black, which was made as a tribute to Bon Scott. The album launched them to new heights of success and became their all-time best-seller. The band's next album, For Those About to Rock We Salute You, was their first album to reach number one in the United States. Drummer Phil Rudd was fired in 1983 and replaced by ex-A II Z drummer Simon Wright, who left to join Dio in 1989. The band experienced a resurgence in the early 1990s with the release of The Razors Edge. Phil Rudd returned in 1994 after Chris Slade, who was with the band from 1989 to 1994, was asked to leave in favour of him, and contributed to the band's 1995 album Ballbreaker. Stiff Upper Lip, released in 2000, was well received by critics. The band's studio album, Black Ice, released in 2008, was the second-highest-selling album of that year, and their biggest chart hit since For Those About to Rock, eventually reaching No.1 on all charts worldwide. The band's line-up remained the same until 2014 with Malcolm Young's retirement and Rudd's legal troubles. In 2016, Johnson was advised to stop touring on account of worsening hearing loss and Guns N' Roses frontman Axl Rose stepped in as the band's vocalist for the remainder of that year's dates. Long-term bass player Cliff Williams subsequently indicated that he would retire from the band on the completion of their current world tour. AC/DC have sold more than 200 million records worldwide, including 71.5 million albums in the United States alone, adding them to the List of highest-certified music artists in the United States and the List of best-selling music artists. Back in Black has sold an estimated 50 million units worldwide, making it the fifth-highest-selling album by any artist \u2013 and the third-highest-selling album by any band. The album has sold 22 million units in the US alone, where it is the sixth-highest-selling album of all time. AC/DC ranked fourth on VH1's list of the \"100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock\" and were named the seventh \"Greatest Heavy Metal Band of All Time\" by MTV. In 2004, AC/DC ranked No. 72 on the Rolling Stone list of the \"100 Greatest Artists of All Time\". Producer Rick Rubin, who wrote an essay on the band for the Rolling Stone list, referred to AC/DC as \"the greatest rock and roll band of all time.\" In 2010, AC/DC were ranked number 23 in the VH1 list of the \"100 Greatest Artists of All Time\"."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Alter Bridge is an American rock band from Orlando, Florida, formed in 2004. Since their formation in 2004, the band has consisted of lead vocalist and guitarist Myles Kennedy, lead guitarist and backing vocalist Mark Tremonti, bassist Brian Marshall, and drummer Scott Phillips. The band is known for its acclaimed live shows and extensive touring. Following Creed's disbandment in 2004, former members Tremonti, Marshall, and Phillips began working with Kennedy, formerly of The Mayfield Four. Named after a bridge that once existed on Alter Road near Tremonti's former home in Detroit, Michigan, Alter Bridge released its debut album, One Day Remains, the same year. Despite mixed reviews, One Day Remains went on to be certified Gold by the RIAA. Driven by the release of the single \"Rise Today\", the band released its second album, Blackbird, to more positive reviews in 2007, embarking on a successful world tour in support. The album marked the beginning of a longtime collaboration with producer Michael Baskette, who has produced every Alter Bridge album since. Tremonti, Marshall, and Phillips reunited with Creed for a tour and album in 2009, while Kennedy recorded two songs for guitarist Slash's self-titled solo album in 2010, before fronting his band for a supporting tour. During this time, Alter Bridge continued to write material, and released its third album, AB III, in 2010 to critical acclaim, while the single \"Isolation\" became the band's most successful single to date. The band embarked on a world tour in support of AB III from 2010 to 2012. Following the conclusion of the AB III tour, the members of Alter Bridge focused on other musical endeavors throughout 2012, including solo and session work, another Creed tour, and Kennedy's continued collaborations with Slash. Alter Bridge reconvened in early 2013 and released its fourth album, Fortress, to further acclaim later that year, also embarking on a world tour, lasting until November 2014.

Led by Andrea Echeverri and H\u00E9ctor Buitrago, they have been one of the first rock bands from Colombia to gain international notice and they are among the country's top groups. Their music fuses rock with a variety of Colombian and Latin American musical traditions. Time magazine wrote that \"Aterciopelados's true skill lies in its ability to take north-of-the-border musical styles\u2026and breathe new life into them, all while giving them a distinctly Colombian sheen.\" Additionally, Aterciopelados engages audiences all over the world with their socially conscious message. Honored by the United Nations for their work denouncing violence in Colombia, Aterciopelados speaks out about myriad issues including political injustice, women's rights, and environmental destruction. The group has also received numerous awards, such as the Latin Grammy Award for Best Alternative Album in 2007, for Oye (Nacional Records). Their song Bolero Falaz topped a list of the 1000 most important songs of Colombian rock and other songs of theirs such as Maligno, El Estuche, Mujer Gala and Sortilegio ranked high in the list by Canal Viva Colombia. In October 2008, Aterciopelados released a new studio album, Rio, on Nacional Records. The album received rave reviews from publications like Rolling Stone, the Washington Post, Billboard, and from NPR's All Things Considered. As Vibe Magazine said, \"For Aterciopelados, maturity has become a form of liberation.\" The group toured United States in April 2009 to support Rio."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Billy Talent is a Canadian rock band from Mississauga, Ontario. They formed in 1993 with Benjamin Kowalewicz as the lead vocalist, Ian D'Sa on guitar, bassist Jon Gallant and drummer Aaron Solowoniuk. There have been no lineup changes, although Aaron is currently taking a hiatus from the band due to an MS relapse, Jordan Hastings from Alexisonfire, Cunter and Say Yes is currently filling in for him. In the 13 years since their inception, Billy Talent sold well over one million albums in Canada alone and nearly 3 million albums internationally. The band existed for almost a decade before mainstream success. The members met and played in Our Lady of Mount Carmel Secondary School under the name Pezz and remained underground in Toronto's indie music scene until 2001. The band renamed itself Billy Talent after running into legal trouble with the old name. It was then that Kowalewicz's connection with an employee of Warner Music Canada's A&R department landed the band a record deal and launched them into mainstream success. Since then, Billy Talent has made three multi-platinum records in Canada, and continues to expand their success overseas, this included touring for 20 months supporting their second album. They released their third album, entitled Billy Talent III, on July 14, 2009, and their fourth album, entitled Dead Silence, on September 4, 2012. Dead Silence was followed up by a full UK tour over the course of October and November 2012. To commemorate the longevity since the release of their first studio album, the band has released a greatest hits album entitled Hits on November 4, 2014. the band regrouped and began to prepare material for its fifth studio album. Just prior to entering the studio, drummer Aaron Solowoniuk made the difficult decision to sit out the recording sessions while he continued his longstanding battle with multiple sclerosis. Fellow Canadian Jordan Hastings quickly recruited to play as Solowoniuk's studio stand-in, and in early 2016 the group completed work on Afraid of Heights, which was released that July."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Broken Social Scene is a Canadian indie rock band, a musical collective including as few as six and as many as nineteen members, formed in 1999 by Kevin Drew and Brendan Canning. Most of its members currently play in various other groups and solo projects, mainly in the city of Toronto. The band refuses the label \"supergroup\", based on size or the ubiquity of their members, claiming that in the indie scene everyone is involved in more than one project. The group's sound could be considered a combination of all of its members' respective musical projects, and is occasionally considered baroque pop. It is characterized by a very large number of sounds, grand orchestrations featuring guitars, horns, woodwinds, and violins, unusual song structures, and an experimental, and sometimes chaotic production style from David Newfeld, who produced the second and third albums. In 2009, Stuart Berman's This Book Is Broken, which details the band from its inception to its critical acclaim, was published. In 2010, Bruce McDonald made This Movie Is Broken, a movie about the band's Harbourfront show during the 2009 Toronto strike."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Camper Van Beethoven is an American rock band formed in Redlands, California in 1983 and later located in Santa Cruz and San Francisco. Their style mixes elements of pop, ska, punk rock, folk, alternative country, and world music. The band initially polarized audiences within the hardcore punk scene of California's Inland Empire before finding wider acceptance and, eventually, an international audience. Their strong iconoclasm and emphasis on do-it-yourself values proved influential to the burgeoning indie rock movement. The band's first three independent records were released within an 18-month period. Their debut single was \"Take the Skinheads Bowling\". The group signed to Virgin Records in 1987, released two albums and enjoyed chart success with their 1989 cover of Status Quo's \"Pictures of Matchstick Men\", a number one hit on Billboard Magazine's Modern Rock Tracks. They disbanded the following year due to internal tensions. Lead singer David Lowery formed Cracker, David Immergl\u00FCck joined Counting Crows, and several other members played in Monks of Doom. Beginning in 1999, the former members reunited and made several new records."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Cast are an English rock band from Liverpool, formed in 1992 by John Power (vocals, guitar) and Peter Wilkinson (backing vocals, bass) after Power left The La's and Wilkinson's former band Shack had split. Following early line-ups with different guitarists and drummers, Liam \"Skin\" Tyson (guitar) and Keith O'Neill (drums) joined Cast in 1993. Emerging from the Britpop movement of the mid-1990s, Cast signed to Polydor Records and their debut album All Change (1995) became the highest selling debut album for the label. Further commercial success continued with the albums Mother Nature Calls (1997) and Magic Hour (1999), however a departure in sound on the band's fourth album Beetroot (2001) was met by a poor critical and commercial reaction and led to the band's split two weeks after its release. The band reformed in November 2010 and released their fifth album Troubled Times in November 2011. Bassist Peter Wilkinson confirmed his departure from the band in March 2015, following his abrupt departure from a previous tour in December 2014. Noel Gallagher of Oasis described watching the band live as being like a \"religious experience\" and they were labelled \"The Who of the 90's\". It has been suggested that the name \"Cast\" was taken from the final word on The La's eponymous album (the song \"Looking Glass\" ends with the repeated line \"The change is cast\"); John Power has since confirmed this to be true, stating that he avoided answering this question for some time."@en ;

The self-described \"rock and roll band with horns\" began as a politically charged, sometimes experimental, rock band and later moved to a predominantly softer sound, generating several hit ballads. The group had a steady stream of hits throughout the 1970s and 1980s. Second only to The Beach Boys in Billboard singles and albums chart success among American bands, Chicago is one of the longest-running and most successful rock groups, and one of the world's best-selling groups of all time, having sold more than 100 million records. According to Billboard, Chicago was the leading US singles charting group during the 1970s. They have sold over 40 million units in the US, with 23 gold, 18 platinum, and 8 multi-platinum albums. Over the course of their career they have had five number-one albums and 21 top-ten singles. They were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame on April 8, 2016 at Barclays Center in Brooklyn, New York."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Coldplay are a British rock band formed in 1996 by lead vocalist and pianist Chris Martin and lead guitarist Jonny Buckland at University College London (UCL). After they formed under the name Pectoralz, Guy Berryman joined the group as a bassist and they changed their name to Starfish. Will Champion joined as a drummer and backing vocalist, completing the performing line-up. Creative Director Phil Harvey is often referred to as the official fifth member by the band. The band renamed themselves \"Coldplay\" in 1998, before recording and releasing three EPs: Safety in 1998, Brothers & Sisters as a single in 1999, and The Blue Room in the same year. The Blue Room was their first release on a major label, after signing to Parlophone. They achieved worldwide fame with the release of the single \"Yellow\" in 2000. This was followed by their debut album Parachutes released the same year, which was nominated for the Mercury Prize. The band's second album, A Rush of Blood to the Head (2002), was released to critical acclaim and won multiple awards, including NME's Album of the Year. Their next release, X&Y, the best-selling album worldwide in 2005, was met with mostly positive reviews upon its release, though some critics felt that it was inferior to its predecessor. The band's fourth studio album, Viva la Vida or Death and All His Friends (2008), was produced by Brian Eno and released again to largely positive reviews, earning several Grammy Award nominations and wins at the 51st Grammy Awards. On 24 October 2011, they released their fifth studio album, Mylo Xyloto, which received mixed to positive reviews, topped the charts in over 34 countries, and was the UK's best-selling rock album of 2011. On 16 May 2014, they released their sixth album, titled Ghost Stories, which also received mixed to positive reviews and topped the iTunes Store albums charts in over 100 countries. On 4 December 2015, the band released their seventh album, A Head Full of Dreams, which reached the top two in most major markets, but received generally mixed reviews. The band has won 62 awards from 209 nominations throughout their career, including nine Brit Awards\u2014winning Best British Group four times\u2014five MTV Video Music Awards and seven Grammy Awards from 31 nominations. Coldplay have sold more than 80 million records worldwide, making them one of the world's best-selling music artists. In December 2009, Rolling Stone readers voted the group the fourth-best artist of the 2000s. Coldplay have been an active supporter of various social and political causes, such as Oxfam's Make Trade Fair campaign and Amnesty International. The group have also performed at various charity projects such as Band Aid 20, Live 8, Sound Relief, Hope for Haiti Now: A Global Benefit for Earthquake Relief, The Secret Policeman's Ball, Sport Relief and the UK's Teenage Cancer Trust."@en ;

Signed to Avex Trax, the band released their debut single \"Tangerine Dream\" on September 29, 1999, followed by three more singles between 1999 and 2000, which appeared on their debut album Break of Dawn (2000). In December 2000, Nagao decided to devote all his time to composing the music and no longer appeared at live events. Five more studio albums were released between 2001 with New World and 2005 with Need Your Love. With the release of their A-side singles compilation album Do the A-side (2005), Do As Infinity disbanded on September 29, 2005. The members continued work in the music industry, with Van pursuing a solo career, Owatari working with his band Missile Innovation formed in 2004, and Nagao continuing to work with other artists at Avex Trax. The band reformed on September 29, 2008, but Nagao did not return.

Since 1979, they have hosted the Cropredy Festival, which is the largest such annual event in England.

As the 1990s progressed, the band remained very popular in Asia, mainly in countries like Japan, Thailand, India, Malaysia, Philippines, Indonesia, and Singapore. They also maintained popularity in South America and Europe. FireHouse continued to release new material throughout the late 1990s and into the early 2000s, most of which has successfully charted in Japan. The band has also continued to tour internationally as of 2007, having participated twice in the annual Rock Never Stops Tour with other bands of the 1980s. FireHouse is estimated to have sold over 7 million albums worldwide since their debut. Originally composed of vocalist C. J. Snare, guitarist Bill Leverty, drummer Michael Foster, and bassist Perry Richardson, the band has maintained its original members with the exception of Richardson, who departed in 2000.

	dbo:abstract	"Foo Fighters is an American rock band, formed in Seattle, Washington in 1994. It was founded by Nirvana drummer Dave Grohl as a one-man project following the death of Kurt Cobain and the resulting dissolution of his previous band. The group got its name from the UFOs and various aerial phenomena that were reported by Allied aircraft pilots in World War II, which were known collectively as foo fighters. Prior to the release of Foo Fighters' 1995 debut album Foo Fighters, which featured Grohl as the only official member, Grohl recruited bassist Nate Mendel and drummer William Goldsmith, both formerly of Sunny Day Real Estate, as well as Nirvana touring guitarist Pat Smear to complete the lineup. The band began with performances in Portland, Oregon. Goldsmith quit during the recording of the group's second album, The Colour and the Shape (1997), when most of the drum parts were re-recorded by Grohl himself. Smear's departure followed soon afterward, though he would rejoin them in 2005. They were replaced by Taylor Hawkins and Franz Stahl, respectively, although Stahl was fired before the recording of the group's third album, There Is Nothing Left to Lose (1999). The band briefly continued as a trio until Chris Shiflett joined as the band's lead guitarist after the completion of There Is Nothing Left to Lose. The band released its fourth album, One by One, in 2002. The group followed that release with the two-disc In Your Honor (2005), which was split between acoustic songs and heavier material. Foo Fighters released its sixth album, Echoes, Silence, Patience & Grace, in 2007. The band's seventh studio album, Wasting Light, produced by Butch Vig was released in 2011, in which Smear returned as a full member. In November 2014, the band's eighth studio album, Sonic Highways, was released as an accompanying soundtrack to the Grohl-directed 2014 miniseries of the same name. Over the course of the band's career, four of its albums have won Grammy Awards for Best Rock Album. As of 2015, the band's eight albums have sold 12 million copies in the U.S., and 30 million worldwide."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Girls' Generation (Hangul: \uC18C\uB140\uC2DC\uB300; RR: Sonyeo Sidae), also known as SNSD, is a South Korean girl group formed by S.M. Entertainment. The group is composed of eight members: Taeyeon, Sunny, Tiffany, Hyoyeon, Yuri, Sooyoung, Yoona, and Seohyun. Originally a nine-piece group (with Jessica, who later departed from the group in September 2014), Girls' Generation debuted in 2007 with their Korean eponymous debut album. Though the album gained some attention, it was not until 2009 that the group rose to fame with the single \"Gee\", which claimed the top spot on KBS's Music Bank for a record-breaking nine consecutive weeks and was named the most popular song of the 2000s in South Korea by Melon. Girls' Generation further consolidated their popularity on the South Korean music scene with follow-up singles \"Tell Me Your Wish (Genie)\", \"Oh!\", and \"Run Devil Run\", which were released in mid-2009 and early 2010. In mid-2010, Girls' Generation signed with Nayutawave Records (present-day EMI Records Japan) to venture into the Japanese music scene. Their June 2011 self-titled Japanese debut album peaked atop the Japanese Oricon Albums Chart and became the first album by a non-Japanese girl group to be certified million by the Recording Industry Association of Japan. The group's third Korean studio album The Boys was released in October 2011 and became the best-selling album of 2011 in South Korea with sales of over 380,000 copies. An English version of the single \"The Boys\" was released by Interscope Records in an attempt to expand the group's endeavor to the global music scene. The group's 2013 fourth Korean studio album I Got a Boy was supported by the single \"I Got a Boy\", which was subjected to major attention from Western media following its winning the Video of the Year award at the inaugural YouTube Music Awards. Their fifth Korean studio album, Lion Heart, was released in 2015. Girls' Generation's signature musical styles are characterized as electropop and bubblegum pop, though their sounds have varied widely, incorporating various genres including hip hop, R&B, and EDM. They have sold over 4.4 million albums and 30 million digital singles as of 2012. The group's immense popularity in their native country South Korea has earned them numerous accolades and the titles \"The Nation's Singers\" and \"The Nation's Girl Group\". Girls' Generation is also deemed one of the prominent figures of the Korean Wave and one of the most popular K-pop acts internationally. They are the first girl group to achieve four music videos with over 100 million views on YouTube: \"Gee\", \"I Got a Boy\", \"The Boys\", and \"Mr. Taxi\". In Japan, they became the first non-Japanese girl group to have three number-one albums on the Japanese Oricon Albums Chart, and their three Japanese concert tours attracted a record-breaking 550,000 spectators, more than any other Korean girl groups."@en ;

Though early on categorized as a trip hop group, they quickly expanded their sound to the point where they could no longer be described as a lone genre, but rather encompass alternative, electronica, electropop, rock, and mixture of others. The band originally called themselves Hoover, but later changed their name to Hooverphonic after discovering other groups were already using the Hoover name and to avoid any legal issues with the vacuum cleaner company. On 10 October 2008, Geike Arnaert, the lead singer of the band, announced she would leave the group by the end of the year to pursue her solo career. Arnaert had been working on solo material for a few months. The last concert of Hooverphonic with Geike was on 13 December 2008 in Tele-Club, Ekaterinburg, Russia. It was filmed by the local MTV station and was shown on Russian TV in 2009. On 29 October 2010, Hooverphonic announced their new single on their website. The videoclip showcased fourteen possible singers but only one of them, No\u00E9mie Wolfs, proved to be the real successor of Geike Arnaert. On 4 November 2010, the new singer was announced on De Laatste Show at the VRT, the Flemish public broadcasting organization. On 26 March 2015 Hooverphonic announced that No\u00E9mie Wolfs would be leaving the band \"in mutual agreement\"."@en ;

Initially known in Australia for their pub rock style, they later achieved mainstream success playing new wave and synthpop music and attained Top 10 singles chart success in both Europe and the U.S. The mainstay of both Flowers and Icehouse has been Iva Davies (singer-songwriter, record producer, guitar, bass, keyboards, oboe) supplying additional musicians as required. The name Icehouse, which was adopted in 1981, comes from an old, cold flat Davies lived in and the strange building across the road populated by itinerant people. Davies and Icehouse extended the use of synthesizers particularly the Sequential Circuits Prophet-5 (\"Love in Motion\", 1981), Linn drum machine (\"Hey Little Girl\", 1982) and Fairlight CMI (Razorback trailer, 1983) in Australian popular music. Their best known singles on the Australian charts were \"Great Southern Land\", \"Hey Little Girl\", \"Crazy\", \"Electric Blue\" and \"My Obsession\"; with Top Three albums being Icehouse (1980, as Flowers), Primitive Man (1982) and Man of Colours (1987). Icehouse's iconic status was acknowledged when they were inducted into the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) Hall of Fame on 16 August 2006. ARIA described Icehouse as \"one of the most successful Australian bands of the eighties and nineties... With an uncompromising approach to music production they created songs that ranged from pure pop escapism to edgy, lavish synthesised pieces...\" Icehouse has produced eight Top Ten albums and twenty Top Forty singles in Australia, multiple top ten hits in Europe and North America and album sales of over 28 times Platinum in Australasia alone. As of 2006, Man of Colours was still the highest selling album in Australia by an Australian band."@en ;

Along with the bands At the Gates and Dark Tranquillity, In Flames was originally a metal band responsible for developing the genre now known as melodic death metal. During the band's early years, the band had a varying group of musicians recording with the band, including many session musicians. By the release of Colony (1999) the group had established a stable lineup. Their sixth studio album Reroute To Remain (2002) showed the band moving toward a newer style of music that moved further away from melodic death metal and closer to alternative metal. This decision was criticized by fans of the group's heavier metal sound; however, it increased the band's mainstream audience and bolstered their album sales. As of 2008, In Flames had sold over 2 million records worldwide. Since the band's inception, In Flames have released eleven studio albums, three EPs, and two live DVDs, their latest release being their eleventh studio album Siren Charms in 2014. In Flames has been nominated for three Grammis Awards. They won two of these nominations; one for Soundtrack to Your Escape (2004) in the \"Hard Rock/Metal of the Year\" category, and one nomination for their following album Come Clarity (2006) in the same category."@en ;

The band originally consisted of songwriter, vocalist and lead guitarist, Goher Mumtaz and vocalist, Atif Aslam and later joined by bass guitarist Omer Nadeem. Founded in 2002, they first became popular playing in Lahore's underground music scene with the release of their song \"Aadat\". The band initially achieved commercial success with the release of their music video \"Aadat\", directed by Umer Anwar, in 2003. After the success of the single, lead vocalist Atif Aslam parted ways with the band, due to differences with lead guitarist Goher Mumtaz, to pursue a career as a solo artist. This led to Mumtaz recruiting musicians Farhan Saeed on vocals and Aamir Sheraz on bass guitar. The band's new line-up followed with the release of their d\u00E9but studio album, Aadat, in 2004. The album was declared as the best selling album of 2004 on Geo TV by the record label Sadaf Stereo. Soon afterwards, the band recorded and released their second studio album Boondh in 2007, which topped several music charts in South Asia. The band went on to win the MTV Asia Award for Favorite Artist India in 2006. In 2011, Farhan Saeed also left the band to pursue a solo career, with Goher Mumtaz taking over as the lead vocalist of the band. Jal came out with their third studio album 'Pyaas' which was released to the fans delight on 11 March 2013 in both Pakistan (by Hum Network, M Records) and India (Universal Music). But even after that, On 23 December 2013, Aamir Sheraz officially left the band. Jal performed songs from their album Pyaas, apart from their old hits, in London's O2 Arena in June 2013."@en ;

Much of the band's recent material, however, sees a heavier and more down-tuned style, featuring a more distinct bass line and a higher mixing of the guitars within the songs. The band's 2012 release, Dark Adrenaline, peaked at number 15 on the Billboard 200. They have toured internationally and were nominated for a MTV Music Award."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Lemon Jelly is a British electronic music duo from London, formed in 1998. Since their inception, the band's line-up has included Fred Deakin and Nick Franglen. Lemon Jelly has been nominated for the Mercury Music Prize and BRIT Awards. Deakin and Franglen briefly met in North London as teenagers and became friends before going their separate ways. Deakin became a DJ and co-founded his very own Airside studios and Franglen became a studio programmer, before the two became reacquainted in 1998. Lemon Jelly released three critically acclaimed EPs in 1998, 1999, and 2000, which secured them a record deal with XL Recordings in 2000. The band subsequently released three full-length albums before going on hiatus in 2008."@en ;
