	dbo:abstract	"\"Shapes of Things\" is a song by the English rock group the Yardbirds. With its Eastern-sounding, feedback-laden guitar solo and anti-war/pro-environmental lyrics, it \"can justifiably be classified as the first psychedelic rock classic\", according to music critic Richie Unterberger. The song was built on musical elements contributed by several group members in three different recording studios in the US. When it was released as a single on 25 February 1966, it was their first composition to become a record chart hit. The song reached the pop Top 40 in several countries, but, aside from compilations, was not included on a Yardbirds' album. The song features Jeff Beck's musical use of feedback, which he learned to control by finding the guitar's resonant points and bending the strings. Music writers have called his work groundbreaking and cited its influence on Paul McCartney and Jimi Hendrix. Several live Yardbirds recordings with Beck and later with Jimmy Page have been released. In 1968, Beck reworked it for the lead track on his debut album Truth. The new arrangement, along with other album tracks, has been described as a precursor of heavy metal. \"Shapes of Things\" is included in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's permanent exhibit of the \"Songs That Shaped Rock and Roll\" and several artists have recorded renditions of the song."@en ;

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Last_Night_a_D.J._Saved_My_Life>	rdf:type	dbo:MusicalWork ;
	dbo:abstract	"\"Last Night a D.J. Saved My Life\" is a song written by Michael Cleveland for American group Indeep. It features vocals from R\u00E9jane \"Reggie\" Magloire and Rose Marie Ramsey. The lyrics tell the story of a woman who is bored alone at home. She wants to speak to her man, but cannot reach him and considers leaving him, until a DJ plays a hot song and thereby saves her life. In the second verse, she leaves home, but does not reach her destination. The sound of squeaky wheels suggests she has an accident, but is saved by a DJ playing a good song on the radio. The song was mixed by Tony Humphries and released as a single in 1982, becoming the most popular and successful hit released by its record label, Sound of New York/Becket Records. In the U.S. \"Last Night a D.J. Saved My Life\" reached number ten on the R&B/Hip-Hop Singles chart and number two on the Club Singles chart. In February 1983 it peaked at number thirteen in the United Kingdom, and in March 1983 at number two in the Dutch Top 40 and the Belgium Ultratop 50. The track appears as the third track of the namesake album released in 1983. Rolling Stone magazine declared the song \"one of the greatest songs ever written about being a girl, listening to the radio, or any combination of the two,\" and, in 2005, editors of Blender magazine placed it at number 406 on its 500 Greatest Songs Since You Were Born list. The song also provided the inspiration of the title of the book Last Night a DJ Saved My Life: The History of the Disc Jockey (2000). Because of the limited success of Indeep's later releases, the group's first single was its only major hit and placed it into the one-hit wonder category of artists."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"Raindrops Keep Fallin' on My Head\" was written by Hal David and Burt Bacharach for the 1969 film Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid. It won an Academy Award for Best Original Song. David and Bacharach also won Best Original Score. The song was recorded by B. J. Thomas in seven takes, after Bacharach expressed dissatisfaction with the first six. In the film version of the song, Thomas had been recovering from laryngitis, which made his voice sound hoarser than in the 7-inch release. The film version featured a separate vaudeville-style instrumental break in double time while Paul Newman performed bicycle stunts. The single by B. J. Thomas reached number 1 on charts in the United States, Canada, Norway and reached number 38 in the UK Singles Chart. It topped the Billboard Hot 100 for four weeks in January 1970 and was also the first American number-one hit of the 1970s. The song also spent seven weeks atop the Billboard adult contemporary chart. Billboard ranked it as the No. 4 song of 1970. According to Billboard magazine, Thomas' single had sold over 2 million copies by March 14, 1970, with eight-track and cassette versions also climbing the charts."@en ;

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/I_Am..._I_Said>	rdf:type	dbo:MusicalWork ;
	dbo:abstract	"\"I Am... I Said\" is a song written and recorded by Neil Diamond. Released as a single on March 15, 1971, it was quite successful, at first slowly climbing the charts, then more quickly rising to number 4 on the U.S. pop singles chart by May 1971. It fared similarly across the Atlantic, reaching number 4 on the UK pop singles chart as well. \"I Am... I Said\" took Diamond four months to compose. One of his most intensely personal efforts, it depicts the singer lost between two worlds: Verses start quietly in a low vocal range, half sung and half spoken, with a soft rock guitar and light strings backing. By the chorus climaxes, the vocals are much louder and higher in pitch, with horns, heavier drums and more strings joining in, but the singer even more uncertain: Neil Diamond told Mojo magazine July 2008 that this song came from a time he spent in therapy in Los Angeles. He said: In the same month, he told Q that the song was written \"to find [him]self\" and added,\"I Am... I Said\" was later included on Diamond's November 1971 album Stones. The single version leads off the LP, while a reprise of the song, taken from midway to a variant ending with Diamond exclaiming \"I am!\", concludes. Critical opinion on \"I Am... I Said\" has generally been good, with Rolling Stone calling its lyric excellent in a 1972 review, while The New Yorker used it to exemplify Diamond's songwriting opaqueness in a 2006 retrospective. A 2008 Diamond profile in The Daily Telegraph simply referred to the song's \"raging existential angst,\" and Allmusic calls it \"an impassioned statement of emotional turmoil... very much in tune with the confessional singer/songwriter movement of the time.\" The song never went without its detractors however. Humorist Dave Barry said: The song garnered Diamond his first Grammy Awards nomination, for Best Pop Vocal Performance, Male. \"I Am... I Said\" has been included in live versions on Diamond's Hot August Night (from 1972, in a performance that Rolling Stone would later label \"fantastically overwrought\") and The Greatest Hits: 1966-1992 (from 1992), as well as in various compilations."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"This Used to Be My Playground\" is a song by American singer Madonna. It is the theme for the film A League of Their Own, which starred Madonna, and portrayed a fictionalized account of the real-life All-American Girls Professional Baseball League. Madonna was asked to record a song for the film's soundtrack. At that time she was busy recording her fifth studio album, Erotica, with producer Shep Pettibone. They worked on some ideas and came up with \"This Used to Be My Playground\" in two days. Once presented to Marshall's team, the song was released as a standalone single on June 16, 1992, by Warner Bros. Records. However, it was not available on the film's soundtrack due to contractual obligations and was later added to the Olympics-inspired Barcelona Gold compilation album, released that summer. The song was included on Madonna's 1995 ballads compilation Something to Remember. Written and produced by Madonna and Pettibone, \"This Used to Be My Playground\" was the first time that Pettibone worked with live string arrangement. Madonna recorded the song on a Shure SM57 microphone, with instrumentation from piano, organ, strings and a basic drum sounds. During the final recording, the duo had to redo the whole orchestra section to tailor it for the song. \"This Used to Be My Playground\" starts with a keyboard introduction and strings, with Madonna singing in expressive but subdued vocals. Its verse and chorus merge into each other making the song sound seamless. Lyrically it talks about visiting one's childhood places and not letting go of the past, with an abrupt ending. The song received positive reviews from critics, who noted it as an essential addition in Madonna's repertoire. The song earned the singer a Golden Globe Award nomination for Best Original Song. It was a commercial success, reaching the top of the charts on the US Billboard Hot 100. The track was Madonna's tenth chart-topping single, breaking her tie with Whitney Houston to become the female artist with the most number one singles at that time. It also reached the top of the charts in Canada, Finland, Italy and Sweden, while reaching the top-ten of the charts in Australia, Belgium, France, Germany, Ireland, Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. Even though the song was commercially successful, Madonna has never performed it in any of her concert tours, nor included it on her greatest hits albums, GHV2 (2001) and Celebration (2009)."@en ;

It was the official song of the England World Cup squad in the 2006 FIFA World Cup campaign, and was released on 5 June 2006 (see 2006 in British music). Singer Danny McNamara told the NME: \"We didn't apply to do this. They just asked us. Our manager said, 'Do you want to do the World Cup song? The FA want to know.' I asked my dad and he said, 'if you think you're up to it-do it!' I was just trying to cover all the bases.\" It was broadcast on Radio 1 on 21 April by Chris Moyles. A news reporter on BBC One was in a Bristol pub at the time and had several people listen and review the song. The first impressions were that the song is \"too slow\". This caused Moyles and a good friend of members of the band to shout out on the radio, live, \"It's not too slow, it's perfect. Shut up and enjoy it.\" While it does not have the terrace chant appeal of classic World Cup and European Cup songs such as \"Vindaloo\" or \"Three Lions\", many reviews from music critics seem to find favour with it - for instance, Planet Sound gave it an 8/10 mark, calling it \"brilliant\".[citation needed]"@en ;

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Stay_(I_Missed_You)>	rdf:type	dbo:MusicalWork ;
	dbo:abstract	"\"Stay (I Missed You)\" is a song by American singer-songwriter Lisa Loeb. It was released in May 1994 as the lead single from the original movie soundtrack Reality Bites (1994). The song was written and composed by Loeb herself, while production was handled by Juan Pati\u00F1o and Loeb, who previously produced some of her songs back with Nine Stories. \"Stay\" was originally conceived in 1990 when she formed the band Nine Stories, who were then featured in the song (they were credited separated from Loeb). Loeb's neighbor and friend, actor Ethan Hawke had found out about the song and submitted it to actor Ben Stiller's directional film soundtrack Reality Bites which was then accepted. Musically, \"Stay\" is a pop rock song that has been influenced with folk music. Lyrically, the song deals with a relationship that is in trouble, but the singer tries to reconcile with her lover. \"Stay\" received positive reviews from most music critics, who praised the lyrical and production side and likened the song's commercial potential. Several critics had listed the song in some of the best song lists. \"Stay\" ultimately went on to become a number-one hit on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, earning her the distinction of being the first artist to top the U.S. chart before being signed to any record label. The song was commercially successful in countries including New Zealand, Australia and the United Kingdom. The song's music video was produced and directed by close friend Ethan Hawke who lived near her apartment in New York City. For their performance of the song Lisa Loeb and Nine Stories were nominated for a Grammy for Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals, but lost to All-4-One's \"I Swear\"."@en ;

It is said that Otis wrote the song for a girlfriend who used strawberry-scented paper when she wrote letters to him, but Otis himself says that this is not true. He recorded it for his 1971 album Freedom Flight. George Johnson, of the Brothers Johnson, was dating one of Otis's cousins when he came across the album Freedom Flight. The group recorded \"Strawberry Letter 23\" for their 1977 album Right on Time, which was produced by Quincy Jones, and the album went platinum. They recorded the song in a funkier, more dance-oriented vein than the original Otis version. Their rendition hit the Billboard Hot 100 and peaked at number five and reached number one on the Soul Singles chart in 1977. Studio guitar player Lee Ritenour recreated Otis's original guitar solo for the Brothers Johnson cover. The 12\" single was pressed on red strawberry-scented vinyl."@en ;

It was the third single from their highly successful 1998 album Stunt (the song \"Alcohol\" had been previously released to radio stations, but was not sold commercially as a single). When released as a single, the song was both remixed and edited into a radio mix which cut from the second verse to the third chorus, skipping a chorus, an instrumental break and the third verse. The remix was a slight adjustment of EQ and levels, and not a comprehensive remix involving adding or replacing musical elements. The song was also included on the soundtrack for the film, EdTV. The song was written by Steven Page and his longtime collaborator, Stephen Duffy. All of the vocals in the song are performed by Page; this includes overlapping vocals, harmonies and octaves, and a call-and-response chorus. This, in addition to a long ad-lib outro makes the song a showcase of Page's vocal abilities. In live performances, the backing vocals were performed by bandmates Ed Robertson and Jim Creeggan. The song seems to be about the reconciliation of a tumultuous relationship. The song was performed on CBC Radio as a tribute to Peter Gzowski on his death in 2002. It was also performed as a duet with Alanis Morissette in 2004 during the co-headlining Au Naturale Tour. \"Call and Answer\" was the last song Page performed as a member of Barenaked Ladies, on February 5, 2009.

	dbo:abstract	"\"Just My Imagination (Running Away with Me)\" is a song by American soul group The Temptations. Released on the Gordy (Motown) label, and produced by Norman Whitfield, it features on the group's 1971 album, Sky's the Limit. When released as a single, \"Just My Imagination\" became the third Temptations song to reach number one on the US Billboard Hot 100. The single held the number one position on the Billboard Pop Singles Chart for two weeks in 1971, from March 27 to April 10. \"Just My Imagination\" also held the number-one spot on the Billboard R&B Singles chart for three weeks, from February 27 to March 20 of that year. Today, \"Just My Imagination\" is considered one of the Temptations' signature songs, and is notable for recalling the sound of the group's 1960s recordings. It is also the final Temptations single to feature founding members Eddie Kendricks and Paul Williams. During the process of recording and releasing the single, Kendricks left the group to begin a solo career, while the ailing Williams was forced to retire from the act for health reasons. In 2004, Rolling Stone magazine listed \"Just My Imagination\" as number 389 on its list of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time."@en ;

This version of \"Papa\" was released as a single in early 1972, and peaked at number 63 on the pop charts and number 24 on the R&B charts. Later that year, Whitfield, who also produced the song, took \"Papa Was a Rollin' Stone\" and remade it as a 12-minute record for The Temptations, which was a number-one hit on the Billboard Hot 100 and won three Grammy Awards in 1973. While the original Undisputed Truth version of the song has been largely forgotten, The Temptations' version of the song has been an enduring and influential soul classic. It was ranked #168 on Rolling Stone's list of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time, one of the group's three songs on the list. In retrospect, The Temptations' Otis Williams considers \"Papa\" to be the last real classic the group recorded (it would be the Temptations' last #1 hit and would win them their second and final Grammy in a competitive category)."@en ;

In an interview in October 2007 lead vocalist, Eddie Jacobson, recalls \"Everytime\" reached No. 38 in the Triple J's Hottest 100 of 2003, the first appearance by the band in the Hottest 100. The song also reached No. 16 on the AIR Independent Charts in May 2003."@en ;

dbr:Calm_Like_a_Bomb	rdf:type	dbo:MusicalWork ;
	dbo:abstract	"\"Calm Like a Bomb\" is a song by American band Rage Against the Machine, off their third album The Battle of Los Angeles. Like their song \"Tire Me\" from the 1996 album Evil Empire, \"Calm Like A Bomb\" never had a music video or was released on any media formats. It did however, receive enough radio airplay to become an album favorite. The artwork most commonly associated with the song is from a competition the band held for the then upcoming album The Battle of Los Angeles. Competing artists were given titles to put on their covers including \"Agunzagun\", \"Battle Hymns\" and of course, \"The Battle of Los Angeles\". One of the titles was even a verse from \"Calm Like A Bomb\" - \"The Riot Be The Rhyme Of The Unheard\". Tom Morello eventually used the name \"Battle Hymns\" for a track on his debut album, One Man Revolution in 2007. \"Calm Like A Bomb\" is notable as a display of guitarist Tom Morello's creative use of a whammy pedal. Like many of RATM's songs, the song's lyrics discuss social inequalities. The song also features a reference to Emiliano Zapata. Tim Commerford uses a combination of a home-made overdrive pedal and the Jim Dunlop 105Q Bass Wah pedal on his bass throughout the song. In Rolling Stone magazine's feature article this past year on the new \"Guitar Heroes,\" a section was printed about Tom Morello, and Calm Like a Bomb was cited as the prime example of his skill and fame on the guitar. He has occasionally referred to the extremely high whammy-pedal effects used in songs such as this as \"pterodactyl sounds.\" \"Calm Like A Bomb\" made its live debut on June 11, 1999, at the K-Rock Dysfunctional Family Picnic in Wantagh, New York at Jones Beach Amphitheater. It was prominently featured in the ending credits of The Matrix Reloaded and was also included in the film's soundtrack."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"Ciega, Sordomuda\" (English: Blind, deaf-mute) is a song written and performed by Colombian-born singer Shakira from her second studio album D\u00F3nde Est\u00E1n los Ladrones? (1998). It was written by Est\u00E9fano and Shakira. It was released on August 13, 1998, as the lead single from the album. \"Ciega, Sordomuda\" is a latin pop song, and the lyrics express her clumsy feeling when the person that she loves is near; she doesn't pay attention to their signals because she is completely blinded. The song reached the number-one spot on Billboard Hot Latin Tracks chart for three weeks in 1998. It was a hit all over Latin America, reaching #1 in the charts of every single country. It also became one of the most successful songs of the 1990s. It remains as one of her best-known songs and has been performed several times since its release, most recently during her The Sun Comes Out World Tour. The song's accompanying music video, directed by Gustavo Garz\u00F3n, was shot on a beach in California, and features the singer being chased by policemen in a nightclub, where the plot takes a turn toward surreal. The song was ranked as one of the best songs of the 1990s, and ranked 7th place on the 100 greatest songs of the 1990s in Spanish, according to VH1."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"I Wish I Was a Punk Rocker (With Flowers in My Hair)\" is the debut single by Scottish singer-songwriter Sandi Thom. The song was written by Tom Gilbert and Thom herself. The song was originally released in October 2005 by Viking Legacy Records, reaching number 55 in the UK Singles Chart. It was re-released in May 2006 on Sony's RCA Records label, and went on to be the UK's fifth best selling single of the year. Also successful in Australia, it was on the ARIA Charts for ten weeks at number-one, and finished the year as the country's highest selling single and accrediting double platinum. The music video was shot in Bethnal Green in London. Although only released physically on 22 May 2006 in the UK, download sales the week before are counted for the purpose of charts, and it achieved number fifteen on this basis in the general charts (and number seven in the download-only chart). The physical release had three formats: two CD versions (one featuring the radio mix and \"A Light as Bright as Ours\", another featuring the radio mix, the album mix, a further remix, \"May You Never\" and the music video), and also as a 7\" vinyl record backed with Stranglers cover \"No More Heroes\". The single sold 39,797 copies in the week ending 4 June 2006, enough to reach number one, knocking Gnarls Barkley's \"Crazy\" off the top spot after it was withdrawn following a nine week run. The song was nominated for \"Record of the Year\", but lost to \"Patience\" by Take That. Thom has been the subject of criticism by many artists within the recording world, most notably from Lily Allen, The Fratellis and The Automatic. James Frost and Robin Hawkins from The Automatic stated that \"If she was a punk rocker with flowers in her hair she'd get the shit kicked out of her by other punk rockers, for having flowers in her hair. [...] I haven't found anyone who's told me they like that song and bought it.\" Charlie Brooker also heavily criticised the intense public relations efforts to make the single popular."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"Woman in Love\" is a song performed by Barbra Streisand and taken from her 1980 album, Guilty. The song was written by Barry and Robin Gibb of the Bee Gees, who received the 1980 Ivor Novello award for Best Song Musically and Lyrically. It is her fourth of four Platinum records, and is considered her greatest international hit. After the success enjoyed by the Bee Gees in the late 1970s, the band was asked to participate in musical endeavors for other artists, and Streisand asked Barry Gibb to write an album for her. This album ultimately became Guilty. \"Woman in Love\", as the lead single, became one of the most successful songs of Streisand's music career. It reached the number-one position on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, Streisand's fifth (and last to date) number one hit on that chart. It notably replaced Queen's mega smash hit \"Another One Bites the Dust\", spent three weeks at number one, and was itself replaced by country singer Kenny Rogers'\"Lady\".\"Woman in Love\" spent three weeks at the top of the chart. It also spent five weeks atop the adult contemporary chart, her sixth number one on that tally. The song also proved very popular internationally, reaching number one in many countries, including in the UK Singles Chart. The song sold more than 2.5 millions till December 1981, according to Billboard. About midway through the song, Streisand holds a note for about 10 seconds while singing the line: I stumble and fall / But I give you it all (the word \"all\" is the one held for that duration). During the chart run of \"Woman In Love\", Casey Kasem claimed in an edition of the radio program American Top 40 that this was the longest unaltered note held by a soloist in a number-one song[citation needed]. However, this was corrected a few weeks later as at the time, \"Lovely Day\" by Bill Withers, \"All Out Of Love\" by Air Supply and \"Dim All The Lights\" by Donna Summer had longer notes held. Streisand has openly stated that she doesn't like the song because she doesn't believe in the meaning of the lyrics. She has rarely performed the song live; she did, however, sing it on a couple of dates on her 2013 European tour."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"Headline News\" is a parody song by \"Weird Al\" Yankovic. It is a parody of the Crash Test Dummies's 1993 hit \"Mmm Mmm Mmm Mmm\". It was released as the lead-off single for the compilation box set Permanent Record: Al in the Box on September 27, 1994. The song was written after Yankovic's label insisted he craft a new song to promote the album; Yankovic in turn combined the music of the Crash Test Dummies' song with three news stories that were popular in late 1993 and early 1994. To help promote the song and album, Yankovic directed a music video that was a direct parody of the Crash Test Dummies' original. In it, the three news stories are presented as if they are one-act plays before an audience of people. The video took two days to film and ended up running over the allotted time that had been scheduled for filming. The resulting video was also extremely expensive to fund. Several notable individuals made cameos in the video, such as Doug Llewelyn, Dr. Demento, Yokozuna and Judy Tenuta. The song and video were met with mostly positive reviews from critics, although at least one critic noted that the source material would soon become dated. The Crash Test Dummies were very pleased with the final result and even performed the song with Yankovic in concert twice. \"Headline News\" charted at number four on the Billboard Bubbling Under Hot 100 Singles chart, making it Yankovic's first single to chart domestically since 1992's \"Smells Like Nirvana\"."@en .

Although it failed to reach the top ten in either the UK or Ireland on its initial release, it has since become their most popular song worldwide, initially becoming a number 1 hit in Iceland, before reaching number 1 in both Australia and New Zealand in early 1989, and in 1993 the song reached the top five on both the US Billboard Hot 100 and Canadian Hot 100 charts following its appearance in the film Benny & Joon. In 2007 the Proclaimers re-recorded the song with English comedians Peter Kay and Matt Lucas for the Comic Relief charity, scoring a number one hit in the UK. \"I'm Gonna Be (500 Miles)\" has become a live staple at the Proclaimers' concerts. The duo played it at Edinburgh 50,000 \u2013 The Final Push at Murrayfield Stadium on 6 July 2005, the final concert of Live 8, to symbolise the conclusion of \"The Long Walk to Justice\". The song was mainly written by Craig Reid in mid-1987 while waiting to travel to a Proclaimers concert in Aberdeen. Reid recalled, \"I can remember sitting at the piano and the chords just came to me. I reckon I wrote the whole thing in 45 minutes. I knew that it was a good song, maybe even a single, but I had no idea how popular it would become.\" Reid has said that the band's earnings from the song are about five times the rest of their catalogue combined."@en ;

Cuomo made a connection to an incident in high school where he came home and saw a bottle of beer in the fridge. He believed his mother and father's marriage ended because his father was an alcoholic and this made him fear the marriage between his mother and step-father would end this way as well. In 2008, Rolling Stone ranked \"Say It Ain't So\" #72 on \"The 100 Greatest Guitar Songs of All Time.\" Pitchfork Media included the song at number 10 on its Top 200 Tracks of the 90s. \"Say It Ain't So\" is a playable track in the video games Rock Band and Rocksmith 2014 in addition to appearing on an episode of Hindsight."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"Comme ci, comme \u00E7a\" (English translation: \"Like This, Like That\" or \"So-So\") was the Cypriot entry in the Eurovision Song Contest 2007, performed in French by Evridiki. The song was composed by Dimitris Korgialas and written by Poseidonas Giannopoulos. This was the first Cypriot entry to feature lyrics in a language other than Greek, Italian or English, as well as the first entry from a non-Francophone country to be performed entirely in French. Evridiki's decision to sing this her third Eurovision entry in French was not entirely unexpected; she had previously recorded both 1992's \"Teriazoume\" and 1994's \"Eimai Anthropos Ki Ego\" in French, as \"Le feu c'est nous\" and \"Fen\u00EAtre sur cour\" respectively, as well as in English. \"Comme ci, comme \u00E7a\" is a moderately up-tempo number, with influences both from rock and techno. Evridiki addresses herself to her lover, telling him that she finds it difficult to live with him. She complains that every Monday he finishes work too late to enjoy her, falling asleep \"just as my heart wakes up\". He also promises that they will see a movie every Tuesday, but is unable to keep this promise. Following these criticisms, she explains that the unexciting routine of their relationship is too much for her and that she is no longer in love with him. As the chorus continues, it becomes apparent that she intends to leave him. The performance featured a full band, with guitar, drums and electronic keyboard. Evridiki wore a revealing silver dress. As Cyprus had not finished the previous Contest in the top ten, the song was performed in the semi-final. Here, it was performed third (following Israel's Teapacks with \"Push The Button\" and preceding Belarus' Koldun with \"Work Your Magic\"). At the close of voting, it had received 65 points, placing 15th in a field of 28. The result was not enough to qualify Cyprus for the final and as a result the country will have to qualify through the semi-final at the next Contest. It was succeeded as Cypriot representative at the 2008 Contest by Evdokia Kadi with \"Femme Fatale\"."@en ;

dbr:People_Got_to_Be_Free	rdf:type	dbo:MusicalWork ;
	dbo:abstract	"\"People Got to Be Free\" is a song released in 1968 by The Rascals. Written by group members Felix Cavaliere and Eddie Brigati and featuring a lead vocal from Cavaliere, it is a musically upbeat but impassioned plea for tolerance and freedom: In the song's coda, Felix says in a half-sung, half-spoken voice, that the \"Train of Freedom\", is \"about to arrive any minute now\", that \"it has been long, long overdue\", and that it's \"coming right on through\", before the song's fade with Felix saying \"Chug\" repeatedly. It became a big hit in the turbulent summer of 1968, spending five weeks atop the Billboard Pop Singles chart, the group's longest such stay. It was also the group's second-most successful single on the Billboard Black Singles chart, reaching number 14 and trailing only the previous year's \"Groovin'\". \"People Got to Be Free\" was RIAA-certified as a gold record on August 23, 1968, and eventually sold over 4 million copies. It later was included on the group's March 1969 album Freedom Suite. Billboard ranked the record as the No. 5 song for 1968. The single's picture sleeve photo was previously featured in the inner album cover of the Rascals' Time Peace: The Rascals' Greatest Hits compilation. The B-side, \"My World\", was a track from the group's Once Upon a Dream album. While \"People Got to Be Free\" was perceived by some as related to the assassinations of Martin Luther King, Jr. and Robert F. Kennedy earlier that year, it was recorded before the latter's death. In fact it was partly a reaction to an ugly encounter wherein the long-haired group was threatened by a group of strangers after their tour vehicle broke down in Fort Pierce, Florida. The song is clearly a product of its times; however, two decades later writer Dave Marsh included it as number 237 in his book Heart of Rock and Soul: The 1001 Greatest Singles of All Time, saying in reference to, and paraphrase of, the song's lyric, \"Ask me my opinion, my opinion will be: Dated, but NEVER out of date.\" After this song came out, the Rascals would only perform at concerts that featured an African American act; if those conditions were not met, the Rascals canceled several shows in protest. Dionne Warwick recorded the song as part of her LP Soulful in 1969, and it was released as a single in the UK in the same year. The 5th Dimension recorded \"People Got to Be Free\" in 1970 as part of a medley with another socially relevant song, Sam Cooke's \"A Change Is Gonna Come.\" The pairing reached number 60 on the Billboard Pop Singles chart. Johnny Maestro & the Brooklyn Bridge performed this song live in concert, and it has turned up on YouTube as part of The Bridge's \"lost tapes\" series of songs."@en ;

The song became their third number-one hit on the Billboard Hot 100, as well as their third number-one on the Hot Soul Singles chart. The song was met with a degree of controversy, since the lyrics were interpreted or likely speculated by many as having sexual connotations. However, according to KC, it had a lot more meaning and depth. During his performance he would witness the entire crowd having a good time except for some minority. The song inspired people to \"get off their can and get out there and do it\". The B-side of Shake Your Booty was \"Boogie Shoes\", which later became a hit on its own when it appeared on the Saturday Night Fever soundtrack in 1977. \"(Shake, Shake, Shake) Shake Your Booty\" holds the record for being the only number-one song title with a word repeated more than three times in it.

	dbo:abstract	"\"A Trick of the Night\" is a ballad recorded by English girl group Bananarama. It was written and produced by Steve Jolley and Tony Swain and released as the final single from Bananarama's album True Confessions. The song was remixed slightly for its single version, adding extra synthesizer lines and vocal harmony layering. It was also given a more \"upbeat\" remix by the Stock Aitken Waterman (SAW) production trio, at the request of London Records for the UK release. The cautionary message in the lyrics are directed towards a friend who has gone to seek his fortune in the big city and ended up a rentboy. \"A Trick of the Night\" was a top-forty hit in the UK, peaking at number thirty-two (the SAW-remixed version received the most airplay in their home country), while the ballad version stalled at number seventy-six on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100. The single spent one week in the Australian Kent Music Report top 100 singles chart, where it peaked at number ninety-nine. \"A Trick of the Night\" peaked at number twenty-four in Ireland. The song was included on the CD version of Greatest Hits Collection as a bonus track; it was not included on the vinyl version nor their 2001 compilation The Very Best of Bananarama. It was included on the soundtrack to the 1986 American film Jumpin' Jack Flash."@en ;

dbr:I_Wish_It_Could_Be_Christmas_Everyday	rdf:type	dbo:MusicalWork ;
	dbo:abstract	"\"I Wish It Could Be Christmas Everyday\" is a Christmas song by British glam rock band Wizzard. It was first released in December 1973. Despite the song's strong, long-lasting popularity, it has reached no higher than number four on the UK Singles Chart, a position it occupied for four consecutive weeks from December 1973 to January 1974. As with most Wizzard songs, it was written and produced by Roy Wood \u2014 formerly of The Move and a founding member of ELO. The song was famously beaten to the 1973 Christmas Number 1 spot by Slade's \"Merry Xmas Everybody\" which remained at the top of the charts for five weeks, from December 1973 to January 1974. Roy Wood sings lead vocals. The backing vocals for the single are by \"The Suedettes\", augmented by the choir of Stockland Green Bilateral School First Year. The original sleeve of the single credits \"Miss Snob and Class 3C\" with \"Additional noises\". The basic track for the single was recorded in August 1973, so to create a wintry feeling engineer Steve Brown decorated the studio with Christmas decorations and turned the air conditioning down to its coldest setting. Wood wore a woollen hat found in lost property. The schoolchildren were brought down from the Midlands to London by bus during the autumn half-term to add their contributions. At the time of the single's release, Wizzard's contract with EMI was close to expiration. Promotional copies were pressed by Warner Brothers, with whom the band had just signed for future releases. Only then was it discovered that EMI were legally entitled to the track after all, so the Warner Bros. Records pressings were halted and the record appeared on the Harvest label, but with the same picture sleeve. Although Wood had arranged for the members of the Stockland Green School choir to sing at the Top of the Pops television recording, their place was taken by children provided by a local London stage school."@en ;

It was the first R.E.M. song released as a single to fail to reach the top 40 on either chart since \"Get Up\" in 1989. Regarding the song's backing vocals, Mike Mills explained to Melody Maker: \"'Harborcoat' from Reckoning has got me and Michael and Bill all doing completely unrelated things, and yet it works together. Because of the production we insisted on from Mitch and Don, which I know must have been incredibly frustrating for them, it's hard to pick out exactly what's going on. We tried it again on \"Find The River.\" I had the idea that Bill and I would go in and do some harmonies without listening to each other. It's great because mine is this incredibly angst-ridden emotional thing, and Bill's is this really low-key sort of ambling part. They're two opposite ends of the spectrum but they're both on there, and it's a beautiful thing.\" The music video was shot in Malibu, California, directed by Jodi Wille, and features a stripped-down studio performance by the band and Los Angeles \"outsider\" artist Henry Hill. In An Hour with R.E.M., which aired on MTV UK prior to the band's televised performance at Cologne Cathedral in 2001, Mills introduced the video and explained that he selected it \"because...

	dbo:abstract	"\"Hit the Freeway\" is a song by the American recording artist Toni Braxton, released as the lead-single from her fourth studio album, More Than a Woman (2002). The song, which features American rapper Loon, was written by Pharrell Williams and Loon himself, while production was handled by Pharrell's production duo The Neptunes. It is an R&B and hip-hop song, with lyrics about an ex trying to rekindle with Braxton, but Braxton claims she's not interested in him anymore. The song received generally favorable reviews from music critics, who praised its catchiness and contagiousness, and picked it as a stand-out track. However, the song proved to be a failure on the charts, reaching the top-forty in Canada, Sweden, Switzerland and UK, while only reaching number 86 on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart. A music video, directed by Charles Infante and Dave Meyers, was released in October 2002 and it features Braxton being chased by her ex."@en ;

Written by Jackson and Dallas Austin, the song fuses pop with elements of rock, dance, and funk and is a reflection of Jackson's new-found happiness. The song leaked ahead of its scheduled release and was sent to radio following Jackson's controversial Super Bowl Halftime Show performance incident on February 2, 2004. \"Just a Little While\" received favorable reception from critics, who felt its elements of rock and dance-pop would ensure success. However, following her controversial Super Bowl incident, Jackson's singles and music videos were blacklisted on many radio formats and music channels worldwide, affecting the song's performance. Although it's success in the U.S. was limited, peaking at number 45 on the Billboard Hot 100, it did manage to peak atop the Hot Dance Club Songs chart. Internationally, it proved to be more successful, reaching the top ten in Belgium, Canada, and Spain and the top twenty in Australia and The United Kingdom. It peaked at number one in Japan for five weeks, and was the year's second biggest hit on Japan's international airplay chart. The song's music video, directed by Dave Meyers, was released exclusively in international territories due to the controversy surrounding Jackson at the time. It portrays Jackson filming a DVD for her boyfriend in a futuristic apartment setting, displaying her multiple personae. An alternate live video, filmed in London, was included on Jackson's From janet. to Damita Jo compilation. Jackson performed the song on television shows including Top of the Pops, Hey! Hey!

The song peaked at number one on the Billboard Hot Dance Club Songs. Internationally, the song topped the charts in the United Kingdom, peaked within the top ten of the charts in Austria, Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, the Republic of Ireland and Switzerland and the top twenty of the charts in Canada and Switzerland. The song's title and lyrics reference Sigmund Freud's theory of the unconscious which holds that the human Ego is not free and is instead controlled by its own unconscious Id (see Id, ego and super-ego); in Freud's own words, \"das Ich ist nicht Herr im eigenen Hause\" (\"the Ego is not king of its own castle\"). Hence, one of the song's two music videos consists of footage from the 1995 anime film Ghost in the Shell, where people with cyborg implants have their actions controlled against their will by a hacker criminal known in the film as \"puppetmaster\". \"King of My Castle\" was re-released in 2009 but was available on YouTube from November 2008 and includes new remixes by Rowald Steyn, Mischa Daniels and Armin van Buuren."@en ;

Guitarist Brian May \u2013 the writer of the song \u2013 and drummer Roger Taylor share lead vocals. The song was released on the album Queen Rocks and it was also released as a double a-side single with \"Tie Your Mother Down\". The impetus for the song came after the death of Diana, Princess of Wales in August 1997, but is largely a eulogy to Freddie Mercury. It was dedicated to Mercury and all those that die too soon. It was originally written for a potential Brian May solo project, which eventually evolved into the album Another World. He sent the demo of the song to Roger Taylor, who according to Taylor himself, put it in a drawer and forgot about it. After eventually hearing it, Taylor suggested that it could be turned into a Queen song. Roger Taylor's contribution was to change the tempo and make the lyrics less specific to Mercury. The song features only the remaining three members of Queen, the final new recording to be released under the Queen name alone. This is also the last new recording to feature John Deacon, who subsequently retired from public life. This is the last original Queen release until the 2014 release Queen Forever."@en ;

dbr:The_Wind_Cries_Mary	rdf:type	dbo:MusicalWork ;
	dbo:abstract	"\"The Wind Cries Mary\" is a rock ballad written by Jimi Hendrix and released by the Jimi Hendrix Experience as the band's third single on May 5, 1967. It reached no. 6 in the UK Charts. It is ranked number 379 on Rolling Stone's list of the 500 greatest songs of all time. It has been covered by musicians such as Jamie Cullum, John Mayer, Xavier Rudd, Richie Sambora, Sting, Popa Chubby, Pat Boone and Caron Wheeler. In the United States, the song was first released as the B-side to the \"Purple Haze\" single in June 1967 and later appeared on the August 1967 American version of the album Are You Experienced, where three tracks were deleted from the British LP version to make way for the band's three singles that had been issued in the United Kingdom. The song was recorded at the end of the \"Fire\" sessions. It is said to have been inspired when Hendrix and his then girlfriend, Kathy Etchingham, had an argument over her cooking; after she stormed out of their apartment; Hendrix wrote \"The Wind Cries Mary\", as Mary was Etchingham's middle name. Another possible inspiration could be the poem \"To Mary\" by the English poet John Clare. Kathy Etchingham has said that many of the Dylanesque lyrics describe the test card that appeared at the end of BBC television transmissions at that time. However, this is probably a mistake on her part as that particular testcard was not first broadcast until July 1967, while the song had been written long before that. Jimi mentioned The Wind Cries Mary in an interview with Sue C. Clark in December 1969, saying '...it's like The Wind Cries Mary is representing more than one person...' Billy Cox, who was the bassist for the Band of Gypsys and long-time friend of Hendrix has cited Curtis Mayfield's influence on the song:The last line to Pink Floyd's \"Several Species of Small Furry Animals Gathered Together in a Cave and Grooving With a Pict\" was \"and the wind cried Mary\" The song was in included in Guitar Hero World Tour along with a live version of \"Purple Haze\". It was also included as a downloadable track for the Rock Band series.\"The Wind Cries Mary\" and \"Highway Chile\" were re-released in 1983, on The Singles Album compilation. \"The Wind Cries Mary\" is the title of the second episode of the fourth season of the FX Network's Archer television series, with \"Mary\" a reference to the gay-romance element of the storyline."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"This Is the House\" was Eurythmics' third single, recorded in 1982 on their own 8-track home studio in north London, built with a personal bank loan from group member David A. Stewart's bank manager rather than record company support. Although the following year it was included on the group's hugely successful Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This) album, the single itself was a commercial flop, failing to chart. No music video was made for the single. The recordings were produced by Stewart and Adam Williams, ex-bassist of 2 Tone Records band The Selecter. They showcased a new sound and direction from the group, focusing on synthesizers and drum machines as opposed to the psychedelic guitar-based band sound of their In the Garden album. The 12-inch single featured an extended remix of the track, plus four songs recorded on Eurythmics 1982 tour. This extended mix, plus the live mix of 'Your Time Will Come', were omitted from SonyBMG's 2005 remaster package, and remain unavailable on CD.

The song was originally written for Labelle (a trio led by Patti LaBelle) but they never recorded it. Much like the issue with \"I Miss You\" and The Dells passing on it, the song's composers Kenny Gamble and Leon Huff gave the song to Harold Melvin & the Blue Notes, which featured Teddy Pendergrass as lead vocalist. In addition to the single release, the song was included on their debut album I Miss You. Patti LaBelle later made the song as part of her concert repertoire in 1982. A live version appears on her 1985 album, Patti. It was later covered by the English pop/soul band Simply Red, also becoming their best-known hit after reaching number one on the U.S. Hot 100 on July 15, 1989 and at number thirty-eight on the Hot Black Singles chart. It peaked at number two in the UK Singles Chart. It also topped the Canadian Singles Chart. Seal recorded the song for his 2008 album Soul, and, in April 2009, it became his first top-ten Adult Contemporary hit since \"Love's Divine\" in 2004; the song was subsequently nominated for the Best Male Pop Vocal Performance Grammy. Rod Stewart also included this song on his 2009 album Soulbook. The song was chosen as one of the Songs of the Century by the RIAA.

The song was not included on the band's debut album Whatever People Say I Am, That's What I'm Not, though Alex Turner has stated that it could have been on the album as it follows a similar theme to many of the album tracks. It was the band's final release before promotion began for their second album Favourite Worst Nightmare in Spring 2007. However, it was not included on their second album either. The single's release was confirmed on the band's website on 6 July 2006, and that the track would be released on Monday, 14 August, on 3 track CD and 2 track 7\" vinyl. The website did not offer any further information, but NME's website announced that the two b-side tracks for the single will be covers, \"one of which will be their version of an old song and the other a cover of a track by one of their favourite groups.\" In July 2006, it was confirmed on Gonzo that \"Put Your Dukes Up, John\" by The Little Flames would be one of the cover versions. On 17 July, it emerged on an Arctic Monkeys fansite that the other cover version would be \"Baby, I'm Yours\" originally recorded by Barbara Lewis. The official website soon confirmed this and added that the track would be a collaboration with the 747s. The single entered the UK singles charts at number four on 20 August 2006, their first not to top the chart. \"Leave Before the Lights Come On\" was the Arctic Monkeys' first single to enter the Canadian Singles Chart and debuted at number two behind Eva Avila's \"Meant to Fly\" (2006) by only fifteen copies. It descended to number three in its second week and remained on the chart for seven weeks. Alex Turner confirmed the release of the single in an interview with NME: \"'Leave Before the Lights Come On' feels very much like it could be on the album. So we're going to put that out as a single. I remember it's the last song that I wrote about that sort of time, going out and that. My life's not really like that any more.\""@en ;

The song featured R&B singer Luther Vandross humming at the end of Stevie's verses and on backing vocals in addition to Wonder's ex-wife and fellow singer-songwriter Syreeta Wright and Philip Bailey of R&B/funk band Earth, Wind and Fire.

	dbo:abstract	"\"Shakespeare's Sister\" is a non-album single by British band The Smiths, released in March 1985. It first appeared on albums in 1987 via the Louder Than Bombs and The World Won't Listen compilations. Rock writer Jon Savage described it as \"essentially a suicide drama set to a demented rock'n'roll rhythm.\" Its title refers to a section of Virginia Woolf's feminist essay A Room of One's Own in which Woolf argues that if William Shakespeare had had a sister of equal genius, as a woman she would not have had the opportunity to make use of it. In reality, William Shakespeare had four sisters but the only one who survived past the age of eight was Joan. Sean O'Hagan says that Woolf's essay was \"one of the many feminist texts Morrissey embraced as a sexually confused, politically awakened adolescent.\" According to Simon Goddard the lyrics also draw on Elizabeth Smart's novella By Grand Central Station I Sat Down and Wept and the minor Billy Fury song \"Don't Jump\". The song's narrative has been compared to the play by Tennessee Williams 'The Glass Menagerie'. The original single's sleeve featured Pat Phoenix, best known for her long-running role as Elsie Tanner in the UK TV series Coronation Street. The song reached number 26 in the UK Singles Chart. The band Shakespears Sister [sic] took their name from the song."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"Sic Transit Gloria...Glory Fades\" is a 2004 single by the rock band Brand New from their second album Deja Entendu. The full phrase from which this song takes its title is Sic transit gloria mundi (Latin: \"Thus passes the glory of the world\"). This phrase has its origins in Ancient Rome, is used during Papal Coronations, and came to the attention of Brand New via the 1998 film Rushmore. The video raises parallels to two videos by the band Yellowcard, the strongest of which is the appearance of a white lamb on the door to the bar that Jesse Lacey enters. The symbol is also present on the briefcase that Ryan Key carries through the videos for \"Ocean Avenue\" and \"Rough Landing, Holly.\" This is because the videos were directed by Marc Webb, who used the lamb in his videos as a signature of sorts. It was rumored that the silhouette figure during the last shot in the video is Geoff Rickly,lead singer of the band Thursday (who are from nearby New Jersey), although it is actually Justin Beck, guitarist for Glassjaw. The 7\" was pressed on light pink vinyl and features a demo version of the song \"Jaws Theme Swimming.\" This demo song was recorded and mixed by Mike Sapone. In 2013, the song was covered by American pop punk band We Are the In Crowd."@en ;

In the same year, the song was also released on the album Signed, Sealed & Delivered. The song was a series of firsts for the 20-year-old Wonder: \"Signed, Sealed, Delivered I'm Yours\" was the first single Wonder produced on his own, and was also the first to feature his female backup singing group composed of Lynda Tucker Laurence (who went on to become a member of The Supremes), Syreeta Wright (who also co-wrote the song), and Venetta Fields. During a 2008 appearance on Friday Night with Jonathan Ross, Wonder credited the song title and chorus \"signed, sealed, delivered, I'm yours\" to his mother Lula, who exclaimed the words after listening to her son experiment with the melody. This song also marked Wonder's first Grammy nomination. The award went to Ronald Dunbar and General Johnson for writing the Clarence Carter song \"Patches\"."@en .

It was recorded by Johnny Cash on November 29, 1965 and included on his album Everybody Loves a Nut (1966). It was the album's third and most successful single (see 1966 in music), reaching number two on the U.S. Billboard Country Singles chart and forty-six on Billboard's Pop Singles chart. The song is a humorous criticism of musicians that put their political views into their music. It tells the story of a folk song group that is \"long on musical ability\", but ultimately breaks up due to political differences.At the end of the song, a warning is given not to mix politics with one's music. The punch line to the joke is that \"the guy in the rear\", is less easily labeled: he is a Methodist and he burned his driver's license (rather than his draft card), etc. Indeed, the song closes by stating that he got drafted. The song was covered, with a few lyrics slightly modified, by Canadian punk rock band Youth Youth Youth on their 1982 demo as well as their Repackaged (album) LP released in 1989 on Fringe Records. Noel Harrison sang the song on The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour on June 11, 1967. They ended the song by pointing out they had no \"guy in the rear\" and walked off."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"The Sun Always Shines on T.V.\" is a song by Norwegian pop rock music band A-ha. It was released as the third single from their hit debut album Hunting High and Low. In some commercial markets the single was not as popular as their previous (debut) single Take On Me, which had achieved #1 in the United States and several other countries around the world, but in the United Kingdom, and Ireland, it improved upon the #2 charting of Take On Me, reaching #1 on the UK Singles Chart for two weeks in January 1986, having been released there on 16 December 1985. Its success secured for the band the prestige of having achieved #1 single status in both the primary Anglo-American popular music charts on either side of the Atlantic. The song was re-released by the band as a live version in 2003 with some minor success in Eastern Europe. It has sold over 5 million copies worldwide."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"Walkin' After Midnight\" is a song written by Alan Block and Donn Hecht and recorded by American country music artist Patsy Cline. The song was originally given to pop singer Kay Starr; however, her label rejected it. The song was left unused until Hecht rediscovered it when writing for Four Star Records. Originally Cline was not fond of \"Walkin' After Midnight\", but after making a compromise with her label she recorded it. In January 1957, Cline performed the song on an episode of the CBS television program, Arthur Godfrey's Talent Scouts. It garnered a strong response from viewers and was therefore rush-released as a single February 11, 1957. \"Walkin' After Midnight\" became Cline's first major hit single, reaching No. 2 on the Billboard country music chart and No. 12 on its pop chart. Although the song was her only hit until 1961, the single version sold over one million copies and is often included on authoritative lists of the all-time greatest songs in country music."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"Happenin' All over Again\" is a song written and produced by Stock Aitken & Waterman for Lonnie Gordon's first album If I Have to Stand Alone (1991). It was released as the album's second single in January 1990 and reached #4 on the main UK singles chart. The song mixed Stock Aitken & Waterman's Europop sound with the blooming Italo house music which was becoming big in the UK charts at the time. This 1990 version was never released in the USA. The song had been originally written for Donna Summer, but due to a falling-out with the producers, she never recorded it and instead was given to Gordon. A different version of the song was included on Gordon's 1993 album Bad Mood. This version was released as a U.S. single in 1993 and peaked at #98 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, and also hit #1 on the U.S. Dance chart. Gordon re-recorded the song for a second time in 1998 and released it as a single."@en ;

A popular line from the song, \"My dear my dear my dear you do not know me but I know you very well now let me tell you,\" was also repeated in the same manner in \"Stutter\" with the only difference between the lines being that the words \"about the feelings I have for you\" were changed to \"that I caught you\" in \"Stutter.\" The group's four emcees, Bootie Brown, Slimkid3, Imani, and Fatlip, all use the track to recount schoolboy crushes which all eventually led to heartbreak.

	dbo:abstract	"\"This Ain't a Scene, It's an Arms Race\" is a song by American rock band Fall Out Boy and the lead single from their commercially successful third studio album Infinity on High (2007). The song officially debuted on November 21 at the American Music Awards and was shipped to radio stations that night (with an impact date of December 5 in the United States).[citation needed] The music was composed by vocalist and guitarist Patrick Stump and the lyrics were penned by bassist Pete Wentz, following the band's songwriting approach which first began with some songs on their 2003 album Take This to Your Grave. Production was handled by Neal Avron, who also produced the band's previous From Under the Cork Tree album. Commenting on the band's decision to pick the track as the first single, Wentz said \"There may be other songs on the record that would be bigger radio hits, but this one had the right message.\" The track was a commercial success and the band's major international breakthrough. \"This Ain't a Scene, It's an Arms Race\" debuted and peaked at No. 2 on the US Billboard Hot 100 with 162,000 first week sales and broke various records. It is the group's first single to chart worldwide in countries including Australia, New Zealand and most of the European nations, where it reached the top five in many. After its Platinum RIAA and ARIA certifications in 2007, in 2013 it was certified Silver by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) for 200,000 sales. In Australia, it spent nine consecutive weeks at either No. 4 or No. 5. The song was released as a downloadable track for the video game Rock Band on May 6, 2008, and is also on Rock Band Track Pack Volume 2. The January 2009 issue of PlayStation: The Official Magazine lists Fall Out Boy's \"This Ain't a Scene, It's an Arms Race\" as second on its list of Rock Band's Five Most Unexpectedly Rockin' Downloadable Songs.

	dbo:abstract	"\"Your Mama Don't Dance\" is a hit 1972 song by the rock duo Loggins and Messina. Released on their self-titled album Loggins and Messina, it reached #4 on the Billboard pop chart and #19 on the Billboard Easy Listening Chart as a single in early 1973. This song, whose refrain and first verse is done in a blues format, deals with the 1950s and 1960s lifestyle concerning the generation gap, where the parents oppose the Rock and Roll Revolution, of the younger generation, which includes the rebelliousness against the old society that monitors curfews on dating, as well as being arrested for making love with a girl in the back seat of a car, during a drive-in movie, which happens during the bridge section of the song. When released as a single, it was the duo's biggest hit as well as their only Gold single. \"Your Mama Don't Dance\" was covered in 1985 by the rock band Y&T, in 1988 by the rock band Poison, and it was the fourth single from their second album Open Up and Say...Ahh!. The Poison version released as a single in 1989 on Capitol Records reached number 10 on the Billboard Hot 100 and #39 on the Mainstream rock charts and has since gone Gold in the US. The song also charted at #21 on the Australian charts and #13 on the UK Singles chart. The single's B-side is \"Tearin' Down the Walls\". Elvis Presley covered it as a part of a medley on his 1974 live album Elvis: As Recorded Live on Stage in Memphis. The song was used as the title to a dance/reality competition series of the same name on Lifetime television network in 2008."@en ;

dbr:Another_Suitcase_in_Another_Hall	rdf:type	dbo:MusicalWork ;
	dbo:abstract	"\"Another Suitcase in Another Hall\" is a song recorded by Scottish singer Barbara Dickson, for the 1976 concept album, Evita, which contains songs from the musical of the same name. The musical was based on the life of Argentinian leader Eva Per\u00F3n. Written by Tim Rice and Andrew Lloyd Webber, the song is presented during a sequence where Eva throws out her husband's mistress on the streets. The latter sings the track, wondering about her future and coming to the conclusion that she would be fine. Dickson was enlisted by the songwriters to record the track after hearing her previous work. Rice and Webber asked her to record the song using a higher than usual pitch, so that she sounded younger like her character. Featuring instrumentation from guitar, marimba, harp and keyboard, \"Another Suitcase in Another Hall\" finds Dickson singing in a soprano voice. Critically appreciated, the song was released as a single on 7 February 1977, and reached number 18 on the UK Singles Chart. Dickson has stated that she did not like her recorded version of the track and employed a different arrangement during her future live renditions. The song has been covered and performed many times by other artists, namely Elaine Paige, Marti Webb, Kimberley Walsh from British girl group Girls Aloud, as well as actress Samantha Barks. Another notable version was recorded by American singer Madonna who played the part of Eva for the 1996 film adaptation of the musical. It was released on 3 March 1997, by Warner Bros. as the third and final single from the film's soundtrack. Unlike the musical, in the film the track was sung by Madonna's character instead of the mistress.

	dbo:abstract	"\"Crazy in Love\" is a song from American singer Beyonc\u00E9's 2003 debut solo album Dangerously in Love. Beyonc\u00E9 wrote the song with Rich Harrison, Jay Z, and Eugene Record, and produced it with Harrison. \"Crazy in Love\" is an R&B and pop love song that incorporates elements of hip hop, soul, and 1970s-style funk music. Its lyrics describe a romantic obsession that causes the protagonist to act out of character. Jay Z contributes a rapped verse to the song and is credited as a featured performer. The French horn-based hook samples \"Are You My Woman (Tell Me So),\" a 1970 song by the Chi-Lites. Columbia Records released \"Crazy in Love\" on May 18, 2003, as the lead single from Dangerously in Love. It was a number-one hit in the United States and United Kingdom, and achieved top-ten peaks on several other countries' record charts. With global sales of over 8.5 million, including 2 million from the U.S., it is one of the best-selling singles of all time. Music critics praised \"Crazy in Love\"'s hook, Jay Z's contribution, and Beyonc\u00E9's assertive delivery of the lyrics. VH1 declared it the greatest song of the 2000s decade, while Rolling Stone ranked it as the 118th best song of all time in 2010. At the 46th Grammy Awards, \"Crazy in Love\" won Best R&B Song and Best Rap/Sung Collaboration. The song's accompanying music video features Beyonc\u00E9 in various dance sequences. It won three awards at the 2003 MTV Video Music Awards, and its director, Jake Nava, won the Music Video Production Association award for Best R&B Video in 2004. Since 2003, \"Crazy in Love\" has been a staple in Beyonc\u00E9\u2019s live performances and concert tours. The American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers (ASCAP) recognized \"Crazy in Love\" as one of the most performed songs of 2004. Artists including David Byrne have covered the song, and it has been used in various television shows and other media."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"Cry Me a River\" is a song recorded by American singer and songwriter Justin Timberlake for his debut studio album, Justified (2002). It was written by Timberlake and Scott Storch with producer Timbaland and was inspired by Timberlake's former relationship with singer Britney Spears. Jive Records released the song to contemporary hit and rhythmic radio in the United States on November 25, 2002, as the album's second single. Accompanied by an electric piano, beatbox, guitars, synthesizers, Arabian-inspired riffs and Gregorian chants, \"Cry Me a River\" is a R&B song about a brokenhearted man who moves on from his last girlfriend, who had cheated on him with another man. The single received generally positive reviews from critics, who considered it a stand-out track on Justified and praised Timbaland's production. It won a Grammy Award for Best Male Pop Vocal Performance at the 2004 ceremony. The song peaked at number three on the US Billboard Hot 100 and Pop Songs charts and charted in the top ten in other countries. It was certified gold by the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) and silver by the Syndicat National de l'\u00C9dition Phonographique (SNEP). Filmmaker Francis Lawrence directed the music video for \"Cry Me a River\" in Malibu, California. In the video, Timberlake's character invades the home of his ex-lover and films himself having sexual relations with another woman. Spears alleged that the video was a publicity stunt, but Timberlake maintained that she did not inspire the production. The clip won the awards for Best Male Video and Best Pop Video at the 2003 MTV Video Music Awards. Timberlake performed \"Cry Me a River\" on his four major concert tours: The Justified World Tour (2003\u201304), Justified/Stripped Tour (2003), FutureSex/LoveShow (2007), and The 20/20 Experience World Tour (2013\u201315).

	dbo:abstract	"\"Drowned World/Substitute for Love\" is a song by American singer Madonna from her seventh studio album Ray of Light (1998). The song was written by Madonna, William Orbit, Rod McKuen, Anita Kerr and David Collins, while produced by Madonna and Orbit. Musically, the song is a pop ballad, which incorporates fused elements including trip hop, electronica and minor guitar riffs towards the end. The song samples the song \"Why I Follow the Tigers\" by The San Sebastian Strings. Lyrically, the song describes Madonna's spiritual transformation to seek authentic love over superficial dalliances. The song was released as the album's third single of the album on August 24, 1998, worldwide except in North America. \"Drowned World/Substitute for Love\" received positive reviews from music critics, who noted its restrained and mature out bring from the album and enjoyed the song as an opener to the album. Commercially, the song had generally modest success, peaking in the top ten in countries including Spain, Japan, Italy and the United Kingdom. Although the song was not released in North America, resulting it not to chart, the B-side single \"Sky Fits Heaven\" managed to chart at number 41 on the US Hot Dance Club Songs. An accompanying music video was released for the song, featuring Madonna running away from the paparazzi until she arrives at home. The video received controversy due to the scenes that feature Madonna being chased by paparazzi on motor-bikes, a scenario similar to Diana, Princess of Wales's death in 1997. The song was performed in two of Madonna's tours, these being the Drowned World Tour (2001) and the Confessions Tour (2006)."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"Holiday\" is a song by American singer Madonna from her eponymous debut studio album Madonna (1983). Sire Records released it as the album's third single on September 7, 1983. \"Holiday\" later appeared remixed on the remix compilation You Can Dance (1987) and the greatest hits compilation The Immaculate Collection (1990), and in its original form on the greatest hits album Celebration (2009). Written by Curtis Hudson and Lisa Stevens of Pure Energy, the track was offered to Madonna by her producer John \"Jellybean\" Benitez when she was looking for a potential hit track to include in her debut album. After accepting the song, she and Jellybean worked on it and altered its composition by the addition of a piano solo performed by their friend, Fred Zarr. \"Holiday\" features instrumentation from guitars, electronic handclaps, a cowbell, and a synthesized string arrangement, while its lyrics speak about the universal sentiment of taking a holiday. Universally acclaimed by critics, the song became Madonna's first hit single when it entered the top 20 of the Billboard Hot 100, topping its dance chart, and also becoming a crossover success, entering the top ten and top 40 of many European countries. Madonna has performed \"Holiday\" on most of her tours and it is generally included as a part of the encore. Different performances of the song are included in the recorded releases of her tours. Cover versions by a number of artists have been released, and it has also appeared in the soundtrack of sitcoms like Will & Grace. In the United Kingdom, \"Holiday\" has been released three times as a single; in January 1984, reaching number six, and in August 1985 reaching number 2 (only being kept from number one by her own single \"Into the Groove\"). Its third release in 1991 included new artwork to promote The Immaculate Collection with a limited edition EP titled The Holiday Collection, which contained tracks omitted from the compilation; this version peaked at number five. While not among Madonna's highest chart showings, the track became one of her better known songs worldwide."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"Into the Groove\" is a song by American singer Madonna from the 1985 film Desperately Seeking Susan. It was featured on the re-issue of her second studio album Like a Virgin (1984), and released on July 23, 1985, by Sire Records as the album's fourth single outside North America. The original song was included on her third greatest hits album, Celebration (2009), while remixes of it appeared on the remix compilation You Can Dance (1987), and her first greatest hits compilation The Immaculate Collection (1990). Madonna's inspiration behind the song was the dance floor, and she wrote it while watching a handsome Puerto Rican man, across her balcony. Initially written for her friend Mark Kamins, Madonna later decided to use it as the soundtrack of her film Desperately Seeking Susan. \"Into the Groove\" was recorded at Sigma Sound Studios. A remixed version, titled \"Into the Hollywood Groove\", was created by Madonna in 2003 for a Gap commercial and featured a rap by Missy Elliott. \"Into the Groove\" consists of instrumentation from synthesizers and drum machines. Madonna's voice is double tracked in the chorus; the song also consists of musical contrasts, overdubs, and Madonna's voice in lower register during the bridge. The lyrics of the song are simple, written as an invitation to dance with the singer. However, it carries sexual innuendos and undertones in the meaning. The song was appreciated by contemporary critics as well as authors, who frequently called it \"Madonna's first great single\". The song was a commercial success, reaching the top of the charts in Australia, Belgium, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Netherlands, New Zealand, Spain and the United Kingdom, where it was Madonna's first number-one single. In the United States, the song was only available as the B-side of the 12-inch single of \"Angel\", therefore it was ineligible to chart on the Billboard Hot 100 according to the rules at the time. By the end of the 1980s, \"Into the Groove\" was honored by Billboard magazine as the Dance Single of the Decade. A music video, consisting of clips from the film, was released to accompany the song. The song has been performed by Madonna in most of her concert tours, including the Sticky & Sweet Tour (2008\u201309), where she performed it while doing Double Dutch jump rope. \"Into the Groove\" has been covered by a number of artists, including Australian singer Dannii Minogue, who combined the song with her single \"Don't Wanna Lose This Feeling\"."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"Like a Virgin\" is a song by American singer Madonna. It is the title track from her second studio album Like a Virgin (1984), and was released on November 6, 1984 by Sire Records as the first single from the album. The song appears on the greatest hits compilation albums The Immaculate Collection (1990) and Celebration (2009). It was written by Billy Steinberg and Tom Kelly and produced by Nile Rodgers; Steinberg said that the song was inspired by his personal experiences of romance. \"Like a Virgin\" was chosen for Madonna by Michael Ostin of Warner Bros. Records after listening to a demo sung by Kelly. However, Rodgers initially felt that the song did not have a sufficient hook and was not suitable for Madonna, but subsequently changed his opinion after the hook was stuck in his mind. Musically \"Like a Virgin\" is a dance-oriented song, composed of two hooks. Madonna's voice is heard in a high register while a continuous arrangement of drums are heard along the bassline. The lyrics of the song are ambiguous and consist of hidden innuendo. In sexual terms, the lyrics can be interpreted in different ways for different people. \"Like a Virgin\" received positive reviews from contemporary as well as old critics, who frequently called it as one of the defining songs for Madonna. It became her first number-one single on the Billboard Hot 100, while reaching the top of the charts in Australia, Canada, and Japan, and the top-ten of the other countries. The music video portrayed Madonna sailing down the canals of Venice in a gondola, as well as roaming around a palace wearing a white wedding dress. With the video, scholars noted Madonna's portrayal of a sexually independent woman, the symbolism of the appearance of a man with lion's mask to that of Saint Mark, and compared the eroticism of the video to the vitality of the city of Venice. Madonna has performed the song in six of her concert tours, most recent being the Rebel Heart Tour in 2015. Most of the time, her performances of \"Like a Virgin\" were associated with strong reaction and uproar from the media. \"Like a Virgin\" has been covered by a number of artists and has appeared or referenced in feature films such as Reservoir Dogs, Moulin Rouge! and Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason. Family groups sought to ban it as they believed the song promoted sex without marriage. On the other hand, Madonna's public persona of an indomitable, sexually unashamed, supremely confident woman was widely accepted by the younger generation who emulated her style and fashion. Scholars have credited \"Like a Virgin\" as the song which cemented her position as a pop culture icon."@en ;

Minogue co-wrote the track with James Dean Bradfield and Sean More while Bradfield and Dave Eringa produced it. Backed by guitar and drum instruments, \"Some Kind of Bliss\" is a pop rock track in which Minogue sings about feeling happy while away from family and friends. Critical response to \"Some Kind of Bliss\" was mostly mixed; earlier reviews were critical towards her image and sound transition to rock music, while retrospective reviews are positive towards her songwriting and sonic experimentation. \"Some Kind of Bliss\" performed relatively poorly on international charts peaking at number twenty-seven on the Australian Singles Chart, at 22 on the UK Singles Chart (her first solo release to miss the UK Top 20) and reaching number 46 on the New Zealand Singles Chart. To promote \"Some Kind of Bliss\", she performed the track on Top of the Pops, MTV Australia live and the Australian TV series Hey Hey It's Saturday.

	dbo:abstract	"\"Hunter\" is a song by Icelandic musician Bj\u00F6rk from her fourth studio album, Homogenic (1997). The lyrics of \"Hunter\" explore the pressure Bj\u00F6rk felt to write music after realising the workforce that depended on her, following the success she found as a solo artist with her previous studio albums. The first time the song saw the light of day was at the 1997 Tibetan Freedom Concert and later with the online promotional release of Homogenic; the track was subsequently released as the third single for the album as three different CD releases in October 1998. A collaborative effort between Bj\u00F6rk and Mark Bell, \"Hunter\" features a dark combination of strings and layered synths, a militaristic electronic beat, and enigmatic lyrics about the heading towards a mission. Most commentators were enticed by \"Hunter\", which they declared one of the highlights of the Homogenic album. The single performed poorly at the music charts, it peaked at number forty-four on the UK Singles Chart and number fifty-five on the French Singles Chart. The song was included in the compilation album Greatest Hits (2002), whose tracks were selected by fans through a survey. The accompanying music video of \"Hunter\" was directed by longtime collaborator Paul White of Me Company and consists of a close-up of a bald Bj\u00F6rk as she transforms into an \"techno-bear\" while singing. Seeking to convey the music's fusion of organic and technological, the polar bear was animated in a non-naturalistic fashion; the bear also embodies the ferocious hunter the lyrics represent. The song's video garnered acclaim from critics. Bj\u00F6rk has performed \"Hunter\" on Later... with Jools Holland and in five of her tours, the most recent being the Vulnicura Tour."@en ;

ns33:Childhood	rdf:type	dbo:MusicalWork ;
	dbo:abstract	"\"Scream\"/\"Childhood\" is the lead single from Michael Jackson's ninth studio album, HIStory: Past, Present and Future, Book I. The A-side of the single, \"Scream\", is a duet with his younger sister Janet Jackson, while the corresponding B-side, \"Childhood\", is a solo piece. The single was released on May 31, 1995. \"Scream\" is cited primarily as an aggressive, retaliatory song directed at the tabloid media and their coverage of the child sexual abuse accusations made against Michael Jackson in 1993. \"Scream\" was written, composed and produced by Jimmy Jam, Terry Lewis, Michael Jackson and Janet Jackson; Michael played many of the instruments. It incorporates elements of pop, R&B, electrorock, new jack swing, dance-pop, and funk. Recording for Scream took place at the Hit Factory in New York City in October 1994 and at Flyte Tyme Studios in Edina, Minnesota in December 1994. The song was leaked to radio stations early, despite Epic Records' attempt to keep it off air until the official release date. Generally well received amongst critics, it has been compared favorably to other accomplished pieces by Michael Jackson. It went on to be nominated for a Grammy Award and an American Music Award. The corresponding music video remains one of his most critically acclaimed pieces; it won numerous MTV Video Music Awards and a Grammy. At a cost of $7 million, it was listed in the Guinness World Records as the most expensive music video ever made; however, director Mark Romanek has refuted the claim, saying that there were two other music videos from the same era which cost \"millions more\" than the video for \"Scream\". The imagery in \"Scream\" has been replicated in several contemporary pieces, including \"No Scrubs\" (1999) by TLC, \"Shawty Get Loose\" (2008) by Lil Mama, \"Stay the Night\" (1999) by IMx, \"Walkin' on the Moon\" (2009) by The-Dream, and \"I'm Out\" by Ciara featuring Nicki Minaj (2013). \"Childhood\" is an auto-biographical song written and composed by Michael Jackson. The theme of the track centers around his difficult childhood experiences. It would become the main theme song for Free Willy 2: The Adventure Home, continuing his association with the Free Willy series. The track appeared on several compilation albums, but was met with a mixed reception amongst critics. The song's music video, which had little in common with the supporting film, has been critically praised. \"Scream\"/\"Childhood\" would become the first single in the 37-year history of Billboard to debut at number five on the Billboard Hot 100, where it peaked. It was a worldwide hit, reaching the top five in the vast majority of major music markets. Michael performed \"Scream\" on his 1996\u201397 HIStory World Tour. Following his death in 2009, Janet performed the song on her 2011 Number Ones: Up Close and Personal World Tour as a tribute to him as well as on her 2015-2016 Unbreakable World Tour."@en ;

The first version of the song was produced by Bobby Orlando and was released on Columbia Records' Bobcat Records imprint in April 1984, becoming a club hit in the United States and some European countries. After the duo signed with EMI, the song was re-recorded with producer Stephen Hague for their first studio album, Please. In October 1985, the new version was released, reaching number one in the United Kingdom and the United States in 1986. In 1987, the song won Best Single at the Brit Awards, and Best International Hit at the Ivor Novello Awards. In 2005, 20 years after its release, the song was awarded Song of The Decade between the years 1985 and 1994 by the British Academy of Composers and Songwriters. In 2015 the song was voted by the British public as the nation's 12th favourite 1980s number one in a poll for ITV. The song was performed by Pet Shop Boys at the 2012 Summer Olympics closing ceremony and was included as part of the soundtrack of the 2013 game Grand Theft Auto V on the Non-Stop-Pop radio station."@en ;

The song is often incorrectly attributed to J-pop star Ayumi Hamasaki. This error may be due to the ambiency style, production and voice. Also, the voices of both singers are quite similar. The error may also be due to the song being incorrectly attributed to Ayumi Hamasaki and distributed via P2P networks in the late '90s.

	dbo:abstract	"\"Joyride\" is a song by the Swedish rock duo Roxette. Written by Per Gessle, the song was released as the lead single from their third studio album, Joyride (1991), the follow-up to the duo's highly successful second studio album, Look Sharp! (1988). The single topped the charts across Europe and in Australia, Canada, and the United States, where it spent one week at number one on the Billboard Hot 100, their last to do so, in May 1991. In the UK, \"Joyride\" peaked at #4. In interviews, Gessle states he got the idea for the opening line of this song from his girlfriend (now wife) who left a note on his piano that stated, \"Hello, you fool, I love you.\" In the opening section of the song, a man is heard saying \"Come on, join the joyride everybody, get your tickets here, step right this way\"; the man who says this is Roxette's old tour manager and long-time friend Dave Edwards. This is an homage to The Beatles' song \"Magical Mystery Tour\", on which, during the opening section, Paul McCartney is heard saying \"Roll up, roll up for the Magical Mystery Tour! Step right this way!\" In the liner notes of Don't Bore Us, Get to the Chorus!, Gessle calls \"Joyride\" Roxette's \"Magical Mystery Tour\", and says he took the title from an interview in which Paul McCartney called writing songs with John Lennon a \"long joyride\". In 1991, Alvin and the Chipmunks and The Chipettes covered the song for their album The Chipmunks Rock the House. During the 1994 Stanley Cup playoffs this became the intro anthem to the Vancouver Canucks as they took the ice before each game."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"One\" is a song by the Irish rock band U2. It is the third track from their 1991 album Achtung Baby, and it was released as the record's third single in March 1992. During the album's recording sessions at Hansa Studios in Berlin, conflict arose between the band members over the direction of U2's sound and the quality of their material. Tensions almost prompted the band to break up until they achieved a breakthrough with the improvisation of \"One\"; the song was written after the band members were inspired by a chord progression that guitarist the Edge was playing in the studio. The lyrics, written by lead singer Bono, were inspired by the band members' fractured relationships and the German reunification. Although the lyrics ostensibly describe \"disunity\", they have been interpreted in other ways. \"One\" was released as a benefit single, with proceeds going towards AIDS research. The song topped the Irish Singles Charts and US Billboard Album Rock Tracks and Modern Rock Tracks charts, and it peaked at number seven on the UK Singles Chart and number ten on the Billboard Hot 100. In promotion of the song, the band filmed several music videos, although they were not pleased until a third was created. The song was acclaimed by critics upon its release, and it has since been featured in polls of the greatest songs of all time. U2 has performed \"One\" at all but one of their tour concerts since the song's live debut in 1992, and it has appeared in many of the band's concert films. In a live setting, \"One\" is often used by the group to promote human rights or social justice causes, and the song lends its namesake to Bono's charitable organisation, the ONE Campaign. In 2005, U2 re-recorded the song as part of a duet with R&B recording artist Mary J. Blige on her album The Breakthrough."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"Passion\" is a song recorded by Japanese recording artist and songwriter Utada Hikaru for her fourth studio album Ultra Blue (2004). The song was used as the theme song for the 2005 video game Kingdom Hearts II. The song was written, composed and produced by Utada herself, while additional production was handled by Teruzane Utada and Akira Miyake. Utada had written and composed the song when she was approached to record another song for the Kingdom Hearts series, which she had contributed previously on the first video game. It also made an appearance on her 2010 greatest hits compilations: Utada Hikaru Single Collection Vol. 2 and Utada the Best. Spoken in both English and Japanese language, the lyrical content depicts the events of past, present and future and incorporates themes of love, hope and safety; When she accepted the offer to record the track, she found it difficult to write a Japanese-worded version of the \"Sanctuary\". \"Passion\" and \"Sanctuary\" received critical praise from contemporary music critics, who found it her most experimental track to date. Critics praised her vocal delivery and commended the production values, in contrast on her 2009 album This Is the One. Commercially, \"Passion\" had suffered in Japan for being Utada's first Japanese single to miss the top spot on the Oricon chart. The song peaked at number four on the Japanese Oricon Singles, her lowest charting single and her first single to miss the top three position, but eventually tied with her 2006 single \"Boku wa Kuma\". The accompanying music video for the single \"Passion\" was issued for the single as well, directed by Kazuaki Kiriya. The video features scenes of anime culture that represents the image of Utada herself and features Utada in a grand hall, shot all by green screening effects and finishes with a paddock of running horses. During production, Utada had compared the video, choreography and set to 1997 animated action-fantasy film Princess Mononoke. The video was positively received by critics for its comparison sets to the video game, but received minor criticism for the lack of video game inspiration and footage."@en ;

The video for \"Puss\" showed a man being welded in a chair, so it was banned from some television stations. \"Oh, the Guilt\" was recorded by Barrett Jones on April 7, 1992 in Seattle, Washington. The song was re-released in 2004 on the Nirvana rarities box set, With the Lights Out, and in 2005 on the compilation album, Sliver: The Best of the Box, although on these latter releases the song was remixed by Adam Kasper, and does not include the sound of lighter clicks present on the original mix."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"Revolution\" is a song by the Beatles, written by John Lennon and credited to Lennon\u2013McCartney. Two versions of the song were recorded in 1968: a hard rock version, released as the B-side of the \"Hey Jude\" single, and a slower, bluesier arrangement (titled \"Revolution 1\") for the Beatles' self-titled double album, commonly known as \"the White Album\". Although the single version was issued first, it was recorded several weeks after \"Revolution 1\", as a re-make specifically intended for release as a single. A third connected piece, written by Lennon, is the experimental track \"Revolution 9\", based the latter parts of the same performance that produced \"Revolution 1\", and which also appears on the White Album. Inspired by political protests in early 1968, Lennon's lyrics expressed doubt in regard to some of the tactics. When the single version was released in August, the political left viewed it as betraying their cause. The release of the album version in November indicated Lennon's uncertainty about destructive change, with the phrase \"count me out\" recorded differently as \"count me out, in\". In 1987, the song became the first Beatles recording to be licensed for a television commercial, which prompted a lawsuit from the surviving members of the group. In the same year Nina Simone recorded her single Revolution with some structural similarities (some lyrics are also the same) to the Beatles' song, but credited to her and Weldon Irvine."@en ;

The single was released as the third single from that album in and Australia on the 7 November 2006. A digital EP was released to the American iTunes Store in December 2006. It was subsequently released as a CD and 7\" vinyl single in the UK on the 5 March 2007. The song was written by Nic to comfort his family after his father's death. He is quoted as saying \"It was inevitable I would write a song that dealt with all of that, but it was almost too big a subject for me to handle,\" Nic also says. \"Then I got a phone call from my mum saying everyone was depressed so I wrote the song through Dad's eyes, what he would say to help everyone through. We recorded it in one take, but it was emotional, very heavy. We couldn't be happier with this album.\" The title of the song is speculated to be in homage to \"Shine On You Crazy Diamond\", a similarly themed song by Pink Floyd, though this has not been confirmed. Similarly, the refrain of \"Shine on, for everyone\" is reminiscent of \"Instant Karma!\", a song by John Lennon. The song was featured on the final episode of the television series The O.C. and also in a season final episode of Cold Case. The song was also in a first season episode of Brothers & Sisters. In a recent interview with Heat magazine, the comedy chathost declared, \"I love this song. I would be more than delighted to hear it through my coffin!\"[citation needed] The song charted poorly in Australia only reaching #54 on the singles charts, similarly in the UK it only reached #114. The song failed to chart in the United States but it did chart on the Modern Rock charts at #30.

It was written by Avril Lavigne and The Matrix (Scott Spock, Lauren Christy, and Graham Edwards), and produced by The Matrix. The song is a power pop and pop punk track, which lyrically, tells a story told from the singer's viewpoint about her rocker boyfriend and a girl he knew in high school who rejected him because he was a skateboarder and she was a snob. The song received critical appreciation, with most commending its hook, calling the song \"funny\" and \"clever\". It also received a Grammy nomination for Best Female Rock Vocal Performance at the 2003 edition. Commercially, \"Sk8er Boi\" was a success, reaching the top-ten in more than ten countries, such as Australia, New Zealand, the United Kingdom and the United States (becoming Lavigne's second top ten single on the Billboard Hot 100 chart). The music video for the song, directed by Francis Lawrence, features a concert on a city street with Lavigne singing on the hood of a car with a crowd rocking out around her. It was a success on TRL and was voted one of the best music videos of the decade by BT TV.

Wylde insists that it is not autobiographical and that if any girl were to treat him like that, he would simply break up with her. The video was directed by Rob Zombie, featuring his signature style of blue lighting, zombies, and a regular female cameo, Rob Zombie's wife Sheri Moon Zombie. The idea came together while touring together on Ozzfest.

One of the first songs Norwood and Timbaland collaborated on, the record is an uptempo\u2013offbeat contemporary R&B song with pop and dance-pop elements, built along on a flute, Afro-Caribbean music influences and 1980s electro sounds. Considered by Norwood as one of her favorites on the album, the track expresses a female's addictive passion for a special person, whom she declares her very own aphrodisiac. The song was met with generally positive reviews from contemporary critics. Many praised Norwood's versatility and considered it as one of the stand-out tracks on Afrodisiac for having an innovative and different production when compared to the others. Released as the album's second international single in Europe and Oceania during the third and fourth quarter of 2004, \"Afrodisiac\" reached number eleven on the UK Singles Chart, its highest peak, as well as the top thirty in France and Ireland, and the top forty in Australia and Switzerland, where it surpassed the success of its predecessor. The single's music video was directed by Matthew Rolston and marked his second collaboration with Norwood following their 1995 video for \"Best Friend\". Choreographed by Laurieann Gibson, it was filmed in Los Angeles, California and features Norwood dancing in a water-flooded outtrack world, influenced by white, gold and black color. \"Afrodisiac\" was performed on a few television shows, such as CD:UK, Top of the Pops, and Billboard Live, but has since been performed frequently on one of Norwood's concerts and tours, including the 2004 MOBO Awards and the 2009 Human World Tour."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"Confessions Part II\" is a song by R&B singer Usher, produced by Jermaine Dupri and Bryan-Michael Cox for Usher's fourth album Confessions. Written by Usher, Dupri and Cox, the song is a confession of a man to his woman about his impregnated mistress, a continuation of \"Confessions Part I\" which relates to a man's infidelity. Its personal content evoked rumors and early responses from the public even before its release, believing that Usher was asserting the truth; however, Dupri divulged that the story behind the album is his and Usher explained that he only took inspiration from his friends' similar experiences. \"Confessions Part II\" received mixed reviews from critics. The song was released as the third single from the album, following the success of \"Burn\". The single reached number one on Billboard Hot 100 for two weeks, becoming the album's third consecutive number-one single. Internationally, the single had lesser success than the album's previous releases."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"Date Rape\" is a song by the band Sublime originally recorded for their 1992 debut album, 40 Oz. to Freedom. It was first released as a single in 1991, but did not become a hit until four years later, when the Los Angeles radio station KROQ began adding it into their playlists and it quickly became one of their most requested songs. Bradley Nowell explained, Humorous in tone, the song ends with the victimizer being sent to prison and being humiliatingly anally raped by a larger inmate. Although \"Date Rape\" is one of Sublime's most popular songs, it barely made it on their first CD. Nowell and the other members of the band thought of it as one of their worst songs. They were often reluctant to play it during live shows when fans screamed out requests for it. Pornographic actor Ron Jeremy stars in the \"Date Rape\" music video. Jeremy plays both the judge at the rape trial and the \"large inmate\" who rapes the man who sexually assaulted the female protagonist of the song. The song was covered by Fishbone (who Sublime cited as an influence) on the 2005 Sublime tribute album entitled Look at All the Love We Found for which a music video was directed by Renee Tod and Josh Fischel (of the band Bargain Music). Fischel is the director of the Sublime documentary Stories, Tales, Lies & Exaggerations. The song also appeared on Fishbone's 2006 album Still Stuck in Your Throat."@en ;

The Alan Moulder Mix featured as the opening track for the European version of Gran Turismo 3: A-Spec. It was first released on the \"Seven Days in the Sun\" single as a B-side. It was released as a single as it was included on the Gran Turismo soundtrack; it is a common misconception that \"pressure from fans\" was the reason.[citation needed] Despite having already appeared in the top 20 earlier in the year as a B-side, the single A-side release stayed in the top 20 for 4 weeks, peaking at number 12. It instantly became a regular to end the band's live sets, but has been occasionally rested from this position for a cover of \"Breed\" by Nirvana, while never used as one of the \"Feeder covers\" at Renegades gigs. \"Just a Day\" has sold over 100,000 downloads and physical copies combined. Feeder's performance of \"Just a Day\" on CD:UK in December 2001 was Feeder's last with Jon Lee. The week Jon Lee died, the band were due to appear on Top of the Pops performing \"Can't Stand Losing You\", a cover of The Police which appears on CD1 of this EP.

	dbo:abstract	"\"Liar\" is a song by the British rock band Queen, written by the lead singer Freddie Mercury in 1970, and originally titled \"Lover\". The song featured on the band's 1973 debut album Queen. A heavily truncated version of \"Liar\" was released as a single \u2014backed with \"Doing All Right\" \u2014 in the United States by Elektra Records in February 1974. In the band's early years, \"Liar\" was a concert staple, performed as a conclusion to their main set and often lasting for up to ten minutes. However, over time the song eventually fell off the setlist, with the exception of The Works Tour (though the song was cut down to three minutes or less). \"Liar\" was referenced in the setlist of the Magic Tour, as Brian May played a partial guitar riff from the song immediately before \"Tear it Up\". During live performances, it was a notable case where John Deacon mimed singing backing vocals - namely, he stood behind Mercury and sang into his microphone, for the \"all day long\" section of the song. This is replicated in the song's promotional video, shot in 1973. Seemingly, Deacon only mouthed the words in live performances, as his voice cannot be heard here on any recording, official or bootlegged. The choice to only mime singing along was presumably a result of Deacon's admitted weaker singing ability. The song also contains a bass solo performed by Deacon, the most substantial solo he ever performed live. As confirmed by the transcription on EMI Music Publishing's Off The Record sheet music for the song, this is one of three Queen tracks, the others being \"Now I'm Here\" and \"Under Pressure\" (their collaboration originally with David Bowie), to feature a Hammond organ. This song briefly brought up the issue of songwriting credits within the band. Brian May queried which band members would be credited for developing the music for each song, to which Freddie Mercury concluded the discussion, stating that the lyricist, or otherwise the individual who originates the song, should be credited as its writer, a practice that continued until \"The Miracle\"."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'\" is a song by American recording artist Michael Jackson. Released on May 8, 1983, by Epic Records, \"Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'\" was the fourth single from Jackson's sixth studio album Thriller (1982). The opening track of the album, it was written, composed and co-produced by Jackson, and was produced by Quincy Jones. The song's lyrics pertain to strangers spreading rumors to start an argument for no good reason. Musically, \"Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'\" evokes the disco sound of Jackson's previous studio album, Off the Wall, released in 1979. The song is characterized by a complex rhythm arrangement and a distinctive horn arrangement. \"Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'\" has been covered and sampled by multiple recording artists since its release. Aside from Thriller, the song appears on multiple compilation and greatest hits albums by Jackson. \"Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'\" was generally well received by contemporary music critics. The song was also commercially successful, charting within the top 20 and top 30 in several countries. It became Jackson's fifth consecutive top 10 single in the United States on the Billboard Hot 100, peaking at number five, and later re-entered charts in 2008 after the release of Thriller 25. Following Jackson's death in June 2009, the song re-entered music charts worldwide, mainly due to digital download sales. Unlike previous singles from Thriller, \"Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'\" did not have a music video to accompany it, but was performed by Jackson on world concert tours, as both a member of The Jacksons and as a solo artist. As part of the release of Thriller 25, a remix of \"Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'\", entitled \"Wanna Be Startin' Somethin' 2008 with Akon\", was recorded with Akon, and released as the second single from the album. The song was commercially successful, mainly charting within the top 10 in six countries, as well as the top 20 in several territories worldwide and top 40 in Canada. The song was more successful internationally than in the United States, having peaked on the Billboard Hot 100 at number 81, which was the song's lowest charting position."@en ;

In the United States, it debuted at number eight on the Billboard Hot 100, their first top ten hit in the country, and their most successful song until \"Viva la Vida\" reached number one in 2008. \"Speed of Sound\" was recognised Song of the Year by the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers (ASCAP) and it was nominated twice at the 48th Grammy Awards.

	dbo:abstract	"\"Anytime You Need a Friend\" is a song by American singer-songwriter Mariah Carey. The song was written and produced by Carey and Walter Afanasieff, for her third studio album, Music Box (1993). It was released on May 31, 1994 through Columbia Records, as the fourth and final single from the album. The song is influenced by pop, R&B and gospel music genres. While the album focused heavily on pop oriented and radio friendly material, \"Anytime You Need a Friend\" deviated from the formula, finishing as the only gospel-infused song on Music Box. Lyrically, the song's protagonist tells her love interest that anytime he may need a friend, she will be there unconditionally for him. Throughout the song's bridge and climax, critics noted the lyrics altering from those of a friend, to those of a lover. The song was well received by contemporary music critics, many of which praised Carey's large spanning vocal range, as well as its gospel influence that they felt was missing on most of Music Box. Aside from its critical acceptance, the song achieved strong worldwide chart positions and peaked at number twelve on the US Billboard Hot 100, but became her first single to miss out the top-ten. Additionally, it peaked at number five in Canada and topped the singles charts in Finland and the Netherlands. The song attained a top-twenty peak position in Australia, France, Ireland, New Zealand, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. Carey performed \"Anytime You Need a Friend\" live on several televised talk and award shows around the world, including the Late Show with David Letterman, the British music chart program Top of the Pops and German entertainment show Wetten, dass..?. Additionally, the song served as a closing number on Carey's Music Box and Daydream World Tours, and was featured on her compilation albums, Greatest Hits (2001) and The Ballads (2008). Although several remixes were commissioned for the song, the C+C remix became the most notable, being produced by C+C Music Factory's David Cole and Robert Clivill\u00E9s, and the first of Carey's remixes to feature her on production credits. The song's music video was filmed by Danielle Federici, in New York during the summer of 1994. The video was filmed in black-and-white fashion, and features Carey's first image makeover, where she appears with a straightened hairstyle for the first time in her career. Additionally, the music video showcases scenes of Carey singing by a large church choir in a foyer, as well as several people, ranging from a small child to an elderly man, who are alone and depressed. As the video progresses, the child and man are befriended after brief interludes and prayers to God. The song's C+C remix also features its own music video, displaying behind the scenes footage of Carey and her staff enjoying themselves during the original video's filming."@en ;

dbr:Talk_About_Our_Love	rdf:type	dbo:MusicalWork ;
	dbo:abstract	"\"Talk About Our Love\" is a song by American recording artist Brandy Norwood, taken from her fourth studio album, Afrodisiac (2004). It was written by Kanye West, who also appears as a featured artist on it, and Harold Lilly, while production was handled by the former. Due to the song's use of a sample of Mandrill's 1978 song \"Gilly Hines,\" penned by band members Claude Cave II, and Carlos, Louis and Ricardo Wilson, they are also credited as writers. Lyrically, \"Talk About Our Love\" is about a relationship that lacks support by family and friends; the music consists of an arrangement using a bass, keyboards, drums, and string instruments, the latter of which were provided by Israeli violinist Miri Ben-Ari. Recorded late into the production of the album, the track was an eleventh hour addition to the album's track listing alongside \"Where You Wanna Be.\" It was eventually selected as the album's lead single in a last-minute decision and thus replaced the Timbaland-crafted song \"Black Pepper,\" resulting in his dissociation of the Afrodisiac project. Released to generally positive reviews by critics during the second quarter of 2004, \"Talk About Our Love\" became a moderate chart success around the globe. While it peaked at number six on the UK Singles Chart, the song reached the top thirty in Australia, Ireland, and the Netherlands, but barely made it to the top forty on the US Billboard Hot 100. \"Talk About Our Love\" was promoted on several shows such as The Tonight Show with Jay Leno, CD:UK and Today and later included in the encore set of her 2009 Human World Tour. Its accompanying music video was directed by Dave Meyers, based on a concept by West. It portrays Norwood and the rapper as a couple who is frequently disturbed by nosy friends and neighbours, who keep on popping in and out of their house to find out about their affairs. At the 2004 MTV Video Music Awards, Norwood garnered a nomination in the Best R&B Video category for her work in the clip though she eventually lost to Alicia Keys' \"If I Ain't Got You\". Additionally, the song received a Best Collaboration nod at the 2004 MOBO Awards."@en ;

It was written and composed by Jackson and produced by him and Quincy Jones. There are contradictory claims on the meaning of the song's lyrics. One suggests that they are derived from a real-life experience, in which a female fan claimed that Jackson (or one of his brothers) had fathered one of her twins. However, Jackson himself stated that \"Billie Jean\" was based on groupies he had encountered. The song is well known for its distinctive bassline played by Louis Johnson and Jackson's vocal hiccups. The song was mixed 91 times by audio engineer Bruce Swedien before it was finalized. The song became a worldwide commercial and critical success; it was one of the best-selling singles of 1983 and is one of the best-selling singles worldwide. The song topped both the US and UK charts simultaneously. In other countries, it topped the charts of Switzerland and reached the top ten in Austria, Italy, New Zealand, Norway and Sweden. \"Billie Jean\" was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) in 1989. Rolling Stone magazine placed the song in the 58th spot on its list of The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time. Awarded numerous honours\u2014including two Grammy Awards, one American Music Award, and an induction into the Music Video Producers Hall of Fame\u2014the song and corresponding music video helped propel Thriller to the status of best-selling album of all time. The song was promoted with a short film that broke down MTV's racial barrier as the first video by a black artist to be aired in heavy rotation. Also, Jackson's Emmy-nominated performance on Motown 25: Yesterday, Today, Forever, in which Jackson premiered his \"moonwalk\", helped to popularize the song. It was additionally promoted through Jackson's Pepsi commercials; during the filming of one commercial, Jackson's scalp was severely burned. Covered by modern artists, \"Billie Jean\" sealed Jackson's status as an international pop icon."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"A Whiter Shade of Pale\" is the debut single by the English rock band Procol Harum, released 12 May 1967. The record reached number one in the UK Singles Chart on 8 June 1967, and stayed there for six weeks. Without much promotion, it reached No. 5 on the US charts. One of the counterculture anthems of the 1967 Summer of Love, it is one of fewer than 30 singles to have sold over 10 million copies worldwide. With its Bach-derived instrumental melody, soulful vocals, and unusual lyrics, written by the song's co-authors Gary Brooker, Keith Reid, and organist Matthew Fisher, \"A Whiter Shade of Pale\" reached No. 1 in several countries when released in 1967. In the years since, it has become an enduring classic. As of 2009, it was the most played song in the last 75 years in public places in the United Kingdom, and the UK performing rights group Phonographic Performance Limited in 2004 recognised it as the most-played record by British broadcasting of the past 70 years. Also in 2004, Rolling Stone placed \"A Whiter Shade of Pale\" No. 57 on its list of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time. In 1977, the song was named joint winner (along with Queen's \"Bohemian Rhapsody\") of the Best British Pop Single 1952\u20131977 at the Brit Awards. In 1998 the song was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame. More than 1000 recorded cover versions by other artists are known. The song has been included in many music compilations over the decades and has also been used in the soundtracks of numerous films, including The Big Chill, Purple Haze, Breaking the Waves, The Boat That Rocked, Oblivion, and in Martin Scorsese's segment of New York Stories. Cover versions of the song have also been featured in many films, for example by King Curtis in Withnail and I and by Annie Lennox in The Net. The original writing credits were for Brooker and Reid only. On 30 July 2009, Matthew Fisher won co-writing credit for adding the organ parts to the original music in a unanimous ruling from the Law Lords."@en ;

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Can\u0027t_Get_You_Out_of_My_Head>	rdf:type	dbo:MusicalWork ;
	dbo:abstract	"\"Can't Get You Out of My Head\" is a song recorded by Australian singer Kylie Minogue for her eighth studio album Fever (2001). The song was released in Australia by Parlophone as the lead single from the album on 8 September 2001. It was released on 17 September 2001 in the United Kingdom. In the United States, the single was released on 18 February 2002. Written and produced by Cathy Dennis and Rob Davis, \"Can't Get You Out of My Head\" is a midtempo dance-pop song which lyrically details Minogue's obsession towards her lover. The song is famous for its \"la la la\" hook. In addition to positive reviews from music critics, \"Can't Get You Out of My Head\" found commercial success on a large scale. It peaked at number one on the charts of Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Poland, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and every other European country excluding Finland. It also topped the charts of Minogue's native country Australia, Canada and New Zealand. In the United States, the song peaked at number seven on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart, becoming Minogue's biggest hit in the region since \"The Loco-Motion\". \"Can't Get You Out of My Head\" reportedly reached number one in 40 countries across the globe. It was certified triple-platinum in Australia, double-platinum in the United Kingdom, and gold in the United States. It became Minogue's first single to sell in excess of one million copies in the United Kingdom, where it also stands as the 28th best-selling single of the millennium. As of 2013, the song is Minogue's highest selling single and one of the best-selling singles of all time, with worldwide sales exceeding seven million. The accompanying music video for the song was directed by Dawn Shadforth, and features Minogue performing various dance routines in different futuristic backdrops. It became notable for the revealing hooded white jumpsuit Minogue wore during one of the scenes. The song has been performed by Minogue during all of her concert tours as of 2013, with the exception of the Anti Tour. Following its release, \"Can't Get You Out of My Head\" ranked on a number of decade-end lists compiled by magazines such as the Rolling Stone, The Guardian, and NME. It is considered to be Minogue's strongest commercial breakthrough in the United States and is said to have been the reason behind the success of its parent album Fever in the region. \"Can't Get You Out of My Head\" is also recognised as Minogue's signature song and was a defining point in her musical career. In 2012, the song was re-recorded for inclusion in Minogue's orchestral compilation album The Abbey Road Sessions."@en ;

dbr:Fairytale_of_New_York	rdf:type	dbo:MusicalWork ;
	dbo:abstract	"\"Fairytale of New York\" is a Christmas song written by Jem Finer and Shane MacGowan and first released as a single on 23 November 1987 by their band The Pogues, featuring singer-songwriter Kirsty MacColl on vocals. The song was written as a duet, with the Pogues' singer MacGowan taking the role of the male character and MacColl the female character. It is an Irish folk-style ballad, and featured on The Pogues' 1988 album If I Should Fall from Grace with God. Originally begun in 1985, the song had a troubled two year development history, undergoing rewrites and aborted attempts at recording, and losing its original female vocalist along the way, before finally being completed in summer 1987. Although the single never reached number one in the UK Singles Chart, being kept at number two on its original release in 1987 by the Pet Shop Boys' cover version of \"Always on My Mind\", it has since proved enduringly popular with both music critics and the public: to date the song has reached the UK top twenty on twelve separate occasions since its original release in 1987, including every year since 2005, and was certified platinum in the UK in 2013. The song has sold 1.18 million copies in the UK as of November 2015. In the UK it is the most-played Christmas song of the 21st century. \"Fairytale of New York\" has been cited as the best Christmas song of all time in various television, radio and magazine related polls in the UK and Ireland."@en ;

The US release became their first hit single, being certified Gold on 13 April 1970, having sold one million copies. It reached number one in Germany, and number four in the Netherlands. Parts of the song were adapted from Willie Dixon's \"You Need Love\", recorded by Muddy Waters in 1962; originally uncredited to Dixon, a lawsuit in 1985 was settled with a payment to Dixon and credit on subsequent releases. In 2004, the song was ranked number 75 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time, and in March 2005, Q magazine placed \"Whole Lotta Love\" at number three in its list of the 100 Greatest Guitar Tracks. It was placed 11 on a similar list by Rolling Stone. In 2009 it was named the third greatest hard rock song of all time by VH1. Already part of their live repertoire, \"Whole Lotta Love\" saw its first official release on the LP Led Zeppelin II on 22 October 1969 (Atlantic LP #8236).

dbr:Thank_God_I_Found_You	rdf:type	dbo:MusicalWork ;
	dbo:abstract	"\"Thank God I Found You\" is a song by American singer-songwriter Mariah Carey. It features guest vocals from R&B singer Joe and American boy band 98 Degrees. Written and produced by Carey along with Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis, the song was released on January 25, 2000, through Columbia Records as the second single from her seventh studio album, Rainbow (1999). \"Thank God I Found You\" is an R&B power ballad that was inspired by a relationship Carey was going through at the time, and lyrically recounts a powerful love relationship in which the protagonist tells her lover \"thank God I found you.\" \"Thank God I Found You\" received mixed reviews from contemporary music critics; some felt it was a great album closer while others deemed it as \"un-listenable\" and \"forgettable\". Nevertheless, the song became Carey's fifteenth number-one single on the United States Billboard Hot 100 and remained her last chart topping single until 2005's comeback single \"We Belong Together\". The single was later certified Gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). Aside from its peak of number two in Canada, the song achieved moderate international charting, reaching the top ten in the United Kingdom and peaking within the top thirty in Australia, Belgium (Wallonia), France, Germany, the Netherlands, and Switzerland. A music video for \"Thank God I Found You\", directed by Brett Ratner, features Carey, Joe, and 98 Degrees performing the song at an outdoor concert. The Make It Last Remix had its own video commissioned, which was shot in a grainy fashion in Hamburg, Germany, and shows Carey and the song's featured artists performing at a small club. Carey performed the song's original version and accompanying remix live at the 27th Annual American Music Awards. It was featured on the set-lists of the Rainbow World Tour (2000) and The Adventures of Mimi Tour (2006), with Trey Lorenz serving as the male vocalist. Carey re-recorded her vocals for the song's main remix titled \"Thank God I Found You\" (Make It Last Remix), which features vocals from Joe and Carey's label-mate, rapper Nas. The remix is a remake of Keith Sweat's song \"Make It Last Forever\" (1988), and incorporates a few verses from the original version of \"Thank God I Found You\". DJ Clue produced the remix, transforming it into a slow groove R&B number. In September 2000, US songwriters Seth Swirsky and Warryn Campbell filed a copyright infringement lawsuit against Carey claiming that \"Thank God I Found You\" borrowed heavily from the song \"One of Those Love Songs\" they composed for R&B group Xscape. The court awarded the case in Carey's favor, not finding sufficient similarities between the two songs."@en ;

It was written by band members will.i.am, Fergie, George Pajon, Jr. and Printz Board; will.i.am also produced and engineered the song. The song features compositional samples of songs derived from two Hindi films of the 1970s, Apradh (1972) and Don (1978), as well as interpolations of Lisa Lisa and Cult Jam's 1985 single \"I Wonder If I Take You Home\" and Gucci Crew II's 1988 single \"Sally (That Girl)\". The song was released as the first single from Monkey Business; it was first serviced to mainstream radios on April 12, 2005 in the United States. \"Don't Phunk with My Heart\" is a hip-hop and dance song in which the lyrics, according to will.i.am, tells of a situation between a couple when one tries to end the relationship and the other is in disbelief. The song was received positively by most contemporary music critics, with many of them naming it one of the album's highlights. \"Don't Phunk with My Heart\" was also met with a positive commercial response; it peaked at number three on the US Billboard Hot 100 and at number one in the Australasia countries. It also attained top ten positions in many European countries including the United Kingdom, Ireland, the Netherlands, and Finland.

	dbo:abstract	"\"Pearl's Girl\" is the title of several 1996 single releases and a song by Underworld, from their album Second Toughest in the Infants; where the song is titled \"Pearls Girl\". The single peaked on the UK Singles Chart at #22. The song title comes from the name of a racing greyhound. \"I spent a few nights in Hamburg,\" recalled Karl Hyde, \"and it actually came from a night on the Rioja down by the docks. I'm actually shouting, Rioja, Rioja\u2026 I'd come from this really great club on the Reeperbahn, listening to lots of classic soul, which is where the 'Reverend Al Green' bit comes from. I was sitting by the docks and they have these 'bride boats' there, which people get married on. They go down the river and out to sea. I was just sitting there, Rioja-ed out, watching these boats sail past me at three in the morning. There were bonfires and everything.\""@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"Red Red Wine\" is a song written, performed and originally recorded by American artist Neil Diamond in 1967, included on Neil's second Bang Records album, Just For You. The lyrics are sung from the perspective of someone who finds drinking red wine the only way to forget his woes. When Neil left the Bang Records label in 1968, Bang continued to release Neil Diamond singles, often adding newly recorded instruments and background vocals to album tracks from the two Neil Diamond albums that Bang had issued. For the \"Red Red Wine\" single, Bang added a background choir without Neil's involvement or permission. Diamond's version reached number sixty-two on the Billboard Hot 100 chart in 1968. Diamond later performed a UB40-inspired version of the song on tour. The original album version was released on Diamond's The Greatest Hits (1966-1992) but the 1968 single version has never been issued on a vinyl album or CD. The song was covered by Tony Tribe, Jimmy James & the Vagabonds, shortly after Diamond's recording was released, and recorded much later by British reggae group UB40, whose version topped the U.S. and UK singles charts. Tony Tribe covered the song in 1969 in a reggae-influenced style. UB40 recorded it in 1983 in a lighter reggae style."@en ;

It was released in May 1999 as the second single off their album Maybe You've Been Brainwashed Too and the follow-up to the smash \"You Get What You Give\". The single did not fare as well as the previous single, in part due to the announcement of lead member of the band Gregg Alexander stating that the New Radicals \"[would] no longer be a recording, promoting, or performing entity\" and that he would focus on producing and writing material for other artists. This announcement came just as the music video was being produced for the song and the statement that \"the fatigue of traveling and getting three hours' sleep in a different hotel every night to do boring 'hanging and schmoozing' with radio and retail people is definitely not for me\" effectively stopped all promotion of the song."@en ;

It was released on September 23, 1997 by Mercury Records Nashville as the lead single from Twain's third studio album Come On Over (1997). It was chosen as such following weeks of careful deliberation and constant reconsidering. Originally titled \"'Gol Darn Gone and Done It\", the song's title was altered because of its difficulty to pronounce. The song regards falling in love despite numerous attempts to evade it. It is an uptempo number that prominently features fiddle. Critics favored \"Love Gets Me Every Time\"'s immaculate production. The song became a success in country radio. It topped Billboard's Hot Country Songs chart for five consecutive weeks, Twain's fifth and longest reign on the chart. It was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for shipments of over 500,000 copies in the United States. \"Love Gets Me Every Time\" was also her seventh number-one country hit in Canada. Its music video was directed by photographer Timothy White during the photo shoot for Come On Over's album art. It features Twain in various performance scenes, along with behind-the-scenes shots.

It was released as the lead single from Home at Last, Cyrus' tenth studio album. The song is a soft country ballad with some use of pop and soft rock elements. The song has received different interpretations though, in actuality, Cyrus wrote the song several years before its release when his middle daughter, Miley, moved to Los Angeles in order to pursue an acting career with an audition for the Disney Channel Original Series Hannah Montana. \"Ready, Set, Don't Go\" received critical praise, with reviewers complimenting its lyrical content. It also reached positive commercial responses for Cyrus, compared to his downfall in previous years. Peaking at number 85 on the Billboard Hot 100, it became Cyrus' first entry on the chart since \"You Won't Be Lonely Now\" (2000). The song's accompanying music video was directed by Elliot Lester and features some of Cyrus' home videos; it received a CMT Music Award nomination at the 2008 CMT Music Awards. The song eventually became re-released as a duet with his daughter, pop star Miley Cyrus. At the time of the single's release, she was 14 and enjoying the success of her debut album Meet Miley Cyrus. The duet version became Miley's debut in country music and received better commercial outcomes. It reached its highest international peak in the Billboard Hot 100 at number 37 and became Cyrus' first international chart entry since \"Could've Been Me\" (1992). Cyrus, with and without his daughter, performed the song at several venues, most notably Miley's first headlining concert tour, the Best of Both Worlds Tour."@en ;

Initially written as an acoustic blues song, the song's final version includes a rap by Cat Glover and is full of samples. 'Alphabet St.' generally repeats themes from Lovesexy. The B-side is a remix of \"Alphabet St.\" called \"Alphabet St. (\"This is not music, this is a trip\")\". The title and other phrases are repeated at the beginning of the song, but essentially, it's an instrumental with a few minor changes. \"Alphabet St.\" was the first Prince single released as a CD, albeit only in the UK and Japan.

dbr:Love_Shack	rdf:type	dbo:MusicalWork ;
	dbo:abstract	"\"Love Shack\" is a single by pop-rock band The B-52's. Originally released in 1989 from their album Cosmic Thing, the single was the band's biggest hit song and first million-copy seller. It was also the band's first song to reach the Billboard Top 40 charts, peaking at number 3, also reaching number 2 on the UK Singles Chart, and was number 1 for eight weeks in Australia, number 1 for 4 weeks in New Zealand, number 1 in the Republic of Ireland and also number 1 on the US Modern Rock Tracks chart. Produced by Don Was, the song's inspiration was a cabin around Athens, Georgia, complete with tin roof, where the band conceived \"Rock Lobster\", a single from their first album; it is often said to have been located off \"the Atlanta Highway\", as the first verse implies. B-52's singer Kate Pierson lived in the cabin in the 1970s, and the cabin existed until 2004, when it burned down. \"Tin roof...rusted,\" wailed by lead singer Cindy Wilson, was originally an outtake added to the track, and is perhaps the song's most memorable line. Fred Schneider also provides some memorable lines, including his notable boast of having a Chrysler that is \"as big as a whale\" and \"seats about twenty\". It has come to mean many things to different listeners. The drag queen RuPaul can be seen dancing in the music video that was directed by Adam Bernstein and shot at the home and studio of ceramic artists Philip Maberry and Scott Walker. The song was a comeback of sorts following the band's decline in popularity in the early 1980s coupled with the death of their guitarist, Ricky Wilson, in 1985. The song received a number of accolades following its release. Named as one of the 365 Songs of the Century in 2001, the video for the song received an award from MTV as the Best Group Video, and was named the Best Single of 1989 by Rolling Stone. Additionally, it was ranked #246 in Rolling Stone's list of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time."@en ;

The B-side \"The Big Hand\" was planned as an A-Side single early in 1993 but the idea was scrapped, largely due to Boris Williams not wanting the track to appear on the album but having no qualms about it appearing as a B-side (from KROQ radio interview with the band in 1992). \"The Big Hand\" is one of the few B-sides to be played live, although very rarely. It was first played in 1991, performed a few times during the Wish Tour in 1992, then revived at the Ultra Music Festival in 2007, and popped up, though rarely, during the band's 4Tour World Tour 2007-08. Letters to Felice by Kafka was a huge influence when Robert Smith wrote the lyrics of the track. \"A Letter to Elise\" itself was revived by the band's new Smith/Gallup/Thompson/Cooper lineup in 2005 after being played sparingly, if ever, during the Smith/Gallup/Bamonte/Cooper/O'Donnell era.

The song charted at number 19 in the United Kingdom, making it, at the time, their worst-performing single. The single was officially credited to the Vengaboys ft. Cheekah, referring to the animated computer in the music video, which performs the lyrics (all of which are related to computer terminology, but initially feature some tongue-in-cheek sexual innuendo: e.g. \"The way you used your joystick / Has really made my mouse click\". However in the second part of the song, the lyrics portray sexually transmitted diseases once again using computer terminology e.g. \"The way you used your joystick / Has really made me feel sick\" and \"The doctor checked my hard drive / A virus in my archive / My disc was not protected / and now I am infected\")."@en ;

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/I\u0027m_a_Boy>	rdf:type	dbo:MusicalWork ;
	dbo:abstract	"\"I'm a Boy\" is a 1966 rock song written by Pete Townshend for The Who. The song, like other early recordings by the band, such as \"I Can't Explain\", \"The Kids Are Alright\" and \"Happy Jack\", centers on the early power pop genre. The song was originally intended to be a part of a rock opera called 'Quads' which was to be set in the future where parents can choose the sex of their children. The idea was later scrapped, but this song survived and was later released as a single. The song is about a family who \"order\" four girls, but a mistake is made and three girls and one boy are delivered instead. The boy dreams of partaking in sports and other boy-type activities, but his mother forces him to act like his sisters and refuses to believe the truth (Thereby the refrain \"I'm a boy, I'm a boy, but my Mum won't admit it...\".) The track was produced by Kit Lambert at IBC Studios around 31 July - 1 August 1966 and released just over three weeks later on 26 August 1966 with \"In the City\" as the B-side. The single was successful, reaching number 2 in the UK singles chart. It failed to repeat that success in the USA. The original recording (released as a single) which features John Entwistle's French horn arrangement prominently in the mix is available on the album Who's Missing. The version included on most compilations, since the 1966 release, is the exact the same recording, with French horns removed. A different, slower version was recorded in London in the week of 3 October 1966 and was intended for an early version of A Quick One titled Jigsaw Puzzle but was later released on Meaty Beaty Big and Bouncy in 1971. Another similar version was released on a bonus disc of The Ultimate Collection in 2002 and is unique to that album. The song was performed at The Who's legendary concert at Leeds, released in album format as Live at Leeds.On the Live at Leeds album, Pete Townshend comments on the song by saying: The single's B-side, \"In the City\", inspired The Jam's song of the same name. The latter borrows its chord progression and a part of its lyrics from the Who song."@en ;

The song has sold 510,000 copies in the UK as stated by the Official UK Charts Company and won the Best British Single at the 2003 BRIT Awards.The song was the 86th best-selling single of the 2000s in the UK. The song proved to be Liberty X's breakthrough to mainstream and critical success, in the process overtaking rivals Hear'Say in terms of success.

During Celebrity Big Brother 6, Michelle Heaton, who performed a version of the song wearing a tight PVC catsuit for a Big Brother task, revealed that she did not contribute vocals to \"Just a Little\" because she \"wasn't good enough to cut it\". The song was used in an advert for MoneySuperMarket in July 2015."@en ;

Described as a \"surprisingly poignant\", the melancholic ballad received favorable reviews from contemporary music critics; however, it was criticised for its similarities with Oasis."@en ;

AllMusic has since described it as \"an instant classic with its distinctive melody and catchy chorus.\" The song is included in numerous hits collections of the period, especially in the U.S., but it was not as popular throughout the rest of the world at the time. Peaking at number 24 in Hart's native Canada, it was not a hit in Europe and failed to chart at all in the UK. The Local band covered the song and gained Corey some attention in the year of 2015."@en ;

The music video was filmed with the band playing in an art room, where artists are in the middle of painting a mural artwork, directed by Tom Stern and Alex Winter. The song was recorded prior to Chad Smith's joining the band; drums are played by Fishbone's Philip \"Fish\" Fisher. When the song is played backwards, the voice heard at the start is Anthony Kiedis clearly singing the chorus. This song also features a trumpet solo by Flea. A slightly longer version of the song was featured on the film Say Anything... starring Kiedis' girlfriend at the time, Ione Skye. The single contained two original B-sides. \"Show Me Your Soul\" was recorded during the Mother's Milk sessions and was also later released as a single in 1990. \"Millionaires Against Hunger\" was recorded during the 1985 Freaky Styley. The single reached number twenty-nine in the UK\u2014the highest position for the band up to that point.

It was released on October 2, 1995 in Francophone countries and in December 1995 in selected European countries. In Canada it was a radio-only release (July 1995). The narrator of the song boasts that she is unafraid to face any number of tribulations and challenges of the body and spirit, but admits life without the one she loves just might be more than she could bear. Dion has stated that this is one of her favorites among her songs, because it reminds her of her feelings for husband Ren\u00E9 Ang\u00E9lil. \"Je sais pas\" was written and produced by Jean-Jacques Goldman and J. Kapler. Two music videos were made for this song: a non-singing version and a performance (singing) one, both of which were directed by Gregg Masuak in 1995. These music videos can be found on Dion's DVD On ne change pas (2005). Edited versions of the non-singing video were also used for \"Next Plane Out\" and \"Call the Man\" singles (none of them was released in France). An English version of this song, called \"I Don't Know\" was featured on Falling into You. Live version of \"Je sais pas\" from Live \u00E0 Paris was also released as a single, on May 19, 1997 in the Netherlands to promote that album. The song was featured on Dion's greatest hits compilation On ne change pas. The live version was a part of two other albums: Live \u00E0 Paris and Au c\u0153ur du stade; the former was also released as a single on May 19, 1997 in the Netherlands to promote the live album. Dion also performed it during the French concerts of her 2008-09 Taking Chances World Tour. The audio and footage of this performance was included in the French edition of Taking Chances World Tour: The Concert CD/DVD. In 2013, the song was performed for the Sans attendre Tour; the Quebec performance was included in the C\u00E9line une seule fois / Live 2013 CD/DVD. \"Je sais pas\" was a smash hit in France, where it topped the singles chart for seven weeks, selling 510,000 copies (should be certified platinum but it remains undercertified with silver award). It was also number 1 in Belgium Wallonia (for two weeks) and Quebec (four weeks). The 1995 studio version peaked at number 34 in the Netherlands.

Written by the band's guitarist Justin Hayward, it was first released as a single with \"My Song\" on the B-side, and then on the 1971 album Every Good Boy Deserves Favour shortly after. On the album, \"The Story in Your Eyes\" is the second track, and is preceded by the track \"Procession\", the first and only song that was written by all five band members. The song was intended to describe the history of music from the beginning of time, and the only three words in the whole piece are \"desolation\", \"creation\", and \"communication\". \"The Story in Your Eyes\" features a repeated electric guitar riff, a propulsive yet elegant bass line, and Justin Hayward on lead vocals, while incremental use of a Mellotron and a choral background generates an expansive, rhapsodic sound. \"The Story in Your Eyes\" was the Moody Blues' final single to feature only the Mellotron as it would be supplanted by the chamberlin, a similar instrument in time for their next album, Seventh Sojourn. The SACD release of the album Every Good Boy Deserves Favour contains a version of \"The Story in Your Eyes\" that has the Mellotron in dominant role.

In the 1993 Metal Edge Readers' Choice Awards, the song was voted \"Song of the Year\" and \"Best Song From a Movie Soundtrack.\" Def Leppard have recorded two different versions of the song - an electric version and an acoustic version - the widely released one was the acoustic version which featured on the greatest hits Vault. The widely released acoustic version differs from the original B-Side, as it featured the addition of strings by Michael Kamen, for usage on the Last Action Hero soundtrack. Eduardo Rivadavia, reviewing Retro Active for Allmusic.com, called Two Steps Behind along with Miss You In A Heartbeat \"solid, but hardly groundbreaking ballads\" and one of the album picks. Def Leppard's acoustic version also features on the CMT Crossroads DVD with Taylor Swift as a bonus feature. Along with the song \"Let's Get Rocked\" from their 1992 album Adrenalize, this is one of only two songs by the band released after the 1980s that is still regularly performed live on nearly all of the bands' tours."@en ;

The song was released as a single that same year and became an international hit for the band, peaking at number 15 on the Billboard Pop Singles chart. It was a chart hit in the band's native UK, reaching number 29 on the UK Singles Chart. The single was re-released in 1992 to raise funds for the ITV Telethon Charity event, but failed to chart. Its writing credits are given to Rick Davies and Roger Hodgson, although it is a Hodgson composition. Hodgson and Davies shared writing credits from 1974 until 1983, when Hodgson left Supertramp. The song is characterized by the ringing tones of 12-string acoustic guitars, which is joined by a Hohner Clavinet through a Leslie speaker in the bridge of the song. Drummer Bob Siebenberg recounted that \"Roger had been working at Malibu for quite a while on this tune. I'd hear the song in hotel rooms and places like that. He had the song on a little tape when I first joined the band so I was quite familiar with the tune. We tried out various drum things and it seemed right to ride it along on the snare drum... giving it something almost like a train beat. So it's all on the snare and bass drum, with no tom-tom fills or anything.\" A short snippet of the song is played in the film Superman shortly before Lois Lane's death scene. The song, however, is not featured on the movie's soundtrack. The song was used interwoven with the final scenes and part of the end credits for the Ricky Gervais film The Invention of Lying. The song was used in 2014 for Stouffer's, Coca Cola's Share Happiness commercials and for Target Australia's Christmas commercials in 2014."@en ;

dbr:Girls_in_Their_Summer_Clothes	rdf:type	dbo:MusicalWork ;
	dbo:abstract	"\"Girls in Their Summer Clothes\" is a song by American recording artist Bruce Springsteen, from his album Magic. Matched with a pop-oriented melody, Springsteen's full-throated singing, and a pop-orchestral arrangement, the lyric portrays a series of warm small-town vignettes: \"Girls in Their Summer Clothes\" has been cited as a singularly \"breezy\" song on the album, though A. O. Scott of The New York Times notes: \"Not that 'Girls in Their Summer Clothes' is untouched by melancholy. Its narrator, after all, stands and watches as the girls of the title 'pass me by.'\" Jay Lustig of The Star-Ledger writes that the song \"unfolds gradually and at its own eccentric pace, with the music, and Springsteen's vocals, getting progressively more intense.\" It was released for iTunes digital download on January 15, 2008, as a single-like \"bundle\" consisting of two audio tracks and an accompanying video. As such the \"Winter Mix\" of the song was presented, which featured a single not doubled Springsteen vocal track, some added or enhanced percussion parts, and similar small changes. The release achieved minor chart success, reaching positions 95 on the Billboard Hot 100, 67 on the Pop 100, and 62 on Hot Digital Songs. It also hit 27 on Billboards Mainstream Rock charts. The music video for the song (entitled \"Girls in Their Summer Clothes (Winter Mix)\") was directed by Mark Pellington. Filmed on the Jersey Shore on a cold winter day, it showed girls and women of various ages, interspersed with shots of Springsteen strumming his vintage Gibson J-45 acoustic guitar. The backing E Street Band was not shown. Parts of the video mirrored the song's imagery, especially the diner scene. \"Girls in Their Summer Clothes\" was regularly featured on the 2007\u20132008 Magic Tour, often as the first encore song, although it suffered being dropped during a number of shows in early portions of 2008. One such first leg of tour performance was recorded an included in the January 2008 digital download bundle. In typically delayed fashion, the song garnered two nominations for the Grammy Awards of 2009, Best Rock Song and Best Solo Rock Vocal Performance. It won the first, but lost the second to John Mayer's \"Gravity\". Springsteen subsequently confessed that he had not been tracking this closely: \"I didn't even know I was up for a Grammy! I opened the newspaper on Monday and saw that I had won, and thought, 'Well, that's great!'\" Although the song's lush pop-orchestral production approach was extended on many of the tracks of Springsteen's 2009 album Working on a Dream, \"Girls in Their Summer Clothes\" was little played on Springsteen and the E Street Band's associated Working on a Dream Tour."@en ;

Written by Madonna and Steve Bray, it was one of the first songs developed for the project and, according to Madonna, was inspired by a girl who is saved by an angel, and she falls in love with him. \"Angel\" was released as a 12\" single with \"Into the Groove\" in some countries and charted likewise. A music video was initially planned for the release, but was later cancelled. Instead a promotional video comprising clips from her previous videos was released in the United Kingdom. Musically \"Angel\" consists of three chord ascending hook, which serves for the verse and chorus. It has vocal harmonies beneath the main chorus and the lyrics repeat the angel-like image of Madonna's saviour. Critical response to the song was mixed, with some music critics calling it a classic and others deeming it sub-par compared to Madonna's previous singles. \"Angel\" became the singer's fifth consecutive top-five single on the Billboard Hot 100 and reached the top of its dance charts. It was also able to reach number-one in Australia and the top-five of the charts in Canada, Ireland, Japan, New Zealand, Spain and the United Kingdom.

	dbo:abstract	"\"Vogue\" (stylized as \"vogue\") is a song by Japanese recording artist Ayumi Hamasaki, taken from her third studio album Duty (2000). It was written by Hamasaki and produced by Max Matsuura. The song is a pop with elements of Latin pop and Japanese pop. The lyrical content for \"Vogue\" is about Hamasaki's nostalgia and her looking back on her past. As a trilogy single alongside \"Far Away\" and \"Seasons\", \"Vogue\"'s main theme of the songs focus on hopelessness, a reflection of Hamasaki's disappointment that she had not expressed herself thoroughly in any of her previous lyrics. It was released as the lead single from the album on 26 April 2000 by Avex Trax and Avex Taiwan. Critical reception towards \"Vogue\" has been positive; majority of the critics commended the song writing and influences of Latin music, and highlighted it as an album and career stand out track. In Japan, \"Vogue\" failed to reach the top spot and peaked at number three on the Oricon Singles Chart. \"Vogue\" reached number four on the Japanese Count Down TV chart, Hamasaki's lowest charting single since her 1999 single \"To Be\". \"Vogue\" was certified double platinum by the Recording Industry Association of Japan (RIAJ) for shipments of 500,000 units. Released as a DVD Single in December 2000 with \"Far Away\" and \"Seasons\", it reached number one on the Oricon DVD Chart. The accompanying music video was directed by Wataru Takeishi, featuring Hamasaki singing in a photo album in a post-apocalyptic world. Two children find the book, and start to read over the book and watch Hamasaki sing. \"Vogue\" has been included on several concert tours and New Year Countdown shows held and hosted by Hamasaki, and has featured on majority of her greatest hits compilations."@en ;

The track also topped the Billboard Hot Country Songs and Hot Adult Contemporary Tracks charts that same year and was certified Gold on August 14, 1969, by the RIAA.

	dbo:abstract	"\"Alive\" is a downtempo ballad recorded by American entertainer Jennifer Lopez. It was written by Lopez, Cris Judd, and Cory Rooney for the Michael Apted-directed thriller, Enough (2002). Lopez stars in the film as Slim, a waitress who marries a wealthy contractor, and flees with their young daughter as he becomes increasingly abusive. While on the run, Slim, who discovers that her husband is following her, \"trains herself for a final, violent confrontation\". The producers of Enough wanted her to write a new song for film, however, Lopez felt as if it was not something that could be forced. In October 2001, while on their honeymoon, Judd played Lopez a melody that he had written on the piano. She thought that the melody was \"really beautiful\", and that it would be perfect fit for Enough. She incorporated the hardships that Slim went through in the film, as well as her own personal struggles, into the song's lyrics. \"Alive\" doesn't appear on the film score of Enough, and instead was included on Lopez's first remix album, J to tha L\u2013O! The Remixes (2002). It was serviced to radio in the United States on May 21, 2002, by Epic Records. The song was released commercially on a 12\" vinyl as a double a-side along with \"I'm Gonna Be Alright\" on July 30. Music critics were divided on \"Alive\"; some deemed Lopez's change in musical style to be refreshing, while others felt as if she should stick to the dance arrangements of her previous work. The song's accompanying music video was directed by Jim Gable. It features Lopez playing the piano, writing the lyrics to \"Alive\" and recording the song, intercut between scenes from Enough. While the song failed to appear on any national charts, it did reach number two on the US Billboard Dance Music/Club Play Singles chart. Lopez performed the song live on The Oprah Winfrey Show on May 17, 2002."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"Crazy Horses\" is a 1972 hit by The Osmonds reaching number 14 on the US Billboard Hot 100 and number 2 in the UK Singles Chart. It is a heavy rock style which was a major stylistic departure from the type of music for which The Osmonds were known; it is also unusual in that Jay Osmond sings lead vocals on most of the track (with Merrill Osmond, the band's usual lead singer, singing the short choruses). The record was co-produced by Alan Osmond and Michael Lloyd, who had previously been in psychedelic rock group The West Coast Pop Art Experimental Band. The song is claimed to be a protest about the amount of pollution created by cars. It is one of their best known hits and has been covered by numerous other bands including The Sensational Alex Harvey Band, The Mission, Tank, Lawnmower Deth, Neal Morse, The Frames, KMFDM, Electric Six, and Lifescreen. Westlife covered the song live in 2003, and even performed the song alongside Donny Osmond. English band Pop Will Eat Itself sampled the record on their 1988 single Def Con One. The song was also covered by Tigertailz on the 2010 live album Bezerk: Live...Burnin' Fuel. The song was also covered by Mat Sinner on the solo album Back to the Bullet 1990. Donny Osmond recorded a new version of the song as a hidden bonus track on his 2002 covers album Somewhere In Time and performs the song frequently on his tours. He did not sing on the original record."@en ;

Jackson had a long-standing history of releasing socially conscious material such as \"We Are the World\", \"Man in the Mirror\" and \"Heal the World\". However, \"Earth Song\" was the first that overtly dealt with the environment and animal welfare. \"Earth Song\" was made for the Dangerous album but it failed to make the final cut. The song was written and composed by Jackson; the task of production was split between Jackson, David Foster and Bill Bottrell. \"Earth Song\" was accompanied by a lavish music video shot in four geographical regions. It centered on the destruction and rebirth of Earth and went on to receive a Grammy nomination in 1997. The song was a top five hit in most European countries. It remains Jackson's best-selling single in the United Kingdom, and was the country's number-one Christmas single in 1995. \"Earth Song\" was not released as a single in the United States. Jackson went on to receive recognition from various animal and environmental organizations. In 2011 the song was paired-up with the poem \"Planet Earth\" (previously released on Michael Jackson's This Is It, in 2009) and released as a song in the remix album Immortal. The song was the last song to be rehearsed by Jackson, shortly after midnight on June 25, 2009, making it the final song ever performed by Michael Jackson."@en ;

It was released on 10 November 2003 but there were numerous problems. On most CD1s of the set, the track listing was accidentally swapped so that \"Yeh Yeh Yeh\" was the first track on the CD. Because of this misprint, and following strong competition on the week in single release in UK, lack of promotion, and distribution problems, the single entered the UK Singles Chart at number twenty-seven, sealing Chisholm's fate with Virgin Records and further hindering any hope for the album's success.

	dbo:abstract	"\"My Immortal\" is a song by American rock band Evanescence from their debut studio album Fallen (2003). It was released by Wind-up Records on December 8, 2003, as the third single from the album. The song was entirely written by guitarist Ben Moody, with the exception of the bridge, which was later written by lead singer Amy Lee, and it was produced by Dave Fortman. \"My Immortal\" was included on their EP release Mystary (2003) and on the demo album Origin (2000). The version originally from Origin was later included on Fallen. The single version of the song was called \"band version\" because of the additional band performing the bridge and final chorus of the song. \"My Immortal\" is a piano rock song written in slow and free tempo. Moody was rumored to have been inspired to write it after the death of his grandfather. Lyrically, it talks about \"a spirit staying with you after its death and haunting you until you actually wish that the spirit were gone because it won't leave you alone.\" Critical reception towards the song was positive, with critics complimenting its piano melody. In 2005 it received a nomination for Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals at the 47th Grammy Awards. The song was also commercially successful, peaking within the top ten in more than ten countries. It also peaked at number seven on the Billboard Hot 100 and topped the charts in Canada, Greece and the US Adult Pop Songs chart. The single was certified gold in the United States, and platinum in Australia. An accompanying music video directed by David Mould was filmed entirely in black-and-white in Gothic Quarter, Barcelona on October 10, 2003. The video shows Lee sitting and singing on various locations, but never touching the ground. Shots of Moody are also shown but he is never together with his band or Lee. The video was nominated in the category for Best Rock Video at the 2004 MTV Video Music Awards. The song was performed by the band during their Fallen Tour and The Open Door Tour. It was also performed live during some of their television appearances and award ceremonies such as the Billboard Music Awards."@en ;

It was released on November 27, 2007 by Jive Records as the second single from the album. The song was written and produced by Swedish producers Bloodshy & Avant and Klas \u00C5hlund as a response to the media scrutiny and sensationalism of Spears' private life, which they had seen by working with her over the years. \"Piece of Me\" was the last song to be recorded for Blackout. The self-manifesto song's lyrics are written like a biography retelling her mishaps. Musically, \"Piece of Me\" is an electro song that runs through a down-tempo dance beat. Spears' voice is heavily synthesized, and constantly shifts in pitch. Backing vocals are provided by Bloodshy and Avant and Robyn. \"Piece of Me\" has received general positive reviews, praising its production and defiant lyrics, while citing it as one of the highlights from Blackout. Rolling Stone ranked the song at number fifteen on their list of the 100 Best Songs of 2007. It was also commercially successful, peaking at number one in Ireland and reaching top ten positions in Australia, Austria, Canada, Denmark, Finland, New Zealand, Sweden and the United Kingdom. In the United States, it became the second single from the album to have peaked at the top of the Billboard Hot Dance Club Play chart. The music video, directed by Wayne Isham, portrayed Spears' life at the time and showed her with her friends disguising themselves in order to confuse the paparazzi. Isham's concept was to have Spears confidently parodying her situation. It received mixed reviews from critics, most arguing her body was digitally altered. The video was nominated in three categories at the 2008 MTV Video Music Awards and won all of them, including Video of the Year. \"Piece of Me\" was performed at The Circus Starring Britney Spears (2009) and the Femme Fatale Tour (2011).

The song was the fourth, final, and title single lifted from the band's album of the same name, and was edited for its release. It was issued worldwide in January 1983 and became an immediate Top 10 hit in the UK Singles Chart, peaking at #9 on 11 December 1982. The song did not attract much notice in the United States upon its initial global release, but received very early airplay at highly influential KROQ in Los Angeles as early as 2 August 1982. After the band's breakthrough hit \"Hungry Like the Wolf\" stormed MTV and scaled the American charts in December 1982, radio programmers paid closer attention to the catchy melody and insistent, intricate bass line of \"Rio\", and Capitol Records reissued the single in March 1983 to great success. It is one of the band's most recognizable songs, mostly due to its famous music video, which is widely regarded as symbolic of 1980s glamour and excess."@en ;

The Merseys version is more up-tempo than The McCoys folk-rock original. Propelled by Clem Cattini's drumming it features a powerful horn arrangement (most probably the work of John Paul Jones).

The song has been featured on the soundtrack of the 1986 film Stand by Me. In 2012 it was estimated that the songs royalties had topped \u00A317 million, making it the sixth highest earning song as of that time. 50% of the royalties were paid to King. In 2015, King's original version was inducted into the National Recording Registry by the Library of Congress for being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\", just under five weeks before King's death. Later in the year the 2015 line up of The Drifters covered the song in tribute to King."@en ;

It was written by Hamasaki and produced by Max Matsuura. The song is a rock with elements of alternative rock. \"Surreal\" describes Hamasaki's madness and sense of confusion, while the themes of \"Surreal\" are based on Hamasaki's concept of loneliness, chaos, confusion, and the burden of her responsibilities, aimed mostly towards her public image as an recording artist. It was released as the fourth single from the album on 27 September 2000 by Avex Trax and Avex Taiwan. Critical reception towards \"Surreal\" has been positive; majority of the critics commended the song writing and musical delivery, and highlighted it as an album and career stand out track. In Japan, \"Surreal\" became her sixth number one on the Oricon Singles Chart, and also reached the top spot on the Japanese Count Down TV chart. \"Surreal\" was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of Japan (RIAJ) for shipments of 250,000 units. Released as a DVD Single in December 2000, it reached number three on the Oricon DVD Chart. The accompanying music video was directed by Wataru Takeishi, featuring Hamasaki walking along a beach front. With mysterious lighting hovering over several objects, she enters a jungle-like room to find a clone of herself; the clone wears the same outfit for the Duty and \"Surreal\" photo shoot. \"Surreal\" has been included on several concert tours and New Year Countdown shows held and hosted by Hamasaki, and has featured on majority of her greatest hits compilations."@en ;

The song became their breakthrough hit, establishing the duo worldwide. Its striking music video helped to propel the song to number 2 on the UK Singles Chart and number 1 on the US Billboard Hot 100.

	dbo:abstract	"\"Today\" is a song by American alternative rock band The Smashing Pumpkins, written by lead vocalist and guitarist Billy Corgan. The song, though seemingly upbeat, contains dark lyrics. Corgan wrote the song about a day in which he was having suicidal thoughts, exemplified by the reference to self-mutilation in the chorus. The contrast between the grim subject matter of the song and the soft instrumental part during the verses, coupled with use of irony in the lyrics, left many listeners unaware of the song's tale of depression and desperation. The song alternates between quiet, dreamy verses and loud choruses with layered, distorted guitar similar to the noisy guitar rock of My Bloody Valentine. \"Today\" was released in September 1993 as the second single from the band's second album and major label debut, Siamese Dream. Although Corgan opted for \"Cherub Rock\", the lead single from the album, to be the opening track, \"Today\" and its follow-up \"Disarm\" are credited in AllMusic for popularizing the band and \"sen[ding] [Siamese Dream] into the stratosphere\". \"Today\" has been generally well received by critics; a Blender article described it as having \"achieved a remarkable status as one of the defining songs of its generation, perfectly mirroring the fractured alienation of American youth in the 1990s.\""@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"Heartbreak Hotel\" is a song recorded by American singer Elvis Presley. It was released as a single on January 27, 1956, Presley's first on his new record label RCA Victor. It was written by Tommy Durden and Mae Boren Axton. A newspaper article about the suicide of a lonely man who jumped from a hotel window inspired the lyrics. Axton presented the song to Presley in November 1955 at a country music convention in Nashville. Presley agreed to record it, and did so on January 10, 1956, in a session with his band, the Blue Moon Boys, the guitarist Chet Atkins, and the pianist Floyd Cramer. \"Heartbreak Hotel\" comprises an eight-bar blues progression, with heavy reverberation throughout the track, to imitate the character of Presley's Sun recordings. The single topped Billboard's Top 100 chart for seven weeks, Cashbox's pop singles chart for six weeks, was number one on the Country and Western chart for seventeen weeks and reached number three on the R&B chart, becoming Presley's first million-seller, and one of the best-selling singles of 1956. \"Heartbreak Hotel\" achieved unheard of feats as it reached the top 5 of Country and Western, pop, and Rhythm 'n' Blues charts simultaneously. It would eventually be certified double platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America. Presley had first performed \"Heartbreak Hotel\" during a live show in December 1955 during a tour of the Louisiana Hayride, but the song gained strong popularity after his appearance on Stage Show in March 1956. It became a staple of Presley's repertoire in live appearances, last performed by him on May 29, 1977 at the Civic Center in Baltimore, Maryland. In 1995 \"Heartbreak Hotel\" was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame, and in 2004 Rolling Stone magazine named it one of the \"500 Greatest Songs of All Time\". That year it was also included in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's \"500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll\". A rock and roll standard, since its original release \"Heartbreak Hotel\" has been covered by several rock and pop acts, including Willie Nelson and Leon Russell, who recorded a duet version that topped the Country charts in 1979."@en ;

It was released as the third single from the album in Europe, on March 20, 1998 by Columbia Records. Similar to the treatments of \"Butterfly\" and \"Breakdown\", \"The Roof\" received a limited worldwide release due to Carey's conflict at the time with Sony. The song was written and produced by Carey and Trackmasters, and is built around a sample from \"Shook Ones part II\" by Mobb Deep. The song's lyrics recount an intimate roof-top encounter between lovers, and how the memory affects the protagonist. The extended remix features a rap verse by Mobb Deep; both versions were well received by contemporary music critics. In the music video, Carey is seen in a limousine recounting an encounter she shared on a rainy night. Additionally, past scenes of the event are shown, with Carey caressing her lover at a roof-top party. During the videos climax, Carey open the limousines sun-roof and stands in the rain, trying to recapture the moments she shared in the rain. Aside from the Japanese concerts, Carey performed the song live during her Butterfly World Tour in 1998. Due to the song's limited release, \"The Roof\" did not chart in most major music markets, with the exception of The Netherlands and the United Kingdom, where it peaked at numbers 63 and 96, respectively.

He signed with RCA Victor in 1960 and \"Wonderful World,\" then unreleased, was issued as a single in competition. The song was mainly composed by songwriting team Lou Adler and Herb Alpert, but Cooke revised the lyrics to mention the subject of education more. \"Wonderful World\" ended up doing substantially better on the charts than several of his early RCA singles, becoming his biggest hit single since \"You Send Me\" (1957). The song peaked at number 12 on the Billboard Hot 100 and hit number two on Billboard's Hot R&B Sides chart. Herman's Hermits charted better with a cover of the song in 1965, reaching number four in the United States and number seven in the United Kingdom, respectively.

The song was featured in the 1978 film Animal House and gained greater recognition in the UK upon a 1986 re-release when it peaked at number two on the UK Singles Chart, going silver. Its success was attributed to sound-alike versions featured in the film Witness (1985) and a memorable Levi's 501 television commercial."@en ;

In the United Kingdom, it was marketed as a double A-side single, along with \"Shame for You\". While the melody incorporates a sample of Sandie Shaw's \"Puppet on a String\", the lyrics directly describe Allen's real life younger brother, actor Alfie Allen, criticising him for his lazy behaviour. Contemporary critics gave the song mixed reviews, some complimenting the production, while others considered it fell flat as the album's last song. The single peaked inside the top 20 of the charts in New Zealand and on the UK Singles Chart, where it became her third single to do so. The accompanying music video portrayed Allen's brother as a puppet while the storyline follows the lyrical meaning of the song.

	dbo:abstract	"\"All Together Now\" is a song by Liverpudlian baggy band The Farm from their album Spartacus, and links some of the band's favourite themes: socialism, brotherhood and football. Peter Hooton wrote the lyrics in his early 20's after reading about the extraordinary events on the Western Front during Christmas 1914 - it is fundamentally a song about peace and reconciliation. No Mans Land ( 6 verses) was recorded for a John Peel session in the 1980s but in 1990 Peter wrote the chorus after Steve Grimes suggested putting lyrics of No Man's Land to the music of Pachelbel's Canon. To shorten the song for radio Suggs (original producer in 1990) decided to lose the last 3 verses. It has been used by numerous football teams since. Hooton has quoted \"The unauthorised spontaneous truce 100 years ago was a unique act of humanity amidst the horrors of trench warfare. A triumph of humanity over conflict. There are numerous accounts of British and German troops greeting each other, conversing, swapping presents and even playing football in No Man\u2019s Land on Christmas Day 1914. On some parts of the front the \u2018truce\u2019 lasted several days and in some instances well into January as soldiers on both sides were reluctant to resume the fighting.\" Peter Hooton explained \u2018there is a lot of debate about the causes of the First World War, who was to blame and emphasis on the horrors and futility of the tactics employed but we would like people to concentrate on this incredible moment when ordinary soldiers came together. This event should be cherished and publicised as an incredibly unique moment in the history of conflict throughout the ages.\u2019"@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"Anyway, Anyhow, Anywhere\" was a single released by The Who in 1965. It features call-and-response lyrics (especially common in Who lyrics at this time) and some of the first ever recorded guitar feedback. The song was composed by lead singer Roger Daltrey and guitarist Pete Townshend, the only time they wrote together. The guitar feedback, although not the first to be heard on a record (see The Beatles' \"I Feel Fine\"), is thought to be the first solo with feedback. This is the first Who release with Nicky Hopkins playing piano. Townshend: \"I wrote the first verse and Roger helped me with the rest. I was inspired by listening to Charlie Parker, feeling that this was really a free spirit, and whatever he'd done with drugs and booze and everything else, that his playing released him and freed his spirit, and I wanted us to be like that, and I wanted to write a song about that, a spiritual song.\" The song was rarely played live for most of The Who's career, but since 1999 has become a staple for their live shows; it appears on the album Live at the Royal Albert Hall.

	dbo:abstract	"\"Boulevard of Broken Dreams\" is a song by American punk rock band Green Day, recorded for their seventh studio album American Idiot (2004). Reprise Records released \"Boulevard of Broken Dreams\" as the second single from American Idiot. The song's lyrics were written by lead singer Billie Joe Armstrong, and composed by the band. Production was handled by Rob Cavallo and Green Day. \"Boulevard of Broken Dreams\" remains one of Green Day's signature songs. The song speaks from the point of view of American Idiot's main character, Jesus of Suburbia, and is a moderate midtempo song characterized by somber and bleak lyrics. This is in contrast to the previous track on the album, \"Holiday\", which illustrates Jesus of Suburbia's high of being in The City. MTV's Green Day Makes a Video described \"Holiday\" as a party, and \"Boulevard of Broken Dreams\" as the subsequent hangover. The song was ranked the number one on Rolling Stone's Reader's Choice: Singles of the Decade list in 2009 and number 65 on the 100 Best Songs of the Decade list in the same year. It has sold over 2 million copies in the United States as of 2010. The single peaked at number two in the United States, making it Green Day's most successful song.

The song was released as a digital download on April 11, 2006, as the album's fourth single and was serviced to contemporary hit radio in the United States on May 8, 2006. \"Buttons\" uses strong elements of Middle Eastern music in its production. Lyrically, the song involves Scherzinger speaking of a woman's desire to be undressed. Critics were divided on \"Buttons\" with some complimenting the song's production, however, others criticized it followed the same formula of their previous singles. The song reached the top-five in countries such as Australia, Germany, and the United Kingdom. The song reached number one in Austria and in New Zealand, where it became their fourth consecutive number one single on the chart. It peaked at number three on the US Billboard Hot 100 and sold over two million copies in the United States, making The Pussycat Dolls the first female group in digital history to have three singles pass the two million mark in digital sales. The sepia-toned music video directed by Francis Lawrence features The Pussycat Dolls in various dance sequences. Other scenes include Scherzinger by herself singing the verses. Since its release, \"Buttons\" has become a staple in Scherzinger's live performances.

The song reached number 9 on the UK Singles Chart. \"Condemnation\" is a gospel-esque song with a rock twist. The 7\" version is the \"Paris Mix\", with female backing vocals added and an emerging drum beat scheme. Band members indicated that this song normally would have been sung by Martin Gore, but Dave Gahan insisted on singing it instead. Gahan voted for \"Condemnation\" to be the first single for Songs of Faith and Devotion, but lost. The B-sides are remixes of \"Death's Door\" and \"Rush\", and some live tracks from the Devotional Tour. \"Death's Door\" was a song from the 1991 Until the End of the World soundtrack. The original version is still exclusive to that CD, recorded only by Martin Gore and Alan Wilder after the World Violation Tour was over. The music video for \"Condemnation\" was directed by Anton Corbijn and was shot in Hungary.

Originally titled \"Panic\", the earliest known version of the song existed in 1998, performed live during the band's first gig in the same year. It had a different melody, and was included in the band's second EP, The Blue Room. The track was reproduced by Coldplay and British producer Ken Nelson for the band's debut studio album, Parachutes. Following their successful releases in 2000, Coldplay and their record label Parlophone thought there was enough exposure of the album in the United Kingdom. Thus, the decision of releasing a fourth single would be for regions that had not been overdosed by the hit singles \"Yellow\" and \"Trouble\". They settled on \"Don't Panic\", which at the time was an audience favorite. The single was released in some European regions, and the United Kingdom only received a promo edition. The critical reception of the song was generally positive."@en ;

Written by Gabrielle and Tim Laws and produced by Richie Fermie, it reached number one on the UK Singles Chart for three weeks in June 1993. The single entered the UK chart at number 2, which was the highest chart entry a debut act ever scored in the UK at that time. The song also peaked at number 26 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart in the US and at number-one on the Billboard Hot Dance Club Play chart. In Australia, the song made number two on the ARIA Charts. Originally the song included a sample of the song \"Fast Car\" by Tracy Chapman, but because of copyright reasons the sample had to be removed. This single is seen as her signature song and the title of her greatest hits compilation Dreams Can Come True, Greatest Hits Vol. 1 is drawn from its lyrics. The song was later sampled by the More Fire Crew on their 2002 single \"Dreams\". The song is featured heavily in the 1999 Paul Thomas Anderson film Magnolia, where the character 'Quiz Kid' Donnie Smith plays the song repeatedly as a motivational aid. It is also used in the trailer for the 2000 film Purely Belter."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"Enola Gay\" is an anti-war song by the British synthpop group Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark (OMD). It was the only single from the band's 1980 album, Organisation. Written by Andy McCluskey, it addresses the atomic bombing of Hiroshima on 6 August 1945, during the final stages of World War II, and directly mentions three components of the attack: the Boeing B-29 Superfortress Enola Gay, which dropped the nuclear weapon Little Boy on Hiroshima at \"8:15\". \"Enola Gay\" has come to be regarded as one of the great pop songs. Critic Ned Raggett in AllMusic lauded the track as \"astounding...a flat-out pop classic \u2013 clever, heartfelt, thrilling, and confident, not to mention catchy and arranged brilliantly\"; colleague Dave Thompson called it a \"perfect synth-dance-pop extravaganza.\" It featured in MusicRadar's \"The 40 Greatest Synth Tracks Ever\" in 2009, who noted that the song \"includes some of the biggest synth hooks of all time.\" In 2012, NME listed the track among the \"100 Best Songs of the 1980s\", describing McCluskey's vocal as \"brilliantly quizzical\" and the song as a \"pop classic\". It was selected by the BBC for use during the opening ceremony of the 2012 Summer Olympics in London. When released as a single, \"Enola Gay\", was misperceived by listeners with little knowledge of the Hiroshima bombing as a cryptic identification of the band as homosexual; the track was banned from being played on popular BBC1 programme Swap Shop for fear that it would serve as a corrupting sexual influence on children. Nevertheless, it was an enormous success, going on to sell more than 5 million copies internationally. The song was a hit in many countries, topping the charts in France, Italy and Portugal. It was a sleeper hit in OMD's native UK: the track entered the UK Singles Chart at number 35, but climbed 27 places over the next 3 weeks to reach a peak of number 8, thus becoming the group's first Top 10 hit in their home country."@en ;

George Harrison handles the verses, and there are also two excellent bridges featuring Roy Orbison and Bob Dylan.

However, plans were changed when Island Def Jam Music head L.A. Reid suggested to Carey she record a few more strong songs to ensure the album's success, therefore \"It's Like That\" was written and chosen as the album's lead-single, being released on January 7, 2005. \"It's Like That\" is a hip-hop song featuring ad-libs by the song's producer Jermaine Dupri and Fatman Scoop, while its lyrics discuss about a celebration, free of stress, strife and sadness, where Carey's alter-ego \"Mimi\" is being emancipated. The song received generally favorable reviews from music critics, most of whom noted its catchiness and carefree message. It was also nominated for a 2006 Grammy Award for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance. Commercially, the song charted well worldwide, becoming a top twenty hit in several countries, including the United States, while peaking inside the top-ten in over five other countries. The song's music video, directed by Brett Ratner, was filmed as a two-part story with \"We Belong Together\", featuring Carey at her bachelorette party, while getting ready to marry Eric Roberts and falling in love with a party guest and ex-lover, played by Wentworth Miller.

	dbo:abstract	"\"It's Like That\" is a song by American hip hop group Run\u2013D.M.C. It was first released in 1983 on a cassette backed with the track \"Sucker M.C.'s\". The release marked the start of Run-D.M.C.'s career and is widely regarded as ushering in a new school of hip hop artists with a street image and an abrasive, minimalist sound that marked them out from their predecessors. Both tracks were collected on the trio's eponymous debut album in 1984. \"It's like That\" is about life in the area where the group lives (unemployment, prices, death, etc.). Despite protesting those social and political problems, the song takes on a hopeful message encouraging listeners to abandon prejudice and to believe in themselves. In 2001, parts of the song was sampled in Jagged Edge's \"Let's Get Married (Remix)\" featuring Run-D.M.C.. The single was an international success. The song was remixed by house DJ Jason Nevins in 1997. His remix, originally a bootleg, was picked up for official release in 1997, and became a sleeper hit in 1998. It sold around five million copies worldwide, placing it amongst the biggest selling singles of all time, although Nevins was only paid some $5,000 for his remix. In 2008, it was ranked number 40 on VH1's 100 Greatest Hip-Hop Songs."@en ;

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jimmy_(song)>	rdf:type	dbo:MusicalWork ;
	dbo:abstract	"\"Jimmy\" is a song recorded by British artist M.I.A. for her second studio album, Kala (2007). The song was written by Maya \"M.I.A.\" Arulpragasam, Dave \"Switch\" Taylor and Bappi Lahiri and produced by Switch and M.I.A.. A cover of \"Jimmy Jimmy Jimmy Aaja\" from the film Disco Dancer (1982), the song was re-arranged as an uptempo pop-electro tune with disco influences by modifying the orchestration, instrumentation and beats and the addition of original English lyrics for the single. During the recording and production sessions, M.I.A. and Switch wanted to create a dance-pop disco record using a song that the singer was familiar with from her childhood; the song's lyrics portray M.I.A. being invited by British journalist Ben Anderson on a date while covering a genocide tour across nations in Africa, and both eventually pursuing a romantic relationship. \"Jimmy Jimmy Jimmy Aaja\" was itself inspired by \"T'es OK /(You're OK for international markets)\" (1980) from French Euro disco group Ottawan. Following the moderate chart performance of \"Boyz\", \"Jimmy\" was released in Japan in July 2007 as the album's lead single, and the second single in other countries. XL Recordings distributed \"Jimmy\" in CD single, 7\" and 12\" formats in the UK on 10 November 2007, however the song leaked in the country prior to release while the singer was on tour. Despite this, the song topped the UK Indie Chart and charted in Greece and Japan where it was a major commercial success. The single began to gain traction on the US Billboard Hot Dance Club Songs chart, peaking at number twenty eight following nine weeks on the chart. \"Jimmy\" was well received by contemporary music critics, who cited its distinct 1970s style pop sound compared with most songs featured on the album, and complimented its hook and lyrical themes. The bassline has similarities with the hook of Blur's hit single \"Girls & Boys\". Stylus magazine placed \"Jimmy\" at number 5 on their list of the \"Top 50 Songs of 2007\"."@en ;

dbr:Like_a_Rolling_Stone	rdf:type	dbo:MusicalWork ;
	dbo:abstract	"\"Like a Rolling Stone\" is a 1965 song by the American singer-songwriter Bob Dylan. Its confrontational lyrics originated in an extended piece of verse Dylan wrote in June 1965, when he returned exhausted from a grueling tour of England. Dylan distilled this draft into four verses and a chorus. \"Like a Rolling Stone\" was recorded a few weeks later as part of the sessions for the forthcoming album Highway 61 Revisited. During a difficult two-day preproduction, Dylan struggled to find the essence of the song, which was demoed without success in 3/4 time. A breakthrough was made when it was tried in a rock music format, and rookie session musician Al Kooper improvised the organ riff for which the track is known. However, Columbia Records was unhappy with both the song's length at over six minutes and its heavy electric sound, and was hesitant to release it. It was only when a month later a copy was leaked to a new popular music club and heard by influential DJs that the song was put out as a single. Although radio stations were reluctant to play such a long track, \"Like a Rolling Stone\" reached number two in the US Billboard charts (number one in Cashbox) and became a worldwide hit. Critics have described the track as revolutionary in its combination of different musical elements, the youthful, cynical sound of Dylan's voice, and the directness of the question \"How does it feel?\" \"Like a Rolling Stone\" transformed Dylan's image from folk singer to rock star, and is considered one of the most influential compositions in postwar popular music. Rolling Stone magazine listed the song at number one in their \"500 Greatest Songs of All Time\" list. The song has been covered by numerous artists, from The Jimi Hendrix Experience and The Rolling Stones to The Wailers and Green Day. At an auction in 2014, Dylan's handwritten lyrics to the song fetched $2 million, a world record for a popular music manuscript."@en ;
