It was released on October 6, 1992 by EMI Latin to coincide with his English-language self-titled debut album, which was released in April 1992. The idea to release an all Spanish-language album was pitched by Secada's music mentor Emilio Estefan, after realizing that SBK Records have yet released such an album. Estefan presented Secada's proposal for a Spanish-language recording to the head of Capitol EMI Records Charles Koppelman and then president of EMI Latin Jose Behar. Koppelman accepted the proposal after Behar stated that he could see \"market potential\" for Secada. With the help of Emilio's wife, Gloria Estefan, Secada translated selected compositions from his English-language debut album for Otro D\u00EDa M\u00E1s Sin Verte. The album spawned five singles; its titular track, \"Angel\", \"Cree En Nuestro Amor\", \"Sentir\", and \"Tiempo Al Tiempo\". The first four singles peaked at number one on the US Billboard Hot Latin Tracks chart, becoming the first Latin artist to do so. Secada held the record for most number ones from a single album, until Spanish Latin pop singer Enrique Iglesias broke the record in 1997. Secada became the first Hispanic artist of color to have a number one song on the Hot Latin Tracks chart. The album peaked at number four on the US Billboard Latin Pop Albums chart and number eight on the US Billboard Top Latin Albums chart.

Skor-Piony was the second album to be recorded with legendary Greek producer Stefanos Korkolis. The album presents an overall harder and more varied sound than the previous AleAda. The title, Skor-Piony, is a word play in Russian that translates to \"Scor-Peonies\", a blend of scorpion and peonies. The first letter has been interchanged with the Latin S instead of the Cyrillic \u0421, hence the true Russian spelling being '\u0421\u043A\u043E\u0440-\u041F\u0438\u043E\u043D\u044B'. Without the hyphen, the title spells out 'scorpions'. Meanwhile \"\u043F\u0438\u043E\u043D\u044B\" (Piony) translates to 'peonies'. Although some meaning will be lost through translation, the Russian title in its entirety can be interpreted as \"peonies like dangerous scorpions\". Linda explained that she came up with this play on words to show the danger in beauty, and also the beauty in danger: Fans have speculated that the \"\u0441\u043A\u043E\u0440\" (skor) may be stand for \"\u0421. \u041A\u043E\u0440\" (S. Kor), an acronym for Stefanos Korkolis' name, a person whom she is very close to. The first radio single from the album was \"Chyorno-snezhnaya\" released in February 2008. However, with only 70 plays, the single did not chart well, peaking at #184 on the Airplay Detection TopHit100 charts. The second single was \"Skor-Piony\" and the first single of the album to have a promotional video. The video debuted on the official Linda website in mid-March 2008 and was filmed by famed Greek directors who has done music videos for U2."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Save Rock and Roll is the fifth studio album by the American rock band Fall Out Boy. It was produced by Butch Walker and released April 12, 2013, through Island Records. On October 15, the album was re-released with PAX AM Days, an extended play the band recorded shortly after Save Rock and Roll's release. Following multiple touring stints, the members of Fall Out Boy decided to take a break at the end of 2009. During the hiatus, each member of the group pursued individual musical interests. The band felt it necessary to \"decompress\" and refrained from referring to the hiatus as a \"breakup\", acknowledging a possible return in the future. After several reformation attempts the album was recorded in secrecy at Rubyred Recordings in Santa Monica, California, beginning in the fall of 2012. The album sessions were marked by a desire to reinvent the band's sound in a more modern form. The band brought in producer Butch Walker for a fresh approach, marking their first time without longtime producer Neal Avron. In the band's new form, each member of the quartet was involved in crafting the compositions, although sessions were initially difficult as they struggled to reconnect. Save Rock and Roll features guest vocals from Foxes, Big Sean, Courtney Love, and Elton John (who sings on the album's title track). The band filmed music videos for every song on the album, which were eventually compiled and released as The Young Blood Chronicles in 2014. Save Rock and Roll debuted at number one on the U.S. Billboard 200 with 154,000 first week sales, earning the band their second career number one. Its top 20 lead single, \"My Songs Know What You Did in the Dark (Light Em Up)\", has achieved triple-platinum certification in the U.S. and charted worldwide. Rolling Stone described the band's comeback as a \"rather stunning renaissance\", and the record received positive reviews upon its release, although most music critics were hesitant to refer to the album as solely a rock record. The group followed the record release with the Save Rock and Roll arena tour in promotion, with multiple European, US and Australian legs announced, as well as worldwide promotional shows, festival appearances and TV performances. In 2014, Fall Out Boy and Paramore headlined Monumentour, a US arena concert tour before releasing the first single from their next album."@en ;

Although it was released during the active lifespan of the 2000-2003 King Crimson \"Double Duo\" lineup (and following two albums featuring this lineup, The ConstruKction of Light and the live Heavy ConstruKction), Vrooom Vrooom is compiled from recordings by the previous six-man line-up of the band (the \"Double Trio\" which lasted from 1994 to 1997). This is because the album was intended as a wider commercial release combining two previous releases which had been made available on more limited media in 1999. Disc 1 of Vrooom Vrooom is taken predominantly from the same recordings as the 1999 live album Live in Mexico City (originally made available exclusively as a Windows Media Audio download). The eleventh track on the disc, \"Biker Babes of the Rio Grande\", is an alternative version of the track \"Fearless and Highly Thrakked\", featured on Thrakattak (1996) (track 2) and King Crimson on Broadway (2-CD set) (1999) (disc 2, track 12). Disc 2 of Vrooom Vrooom derives mostly from the same recordings as the 1999 live album King Crimson on Broadway (originally released as the July 1999 disc in the subscriber-only King Crimson Collectors' Club release schedule)."@en ;

dbr:Genuine_Negro_Jig	rdf:type	schema:MusicAlbum ;
	dbo:abstract	"Genuine Negro Jig is the fifth studio album of the Carolina Chocolate Drops, one of the few African-American string bands playing today. Its label debut was released on February 16, 2010, while its vinyl version, which included the album on 140-gram vinyl and CD, was released on July 13. This is the first album the band has recorded for Nonesuch Records. It was highly successful, reaching the top ten on the Billboard Folk chart and the top of the Bluegrass chart. It was also the last CCD recording to include collaborator and Sankofa Strings co-founder, Sule Greg Wilson. Like most of the Carolina Chocolate Drops' work, the album, a mixture of traditional folk songs, early 20th \"Race\" music, and recent pieces, is part of the Chocolate Drops' effort to celebrate the string band music of the Piedmont region of North and South Carolina, and the influence of African-Americans on this music. On NPR, band member Rhiannon Giddens pointed out that \"it seems that two things get left out of the history books. One, that there was string band music in the Piedmont, period. (And that) black folk was such a huge part of string tradition.\u201D Although the music the Chocolate Drops play is quite eclectic, the band members claim that early 20th-century African American string bands also drew from a wide range of genres in their musical repertoire. In describing the music, Giddens discusses how she was inspired but not bound by the genres in which she works\u2014\"Tradition is a guide, not a jailer. We play in an older tradition but we are modern musicians.\" Genuine Negro Jig was well received by critics. Blogcritics writes that \"our ears are all the better for it\" and is \"hoping that this record will not only put the Carolina Chocolate Drops on the map, but will also draw new listeners in to the genres of old country and blues.\" Engine 145 describes Genuine Negro Jig as \"an album of feistily complex, yet endearingly soulful songs that have ages of history behind them and a bright future as well.\" Paste magazine calls the Chocolate Drops \"the genuine article\" whose \"enthusiasm for the tradition is obvious.\" The Guardian writes that the album is \"well worth checking out.\" The album won a 2010 Grammy in the best traditional folk album category, and was number 9 in fRoots magazine's top 10 albums of the year."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Message from Beat Street: The Best of Grandmaster Flash, Melle Mel & the Furious Five is a 1994 CD compilation album released on the Rhino Entertainment record label in the US. It consists of tracks recorded by the various versions of Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five and Grandmaster Melle Mel. No tracks from the three Grandmaster Flash albums on Elektra Records are included or anything from the 1988 comeback album On the Strength. The fold-out booklet contains an essay by Shannita Williams, Rap Editor of Hits Magazine. Strangely, it also features two unrelated photos of the later Grandmaster Flash line-up. In addition the credits state that all the tracks are taken from the original Sugar Hill Records 12\" singles, although in several cases often unnecessary fade edits have been made (see below). These are not present on the future compilation albums Adventures on the Wheels of Steel (1999) or Grandmaster Flash, Melle Mel and the Furious Five: The Definitive Groove Collection (2006). No explanation is provided for this. The credits also state that the group titles \"are authentic to the original 12\" labels and illustrate the variations and inconsistencies with regard to artist listings\". However, the majority of the original releases do not use ampersands. Finally, Rahiem's name is misspelled throughout as Raheem."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"The Icicle Works is the eponymous debut album by The Icicle Works. The album was released in 1984 and charted at number 24 in the UK and number 40 in the US. The original 1984 issue features different track listings and cover artwork in the UK, in the USA, and in Canada. In 2006, Beggars Banquet Records issued both a 2-CD and a limited edition 3-CD expanded edition of The Icicle Works. Disc 1 consists of the original album in its entirety, in the UK configuration. Disc 2 features a selection of b-sides, radio sessions, and remixes, as well as one live track. On the 3-CD edition, the first 10 tracks of disc 3 consist of \"radio session\" versions of the songs from the original UK Icicle Works album; they are presented in the original UK album sequence. Disc 3 then concludes with a previously released b-side, and a previously unreleased album outtake. The US version of the album has a remixed and re-titled version of Birds Fly (Whisper to a Scream). The US remix does not include the female spoken introduction heard on the UK mix. The US album was released by Arista Records. Pitchfork Media described the song \"Love Is a Wonderful Colour\" as \"one of those \"wow where was this hiding?\" tracks that make you think there's something left to 80s crate-digging.\""@en ;

In a story attributed to Phil Marino, known for his work photographing the band, the Gigolo Aunts became acquainted with the song through Rob Norris, the producer of their debut album, Everybody Happy. Norris, a former member of the Bongos and at the time a current member of the Wizards, reportedly sent a tape of the six song EP to the Gigolo Aunts, who recorded \"Flippin' Out\" as the title track for the album.

	dbo:abstract	"This article is a list of the episodes of the Japanese anime series Phantom ~Requiem for the Phantom~, which is animated by Bee Train and directed by Koichi Mashimo under the Project Phantom group. The series went on air on April 2, 2009 on TV Tokyo. Subsequently the show also aired on AT-X, TV Aichi, and TV Osaka. Funimation Entertainment is streaming the series for its North American audience. The anime is based on the 2000 video game Phantom of Inferno. The series is about a Japanese national who gets kidnapped by an assassin syndicate called Inferno after he had personally witnessed an assassination while visiting the United States. Inferno is a criminal organization attempting to unite all known underworld mob gangs into one conglomerate. In order to achieve their goal, Inferno deploys its assassin operatives codenamed Phantom. Among them is an amnesiac girl named Ein and the Japanese national, who was given the name Zwei as his codename after being brainwashed of his previous memory. The anime's plot is more complex than the video game as there are underlying meanings and symbolism involved but they are thoroughly explained in detail in the episodes list below as not understanding these will result in the ending making no sense and being ambiguous to the viewer. An announcement regarding the show was first announced in the January issue of Kadokawa Shoten's Newtype magazine with Yoshimitsu Yamashita, Mutsumi Sasaki and Yoko Kikuchi being the main animators with Bee Train being in charge of animation. Soon afterwards, a promotional video of Phantom ~Requiem of the Phantom~ was broadcast on Biglobe. Music for the series is created under Masumi It\u014D, using the alias Hikaru Nanase. For the first 19 episodes, the opening song \"Karma\" is written and sung by Kokia and arranged by Hikaru Nanase, with the ending song \"Jigoku no Mon\" (\u5730\u7344\u306E\u9580 Gates of Hell) is sung by Ali Project with CD singles released.

	dbo:abstract	"As Can\u00E7\u00F5es de Eu Tu Eles (The songs of \"Me, You, Them\") is an album released by Brazilian singer-songwriter Gilberto Gil in 2001. The album is the soundtrack for the 2000 film Eu Tu Eles directed by Andrucha Waddington, starred by Regina Cas\u00E9, Lima Duarte, St\u00EAnio Garcia and Luiz Carlos Vasconcelos. Set in Russas, the film is about a countywoman who lives together with her three husbands and two children in the arid backlands of the northeast of Brazil. At the 2000 Cannes Film Festival it earned a \"Special Distinction\" in the Un Certain Regard section. Waddington asked Gil to record the album, which also became Gil's tribute to Luiz Gonzaga \"The King of the Bai\u00E3o\", recording songs previously released by Gonzaga, such as \"Assum Preto,\" \"Asa Branca,\" \"Juazeiro,\" and \"Qui Nem Jil\u00F3\". Gil also wrote songs especially for this movie soundtrack, \"As Pegadas do Amor\" and \"Lamento Sertanejo\". The first single released, \"Esperando Na Janela\", became a hit in Brazil in 2000. There is also a song recorded by Gil on his album Dia Dorim, Noite Neon (1995), \"Casinha Feliz\", that is recreated and closes the album, which was recorded in ten days. The album was named by Phillip Jandovsk\u00FD of Allmusic one of Gil's best since the 1970s and a \"very authentic and down-to-earth tribute to the old masters of the popular music of the Brazilian Northeast region.\" Alvaro Neder, also of Allmusic, referred to the music on the album as \"delicious\", with the songs \"filled with the genuine soul of the suffering northeast.\" As Can\u00E7\u00F5es de Eu Tu Eles received a Latin Grammy Award nomination for Album of the Year and was awarded for Best Brazilian Roots/Regional Album. The song \"Esperando Na Janela\" earned the Latin Grammy for Best Brazilian Song and was nominated for Record of the Year."@en ;

The album is predominantly Naija Hip hop in genre, but incorporates elements of other musical styles such as dancehall and afrobeat. It was the most anticipated Nigerian release of 2011,[citation needed] as Ice Prince had collected a huge amount of popularity from his singles \"Oleku\" and \"Superstar\".

It was produced by Joe Henry and features various guest artists, including Brad Mehldau, Joshua Redman and Nicholas Payton. The album title is taken from the 1963 Thelonious Monk song of the same name and features a new version of the song. The album is a unique juxtaposition of modern and traditional jazz tunes with stylistic cues drawn from both worlds. In an interview shortly after it was released, Nick Spitzer noted that \"there's a parade beat to it, a bit of a strut and shuffle. Are you merging the worlds of Monk and Toussaint?\u201D \u201CWell, there's no way around that,\u201D Toussaint replied. Though mostly known for R&B, this is Toussaint's second jazz album. The first was Allen Toussaint's Jazzity Project: Going Places, released online through cdbaby in 2004. Critic Stephen Thomas Erlewine gave it a very favorable review on Allmusic, saying it \"stands alone among Toussaint albums\"."@en ;

The duo continued recording intermittently until late 2012, when large parts of the album were recorded. Influenced by film soundtracks from the 1970s, Tomorrow's Harvest features a more downtempo form of ambient music, similar to Boards of Canada's earlier releases. Tomorrow's Harvest's announcement was surrounded by a cryptic marketing campaign that began on Record Store Day 2013 with the release of an unannounced non-album single, \"------ / ------ / ------ / XXXXXX / ------ / ------\", which featured part of an unidentified code. A further five codes were released interim through various media and culminated in users gaining access to a new website containing information about the upcoming release. Tomorrow's Harvest was the first new music released by Boards of Canada in seven years, since Trans Canada Highway (2006). Upon its release, the album received critical acclaim and high international chart placings."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"The First Time Ever (I Saw Your Face) is an album by American pop singer Johnny Mathis that was released on May 10, 1972, by Columbia Records and continues in the tradition set by his recent studio releases of covering mostly current chart hits. It made its first appearance on Billboard magazine's Top LP's & Tapes chart in the issue dated June 10, 1972, and remained there for 15 weeks, peaking at number 71. The album was released as a DTS Surround Sound CD on May 23, 2000. The reason for the selection of this particular album for DTS release is suggested in a message in the liner notes from the CD's producer, Patricia Miller: \"I dedicate this to the memory of my loving Brad. Thank you for all the strength and passion you gave me during our time together and forever. These love songs tell a story of our everlasting love.\""@en ;

Remiddi articulated feelings of disconnectedness when discussing the record and life on-tour. \"In a way, growing up in Italy, then living for 12 years in London, and now two and a half years in New York, made me realize that I have some dear friends I rarely see,\" explains Remiddi. \"I was touring almost non-stop for eight months and I started having these imaginary conversations in my head with people I wanted to communicate with, but for one reason or another it couldn't happen.

Martin is not pictured on the album because of her departure earlier in the year; although her vocals are present on the majority of the recordings on the album (as well as other recordings made during that period), she never received any royalties from album sales. She does have a spoken interlude line (as do the other group members) on the bridge of the song \"(He's) Seventeen\", and also sings lead on \"After All\", a song recorded for but not originally included on the album. Along with these songs, Ballard and Wilson are heard out front on other songs as well. Wilson sings lead on \"The Tears\" (another former non-album track) and \"Baby Don't Go\"; Ballard has leads on a handful of songs as well (see below), including \"Buttered Popcorn\" and the short intro line to \"Let Me Go the Right Way\". None of these singles charted within the top 40 of the Billboard Pop Singles chart, leading to the group being referred to around the Motown offices as the \"no-hit\" Supremes. By the time of their next LP, Where Did Our Love Go, the Supremes would have two top 40 hits to their name, one of them, \"Where Did Our Love Go\", a number-one hit. Meet The Supremes was originally issued only in monaural sound. A stereo remix of the album, with a new cover, was issued along with the original mono version in 1965. Additionally, a deluxe two compact disc edition was released by Hip-O Select in the spring of 2010, which included both the mono and stereo versions of the album, as well as several outtakes, non-album tracks and live performances. The original album track order contained ten songs. Side 1: Your Heart Belongs To Me; Who's Lovin' You; Baby Don't Go; Buttered Popcorn; I Want A Guy. Side 2: The Boy That Got Away; You Bring Back Memories; Play A Sad Song; Never Again; (He's) Seventeen. This configuration was withdrawn to include the current hit, \"Let Me Go The Right Way\" and the B-side, \"Time Changes Things\". \"The Boy That Got Away\" was withdrawn from the line-up, giving the album 11 tracks. [Deluxe Version \"Meet The Supremes\" 2010]. Though the album made little to no impact on the US album charts, in 1962, when it was released in the UK in 1964 it managed to peak at #8 on the UK Albums Chart, with some versions of the UK album having a slightly different track listing which featured some songs from their next album Where Did Our Love Go."@en ;

While the band members wanted Steve Lillywhite to produce, Sire chose Graham Gouldman in an attempt to gain popularity through a well-known recording manager. The recording process brought about many conflicts between band members, most notably the strife between Joey Ramone and Johnny Ramone, where Johnny began dating one of Joey's ex-girlfriends. There were also disputes about the overall genre of the album, with Johnny leaning towards hard rock and Joey towards pop music. Ultimately, the album incorporated a high production value and a variation of tone throughout the album. Pleasant Dreams featured songs such as \"We Want the Airwaves,\" \"She's a Sensation,\" and \"Come On Now,\" strayed from traditional punk rock and took on different styles. The album was not commercially acclaimed, which came as a surprise to Sire since they had insisted the band record with Gouldman in an effort to increase fan-base; it peaked at number fifty-eight on the Billboard 200 and only charted outside of the US in Sweden. The album was not critically acclaimed either, as it received several mixed articles by reviewers, who insisted the album to be less playable than their first four albums."@en ;

It expanded their popularity and found them moving into a pop punk and pop rock direction musically. The album's most popular tracks were a new version of \"Surfer Girl,\" a song which had originally appeared on their debut album That's Business and \"Suffer\" which also appeared on Geffen sampler Everything is Beautiful. Act Your Age would be the band's final recording with their original lineup, as guitarist Ian Cone left the band shortly after its release. The album contains a hidden track called \"Too Many Stops\" on track 15 after \"Reflections.\" The song plays at 22:59 into the track and is followed by a 1-minute clip of the band members laughing uncontrollably. Act Your Age was Home Grown's first album to chart; reaching #24 on Billboard's Heatseekers in 1998."@en ;

It consists of vocal noises by Patton himself. The 34 tracks are not considered singing in any conventional sense, as they consist mainly of Patton shouting, screaming, clapping, squeaking and moaning. These elements were then spliced and edited in a fashion that resulted in a dramatic ebb and flow of bizarre, albeit organic sounding compositions. The compositions do not adhere to traditional song structure. Mike Patton stated that Japanese noise band Hanatarash's album Aids - A - Delic inspired this release.[citation needed]"@en ;

The lyrics and title of \".44 Caliber Love Letter\" are influenced by a line from the iconic 1986 David Lynch movie Blue Velvet: \"I'll have to send you a love letter! Straight from my heart, fucker! You know what a love letter is? It's a bullet from a fucking gun, fucker!\" Another Lynch film, Eraserhead, is mentioned by name in \"Where No One Knows\".

A continuation of Welcome to My Nightmare as it continues the story of Steven, this concept album was written almost exclusively by Cooper with guitar player Dick Wagner and producer Bob Ezrin. With the success of \u201COnly Women Bleed\u201D from his first solo effort, Alice continued with the rock ballads on this album. \u201CI Never Cry\u201D was written about his drinking problem, which would in one year send the performer into rehab and affect all his subsequent music up to and including 1983\u2019s DaDa. Cooper called the song \u201Can alcoholic confession\u201D. The \u201CAlice Cooper Goes To Hell\u201D tour of 1976 was completely cancelled prior to commencement due to Cooper suffering from anemia at the time. However, \u201CGo to Hell\u201D proved the last song until his big hit \u201CPoison\u201D to become a consistent part of Cooper\u2019s live setlists, being performed on most tours to the present. \u201CI Never Cry\u201D was also regularly performed in the late 1970s and during the 2000s, whilst \u201CGuilty\u201D was performed regularly on the Flush the Fashion and Special Forces tours and occasionally during the 2000s and \u201CWish You Were Here\u201D frequently played on the tours for the following two albums.

The word anderster does not officially exist within the German language and could be considered a neologism or a grammatically incorrect construction.

The album was, as its title alludes to, an overt comeback attempt for Sly Stone. However, the album and its singles, \"Remember Who You Are\" and \"The Same Thing (Makes You Laugh, Makes You Cry)\", failed to live up to expectations. Some of the original Family Stone members, including Cynthia Robinson, Pat Rizzo, Freddie Stone, and Rose Stone, make contributions to this album. Back on the Right Track is the first Sly Stone album not to be produced by the artist; Mark Davis was in charge of the project. Back on the Right Track and the following studio release, Ain't But the One Way, were combined by Rhino Records into a compilation called Who in the Funk Do You Think You Are: The Warner Bros.

	dbo:abstract	"Christmas Album is a late-1968 album by Herb Alpert & the Tijuana Brass. It was the group's eleventh release. The LP edition of the album was issued twice. The original edition had the cover photography filling the front and back sides of the album jacket. For the reissue, the photos were reduced to half size and placed in the center of a white background. Although the Brass' albums were out of print for a good many years, the Christmas Album was released on CD in the 1980s (with the CD release sporting the altered cover artwork), with annual reappearances in record stores at Christmastime. The album was re-released again on CD by the Shout!Factory label in 2006 as were many of the other Tijuana Brass albums. The Shout!Factory release restored the original artwork to the front cover and featured the original back cover on the included CD booklet. Another CD re-release occurred on October 23, 2015 (Herb Alpert Presents label, remastered), this time restoring the original artwork to the front and back. The album contains a mixture of popular Christmas-season music, mostly American secular standards. Exceptions include the Bach piece \"Jesu, Joy of Man's Desiring,\" and a traditional Hispanic number, \"Las Ma\u00F1anitas.\" The latter song's arrangement, provided by marimbist Julius Wechter, is near identical to one used by Wechter's Baja Marimba Band several years earlier, on their 1965 album For Animals Only. The songs's title literally means \"The Little Mornings;\" the song is traditionally sung on the morning of one's birthday celebration, or the day of a religious figure such as a saint (or, in this case, Jesus). The cover features the image of Alpert, who is Jewish, dressed as Santa Claus while playing his trumpet. Collaborating with Alpert in the production was his usual cadre of musicians: Nick Ceroli (drums/percussion), Bob Edmondson (trombone), Tonni Kalash (trumpet), Lou Pagani (keyboards), John Pisano (guitars/mandolin) and Pat Senatore (bass). Perennial sideman, Julius Wechter, appears on marimba and percussion. Alpert provides lead vocals on \"The Christmas Song\" and \"The Bell That Couldn't Jingle,\" and there are also appearances by a studio choir and string instruments, arranged by Shorty Rogers."@en ;

The album saw the group reunite with producers Dallas Austin and Kenneth \"Babyface\" Edmonds as well as new collaborators Organized Noize and Chucky Thompson, the album also featured contributions from Sean \"Puffy\" Combs who helped with the notable hip hop soul sound. An R&B and hip hop soul album, CrazySexyCool featured hip-hop beats, funk, deep grooves, propulsive rhythms and smooth production. The album's lyrical content was seen as a departure from the group's debut and was seen as a coming-of-age project which explored themes sexuality, romanticism, inexperience and youthful optimism. The album was met with critical acclaim and commercial success, debuting at number three on the Billboard 200 CrazySexyCool spent over two years on the Billboard album charts, and was certified Diamond by the RIAA, making TLC the first girl group in history to be awarded diamond status.

Although \"I Let Her Lie\" and \"Too Much Fun\" were both Top 5 country hits, the album only peaked at #44 on Top Country Albums. Alanna Nash of Entertainment Weekly gave the album a B+ rating, saying that Singletary \"mines familiar honky-tonk sources on this stylish debut, but he has a terrific presence and a knack for inhabiting a lyric.\""@en ;

dbr:End_of_the_Century	rdf:type	schema:MusicAlbum ;
	dbo:abstract	"End of the Century is the fifth studio album by the American punk rock band the Ramones, released on February 4, 1980, through Sire Records. The album was the band's first produced by Phil Spector, though he had offered the band his assistance earlier in their career. With Spector fully producing the album, it was the first release that excluded original member Tommy Ramone, who in 1978 left the band but produced their previous album Road to Ruin . Spector used more advanced standards of engineering, such as high-quality overdubbing and echo chambers. These methods caused conflict between the band and Spector, since much of the recording used techniques that opposed those the Ramones had previously used. Spector emphasized the production value as well, working with a budget of around $200,000. The songs on End of the Century were written primarily to expand the band's fan-base, straying from the band's original punk genre and steering toward a more pop oriented sound. The lyrics on the album deal with various different things, ranging from drug addictions to the band's lifestyle while touring. The album also features a cover of The Ronettes' piece \"Baby, I Love You,\" as well as successors to previous Ramones songs \"Judy Is a Punk\" and \"Havana Affair.\" It received generally positive reviews from critics, though many reviewers deemed it to be less enjoyable compared to the band's previous releases. Despite this, the album is the highest charting Ramones album of all time, reaching number 44 on the US Billboard 200 chart, and number 14 on the UK Albums Chart. End of the Century spawned the singles \"Baby, I Love You\" and \"Do You Remember Rock 'n' Roll Radio?.\" The album's title is taken from a couplet repeated in the first track \"Do You Remember Rock 'n' Roll Radio?\": \"It's the end, the end of the seventies / It's the end, the end of the century.\""@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"From Conception: Live 1981 is a live album by American heavy metal band Dokken, released in 2007. This album contains rare live recordings allegedly from 1981, before the band released its first album Breaking the Chains. However, the performance is more likely to be from December 1983, as the set list exactly matches known set lists from that time. Moreover, Jeff Pilson is listed as the bass guitar player on the recording, something that could not have been possible in 1981 since Juan Croucier played bass guitar for the group until after 1982. The song \"Live to Rock\" is featured on this album under this title, but in 1981 this song had different lyrics and was known under the title \"We're Illegal\". Finally, according to Pilson, the recording is actually from a King Biscuit Flower Hour broadcast from December 1983.[citation needed] Why the album has been marketed as being from 1981 is unknown. There are three previously unreleased songs included on the album: \"Goin' Down\", \"Hit and Run\" and \"You're a Liar\", as well slightly rearranged versions of some tracks from the Breaking the Chains album such as \"Paris Is Burning\", \"Breakin' the Chains\" or \"Night Rider\"."@en ;

During the group's last years with Motown, the label struggled to come up with material for the group. As a result, the Jackson 5 fell into a period from 1973 to 1974 where they scored no Top 10 singles. By this point, most of the Jackson 5's members, and their manager/father Joseph Jackson, were vocally complaining about the group's direction, with Michael Jackson becoming the most vocal. The only member not to complain about Motown's handling of the act was Jermaine Jackson, who would marry Motown head Berry Gordy's daughter Hazel three months after the release of the album. G.I.T.: Get It Together would go on to sell over two million copies worldwide. The album was arranged by Arthur G. Wright, David Blumberg and James Anthony Carmichael."@en ;

It peaked at number 25 on the Billboard 200, selling more than 33,000 copies within its first week. It is the band's highest-selling album, and has sold more than 232,000 copies as of April 2008. The album has spawned two singles: \"The Latest Plague\" and \"Shame Shame\". A B-side, \"Save Us\", has since been released via the band's official Myspace. It is the last album to include lead vocalist Sonny Moore, who began his own solo project afterwards and now records as Skrillex, although in the band's reunion in 2013 Matt Good said in an interview that he was looking if Sonny would be interest in contribute in some way with their new EP. Wes Borland played bass on the album after Jon Weisberg was forced to leave the band in 2005."@en ;

dbr:Hier_sind_die_Onkelz	rdf:type	schema:MusicAlbum ;
	dbo:abstract	"Hier sind die Onkelz (German for This is the Onkelz) is the 11th album for German Hard rock band B\u00F6hse Onkelz. It was released in 1995 on Virgin Records and was the band's first release on a major label. The Onkelz also acted as the producer for the record. The recording took place at Tonstudio Ruessmann, Hennef, Germany. Making ofJust like the Bellaphon contract, the new contract with the Munich Virgin label (a subsidiary of EMI) was a contract for 3 studio albums with a live option for 4 years, going into effect in the spring of 1995. Virgin, a major label which enjoyed a very good reputation in the music business, had thoroughly checked out the B\u00F6hse Onkelz and came to the conclusion that the B\u00F6hse Onkelz were one of the best German rock bands and that all the accusations thrown at the band were unfounded. Udo Lange, the managing director at Virgin who made this courageous move, frequently had to defend himself. The reviews of their following releases and their totally sold-out concerts were proof that he had made a good decision to sign on the Onkelz. The album \u201CHier sind die Onkelz\u201D (Here are the Onkelz) came out on the market in the autumn of 1995 and within a few days marched straight to number 4 on the German Top 100 Media Control Longplay Charts. Along with the album, a single was released containing two bonus tracks not found on the album. The single \u201CFinde die Wahrheit\u201D (Find the truth), plus the bonus tracks \u201CBenutz mich\u201D (Use me) and \u201CWeiss\u201D (White). In addition, \u201CHier sind die Onkelz\u201D was available in a limited edition as a picture disc. The first 100 copies of this picture disc contained a typographical error. \u201COnkelz\u201D was inadvertently written as \u201COnklez\u201D, making this record a rarity within the fan community. BackgroundThe Record was the first work of the band, after singer Kevin Russell had given up heroin. His vocal performance was better than on previous albums. The record achieved favourable reviews from most music magazines, such as the German Metal Hammer and Rock Hard."@en ;

It consists of the full live set featuring a reunion of Thunders with fellow ex-New York Dolls and Heartbreakers drummer Jerry Nolan and ex-Dolls bassist Arthur \"Killer\" Kane, recorded at the Roxy Theatre in Los Angeles, California on January 4, 1987. Given Thunders' notoriety for performing in a smacked-out or alcoholic haze, this more sober and professional Thunders performance led one reviewer to declare the CD to contain \"an ample track selection, generally superb performances, and surprisingly good fidelity all in one package -- a Triple Crown rarely achieved in the world of J.T. live recordings.\" It would be the last time Kane would ever play with Thunders and Nolan, as the two musicians would pass away within a year of each other (Kane died of leukemia a month after playing a formal New York Dolls show with surviving members David Johansen and Sylvain Sylvain). The show was also filmed with a single VHS video camera and would become a popular bootleg amongst Thunders' fans; the footage was officially released, with the consent of Thunders' and Kane's estates, in November 2004 as the DVD Thunders, Nolan and Kane: You Can't Put Your Arms Around A Memory. This recording was concurrently released by Munster Records in Spain as Panic on Sunset Strip.

By June 1994, the album was certified Platinum by the RIAA for shipment in excess of one million units. The title of the album is taken from a lyric from its lead single, \"Cannonball\". The video for \"Cannonball\" was directed by Spike Jonze and Kim Gordon, and the video for \"Divine Hammer\" was directed by Jonze, Gordon and Richard Kern. The song \"Cannonball\" has been used in many movie trailers, including South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut and Dude, Where's My Car?. A looped guitar sample of \"S.O.S.\" was used by the English electronic music band The Prodigy in their 1996 hit single \"Firestarter\". A sample from \"I Just Wanna Get Along\" was used in another track by The Prodigy called \"World's on Fire\" from the Invaders Must Die album. In 2003, Pitchfork Media listed the album at #64 on their list of The Top 100 Albums of the 1990s. In May 2013, 4AD released LSXX, a deluxe 20th anniversary version of the album."@en ;

dbr:Living_in_the_Material_World	rdf:type	schema:MusicAlbum ;
	dbo:abstract	"Living in the Material World is the fourth studio album by English musician George Harrison, released in 1973 on Apple Records. As the follow-up to 1970's critically acclaimed All Things Must Pass and his pioneering charity project, the Concert for Bangladesh, it was among the most highly anticipated releases of that year. The album was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America two days after release, on its way to becoming Harrison's second number 1 album in the United States, and produced the international hit \"Give Me Love (Give Me Peace on Earth)\". It also topped albums charts in Canada and Australia, and reached number 2 in Britain. Living in the Material World is notable for the uncompromising lyrical content of its songs, reflecting Harrison's struggle for spiritual enlightenment against his status as a superstar, as well as for what many commentators consider to be the finest guitar and vocal performances of his career. In contrast with All Things Must Pass, Harrison scaled down the production for Material World, using a core group of musicians comprising Nicky Hopkins, Gary Wright, Klaus Voormann and Jim Keltner. Ringo Starr, John Barham and Indian musician Zakir Hussain were among the album's other contributors. Upon release, Rolling Stone described it as a \"pop classic\", a work that \"stands alone as an article of faith, miraculous in its radiance\". Most contemporary reviewers consider Living in the Material World to be a worthy successor to All Things Must Pass, even if it inevitably falls short of Harrison's grand opus. Author Simon Leng refers to the album as a \"forgotten blockbuster\", representing \"the close of an age, the last offering of the Beatles' London era\". EMI reissued the album in 2006, in remastered form with bonus tracks, and released a deluxe-edition CD/DVD set that included film clips of four songs."@en ;

Instead of the darkly polished dance-pop styling of earlier albums Soul Mining and Infected, Mind Bomb opens up the music to reveal a slow, winding textured world of sound, thanks in no small means to ex-Smiths guitarist Johnny Marr. Lyrical subjects include politics, religion, and romance. The band would also play a world tour and record a follow-up, Dusk. After that, Johnson dissolved it and went about his business alone again.

Robyn collaborated with producers including Lindstr\u00F6m & Ekh\u00E9, Christian Falk, Billy Mann, Thomas Rusiak and Masters at Work during its recording. A pop and R&B record, My Truth is an autobiographical album for which Robyn co-wrote all fourteen songs. Certain lyrics reflects on the abortion the singer had in the fall of 1998, which sparked controversy when RCA Records began formulating a North American release. When she refused to make alterations to the album per request by the label, the plans to release My Truth outside of Sweden were cancelled. Sweden-based music critics were generally positive towards My Truth and commended Robyn's growth as a songwriter. At the Swedish Grammis Awards in 2000, the album won the award for Female Pop/Rock Artist. Overseas critics were divided in their opinions of My Truth; they felt it was more mature than the singer's debut album Robyn Is Here (1995), but criticised the lack of catchy hooks. The album peaked at number two on the Sverigetopplistan albums chart and received a platinum certification by the Swedish Recording Industry Association (GLF). My Truth was supported by four singles\u2014\"Electric\", \"Play\", \"My Only Reason\" and \"Main Thing\".

Additionally, a limited edition CD EP of acoustic versions of songs from the album, entitled \u00D2ran M\u00F3r Session, was made available at the band's 2014 and 2015 tour dates. The EP was expanded with additional tracks and given a wide commercial release in October 2015. The album was released to overwhelmingly positive reviews, with Allmusic summarising the album as \"The Twilight Sad transform everything that came before into some of their most compelling music. By blending the extremes of their previous albums, they give intimate moments an epic scope in ways that sound truly revitalized... Equally desolate and majestic, Nobody Wants to Be Here and Nobody Wants to Leave's naked emotions and sophisticated music mark a new high point for the Twilight Sad.\""@en ;

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nonsuch_(album)>	rdf:type	schema:MusicAlbum ;
	dbo:abstract	"Nonsuch (styled as NONSVCH.) is the twelfth studio album by the English band XTC, released on 27 April 1992. In a 1992 MTV interview, Andy Partridge said that he had selected the name of the album after encountering a drawing of Nonsuch Palace and, thinking that the archaic word \"Nonsuch\" meant \"does not exist\" rather than, as he later learned, \"unique\". The album title may have derived from a couplet in the lyrics of the final song of Oranges and Lemons (their previous studio album) \"Chalkhills and Children\": The album was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Alternative Music Album. \"The Disappointed\" was nominated for an Ivor Novello award. The album reached No. 1 on the Rolling Stone College album chart and No. 97 on the Billboard album chart in the U.S. It was the band's second consecutive Top 30 success on the UK album chart, reaching 28. The album produced three singles: \"The Disappointed\" (which reached No. 33 on the UK singles chart), \"The Ballad of Peter Pumpkinhead\" (which reached No. 71 on the UK singles chart) and \"Wrapped In Grey\" (which, when withdrawn by Virgin, prompted the band to go on strike). Two promotional videos were made. A UK-only video for \"The Disappointed\" (the band also did a lip-sync performance of this song on Pebble Mill at One) and \"The Ballad of Peter Pumpkinhead,\" which received much airplay on MTV that summer. The band performed \"Books Are Burning\" live with drummer Dave Mattacks on The Late Show on BBC-TV in April 1992. The album cover is a picture of Nonsuch Palace in Surrey, from the book A Short History of Ewell and Nonsuch, by Cloudesley S. Willis. The palace no longer exists, but its former grounds included the present-day Nonsuch Park between Ewell and Cheam. New 2.0 stereo and 5.1 surround sound mixes from the original analogue tapes by Steven Wilson were released in 2013."@en ;

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/North_Atlantic_Drift_(album)>	rdf:type	schema:MusicAlbum ;
	dbo:abstract	"North Atlantic Drift is the sixth album by Ocean Colour Scene. The title track is political commentary on American cultural imperialism and its support by the UK government, particularly the then impending US-led invasion of Iraq, which was opposed by the majority of the British public. (OCS had shown their anti-war tendencies with the previous protest song Profit in Peace and associated with Paul Weller). \"Meanwhile Rome burns\" appears to be a reference to the September 11 Attacks, analogy with the Sacking of Rome, \"Between the Euphrates and the other river now the home of the Devil and the liar\" is a reference to Iraq and US President George W. Bush and British Prime Minister Tony Blair, respectively. The first track, I Just Need Myself was played by Virgin Radio and reached #13 in the charts, though the other two singles did less well but still charted inside the top 40. The folky Second Hand Car was released as a single in Germany and Holland. She's Been Writing is dedicated to Sandy Denny, one of Fowler's favourite bands being Fairport Convention The U.S. version was released on 19 August 2003, and contained four bonus tracks, all of which were b-sides to the U.K. single releases of \"I Just Need Myself.\" The album was released to a largely mixed-to-negative reception. It was the last album released with the original line up after Damon Minchella left the band in late 2003."@en ;

It was recorded over several days at the Colonial Theatre in Pittsfield, Massachusetts. The songs (chosen for the album) span over five decades. The premise for One Man Band is that instead of having a wide array of instruments, as with most concerts, Taylor is accompanied by only his guitar, while Larry Goldings plays piano. There are some exceptions to this concept, as the pre-recorded Tanglewood Festival Chorus accompanies Taylor on \"My Traveling Star\" and \"Shower the People\". Also, a \"drum machine\" (in this case, a large mechanical device that physically plays drums) made by Taylor and his friend Gordon Fairfield, also features on \"Slap Leather\" and \"Chili Dog\". Taylor also introduces many of the songs with humorous stories, accompanied by projected photographs. The digital discrete 5.1 surround sound mix of One Man Band won a TEC Award for best surround sound recording in 2008."@en ;

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pop_(U2_album)>	rdf:type	schema:MusicAlbum ;
	dbo:abstract	"Pop is the ninth studio album by Irish rock band U2. It was produced by Flood, Howie B, and Steve Osborne, and was released on 3 March 1997 on Island Records. The album was a continuation of the band's 1990s musical reinvention, as they incorporated alternative rock, techno, dance, and electronica influences into their sound. Pop employed a variety of production techniques that were relatively new to U2, including sampling, loops, programmed drum machines, and sequencing. Recording sessions began in 1995 with various record producers, including Nellee Hooper, Flood, Howie B, and Osborne, who were introducing the band to various electronica influences. At the time, drummer Larry Mullen, Jr. was inactive due to a back injury, prompting the other band members to take different approaches to songwriting. Upon Mullen's return, the band began re-working much of their material but ultimately struggled to complete songs. After the band allowed manager Paul McGuinness to book their upcoming 1997 PopMart Tour before the record was completed, they felt rushed into delivering it. Even after delaying the album's release date from the 1996 Christmas and holiday season to March 1997, U2 ran out of time in the studio, working up to the last minute to complete songs. In February 1997, U2 released Pop's techno-heavy lead single, \"Discoth\u00E8que\", one of six singles from the album. The record initially received favourable reviews from critics and reached number one in 35 countries, including the United Kingdom and the United States. However, the album's lifetime sales are among the lowest in U2's catalogue, and it received only a single platinum certification by the Recording Industry Association of America. Retrospectively, the album is viewed by the music press and public as a disappointment. The finished product was not to U2's liking, and they subsequently re-recorded and remixed many of the songs for single and compilation album releases."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Scream, Dracula, Scream! is an album by the San Diego, California rock band Rocket from the Crypt, released in 1995 by Interscope Records. It was the band's first major-label release. Music videos were filmed for the singles \"On a Rope,\" \"Born in '69\" and \"Young Livers,\" and the band embarked on extensive tours of the US, UK and Europe. They experienced a surge of popularity in the UK, where \"On a Rope\" entered music charts at #12 and was a hit on MTV Europe, earning them rave reviews in New Musical Express and allowing them to play Top of the Pops. The album also made the band an alternative rock hit in the US, where their videos were featured on MTV and the album received many positive reviews in both mainstream and underground music presses. A large headlining tour in support of the album ensued in 1996, as well as supporting tours with Rancid and Soundgarden. During these tours the band gained a reputation for a series of interesting and, at times, seemingly ludicrous gimmicks and stage antics which included holding raffles during live performances, spinning a large game show wheel to determine set lists, onstage fire breathing, annual Halloween and New Year's shows, and the wearing of coordinated and progressively more ornate stage costumes. In Europe the band also hosted a German variety show, played children's shows and morning shows, and did interviews with fashion magazines. While unorthodox, these antics increased the band's reputation as an energetic live act and helped to increased album sales. Scream, Dracula, Scream! was the last of three releases by Rocket from the Crypt in 1995. The EP The State of Art is on Fire and LP Hot Charity had preceded the album that year, and singer/guitarist John Reis would later refer to these three records as a \"trilogy\". \"Scream, Dracula, Scream!\" also had different copies for Japan and Australia. Both of them had songs from the 'Hot Charity' recording. The Japan release just had the songs put on the CD, but the \"Australian Bonus CD Tour Edition\" had a bonus CD. The Australian copy had \"Pushed\", \"My Arrow's Aim\", \"Lorna Doom\", \"Shucks\", \"Cloud Over Branson\", and \"Feathered Friends\". The Japanese copy also had \"Pushed\", \"My Arrow's Aim\", and \"Lorna Doom\". But instead of \"Shucks\", \"Cloud Over Branson\", and \"Feathered Friends\", they had \"Guilt Free\", \"Poison Eye\", and \"Pity Yr Paws\". All together, the whole 'Hot Charity' recording was released on the two versions."@en ;

The EP is included on the remastered version of The Chronicle of the Black Sword album. The EP was a taster for a proposed full blown Earth Ritual album and tour, that would have involved Robert Calvert and Barney Bubbles, as a follow up to 1972's Space Ritual. However, the project was delayed in favour of The Chronicle of the Black Sword collaboration with Michael Moorcock, then abandoned following Calvert's death in August 1988. The EP is dedicated to Bubbles, who committed suicide just prior to its release. The group's line-up was in flux at the time, with guitarists Dave Brock and Huw Lloyd-Langton and bassist Harvey Bainbridge being the constant. Saxophonist Nik Turner and keyboardist Dead Fred had joined the group, although neither appeared on any of these recordings, they were part of the touring group. Former bassist Lemmy makes a guest appearance on \"Night of the Hawks\". The group had tried a succession of drummers: Andy Anderson had been suitable but left to join The Cure; Lloyd-Langton Group drummer John Clark plays on \"Dragons and Fables\", but Brock felt he was unsuitable for the group; drum technician Robert Heaton plays on \"Green Finned Demon\", but he was committed to his own group New Model Army; and the track \"Night of the Hawk\" uses a drum loop. For the tour, Rick Martinez drummed but he was replaced part way through by Clive Deamer. The group undertook a 35 date UK tour in February and March 1984 to promote the album, with support from Bronz. Various former members, including Lemmy, Moorcock and Dave Anderson, made guest appearances at various shows. The Ipswich Gaumont show on 9 March was filmed and released as Night of the Hawks."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"The Iron Lady is a 1979 British comedy album spoofing the life of Margaret Thatcher (1925\u20132013), the long-serving (1979\u20131990) Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. The album was written by Private Eye writer and satirist John Wells. It was a precursor to his later work lampooning Thatcher in the Dear Bill series of letters that appeared in Private Eye (and in book form) and the 1981 stage farce, Anyone for Denis? The album was produced by John Lloyd whose credits include the comedy television programmes Not the Nine O'Clock News, Spitting Image, Blackadder, and QI - and Martin Lewis the co-creator and producer of the Secret Policeman's Ball series. For Lloyd, like Wells, working on the Thatcher album was a preparation for his future work spoofing Thatcher. In 1984 he created and produced the BAFTA Award-winning satirical puppet show Spitting Image that aired on the ITV network from 1984 to 1996 - in which Margaret Thatcher was the most notable protagonist. The album starred noted Thatcher impressionist Janet Brown, in the role of Margaret Thatcher, with other roles (both male and female) portrayed by John Wells. The album was released in the UK by Logo Records in October 1979, just five months after Thatcher became Prime Minister.[citation needed] Brown promoted the album appearing as Thatcher singing the album's theme song Iron Lady on the BBC TV programme Top of the Pops on 25 October 1979, Brown also made a surprise appearance dressed up as Thatcher at that year's Labour Party Conference in Brighton as a publicity stunt to launch the album and was photographed with surprised politicians Tony Benn and Barbara Castle who both initially believed that Brown was actually their nemesis Thatcher. The album was deleted in the early 1980s and was unavailable until it was reissued digitally in 2013 immediately following Thatcher's death. In interviews in major national newspapers published shortly after Thatcher died, the album's co-producer, Martin Lewis disclosed that the album had not sold well on its initial release, which he attributed to the fact that just four months after her election as Prime Minister, Thatcher was \"still in her honeymoon period\". In the interviews Lewis recounted an encounter he had with Thatcher at a reception in her honor at the home of the British Consul-General in Los Angeles in November 1991 - just one year after her resignation as Prime Minister. On learning that Lewis had produced the infamous album that had satirized her early in her premiership, Thatcher enquired how the album had sold. Lewis informed her that the sales had been poor because of her then high popularity. In response Thatcher quipped \"You should reissue it! I think it'll find a much bigger audience now.\" In April 2013, the album was reissued by Lewis' Springtime! Records label and made available digitally. Two singles of songs from the album were also issued, The Iron Lady (the album's title song) and I'm There! (described as \"an orgasmic dance track\"). A website, Facebook page, and a Twitter feed, were also launched. Asked about the timing of the reissue, Lewis stated: \"After her passing, I thought carefully about all the contributions that Margaret Thatcher had made to Britain and the world during her decades in politics. And I thought that I should honor those contributions by following her advice. So I am reissuing the album. She asked for it, and I certainly think she deserves it.\""@en ;

A \"limited edition\" digipack version of the album was also released, including a DVD of music videos and other footage shot during the album's production. The album reached #9 on the Billboard 200 aided by the single \"The Last DJ\" which hit #22 on Billboard's Mainstream Rock Tracks in 2002. As of 2010, The Last DJ has sold 353,000 copies in the U.S. according to Nielsen SoundScan. In an episode of The Simpsons titled \"How I Spent My Strummer Vacation\", Homer receives song-writing lessons from Tom Petty, and in the original airing the track \"The Last DJ\" can be heard playing over the radio in the final scene. The song was changed for syndication. The song \"Dreamville\" is played at the end of the DVD that was released to commemorate the 2002 Anaheim Angels' World Series win.

The song relates, \"Born into a family of barbers, he, like many of his fellow natives, moved to Calcutta for work\".

It includes all 17 of the group's singles (both A- and B-sides) supplemented with more than a dozen album tracks, their performance for the film Blow-Up, and three early solo numbers by singer Keith Relf. Previous attempts at career compilations were hampered by cross-licensing problems. Yardbirds' recordings from different periods have different owners (corresponding to the tenures of their three main producers), which proved to be an obstacle.

Def Jam, however, refused to change the contract which caused the L.A. Posse to leave. Walking with a Panther was primarily produced by L.L. Cool J and Dwayne Simon, with additional production from Rick Rubin and Public Enemy's production team, The Bomb Squad. Walking with a Panther was a commercial success, peaking at number six on the Billboard 200 and number one on the Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart, where it spent four weeks. The album contained the singles \"Going Back to Cali\", \"I'm That Type of Guy\", \"Jingling Baby\", \"Big Ole Butt\" and \"One Shot at Love\", which also achieved chart success. Walking with a Panther, however, was met with a mixed response from the hip-hop community at the time of its release, who was un-favorable of several of the album's love ballads.

	dbo:abstract	"Love Songs (stylized as Love songs) is the twelfth studio album by Japanese singer-songwriter Ayumi Hamasaki. The album was released on December 22, 2010 through Avex Trax, eight months after her eleventh studio album Rock 'n' Roll Circus. A stylistic return to the aesthetic of her albums before Secret, Love Songs contains pop songs with lyrics primarily revolving around love, many of them ballads. The album was promoted with three singles. These singles were a countdown to her fiftieth single. Lead single \"Moon\"/\"Blossom\" was released on July 14, 2010. Its performance was disappointing: despite it reaching number one, the single sold just over 95,000 copies and failed to be certified. \"Crossroad\" saw similar performance. Though it was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of Japan, it sold just over 99,000 copies. The third single was Hamasaki's fiftieth single, aptly titled \"L\", the Roman numeral for fifty. A triple-A-side consisting of the songs \"Last Angel\", \"Virgin Road\", and \"Sweet Season\", L reached number one on the Oricon charts, becoming her thirty-eighth single to top the charts in Japan. However, it sold under 95,000 copies. The album's release was coincided with the release of Naoya Urata's debut single \"Dream On\", produced by Hamasaki, becoming her first production credit for another artist. The song snippets were made available for streaming on Hamasaki's official website. Love Songs was moderately successful in Japan, where it debuted atop the Oricon with first-week sales of over 180,000 copies. This tallied Hamasaki's lowest first-week sales for an album at that point. Having sold over 270,000 copies, the album has been certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of Japan. The leading radio single, \"Love Song,\" has also been certified as a gold single by the RIAJ, for digital downloads to cellphones."@en ;

General consensus among critics was that despite its shortcomings, the album was an overall solid effort and an improvement over The Outsider. The album was preceded by the single releases \"Def Surrounds Us\" / \"I've Been Trying\" (2010) and \"I Gotta Rokk\" (2011), as well as the EPs I Gotta Rokk and I'm Excited (2011). Contributions to the album came from a wide range of artists including Talib Kweli, Afrikan Boy, Posdnuos, and Tom Vek."@en ;

Vocalist/guitarist Dann Huff had proven his guitar-playing chops as a studio musician on hit albums and singles across the popular music spectrum throughout the 1980s before starting a band with brother David on drums, Mike Brignardello on bass and Alan Pasqua on keyboards and scoring a hit of their own with \"I'll See You In My Dreams\" in 1989-1990. For the follow-up the band was joined in the writing process on two songs by Jim Vallance and on four by Van Stephenson, the latter of whom also guested on background vocals in the studio. Huff had previously done guitar work on Stephenson's solo albums. It was produced by Terry Thomas, a former member of the band Charlie who had previously produced albums for such rock notables as Bad Company and Foreigner. Although well-reviewed, Time to Burn was among the last of its commercial AOR/melodic hard rock genre to be released by a major label \u2014 and not the label of their previous album \u2014 as record companies and media outlets stopped promoting '80s artists in favor of newer grunge styles. The album's most successful single was \"Chained\", which peaked at No. 16 on the Billboard Mainstream Rock Tracks chart, although second single \"Stay\" received some airplay as well."@en ;

For example, \"On the way (To Oklahoma)\" begins with a story, from the animal's viewpoint, about a man obsessed with tigers. On the next page, the lyrics are shown, giving the listener the details behind the story. On this particular track, the man goes insane, thinks he's a tiger, and kills a dog. The story precedes the song itself, but also tells us what happened to the man. However, not all tracks contain stories. \"Dreaming of an Anthill (Teeming)\", \"Ingrid's Oily Tongue\", and \"Mr. Bee's Bumble\" are instrumental tracks.

It is arguably the least similar to other tracks on the album (except for Satan), which for the most part carry folk rock or progressive rock moods. This version of \"Monkey\" also may be the first Gothic Rock track Robert Plant has ever recorded, and although it is not a staple at Plant's live performances, there have been instances where he has performed it.

It is the band's first album following the departure of founding members Boz Scaggs and Jim Peterman, with Ben Sidran replacing Peterman on keyboards. The tracks \"Celebration Song\" and \"My Dark Hour\" featured Paul McCartney (credited as \"Paul Ramon\") on backing vocals, drums and bass guitar. \"My Dark Hour\" was recorded in a late-night session on 9 May 1969 after McCartney had had an acrimonious argument with John Lennon, George Harrison and Ringo Starr over signing a contract appointing Allen Klein as The Beatles' financial manager. Miller was the only member of the band to attend the session, and the song emerged from him and McCartney jamming. The primary guitar riff on \"My Dark Hour\" was also used on the title track to Steve Miller's 1976 album Fly Like an Eagle. \"Space Cowboy\" uses the same primary guitar riff as the Beatles' song \"Lady Madonna,\" owing perhaps to McCartney's involvement on \"My Dark Hour\" and allied permission. It was released as downloadable content for the video game Rock Band on January 20, 2009."@en ;

The album title is the closing line from the 1972 partisan film Valter brani Sarajevo and it refers to the city of Sarajevo. The first track is the theme from the film. The album recording began in November 1983 in studio 17 that was located in record producer Mahmud Pa\u0161a Ferovi\u0107's house. Released by Jugoton, the record was out in limited circulation of 3,000 copies, indicative of the label's modest expectations, however, it started selling surprisingly well, eventually crossing the mark of 100,000 copies sold. It also received plenty of accolades, including making the list of top 100 albums in the history of pop and rock music in Yugoslavia published in the 1998 book YU 100: najbolji albumi jugoslovenske rok i pop muzike.

It is a compilation album chosen from his biggest hits between 1979 and 1986. It was released only in the United States and Canada. The album was released at a time when Elton John had just moved back to his old U.S. label, MCA Records. Geffen's last-ditch compilation was met with some disdain from the artist, who resented the competition against his new live album on MCA, which eventually bought Geffen in 1990. Fully one third of the contents came from the 1983 album Too Low for Zero, the album that had received the strongest critical and commercial response of the era. Elsewhere on the collection, less successful but more recent songs such as \"Wrap Her Up\" and \"Heartache All Over the World\" were chosen over older but modestly more successful songs such as 1978's \"Part Time Love\" and 1981's \"Nobody Wins\". However, it did include two songs from MCA, 1979's \"Mama Can't Buy You Love\" (actually recorded in 1977) and 1980's \"Little Jeannie\". In the U.S., it was certified gold in February 1989, platinum in November 1991 and 2x platinum in October 1995 by the RIAA. In 1992, this album was deleted and replaced with Greatest Hits 1976\u20131986. MCA had taken over Geffen Records, and control of copyrights had shifted such that 1977's Greatest Hits Volume II could no longer be presented as before. Two songs from it, \"Don't Go Breaking My Heart\" and \"Sorry Seems to Be the Hardest Word\", were shifted to the new third volume, which also now included 1984's \"Who Wears These Shoes\". To make room for these additions, the 1986 non-hit \"Heartache All Over The World\" and 1983's album-only track \"Too Low for Zero\" were eliminated."@en ;

The single from the album was \"How We Roll\", which featured at time, R&B newcomer Ashanti on the chorus & outro. The video to the song was made into a cartoon and helped remember Big Pun throughout. Fellow rapper and close friend Fat Joe, who was also the compilation's executive producer, revealed in the liner notes of the album that the title chosen for the compilation was in fact the original title for 2000's Yeeeah Baby.
