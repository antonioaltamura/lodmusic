Essex had played the character of Che in the musical based on Che Guevara, and the song is sung from Che's point-of-view. Produced and arranged by Mike Batt, \"Oh What a Circus\" is a mid-tempo song, comparing the musical's titular character Eva Per\u00F3n's life with a circus, and calling her actions fraudulent. The song is a contrafactum, and shares its tune with the better known \"Don't Cry for Me Argentina\" from the same show. \"Oh What a Circus\" was a commercial success for Essex, who had been dropped by his previous record company due to his declining sales. The song reached number 3 on the UK Singles Chart, and the top-30 in Belgium and Netherlands. In subsequent versions of the musical, \"Oh What a Circus\" was sung by a number of performers, including Mandy Patinkin, Ricky Martin and Scottish rock musician Marti Pellow.

	dbo:abstract	"\"Creeping Death\" is a song by the American thrash metal band Metallica, released as the lead and only commercial single from their second studio album Ride the Lightning (1984) (\"Fade to Black\" and \"For Whom the Bell Tolls\", from the same album, were issued as promotional singles). Written from the perspective of the Angel of Death, it describes the Plague of the Death of the Firstborn (Exodus 12:29). One of Metallica's most frequently performed songs, it has been played live 1,413 times (second only to \"Master of Puppets\", at 1,467), and it has occasionally been used on various tours as the opening song of the band's set. It stands as a classic example of the band's thrash style, albeit slower than the material on their first album, Kill 'Em All. The song's middle section, with its ominous chants of \"Die!\" set to a phrygian mode chord progression, is a fan participation staple during Metallica shows. The single was released through Music for Nations in the UK and France. The b-sides were the cover songs \"Am I Evil?\" (originally by Diamond Head) and \"Blitzkrieg\" (originally by Blitzkrieg). Together these covers were known as Garage Days Revisited, which set the stage for Metallica's next cover album, The $5.98 E.P.: Garage Days Re-Revisited EP. The artwork was done by Alvin Petty. The logo and the song's title were added with a plastic layover to the existing artwork. Kirk Hammett had seen the picture hanging up at Petty's house and remarked that it would be perfect for the single and picture-disk that were about to be finished."@en ;

With advance orders exceeding one million copies in the United Kingdom, \"I Want to Hold Your Hand\" would have gone straight to the top of the British record charts on its day of release (29 November 1963) had it not been blocked by the group's first million seller \"She Loves You\", their previous UK single, which was having a resurgence of popularity following intense media coverage of the group. Taking two weeks to dislodge its predecessor, \"I Want to Hold Your Hand\" stayed at number one for five weeks and remained in the UK top fifty for twenty-one weeks in total. It was also the group's first American number one, entering the Billboard Hot 100 chart on 13 January 1964 at number forty-five and starting the British invasion of the American music industry. By 1 February it held the number-one spot, and stayed there for seven weeks before being replaced by \"She Loves You\", a reverse scenario of what had occurred in Britain. It remained on the US charts for a total of fifteen weeks. \"I Want to Hold Your Hand\" became the Beatles' best-selling single worldwide.

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Papa_Don\u0027t_Preach>	rdf:type	dbo:MusicalWork ;
	dbo:abstract	"\"Papa Don't Preach\" is a song by American singer Madonna from her third studio album True Blue (1986). The song was written by Brian Elliot with additional lyrics by Madonna, and produced by Stephen Bray and Madonna. The song also appears remixed on the 1990 compilation album The Immaculate Collection and in its original form on the 2009 compilation album Celebration. The song's musical style combines pop and classical styling, and its lyrics deal with teenage pregnancy and abortion. It was based on teen gossip Elliot heard outside his studio, which has a large front window that doubles as a mirror where schoolgirls from the North Hollywood High School in Los Angeles regularly stopped to fix their hair and chat. Released as the album's second single in mid-1986, the song was a commercial success. It became Madonna's fourth number-one single on the Billboard Hot 100, and performed well internationally, reaching the top position in the United Kingdom and Australia. It was well received by music critics and was frequently cited as a highlight in the album. The music video, directed by James Foley, shows Madonna's second image makeover, featuring her with a more toned and muscular body, and cropped platinum blonde hair. It portrayed a storyline where Madonna is trying to tell her father about her pregnancy. The images are juxtaposed with shots of Madonna dancing and singing in a small, darkened studio, and spending a romantic evening with her boyfriend. Shortly after its release, the song caused heated discussions about its lyrical content. Women's organizations and others in the family planning field criticized Madonna for encouraging teenage pregnancy, while groups opposed to abortion saw the song as having a positive pro-life message. Madonna has performed \"Papa Don't Preach\" in four of her world tours, most recently The MDNA Tour in 2012. The song also caused her first conflict with the Vatican, as she dedicated it to Pope John Paul II, who urged Italian fans to boycott her concerts during the Who's That Girl World Tour in 1987. In 2002, British singer Kelly Osbourne recorded a hard rock cover of the song which was included as a bonus track on her debut album Shut Up."@en ;

dbr:Space_Oddity	rdf:type	dbo:MusicalWork ;
	dbo:abstract	"\"Space Oddity\" is a song written and performed by David Bowie and released as a 7-inch single on 11 July 1969. It was also the opening track of the album David Bowie. The song is about the launch of Major Tom, a fictional astronaut, and was released during a period of great interest in space flight. The United States' Apollo 11 mission would launch five days later, and would become the first manned moon landing another five days later. The lyrics have also been seen to lampoon the British space programme, which had only launched rockets at that time and has never attempted a moon landing. Besides its title, which alludes to the film 2001: A Space Odyssey, the introduction to the song is a barely audible instrumental build-up that is analogous to the deep bass tone in Also sprach Zarathustra that is prominently used in the film. \"Space Oddity\" was David Bowie's first UK top 5 hit, and was awarded the 1969 Ivor Novello Award, together with Peter Sarstedt's \"Where Do You Go To (My Lovely)?\". It became one of Bowie's signature songs, and his second album, originally released as David Bowie in the UK, was renamed after the track for its 1972 re-release by RCA Records, and became known by this name. In 1975, upon re-release as part of a maxi-single, the song was Bowie's first UK No. 1 single. Bowie would later revisit his Major Tom character in the songs \"Ashes to Ashes\", \"Hallo Spaceboy\" and the music video for \"Blackstar\". German singer Peter Schilling's 1983 hit \"Major Tom (Coming Home)\" is written as a retelling of the song. In 2013, the song gained renewed popularity after it was covered by Canadian astronaut Chris Hadfield, who performed the song while aboard the International Space Station, and therefore became the first music video shot in space. In January 2016, the song gained new popularity following the death of David Bowie, and re-charted in singles charts around the world, reaching a new peak of number 1 on the French Singles Chart and ranking as third on iTunes on January 12, 2016."@en ;

The phrase \"all my rowdy friends\" would later become a catch phrase of sorts for Williams, who would use the line in 1984 for \"All My Rowdy Friends Are Coming Over Tonight,\" in 1987 for \"Born to Boogie\" and \"All My Rowdy Friends Are Here on Monday Night,\" and in 2011 for \"Keep the Change.\" The song itself is told from the point of view of a disillusioned singer who, along with his friends, had lived a wild lifestyle. Although admitting he himself has mellowed with age, the singer is depressed that his one-time \"rowdy\" friends have settled down and, in abandoning their high-living ways, want no part of their old lifestyle. References are made to Williams' contemporaries, such as George Jones, Waylon Jennings, Johnny Cash and Kris Kristofferson."@en ;

The song received positive reviews from music critics, who praised its fresh sound and production.

The term \"Bop Gun\" was invented and popularized by Parliament and George Clinton in the 1977 song \"Bop Gun (Endangered Species)\".

In the ending the music stops with a fadeout and we can finally catch George Clinton holding the Bop Gun.

Written by Mac Powell and produced by Third Day, it was released as the lead single from the band's 2008 album Revelation through Essential Records. \"Call My Name\" has been considered a pop rock and \"AC-friendly\" song with a basic drum track and a \"solid\" melody. Lyrically, it has been alternately described as being set from the perspective of God or being a cry out to God. \"Call My Name\" received positive reception from critics, some of whom praised the arrangement of the song. Third Day has performed the song live and it has been covered by Australian country singer Keith Urban. The song was a hit on Christian radio, peaking atop the Billboard Hot Christian Songs and Hot Christian AC charts and the Radio & Records Christian AC Monitored, Christian AC Indicator and Christian CHR charts. Billboard magazine ranked it second on the 2008 year-end Hot Christian Songs chart and third on the 2008 year-end Hot Christian AC chart and at twenty-seventh on the decade-end Hot Christian Songs chart and at thirty-sixth on the decade-end Hot Christian AC chart."@en ;

While the prior single \"Breathe\" and subsequent single \"Here I Go Impossible Again\" / \"All This Time Still Falling Out of Love\" both offered downloadable software on their limited edition CD singles for creating remixes of the respective songs, \"Don't Say You Love Me\" instead offered a separate website with a Macromedia Flash-based remix applet that allows the user to purchase custom remixes as MP3 downloads.

The single was released in April 1986, and topped the Austrian charts the following month. The song was Bruce and Bongo's only major hit, making the duo a one-hit wonder. It sampled Rock Me Amadeus by Falco. The song is considered a novelty song, with lyrics mostly in English. In German, the word \"Geil\" originally meant \"horny\" but by the 1980s had come to also mean \"cool\" or \"awesome\" in slang. For the older generation this sounded like a provocation, and it was meant to be one of course.[citation needed] The song featured lyrics stating that everyone is cool/horny (\"Everybody's geil, g-g-g-g-geil\"). It also featured a section about the tennis player Boris Becker, claiming that \"Boris is geil\", and imitating a tennis umpire. The music video accompanying the song featured Bruce and Bongo in a gym, with several elderly women doing exercises on various items of gym equipment. The music video is today generally considered to be cheesy and slightly camp, although this was probably done intentionally to give the video a novelty factor matching that of the song. After the release of \"Geil\", Bruce and Bongo would release The Geil Album, although in comparison the album was a commercial failure."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"I'll Be There\" is a soul song written by Berry Gordy, Hal Davis, and Willie Hutch, which resulted in one U.S. #1 hit single: a 1992 live version by American R&B singers Mariah Carey and Trey Lorenz.

Produced by the songwriters, \"I'll Be There\" was The Jackson 5's fourth #1 hit in a row (after \"I Want You Back\"-1970, \"ABC\"-1970, and \"The Love You Save\"-1970), making them the first black male group to achieve four consecutive #1 pop hits. \"I'll Be There\" is also notable as the most successful single released by Motown during its \"Detroit era\" (1959\u201372). The Mariah Carey/Trey Lorenz cover was recorded during Carey's appearance on MTV Unplugged in 1992, and released as the first single from her EP MTV Unplugged in the second quarter of 1992.

	dbo:abstract	"I Like It Like That was a 1964 hit song by Motown group The Miracles on its Tamla label subsidiary. It reached the Top 30 of the Billboard Pop chart, charting at #27 and the Top 10 of Cash Box R&B chart, peaking at #10.(Billboard Magazine's R&B chart was temporarily suspended during this time). This is not the Chris Kenner hit song of the same name, but rather, a Miracles original, written by Miracles members Smokey Robinson and Marv Tarplin, and is included on the group's first greatest hits album, \"Greatest Hits from the Beginning\". It was also the title song from their long-since deleted 1964 album of the same name. Like many Miracles hit songs, \"I Like It Like That\" begins with Tarplin's guitar. It features a \"live party\" feel, similar to their earlier 1963 hit, \"Mickey's Monkey\". Smokey encourages everybody to \"clap your hands now, everybody, we're gonna have some fun tonight...we're gonna sing and shout...knock ourselves out...and everything's gonna be alright\". The other Miracles, Bobby, Ronnie, Pete, and Claudette, join in with their trademark harmony vocals, with chants of alright, and I like it like that as The Funk Brothers add additional instruments to the mix. \"I Like It Like That\" was released during a period (1964) when Smokey and the Miracles were so busy touring as the headline act with the famed Motortown Revue shows, and writing big hits for other Motown acts, principally Mary Wells and The Temptations, that their own chart action suffered. Of the group's four single releases that year (the others were \"Come On Do The Jerk\", \"(You Can't Let the Boy Overpower) The Man in You\", and \"That's What Love Is Made Of\"), \"I Like It Like That\" was the only one to crack the Billboard Pop Top 30, while two songs that they wrote for the two aforementioned acts, \"My Guy\" and \"My Girl\" respectively, both reached #1 Pop. (\"My Girl\" was originally intended to be recorded by The Miracles, had they released it instead, it would have given them a badly needed big hit that year). Fortunately the following year, 1965, would prove to be The Miracles' biggest year ever. \"I Like It Like That\" has inspired cover versions by Bobby Vee and Mitch Ryder & the Detroit Wheels. The song's B side, \"You're So Fine And Sweet\", featured a rare lead by Miracles second tenor Bobby Rogers (who had sung co-lead vocals with Smokey on the group's smash single \"You've Really Got A Hold On Me\" the previous year), and inspired a cover version by The Undertakers."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"I Will Always Love You\" is a song written and originally recorded by American singer-songwriter Dolly Parton. The country track was released on June 6, 1974 as the second single from Parton's thirteenth solo studio album, Jolene (1974). It was written for her one-time partner and mentor Porter Wagoner, as a farewell since they were professionally parting career paths as Dolly Parton had chosen to pursue a solo career. Parton's version of \"I Will Always Love You\" attained commercial success, twice reaching number one on the Billboard Hot Country Songs chart. First, in June 1974 and again in 1982 when her rerecording of the song also reached number one October of that year. With that accomplishment, Parton became the first artist ever to earn a number one record twice with the same song. The song also won Parton Female Vocalist at the CMA Awards, in 1975. Whitney Houston recorded a cover version of the song for the 1992 film The Bodyguard. Her single spent 14 weeks at number one on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. It has since become one of the best-selling singles of all time. Houston's version of \"I Will Always Love You\" re-charted in 2012 after her death, making it only the second single ever to reach the top three on the Billboard Hot 100 in separate chart runs. The song was covered by many artists like Linda Ronstadt and Jon Doe."@en ;

It was released on September 18, 2011 under label Polydor Records as the second single from Roberts debut album Cinderella's Eyes. The song was written by Roberts and was produced by Canadian electropop group Dragonette. \"Lucky Day\" is an upbeat pop song featuring synths; lyrically the song talks of a boy not succumbing to advances\u2014but doing so eventually\u2014although Roberts stated the concept relates to all aspects of life and luckiness. Roberts' vocals have been compared to that of Liza Minnelli and the track has been compared to the music of David Guetta and the Katy Perry track \"Last Friday Night (T.G.I.F.)\". The song was well received by contemporary critics, who noted the success of the Dragonette-production, in addition to reviewers who called it a good follow-up single to her debut due to the successful pop themes and potential of the track. Commercially the track debuted at number 40 in both the UK Singles Chart and the Scottish Singles Chart. A music video directed by Stephen Agnes was released; the video was filmed in the East Village of New York City and presented Roberts walking down various streets in the city with special effects added to her movements. During the shoot, weather conditions made it uncomfortable for filming, although this was not reflected in critical opinion. The video's simplicity, as well as the dress she wore in the video, gained mixed responses from critics."@en ;

The song became The Rolling Stones' third number one hit single in the US and sixth in the UK.

Called \"chilly goth-rock\" and \"accessible...synth-pop\", the song has a single version which is a shorter edit of the album version. There are also two different remixes on two UK 12\" singles, and other singles released around the world, one of which later appeared on Mixed Up as the Extended Dub Mix and differs significantly from the album version in arrangement in that incorporates wholly original drum and bass arrangements. The other is an extended remix of the original album version which, at 7:59, runs slightly longer than the album version. There is also an edit which was released on 12\" in the US, titled \"extended remix\" as in the European and Australasian releases, but which runs for 6:40 rather than 7:59. According to interviews, the inspiration of the song came when a fire broke loose in Robert Smith's home. After that day, Smith was going through the remains and came across his wallet which had pictures of his wife, Mary. The cover of the single is one of the pictures. The same picture was used as the cover of the \"Charlotte Sometimes\" single, but that version was heavily warped and distorted. In 2011, the song was voted #283 on Rolling Stone's \"The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time\" list."@en ;

But unlike many songs from Infest and their next single Time And Time Again, the song begins just with Jacoby Shaddix singing and then goes to the chorus, Jacoby raps in the bridge of the song.

It was written and produced by Jackson, Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis, with additional lyrics by Simon. The R&B and hip hop song is built around a sample of 1972's \"You're So Vain\" by Simon, who also added some new spoken parts into the song; it talks about an unidentified man who attempted to extort money from Jackson. An official remix featuring Missy Elliott was released as the third single from the album on December 11, 2001 by Virgin Records. The album version of \"Son of a Gun (I Betcha Think This Song Is About You)\" received mixed reviews from music critics, with some calling it a highlight from the album, while others criticized Simon's rapping. The remix version also received a mixed reaction from reviewers. The song reached number 28 on the US Billboard Hot 100, becoming Jackson's lowest-charting single since 1983, and also reached low positions worldwide. Its accompanying music video directed by Francis Lawrence depicts Jackson stalking a man in a hotel. \"Son of a Gun (I Betcha Think This Song Is About You)\" was performed on the 2001\u201302 All for You Tour."@en ;

It was filmed in Las Vegas around the time Tupac Shakur was murdered and featured a cameo appearance by Frank Vincent. Perhaps as a show of appreciation, Scorsese later used Nas' \"Thief's Theme\" in a scene from his 2006 gangster/cop drama The Departed.

Produced by the duo themselves and Roy Halee, it was released as the lead single from the album on March 21, 1969. The song, written by Paul Simon, is a folk rock ballad that variously takes the form of a first-person lament as well as a third-person sketch of a boxer. Simon's lyrics are largely autobiographical and partially inspired by the Bible, and were written during a time when he felt he was being unfairly criticized. The song's lyrics discuss poverty and loneliness. It is particularly known for its plaintive refrain, in which the singer sings 'lie-la-lie', accompanied by a heavily reverbed drum. \"The Boxer\" was the follow-up to one of the duo's most successful singles, \"Mrs. Robinson\". It peaked at No. 7 on the Billboard Hot 100. It performed well internationally, charting within the Top 10 in nine countries, peaking highest in the Netherlands, South Africa, and Sweden.

The production begins with a simple heavy rock electric blues guitar riff, carried through each verse and chorus, while the \"Land of hope and gloria\" bridge and raucous background vocals from Dave Davies build to an exultant climax of brass, played by a group not generally known for being anywhere near that patriotic."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"Beautiful Day\" is a song by the Irish rock band U2. It is the first track from their 2000 album, All That You Can't Leave Behind, and it was released as the album's lead single. It was a commercial success, helping launch the album to multi-platinum status, and is U2's biggest hit to date. Like many tracks from All That You Can't Leave Behind, \"Beautiful Day\" harkens back to the group's past sound. The tone of the Edge's guitar was a subject of debate amongst the band members, as they disagreed on whether he should use a sound similar to that from their early career in the 1980s. Lead singer Bono explained that the upbeat track is about losing everything but still finding joy in what one has. The song received positive reviews, and it became their fourth number-one single in the UK and their first number-one in the Netherlands. The song peaked at number 21 in the United States, the band's highest position since \"Discoth\u00E8que\" in 1997. In 2001, the song won three Grammy Awards for Song of the Year, Record of the Year, and Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal. The group has played \"Beautiful Day\" at every one of their concerts since the song's 2001 live debut on the Elevation Tour."@en ;

The song was released by Mute Records as the second single from Erasure's third studio album The Innocents. In the United States, Sire Records released it as the first single. The album version was produced by Stephen Hague and was slightly remixed for its single release (most notably the album version starts cold, while the radio version contains a short synthesizer pattern as an intro). \"Chains of Love\" became Erasure's sixth consecutive Top 20 hit on the UK singles chart, just missing the Top 10 by peaking at number eleven. In the United States, it became Erasure's mainstream breakthrough by climbing to number twelve on the Billboard Hot 100 and becoming the group's first entry on the Modern Rock Tracks chart. It also hit number four on the U.S. Hot Dance Music/Club Play chart. \"Chains of Love\" remains as Erasure's highest-charting U.S. pop hit. The song, written by Vince Clarke and Andy Bell, is an uptempo dance-oriented synthpop track with Clarke's signature analogue sound and Bell's lyrics about breaking through any restrictions or stereotypes of what love should be. The lyrics allude subtly to Bell's desire for wider acceptance of homosexual couples, his pain evident from the opening lines \"How can I explain when there are few words I can choose/How can I explain when words get broken\". The chorus is memorable for Bell's use of falsetto. The music video featured Clarke and Bell performing the song while being hoisted through the air by thick, metal chains."@en ;

Addressing themes of urban decay, deindustrialisation, unemployment and violence in inner cities, the song is remembered for being a hit at the same time as riots were occurring in British cities. Internal tensions within the band were also coming to a head when the single was being recorded, resulting in the song being the last single recorded by the original seven members of the group before splitting up. However, the song was hailed by the contemporary UK music press as a major piece of popular social commentary, and all three of the major UK music magazines of the time awarded \"Ghost Town\" the accolade of \"Single of the Year\" for 1981."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"Hush Hush; Hush Hush\" is a song by American female group The Pussycat Dolls from their final and second studio album, Doll Domination (2008). Written by Nicole Scherzinger, Andreas Romdhane, Josef Larossi, Ina Wroldsen, Dino Fekaris, Frederik Perren and produced by Quiz & LaRossi and Dave Aud\u00E9 for the remixed version, it was released as the album's sixth and final single on May 12, 2009. Lead and background vocals for both versions of the song are performed solely by lead singer Nicole Scherzinger. The release caused controversy as the single was credited as \"Pussycat Dolls featuring Nicole Scherzinger\" which caused tension within the group and rumored that Scherzinger would be going solo. The song was originally a slow ballad, but was remade into an uptempo, disco-inspired dance song sampling parts of Gloria Gaynor's 1978 hit \"I Will Survive\". Lyrically, the song is about a strong woman who laments of the death of her relationship and never asks help from her lover. The \"post-breakup anthem\", received mixed reviews by critics who noted that it lacked the R&B edge of \"Don't Cha\" and \"When I Grow Up\" while others noted it's better than the original version. Commercially the song has had moderate success managing to peak top-ten in Australia, Belgium (Wallonia), Finland and France. In The United States it charted at seventy-three on the Billboard Hot 100, and topped the Hot Dance Club Songs chart. An accompanying music video for the song, directed by Ray Kay, premiered on May 27, 2009. The video was met with mixed reviews, criticizing the over-emphasis on Scherzinger but noted for being \"the most revealing Pussycat Dolls video yet\"."@en ;

There was no music video made for this single. \"In a Dream\" peaked at number 72 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1998. \"In a Dream\" is a song written and produced by Randy Taylor-Weber of Galaxy Freestyle Records. The song was first created in San Leandro, CA in 1989 at an upstairs studio with a three girl group by the name of First Kiss. It was a house recording made just for the pure enjoyment of entertainment. In 1994, with advanced recording equipment, Randy Taylor-Weber then re-created a three girl group and called them \"Emotion in Motion\". There were various ladies in the group, but on a demo tape that Randy made and promoted to the public, Maria, Claudia and Bernadette's version was the one that stood out. However the group departed and in 1996, Randy re-created the song once more with extensive advanced studio equipment and came across a new singer by the name of Jossette from Redwood City, CA. In 1996, Jossette at the time was working at a Macy's department store, when one of the Galaxy Freestyle Records employees approached her and asked if she can sing. Oddly enough she said yes and this led to an audition with Randy Taylor-Weber. They met up and recorded the smash hit song \"In a Dream\". This version got its break on Wild 94.9 (back then Wild 107.7 of San Francisco), DJ Jose Melendez decided to give the record a chance on radio. Within minutes the phone lines blew up and Jossette was asked to come back and be on Jojo Wright's Make It or Break It segment (JoJo is now at KIIS FM Los Angeles). Shortly after, \"In a Dream\" had its Make It or Break It debut with an astounding 95% saying 'make it'. From there, the song became the longest running # 1 song at the time on the daily countdown (17 weeks long until No Doubt's \"Don't Speak\" took over the top spot). Several radio stations across the country, mainly on the west coast added \"In a Dream\" to its Weekly Chart. The song became a staple in the dance freestyle music industry.In 1997, Robbins Entertainment's artist Rockell, covered the song \"In a Dream\" and it became an instant smash in markets where Galaxy Freestyle Records hadn't been able to reach (due to not having major record budgets). Rockell stays active in performing around the United States. Randy Taylor-Weber jump started another record label \"Galaxy Inc.Records\" and released two songs that entered the top 200 on Mediabase in 2013 entitled \"Take me back to Vegas\" and \"In the Club\"."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"It Doesn't Matter\" is the first single released from Wyclef Jean's second studio album, The Ecleftic: 2 Sides II a Book. The track features additional vocals by Melky Sedeck and wrestler The Rock, whose famous catchphrase inspired the song title. The track also included a sample of \"This Is Ska\" by Bad Manners and \"Mona Lisa\" by Slick Rick. Upon its release in August 2000, it entered the UK Singles Chart at #3, its highest chart position, and went on to spend eight weeks on the charts. In the second verse, the line \"Leave that crack alone\" parodies Pink Floyd's 1979 song \"Another Brick In The Wall (Part 2)\", which contained the line \"Hey, teacher! Leave those kids alone.\" The song was also released in French, under the title \"\u00C7a ne me fait rien\" for Quebec and French radio stations, with Jacky and Ben-J providing additional vocals. Some lines were changed for that version. e.g. \"I got 50 Bentleys in the West Indies\" was replaced by \"J'ai 50 Bentley aux \u00C9tats-Unis\", to fit the rhyming scheme."@en .

	dbo:abstract	"\"Look Back in Anger\" is a song written by David Bowie and Brian Eno for the album Lodger (1979). It concerns \"a tatty 'Angel of Death'\", and features a guitar solo by Carlos Alomar. RCA Records was unsure if America was ready for the sexual androgyny of \"Boys Keep Swinging\", the lead-off single from Lodger in most territories, and \"Look Back in Anger\" was issued instead. The B-side was another track from Lodger called \"Repetition\", a story of domestic violence. The single failed to chart. \"Look Back in Anger\" has a mixed reputation among Bowie commentators. NME critics Roy Carr and Charles Shaar Murray have described it as \"probably the low point\" of the album, while Nicholas Pegg considers it \"one of Lodger's dramatic highlights\". Beyond the shared title, the song has nothing to do with the John Osborne play Look Back in Anger. Bowie performed the song on his 1983 \"Serious Moonlight\" Tour (it is the opening number on the Serious Moonlight film) and reworked it in the mid-90s as a heavy rock song for the \"Outside\" and \"Earthling\" tours."@en ;

Following the breakthrough of the title track's success, the song, written solely by Gaye, became one of the most poignant anthems of sorrow regarding the environment. Led by Gaye playing piano, strings conducted by Paul Riser & David Van de Pitte, multi-tracking vocals from Gaye & The Andantes, multiple background instruments provided by The Funk Brothers and a leading sax solo by Wild Bill Moore, the song rose to #4 on Billboard's Pop Singles chart and #1 for two weeks on the R&B singles charts on August 14 through to August 27, 1971. The song also brought Gaye one of his rare appearances on the Adult Contemporary chart, where it peaked at #34. In 1991, a music video of the song was released by Motown Records featuring appearances by celebrities such as Smokey Robinson, Johnny Gill, Big Daddy Kane, Holly Robinson Peete, Ralph Tresvant, Bobby Brown, Rosie Perez, Bell Biv Devoe, Wesley Snipes, Malcolm Jamal Warner, Diana Ross, Stevie Wonder, David Bowie and Vanessa L. Williams. As the single became his second million seller from What's Going On, the album started on the soul album charts in the top five and began charging up the pop rankings. \"Mercy Mercy Me (The Ecology)\" soon became one of Gaye's most famous songs in his extensive catalogue. In 2002 it was his third single recording to win a \"Grammy Hall of Fame\" Award. Like \"Inner City Blues\", Bob Babbitt, not James Jamerson, plays the bass line. Also in 1991, Robert Palmer combined the song in a medley with Gaye's 1976 hit \"I Want You\".

As he spends time training for a big fight, he struggles to stay close to his girlfriend while raising their child together. Though Levine appears determined, his girlfriend seems troubled by his bloody profession and financial stability for their daughter and leaves him in the end.

	dbo:abstract	"\"Paper Planes\" is a song by British rapper M.I.A. from her second studio album, Kala (2007). The song was written by M.I.A. and Diplo. The song's backing track is a sample of the 1982 song \"Straight to Hell\" by The Clash, and the members of The Clash are credited as co-writers of the song. The chorus of \"Paper Planes\" was widely speculated to be based on the chorus to the 1992 song \"Rump Shaker\" by Wreckx-N-Effect, although that song's writers are not credited. It was produced by Diplo with additional production by Switch. \"Paper Planes\" was released for download in August 2007 and as the album's third single by XL Recordings and Interscope Records on 11 February 2008. \"Paper Planes\" is a downtempo rap ballad, with a folk style melody considered less dance-influenced than the other songs on the album. The song ignited wide acclaim upon release, and contemporary critics complimented its music direction and the subversive, unconventional subject matter of the piece, citing its chorus and its lyrical humour in the promotion of globalization.[citation needed] Rolling Stone, Rockdelux, Stylus, NME and The Guardian ranked \"Paper Planes\" highly in their lists of the best songs of the year, the 2000s decade and in some cases of all-time[citation needed]. The song won the Indie Award for Favourite International Single at the 2009 Canadian Independent Music Awards and the American Society of Composers, Authors, and Publishers (ASCAP) recognized the song as one of the most performed ones of 2008 at the ASCAP Pop Music Awards. Several artists have covered the song and released their own remixes. The song peaked in the Top 20 in Belgium, Denmark, Canada, the United Kingdom and the United States. M.I.A.'s first Top 20 single in the UK and her next Top 10 charting song in Canada following \"Boyz\" (2007), it reached the Top 10 of seven Billboard charts and peaked at number four on the Billboard Hot 100 in the US. The single reached two positions higher than \"Boyz\" to top the Billboard Hot Dance Singles Sales chart. The song became XL Recordings' best selling single, is certified triple-platinum by the Music Canada (CRIA) in Canada and the Recording Industry Association of America in the US, where it is ranked the fifty-ninth most downloaded song in the digital era, and is certified Gold by the Recording Industry Association of New Zealand in New Zealand. The song has sold 4 million copies in the US. The song was nominated for the Record of the Year for the 51st Grammy Awards in 2009. \"Paper Planes\" was sampled in rappers T.I. and Jay-Z's single \"Swagga Like Us\". The single's accompanying music video, filmed in New York City, showed M.I.A. walking and dancing with friends along the streets of the city, selling sandwiches to local people and paper planes flying overhead. The song has regularly featured on M.I.A.'s concert tours since 2007."@en ;

Contemporary critics were generally positive with \"Still in Love with You\" who declared it brisk and dreamy. In 2003, the track was awarded the NRJ Music Award in the Best German Song category. The single proved to be commercially successful upon its release, charting at number two in Germany, continuing the band's string of top ten hits. \"Still in Love with You\" also reached number four in Austria and number ten on the Swiss Singles Chart while it also entered the top forty of the airplay charts in Hungary.

Travis Tritt also covered the song for the 1993 Eagles' tribute album Common Thread: The Songs of the Eagles; the video for Tritt's version is notable for the appearance of all five members of the Eagles together the first time in 13 years after their break-up, and it led to the reunion of the band a few months later."@en ;

dbr:The_Bitch_Is_Back	rdf:type	dbo:MusicalWork ;
	dbo:abstract	"\"The Bitch Is Back\" is a rock song by Elton John, written with Bernie Taupin. It was the second single released from his 1974 album Caribou, and reached number 1 in Canada (his sixth in that country), number 4 in the United States and number 15 in the United Kingdom. The song has been identified as one of Elton John's best hard rock cuts. In the U.S., it was certified Gold on 13 September 1995 by the RIAA. The idea to create the song was inspired not by John or Taupin directly, but rather by Bernie Taupin's wife of the time. Taupin then wrote the lyrics. Musically, the song originally was written in A-flat major, but is today performed live a half step lower in the key of G major. The saxophone solo in the middle is nowadays usually performed by synthesizers, while a guitar solo occasionally substitutes, as can be seen in the concert videos, One Night Only and Live in Australia. This song was banned on several radio stations, in the United States and elsewhere, due to the use of the word \"bitch\". For example, in 1976, the program director of WPIX-FM in New York told Billboard, \"We will play records that are borderline suggestive records such as 'Disco Lady' by Johnny [sic] Taylor but we will not play 'The Bitch Is Back' by Elton John. We won't play those types of records no matter how popular they get.\" Producer Gus Dudgeon added a live version of it, recorded on Thanksgiving night 1974 at Madison Square Garden, at the close of the There disc on the reissued two-CD version of Here and There. It is a concert staple for John, who loves to play the song live to this day, often as his opening number. A mixed media presentation of it, with a video cameo from Pamela Anderson, was created for part of John's very successful Red Piano show in Las Vegas. The song was twice recorded by Tina Turner: once for her Rough album in 1978, and again for the John/Taupin tribute album Two Rooms in 1991. Turner also performed the song in her live show in the late 1970s, and with Elton John at the VH1 Fashion and Music Awards 1995 and VH1 Divas Live '99. Dusty Springfield is one of the backing vocalists on the studio version of the song. Lita Ford covered \"The Bitch is Back\" on her albums, Living Like a Runaway and the live album, The Bitch Is Back ... Live. Lita named the live album after his song. In 2013, the song was covered in the Glee episode \"Feud\", mashed-up with Madonna's \"Dress You Up\"."@en ;

As a result, he would often do crazy and odd things, such as drive around aimlessly for hours, determined to hear a specific song on the radio.[citation needed] The song's music video revolves around imagery seen in the items of a cubicle. The images become real, life size landscapes that vocalist Pete Loeffler is seen drifting through.

	dbo:abstract	"\"19\" is a song by British musician Paul Hardcastle released as the first single from his self-titled third studio album Paul Hardcastle (1985). The song has a strong anti-war message, focusing on America's involvement in the Vietnam War and the effect it had on the soldiers who served. The track was notable for early use of sampled and processed speech, in particular a synthesized stutter effect used on the words 'nineteen' and 'destruction'. It also includes various non-speech, re-dubbed sampling, such as crowd noise and a military bugle call. \"19\" features sampled narration (voiced by Peter Thomas), out-of-context interview dialogue (\"I wasn't really sure what was going on\") and news reports from Vietnam Requiem the ABC television documentary about the post-traumatic stress disorder suffered by Vietnam veterans. In 2009, the song placed at 73 on VH1's 100 Greatest One-Hit Wonders of the 80s. \"19\" had huge international success in the charts; it went to No. 1 in the UK (for five weeks), a number of other countries worldwide, and yet only met with muted reception in the US Pop Charts. Despite this, the single had great success in the Dance and Club charts, where it went to number 1. \"19\" became the top-selling single in 13 countries. This was helped by the fact that versions of the song, spoken by well-known local news anchors, were recorded in French, Spanish, German and Japanese. The song received the Ivor Novello award for Best-selling single of 1985. The song's English-language release came in three different 12\" versions - \"Extended Version\", \"Destruction Mix\" and \"The Final Story\", each with an alternative cover design."@en ;

The song was promoted with a music video, directed by Yoann Lemoine (a.k.a.

At the 2012 UK Music Video Awards, \"Born to Die\" won the \"Best Pop - International Video\" award, outranking her other songs \"Blue Jeans\" and \"National Anthem\" which were also nominees. Critical reception for the video was generally positive. The video has received over 220 million views on video-sharing website YouTube."@en ;

In a 2014 docu-concert based on Michael's performance at the Opera Garnier during his Symphonica tour, Michael revealed the song was about a short lived bisexual three way relationship he was in, wherein the woman had fallen in love with him and he had fallen in love with the man.[citation needed]"@en ;

The electropop and R&B ballad was written by band members Keisha Buchanan, Mutya Buena and Heidi Range, with Jony Rockstar, Karen Poole and Jeremy Shaw. The producer, Rockstar, developed the idea of a close person as its inspiration. Buena wrote a verse about her daughter, while Buchanan wrote a verse based on her close friend. The song was released as the album's fourth single on 5 June 2006 and contains vocals from Amelle Berrabah in replacement of Buena's, who left the band in December 2005. \"Follow Me Home\" received mixed reviews from critics. Although its instrumentation and the group's vocals were praised, the song was criticised as tedious and uninspiring. The single reached the top forty in Ireland and the United Kingdom, and also charted in Romania, Slovakia, and on the European Hot 100 singles chart. The music video for \"Follow Me Home\" was directed by Tony Tremlett and filmed in Prague, the Czech Republic. It features the Sugababes in a winter environment and contains various scenes of the group in a large house.

It was directed by Colin Tilley. Guetta said how the video focuses more on futuristic images rather than on a plot as some of Guetta's other videos played out. It first opens up with Guetta walking into a room, and Brown appears in a mask as his eyes light up. As Brown starts singing in another scene, he is in a light-up suit. As the chorus plays, Brown is seen in a zero-gravity room. Guetta also then seen in the zero-gravity room. Wayne then is seen with a skateboard with a few other skateboarders in the background. Wayne is also located in another futuristic room. Brown is then seen in another room with a lit-up floor as he dances while he sings the chorus. Five other dancers join Brown."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"It Girl\" is a song by American recording artist Jason Derulo, released as the second single from his second studio album, Future History on August 9, 2011. The song was written by Derulo, E. Kidd Bogart, Lindy Robbins and Emanuel \"Eman\" Kiriakou, who also handled the song's production. Musically, \"It Girl\" is a mid-tempo pop and R&B love song, that features a whistling intro and an acoustic guitar melody. Lyrically, it revolves around Derulo singing the praises of the perfect girl he found after searching all over. The lyrics reference the title in the opening chorus phrase, \"You could be my it girl\". The song received positive reviews from music critics, who praised its catchy production and radio-friendly lyrics. They also added that it has the potential to overshadow the commercial success of Derulo's debut single, \"Whatcha Say\" (2009). \"It Girl\" attained worldwide success, reaching the top-ten on the singles charts in Australia, Denmark, Ireland, New Zealand and the United Kingdom, and the top-twenty in Hungary, Japan, the Netherlands and Norway. The song peaked at number 17 on the US Billboard Hot 100, number six on the US Hot Dance Club Songs chart, and at number 10 on the US Pop Songs chart. The accompanying music video of \"It Girl\" was directed by Colin Tilley and filmed at a mansion in Malibu, California. It portrays a fictional relationship between Derulo and his love interest played by actress Tika Sumpter. To promote the song, Derulo performed the song live on televised shows, including America's Got Talent, The Wendy Williams Show, The Ellen DeGeneres Show and The X Factor Australia. The official remix of the song premiered online in February 2012, and features Derulo's former girlfriend Jordin Sparks."@en ;

Additionally, Columbia Records sent it to contemporary hit radio playlists on 22 May 2012 as their second single in the United States. Written by Savan Kotecha and its producers, Carl Falk and Rami Yacoub, initially, the upbeat pop rock number was written as two different songs. As both tracks had elusive attributes, the trio decided to merge the two into one song. The lyrical content regards the protagonist's infatuation with a significant other. \"One Thing\" garnered mostly positive reviews from music critics, who generally commended the track's catchiness. The single reached the top ten in Australia, Ireland and the United Kingdom, while attaining top-forty positions in Belgium (Flanders), Canada, New Zealand, and the United States. The number has been certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for shipments of one million copies. Directed by Declan Whitebloom, the accompanying music video depicts One Direction performing in and around London. The group performed \"One Thing\" on televised programmes and four major concert tours: Up All Night Tour (2011\u201312), Take Me Home Tour (2013), Where We Are Tour (2014) and On the Road Again Tour (2015).

Taken from her sixth studio album Two Eleven (2012), it was written and produced by Sean Garrett, Shondrae \"Bangladesh\" Crawford and Dwayne \"Dem Jointz\" Abernathy along with Brown, telling the story of Norwood complimenting a prospective beau on his swag. The bass-heavy, R&B up-tempo track served as Norwood's first release under RCA records, since signing to Chameleon Records under the label, and was released to US digital outlets on May 4, 2012. Upon release, \"Put It Down\" was met by a warm response from critics, who criticized Brown's involvement on the song but generally praised the progressive production and suggestive lyrics. It reached the top forty of the Belgian Ultratop 50 chart as well as the South Korean Gaon Chart and the top-five of the US Billboard Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart, marking Norwood\u2019s tenth top ten entry and first since \u201CWhat About Us?\u201D in 2002.

Filmed in Los Angeles, California and directed by Hype Williams, the clip was creatively moulded by Frank Gatson Jr., and choreographed by Jaquel Knight. The video received general acclaim from critics, who commended the simplicity of the video, while many labeled it as her most fun visual in years.

Spivery, as well as Timbaland prot\u00E9g\u00E9s The Royal Court and Jim Beanz, who produced the track. The song serves as the sixth single from her debut studio album, In a Perfect World.... Giving off a psychedelic vibe and compared to 1980's Prince ballads and Ciara slow burners, the song received generally positive reviews, complimenting its musical backdrop and vulnerable lyrical appeal. Hilson originally premiered the song at her producer/mentor Polow da Don's launch party for his record label, Zone 4, in Atlanta in July 2007, and later performed it several times as promoting it as In A Perfect World's sixth single. The song was not adequately receptive in the United States, reaching forty-nine on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart. Two music videos for the song were shot, the Chris Robinson-directed second version being used as the official video. The video features Hilson at getting ready and enjoying herself at a party, featuring appearances by Monica, Chris Brown, former Pussycat Dolls member Melody Thornton and Omarion, among others. She performed the song as a part of a medley at the 2009 Soul Train Music Awards."@en ;

dbr:We_Belong_Together	rdf:type	dbo:MusicalWork ;
	dbo:abstract	"\"We Belong Together\" is a song by American singer Mariah Carey from her tenth studio album, The Emancipation of Mimi (2005). The song was released on March 29, 2005, through Island Records as the second single from the album. \"We Belong Together\" was written by Carey, Jermaine Dupri, Manuel Seal, and Johnt\u00E1 Austin, and produced by the former three. As the song samples lyrics from Bobby Womack's \"If You Think You're Lonely Now\" (1981) and The Deele's \"Two Occasions\" (1987), several other songwriters are credited. \"We Belong Together\" is built on a simple piano arrangement with an understated backbeat. The lyrics chronicle a woman's desperation for her former lover to return. Following her decline in popularity between 2001 and 2005, critics dubbed the song her musical comeback, as many had considered her career was over. \"We Belong Together\" earned her several music industry awards and nominations throughout 2005\u201306. The song broke chart records in the United States and became Carey's sixteenth topper on the US Billboard Hot 100. After staying at number one for fourteen non-consecutive weeks, it was placed as the second longest running number one song in US chart history, behind Carey's own \"One Sweet Day,\" collaboration with Boyz II Men (1995). Billboard listed it as the \"song of the decade\" and the ninth most popular song of all time. Additionally, it broke several airplay records, gathering both the largest one-day and one-week audiences in history. \"We Belong Together\" also topped the charts in Australia and reached the top two in Canada, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom. The song's music video was filmed as a two-part story with \"It's Like That\", which featured Carey at her bachelorette party. The video for \"We Belong Together\" is a continuation focusing on Carey's wedding to an older and powerful man and ends with the singer eloping with her ex-lover. Rumors arose of the video's connection to her 1993 marriage to Tommy Mottola. Carey performed the song on several award shows and television appearances around the world, namely 2005 MTV Movie Awards, MTV Video Music Awards, Macy's Fourth of July Parade, The Oprah Winfrey Show and the 48th Grammy Awards. In Europe the song was performed at the Live 8 charity concert, the Fashion Rocks in Monaco, and the German Bambi Awards. Carey performed the song on both her Adventures of Mimi and Angels Advocate Tours."@en ;

In an interview conducted by Jan-Erik Kjeseth, he also revealed that in fact he worked with his partner Wally Gold in order to improve a song submitted by another writer, and the end result was \"It's My Party\", a big hit for Lesley Gore. Schroeder and Gold tossed a coin as to whose name should go on the record, and Gold \"won\". Other titles written by the duo include \"It's Now or Never\" and \"Good Luck Charm\"; both of which - like \"A Big Hunk o' Love\" - were originally recorded by American rock and roll icon Elvis Presley. \"A Big Hunk o'Love\" was released as a single on June 23, 1959 by RCA Victor and later topped the Billboard Hot 100 for two weeks. The song was revived by Presley in 1972 during his engagements at the Las Vegas Hilton in February 1972 and was used in his live shows until mid-1973.

The song was written by Layng Martine, Jr. and was later covered by Status Quo and Cliffhanger. Elvis recorded the song at his home studio in Graceland in late October, 1976. Released as a single (with \"Pledging My Love\" on the B-side) on June 6, 1977, it was his single at the time of his death. It initially peaked at No. 31 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart dated August 6, 1977 and had fallen to No. 53 on the chart for the week ending August 27, 1977. Thereafter, it reversed direction and reached an even higher peak at No. 18 on 24 September \u2013 1 October 1977. \"Way Down\" reached No. 1 on the American Country chart the week he died. Overseas, the song hit the UK Singles Chart a few weeks later, almost seven years after his previous UK number-one single, \"The Wonder of You\", in 1970. His previous single, \"Moody Blue\", had been a number-one hit on the US Country Charts earlier in 1977. \"Way Down\" was reissued in April 2005 and reached No. 2 on the UK Singles Chart. The recording also featured J.D. Sumner singing the words \"way on down\" at the end of each chorus, repeating the phrase at the end of the song while hitting a double low C note (three octaves below middle C). According to the Guinness Book of World Records it is the lowest recorded note ever produced by the human voice, first accomplished by Sumner in a 1966 recording of the hymn \"Blessed Assurance.\""@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"Bucky Done Gun\" is the third single from musician M.I.A.'s album Arular. Written by Maya \"M.I.A.\" Arulpragasam, Carol Conners, Bill Conti, Wesley \"Diplo\" Pentz, Ayn Robbins and Deize Tigrona, the song was composed in London in 2004 as one of the last compositions for the singer-rapper's debut album. It was released by XL Recordings in the UK, Interscope Records in the US and Remote Control Records in Australia on 11 July 2005 in 12-inch vinyl and CD single formats. The B-side of the release is the song \"Pull Up the People\" from Arular. Upon release, the song reached number 88 on the UK Singles Chart. \"Bucky Done Gun\" is an uptempo baile funk-dancehall song, combining elements of electro, grime, hip hop and pop music. The song is inspired from Tigrona's funk carioca song \"Inje\u00E7\u00E3o\" from where a drum loop is included and flipped and airhorns are sampled but recomposed from the song \"Gonna Fly Now\" composed by Conti, Conners and Robbins. The song is produced by Diplo with additional production by Dave \"A. Brucker\" Taylor, P. Byrne and Wizard. The song's title word \"Bucky\" is a reference to the London grime slang word for a gun, while the composition is lyrically influenced by her experiences of civil war in Sri Lanka and how the songwriter viewed the journey of rap music. The song was a critical success, with many contemporary critics complimenting the tough yet raw themes of revolution and sexuality in the song's music direction and lyrics. The song's accompanying music video directed by Anthony Mandler was filmed on a desert in Nevada, US. M.I.A. intended for the video to be shot in the favelas in Brazil, but could not shift filming there due to time and budget constraints. The video portrays the singer performing live in an underground nightclub and a desolate wasteland, mixed with scenes of teenagers throwing grenades of smoking colour at buildings. M.I.A and her live backup singer Cherry Byron-Withers provocatively grind against a chain-linked fence and giggling children play in dirty streets and damp landscapes amidst flags of her single artwork. The release of the song and the video's rotation on MTV Brasil marked the first time that a funk carioca-inspired song was played on mainstream radio and music television in Brazil, the genre's country of origin, and contributed towards her rise in popularity there. M.I.A. performed the song on 3 May 2005 on Jimmy Kimmel Live! and performs the song on her concert tours, first on the Arular Tour and most recently on the // / Y / Tour where it was well appreciated by fans. M.I.A.'s performance of the song and \"Inje\u00E7\u00E3o\" with Tigrona at the 2005 TIM Festival in Brazil was a critical and fan success. \"Bucky Done Gun\" was included in the soundtrack of NBA Live 06, renamed and re-edited as \"Bucky Done.\""@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"Disposable Teens\" is a song by American industrial metal band Marilyn Manson. It is the first single from their fourth full-length studio album, Holy Wood (In the Shadow of the Valley of Death), released in 2000. It was released in two standalone physical formats. The first, titled \"Disposable Teens Pt. 1,\" was released on November 6, 2000 in the UK. It features Manson's cover of John Lennon's \"Working Class Hero\". The second, titled \"Disposable Teens Pt. 2,\" followed on November 14, 2000 and features a cover of The Doors' \"Five to One\". \"Disposable Teens Pt. 2\" was also released as a 12\" picture disc vinyl LP. It is considered a teenage anthem of sorts, echoing what Manson see as teenagers who act violently in retaliation against parental and social authority. The chorus borrows lyrically from The Beatles' song, \"Revolution.\" The song also paraphrases George Orwell's book Nineteen Eighty-Four, \"Rebel from the waist down\", the original line being \"You're only a rebel from the waist down'. Here, it has been given new meaning as a pop culture reference to Elvis Presley's infamous swiveling hips, satirizing the assertion that they, and by extension rock 'n' roll, had caused the \"decline of Western Civilization\" and given rise to 'disposable teens'. The song is featured in Book of Shadows: Blair Witch 2 during the opening credits. Professional wrestler Christopher Daniels has used the song as his theme in Ring of Honor and several independent promotions, as well as an instrumental remix for Total Nonstop Action Wrestling made by TNA's official music composer Dale Oliver. The song is also featured as downloadable content for Rock Band as part of the \"Mayhem Tour Pack\" and as a playable track for Guitar Hero Live."@en ;

As was often the case with Smiths singles, it did not appear on an original studio album. It can be found on the Louder Than Bombs, Singles, The World Won't Listen and Sound of The Smiths compilations. Another newly completed song, \"You Just Haven't Earned It Yet, Baby\", was originally intended to be the A-side of this single. The single even made it to the white label test pressing stage and approximately 900 stock copies of the single were manufactured before the proper single was issued. This aborted single mix can be heard on the UK compilation The World Won't Listen, while the song was later remixed for the American compilation Louder Than Bombs. The title alludes to the communist slogan \"Workers of the world, unite!\", and[citation needed] the 1966 David and Jonathan hit 'Lovers of the World Unite'. The sleeve features a photograph of a young Elvis Presley that was taken by James R. Reid. During a 1987 interview with Shaun Duggan, Morrissey explained the meaning of the song as follows: \"It's more or less spiritual shoplifting, cultural shoplifting, taking things and using them to your own advantage.\" Musically the song bears a strong resemblance to the T.Rex song \"Children of the Revolution\". Both Morrissey and Johnny Marr are Marc Bolan fans, and Marr has admitted in an interview that the melody for a previous Smiths single, \"Panic\", was copied from \"Metal Guru\". The heavy metal band Pist.on recorded a cover of \"Shoplifters of the World Unite\" on their 1996 album Number One. South African band Sugardrive covered the song on a 2002 holiday album.

The b-side was a new song \"Made in Heaven\" which also served as the b-side to both \"Je Ne Sais Pas Pourquoi\" and \"It's No Secret\" in other international territories. \"Turn It into Love\" was the sixth single to be released from the album Kylie and was written and produced by Stock Aitken Waterman. Considered something of a hidden gem, Kylie performed the song (as part of medleys) during her On A Night Like This Tour and Showgirl Homecoming shows in the 2000s, as well the Mushroom Records 25th birthday concert in Melbourne, Australia in 1998. Also a favourite track among Stock Aitken Waterman enthusiasts, the song also featured on the 2005 UK compilation album Stock Aitken Waterman Gold, one of just two tracks included that were not released as a single in the UK."@en ;

The song was co-written by Kiesza and Rami Samir Afuni, and produced by the latter. \"Giant in My Heart\" is an electropop and house track sung in an emotive falsetto tone and features a combination of scat-singing, a pounding 808 and softer synth-led sections. Lyrically, the song focuses on subjects of love lost and the aftermath of a breakup. \"Giant in My Heart\" garnered positive reviews from contemporary music critics, who commended the song for its sonic similarities with Kiesza's debut single \"Hideaway\" and the singer's strong vocal performance. It was a commercial success, debuting at number four on the UK Singles Chart, number one on the UK Dance Chart and selling 33,414 copies in its first week. \"Giant in My Heart\" marked Kiesza's second consecutive top five single in the United Kingdom and has also had success in Germany and Belgium where it peaked at numbers 11 and 12 respectively. The song was accompanied by a short film music video directed by producer Afuni in New York City. The clip premiered on July 1, 2014 and was acclaimed by several critics. It features a frustrated male office worker living a double life as a crossdresser. Kiesza has performed \"Giant in My Heart\" on American television show Jimmy Kimmel Live!, and the song has been covered by English singer Florrie."@en ;

It was first released in 1972 as the final track on the album Seventh Sojourn. \"I'm Just a Singer (In a Rock and Roll Band)\" was later released as a single in 1973, with \"For My Lady\" on the B-side. It was the second single released from Seventh Sojourn, with the first being \"Isn't Life Strange\" (also written by John Lodge). \"I'm Just a Singer (In a Rock and Roll Band)\" was written by the Moody Blues' bassist John Lodge, who won an ASCAP songwriting award for it. It is one of John Lodge's signature high-energy rock and roll songs, and is one of his best-known compositions for the Moody Blues, along with \"Ride My See-Saw.\" \"I'm Just a Singer (In a Rock and Roll Band)\" was the final single by The Moody Blues to feature the use of the Chamberlin (which had recently replaced the similar instrument, the Mellotron). The Chamberlin would later be replaced by a more modern keyboard synthesizer. A promotional music-video was filmed for \"I'm Just a Singer (In a Rock and Roll Band)\". This video showed The Moody Blues' flautist Ray Thomas playing a Baritone Saxophone. However, the saxophone was used just for effect in the video. The saxophone sound actually comes from the Chamberlin. \"I'm Just a Singer (In a Rock and Roll Band)\" reached #12 on the Billboard Hot 100 in the U.S., becoming one of their highest-charting hits in that country, but fared less well in their native UK, where it managed #36. It was also the final single released by the Moody Blues prior to their five year hiatus, which was agreed upon so each of the band members could pursue their own solo careers. Their next single would not be until 1978, with \"Steppin' in a Slide Zone.\""@en ;

Written by Anastacia, Sam Watters, and Louis Biancaniello, the song was released as the lead single from her debut album, Not That Kind (2000). In the U.S. \"I'm Outta Love\" is Anastacia's only single to chart on the Billboard Hot 100, peaking at number eighty-two, but was nevertheless a success on Billboard's dance charts, where it reached number two for 8 consecutive weeks on the Hot Dance Club Play and Hot Dance Airplay charts. The song is also noted as the first song in US Billboard Hot 100 history to debut at a chart position below the top 40 of the charts, climb up a few places and stay at that peak for more than three consecutive weeks. The song peaked at number 82 and stayed consecutively at this peak for seven weeks before falling off the charts. This record would only be broken in 2003 by Blu Cantrell's song \"Breathe\" featuring Sean Paul, which debuted at 59, but then peaked at 41 and stayed there for nine consecutive weeks. However, even with the moderate success of the song in the US, the song was met with both critical acclaim and extreme commercial success outside of the US, launching Anastacia into superstar status where it peaked in Australia, Belgium (Flanders and Wallonia), and New Zealand, and reached the top ten in Austria, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Switzerland, and the UK. The song ended 2000 as Europe's fourth best-selling single, as well as the year's top-selling single in both Australia and New Zealand, and has gone on to become one of the singer's signature hits."@en ;

The song was first recorded by Gene Cotton prior to the Bellamy Brothers, but Cotton never secured the rights. The song was a crossover hit in the United States, reaching Number One on the 1976 Billboard Hot 100 charts, #2 on Hot Adult Contemporary Tracks, and #21 on Hot Country Singles. It was also an international hit, landing on the charts in the UK, Scandinavia and West Germany, where the Bellamy Brothers' record spent five weeks at #1. In 2008, the song re-entered the UK Singles Chart following its appearance in an advertisement in the United Kingdom for Barclaycard, where it peaked at #21. In other media, it was used in the 1980 Tatum O'Neal film Little Darlings, the 2008 period drama Swingtown, and season 2 episode 'No Room at the Inn' of the HBO series The Leftovers. The song has been covered by numerous other artists, most notably Joan Baez, who included it on her 1979 Honest Lullaby album. Another re-recording by the Bellamy brothers with G\u00F6l\u00E4 is included on the album The Greatest Hits Sessions. \"Ein Bett im Kornfeld\", a German language adaptation of the song recorded by J\u00FCrgen Drews, spent eleven weeks at #1 in West Germany in 1976."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"Long Haired Lover from Liverpool\" is a pop song by Little Jimmy Osmond. Written by Christopher Kingsley (somehow credited as Christopher Dowden on the UK release) and produced by Mike Curb and Perry Botkin Jr, \"Long Haired Lover from Liverpool\" was a UK number one single for Jimmy Osmond. Riding high on the popularity of The Osmonds, Jimmy (the youngest sibling) had a massive hit with the song, in the process becoming the youngest person to ever reach number one on the UK Singles Chart aged 9 years 8 months. A UK number one for five weeks in December 1972, it was the Christmas number one that year, and has since sold over a million copies in the UK. It also reached #2 on the Australian Singles Chart (Kent Music Report) and #38 on the US, Billboard Hot 100. Kingsley's 1969 version was an unsuccessful single, played by then-popular MOR station KMPC, Los Angeles. However, Kingsley's record distributed by MGM, where the Osmonds recorded, was where Jimmy's mother first heard \"Long Haired Lover From Liverpool\" and thought it would be a great song for the youngest member of the Osmond family. Mike Curb, president of MGM and producer of the Osmonds agreed and recorded Jimmy. The timing could not have been better, as Osmond-mania was sweeping the UK and the Osmond family was embarking on a major UK-European promotional tour. Politics at the UK record company almost stopped the record from being released as a single, but through the efforts of Virgin Ear Music (a Richard Kaye Publishing Company - worldwide copyright owner of \"Long Haired Lover From Liverpool\") and his UK sub-publishers the Little Jimmy Osmond record was released.[citation needed]"@en ;

It reached #56 on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Singles & Tracks charts and #12 on the Hot Rap Singles chart, though, because of its \"party and bullshit formula\" and \"percussive choral loop\". Its popularity landed it on two Beatnuts hits compilations: Beatnuts Forever and Classic Nuts, Vol. 1.

In this song, it is the father who is giving pearls of wisdom, advising Smokey, as the song's narrator, about the importance of \"being a man\", being loyal, and treating your wife or girlfriend right, despite the fact that every man has \"a boy in his heart\" that would lead him to do otherwise.\"(You Can't Let the Boy Overpower) The Man in You'.

	dbo:abstract	"\"Breathe\" is a song by British synthpop duo Erasure. It was released by Mute Records in the UK and the U.S. as the first single from the band's eleventh studio album Nightbird. Written and produced by Vince Clarke and Andy Bell, the track is a mid-tempo love song similar in musical style to their 1994 hit \"Always\", albeit with more uplifting lyrical content. \"Breathe\" was remixed slightly for its radio version \u2014 most notably in the song's introduction. The UK compact disc single included CD-ROM information that allowed buyers to download the Digipro software package and use isolated musical tracks of \"Breathe\" to create their own remixes. For a time fans were able to upload their finished \"Breathe\" remixes to Erasure's website to share with others. The single was widely regarded as a major return to form by critics and fans alike, leading to comparisons to Erasure's glory days of the late 1980s and early 1990s, when The Innocents and Chorus both topped the UK album charts. \"Breathe\" also resonated with the record-buying public and hit number four on the UK singles chart, Erasure's highest-charting UK single since \"Always\" a decade earlier. In the United States, Erasure entered the Hot Dance Club Play chart for the first time in eight years and scored their second U.S. dance chart-topper \u2014 the first being \"Victim of Love\" in 1987. In Germany, \"Breathe\" was Erasure's twentieth Top 40 single, peaking at number thirty-five. It topped the singles chart in Denmark. On the Top 60 chats in Sweden it peaked at 33."@en ;

It was released as the third single in Australia, New Zealand and selected European countries, and the fourth single in France. The song is a calypso-styled, mid-tempo ballad, and is about breaking up with one's old partner and finding someone new. Although \"Eh, Eh (Nothing Else I Can Say)\" was never released as a single in her home country, it received mostly negative reviews from US based critics; who denoted it as \"dry and lifeless\", blaming it for halting the \"bad-girl party atmosphere\" of The Fame. Failing to match the popularity of her previous singles, the song peaked at number fifteen on the Australian ARIA Charts and at number nine on the RIANZ charts of New Zealand. It proved to be successful in Sweden, where it managed to go as far as number two on the Sverigetopplistan chart, as well as Czech Republic, France, and Hungary where it reached the top-ten of the singles charts. \"Eh, Eh (Nothing Else I Can Say)\" received gold certifications from Australia, Denmark, New Zealand, and France. The accompanying Italian-American 1950s-themed music video portrayed Gaga and her friends roaming around the streets of an Italian neighborhood, Gaga riding a Vespa and also singing the song while at home with her boyfriend. The video was noted for its contrasting portrayal of Gaga doing feminine work, as compared to her previous endeavours. She performed \"Eh, Eh (Nothing Else I Can Say)\" on her first headlining The Fame Ball Tour, wearing a black-and-white leotard, and the 2009 shows of The Monster Ball Tour while standing inside a giant gyroscope."@en ;

The song is also the band's first entry into adult contemporary stations; the first stations being on CFIT-FM Calgary, CKSY-FM Chatham-Kent, CJRL-FM Kenora & WNIC Detroit. \"Lost in You\" is considered somewhat unusual for the band. The song expresses a more affectionate sentiment than is typically found in the band's music. While electric guitars still play a prominent role, the focus is on Adam Gontier's voice and the melody. The song, unlike much of the band's other works, is quite positive. It is a song written with simple words: \"Let me inside, let me get close to you / Change your mind, I'll get lost if you want me to / Somehow I found a way to get lost in you.\" The lyrics are bittersweet as Gontier sings about a love that has its ups and downs. On March 15, 2011, the band released an EP, via online download, containing the piano version of \"World So Cold\" and a cover of the Fleetwood Mac song \"The Chain\" in promotion of \"Lost in You\"."@en ;

As its predecessor, the song is a danz\u00F3n that mixes a powerful guitar and trumpet intro with a salsa background driven by a piano through all the song. The lyrics make reference to a person \"who hates itself for being so in love with someone\", but some music critics suggested it may no refer to a person specifically, but to a place. Gloria confirmed on her documentary, 90 Millas, that is one of her favorite songs from the album. Although a music video was filmed and the song received remix treatment, including a duet featuring rapper Fat Joe, the song couldn't match the success of \"No Llores\", and was only released to promote the album only at the US on Spanish-language radio-stations."@en ;

In the United States, it peaked at number 25 on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart, and number 89 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. The accompanying music video was co-directed by Godfrey Taberez and Brown, and filmed at Universal Studios in Los Angeles, California. It displays intimate scenes of Brown and his lover partaking in sexual activity, women levitating out of their beds, and Brown dancing. Critics were complimentary of the video's sexual themes and presentation."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"Two Out of Three Ain't Bad\" is a love song performed by the American musician Meat Loaf in his solo career, preceded by \"You Took the Words Right Out of My Mouth\" and followed by \"Paradise by the Dashboard Light\". It is a track off his 1977 album Bat Out of Hell, written by Jim Steinman. It reached #11 on the Billboard Hot 100 and earned a million-selling Gold single from the RIAA. It stands as one of his career signature tunes, still enjoying recurrent airplay. It was the final song written for the album. In a 2003 interview for the VH1 Ultimate Albums series, Steinman recalls: A music video was shot for the single and received significant airplay on television video programs of that day, a number of years before the conception of MTV. Two mixes were created for the song. In the album mix, timed around 5:27, one can hear prominent Moog-synthesizer embellishments by session keyboardist Roger Powell. The single mix, timed around 3:50, downmixes the synthesizer considerably, in place of a much warmer and predominant string arrangement by Ken Ascher. This mix also edits out and removes the first lyrical bridge of the song which includes the line, \"There ain't no Coupe de Ville hiding at the bottom of a Cracker Jack box\", and does some overlapping, splicing and editing to seamlessly merge back into the second part of the lyrical bridge, starting with, \"I can't lie, I can't tell you that I'm something I'm not\". Yet, another lyrical edit in the last verse removes the lines, \"And though I know I'll never get her out of my heart, she never loved me back, Ooh I know, well I remember how she left me on a stormy night, oh she kissed me and got out of our bed\". Lastly, a song fade-out beginning in the middle of the ending chorus' second refrain is also featured, hence removing the full-circle lyrics of \"Baby we can talk all night, but that ain't getting us nowhere,\" that both started and ended the song, in its full album mix version."@en ;

Lauded for its homage to production sound and vocal performance, \"Wrapped in Red\" was met with a positive reception from music critics, who regarded it a candidate to be a future holiday classic along with \"Underneath the Tree\".

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Abacab_(song)>	rdf:type	dbo:MusicalWork ;
	dbo:abstract	"\"Abacab\" is a song by the British rock band Genesis, released on 14 August 1981. It was produced by Genesis and distributed in the United States by Atlantic Records and Warner Music Group. The song, written by Tony Banks, Phil Collins, and Mike Rutherford, was featured on Genesis' album of the same name. The song was the second single from the album in the US, where it peaked at No. 26 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart in early 1982. It stayed in the Top 40 for 6 weeks. It was also a top 10 hit on the British pop chart, where it peaked at No. 9. The title is taken from the structure of an early version of the song. Guitarist Mike Rutherford explained in an interview that the band labelled various sections of the song with letters of the alphabet, and at one point the sections were ordered A-B-A-C-A-B. Rutherford commented that the completed song no longer followed this format, but the name was kept nevertheless.[citation needed] The track was regularly performed on the band's 1981 Abacab tour, the 1982 Three Sides Live Encore Tour, the 1983/84 Mama Tour and the 1986/87 Invisible Touch tours. On the first two tours, Phil Collins would sing the chorus in a high falsetto while Banks and Rutherford sang the lower harmonies. For the later tours, Collins would sing the chorus in a lower octave while Rutherford sang the higher falsetto harmonies. Genesis rehearsed the song for the 2007 reunion, but it was not included in the final setlist. The song has been covered by Umphrey's McGee live.[citation needed] The song's LP version has an extensive instrumental arrangement as an outro, while the single edit eliminates that entirely and recycles part of the opening arrangement as an outro.[citation needed]"@en ;

dbr:Hey_God	rdf:type	dbo:MusicalWork ;
	dbo:abstract	"\"Hey God\" is a single from Bon Jovi's 1995 album These Days. As with most of the songs on These Days, \"Hey God\" is one of Bon Jovi's darker songs. It brings together different stories of people living on the edge of breakdown and despair, such as a father who claims his family are \"two paychecks away from living out on the street\", a single mother with a wayward son who has been convicted of killing a police officer, and a young man growing up in the ghetto. Throughout the course of the song, each of these characters cries out for spiritual help.The song is influenced by the blues and country music but many fans considered it a Grunge song, as it has similarities to alternative rock. Richie Sambora claimed that inspiration for the song came when he was sitting in his limo and made eye contact with a derelict huddling in a cardboard box on the pavement. Sambora's sense of guilt at this was immense and after discussing the incident with Jon Bon Jovi, they wrote \"Hey God\". The song charted at #13 in the UK Singles Chart and #58 on the Euro hot 100 singles chart. \"Hey God\", like most of the songs from the album, is rarely played live by the band. A performance of the song can be seen as part of the encore from the Live From London DVD. In 2008, the song made a comeback in some of the band's concerts during their Lost Highway Tour. \"Hey God\" is one of the few Bon Jovi songs to feature no backing vocal track.

Released as a single, with \"Run Through the Jungle\" on the flipside, the double-sided single climbed to number four on the Billboard Hot 100 chart in the spring of 1970. It was certified gold by the RIAA for sales of over one million copies. It was also a major hit in the UK, where it reached number three on the UK Singles Chart. The song is opened with a prominent, high-pitched guitar riff played by John Fogerty. The song's lyrics have Fogerty telling of a gathering \"up around the bend\" on the highway and inviting the listener to join in. The song has been covered by artists such as Elton John, who recorded a version of the song early in his career, and Finnish rock band Hanoi Rocks, who covered it on their 1984 album, Two Steps from the Move."@en ;

The song was a disappointment in the United States, peaking at #77 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, although it fared much better on the R&B singles chart - where it reached the Top 10 - helped by BET's heavy rotation of the music video. In the song's original copyright registration from 11 March 1985 it was credited to Barry Gibb and Maurice Gibb. It was not until Michael Jackson heard the demo of it that he suggested the chorus could be improved.

	dbo:abstract	"\"I'll Feel a Whole Lot Better\" is a song by the Los Angeles folk rock band The Byrds that was first released in June 1965 on the B-side of the band's second single, \"All I Really Want to Do\". It was also included on The Byrds' debut album, Mr. Tambourine Man. Written by Gene Clark, who also sings the lead vocal, \"I'll Feel a Whole Lot Better\" features some of The Byrds' early musical trademarks, including Jim McGuinn's jangling 12-string Rickenbacker guitar; Clark's pounding tambourine; McGuinn, Clark and David Crosby's complex harmony singing; and a country-influenced guitar solo. Although it was initially released as a B-side, \"I'll Feel a Whole Lot Better\" was itself heavily promoted by Columbia Records during the time that \"All I Really Want to Do\" spent on the Billboard charts. As a result, the song actually managed to chart in its own right at number 103. Since its release, the song has become a rock music standard, inspiring a number of cover versions over the years. It is also considered by many critics to be one of the band's, as well as Clark's, best and most popular songs, with Rolling Stone magazine ranking it at number 234 on their list of The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time."@en ;

It made its radio debut on 9 July 2007 on Australian radio stations, and was subsequently released as a single and digital download on 4 August 2007 in Australia, 3 September 2007 in New Zealand, and 13 August 2007 in the United States. The song was written by Powderfinger lead singer Bernard Fanning, and influenced by bassist John Collins. The riff was then developed by guitarist Ian Haug. The song is about reconciling difficulties and arguments, rather than shifting the blame. \"I Don't Remember\" was lauded by some reviewers, who appreciated its energy, while other reviewers were more critical, dubbing it an \"advertisement song\". The music video also received critical acclaim, especially for the parodies it contained. Despite the reviews, the single charted poorly, reaching number 42 on the ARIA Singles Chart."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"Johnny and Mary\" is a song written and originally performed by Robert Palmer. Palmer's version was recorded in 1980 at Compass Point Studios, New Providence, in the Bahamas. The song was featured on Palmer's album Clues (1980). \"Johnny and Mary\" went to no. 44 on the UK Singles Chart, and was a top 40 hit in Canada, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa and several European countries. In Germany, it peaked at no. 7 on the singles chart and spent a total of 23 weeks in the Top 20. In France, it reached no. 2 while in Spain, it peaked at no. 1 on the Spanish singles chart (AFYVE). Though the single did not chart in the US Hot 100, it did reach no. 18 on Billboard's Club Play Singles chart. \"Johnny and Mary\" was used as the signature tune in advertisements promoting Renault cars throughout the 1980s and 1990s. Early adverts used Palmer's original version, while a range of special recordings in different styles were produced during the 1990s, most famously an acoustic interpretation by Martin Taylor, which he released on his album Spirit of Django. Taylor recorded alternate versions for Renault; the last being in 1998 for the launch of the all-new Renault Clio. AllMusic suggests that \"Johnny and Mary\" was the inspiration for Rod Stewart's later hit \"Young Turks\"."@en ;

dbr:Juxtapozed_with_U	rdf:type	dbo:MusicalWork ;
	dbo:abstract	"\"Juxtapozed with U\" is the thirteenth single by Super Furry Animals. It was the first single to be taken from the Rings Around the World album and reached number 14 on the UK Singles Chart on its release in July 2001. The song was initially conceived as a duet but, after both Brian Harvey and Bobby Brown turned the band down, lead singer Gruff Rhys sang the entire track, using a vocoder on the verses to imitate another person. Musically \"Juxtapozed with U\" has echoes of Philadelphia soul and the \"plastic soul\" of David Bowie's album Young Americans and was inspired by the Paul McCartney and Stevie Wonder track \"Ebony and Ivory\". Rhys has claimed that he sees \"Juxtapozed with U\" as \"fairly subversive\" because its polished pop style was in stark contrast to the \"macho\" guitar music the band felt was prevalent in 2001. Critical reaction to the track was generally positive with some reviewers describing it as the band's best single to date. A promotional music video was produced to accompany \"Juxtapozed with U\"'s release as a single. Directed by Dawn of the New Assembly/H5 the video features a computer generated women and man seen as thermal images. The couple drive around New York and attend a party on the top floor of a skyscraper which is enveloped in flames towards the end of the track. An alternative video, directed by Fukme 99, was included on the DVD version of Rings Around the World. This video features three people walking through the streets of Hammersmith, dressed in cardboard costumes as a camcorder, clapperboard and microphone. The characters meet up with a fourth person wearing a large cardboard head and arms and then dance with several other people dressed in cardboard outside a group of warehouse. The DVD version of Rings Around the World also includes two remixes of \"(Drawing) Rings Around the World\" by Lesser and the Super Furry Animals themselves."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"Love's Great Adventure\" is a single released by Ultravox on 12 October 1984. Having enjoyed massive radio airplay that autumn, the single became Ultravox's thirteenth Top 30 single in Britiain, and was their last major hit in the UK, peaking at #12 in the UK Singles Chart. The style of this single is different from any of their preceding Lament singles, aiming for a more lightweight, pop-oriented approach. The music video features the band members in a humorous parody of Indiana Jones, with Midge Ure being chased across deserts and forests by a ruthless treasure hunter. Midge Ure stated in his autobiography, If I Was, that the aim of the single and its video was to promote Ultravox as having a sense of humour, away from the seriousness of their previous releases. Also in the video is Ure's future wife Annabel Giles. The music in the video stops halfway through where a seemingly exhausted Midge Ure, tired from minutes of endless running around has to sit down for a moment and take a breather. He rests for a moment then takes a breath before standing up recovered and continuing with the song at which point the music starts up once again. The song, based on a riff for a Levi's jeans commercial which was not taken up by the company, was not released on a studio album, instead appearing on their 1984 compilation album The Collection."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"Loves Me Like a Rock\" is a 1973 song written and recorded by American singer-songwriter Paul Simon. The song appears on his solo album There Goes Rhymin' Simon. It features background vocals from the Dixie Hummingbirds, a Southern black gospel group. These vocals add a different texture to the song as compared to many of his previous solo recordings (\"Mother and Child Reunion\", \"Kodachrome\") and his duets with his frequent collaborator, Art Garfunkel, as the pop duo Simon & Garfunkel (\"The Sounds of Silence\", \"Mrs. Robinson\"). Although the lyrics are not typically associated with gospel music, the Dixie Hummingbirds were eager to record the song with Simon, and they recorded their own version of the song soon afterward. Paul Simon's version of \"Loves Me Like a Rock\" peaked at No. 2 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart the week of October 6, 1973, kept from the summit by Cher's \"Half-Breed\". It remained in the Top 40 for 14 weeks and was certified a gold record. It also spent two weeks atop the Billboard easy listening chart in September 1973. It reached the Top 40 in the United Kingdom, peaking at No. 39 on the UK Singles Chart. The gospel version of \"Loves Me Like a Rock\" by the Dixie Hummingbirds reached No. 72 on the Billboard R&B chart and won the group a Grammy for Best Soul Gospel performance in 1974.

The song was written by singer Gruff Rhys and was inspired by the El Ni\u00F1o phenomenon. The track's title refers to the Aurora Borealis, a natural light display which the band were convinced they had seen prior to the song being written. Rhys wrote the melody for \"Northern Lites\" several years before it was completed but only decided on a calypso style after he wrote the lyrics. The steel drums on the track are played by keyboardist Cian Ciaran and were added on the spur of the moment after the group saw them \"lying around\" Real World Studios during recording. Critical reaction was largely positive with the song being named \"Single of the Week\" in both the Melody Maker and NME, with the latter also listing the song at number 3 in their single of the year list for 1999. The music video for \"Northern Lites\" was directed by Super Furry Animals and Martin McCarthy and features footage of curling and Irish road bowling although Rhys has blamed the song's failure to chart higher on the fact that it \"didn't have a video\"."@en ;

dbr:Something_So_Strong	rdf:type	dbo:MusicalWork ;
	dbo:abstract	"\"Something So Strong\" is a rock song written by Neil Finn and Mitchell Froom and performed by the band Crowded House for their eponymous debut album (June 1986). The track was released as the album's fifth and final single in April 1987. The single peaked at No. 18 on the Australian Kent Music Report Singles Chart, No. 3 in New Zealand, No. 7 in the United States Billboard Hot 100, and No. 10 on the Canadian RPM 100. The track lends its title to the book, Crowded House: Something So Strong (1997), by Australian biographer Chris Bourke, which details the band's career from forming to just after their breakup in 1996. According to Bourke, \"Something So Strong\", was the first song written by Finn specifically for Crowded House. However while in the studio, producer, Froom, and Finn reworked parts of the song and as such, Froom is credited as a co-writer. Demos of this song have been linked to Finn's earlier band Split Enz, from the 1984 See Ya 'Round period, potentially making the timeline earlier on this track. The song, though in a different version by Crowded House, is playing during the end-credits of the 1999 Bryan Brown-film, Dear Claudia. The track is included in the various artists' 3\u00D7 CD, Flood Relief: Artists for the Flood Appeal (January 2011), which raised money for victims of the Queensland floods. A sample of \"Something So Strong\" plays during a TV spot of Flood Relief."@en ;

Unlike the previous three, this song fell short of reaching the pop top forty peaking at number 44 on the Billboard Hot 100 but reached number ten on the R&B singles chart making it the fourth consecutive top ten hit on Moods...

The more famous and successful recording by Presley was released in August 1961 and remains one of a few of his recordings that tend to have appeal for non-fans. The relatively intense tune, featuring a Bo Diddley beat, performed well on both pop and easy listening stations, reaching No. 4 on the Billboard Hot 100, and No. 2 on the Easy Listening chart, based (at the time) on the Top 100. However, the single's Hot 100 chart run was atypical of a Top Ten hit. In the autumn of 1961 it shot from 22 to 4, then dropped to 10, then 26, all within the space of four weeks. The single (a double A-side with \"Little Sister\", as in the States) spent four weeks at No. 1 in the UK Singles Chart \u2014 one of Presley's nine UK chart-toppers between 1960 and 1962."@en ;

In the U.S. it became the b-side to his single \"Freedom\" and peaked at #24 on the Billboard Adult Contemporary chart. Critics saw the song as a ballad in which McCartney tries to come to terms with the death of his wife Linda, singing \"let me love again\"; McCartney, however, was less certain whom the song was about in an interview on Howard Stern's radio show. The Guardian called it a \"masterpiece... so delicate and honest that it sounds pretty much perfect.\" \"From a Lover to a Friend\" was recorded on 27 February 2001 with Paul playing bass and piano, Abe Laboriel, Jr. playing drums, Rusty Anderson on 12-string electric guitar, and Gabe Dixon on piano."@en ;

Kath also produced the re-worked track. The song contains prominent electro and chiptune musical characteristics. The track consists of only three lyric lines and has been said to tell a story about the sadness and ennui one might experience when locked inside a Pac-Man maze for eternity.[citation needed] \"Crimewave\" achieved critical praise from most contemporary music critics. Critics complimented the song's originality and emotion it brought to the electronic music scene. The single was accompanied by a music video upon its re-release in 2008.

	dbo:abstract	"\"Deja Vu (Uptown Baby)\" is a song by American hip hop duo Lord Tariq and Peter Gunz, released in January 1998, as the lead single from their debut album, Make It Reign. The song, produced by production team KNS, was a huge success for Tariq and Gunz, becoming a hit in both the United States and in Canada, peaking at number nine on the US Billboard Hot 100 and at number six on the Canadian Singles Chart. It was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) on March 31, 1998 for sales of one million copies. However, the duo's success would be short-lived, as they broke up in 1999 without releasing a follow-up album or single. Three remixes were made for the song. The Frankenstein remix produced by Frank \"Frankenstein\" Fallico, the Pro Black remix produced by Ayatollah and a Bad Boy remix that was made by Mase, The LOX and Puff Daddy. The song is built around a sample of Steely Dan's \"Black Cow.\" However, Steely Dan successfully sued the production for copyright infringement, since Black Cow was sampled without first obtaining copyright permission from the songwriters and their publishing company, which led to the great majority of the money generated from Deja Vu being forfeited back to Steely Dan. The song Daydreamin' by Tatyana Ali released later in 1998 used the same Black Cow sample and featured both Tariq and Gunz. Gunz even mentions hearing Black Cow and being inspired to rap to the beat."@en ;

In Elle magazine, the song was named one of 10 \"essential\" songs produced by Jack White. NME listed the single as one of 20 \"unspeakably exciting\" songs by White. NME and Rolling Stone pointed out the song's emphatic guitar work based on \"Jack Lawrence's grunting fuzz bass [and] Dean Fertita's abrasive skidding guitar\". Spin said the guitar runs were \"Sabbath-worthy\", referring to the hard rock of Black Sabbath. White's vocals were seen to bury those of singer Alison Mosshart. Antiquiet observed that the song was unusual for the Dead Weather in that it felt like a solo piece featuring White. The song was featured briefly in the E4 comedy-drama television series Misfits in Episode 2, Season 2.

The song has been compared to her previous hip hop-flavored dance songs, \"Goodies\", and \"Work\", and has also been compared to Missy Elliott's \"Work It\". \"Gimmie Dat\" was released as the third single from Basic Instinct on October 15, 2010. In some countries, the song was released alongside \"Speechless\", as a dual single. \"Gimmie Dat\" was well received by music critics, who compliment its uptempo beat. Although the song was well received by critics, it only managed to peak at the lower half of US and UK charts. An official remix of the song, dubbed the \"Slow Bass Remix\" was released in the United States on December 21, 2010. It was later confirmed that Ciara had paid for the music video, radio play and promotion of the single herself because the label refused to do so. According to Ciara, her record label even told radio stations to stop playing the song. \"Gimmie Dat\" was Ciara's final single released under LaFace Records, which she had her contract released from due to Basic Instinct's underperforming sales."@en ;

It was recorded and produced by Paul Draper and Mark 'Spike' Stent with additional production by Mike Hunter during sessions for the group's second studio album. The song was re-recorded with New York producer Arthur Baker in a simpler arrangement produced and mixed by Baker and released as the fourth and final single in early 1999 from the group's second album, Six. The Baker version charted better than its predecessor in the typically quiet post-Christmas singles market returning the group to the top twenty in the UK peaking at #16. The single version of \"Six\" has none of the experimental rock sound that is representative of the parent album as a whole. In the US, Baker's single version appears in place of the album version on Epic Records' truncated version of Six. The music video for \"Six\" was directed by Grant Gee."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"Rock Around the Clock\" is a rock and roll song in the 12-bar blues format written by Max C. Freedman and James E. Myers (the latter under the pseudonym \"Jimmy De Knight\") in 1952. The best-known and most successful rendition was recorded by Bill Haley & His Comets in 1954 for American Decca. It was a number one single on both the US and UK charts and also re-entered the UK Singles Chart in the 1960s and 1970s. It was not the first rock and roll record, nor was it the first successful record of the genre (Bill Haley had American chart success with \"Crazy Man, Crazy\" in 1953, and in 1954, \"Shake, Rattle and Roll\" sung by Big Joe Turner reached No. 1 on the Billboard R&B chart). Haley's recording nevertheless became an anthem for rebellious 1950s youth and is widely considered to be the song that, more than any other, brought rock and roll into mainstream culture around the world. The song is ranked No. 158 on the Rolling Stone magazine's list of The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time. Although first recorded by Italian-American band Sonny Dae and His Knights on March 20, 1954, the more famous version by Bill Haley & His Comets is not, strictly speaking, a cover version. Myers claimed the song had been written specifically for Haley but, for various reasons, Haley was unable to record it himself until April 12, 1954. The original full title of the song was \"We're Gonna Rock Around the Clock Tonight!\". This was later shortened to \"(We're Gonna) Rock Around the Clock\", though this form is generally only used on releases of the 1954 Bill Haley Decca Records recording; most other recordings of this song by Haley and others (including Sonny Dae) shorten this title further to \"Rock Around the Clock\"."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"Bohemian Rhapsody\" is a song by the British rock band Queen. It was written by Freddie Mercury for the band's 1975 studio album A Night at the Opera. It is a six-minute suite, consisting of several sections without a chorus: an intro, a ballad segment, an operatic passage, a hard rock part and a reflective coda. The song is a more accessible take on the 1970s progressive rock genre. It was the most expensive single ever made at the time of its release. When it was released as a single, \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" became a commercial success, staying at the top of the UK Singles Chart for nine weeks and selling more than a million copies by the end of January 1976. It reached number one again in 1991 for another five weeks when the same version was re-released, eventually becoming the UK's third best-selling single of all time. It topped the charts in several other markets as well, including Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Ireland and The Netherlands, later becoming one of the best-selling singles of all time. In the United States the song originally peaked at number nine in 1976. It returned to the chart at number two in 1992 following its appearance in the film Wayne's World, which revived its American popularity. Although critical reaction was initially mixed, \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" remains one of Queen's most popular songs and is frequently placed on modern lists of the greatest songs of all time. The single was accompanied by a promotional video, which many scholars consider ground-breaking. Rolling Stone magazine states: \"Its influence cannot be overstated, practically inventing the music video seven years before MTV went on the air.\" In 2004, \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame. In 2012, the song topped the list on an ITV nationwide poll in the UK to find \"The Nation's Favourite Number One\" over 60 years of music."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\" is a song by the American rock band Nirvana. It is the opening track and lead single from the band's second album, Nevermind (1991), released on DGC Records. Written by Kurt Cobain, Krist Novoselic, and Dave Grohl and produced by Butch Vig, the song uses a verse-chorus form where the main four-chord riff is used during the intro and chorus to create an alternating loud and quiet dynamic. The sound of the song (as Cobain admitted) is modeled after the sound of the Pixies. The unexpected success of \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\" in late 1991 propelled Nevermind to the top of the charts at the start of 1992, an event often marked as the point where alternative rock entered the mainstream. \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\" was Nirvana's biggest hit, reaching number six on the Billboard Hot 100 and placing high on music industry charts all around the world in 1991 and 1992. \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\" received many critical plaudits, including topping the Village Voice Pazz & Jop critics' poll and winning two MTV Video Music Awards for its music video, which was in heavy rotation on music television. The song was dubbed an \"anthem for apathetic kids\" of Generation X, but the band grew uncomfortable with the success and attention it received as a result. In the years since Cobain's death, listeners and critics have continued to praise \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\" as one of the greatest songs of all time."@en ;

It was released on February 28, 2006, by Epic Records as the second single from the album. The song was written and produced by Shakira, Jean, Jerry 'Wonder' Duplessis and LaTavia Parker. \"Hips Don't Lie\" is a salsa and worldbeat song, which heavily incorporates samples from Jean's earlier single \"Dance Like This\" and \"Amores Como el Nuestro\" written by Omar Alfanno. Upon its release, \"Hips Don't Lie\" received generally favorable reviews from music critics. It received several accolades, including a People's Choice Award, an MTV Latin America Video Music Award, and an MTV Video Music Award. \"Hips Don't Lie\" reached the number one spot on charts in at least 55 countries including the U.S. Billboard Hot 100, becoming her first number one single in the country. It also broke the record for the most radio plays in a single week and the fastest selling digital download song in the United States. The song was eventually certified Triple platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), where it has sold over 3 million copies. It also topped the charts in Australia, Italy and the United Kingdom. Having sold over 16 million copies (10 million digital downloads and 6 million physical copies) by the turn of the decade, the track became one of the best-selling singles of the 21st century in physical singles and digital downloads combined.

The music was used with new lyrics in J-Pop singer Nami Tamaki's 2004 single \"Daitan ni Ikimashou Heart & Soul\". An alternate version was created for Radio Disney, replacing \"Snatch\" with \"Flash\", as the former is the name of an R-rated movie; and also substituting \"South Park\" with \"Star Wars\", as the former contains a lot of foul language that may be inappropriate for children (the key audience of the band)"@en ;

dbr:All_by_Myself	rdf:type	dbo:MusicalWork ;
	dbo:abstract	"\"All by Myself\" is a power ballad by American artist Eric Carmen released in 1975. The verse is based on the second movement (Adagio sostenuto) of Sergei Rachmaninoff's Piano Concerto No. 2 in C minor, Opus 18. The chorus is borrowed from the song \"Let's Pretend\", that Carmen had recorded with the Raspberries in 1972. The song was the first released on Carmen's first solo LP after leaving the power pop group the Raspberries and was released as the first single in December 1975, to great acclaim. It reached number 2 on the Billboard Hot 100, number 1 on Cash Box Top 100 Singles and number 3 in Canada. The single sold more than one million copies in the United States and was certified gold by the RIAA in April 1976. \"All By Myself\" was Carmen's first of eight U.S. Top 40 hits. In the UK, however, this was his only Top 40 success, peaking at number 12. In a 2006 poll for UK's Five programme Britain's Favourite Break-up Songs, Eric Carmen's version of this song was voted seventeenth. Carmen thought that Rachmaninoff\u2019s music was in the \u201Cpublic domain\u201D and no copyright existed on it. Subsequent to the release of the album, he was contacted by the Rachmaninoff estate and informed otherwise. An agreement was reached in which the estate would receive 12 percent of the royalties from \"All By Myself\" as well as from \"Never Gonna Fall in Love Again\", which was based on the third movement from Rachmaninoff's Symphony No. 2. Carmen has stated that he also incorporated part of another melody into this song. The melody was taken from his previous hit with the Raspberries, \"Let's Pretend.\" Carmen's original version has spawned numerous cover versions by such artists as Celine Dion, Frank Sinatra, Igudesman & Joo, Il Divo, and Only Men Aloud!. On his second solo LP, Boats Against the Current, Carmen had a subsequent Top 40 hit entitled \"She Did It\" which was the antithesis of \"All by Myself.\" It is a happy answer to the loneliness and lovelessness described in this song and its equally melancholy follow-up, \"Never Gonna Fall in Love Again.\" The Carmen version is used in the video introduction for Conan O'Brien's \"Legally Prohibited from Being Funny on Television Tour\", when an obese and bearded version of the talk show host struggles to cope with losing his job as host of Tonight Show. The Carmen version is also featured in the second season's episode 17 of the 90's popular sitcom Friends (set on Joey & Chandler's friendship), and a season 4 episode of the hit sitcom That 70's Show. It was also featured in the film Under Wraps. The version is used also in the film I nuovi mostri directed by Dino Risi, with Ornella Muti and Yorgo Voyagis."@en ;
