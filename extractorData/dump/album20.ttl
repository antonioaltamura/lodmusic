It was released on November 3, 1958 by Columbia Records, long after Cash's departure from Sun Records, and was re-issued in 2002 by Sony Music's Legacy imprint. The re-issue contains six bonus tracks and unedited versions of the songs. Legacy Records reissued the album in 180 gram vinyl for Record Store Day in November 23, 2012. The album features five tracks written by Cash and backing vocal performances by The Jordanaires (who at this time were also regulars on Elvis Presley's recording sessions for RCA Records). Overall, even though the album is only 29 minutes in length, it is considered one of Cash's most cohesive pieces. This is largely because his sessions with Columbia were completed over a two-month period. That is greatly reduced when compared to the year by year sessions by Sun Records. The Fabulous Johnny Cash was a successful debut on Columbia for Cash as it sold over half a million copies during its initial release. The album was recorded simultaneously with Hymns by Johnny Cash, released in 1959."@en ;

dbr:Accident_of_Birth	rdf:type	schema:MusicAlbum ;
	dbo:abstract	"Accident of Birth is a heavy metal album released in 1997 by Bruce Dickinson. It was published by Zomba Music. This is the second album made in collaboration with guitarist/producer Roy Z and is therefore much different from Bruce's previous Skunkworks album. He was also assisted by another former Iron Maiden member Adrian Smith and the two would later return to the band in early 1999. Thanks to the slightly bigger success of this album, Bruce would work with Roy Z in the future on his solo albums (including his latest, Tyranny of Souls). The cover art was done by Derek Riggs, best known for being the creator of Iron Maiden's mascot Eddie and the artwork on all Iron Maiden albums/singles/posters/tour brochures throughout 1980\u20131990 (and sporadically afterwards up until 2000's Brave New World other than one additional Eddie drawing for the cover of his book Run for Cover). Four versions of the album cover exist. The regular European release had Edison (as the jester was jokingly named as \"Eddie's Son\") bursting out of a man's stomach. The regular cover only shows the stomach, but the poster that came with the limited edition of the album made it clear that the stomach belongs to a man. This was deemed too explicit for the US market, where the album was released with a frontal view of the puppet. The 2005 re-release also has a different cover. The outer cardboard sleeve features the puppet nailed to a cross, while the cover art on the CD booklet itself is the one showing the jester bursting out of a man's stomach. The extended edition of the album features the same cover as the original, but re-scaled so as to make the man visible."@en ;

It was rumored that the themes of trust and betrayal, particularly certain lyrics from the songs \"A Minor Variation\" and \"The Great Wall of China\", stem from Joel's legal disputes with his former manager and ex-brother-in-law, Frank Weber, who reportedly embezzled millions of dollars from Joel and used dubious accounting practices to cover it up.

	dbo:abstract	"Adventures of the O.C. Supertones is the first album released by The O.C. Supertones. Its lyrical content is mostly simple and spiritual, similar to worship music. Cornerstone reviewer Don Hill stated that its simplicity was similar to that of the song \"Father Abraham\", designed to \"draw you out of yourself and into the presence of God like a small child.\" Some exceptions are \"Blood Washed Pilgrim\" which contains direct theology, and \"Found\" which references Saul's conversion to explain the purpose of the band. In the words of the band this is \"Preach the Gospel, reach your heart, and ska, ska, ska, ska!\" \"OC Supertones\" continues the explanations, stating their stance on the church and some of the band's background. Musically the album contains simple guitar supported by horns, with splashes of reggae, alternative rock, and rap. The latter elements would become more prevalent later in the band's later releases. The album's first track, in its intro, features a distinct similarity to Metallica's version of the Diamond Head (band) track Am I Evil? released on their 1980 debut album Lightning to the Nations The dialogue introduction for \"Found\" is from Back to the Future, when Doc Brown realizes the Libyans have found him. Production of the album took about ten days in the studio."@en ;

The album includes rarities and alternative tracks from the final two years of the band's career, ranging from the initial sessions for The Beatles (also known as The White Album) to the last sessions for Let It Be and Abbey Road in 1969 and early 1970. Following \"Free as a Bird\" in Anthology 1 and \"Real Love\" in Anthology 2, a third John Lennon solo demo entitled \"Now and Then\" was to be reworked by the three surviving members of The Beatles for Anthology 3. However, it was shelved due to complications and sound quality issues involving Lennon's recording. In its place is \"A Beginning\", an orchestral instrumental track initially intended for The White Album. \"A Beginning\" was composed by producer George Martin and intended to be the intro track to the Ringo Starr penned \"Don't Pass Me By\". Similar to the previous Anthology albums, the cover image painted by Klaus Voorman features a collage of Beatles-related imagery designed to appear as a wall of peeling posters and album covers."@en ;

The price of the bootleg was 28 pounds United Kingdom, and the sound quality was said to be \"appalling.\" The recordings on B'Boom are taken from soundboard mixes. However, the album was issued by DGM in something of a hurry to counter the Italian bootleg and they transplanted the line-up and instrument credits directly from the THRAK album. As a result of this, the credit of \"Mellotron\" by Robert Fripp is an error - although there is Mellotron on THRAK, there is none on B'Boom, nor was one used on this Argentinian tour."@en ;

Work on the album began in 2000, after Smith and Orzabal ended their longstanding feud. The album was originally due for release in 2003 on the Arista label, but personnel changes in the label's management (namely the departure of L.A. Reid who had signed the duo) led to the band breaking ties with the label before any music was released. The album eventually surfaced in the US in 2004 when it was released on the New Door label (a subsidiary of Universal Music), and in the UK in 2005 on the British independent label Gut Records.

It went multi-platinum and contained the songs that made the band an icon of the 1970s rock era. Some of the tracks were significantly edited from their original versions. The single version of \"Same Old Song and Dance\" was used, and was edited down almost a full minute. It also contained an alternate lyric which wasn't heard on Get Your Wings. The original lyric was \"Gotcha with the cocaine, found with your gun.\" The alternate lyric, included on the compilation, was \"You shady lookin' loser, you played with my gun.\" \"Sweet Emotion\" also used the single version; it begins with the first chorus, cutting out the now famous talk box intro and the coda was replaced with a repeating chorus and fades out. \"Kings and Queens\" was also edited down, cutting the intro and certain other parts. \"Walk This Way\" was edited slightly, chanting the first chorus once instead of twice. The other remaining tracks were kept intact. In 2004, a slightly revised version, Greatest Hits 1973\u20131988, was released, with the ten tracks in their edited versions retained, with five additional songs from the same era added, plus the 1991 version of \"Sweet Emotion\" and a live version of \"One Way Street\".

After a break in group activity in 1984 for each member to continue with their solo projects, Invisible Touch was recorded following the commercial success of Phil Collins's third solo album, No Jacket Required, and its supporting tour which had increased his popularity as a solo artist. The album was written entirely through group improvisations; no material developed prior to recording was used. Electronic drums and synthesizers are used extensively. Invisible Touch remains the best-selling studio release from Genesis, with over 6 million copies sold in the U.S. alone. It became the band's fourth consecutive album to top the UK charts and peaked at No. 3 in the U.S. It spawned five top five singles on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 chart, \"Invisible Touch\", \"Throwing It All Away\", \"Land of Confusion\", \"In Too Deep\", and \"Tonight, Tonight, Tonight\", with \"Invisible Touch\" reaching the top spot, the only Genesis single to do so. The album received mixed reviews on its release and retrospectively; several reviews, both positive and negative, have observed its similarity to Collins's solo records and their commercial pop sound. Genesis toured Invisible Touch from 1986 to 1987, which ended with a record four sold out shows at Wembley Stadium. The album was reissued with a new stereo and 5.1 surround sound mix in 2007."@en ;

After completing the album, the duo in Leftfield initially were not happy with it. On its release, the album was well received from the British press with positive reviews from the NME and Q. The album was nominated for the Mercury Prize in 1995 but lost to Portishead. Leftism sold well and was released months later in the United States.

A fourth single, \"Safe In the Arms of Love\", was released in Europe in 1992 but failed to chart. \"Temptation\" was set to become the final single[citation needed] but was never officially released. A concert tour to promote the album visited over 200 cities.[citation needed] Building upon such previous efforts as \"Toy Soldiers\", the album tackled serious topics lyrically. \"Broken Heart\" is about crack babies; \"Pride and Prejudice\" deals with racism and homophobia. The Spanglish track \"Mi Tierra\", which features a guest vocal performance by Celia Cruz, is a lament of a Cuban-American's inability to visit her homeland. The four Prince songs (tracks 1, 2, 3 and 10) on the album were recorded by him (the original versions have been circulating on several bootlegs) and then sent to Martika to overdub. Three of those songs, however, were based on a lyrics notebook Martika had given Prince for inspiration."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Sex, Love and Rock 'n' Roll is the sixth album by American punk rock band Social Distortion. It is their first studio album in eight years, since the release of White Light, White Heat, White Trash in 1996, the longest gap between Social Distortion's studio albums to date. The album was originally scheduled to be released in the fall of 2000, but was not yet completed, and it was officially released on September 28, 2004. A great deal of the album is a musical eulogy to former guitarist Dennis Danell, who died in 2000. The album's opening track, \"Reach for the Sky\", was released in late 2004 and became one of Social Distortion's biggest hits. Social Distortion could not release a follow-up to White Light, White Heat, White Trash partly because of their various other activities, most obviously those of frontman Mike Ness. He released two solo albums in 1999, one with original material (Cheating at Solitaire) and one with song covers (Under the Influences). Touring behind these projects, and matters pertaining to Danell's death, set Sex, Love and Rock 'n' Roll aside for a number of years before finally being completed in 2004. Sex, Love and Rock 'n' Roll was the first time since Social Distortion's 1990 self-titled album that Ness had collaborated with another songwriter. It was also the band's first album not to include a cover song since their 1983 debut album Mommy's Little Monster."@en ;

It was Harrison's first album release on his Dark Horse record label, the worldwide distribution for which changed from A&M Records to Warner Bros. as a result of his late delivery of the album's master tapes. Among other misfortunes affecting its creation, Harrison was waylaid with hepatitis midway through recording, and the copyright infringement suit regarding his 1970\u201371 hit song \"My Sweet Lord\" was decided in favour of the plaintiff, Bright Tunes Music. The album contains the hit singles \"This Song\" \u2013 Harrison's satire on that court case and the notion of plagiarism in pop music \u2013 and \"Crackerbox Palace\". Despite the problems associated with the album, many music critics recognised Thirty Three & 1/3 as a return to form for Harrison after his poorly received work during 1974\u201375, and considered it his strongest collection of songs since 1970's acclaimed All Things Must Pass. Harrison recorded Thirty Three & 1/3 at his Friar Park home studio, with production assistance from Tom Scott. Other musicians on the recording include Billy Preston, Gary Wright, Willie Weeks, David Foster and Alvin Taylor. Harrison undertook extensive promotion for the album, which included producing comedy-themed video clips for three of the songs, two of which were directed by Monty Python member Eric Idle, and making a number of radio and television appearances. Among the latter was a live performance with singer-songwriter Paul Simon on NBC-TV's Saturday Night Live. The album was remastered in 2004 as part of the Dark Horse Years 1976\u20131992 reissues following Harrison's death in 2001."@en ;

The album was released in April 2008, and is a collection of live recordings from various nights on the artist's solo tour in early 2006. It includes stripped down versions of songs by the Decemberists, a song that dates back to Meloy's college band Tarkio (\"Devil's Elbow\"), live banter and covers of The Smiths, R.E.M., Pink Floyd, Fleetwood Mac, and Shirley Collins. It includes two previously unreleased songs, \"Dracula's Daughter\" and \"Wonder\", the latter of which makes reference to Meloy's first--and recently at the time--born son. The arrangements are simply Meloy's voice and guitar throughout. Some reviewers have noted problems with Meloy's guitar during the recording and one refers to the resulting sound quality as \"disappointing.\" Meloy says the experience of playing Decemberists' songs without the full band was \"liberating,\" at least initially: \"...I can kind of start and stop songs, I can screw up without throwing everybody off, I can talk as much as I like without worrying about people getting antsy to move on to the next song. I guess those are the more obvious differences. But then it always gets a little lonely after I\u2019ve done a handful of shows. I\u2019m sure by the end of this tour I\u2019ll be ready to get everybody on stage again with me.\" Meloy supported the release with another solo tour during April and May 2008.

The LP includes multiple early gospel recordings by Jones on Starday. The album was released on January 20, 1959, and recorded from 1956-1958, listing Jones' first gospel recordings. The album, however, wasn't received well, and did not chart, due in large part to the lackluster sound of Starday and Mercury Records during the 50's. The album was also Jones' debut album as a Mercury artist."@en ;

In addition, the song \"Cosmic Slop\" shares its name with a 1973 Funkadelic album. In 2010, Redman told Vibe Magazine that he never performed any songs from Dare Iz A Darkside in recent years - primarily due to the album being made during one of the dark times in his life."@en ;

Eagles Live was mixed by Glenn Frey and Don Henley on opposite coasts, as the two decided they could not stand to be in the same state, let alone the same studio, and as producer Bill Szymczyk put it, the record's three-part harmonies were fixed \"courtesy of Federal Express.\" The 1983 Rolling Stone Record Guide said it is \"perhaps the most heavily overdubbed [live album] in history.\" \"Seven Bridges Road\" was released as a single and would become a top 40 hit.

It's the band's fifth studio album overall, and second effort after changing its name from End of a Year to Self Defense Family. The album was released on June 30, 2015 through Deathwish Inc. For Heaven Is Earth, Self Defense Family recorded two tracks with four producers in four different cities on the East Coast of the United States for a total of eight songs. The band recorded with Kurt Ballou of Converge at GodCity Studios in Salem, Massachusetts; with former Orchid and Ampere member Will Killingsworth at Dead Air Studio in Ahmerst, Massachusetts; with Jon Low, who previously worked with Kurt Vile and The National, at Miner Street Recordings in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; and with Mark Miller, who previously worked with Dinosaur Jr. and Garth Brooks, at Sone Lab in East Hampton, Massachusetts. A limited edition 7\" single for the Heaven Is Earth's second track \"Talia\" accompanied by the B-side track \"Taxying,\" which was an outtake from the album's sessions, was released for Record Store Day 2015 with cover art nearly identical to that of its parent album, with the exception of the person in the center of the image being absent. A release for the music video for \"Talia\" coincided with the album's official announcement date of May 4, 2015. On the subject of the video, Self Defense Family vocalist Patrick Kindlon said: \"The video is not so much inspired by but directly ripped off from the Talk Talk 'It's My Life' music video \u2014 the best music video in human history. Eventually, we'll do one of those 'band playing in a warehouse' videos. But until then, you get stock footage of animals.\" On June 2, Self Defense Family released a music video for the album's closing track, \"Dave Sim.\""@en ;

It was released in the United States in two formats: a single CD containing all four tracks (released November 22, 2005) and a box set of four 12\" vinyl records (released December 6, 2005) with one track each. The remixes were originally released as B-sides to the band's UK-only single, \"C'mere\" on March 30, 2006 across three different formats. Until these tracks were released on a bonus disc coupled with the special edition re-release of Antics, the only ways fans in the United States could hear these remixes were by importing the singles from the UK or downloading them via a peer-to-peer client. Interpol Remix allows fans who already purchased Antics the chance to own the remixes without buying the album again.

The term \u201DKansuigyo\", which means opposite of \"Nettaigyo\" (\u71B1\u5E2F\u9B5A tropical fish), is Nakajima's neologism. Five months before the album came out, she produced a hit single \"Bad Girl (Akujo)\", which became her first chart topper since \"Wakareuta (The Parting Song)\" in 1977. The song became one of the most commercially successful single of that year, reaching the top-10 on the year-end chart of 1982. In the following year, Sylvie Vartan covered the song in French-translated lyrics on her Danse ta vie album, under the alternative title \"Ta vie de chien\". Kansuigyo begin with another interpretation of above-mentioned successful song, which features more rock-oriented arrangement and her listless vocals. Rest of the album mainly consists of the ballads that used strings effectively . \"Utahime (Diva)\", 8-minute long track included at the end of the album has been one of her fan favorites and also included on her later \"greatest hits\". Lyrics of \"Keisha (The Incline)\", the song which described melancholy of a solitary elderly woman who are walking on steep slope, was evaluated literarily and had been listed in a textbook on the Japanese language around the 1990s. When Nakajima recorded the Ima no Kimochi album that were constituted by new interpretations of the past materials in 2004, those two songs were picked out from Kansuigyo. The album spent the number-one spot on the Japanese Oricon chart for six week, and became the country's best-selling LP of that year. It has also been her album that gained biggest commercial success to date, eventually selling about 770,000 units."@en ;

When Kurt Cobain died in 1994 the video lay unfinished so remaining Nirvana band members Dave Grohl and Krist Novoselic stepped in to finish it. The video includes live performances as well as interviews with the band. Amongst the live performances is a \"disturbing\" performance of \"Love Buzz\" in which Cobain gets into a fight with an over aggressive bouncer. Most of the live footage is from 1991 and 1992, with home video footage dating back to late-1990. The latest footage is from January 23, 1993 at the Hollywood Rock Festival in Brazil. A rough outline of the video appears in the book \"Journals\", a published book of Kurt Cobain's journals."@en ;

I had always wanted to do this one day; singing other people's songs brings something out of you and your voice that isn't perhaps where you would have gone vocally with your own material.\" She added: \"It stretches you. As it happened Mike and I did write a couple of new ones, but the general idea was to find songs by great writers such as Ron Sexsmith ('Gold In Them Hills') and a favourite song of mine, originally recorded by Bonnie Raitt ('Too Long At The Fair') plus some more well-known ones like Keeping The Dream Alive.\" The lead single, \"Better Than a Dream\", and the track \"Walls of the World\" were both originally recorded by Melua's longtime collaborator Mike Batt, for the TV series The Dreamstone and his 1977 solo album Schizophonia respectively. The record serves as the follow-up to Melua's 2010 album The House, which reached number four on the UK album chart. Musicperk.com rated the album 9/10. A \"Special Bonus Edition\" of the album has also been released.

So Wrong/You're Stronger Than Me contained four songs, two on each side of the record that it was released on. The first two songs on side one were new: \"So Wrong\" and \"You're Stronger Than Me.\" \"So Wrong\" was the third single Cline released in 1962, peaking at #14 on the Billboard Country Chart, and its flip side was \"You're Stronger Than Me\" (the re-recorded version). Because the single was not released on any album, this EP served as the source of obtaining the single and its B-side. On side two, two songs from Cline's 1962 album, Sentimentally Yours, were put on the EP: \"Heartaches\" and \"Your Cheatin' Heart.\" This would be Cline's last EP collection that would be released in her lifetime, as she would be killed in a plane crash less than a year later in March 1963. However, several other EP's would be released following her death. The cover photo for So Wrong/You're Stronger Than Me was taken by photographer, Hal Buksbaum. Although not released as a single, \"You're Stronger Than Me\" was also covered by George Strait on his 2000 album titled George Strait."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"The Altar and the Door is the third studio album by American Christian rock band Casting Crowns, released on August 28, 2007 on Beach Street Records and Reunion Records. Produced by Mark A. Miller, the album was inspired by lead singer Mark Hall's experience looking at the MySpace pages of his youth ministry students. The album's main theme is the difference between how Christians feel in church and the compromises they make outside of it. Its musical tone, which Hall says is different and more progressive, incorporates more of a rock sound than their previous, more polished studio efforts. The Altar and the Door received positive to mixed reviews from critics upon its release. Particular praise was given to the lyrics and the album's overall concept, but some critics felt the album's sound was mediocre and uninventive. The album received the award for Pop/Contemporary Album of the Year at the 39th GMA Dove Awards. It sold 129,000 copies in its first week, a record for a Christian album with no secular media support, enabling a debut at number one on the Billboard Christian Albums chart and number two on the Billboard 200 and Digital Albums charts, only blocked on the latter charts by the soundtrack for High School Musical 2. It later topped the Catalog Albums chart in 2010. The 18th best-selling Christian album of the 2000s, The Altar and the Door has sold 1.2 million copies and has been certified Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). The lead single from The Altar and the Door, \"East to West\", was one of the most successful Christian singles of the 2000s, spending a total of 19 weeks atop the Billboard Christian Songs chart and peaking at twenty-five on the Bubbling Under Hot 100 Singles chart. While not as successful as \"East to West\", follow-up singles \"Every Man\" and \"Slow Fade\" were both top five hits on the Christian Songs chart."@en ;

The singles released from the album were \"All You Pretty Girls\" (released 3 September 1984 and reached No. 55 on the UK Singles Chart), \"This World Over\" (released 29 October 1984) and \"Wake Up\" (released 28 January 1985). The album reached No. 38 on the UK Albums Chart, and No. 181 on the U.S. Billboard 200. The band made a big-budget promotional video for \"All You Pretty Girls\", and appeared on the BBC-TV programme Saturday Superstore with lip-synch performances of \"This World Over\" and \"All You Pretty Girls\". The seventh track, \"I Bought Myself a Liarbird\" is about their former manager, Ian Reid. The fourth track, \"Seagulls Screaming Kiss Her, Kiss Her\" was written by Partridge on the band's mellotron. It inspired the name of the Japanese indie rock band, Seagull Screaming Kiss Her Kiss Her."@en ;

It was the band's second - and last - album for the Too Pure label, and the last to feature original members Richard Adderley, Patrick Pulzer, Colin Williams and George Wright. Despite excellent reviews and extensive touring in support of the album, sales were disappointing. This led in part to the band being dropped by their record label in 1999. \"Steamin'\" and \"Lolita Elle\" were released as singles in the UK and Europe, but failed to chart or to pick up significant airplay."@en ;

The concert also included performances from artist Ian Johnstone, \u201Cwelcoming everyone as Mr. Ark Todd in a static dance under a levitating moon, and parting with a pillar, on the skeleton legs of a horse, pale and naked as nature intended. The two pieces were accompanied by piano prepared by Daniel and the sound of a sleeping beast from Kris' pad.\u201D Until recently Ulver had remained exclusively within the studio. This changed in May 2009 when the band accepted an invitation to appear at the Norwegian Festival of Literature. The success of this gig lead to them embarking on a string of other live performances in 2009 and 2010, selling out prestigious venues such as the Queen Elizabeth Hall in London, Volksb\u00FChne in Berlin and La Cigale in Paris before they returned to their homeland for their performance at The Norwegian Opera House.

dbr:A_Pocket_Full_of_Miracles	rdf:type	schema:MusicAlbum ;
	dbo:abstract	"A Pocket Full Of Miracles (TS306) is a 1970 album by Motown Records R&B group The Miracles,(AKA \"Smokey Robinson & The Miracles\") issued on its Tamla subsidiary label, one of three albums the group released that year. This album charted at #56 on the Billboard pop albums chart, and reached the top ten of the magazine's R&B albums chart, peaking at #10. It was released on September 30 of that year. Hit singles on the album included \"Point It Out\" and the topical Ashford & Simpson written-and-produced song \"Who's Gonna Take The Blame\", a sad, dark song about a girl that is turned out as a prostitute (unusually serious lyric content for The Miracles). Also included is the charting flip side \"Darling Dear\", B-side of \"Point It Out\", which reached # 100 on the Billboard pop chart, and spawned a cover version by The Jackson Five. The album's name takes its title from the 1961 Frank Capra comedy film Pocketful of Miracles. However, that is where the similarities end. Its cover depicts four of The Miracles, Smokey Robinson, Bobby Rogers, Pete Moore,and Ronnie White, sitting inside a huge cartoon \"pocket\", (thus the name \"Pocket Full Of Miracles\").Other original songs in the collection included \"Flower Girl\", the powerful potential hit \"Backfire\" (that was not released as a single), and the melancholy \"The Reel Of Time\". Miracles members Marv Tarplin and Claudette Robinson are featured on the songs \"You've Got The Love I Need\" (a ballad with rock overtones) and \"Don't Take It So Hard\", respectively. However, they are not featured on the album's cover (apparently because the \"pocket\" would then have too many Miracles). Covers include versions of Simon and Garfunkel's \"Bridge over Troubled Water\", Chuck Jackson and Maxine Brown's \"Something You Got\", included in a medley with The Beatles' \"Something\", and Smokey's composition for The Temptations, \"Get Ready\", which features an arrangement borrowed from the Cream hit \"Sunshine of Your Love\". Motown staff songwriters contributing to this project included Ashford & Simpson, William \"Mickey\" Stevenson, H. Gordy, R Gordy, R. Jones, and Miracles members Smokey Robinson, Pete Moore, and Marv Tarplin. This album, like several of The Miracles' post-1969 albums, has never been released in the CD format. It was re-released in edited form a few years later, by the defunct independent label Pickwick International, under license from Motown, with a different cover, and the modified name Pocketful."@en ;

The Robert mentioned in \"Drowning In The Days\" (as well as \"Big Brown Eyes\") is Miller's boyhood friend, Robert Jenkins. \"Miss Molly\" recalls Miller and Hammond's previous work with bluegrass band, Killbilly, with \"Doreen\" referring to a memorable fan of that band and referencing New York City for the first of many times. \"4 Leaf Clover\" was re-recorded as \"Four Leaf Clover\" with Exene Cervenka for the band's 1997 album, Too Far To Care. Live favorite, \"Wish The Worst\", is the only Old 97's song with lead guitar played by someone other than Ken Bethea. \"Mama Tried\" is a Merle Haggard standard and is a favorite live song for bassist, Hammond. \"Tupelo County Jail\" is a hidden track, playing after a long pause at the end of the album."@en ;

Sonically, this album does continue to develop a very natural-sounding instrumentation that began to appear with Ancient Journeys, though it uses them to create a more mysterious vibe than that of the previous album.

Like Mandrell's previous album, Midnight Angel was not as successful as her other albums to come. However, the album set the stage for her future recordings under the label. This album only released one single, \"Midnight Angel\". The song was not a Top 10 hit, peaking in the Top 20 instead. The album also peaked at #24 on the Top Country Albums chart. With her second album under ABC/dot, her songs got sexier, including the songs, \"Pillow Pleasure\", \"Slippin' Around Again\", and the pop-tinged \"I Never Said I Love You.\" The album included a song that would be released as a single on the next album, \"Married But Not to Each Other.\""@en ;

Instead, it tells a fictional, medieval-themed story written by Haggard's songwriter Asis Nasseri. The album includes a cover version of the song \"Hijo de la Luna\" (Son of the Moon), originally written by Jos\u00E9 Mar\u00EDa Cano and performed by his own band, Spanish Pop group Mecano. However, his authorship of the song is not acknowledged in the CD's booklet, instead being referred to as \"Traditional\" music and lyrics. The album was released on August 29, 2008. It peaked at positions 37 in the German Media Control Charts and 89 in the Swiss Music Charts."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"The Pale Emperor is the ninth studio album by American rock band Marilyn Manson. It was released on January 15, 2015 through Marilyn Manson's own Hell, etc. label, with distribution handled in the US by Loma Vista Recordings, Canada by Dine Alone Records, Japan by Victor Entertainment and internationally by Cooking Vinyl. The album was released in standard and deluxe editions on CD and 2\u00D7LP vinyl, as well as a \"Definitive Box\" set. The standard version of the album contains ten tracks, while the deluxe edition includes three acoustic versions as bonus tracks. Produced by Manson and newcomer Tyler Bates, who met through their mutual involvement in the TV series Californication, The Pale Emperor eschews the band's usual industrial rock genre in favor of a more sparse, blues-influenced sound. The album also features drummer Gil Sharone, formerly of The Dillinger Escape Plan, and is the first release since his return in 2008 to not feature writing and performance contributions from bassist Twiggy. The album is dedicated to Manson's mother, who died during its production after an eight-year battle with Alzheimer's disease and dementia. The album was released to generally positive reviews from contemporary music critics, with several writers referring to it as his best album in over a decade, and was ranked by several publications as one of the best albums of 2015. The album was also a commercial success, debuting at number eight on the Billboard 200 with the band's highest opening week sales since Eat Me, Drink Me (2007). It also topped the national albums chart in Switzerland, as well as Billboard's Top Hard Rock Albums chart. It went on to peak within the top ten in fifteen other territories. It spawned three official singles, \"Third Day of a Seven Day Binge\", \"Cupid Carries a Gun\" and \"Deep Six\", with the latter going on to become the band's highest-peaking single ever on Billboard's Mainstream Rock Chart; while \"The Mephistopheles of Los Angeles\" and \"The Devil Beneath My Feet\" have been released as promotional singles. The album is being supported by The Hell Not Hallelujah Tour, which was interspersed by two co-headlining tours, The End Times with The Smashing Pumpkins, and a summer 2016 co-headlining tour with Slipknot."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"The Shade of Poison Trees is the fifth studio album recorded by the band Dashboard Confessional. The album in its entirety was posted on the band's MySpace page on September 28, 2007, and it was released on October 2, 2007 on Vagrant Records. This album was very much kept a secret, with no news of its development leaking out. The official Vagrant announcement, released on August 16, 2007, stated that The Shade of Poison Trees has been recorded over 10 days in Florida with producer Don Gilmore, who also takes credit for the production of Dashboard Confessional's previous album, Dusk and Summer. The Shade of Poison Trees is heralded as a return to form, so to speak, breaking away from the electric, full band sound of their previous two albums and returning to the acoustic sound that Carrabba was previously known for. However, the album is unmistakably more mature, as the songs sound similar to their more recent work, yet without the heavily produced style. The album comes a little over a year after the release of Dusk and Summer. \"Thick as Thieves\" was released as the first single off the album in August 2007. On August 22, 2007, the band posted \"Little Bombs\" on their MySpace page. On September 25, the band added \"Keep Watch for the Mines\" to their MySpace page; later that evening, the album leaked on the boards of the band's official website. As of September 26, 2007, the album leaked onto the Internet. \"These Bones\" was Dashboard Confessional's second single off the album and was released December 3, 2007. Following its release, The Shade of Poison Trees debuted at number 18 on the U.S. Billboard 200 chart, selling about 48,000 copies in its first week."@en ;

Germany, Italy and Spain were the three members of the \"Big Five\" that managed to rank within the top 10, finishing in 8th, 9th and 10th places respectively. The lead-up to the contest was met with political concerns and protests surrounding the host country, including its human rights record and allegations by advocacy groups that Baku was carrying out forced evictions in the construction of the contest's venue, along with objections to the contest's presence by Iranian officials\u2014who felt that the event was anti-Islamic because it was, according to them, a \"gay parade\"."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"A Nod's As Good As a Wink... to a Blind Horse was the third album by British rock group Faces, and their second album of 1971. It was their most successful album, peaking at #6 in the US, and reaching #2 in the UK. It contains their biggest hit, the rollicking \"Stay with Me\" (#6 in the UK, #17 in the US), and the album itself would be certified gold by the RIAA in 1972. The original issue of the album came with a poster consisting of a picture collage, including images of pills and pharmaceutical capsules, as well as photos apparently taken on tour of band and crew members reveling with naked groupies in hotel rooms. Within weeks of release, the record company had second thoughts and re-issued the album without the poster, making original copies with the poster into collectors' items. On 28 August 2015, the album was reissued in a remastered and expanded form, with the bonus tracks being two songs from a previously unreleased BBC session. The new vinyl reissue even replicated the poster included with the first-pressing vinyl release."@en ;

Siberry was commenting on the prevalence of this type of offensive language on the streets of a big city. \"Something About Trains\" also appeared (as \"This Old Earth\") on The Top of His Head, the soundtrack to Peter Mettler's film The Top of His Head; the song was a Genie Award nominee for Best Original Song at the 11th Genie Awards in 1990.

	dbo:abstract	"Captured Live at the Forum is the third album by American rock band Three Dog Night, released in 1969 (see 1969 in music). The album was recorded at The Forum in Los Angeles, CA. Original pressings of the album bore the headline \"In front of an audience over 18,000 on September 12, 1969 in Los Angeles, Three Dog Night was Captured Live at the Forum.\" Future pressings would remove the 12 September date, however, and lead singer Chuck Negron's autobiography Three Dog Nightmare would subsequently list the concert's performance date as 14 July 1969. According to Three Dog Nightmare, Three Dog Night opened this show in support of Steppenwolf, who were recording various shows on their 1969-70 tour for an upcoming live album (Steppenwolf Live, released 1970). Steppenwolf and Three Dog Night both recorded for the ABC/Dunhill label and shared the same production team, so it was decided to record Three Dog Night on this occasion as well, despite the band's having only released two albums to date. The choice was a fruitful one, as Captured Live at the Forum reached #6 on the Billboard album chart. All the songs featured on Captured Live at the Forum were previously issued in studio versions by Three Dog Night; specifically, \"Feelin' Alright\", \"Eli's Coming\", and \"Easy to Be Hard\" were included on the band's second album Suitable for Framing, and the remainder on their eponymous first album."@en ;

Musically, the album consisted of dance style tracks as well as ballads, and saw Aguilera performing in Spanish language songs. The record was conceived to showcase Aguilera's vocals in an effort to reach out to record labels, a venture which actually backfired after the recordings were not very well received among critics.

With Scary Monsters, however, Bowie achieved what biographer David Buckley called \"the perfect balance\"; as well as earning critical acclaim, the album peaked at No. 1 in the UK and restored Bowie's commercial standing in the US. Although the album is commonly referred to as Scary Monsters (And Super Creeps), in keeping with the song title, and the album title as written on the front and back covers of the LP is Scary Monsters . . . . . and Super Creeps, the album is identified simply as Scary Monsters on the LP spine and disc label."@en ;

The album was a turn of direction of sorts, with most of the songs stepping back from their progressive rock sound, employing synthesised dance beats and rhythms. Chief songwriter Rick Davies later recalled, \"Free As A Bird was an experiment to try and be modern and build it up with computers and drum machines and have people come in one by one, which makes you lose the band spirit a little bit.\" The album was the first Supertramp album to feature contributions from guitarist/vocalist Mark Hart. He would later become a full-fledged member of the group. Despite the fact that \"I'm Beggin' You\" was a club chart-topping hit and Free as a Bird's title cut was a minor hit, the album did not do well peaking at No. 101, making it the first Supertramp album since 1971's Indelibly Stamped not to crack Billboard's Top 100 on the album charts. The band disbanded after the tour in support of the album and would not reconvene until 1997. They did so without bassist Dougie Thomson."@en ;

It contains a number of rarities and live tracks as a thank you to fans; the band would break up at the end of 2003. When it was announced that this album would be made, the band asked fans to call a provided phone number and leave suggestions for what the album should contain. The original album name was \"Cheeses of Nazareth\", but the band decided it might be considered sacrilegious, so it was shortened to \"Cheeses...\". The title is based on a joke circulating on the Internet with a punchline of Cheeses of Nazareth. The album's interior contains a map of the U.S. showing a reference to the cheeses of Nazareth, Pennsylvania. The album mainly appealed to the group's dedicated fan base. However, it managed to chart on both the Billboard heatseekers and contemporary Christian chart in the US."@en ;

Production for it was handled by the group and took place during 1990 to 1991 at Homeboy Studio, Power Play Studios, and Libra Digital in New York City. Recorded during the golden age of hip hop, Breaking Atoms is distinguished stylistically by its incorporation of jazz and soul music samples. The album has been highly regarded by music writers due mostly to its production, whose heavy and original use of sampling influenced hip hop producers for a considerable portion of the 1990s. The album has been widely regarded by writers and music critics as a significantly influential album and has been noted for debuting rapper Nas, who appears on the track \"Live at the Barbeque\". His contribution to the song was sampled on \"Genesis\", the intro track to his debut album Illmatic (1994). Breaking Atoms has been recognized as one of the most important records in hip hop history, and was out of print in the United States after the demise of Wild Pitch Records in 1997.

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Can\u0027t_Be_Tamed>	rdf:type	schema:MusicAlbum ;
	dbo:abstract	"Can't Be Tamed is the third studio album by American singer Miley Cyrus. It was released on June 18, 2010, by Hollywood Records; it would become her final album with the label after signing with RCA Records in 2013. Cyrus wrote the project in 2009, while travelling internationally for her Wonder World Tour, and recorded it in 2010. Described by Cyrus as a \"good [record] to blast in your car\", Can't Be Tamed represents a musical departure from her earlier work, which she had grown to feel uninspired by. As executive producers, Tish Cyrus and Jason Morey enlisted partners including Devrim Karaoglu, Marek Pompetzki, Rock Mafia, and John Shanks to achieve Cyrus' desired new sound. Their efforts resulted in a primarily dance-pop record, which Cyrus' record label acknowledged differed from the original plans for the project. Its lyrical themes revolve largely around breaking free of constraints and expectations, which are largely mentioned in the context of romantic relationships. Upon its release, Can't Be Tamed received generally mixed reviews from music critics, who were ambivalent towards perceived lack of musical focus and a failure to fully establish Cyrus' maturing public image; additional criticism was placed on her vocals sounding over-processed and lacking emotional depth. It debuted at number three on the U.S. Billboard 200 with first-week sales of 100,000 copies. It is Cyrus' lowest-peaking and lowest-selling record in the United States. The album has sold 350,000 copies in the country. Can't Be Tamed charted moderately on record charts in internationally, reaching the top-ten in countries including Australia, Canada, and the United Kingdom. Two singles were released from Can't Be Tamed. Its title track \"Can't Be Tamed\" was released on May 14, 2010, and peaked at number eight on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100, and performed moderately worldwide. Follow-up single \"Who Owns My Heart\" was released October 22, 2010 and was only released in selected European countries, failing to chart on the Billboard Hot 100 and charting poorly on European singles chart. Promotional efforts for Can't Be Tamed began to associate Cyrus with an increasingly provocative image, an effort continued with her fourth studio album Bangerz (2013). The record was primarily promoted through a series of television appearances and Cyrus' headlining Gypsy Heart Tour in 2011. Can't Be Tamed is Cyrus first album to not be certified platinum in the US. The album has sold 1 million copies worldwide."@en ;

The album was her first release since her breakdown following the release of her film Glitter (2001) and its accompanying soundtrack album, both of which were critical and commercial failures from the previous year. Critics described Charmbracelet as one of her most personal records, following 1997's Butterfly, Throughout the project, Carey collaborated with several songwriters and producers, including Jermaine Dupri, Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis, 7 Aurelius and Dre & Vidal. According to Carey, love is the album's main theme, and the songs combine introspective and personal themes with celebration and fun. The album contains a mixture of pop ballads and R&B beats, and the songs incorporate elements of other genres, such as gospel and soul. Compared to Glitter, which featured a variety of sampled melodies from the 1980s, Charmbracelet has a more softer hip hop and R&B sound to it. Cam'ron, Jay-Z and Freeway also appear on the album. Charmbracelet debuted at number three on the US Billboard 200 chart, and sold 241,000 copies in its first week. The album peaked within the top 40 in seven countries, and attained top ten positions in Japan and Switzerland. Three singles were released to promote the album. The lead single, \"Through the Rain\" reached the top ten in Canada, Switzerland, Sweden and Italy and the United Kingdom.

	dbo:abstract	"Gillan's Inn is an album by Ian Gillan in celebration of his 40 years as a singer. The first release was a DualDisc composed of both a CD and a DVD side. The CD featured re-recorded tracks from all eras of Ian Gillan's singing career. In a recent interview Gillan observed that, despite the number of participants and guest appearances, this was the easiest project he ever put together.[citation needed] A \"Deluxe Tour Edition\" was released in 2007 containing bonus tracks and an expanded version of the DVD side of the original DualDisc release. The correct bonus tracks included on most version of the disc are live versions of \"Have Love Will Travel\" and \"Wasted Sunsets\", both recorded at the House of Blues in Anaheim on 14 September 2006 (the show which would later be released on the Live in Anaheim CD). There was, however, an error in the manufacturing at one of the plants, where an early version of the master tape was sent by mistake containing a previously unreleased cover version of Marvin Gaye's \"Can I Get a Witness?\" at track 16 and not including the live bonus tracks. The record label, Immergent, offered to send all owners of the incorrect CD a copy of the proper disc free of charge, and let them keep the original, which is now a collector's item. The CD booklet lists the live bonus tracks on all versions. The album cover depicts an iconic bar in Buffalo, New York called \"The Pink Flamingo\", also known as \"The Old Pink\". The album cover art was created by Don Keller. This edition also re-instates the new version of Deep Purple's \"Demon's Eye\" to the CD, which was previously only included on the DVD side of the DualDisc release."@en ;

The album produced the singles \"Nobody's Got It All\" which peaked at 55 on the country charts and \"You Ain't Hurt Nothin' Yet\", which peaked at 56. Also included on the album was a cover of Bruce Springsteen's 1982 song Atlantic City from his album Nebraska. According to Allmusic, Anderson's vocals are best utilized in the album on \"the ballads, which prominently feature steel guitar and fiddle in traditional country style.\" His voice is described as \"vulnerable, slightly wheezy tenor\" that is best suited for \"slow material.\" The reviewer states that some of the tracks are \"conservative reflections\" on life. Anderson's voice is compared by the reviewer to Levon Helm. The album was produced by Blake Chancey and Paul Worley, who were a popular production team at the end of the 1990s, most notable for their work with the Dixie Chicks. \"It Ain't Easy Being Me\" was previously recorded by Chris Knight on his self-titled album. \"The Big Revival\" was later recorded by Montgomery Gentry on Back When I Knew It All, which was also produced by Chancey.

	dbo:abstract	"Origo is the fourth full length album by Swedish progressive metal band Burst, released on October 17, 2005 by Relapse Records. Overall, it has received widespread critical acclaim, from magazines such as Kerrang! and Rock Sound.[citation needed] Aaron Burgess, writing for Alternative Press describes the album as \"a blistering epic, complete with keyboards, acoustic passages and female backing vocals in tow\". He continues to add that \"Burst sound ready to, well, burst out of obscurity and into the genre-shattering realm of fellow post-metal masters Isis, Neurosis and Cult Of Luna.\" Speaking on the album's sound, he states that \"[t]hough frontman Linus J\u00E4gerskog's shearing vocals are terminally locked on overdrive, the rest of Origo is a sweeping, time-shifting exploration of dynamics, moods and tonal color--and while \"beautiful\" isn't usually the sort of adjective we like to throw at a metal record, in this case, it's the rule, not the exception.\". The song \"Where the Wave Broke\" is about Mieszko Talarczyk, the leader of now defunct and fellow Swedish grindcore band Nasum, who died in the tsunami which hit Thailand on December 26, 2004.[citation needed] Jesper Liver\u00F6d was the bassist of Nasum for most of their career."@en ;

The two singles, \"Weak4\" and \"Crash Tactics\", were released on 18 and 30 March respectively.To promote the release of their album, the band organized a headlining European tour with the bands Nedry and Loops Haunt; beginning in the Netherlands and ending in Ireland, they have also hinted towards a future U.S. tour. The album was made available as a live stream on the band's Myspace page on the 19 April, one week ahead of its release. The album debuted at number 99 in the UK Albums Chart and number 7 in the UK independent albums chart. Musically, We Were Exploding Anyway has a stronger electronic sound, featuring more dance beats, electronic bass and drum tracks, and less complex guitar-driven patterns that distances the album from the band's earlier math rock/post-rock elements. In a review by The Line of Best Fit, \"...[the album] also sees them seemingly desperate to rid themselves of their characterless post-rock moniker as they delve well and truly into the more rhythmic qualities of dance music.\".

It was released on 27 November 2009 in Ireland and 30 November 2009 in the UK through S Records, RCA Records and Sony Music. Where We Are is the group's first album following a break from music in 2008. The album was preceded by the lead single \"What About Now\", a cover of the Daughtry song, and was released on 23 October 2009 as a digital download a day later as a CD single. The group collaborated with numerous notable producers for the album, notably Ryan Tedder of the pop rock band OneRepublic, Jim Jonsin, Greg Wells and Sam Watters, among others. Where We Are is also notably the first Westlife album not to have Steve Mac and Wayne Hector produce or write any of the songs. The album was met with unfavorable reviews, although it was still commercially successful, debuting at number two at the UK Albums Chart. Despite the high peak, it was the first Westlife album not to peak at number one since their 2004 album Allow Us to Be Frank peaked at number three."@en ;

Whereas Breaking Kayfabe used heavy beats and grime from the electronic genre for its overall sound, Afterparty Babies has a club-feel throughout with elements of house and tech house that go along with Cadence's autobiographical lyrics about inter-personal relationships in his hometown of Edmonton and the youth culture interacting with both the Internet and media in general. The album received a positive reception from critics, praising it for its experimentation of the electronic genre and its self-deprecating lyrics with pop culture references.

Between the Times and the Tide's sound was influenced by Joni Mitchell, Neil Young and Leonard Cohen, as well as contemporary artists such as Cat Power. The title of the album comes from a lyric in the song \"Xtina as I Knew Her\". Upon its release, Between the Times and the Times received positive critical acclaim and charted in four countries, including Belgium, France, Germany and the United States. Its two singles\u2014\"Off the Wall\" and \"Shouts\"\u2014were moderate critical successes but failed to chart. The album's release was followed by two tours of North America and Oceania from April to October 2012, which included appearances at various music festivals, including All Tomorrow's Parties I'll Be Your Mirror and the Melbourne International Arts Festival."@en ;

dbr:Channel_Orange	rdf:type	schema:MusicAlbum ;
	dbo:abstract	"Channel Orange (stylized as channel ORANGE) is the debut studio album by American recording artist Frank Ocean, released on July 10, 2012, by Def Jam Recordings. After releasing his 2011 mixtape Nostalgia, Ultra, Ocean began writing the album with creative partner Malay, who assisted him with its recording at EastWest Studio in Hollywood. Rather than rely on samples as he had with his mixtape, Ocean wanted to approach sound and song structure differently on Channel Orange. He titled the album as a reference to the neurological phenomenon grapheme\u2013color synesthesia and the color he perceived during the summer he first fell in love. Channel Orange has an unconventional musical style, film-inspired segue tracks, and songs that draw on electro-funk, pop-soul, jazz-funk, and psychedelic music. Ocean's songwriting touches on themes such as unrequited love, decadence, class, and drugs through the use of surrealistic imagery, conversational devices, and descriptive narratives depicting dark characters. His baritone singing on the album exhibits free-form flow and alternating falsetto and tenor registers. To prevent it from leaking onto the Internet, Ocean released the album digitally one week earlier than its publicly announced date. He promoted it with five singles, including his highest charting single \"Thinkin Bout You\", and a supporting tour in July 2012. Channel Orange debuted at number two on the Billboard 200 and sold 131,000 copies in its first week. It received widespread acclaim from critics and was named the best album of 2012 by numerous publications. As of September 2014, the album has sold 621,000 copies, according to Nielsen SoundScan."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"The Eurovision Song Contest 2014 was the 59th annual Eurovision Song Contest. The contest took place in Copenhagen, Denmark, following Emmelie de Forest's win in the 2013 contest in Sweden with the song \"Only Teardrops\". This was the third time that Denmark hosted the contest, the most recent previous occasion being in 2001. The two semi-finals took place on 6 May and 8 May 2014, and the final on 10 May 2014. The shows were presented by Lise R\u00F8nne, Nikolaj Koppel and Pilou Asb\u00E6k. The show organisers from Copenhagen all in all spent 112 million Danish kroner on the contest; three times more than what was expected and were furthermore highly accused of cases of nepotism within the organisation. The host broadcaster, DR, chose the B&W Hallerne as the host venue after considering several bids from cities and venues across Denmark. Thirty-seven countries participated; this includes the return of Poland after a two-year absence and Portugal after a one-year absence. Overall, there were two fewer countries competing compared to the previous year, making thirty-seven participants, the smallest number since 2006. Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus and Serbia announced their withdrawal from the 2014 Contest. San Marino and Montenegro both qualified for the final for the first time. The winner was Conchita Wurst with the song \"Rise Like a Phoenix\", written by Charley Mason, Joey Patulka, Ali Zuckowski, and Julian Maas for Austria. This was Austria's first win in the competition since 1966. Jokes made about Wurst had sparked controversy, whilst Russia were booed several times during the contest. The Netherlands and Sweden finished second and third respectively with the former achieving their best result since their victory in the 1975 Contest. Armenia finished fourth, which equals their best result to date, while Hungary finished fifth, achieving its best result since its fourth place in 1994. Of the \"Big Five\", only Ruth Lorenzo of Spain achieved a place in the top ten. A new record of 195 million viewers for the Eurovision Song Contest was reported. The of the 2014 Contest was released by Universal Music Group on 14 April 2014, and featured all 37 songs from the contest, including the official #JoinUs theme performed during the interval act of the grand final. The host broadcaster, DR, and the EBU won the International TV Award at the Ondas Awards for their production of the contest."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Living in Fear is the second album from the supergroup The Power Station, released in 1996. In the pre-recording stage of the album, the band had the same lineup as for their previous album in 1985 (Robert Palmer, Andy Taylor, John Taylor and Tony Thompson), and all four musicians worked on the writing and arranging of the songs. However, John Taylor was going through a divorce at the time, as well as entering drug rehab, and pulled out before the album was recorded. Instead Bernard Edwards, the producer, played all bass parts on Living In Fear, and took over as the group's official fourth member. John Taylor still receives writing and arranging credits on the finished album, but does not play on it, and is not listed as a group member. Unfortunately, Edwards died of pneumonia in Japan before the album was released; the album is dedicated to his memory. These two events did not help the album and it was not a commercial success, with only one single, \"She Can Rock It\", being released. The band, now officially a trio, toured in support of the album in 1996, with Guy Pratt (bass) and Luke Morley of Thunder (additional guitar) along as session musicians. The set-list contained a mix of Palmer, Chic, old and new Power Station songs."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Infruset is the sixth studio album by Swedish band Mando Diao and the band's first album in their mother language Swedish. In 2011, on the occasion of Swedish poet Gustaf Fr\u00F6ding's (1860\u20131911) hundredth death year, Gustaf Nor\u00E9n was asked to set one of his poems to music. The beauty and honesty of Fr\u00F6ding's poetry as well as his eccentric and anguished way of living was appealing to the band. Fr\u00F6ding's poetry is telling stories about the beauty of nature, about love and life's challenges. Gustaf Nor\u00E9n and Bj\u00F6rn Dixg\u00E5rd chose ten of his poems; the album's recording took place in an old barn that was transformed into a studio, and was finished after a few days only. The songs are slow and melancholic ballads. The band is using acoustic guitars and piano as main instruments; drums, bass and strings are providing the smooth and gentle background. The main focus is on Fr\u00F6ding's words, instruments and voices are emphasizing the melancholy within the lyrics. Linn\u00E9a Dixg\u00E5rd, sister of Bj\u00F6rn Dixg\u00E5rd, performs the song \"Titania\". On October 28, 2012, the first public performance of Infruset was celebrated as cinema event with broadcasts in cinemas and theaters in Sweden, Germany and Switzerland. The premiere consisted of two parts \u2013 a biography of Gustaf Fr\u00F6ding and interviews with band members, and the live performance of the new songs. Infruset has turned out to be the band\u00B4s most successful album in Sweden: it has won a Swedish Grammis award, sold four times platinum in Sweden. Due to their success, the band was awarded with the Swedish Rockbj\u00F6rnen, a fan award, as best livegroup in 2013. The album has been in Swedish charts for 97 weeks from November 2012 until September 2014 and is the fourth in the list of \"best albums of all times\" in Sweden.

The album was written entirely by Juan Cirerol, except for the two tracks \"I Love You\" and \"Vida de Perro\", which were written by \"los Picadientes de Caborca\". The artwork was created by Gustavo A. Rodriguez Nava, a Mexico City based visual artist. Ofrenda al Mictlan was recorded in 2008, while in Mexico City with the help of visual artist Txema Novelo, under the independent record label Vale Vergas Discos. The debut album immediately struck a chord with thousands of Mexican listeners who, like Cirerol, grew up loving the music and themes he touches upon. Whether talking about a beautiful chola (La Chola), about stealing money from his mom and taking pills (Clonazepam Blues), middle class bittersweet heartache (Crema Dulce, Clase Media), or issuing a Mexicali excessive heat warning (Hace Mucho Calor), the album includes what are now considered classics in the Mexican rock 'n' roll canon, such as the laid back pot smoking anthem Toque y Rol(which was rated the 17th best song of 2011 by Club Fonograma. Ofrenda al Mictlan went from being a well-kept secret in the Vale Vergas Discos catalog to a distinguished cult album. His song \"Corrido Chicalor\" was named in September 2011 by guardian.co.uk and the Music Alliance Pact, as one of the 35 best new tracks in the world.

Mess+Noise magazine described the album as \"astonishingly brilliant\" in its denunciation of modern life and said: \"This is music as foreboding weather, all downcast greys and apocalyptic reds, thick and blustery and beautiful.\" The magazine said: \"Wirewalker (drummer Joe Talia and bass player Ben Bourke) brings a new spaciousness and extravagance required for the task, while Collette\u2019s vocals have evolved from his hushed confessional roots into a more poised and commanding presence.\" The Vine Music website highlighted the dense, convoluted lyrical content and that \"the piling of details can sometimes find us bemused by his prolixity, our narrator veering from observation to observation, along a dark path we cannot always follow\". Its review noted Collette's \"weary worldview\" and said the album was \"a record of searching discontent, but one that finds plenty of space for careful arrangements. Keyboards and synths blossom and bloom across the songs here, finding their way up through the crevices the trio leave in their playing. Collette's wiry voice is prominent and pushed to do new things, increasingly aided\u2014and with subtlety\u2014by bassist Bourke\"."@en ;

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Japonesque_(album)>	rdf:type	schema:MusicAlbum ;
	dbo:abstract	"Japonesque (capitalized as JAPONESQUE) is the tenth studio album by Japanese recording artist Kumi Koda. It was released on January 25, 2012 by Rhythm Zone. It was also released just a little under a year after her 2011 album, Dejavu. Japonesque marks Koda's tenth consecutive studio album to be produced by Japanese producer and manager Max Matsuura, amongst many other producers, while she contributes to the album as the lead vocalist, background vocalist, and songwriter to majority of the songs. Recorded in Japanese with minor phrases in English language, Japonesque is a Japanese pop album with numerous musical elements such as dance music, R&B, electronica, and rock music. Japonesque was recorded in Japan and the United States, making it Koda's third studio album recorded in the latter country; Additional production and mastering was handled in the United States. Six different formats were released to promote the album; a standalone CD, a CD and DVD bundle, two separate digipak bundles, one a CD and double DVD bundle, and a digital release worldwide. Five different artworks were issued for the album's cover sleeve; the digipak and double DVD bundle has Koda posing in a kimono, the CD and DVD has Koda sitting in a seat, whilst the CD format has her holding a cigarette holder. Upon the album's release, it was met with mixed reviews from music critics. Critics commended the album's production and praised the mixture of musical genres alongside Koda's vocals. However, the length of the material, Koda's songwriting, and the amount of musical genres were common complaints by music critics. Commercially, Japonesque was a success. It became Koda's sixth studio album to reach the top spot on Japan's Oricon Albums Chart, and was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of Japan (RIAJ) for shipments of 100,000 units. The album charted on Korea's Gaon Album Chart and Taiwan's G-Music Albums Chart. Three singles were released from Japonesque, including one extended play and six promotional. The three singles; 4 Times, \"Ai o Tomenaide\", and \"Love Me Back\", performed moderately on Japan's Oricon Singles Chart whilst the latter two received certifications by RIAJ. The album tracks \"Boom Boom Boys\", \"Brave\", \"Escalate\", \"No Man's Land\", \"Slow\", and \"So Nice\" served as the album's promotional tracks with accompanying music videos. Koda promoted the album on her 2012 Japonesque concert tour."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Phase 3 is the third studio album by the American punk rock band The Riverdales. It was released in 2003 through 1-4-5 Records. It was the first new Riverdales album in five years, and the first Riverdales album to feature drummer Dan Lumley. It was re-released on October 7, 2008 by Asian Man Records, who had also reissued the band's first album Riverdales in 2006. The album was completely re-mixed and re-mastered, including five previously unreleased songs and new artwork. Four of the bonus tracks were totally new and one was a new arrangement and recording of \"Mental Retard\" (from the Storm the Streets album). Although the reissue was advertised as having re-recorded vocals, Ben Weasel has stated that this is not correct. The lyrics to the song \"Last Stop Tokyo\" are printed on the back of the CD insert and was the first time that the Riverdales released any lyrics to the public. Although written by Ben Foster, the song \"Wait It Out\" was first recorded by The Lillingtons on their 2001 album The Backchannel Broadcast. Since the relationship between Asian Man and all Ben Weasel related music is now severed, the album may be re-issued yet again sometime in the future."@en ;

It was issued on 21 November 2014 as their first release with Sony Music Australia following their departure from former label Warner Bros. Records. The album comes seven years after their second record Hook Me Up (2007). While they were with Warner Bros. Records, the album was to be issued under the title Life on Mars with a 2012 release date before it was pushed back and eventually shelved. The Veronicas, which was produced from 2010-2014, features collaborations with Butch Vig, Nellee Hooper, Daniel Johns and long time collaborator Toby Gad. The music on the album slightly differs from their previous pop rock/electronic rock albums, featuring a \"progressive pop\" sound, drawing inspiration from numerous genres such as blues, trip hop, rock and roll, grunge and rap. The Veronicas debuted and peaked at number-two on the Australian Albums Chart, becoming their third consecutive number-two chart peak in Australia. The first single from the album, \"You Ruin Me\", debuted at number-one on the Australian Singles Chart where it stayed for three weeks and became their second number-one hit in the country, following \"Hook Me Up\" in 2007. To promote The Veronicas, the duo made various television and radio appearances in Australia, and performed live at venues which included supporting 5 Seconds of Summer on the USA leg of their Rock Out with Your Socks Out Tour. They will embark on the Sanctified Tour in Australia and the UK during February and March in 2015. They went onto promote throughout Europe and America."@en ;

Concerning the lyrics, Mike Hill commented: \"The lyrics are less personal, in that they have nothing to do with my personal experiences or any kind of internal narrative. The new record deals more with reflections on death, endings and the sort of existential cynicism that can easily creep into your consciousness living in a world where there seems be an incredible level of detachment.\" Decibel Magazine ranked Path of Totality #1 in their \"Top 40 Extreme Albums of 2011\" list."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"You Can't Use My Name: The RSVP/PPX Sessions is a posthumous compilation album by Curtis Knight and the Squires featuring Jimi Hendrix. Except for one song, the album compiles recordings made by Knight in 1965 and 1966, with Hendrix providing backup guitar before he moved to England to start the Jimi Hendrix Experience. Knights wrote and sings all of the songs, except for four instrumentals, which are credited to Hendrix. The title refers Hendrix's stipulation to producer Ed Chalpin at the beginning of the 1967 session: Shortly thereafter, Chalpin licensed the recordings to Capitol Records, who issued an album titled Get That Feeling with billing as \"Jimi Hendrix and Curtis Knight\" in 1967. After Hendrix, his managers, and Reprise Records, his official American label, objected to the misleading billing and cover photo of Hendrix performing at the Monterey Pop Festival, Capitol issued a second album Flashing in 1968 billed as \"Jimi Hendrix Plays, Curtis Knight Sings\" with a sketch of Knight and Hendrix. Chalpin subsequently licensed the recordings to dozens of minor record labels, who used rhem to issue well over one hundred purported \"Jimi Hendrix\" albums. To give the appearance of new material, the songs were often doctored by editing and overdubbing and given new names. Hendrix commented, \"They [the Knight/Chalpin sessions] were nothing but jam sessions, man, with a group called the Squires. No, I didn't sing on 'Hush Now', that was dubbed on later by Knight trying to copy my voice.\" After years of litigation, Experience Hendrix, a family company that has managed Hendrix's recording legacy since 1995, acquired the sole rights to the Knight/Chalpin/PPX material. According to producer/engineer Eddie Kramer, You Can't Use My Name presents the best available original recordings without the subsequent doctoring."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Sunset Beach DJ Session 2 is the 2012 release from the artist compilation series of German musician and DJ Andr\u00E9 Tanneberger. Latterly, on his studio LPs and the \"Sunset Beach DJ Session\" series which he launched in 2010, Andr\u00E9 Tanneberger has revealed another of his musical passions alongside melodic, pulsating club music, namely ambient. \"I love ambient and really like listening to it. I have been creating songs in this genre for years. It\u2019s great fun and I find it relaxing,\" ATB explains. Consequently, ATB now presents to us a new edition of the artist compilation series ATB \"Sunset Beach DJ Session\". As on the first, the second volume features an exquisite selection of brand new club tracks on CD1, expertly mixed by Andr\u00E9 into a complete ATB DJ set. CD2 presents an overview of the finest tracks in the genre with a fantastic blend of current tracks and timeless classics. Naturally, \"Sunset Beach DJ Session 2\" also showcases brand new ATB tracks. Each of the two discs promises three new and exclusive ATB tracks. \"Together with my friend Rudi Dittmann a.k.a. Josh Gallahan and the man behind the RuDee and Anova pseudonyms, I produced the club track \"ATB with Rudee feat. Ramona Nerra \u2013 In And Out Of Love\" and the chill out song \"ATB feat. Anova \u2013 Sunset Beach\", both of which can be found on the compilation,\" Andr\u00E9 explains.\"I have taken the plunge and had a first go at a chill out track for \"Sunset Beach DJ Session 2\", produced together with Amurai who is an unbelievably talented producer. I really enjoy working with him on new ideas. Even though he is based in Los Angeles, internet makes it possible to work together intensively, no matter how far apart we are geographically,\" he adds. \"Add to that the fact that I came back from my latest gigs with so many ideas, tracks like \"All You Took\" and \"With You!\" more or less happened over night. I am really happy to be offering so many new ATB tracks to my fans on the new compilation,\" Andr\u00E9 enthuses. \"Sunset Beach DJ Session 2\" sees ATB take his listeners \"on a musical journey, like at my gigs\"."@en ;

dbr:Talk_a_Good_Game	rdf:type	schema:MusicAlbum ;
	dbo:abstract	"Talk a Good Game is the fourth studio album by American recording artist Kelly Rowland. Formerly titled Year of the Woman, the album was released on June 14, 2013 through Universal Republic and its affiliated record labels. Incorporating a base core of R&B and pop music, Talk a Good Game was influenced by the likes of Whitney Houston, Marvin Gaye and Stevie Wonder amongst other of Rowland's idols. Rowland wanted the album to be a celebration of womanhood and referred to the record as her most personal album to date. On the album, she co-wrote all but one song, \"Freak\", a cover of the same 2010 song by entertainer Jamie Foxx from his fourth studio album Best Night of My Life. A deluxe edition, and Target-exclusive edition of the album featuring bonus tracks, was released simultaneously alongside the twelve-track standard edition. Talk a Good Game was promoted with live renditions of the album's songs during the Lights Out Tour, a co-headline concert tour between Rowland and The-Dream. The album was also preceded by the release of the lead single, a Mike Will Made It and Marz production called \"Kisses Down Low\" which peaked in the top-thirty of the US Billboard Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart. A second single, The-Dream-produced \"Dirty Laundry\", was released a month before the album and documents Rowland's initial jealousy of the success Beyonc\u00E9 attained in her solo career following the release of her debut album Dangerously in Love (2003); the song also talks about the domestic abuse that Rowland suffered during a previous relationship. Upon its release, music critics commended the album's cohesive sound and themes throughout, often noting Rowland's most personal and vulnerable lyrics as well as the strength of her vocals. Talk a Good Game debuted at number four on the US Billboard 200 selling 68,000 copies in its opening week, becoming Rowland's third top ten album. The album also debuted at number four on the US R&B/Hip-Hop Albums Chart, failing to match the number one peak that her last album, Here I Am (2011), reached. In 2014, Rowland parted ways with her label, wanting a new start elsewhere and signalling the end of the Talk a Good Game era; the album was her only release under Republic Records."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"All-Time Greatest Hits is a collection of 23 songs that were previously recorded by Ray Stevens, released in 2001. Like many collections of Stevens' music, it concentrates 99% on recordings that were made for the record labels of Monument and Barnaby. The one exception is the first track, \"Sergeant Preston of the Yukon,\" an unsuccessful hit (it charted but failed to make the Billboard Hot 100) that was released in 1960 by the NRC label. \"Sergeant Preston of the Yukon\" makes its first album appearance on this collection. The rest of the selections were recorded between the years of 1966 to 1975. Inside the album cover is a brief essay of Stevens' career that is written by Brian Mansfield along with images of single covers of Stevens' hits \"Mr. Businessman,\" \"Gitarzan,\" \"Sunday Mornin' Comin' Down,\" and \"Everything Is Beautiful.\" In the essay, it is revealed that Stevens' first hit to chart, \"Sergeant Preston of the Yukon,\" was a spoof of the CBS TV series of the same name. As this record slowly gained national attention, the company that owned the rights to the character of Sergeant Preston stated that Stevens used the character without permission and threatened a lawsuit if the record was not removed from the market. As a result, the single only peaked at #108 on the American Pop charts. While most collections contain the album version of \"Freddie Feelgood (And His Funky Little Five Piece Band)\" (which was included on Stevens' 1969 album Gitarzan and overdubbed with audience noises), this compilation contains the single version that was released in 1966. Additionally, the selections of \"Ahab the Arab,\" \"Harry the Hairy Ape,\" and \"Funny Man\" on this collection are not the original hits that were released by Mercury Records but re-recordings for Monument Records (though the collection mistakenly says that \"Ahab the Arab\" and \"Harry the Hairy Ape\" were live recordings; they were overdubbed with audience noises). The track \"Isn't It Lonely Together\" (a hit for former R&B singer Robert Knight) served as a non-charting B-side to a Monument single that is not featured on this collection. \"Sergeant Preston of the Yukon\" and \"Everybody Needs a Rainbow\" were transferred to this CD from an LP disc due to unavailability of a tape source."@en ;

It was her second record on the label after \"Bet'heb Meen\" (Who Do You Love) which was released in 1997. The 2005 record has witnessed a critical success but commercial disappointment. \"Bahibbik Wahashteeny\" is perhaps the least sold record during Angham's entire singing career in the last 10 years, but improved its sale gradually upon the broadcast of its second single \"Bahib Nafsi\" (I Love Myself). However, despite the promotion and Angham's 2005 tour, the record had only a moderate success and Angham was unable to garner any hits from the album except \"Albak\" (Your Heart) and \"Inta Meen\" (Who Are You) which both caused a tremendous success around the Middle East and the Gulf countries, respectively. The record is available on both CD (57:44 minutes) and tape (50:38 minutes) format. The bonus track \"Inta Meen\" (Who Are You) and the remix of \"Bahibbik Wahashteeny\" are only featured on the CD version. In this record, Angham collaborated with many new faces. They include Hend elKady who worked with Angham for the first time as a music composer; her brother Khaled Suleiman and Ismael as new music arrangers; Ameer Teaima, Sultan Salah, Wissam Sabry, Khaled Abou elFateh and Fahd Thamal as the new lyricists."@en ;

The album was produced by Jones with Ian Stanley, Chris Hughes, and Ross Cullum - all of whom had worked with Tears For Fears earlier in the 1980s. The music video for \"The Prisoner\" was notably innovative at the time, mixing multiple photo and video editing tricks at a time when computer-based graphics effects were not widely in use. A successful North American Tour took place in the Summer of 1989 where Howard and his three piece band played many venues in excess of 7,000 capacity. Notably, the album includes the piano instrumental Out of Thin Air, and Guardians of the Breath which was used to soundtrack an episode of the successful TV series Bay Watch. The track Powerhouse was remixed by Danny D and released to clubs. The album was remastered and released on CD (with a host of extra tracks) for the first time in 2012."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Deconstructed is a remix album by British post-grunge band Bush, released on 11 November 1997, through Trauma Records. It did not feature any new material but was a collaborative effort between the band and various producers working in the electronic genre of music to remix some of the band's previously released songs. \"Mouth (The Stingray Mix)\" was released as a single in 1997 and became a minor hit, due largely in part to it being featured prominently in both the trailer and the 1997 film An American Werewolf in Paris. Three tracks from this album, \"Mouth (The Stingray Mix)\", \"Everything Zen (The Lhasa Fever Mix)\", and \"Swallowed (The Goldie/Both Sides Toasted Please Mix)\" also appear on Bush's 2005 greatest hits compilation, The Best of: 1994-1999.

Musically, the album is heavier than the band's previous work, marking the culmination of their progression from a largely punk to metal sound.[citation needed] Lyrically the songs concern \"darker\" themes; for example stalking on \"Can I Run\", and depression and insanity on \"Questioning My Sanity\". The song \"Andres\" was released as a single and peaked at #34 in the UK in July 1994. \"Can I Run\" and \"Stuck Here Again\" were both released as promotional singles. The song \"Fuel My Fire\" which is largely based on the Cosmic Psychos' tune \"Lost Cause\" was covered later on by the electronic band The Prodigy on their The Fat of the Land album.

It was McVie's first solo recording since 1984, and the first since her departure from Fleetwood Mac. Many of the songs on the album were composed by McVie and her nephew Dan Perfect, with contributions from ex-Fleetwood Mac guitarist Billy Burnette; Robbie Patton, who co-wrote Fleetwood Mac's 1982 hit \"Hold Me\" with McVie; George Hawkins, ex-member of Mick Fleetwood's Zoo in the mid-1980s, and McVie's ex-husband Eddy Quintela. Except for a few interviews, McVie did not intend to promote the album. As a result, In the Meantime only reached #133 on the UK Albums Chart and failed to enter the U.S. Billboard 200. Debuting at peaking at #32 on the Billboard Independent Albums, it had sold around 20,000 copies in the United States up until 2005, according to Nielsen SoundScan. In a 2014 interview in the Los Angeles Times taken after her returning to Fleetwood Mac, McVie stated about the album that \"It had some good songs on it, but I went about it all wrong\u201D."@en ;

For this album, the band is officially credited as being Chrissie Hynde (vocals, guitar), Adam Seymour (guitar), Andy Hobson (bass) and Martin Chambers (drums). However, this line-up only plays together on one track (\"All My Dreams\"); the rest of the album is performed by Hynde and Seymour in conjunction with a rotating series of musicians on bass and drums. These musicians include Hobson and Chambers, as well as bassists Andy Rourke, Tom Kelly and David Paton, and drummers Jimmy Copley and J.F.T. Hood. A few other session musicians also appear, including Ian Stanley, and one-time Pretenders guitarist Robbie McIntosh, who plays alongside Hynde and Seymour on \"I'm a Mother\". The album also marked the official return of Chambers, who had been fired by Hynde eight years prior."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Mine Is Yours is the third studio album by American indie rock band Cold War Kids. It was released on January 24, 2011 by Downtown Records. Following the mixed reception of 2008's Loyalty to Loyalty, the band sought to work on new material that spanned the course of three months in Nashville and California after two years of touring. Produced by Jacquire King, responsible for the mainstream success of fellow American rock band Kings of Leon, the album marks as a departure from the band's dark blues rock-influenced folk tales heard in their previous albums into a more mainstream sound with lyrics that talk about personal relationships. Mine Is Yours debuted at number 21 on the Billboard 200 and spawned four singles (two official and two promotional): \"Louder Than Ever\", \"Skip the Charades\", \"Finally Begin\" and \"Royal Blue\". The album received a mixed response from critics, with reviews divided by the band's change in sound and lyrical content. To promote the album, the band toured across North America and Europe with appearances at music festivals and talk shows. Mine Is Yours was the band's last album to feature lead guitarist Jonnie Russell, who left for personal reasons."@en ;

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mosh_n\u0027_Roll>	rdf:type	schema:MusicAlbum ;
	dbo:abstract	"Mosh n' Roll is the sixth studio album from metalcore band Bury Your Dead. Most notably, the album marks the return of the band's former vocalist, Mat Bruso. Bruso, who departed from the band after the recording of their 2006 effort, Beauty And The Breakdown, was eventually replaced by the [then] fill-in frontman Myke Terry. During his time with the band, Terry helped write and record two full-length albums: Bury Your Dead (2008) and It's Nothing Personal (2009). Terry left the band in 2010, paving the way for Bruso's return. Mosh n' Roll contains 11 audio tracks, although the final track, \"Mosh n' Roll\" (identical to the album title) is not listed on the back cover or in the liner notes. The song itself was originally recorded and featured on the band's first official album, You Had Me At Hello (2002). The version that appears on Mosh n' Roll (the 2011 album) is simply a re-recorded version of the original, which has become somewhat of an anthem at Bury Your Dead shows throughout their many years of touring. Both the re-recorded track, as well as the 2011 album's title pay homage to Bury Your Dead's roots, particularly when the essential reformation of the band under which the song was originally written is taken into consideration. Of interesting note, with the exception of the above mentioned title track, all of the songs on the album are named after Kurt Vonnegut works. This would not be the first time a Bury Your Dead album carried thematic overtones -- all of the song titles on Cover Your Tracks (2004) are named after movies featuring Tom Cruise, while Beauty and the Breakdown carried an even more holistic theme based on children's fairy-tales. The theme was not simply impressed upon track titles; it permeated the artwork, style, and was creatively incorporated into the fundamental lyrical content, itself. Some 7-8 months after the announcement of Mat Bruso's return to the band, Mosh n' Roll was released on August 2nd, 2011 through Mediaskare Records. The album's record release show took place the same day at The Palladium Upstairs in Worcester, MA. The track listing, as displayed below, reflects the correct naming conventions used on the official album release (verbatim), including any punctuation (or lack thereof)."@en ;

Originally found on four of the band's 1980s album releases, the songs have been re-arranged radically, and have had all the vocals re-recorded by the original vocalists. M\u0113ness dejas is notable as the band's first release on CD, and was done to meet the popular demand for a CD compilation of the band's hits. Thus, its concept could be compared to stopgap quasi-compilation releases from other synthpop artists like Kraftwerk's The Mix (1991) and Yello's 1980\u20131985 The New Mix in One Go (1986), both of which likewise contained newly recorded versions of previously released material.

It was released on October 2, 2012; at the time of release, Evancho was 12 years old. The album is composed of 12 songs used in popular films, arranged by Bill Ross. The songs include a mix of ballads from Disney films, romantic and whimsical themes, and songs that were originally written as singles or show tunes. The producers are Ross and Humberto Gatica for Columbia Records and Syco. In June 2012, Evancho made her second PBS special, Jackie Evancho: Music of the Movies, for the Great Performances series, which features all but one selection from Songs from the Silver Screen. PBS stations began airing the special in August 2012. A DVD of the special was given as a pledge gift by PBS and was later bundled with the Target stores' \"Deluxe Edition\" of Songs of the Silver Screen. Evancho promoted the album with television appearances and a concert tour. The first leg of the tour ran from August 2012 to June 2013, and a second leg of the tour ran from October 2013 to June 2014. The album debuted at #7 on the Billboard 200 and #1 on the Classical Albums chart.

dbr:Soul_Punk	rdf:type	schema:MusicAlbum ;
	dbo:abstract	"Soul Punk is the first full-length solo studio album by American recording artist Patrick Stump, the lead vocalist, guitarist and composer of Fall Out Boy. It was released in the United States on October 18, 2011 through Island Records. Stump's solo project was officially announced in January 2010 and he later revealed his first album's title to be Soul Punk, his first major musical project since Fall Out Boy's hiatus in late 2009. The album features no guest artists (besides a bonus remix track with guest vocals from Lupe Fiasco), and Stump wrote all the tracks and played all the instruments, as well as handling production. He characterised the lyrics as being \"90% metaphors\", with lyrical themes dealing with self-belief, corporate greed, innocence and death. To promote Soul Punk, Stump toured the U.S. twice and played dates in Europe, opened for Bruno Mars and Janelle Monae, played at Chicago and Japan music festivals, and supported Panic! at the Disco on a month-long U.S. fall tour. He also did extensive radio tours to support his record. Rolling Stone included Soul Punk in their \"Fall Music Preview: The Season's Hottest Albums\" and Spin listed it in their \"30 Must-Hear Albums of 2011.\" Soul Punk has had tentative release dates delayed and unconfirmed dates on the internet. Stump originally completed the album in 2010 and had a tentative February 2011 release date but re-did the finished album after he came up with a song called \"This City\". For the album's delay, in place of it is a digital EP, Truant Wave, containing six songs, three of which he collaborated with other artists, released on February 22, 2011 on iTunes. On May 9, 2011 Stump released \"Explode\" to YouTube. A remix of a \"This City\", featuring Lupe Fiasco, was uploaded to YouTube before being released to iTunes and other online outlets on July 26 as the album's first single. Its music video was premiered on Vevo on September 20. Stump revealed the album cover art on September 7, again done by Aakash Nihalani, whom previously did the art for Truant Wave. Soul Punk is also available as a deluxe edition with additional tracks. The remix of \"This City\" is included as a bonus track on both album versions. iTunes' album preorders started on September 27 as well as physical CD preorders from Stump's webstore. With preorders from Stump's online store, a package with a lithograph by Roland Tamayo was available. Soul Punk was released to generally positive reviews by most music critics, with many critics praising Stump's musical direction and songwriting skill, while the negative ones felt the album was too self-indulgent. His sound was compared to Michael Jackson, whom he has cited as a major influence. The album debuted at No. 47 on the Billboard 200 with 9,000 first week sales but fell off the week after, despite its critical reception and promotion."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Election Special is the fifteenth studio album by American recording artist Ry Cooder, released on August 16, 2012, on Perro Verde Records and Nonesuch Records. After his 2011 album Pull Up Some Dust and Sit Down, Cooder continued writing topical and storyline-inspired songs. Displeased with the Republican Party and its financial supporters, he also wanted to write an album that would address listeners during the United States presidential election of 2012, which he believed to be a critical event in the country's history. Election Special was recorded mostly at Drive-By Studios in North Hollywood and produced by Cooder. Election Special is an American roots and blues rock album of protest songs with music characterized by upbeat melodies, simple instrumentation, and sparse arrangements. Cooder played all of the instruments, including bass, guitar, and mandolin, with the exception of drums by his son Joachim. A deeply political album, it expands on the socio-political musings and current event topics of Pull Up Some Dust and Sit Down with forthright, satirical lyrics and song-form vignettes. Cooder's songwriting exhibits liberal and populist sentiments and draws on older musical sources such as broadside ballads and country blues. Election Special was intended to be released a week before the 2012 Republican National Convention, and Cooder released two of its songs to political media outlets. He also felt cynical about the commercial aspect of making albums and did not tour for the album, citing disinterest in playing large concert venues. Upon its release, Election Special received generally positive reviews from music critics, who complimented its topical protest songs and Cooder's musicianship. It peaked at number 164 on the Billboard 200 chart in the US, but charted significantly higher in other countries."@en ;

Its title, lyrics and musical styling are a nod to country music, though the songs of Stephin Merritt remain rooted in classic pop and synthesizers. Virtually every song deals with roads and travel - and several songs' lyrics implicitly reference vampires.[citation needed] The title of the album comes from a quote by J. B. Jackson, 1959: \"Let us hope that the merits and charm of the highway strip are not so obscure but that they will be accepted by a wider public.\"[citation needed] This is the group's first full album in which songwriter Merritt also takes lead vocals. He designed the record's cover art, and has stated it is the album of his he is most satisfied with thus far in his career.[citation needed] Arcade Fire covered \"Born on a Train\" during a live performance on the KCRW program Morning Becomes Eclectic.[citation needed] Lush covered \"I Have the Moon\" as a single B-side, and in the Japanese/Canadian released album Topolino.[citation needed] The song \"Dust Bowl\" was used during an episode of the television series version of This American Life (\"Pandora's Box\").[citation needed]"@en ;

According to the album's detailed liner notes, in November 1998 Columbia Records producer Bob Belden stumbled upon two quarter-inch tapes in Columbia's Los Angeles vault whilst gathering material for a remastered reissue of the Mahavishnu Orchestra's 1972 album Birds of Fire. The tapes were otherwise unlabelled besides the recording location, but upon further inspection they were revealed to be the two-track mixes for what would have been the Mahavishnu Orchestra's third studio album at the time. Guitarist John McLaughlin told The Music Gig magazine in 1977: With the exception of \"John's Song #2\", all compositions on this album were performed on other albums: \"Dream\", \"Trilogy\" and \"Sister Andrea\" appeared on the Mahavishnu Orchestra's 1973 live album Between Nothingness and Eternity, whilst \"I Wonder\" and \"Steppings Tones\" appeared on violinist Jerry Goodman and keyboardist Jan Hammer's 1974 album Like Children."@en ;
