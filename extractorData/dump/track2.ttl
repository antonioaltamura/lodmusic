	dbo:abstract	"\"You've Got a Habit of Leaving\" is a song written by David Bowie in 1965 and released as a single under the name Davy Jones & The Lower Third. It was the last song that Bowie, born David Jones, released before changing his name to avoid confusion with Davy Jones of The Monkees, and the first of two singles that he recorded with The Lower Third after leaving his previous band, The Manish Boys. With The Lower Third, Bowie moved away from Americanised R&B of his two earlier singles into Who-style mod music. However, a typical concert at this time could incorporate \"Mars\" from Gustav Holst's The Planets and \"Chim Chim Cheree\" from Mary Poppins. Bowie's future manager Ken Pitt attended one of these mid-1960s concerts, where the band finished with The Rodgers and Hammerstein song \"You'll Never Walk Alone\"."@en .

	dbo:abstract	"\"Everytime\" is a song by American recording artist Britney Spears, taken from her fourth studio album, In the Zone (2003). It was released on May 10, 2004 by Jive Records as the third single from the album. After her relationship with American singer Justin Timberlake ended in 2002, she made friends with her backing vocalist Annet Artani. They started writing songs together at Spears's house in Los Angeles, and then traveled to Lombardy, Italy, where \"Everytime\" was written. Spears composed the music and she developed the lyrics with Artani. According to Artani, the song was written as a response to Timberlake's 2002 song \"Cry Me a River\". Spears has neither confirmed nor denied these allegations. \"Everytime\" is considered a pop ballad with breathy vocals. Its lyrics are a plea for forgiveness for inadvertently hurting a former lover. The song received general acclaim, with critics complimenting its haunting lyrics and the organic feel of the song in comparison with most of the tracks on its host album. Spears' maturity in the production and her songwriting abilities were also complimented. The song has been named one of Spears' best ballads. \"Everytime\" was a commercial success, peaking inside the top five in most countries, while reaching the top of the charts in Australia, Hungary, Ireland and the United Kingdom. In the U.S. it was a top 20 hit, peaking at number 15 on Billboard Hot 100. Spears performed \"Everytime\" in a series of live appearances such as television shows Saturday Night Live and Top of the Pops. She has also performed the song on piano in a flowered-themed setting at The Onyx Hotel Tour (2004), while suspended on a giant umbrella at The Circus Starring Britney Spears (2009) and in an angel costume at Britney: Piece of Me (2013). \"Everytime\" has been covered by artists such as Glen Hansard and Kelly Clarkson, and was used in the film Spring Breakers (2013). Inspired by the cinematography of Leaving Las Vegas, the music video for \"Everytime\" portrays Spears as a star hounded by paparazzi, who drowns in her bathtub when she starts bleeding from a wound in her head. In the hospital, doctors fail to resuscitate her while a child is born in the next room, implying she has been reincarnated. The original treatment would have had Spears killing herself from a drug overdose, but the plot was removed after it received criticism by organizations such as Kidscape, who perceived it as a glamorization of suicide. Critics noted the video for its religious references to The Passion of the Christ, Kabbalah and stigmata, and for predicting Spears's future struggles with fame."@en ;

dbr:Mein_Teil	rdf:type	dbo:MusicalWork ;
	dbo:abstract	"Mein Teil (German: \"My share\", \"My part\" or slang for \"My penis\") is the first single by the German industrial metal band Rammstein from their fourth album Reise, Reise. The song is inspired by the case of Armin Meiwes and Bernd J\u00FCrgen Armando Brandes. In March 2001, in Rotenburg an der Fulda, the two men aged in their 40s met each other, cut off and cooked Brandes' penis and consumed it together. Afterwards, Meiwes killed Brandes \u2014 with Brandes' permission \u2014 and ate his remains. As a result, Meiwes was sentenced to eight-and-a-half years in jail for manslaughter, but was later charged with murder and sentenced to life imprisonment. A prominent phrase in the song is \"... denn du bist, was du isst, und ihr wisst, was es ist\" (\"Because you are what you eat, and you (pl.) know what it is\"). According to bassist Oliver \"Ollie\" Riedel, the song came about after \"one of our members brought a newspaper to rehearsal and it had a story about the cannibal guy in it. We were fascinated, shocked and amused at the same time\". Vocalist Till Lindemann stated, \"It is so sick that it becomes fascinating and there just has to be a song about it\". \"Mein Teil\" attracted controversy in Germany; the media dubbed it \"Das Kannibalenlied\" (\"The Cannibal-Song\"), which helped to boost it to second place in the German music charts after its release in early August 2004. Remixes of the song were done by Arthur Baker and the Pet Shop Boys. At the beginning of the song in the video, the phrase \"Suche gut gebauten Achtzehn- bis Drei\u00DFigj\u00E4hrigen zum Schlachten \u2013 Der Metzgermeister\" (\"Looking for a well built 18- to 30-year-old to slaughter \u2013 The Master Butcher\") is spoken, voiced by Ollie, although the album version of the song does not have this beginning. The quote is taken from an online post by Armin Meiwes. \"Mein Teil\" was nominated for Best Metal Performance at the 48th Grammy Awards but lost to Slipknot's \"Before I Forget\"."@en ;

Having previously recorded the music for the song, Harrison tailored the lyrics to serve as a personal tribute to his former Beatles bandmate John Lennon, following the latter's murder on 8 December 1980. The recording also includes performances by ex-Beatles Ringo Starr, on drums, and Paul McCartney, who overdubbed backing vocals onto the basic track. Released in May 1981, the single spent three weeks at number 2 on the US Billboard Hot 100, and peaked at number 13 on the UK Singles Chart. In addition, it topped Canada's RPM singles chart and spent one week at number 1 on Billboard's Adult Contemporary listings. \"All Those Years Ago\" was the first time that Harrison, McCartney and Starr had appeared on the same recording since the Beatles' \"I Me Mine\" in 1970, and the last time they would appear together until \"Free As a Bird\", in 1995. Other musicians performing on the track include Al Kooper and Ray Cooper. The song has appeared on the Harrison compilations Best of Dark Horse 1976\u20131989 and Let It Roll, and a live version recorded in 1991 with Eric Clapton was included on Harrison's Live in Japan double album.

dbr:I_Heard_It_Through_the_Grapevine	rdf:type	dbo:MusicalWork ;
	dbo:abstract	"\"I Heard It Through the Grapevine\" is a song written by Norman Whitfield and Barrett Strong for Motown Records in 1966. The first recording of the song to be released was produced by Whitfield on Gladys Knight & the Pips and released as a single in September 1967; it went to number two in the Billboard chart. Smokey Robinson & the Miracles included their version on their 1968 album, Special Occasion. The Marvin Gaye version was placed on his 1968 album In the Groove, where it gained the attention of radio disc jockeys, and Gordy finally agreed to its release as a single in October 1968, when it went to the top of the Billboard Pop Singles chart for seven weeks from December 1968 to January 1969 and became for a time the biggest hit single on the Motown label (Tamla). The Gaye recording has since become an acclaimed soul classic, and in 2004, it was placed on the Rolling Stone list of The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time. On the commemorative 50th Anniversary of the Billboard Hot 100 issue of Billboard magazine in June 2008, Marvin Gaye's \"Grapevine\" was ranked 65th. It was also inducted to the Grammy Hall of Fame for \"historical, artistic and significant\" value. In addition to being released several times by Motown artists, the song has been recorded by a range of musicians including Creedence Clearwater Revival, who made an eleven-minute interpretation for their 1970 album, Cosmo's Factory; and has been used twice in television commercials \u2013 each time using session musicians recreating the style of the Marvin Gaye version: the 1985 Levi's commercial, \"Launderette\", featuring male model Nick Kamen, and the 1986 California raisins promotion with Buddy Miles as the singer for the clay animation group The California Raisins."@en ;

The song was produced for the England football team's 1990 FIFA World Cup campaign, and features a guest rap by England footballer John Barnes and additional vocals by several members of the 1990 English team and comedian Keith Allen, who had co-written the lyric. One band member reportedly gleefully claimed to the NME that they hoped it it \"would be the last straw for Joy Division fans,\" noting how its upbeat sound had inverted their former band's famously gloomy image. The song was originally announced as being called \"E for England\" but the Football Association vetoed the title, realising that it sounded suspiciously like a reference to the drug ecstasy.

It was written by Clarkson with the song's producers Max Martin and Dr. Luke. The song was released on April 12, 2005 as the second single from the album. Clarkson considered \"Behind These Hazel Eyes\" as one of her favorite songs and she once intended to name Breakaway after the song. \"Behind These Hazel Eyes\" is an uptempo pop rock song that incorporates crunchy guitars which are pulsated with driving beats and anthemic choruses; it narrates Clarkson's broken relationship with her ex-boyfriend. \"Behind These Hazel Eyes\" peaked at number six on the Billboard Hot 100 and stayed inside the top ten in the chart for fifteen weeks. It also became Clarkson's first song to top the Adult Pop Songs chart. It was certified platinum from Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for selling over one million digital downloads. Elsewhere, the song charted in the top ten in Austria, Netherlands, New Zealand and the United Kingdom. The song's accompanying music video was directed by Joseph Kahn and produced by Danyi Deats-Barrett. The concept of the video was conceived by Clarkson and depicts her as a bride who experiences some dream-like hints that her husband-to-be is having an affair with a brunette ceremony attendee. The music video premiered online at MTV and it also received heavy rotation on Total Request Live. The song was performed live by Clarkson at numerous venues, including the Breakaway World Tour (2005) and the All I Ever Wanted Tour (2009)."@en ;

It was also released as the b-side of the single \"Whole Lotta Love\". The song is about a groupie who stalked the band early in their career. A misprint by Atlantic Records resulted in in the original UK pressings of Led Zeppelin II being titled \"Livin' Lovin' Wreck (She's a Woman)\", with the \"Wreck\" corrected to \"Maid\" and the subtitle changed on the US and later releases. It is often noted that this is guitarist Jimmy Page's least favourite Led Zeppelin song, and was thus never performed in concert. It was also one of the few Led Zeppelin songs on which Jones sang backing vocals. Conversely, singer Robert Plant took a liking to the song, and played it on his 1990 solo tour promoting his album Manic Nirvana. For the recording of this track, Page played on a Vox 12-string guitar. When heard on the radio it was typically played immediately after their song \"Heartbreaker\", as it flows seamlessly from the abrupt ending of that song on the original album, and thanks to the similarities of subjects involved in the two songs."@en ;

The song, which was written and produced by Max Martin and Lukasz \"Dr. Luke\" Gottwald, was released as the lead single from Breakaway two weeks before the album was released. It is an uptempo pop rock, and power pop song that infuses electronic sound with a mixture of soft and loud alternative rock sound. Martin originally wrote \"Since U Been Gone\" with Pink in mind but she turned it down. It was then given to Hilary Duff but she rejected the song because she could not reach its higher notes. The song was finally given to Clarkson after Clive Davis convinced the writers to give it to her. Clarkson decided to add heavier guitars and harder drums to the song after noticing that the demo had an obvious pop sound. Lyrically, the song is written from a woman's point of view where she expresses her sense of relief with the end of her troubled relationship. \"Since U Been Gone\" received general acclaim from music critics who considered the song to be the highlight of Breakaway. Critics also felt that it was one of the best pop songs in the last decade. Rolling Stone ranked it at number 482 of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time in 2010. \"Since U Been Gone\" was a commercial success. In the United States, the song peaked at number two on the Billboard Hot 100. It topped the US Pop 100 for six consecutive weeks and the US Pop Songs for seven consecutive weeks respectively. It was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for shipments of over one million copies sold. \"Since U Been Gone\" was also a worldwide success, peaking in the top five in Austria, Australia, Ireland, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom.

The song's verses are closer to being spoken rather than sung (i.e., recitation), and tell the story of a boy named Johnny, in a variant on the classic deal with the Devil. The performances of Satan and Johnny are played as instrumental bridges. The song was the band's biggest hit, reaching number three on the Billboard Hot 100. It is featured in the 1980 movie Urban Cowboy, whose choreographer, Patsy Swayze, claims that she set the song's tempo. \"How fast can you dance it?\" Daniels asked. \"How fast can you play it?\" Swayze replied."@en ;

It was also a top ten single in the United Kingdom, Belgium, New Zealand, and was a number one single in the Czech Republic. In the United States, the song became symbolic after Hurricane Katrina, where it was dedicated to victims of the disaster and it also regarded as a dedication to the victims of the September 11th attacks that occurred in 2001.

dbr:What_Have_You_Done_for_Me_Lately	rdf:type	dbo:MusicalWork ;
	dbo:abstract	"\"What Have You Done for Me Lately\" is a song recorded by American singer-songwriter Janet Jackson for her third studio album, Control (1986). Jackson co-wrote the song with its producers Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis, who produced the track. It was released on January 13, 1986 as the album's lead single by A&M Records. After two unsuccessful albums and a management change, the singer began developing a new album. \"What Have You Done for Me Lately\" was originally penned for one of Jam and Lewis's own records, but the lyrics were rewritten to convey Jackson's feelings about her recent divorce from James DeBarge in January 1985. It revolves around a woman's frustration with her partner in a relationship. Critical reviews for \"What Have You Done for Me Lately\" were positive, with music critics believing it erased the former \"pop-ing\u00E9nue image\" of Jackson's first two albums, reestablishing her as an \"independent woman\" figure. The song has been featured in critic lists as one of the greatest songs of all times and received one nomination for Best Rhythm & Blues Song on the 29th annual Grammy Awards of 1987. The song peaked at number four on the US Billboard Hot 100 and was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). It also peaked at number two on the US Dance Club Songs and topped the US Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs charts. Outside of the US, it topped the singles chart in the Netherlands and peaked within the top ten in Germany, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom. The accompanying music video for \"What Have You Done for Me Lately\" was directed by Brian Jones and Piers Ashworth and choreographed by singer Paula Abdul. In it, Jackson goes to a diner with her friends to talk about her relationship problems. The video won a Soul Train Music Award for Best R&B/Soul or Rap Music Video in 1987. The song was first performed live by Jackson at the 29th annual Grammy Awards in 1987. She has also performed it live in each of her concert tours, beginning with the Rhythm Nation World Tour 1990 through the Unbreakable World Tour (2015-2016). It has been included in each of Jackson's greatest hits albums Design of a Decade: 1986\u20131996 (1995), Number Ones (2009) and Icon: Number Ones (2010). \"What Have You Done for Me Lately\" has been sampled and covered by various artists, and is also regarded as one of Jackson's signature songs which helped establish her as a known artist."@en ;

The song is typical of the style Everlast embraced after leaving hip-hop trio House of Pain, being a combination of rock, hip-hop and blues incorporating characterization and empathy towards impoverished protagonists. The song went to number-one on the Billboard Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks chart for one week and number-one on the Hot Modern Rock Tracks for nine weeks. It also peaked at #13 on the Billboard Hot 100, becoming the singer's only solo Top 40 hit on the US pop chart to date. In the United Kingdom, the song reached #34 on the UK Singles Chart. The song went to the Top 5 hitting #4 on the Pop Songs chart. The song was also unexpectedly and surprisingly a hit to adult contemporary stations since most rap songs or songs with rap verses cannot be played on the format. Despite that, the song went to the Top 10 at #9 on the Adult Top 40 chart."@en ;

Alongside \"Hit the Lights\" and \"No Remorse\", \"Jump in the Fire\" is one of Metallica's first original songs, having been included on Ron McGovney's '82 Garage demo, an unreleased recording. The original lyrics and content, which dealt with sex, were written by Dave Mustaine in his former band \"Panic\" at the age of 16. The original version that Mustaine introduced to Hetfield and Ulrich upon joining Metallica was raw. The three worked together on refining the song and the final outcome is what is heard on the demo. However, much like the events surrounding \"The Four Horsemen\", new lyrics were written by James Hetfield upon Mustaine's departure from Metallica. The new lyrics revolve around people being damned to Hell and therefore \"jumping in the fire.\" Lars Ulrich claims that they had written the song to sound like \"Run to the Hills\" by Iron Maiden, which was popular at the time.

	dbo:abstract	"\"Pictures of Matchstick Men\" is the first hit single by Status Quo, released in January 1968. It reached number seven in the British charts, number eight in Canada, and number twelve on the Billboard Hot 100, becoming their only hit single in the United States. Francis Rossi confirmed on DVD2 of the Pictures set that it was originally intended to be a B-side to \"Gentleman Joe's Sidewalk Cafe\", but it was decided to swap the B-side and the A-side of the single. There are two versions of the song, a stereo and mono version, with significant differences: the mono version, which was the original single, has the trademark psychedelic wah-wah guitar in the breaks between lyrics, but the stereo version omits it. The song opens with a single guitar repeatedly playing a simple four note riff before the bass, rhythm guitar, drums and lyrics begin. \"Pictures of Matchstick Men\" is one of a number of songs from the late sixties to feature the audio effect phasing. Their following release, \"Black Veils of Melancholy\", was similar but flopped, which caused the group to change direction. Francis Rossi said about the song: The \"matchstick men\" of the song refers to the paintings of L.S. Lowry."@en ;

However, it debuted at number 12 on the Billboard Hot 100 Singles Sales chart on 31 July, causing \"Irish Blood, English Heart\" to re-enter the chart for a week. By September, it had been added to the playlists of a few stations that supported the last single, including WNNX (Atlanta), CD101 (Columbus), KROQ, WHTG-FM (Monmouth / Ocean), KMBY, WROX-FM (Norfolk), XTRA, and KITS (San Francisco). However, despite at one point being nearly in the 50 most played alternative rock songs in the United States, \"First of the Gang to Die\" was never played in enough markets to break into the Top 40 portion of the Hot Modern Rock Tracks chart. In October 2011, NME placed it at number 147 on its list \"150 Best Tracks of the Past 15 Years\". The single was covered by Malaysian singer-songwriter, indie pop artist Zee Avi on her 2009 self-titled debut album."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"Set Adrift on Memory Bliss\" is a song by American hip-hop group P.M. Dawn. It was released in October 1991 as the second single from their debut album Of the Heart, of the Soul and of the Cross: The Utopian Experience. Writing credit is given to Attrell Cordes (Prince Be of P.M. Dawn) and Gary Kemp of Spandau Ballet, as the song is built around samples of their 1983 hit \"True,\" as well as samples from The Soul Searchers' \"Ashley's Roachclip.\" The main drumbeat also samples from Eric B. & Rakim's \"Paid in Full\". This song was the group's first (and only) number-one hit on the US Billboard Hot 100, and also reached number 3 in the United Kingdom. It ranks number 81 on VH1's 100 Greatest Songs of Hip Hop. The song was the first number one song after the debut of the Nielsen SoundScan system, which monitored airplay and sales more closely than before, when Billboard had to rely on manual sales reports and airplay data. According to the test charts of the SoundScan system, \"Set Adrift on Memory Bliss\" was at number one for at least three weeks, but officially has a one-week reign at number one."@en .

	dbo:abstract	"\"Baby, I Love Your Way/Freebird Medley (Free Baby)\" is a song by the American dance-pop band Will to Power. The song combines elements of two previously recorded rock songs: \"Baby, I Love Your Way\", a #12 Billboard Hot 100 hit from 1976 by the British-born singer Peter Frampton; and American Southern rock band Lynyrd Skynyrd's song \"Free Bird\", which hit #19 on the Hot 100 chart in 1975. Will to Power's medley of these two songs had more of a synthesized dance beat (as opposed to the rock ballad-like nature of the two original songs). It spent one week at #1 on the Hot 100 chart dated December 3, 1988. It also peaked at #2 on the Billboard adult contemporary chart. Additionally, in the \"Freebird\" section, the line \"and the bird you cannot change\" in the original version was changed to \"and this bird will never change\". In March and April 2009, VH1 ran a countdown of the 100 Greatest One Hit Wonders of the 80s. Will to Power's \"Baby, I Love Your Way/Freebird Medley\" placed at #97 on the countdown despite the fact the group having another Top 10 hit in 1991 with a cover version of the 1975 10cc hit \"I'm Not in Love.\""@en ;

The sample interpolated of what sounds like a woman having an orgasm is in fact that of actress Lorna Patterson from the 1980 movie Airplane!, when her character Randy is crying to Dr. Rumack (Leslie Nielsen) that she's 26 and never been married.[citation needed] The song can be heard in the video game Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas, on the in-game radio station SF-UR, which also features other house music songs by different artists."@en ;

The video clip alternately features Neil Tennant and Chris Lowe as a pair of doctors, a pair of soldiers in desert combat dress, a judge presiding over Oscar Wilde (the line \"And I my lord, may I say nothing?\" is a close paraphrase of Wilde's comment after being sentenced to hard labour for homosexual practices) and a football referee and fan.

The song was released on December 12, 2001 by Jive Records, as the second single from Britney. \"Overprotected\" is a dance-pop and teen pop song that is about a girl who is tired of being overprotected and just wants to be herself. The song received mixed reviews from contemporary critics, as some reviewers noticed \"Overprotected\" as a way for Spears to \"break free\", despite coming from a singer that is known worldwide since childhood. \"Overprotected\" was released to United States radio on April 1, 2002. While it did not perform well on the Billboard charts in the United States, \"Overprotected\" peaked at number 22 in Canada, while reaching the top five in Italy, Romania, Sweden and United Kingdom. An accompanying music video, directed by Billie Woodruff, portrays Spears dancing inside an abandoned factory, while singing about being overprotected; the music video for \"The Darkchild Remix\", directed by Chris Applebaum, portrays Spears dancing and having fun with her friends. Spears has performed \"Overprotected\" a number of times including at the Dream Within a Dream Tour (2001) and The Onyx Hotel Tour (2004). In 2003, the song received a nomination for a Grammy Award for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance."@en ;

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Breakaway_(Kelly_Clarkson_song)>	rdf:type	dbo:MusicalWork ;
	dbo:abstract	"\"Breakaway\" is a song recorded by American pop-rock singer Kelly Clarkson. The song, written by Matthew Gerrard, Bridget Benenate and Avril Lavigne, was originally intended for Lavigne's debut studio album, Let Go (2002). After being deemed unsuitable for the album, it was passed to Clarkson to be recorded as a soundtrack for the film The Princess Diaries 2: Royal Engagement. Clarkson, who was finishing her second studio album at that time, recorded \"Breakaway\" to tide her fans over until the first single from her new album was released. However, the song's success prompted its inclusion on Clarkson's second album where she decided to name the album after the song. \"Breakaway\" was first released by Walt Disney Records as the first single from The Princess Diaries 2 soundtrack on July 19, 2004. In May 2006, Breakaway was reissued as the fifth and final single from the album of the same name. \"Breakaway\" was well received by music critics, who complimented the song's universal message and its simple lyrics where people could relate to. It incorporates acoustic guitars and airy drums which are interspersed with Clarkson's controlled voice. The lyrics narrate Clarkson's journey as a girl growing up in a small town who follows her dream for self-improvement. \"Breakaway\" was a commercial success outside of the United States, where it peaked within the top 20 of multiple European countries, and in the top 10 in Australia, Belgium, Hungary and the Netherlands. In the US, the song peaked at number six on the Billboard Hot 100 chart and became her third top ten song in the chart. It also topped the US Adult Contemporary for twenty-one non-consecutive weeks, a record that is now shared between herself and Celine Dion's \"A New Day Has Come\". Directed by Dave Meyers, the accompanying music video for \"Breakaway\" portrays Clarkson as a young girl from a small town who follows her dream and becomes an international star. It also contained scenes interspersed from The Princess Diaries 2: Royal Engagement. Clarkson acted out most of the lyrics in the music video because she felt that the song was autobiographical. Critics responded positively to the music video for being faithful to the central theme shared by the song, the film, and Clarkson's personal biography. Clarkson performed the song in a series of live appearances such as television shows Saturday Night Live, The Oprah Winfrey Show and The Tonight Show with Jay Leno. She has performed the song in her concert tours, including the Stronger Tour. \"Breakaway\" has also been covered by many contestants from reality television singing competitions, notably Katie Stevens, a contestant in the ninth season of American Idol, as well as an English pop duo, Belle Amie who finished eleventh in the seventh season of The X Factor. It was also used in Brazilian soap opera Malha\u00E7\u00E3o."@en ;

The song is a remix by Motiv8 of \"Accident\", which appeared on the Saint Etienne/\u00C9tienne Daho Reserection EP, released a few months previously in June, 1995. \"Accident\" itself is a rewritten version of Daho's 1984 French-language hit single \"Weekend \u00E0 Rome\", with original English lyrics. Daho's spoken-word vocals are from the Reserection opening track, \"Reserection\". The single was credited to \"Saint Etienne featuring \u00C9tienne Daho\".

	dbo:abstract	"\"Hustler's Ambition\" is a song by American rapper 50 Cent. Written by 50 Cent and produced by B-Money \"B$\", the song was released as the first single from the soundtrack to the film Get Rich or Die Tryin' (2005). Built around a soul\u2013influenced production sampling the Frankie Beverly and Maze song \"I Need You\", \"Hustler's Ambition\" features lyrics regarding 50 Cent's rise to fortune and fame, intended to mirror the experience faced by 50 Cent's character in the film: it marks a shift from influence of hardcore hip hop present in 50 Cent's earlier work. \"Hustler's Ambition\" was released to digital retailers in the United States in October 2005 via Interscope Records, with a CD release following in February 2006. The song received generally favorable reviews from music critics, many of whom complimented the soulful production and 50 Cent's delivery. Some also found the song to be more musically diverse than the music 50 Cent recorded at the beginning of his career. The song achieved commercial success on a number of music charts, reaching the top 25 of charts across Europe and Australasia, although it only reached number 65 on the US Billboard Hot 100, making it one of 50 Cent's least successful songs in the country. A music video for \"Hustler's Ambition\" was directed by Anthony Mandler, and shows 50 Cent performing the song inside a warehouse whilst preparing for a boxing match."@en ;

dbr:What_Becomes_of_the_Brokenhearted	rdf:type	dbo:MusicalWork ;
	dbo:abstract	"\"What Becomes of the Brokenhearted\" is a hit single recorded by Jimmy Ruffin and released on Motown Records' Soul label in the summer of 1966. It is a ballad, with lead singer Jimmy Ruffin recalling the pain that befalls the brokenhearted, who had love that's now departed. The song essentially deals with the struggle to overcome sadness while seeking a new relationship after the passing of a loved one. The tune was written by William Weatherspoon, Paul Riser, and James Dean, and the recording was produced by Weatherspoon and William \"Mickey\" Stevenson. \"What Becomes of the Brokenhearted\" remains one of the most-revived of Motown's hits. Composers Weatherspoon and Riser and lyricist Dean had originally written \"What Becomes of the Brokenhearted\" with the intention of having The Spinners, then an act on Motown's V.I.P. label, record the tune. Jimmy Ruffin, older brother of Temptations lead singer David Ruffin, persuaded Dean to let him record the song, as its anguished lyric about a man lost in the misery of heartbreak resonated with the singer. Ruffin's lead vocal on the recording is augmented by the instrumentation of Motown's in-house studio band, The Funk Brothers, and the joint backing vocals of Motown session singers The Originals and The Andantes. \"What Becomes of the Brokenhearted\" peaked at number seven on the Billboard Hot 100, and at number six on the Billboard R&B Singles chart. In Britain, it originally reached No. 8, and on reissue in 1974 No. 4, thus making it his highest-placed chart single in the UK. The song originally featured a spoken introduction by Ruffin, similar in style to many of Lou Rawls' performances at the time. The spoken verse was removed from the final mix, hence the unusually long instrumental intro on the released version. The spoken verse is present on the alternate mix from the UK 2003 release Jimmy Ruffin - The Ultimate Motown Collection, and as a new stereo extended mix on the 2005 anthology, The Motown Box:"@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"A Dozen Roses (You Remind Me)\" is a song by American recording artist Monica, taken from her fifth studio album The Makings of Me (2006). It was written by rapper-producer Missy Elliott and Corte Ellis, with production helmed by the former along with David \"Davey Boy\" Lindsey and Cliff Jones. Similar to songs that Monica used to record with Elliott for her previous album, After the Storm (2003), the mid-tempo love song draws from the genres from R&B, hip hop, neo soul, as well as quiet storm and contains limited elements of 1960s Motown soul music. Built around a sample of the 1972 recording \"The Makings of You\", written and performed by Curtis Mayfield, its lyrics detail a woman's admiration for a man. The song was released as the album's second single in the United States on September 28, 2006. It garnered generally positive reviews by music critics who compared it to R. Kelly's \"You Remind Me of Something\" (1995) and praised Elliott's nostalgic, cozy and unpretentious production. \"A Dozen Roses (You Remind Me)\" peaked at number 48 on Billboard's Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart, on which it became the singer's lowest-charting singles since 1999's \"Street Symphony\". The music video for \"A Dozen Roses (You Remind Me)\", directed Chris Robinson, was filmed in Los Angeles in October 2006 and depicts a meet cute between two lovers."@en ;

Their version appeared on MTV's Party to Go Remixed compilation, released in 2001, but as their record company, Tommy Boy Entertainment, folded soon after, their original recording failed to receive a wider release, and the song was eventually sold separately abroad. There it was re-recorded by Columbian pop singer Victoria Faiella for her Epic Records debut. In 2001, Faiella's producer Peter Plate offered the newly created pop group No Angels to re-record \"Daylight in Your Eyes\" for their debut studio album Elle'ments (2001) following their participation in the first installment of the German adaption of the reality television program Popstars. Released as the band's debut single on February 5, 2001 in German-speaking Europe and the following months in the United Kingdom and the United States, the single became a major international hit, reaching number-one in Austria, Estonia, Germany, and Switzerland, making it the No Angels' most successful single release to date. The song became the best-selling single of the year 2001 in Germany, and emerged as one of the best-selling German recordings of the decade, ranking fifth on the highest-selling singles of the 2000s in Germany. It was nominated for an Amadeus Austrian Music Award and awarded the 2002 ECHO Award for Single of the Year (National). \"Daylight in Your Eyes\" received a Platinum certification from the Bundesverband Musikindustrie for shipping half a million copies, and has since been covered by various artists."@en ;

Perry co-wrote the song with its producers Dr. Luke and Benny Blanco, with additional songwriting provided by Max Martin and Cathy Dennis. \"I Kissed a Girl\" is a pop rock song with elements of new wave, with lyrics that are described by Perry as being \"about the magical beauty of a woman\". Upon its release, \"I Kissed a Girl\" received generally mixed reviews from music critics, who praised its sound and structure but highly criticized its lyrical content.

	dbo:abstract	"\"Light My Fire\" is a song by the Doors, which was recorded in August 1966 and released in January 1967 on their self-titled debut album. Released as an edited single in May 1967, it spent three weeks at number one on the Billboard Hot 100 chart in late July, and one week on the Cash Box Top 100, nearly a year after its recording. A year later, it re-entered the Billboard Hot 100 in 1968 following the success of Jose Feliciano's version of the song (which peaked at number 3 on the Billboard chart), peaking at number 87. The song was largely written by the band's guitarist Robby Krieger, and credited to the entire band. The single was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America in September 1967 for one million units shipped. As of December 1971 it was the band's best-selling single, with over 927,000 copies sold. A live version was released in 1983 on their album Alive, She Cried, the first of several live albums released in subsequent decades to include the song. \"Light My Fire\" achieved modest success in Australia, where it peaked at number 22 on the ARIA chart. The single originally reached number 49 in the UK in 1967, but experienced belated success in that country in 1991, when a reissue peaked at number 7. The reissue occurred on the back of revived interest in the band following Oliver Stone's film biopic The Doors. The song is number 35 on Rolling Stone's list of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time. It was included in the Songs of the Century list. Jos\u00E9 Feliciano's cover version won a 1969 Grammy Award for Best Male Pop Vocal Performance, the same year he won another Grammy for Best New Artist."@en ;

Having already referenced literary heavyweights such as Coleridge in \"Welcome to the Pleasuredome\" and Thomas in \"Rage Hard\", for \"Warriors of the Wasteland\" Holly Johnson turned to T. S. Eliot for inspiration. Johnson cited Eliot's The Waste Land poem, the 1981 Mel Gibson film, Mad Max 2, and the 1979 film, The Warriors as inspirations. Even though it featured 3 different 12\" singles, \"Warriors of the Wasteland\" reached number 19 in the UK Singles Chart (making it the group's first UK hit not to go Top Five), #7 in Germany (for two weeks) and #13 in Switzerland."@en ;

Written by guitarist Carl Bell, it is the first single by the band to feature new lead singer Toryn Green. New Fuel drummer Tommy Stewart was unable to perform on the record as he had other obligations to fulfill, so longtime M\u00F6tley Cr\u00FCe drummer Tommy Lee performed drums on the track. Two versions appear on the album, a \"G-mix\" mixed by producer Ben Grosse (Something Like Human) and an \"S-mix\" mixed by Michael Shipley. While both versions are similar, the \"S-mix\" features fewer electric guitars than the \"G-mix\" does. The song peaked at number 24 on Billboard's Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks, staying on the chart for 14 weeks.

dbr:You_to_Me_Are_Everything	rdf:type	dbo:MusicalWork ;
	dbo:abstract	"\"You to Me Are Everything\" is a single by The Real Thing. Written by Ken Gold and Michael Denne and produced by Ken Gold, \"You to Me Are Everything\" was The Real Thing's sole number-one single in the UK Singles chart, spending three weeks at the top in July 1976. A remixed version of the song returned to the chart in March 1986 reaching number five. The song was a minor hit in the U.S. where it peaked at number 64 on the Billboard Hot 100 singles chart and number 28 on the Billboard R&B chart. One of the reasons for its lack of success in the U.S. was the flood of cover versions of the song released at the same time. American groups Broadway and Revelation both released versions of the song the same week, and at one point all three versions of the song appeared on Billboard Hot 100 and R&B charts. With radio and the public unable to agree on a single popular version, the three singles effectively prevented each other from becoming a hit.[citation needed] The song was subsequently covered by Frankie Valli, Sonia, Tiny Tim, Public Enemy, Sean Maguire and Andy Abraham. In 1997, the Italian song-writer Marina Rei successfully recorded \"Primavera\" (\"Spring\"), an Italian version of \"You to Me Are Everything\". A fennecized version entitled \"Ei enemp\u00E4\u00E4 voi pyyt\u00E4\u00E4\" was recorded in 1978 by Petri Pettersson. The song was very most popular in the Philippines."@en ;

dbr:The_Sound_of_Silence	rdf:type	dbo:MusicalWork ;
	dbo:abstract	"\"The Sound of Silence\" is a song by the American music duo Simon & Garfunkel. The song was written by Paul Simon over the period of several months between 1963 and 1964. A studio audition led to the duo signing a record deal with Columbia Records, and the song was recorded in March 1964 at Columbia Studios in New York City for inclusion on their debut studio album, Wednesday Morning, 3 A.M.. Released in October 1964, the album was a commercial failure and led to the duo breaking apart, with Paul Simon returning to England and Art Garfunkel to his studies at Columbia University. In spring 1965, the song began to attract airplay at radio stations in Boston, Massachusetts, and throughout Florida. The growing airplay led Tom Wilson, the song's producer, to remix the track, overdubbing electric instrumentation with the same musicians who backed Bob Dylan's \"Like a Rolling Stone\". Simon & Garfunkel were not informed of the song's remix until after its release. The single was released in September 1965. The song hit No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 for the week ending January 1, 1966, leading the duo to reunite and hastily record their second album, which Columbia titled Sounds of Silence in an attempt to capitalize on the song's success. The song was a top-ten hit in multiple countries worldwide, among them Australia, Austria, West Germany, Ireland, Japan and the Netherlands. Generally considered a classic folk rock song, the song was added to the National Recording Registry in the Library of Congress for being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically important\" in 2013 along with the rest of the Sounds of Silence album. Originally titled \"The Sounds of Silence\" on Wednesday Morning, 3 A.M., as well as on the single release and Sounds of Silence album, the song was re-titled for later compilations beginning with Simon and Garfunkel's Greatest Hits."@en ;

The song remains popular and is played at many sporting events in the U.S. and Europe, with crowds using the dance in which the arms are used to spell out the four letters of the song's title as an opportunity to stretch. Moreover, the song also remains particularly popular due to its status as a disco classic . \"Y.M.C.A.\" appeared as Space Shuttle Wakeup call on mission STS-106, on day 11.

	dbo:abstract	"\"Man! I Feel Like a Woman!\" is a song recorded by Canadian singer-songwriter Shania Twain taken from her third studio album, Come On Over (1997). Written by Twain with her longtime collaborator Robert John \"Mutt\" Lange, who also produced the track, the song was released first to North American country radio stations in March 1999 as the seventh single from the album, and later it was released worldwide in September 1999. \"Man! I Feel Like a Woman!\" is a country pop song with lyrics about female empowerment. The song received generally favorable reviews from music critics, who praised the song's attitude and hook as well as Twain's vocals. Commercially, the song was also successful, reaching the top-ten in six countries, while reaching the top-twenty in Canada and number 23 on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart. It was even more successful on the Hot Country Songs chart, reaching the top-five and was certified Gold by the RIAA for 500,000 digital downloads. The song also won a Grammy for Best Female Country Vocal Performance in 2000. The accompanying music video for \"Man! I Feel Like a Woman!\" was released on March 3, 1999, and it pays homage to Robert Palmer's \"Addicted to Love\" music video, featuring Twain dancing with buffed and blank-eyed male models. The song was the opening song on both Twain's Come On Over Tour and the Up! Tour as well as Twain's headline on the Super Bowl XXXVII Halftime show. It was also used to comic effect in a 2004 Chevy Colorado TV commercial, as well as being on the soundtrack of Brazilian telenovela La\u00E7os de Fam\u00EDlia and the director's cut version of comedy action film Alaska Hillbily Hell. The song was also performed by American Idol winner Carrie Underwood during the fourth season, and by Britney Spears in her first movie Crossroads (2002)."@en ;

dbr:Material_Girl	rdf:type	dbo:MusicalWork ;
	dbo:abstract	"\"Material Girl\" is a song by American singer Madonna from her second studio album Like a Virgin (1984). It was released on November 30, 1984 by Sire Records as the second single from the album. It also appears slightly remixed on the 1990 greatest hits compilation, The Immaculate Collection, and in its original form on the 2009 greatest hits compilation, Celebration. The song was written by Peter Brown and Robert Rans, while Nile Rodgers produced the track. Madonna explained that the concept of the song was indicative of her life at that time. She felt that \"Material Girl\" was provocative in its content and was attracted to it. \"Material Girl\" consists of synth arrangements with a robotic voice repeating the hook. The lyrics identify with materialism, with Madonna asking for a rich and affluent life, rather than romance and relationships. Contemporary critics have frequently identified \"Material Girl\" along with \"Like a Virgin\" as the songs that established Madonna as an icon. \"Material Girl\" was a commercial success, reaching the top-five in Australia, Belgium, Canada, Ireland, Japan and United Kingdom. It reached the number two position on the Billboard Hot 100 in the United States, becoming her third top-five single there. The music video was a mimicry of Marilyn Monroe's performance of the song \"Diamonds Are a Girl's Best Friend\" from the 1953 film Gentlemen Prefer Blondes. The mimicked scenes are interspersed with scenes of a Hollywood director trying to win the heart of an actress, played by Madonna herself. Discovering that, contrary to her song, the young woman was not impressed by money and expensive gifts, he pretended to be penniless and succeeded in taking her out on a date. She has performed the song in five of her world tours; most of her performances of the song on tour are mimicries of the song's music video. \"Material Girl\" has been covered by a number of artists, including Britney Spears, The Chipettes and Hilary and Haylie Duff. It has appeared in the films Moulin Rouge! (2001) and Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason (2004). Madonna has often remarked that she regrets recording \"Material Girl\" as its title became a nickname for her in the mainstream media. The song has been labeled an empowering influence for women, and was the subject of debates."@en ;

Columbia Records released \"Get Me Bodied\" as the album's seventh and final single in the US on July 10, 2007. \"Get Me Bodied\" is an R&B and bounce song with dancehall and reggae influences.

The song was generally well received by contemporary music critics, who complimented its party sound and Beyonc\u00E9's vocals.

The urban song, has a similar soundscape to Vanity 6's 1982's song \"Nasty Girl\", while its lyrics talks about being a slave to the music. \"I'm a Slave 4 U\" garnered mixed reception from music critics. Some critics argued it was the singer's most mature sound at the time compared to her previous singles, while other noticed the song's attempt to leave behind Spears' girl next door image and said her vocals were unnatural. \"I'm a Slave 4 U\" achieved commercial success, peaking inside the top-ten in almost every country that it charted on. However, the song peaked at number 27 on the Billboard Hot 100 and at number 85 in Billboard Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs, both being the lowest chart positions of the single worldwide. A music video for the single, which was directed by Francis Lawrence, was released along with the single released. It features Spears dancing in a sauna. Spears' performance of the song at the 2001 MTV Video Music Awards in New York City was highly criticized by animal rights group PETA for the inclusion of exotic animals. Spears performed the song on every tour since its release, including the promotional The M+M's Tour. The song was also featured on the 2002 compilation album Now That's What I Call Music! 9."@en ;

It was released on December 6, 1999, by JIVE Records, as the fourth single from the album. Before recording the song, Spears had to ask the writers of the song, Andreas Carlsson and Kristian Lundin, to re-write it, since it was a sexual song. The singer first recorded her vocals in March 1998, and re-recorded them later on the same year. The dance-pop and teen pop song alludes to a relationship that a woman desires to correct, not quite understanding what went wrong, as she comes to realize that she was \"born to make [her lover] happy\". \"Born to Make You Happy\" received mixed reviews from critics, who praised it for being an early classic and a proficient single, despite considering the song as entirely unremarkable like other ballads on the album. The song was commercially successful worldwide, peaking at number one in Ireland, and reaching top five positions in Belgium, Europe, Finland, Germany, Netherlands, Norway, Sweden and Switzerland. In the United Kingdom, it also peaked at number one, and is Spears' sixth best-selling single in the country. An accompanying music video was directed by Billie Woodruff, and portrays Spears dreaming that she is with her lover, while she sings and dances during the majority of the video. Spears has performed \"Born to Make You Happy\" on four concert tours."@en ;

dbr:From_the_Bottom_of_My_Broken_Heart	rdf:type	dbo:MusicalWork ;
	dbo:abstract	"\"From the Bottom of My Broken Heart\" is a song recorded by American singer Britney Spears for her debut studio album, ...Baby One More Time (1999). It was released on December 15, 1999 by JIVE Records as the fifth and final single from the album. After Spears recorded an unused song from Toni Braxton and sent it through Larry Rudolph to several labels, executives from JIVE Records commented that it was very rare to hear someone so young who could deliver emotional content and commercial appeal, appointing the singer to work with producer Eric Foster White. The teen pop ballad was written and produced by White, and features Spears singing about the loss of a first love and how breaking up can be hard. \"From the Bottom of My Broken Heart\" received mixed to positive reviews from music critics, who noted the song as a classic hit and competent single, despite considering it unremarkable like other ballads on the album and calling it \"another rejection ballad that refers to kissing but nothing else\". \"From the Bottom of My Broken Heart\" achieved moderate success, peaking at number 37 in Australia, and 23 in New Zealand. Through imports, the song managed to peak at number 174 in the United Kingdom. In the United States, \"From the Bottom of My Broken Heart\" reached number 14 on Billboard Hot 100, and 17 on Pop Songs, being later certified Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) on March 28, 2000, for shipping 1,000,000 physical units of the single. It was the 8th best-selling physical single of the 2000s in the country. An accompanying music video, directed by Gregory Dark, was released on December 17, 1999. It portrayed Spears packing her belongings as she readies herself to move away from home, and feeling upset because she knows that she is going to miss her first love. The video was the subject of controversy among the press, who panned the singer for hiring an adult filmmaker to direct her video. A Spears representative commented that they were only aware of Dark doing music videos. The singer performed \"From the Bottom of My Broken Heart\" in a few live appearances, including at the 2000 Grammy Awards, in a medley with \"...Baby One More Time\", and in three of her concert tours."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"Heal the World\" is a song from Michael Jackson's hit album, Dangerous, released in 1991. In a 2001 Internet chat with fans, Jackson said \"Heal the World\" is the song he was most proud to have created. He also created the Heal the World Foundation, a charitable organization which was designed to improve the lives of children. The organization was also meant to teach children how to help others. This concept of 'betterment for all' would become a centerpiece for the Dangerous World Tour. In the documentary Living with Michael Jackson, Jackson said he created the song in his \"Giving Tree\" at Neverland Ranch. An ensemble performance of \"We Are the World\" and \"Heal the World\" closed Jackson's memorial service at the Staples Center in Los Angeles on July 7, 2009. The song was performed as rehearsed by Jackson at the venue just weeks earlier, in preparation for his planned \"This Is It\" concerts in London along with \"Dirty Diana\". R&B singer Ciara sang the song as a tribute to Jackson at the 2009 BET Awards. The song was played at the funeral of James Bulger, and Jackson also donated the song to be used as the anthem for the charity the James Bulger Red Balloon Center, a school for children to go to if they are being bullied or have learning difficulties."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"How Do I Live\" is a song written by Diane Warren. It was originally performed by LeAnn Rimes from her album You Light Up My Life: Inspirational Songs in 1997 and later performed by Trisha Yearwood. Both versions were released on May 27, 1997. In the U.S., Rimes's version peaked at No. 2 for four non-consecutive weeks in late 1997 and early 1998, behind \"Candle in the Wind 1997\" by Elton John, and \"Truly Madly Deeply\" by Savage Garden. It set a record for staying on the Billboard Hot 100 chart for 69 weeks, a record it held until \"I'm Yours\" by Jason Mraz set a new record of 76 weeks. The Rimes recording also set the record for the most time in the Billboard Hot 100's top 10 at 32 consecutive weeks, and the record for Billboard Hot 100's top 40 at 62 consecutive weeks; both records still hold. It ranks at No. 4 on Billboard's All Time Top 100, the only single on the top 10 of this list not peaking at No. 1. The only songs that finished ahead of it were Bobby Darin's cover of \"Mack the Knife\", Santana's song \"Smooth\", and Chubby Checker's version of \"The Twist\". It has been certified 3\u00D7 Platinum by the RIAA for shipments of 3 million copies in the United States, the highest certified country single of that time, to be surpassed twelve years later by \"Love Story\" from artist Taylor Swift, which has been certified 8\u00D7 Platinum. Despite only peaking as high as No. 7 in the UK Singles Chart, Rimes' version of \"How Do I Live\" spent 34 weeks on the chart, ending up as the 6th best selling single of 1998. As of August 2014, the song has sold 710,000 copies in the UK. \"How Do I Live\" was also covered by F.I.R. (Faye and Real featuring LeAnn Rimes). F.I.R. invited Rimes to record a portion of the song for their third album Flight Tribe in 2006."@en ;

Miller expounded on this in the Music for the Masses re-master documentary DVD, stating he felt the original single version was too complicated and would benefit from being simplified.

The B-sides for \"World in My Eyes\" are \"Happiest Girl\" and \"Sea of Sin\". \"Happiest Girl (Jack Mix)\" and \"Sea of Sin (Tonal Mix)\" are the main 7\" versions. \"Original\" versions were never released, or rather, these mixes are the regular versions, according to interviews and the official website. Reaching No.17 in UK, and only No.52 on the Hot 100, it is the least successful single from Violator.

Whitney also earned her first Grammy Award with the song, on the category Grammy Award for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance. Commercially, the song topped the Billboard Hot 100, being her first number one on the charts; it also went to number one in the UK and Ireland, and was her first song to chart in those countries.

dbr:All_Is_Full_of_Love	rdf:type	dbo:MusicalWork ;
	dbo:abstract	"\"All Is Full of Love\" is a song by Icelandic musician Bj\u00F6rk and is from her fourth studio album, Homogenic (1997). The lyrics are inspired by the presence of love in the advent of spring and Norse mythology's Ragnar\u00F6k. The more popular version of the track, the original mix solely produced by Bj\u00F6rk, was used in the music video but did not appear in the album. The album version is a remix by Howie B and has a minimalist approach and places emphasis on the singer's vocals. The video features a combination of electronic beats and string instruments. A remix by the German IDM duo Funkst\u00F6rung was released as a single in the summer of 1998. The song later received a full single release in June 1999 to coincide with the release of its music video. While some commentators declared that the song was one of the highlights of the Homogenic album, the single performed moderately on the UK Singles Chart, peaking at number 24. In the United States it was a dance hit. The song and music video were released two years after the release of the album for artistic merit rather than promotional purposes. The song was included as the opening track in the compilation album Greatest Hits (2002), whose tracks were selected by fans through a survey. \"All Is Full of Love\" is regarded by some as the first DVD single. The accompanying music video, \"All Is Full of Love\" was directed by Chris Cunningham and depicts the assembling of a robot with Bj\u00F6rk's features and her passionately kissing another robot against an ethereal and sterile backdrop. The song's video garnered acclaim from critics and is commonly regarded as one of the best music videos of all time and a milestone in computer animation. The subject of much analysis and scrutiny, it was on permanent display at the Museum of Modern Art in New York City and has been included in various art exhibitions. Bj\u00F6rk has performed \"All Is Full of Love\" in five of her tours, with the most recent being the Vulnicura Tour. It is one of Bj\u00F6rk's most idiosyncratic songs, and has been covered by various artists."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"For Those About to Rock (We Salute You)\" is a song by the Australian hard rock band AC/DC. The song was first released on AC/DC's eighth studio album For Those About to Rock We Salute You in 1981, and later as a single in 1982. The single's B-side contains an edited live version of \"Let There Be Rock\", recorded in Landover, Maryland, in late-1981. The video to \"For Those About to Rock (We Salute You)\" was filmed at that same concert. The song was later included on AC/DC's first soundtrack album, Who Made Who, released in 1986 for the Stephen King film Maximum Overdrive. The title and central lyric of the song are based on an ancient salute used by Roman prisoners to be executed in the Colosseum, \"Ave, Caesar, morituri te salutant\" (\"Hail Caesar, we who are about to die, salute you.\"). However, Angus Young later said that the inspiration for the cannons came from a very different source. The band was cutting the first recordings of the song on the same day as Princess Diana of Great Britain's televised wedding. Angus recalled that \"someone had the wedding on in the next room ... we were playing that part of the song when the cannons were going off and we paused a second and went 'hmmm ... that actually sounds pretty good.'\"[citation needed] This coincidence also led to a cannon being featured on the cover of the album and single, as well as life-sized Napoleonic cannons becoming a regular stage prop at AC/DC concerts. The cannons fired in the song are mixed with exploding fireworks. However the actual takes were recorded later the next month as the mobile truck used to record the album (Mobile One) was being used to record Peter Gabriel's 4th eponymous album during the marriage of Charles and Diana. AC/DC have often used the song to close live concerts, such as Live at Donington and No Bull as well as on their live CD AC/DC Live. It is also the song that concludes the most recent tour, Rock or Bust."@en ;

The song was written by Winehouse and Mark Ronson, and produced by Ronson. \"Back to Black\" was inspired by Winehouse's relationship with Blake Fielder-Civil, who had left her for an ex-girlfriend. \"Back to Black\" received universal acclaim by music critics, who generally praised its throwback sound to girl groups from the 1960s. It was included on several compiled year and decade-end lists of the best in music and was further considered to be one of the singer's signature songs. The single peaked at number eight on the UK Singles Chart in the United Kingdom and is Winehouse's third best-selling single in that country. Many cover versions by various artists were recorded for the song; most notably, Beyonc\u00E9 and Andr\u00E9 3000 covered it for the soundtrack of the 2013 film adaptation of the novel The Great Gatsby (1925).

dbr:Born_to_Try	rdf:type	dbo:MusicalWork ;
	dbo:abstract	"\"Born to Try\" is a song by Australian recording artist and songwriter Delta Goodrem, written by Audius Mtawarira and produced by Ric Wake for her debut studio album Innocent Eyes (2003). The song was released as the first single off the studio album on 8 November 2002 by Epic Records and Daylight Records. It was later featured on her first Japanese compilation album Innocent Eyes (2006). The song was co-written by her while she was staying at her home in Sydney, Australia for the production of the studio album, as well as written and producing four other songs together. Though many of the public consider this as Goodrem's breakthrough single, it is not her debut single. As the song features instrumentation with a piano, guitars (acoustic and electric) and drums, the song is a low tempo pop song, with influences of piano pop and pop rock. Lyrically, it talks about taking chances and leading your independence. The song was universally praised from music critics, praising Goodrem's vocal abilities and lyrical content. The song is considered as Goodrem's signature song, as the song managed to enter charts around the world, including two number ones in her native Australia and New Zealand. The song also peaked at number three in the United Kingdom, her first single to chart outside of the Oceania. It also charted in many European countries including Ireland, Switzerland and Germany. An accompanying music video was shot for the single, where it featured Goodrem near a lake, then sees her in a more country-side place and also featured her in Helsinki where its effects was presented with timelapse effects. The music video was featured on her video compilation Delta and was performed at both her commercially successful tours; Visualise Australian Tour and Believe Again Australian Tour."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"Motorhead\" is the eponymous song of the British hard rock band of the same name. It was originally recorded by the space rock band Hawkwind, of whom the song's author, Mot\u00F6rhead frontman Ian \"Lemmy\" Kilmister, had been a member from 1971 to 1975. It was the last song that he had written for them, but it had only been released as the B-side of the single \"Kings of Speed\", in March 1975. In May of that year, Lemmy was fired from Hawkwind and formed a new band, naming it after the song. It indicated the direction in which he planned to go: hard rock, not space rock. Mot\u00F6rhead recorded two new versions of the song later that year, one as part of a demo session with producer Dave Edmunds and then another as part of the sessions for what was meant to have been Mot\u00F6rhead's debut album. However, their record label, United Artists Records, decided to shelve the project and dropped the band without releasing any of the material. Over a year later, the song was recorded yet again for Chiswick Records, during the session for their actual debut album and was released ahead of it, in June 1977, as their second 7\" single. Initially issued with the Map of Chiswick label, it was later switched to the Big Beat label and pressed in other formats. The reverse cover is taken up almost entirely with the song's lyrics, printed in a lowercase form of blackletter. Most of the original singles have the words \"a porky prime cut\" inscribed on the run-out groove, indicating that the record was mastered by George Peckham.

dbr:Bring_the_Noise	rdf:type	dbo:MusicalWork ;
	dbo:abstract	"\"Bring the Noise\" is a song by the American hip hop group Public Enemy. It was included on the soundtrack of the 1987 film Less Than Zero and was also released as a single that year. It later became the first song on the group's 1988 album It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back. The single reached #56 on the Billboard Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart. The song's lyrics, most of which are delivered by Chuck D with interjections from Flavor Flav, include boasts of Public Enemy's prowess, an endorsement of Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan, retorts to unspecified critics, and arguments for rap as a legitimate musical genre on par with rock. The lyrics also have a remarkable metrical complexity, making extensive use of meters like dactylic hexameter. The title phrase appears in the chorus. The song includes several shout-outs to artists like Run-DMC, Eric B, LL Cool J and, unusually for a rap group, Yoko Ono and thrash metal band Anthrax, allegedly because Chuck D was flattered about Scott Ian wearing Public Enemy shirts while performing Anthrax gigs. Anthrax would later collaborate with Chuck D to cover the song. The song's production by The Bomb Squad, which exemplifies their characteristic style, features a dissonant mixture of funk samples, drum machine patterns, record scratching by DJ Terminator X, siren sound effects and other industrial noise. Critic Robert Christgau has described the song as \"postminimal rap refracted through Blood Ulmer and On the Corner, as gripping as it is abrasive, and the black militant dialogue-as-diatribe that goes with it is almost as scary as \"Stones in My Passway\" or \"Holiday in the Sun\". \"Bring the Noise\" was ranked #160 on Rolling Stone's list of the 500 greatest songs of all time."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"Signals Over the Air\" is the first single from War All the Time and the first major label single from the band, Thursday, reaching No. 30 on the Billboard Modern Rock Tracks chart. It performed at most live Thursday shows, usually with vocalist Geoff Rickly explaining that the song is about sexual revolution; during the tour following War All the Time, an extended introduction was played before the song. This introduction was recorded as part of the Live from the SoHo & Santa Monica Stores split EP; a live acoustic version of single the song was used on Y100 Sonic Sessions Volume 8, taken from a live radio session recorded by the band in November 2003 at Indre Studios in Philadelphia. A radio edit exists as well, removing much of the bridge near the end of the song. To correspond with the release of War All the Time, Thursday released a video discussing the track. Rickly comments that sexuality used to be talked about in punk rock songs, but it is now seen as taboo. He continues that the song is about gender issues and discussing sexuality in a nonnegative way; he also states that the song is about coming to terms with his own sexual identity, saying he doesn't feel an affinity for male culture such as The Man Show. Rickly relates a story where a gay man used the song to help him, even though people would call him faggot. Rickly states that he has always enjoyed songs like PJ Harvey's \"Man Size\"."@en ;

The song, which is written in the key of B major, was written in memory of frontman Irwin Sparkes' secondary school English teacher, Jonathan \"Mr. A\" Anderton. Sparkes said he was inspired to write the song upon hearing of Anderton's death in 2006. Many of the lyrics such as: \"So busy showing me where I'm wrong - you forgot to switch your feelings on...\", were reflective of Anderton's personality as a teacher, but Sparkes has described him as being a \"really cool guy\" in interviews with the media. Sparkes also says that Anderton requested his students call him \"Mr. A\", as he disliked being called \"Mr. Anderton\". It is from this that the song's title stems. The song has been noted for its similarities to Electric Light Orchestra's single \"Mr. Blue Sky\". The song is part of the soundtrack for the video game FIFA 08."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"Big Pimpin'\" is the fifth and final single from rapper Jay-Z's fourth album Vol. 3... Life and Times of S. Carter. It features rapping by Southern hip hop group UGK as well as production by Timbaland.The song by Jay-Z was based loosely around Tha Dogg Pound's major hit Big Pimpin', which was released in 1997. Timbaland samples \"Khosara Khosara\", composed by Baligh Hamdi of Egypt in the mid-20th century and originally recorded by the famous Egyptian vocalist Abdel Halim Hafez. The sampled version of \"Khosara Khosara\" was arranged and performed by Hossam Ramzy, and can be heard on a CD compilation entitled, \"The Best of Bellydance from Egypt, Lebanon, Turkey\", an album that also contains another song that Timbaland sampled for the Petey Pablo track, \"Raise Up\". In 2007, the song sparked controversy when copyright co-owner Osama Ahmed Fahmy filed a lawsuit in Los Angeles Federal Court, alleging that Timbaland illegally replayed portions of \"Khosara Khosara\" note-for-note. Jay-Z, Timbaland, Linkin Park and EMI Music Inc. were among the defendants named in the lawsuit. (Linkin Park was included because the track was also mashed up with their song \"Papercut\" on the collaborative EP Collision Course in 2004). The Linkin Park mash-up was entitled \"Big Pimpin/Papercut\". This latest lawsuit follows an August (2007) decision by a California judge to dismiss another lawsuit by Ahab Joseph Nafal, who claimed Big Pimpin' infringed the copyright on Khosara Khorasa. Lawyers for EMI Records argued the 50-year-old track was governed by the 1909 Copyright Act, AllHipHop.com reports. \"Big Pimpin'\" was the most commercially successful single from Jay-Z's fourth album, as it reached #18 on The Billboard Hot 100 and #1 on the Rhythmic Top 40 chart. In Rolling Stone's updated 2010 list of \"The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time\", the song ranked at #467. Despite the song's performance, Jay-Z later revealed he regretted the song's lyrics claiming that, \"Some [lyrics] become really profound when you see them in writing. Not \"Big Pimpin.\" That's the exception. It was like, I can't believe I said that. And kept saying it. What kind of animal would say this sort of thing? Reading it is really harsh.\" Katy Perry covered the song during her 2011/12 California Dreams Tour. The cast of The Big Bang Theory made a flashmob during the live taping of an episode, featuring the song as well as others."@en ;

dbr:Days_of_Wild	rdf:type	dbo:MusicalWork ;
	dbo:abstract	"\"Days of Wild\" is a song by Prince and The New Power Generation. It was written by Prince in early 1994 after his name change to an unpronounceable symbol. The song is regarded[citation needed] as one of Prince's first legitimate successes at rapping and is both an ode to and criticism of gangsta rap. Strong language and cursing is used throughout the track, but it ultimately elevates women with lyrics such as \"A woman everyday should be thanked, not disrespected, not raped or spanked\". \"Days of Wild\" is pure funk, relying heavily on bass guitar as well as the organ and samplers to create an infectious groove. \"Days of Wild\" was premiered live in concert in February 1994 along with other new material to promote Prince's new on-stage persona, performing all new material. Shortly thereafter, the studio version of this song and others were played as a promotion on European radio stations and began circulating among collectors. \"Days of Wild\" became a crowd favorite at concerts, despite it never being officially released. The song was originally to be released on 1995's The Gold Experience but ended up being pulled for unknown reasons. Comments by Prince and associates suggest that he may have simply been dissatisfied with the studio version, which pales in comparison to live performances. A live performance of the song (an edited version of a performance from August 5th 1995) was eventually broadcast on a VH1 special segment of Prince videos in 1996. It was also played at Paisley Park on December 9th 1995 and this particular version was eventually released on the 1998 Crystal Ball 3-CD set. Sometime after this point, Prince's mentor and spiritual guide, Larry Graham influenced him to eliminate cursing from his music and change the lyrics of older songs to fit in with his new morality. By 1998, Prince had revised the lyrics of \"Days of Wild\" in concert to eliminate the profanity. During the 2000 \"Celebration\" concert at the University of Minnesota, Prince even scolded the audience (\"We don't do that no more!\") when it began the \"Play that motherfuckin' bass!\" chant associated with concert performances of the song. A live performance from a 2002 concert in Montreal was released as a single on June 30 of the same year. Many have said that the cleaner lyrics dull the edge of the original track, of which the studio version still remains unreleased. The B-side to the single is a live version of \"1+1+1 is 3\", a track from The Rainbow Children that was performed on the same tour and included on the live box set, One Nite Alone... Live!.

	dbo:abstract	"\"Give Me Just a Little More Time\" is the debut single for Chairmen of the Board, released in 1970 through Capitol Records on Holland\u2013Dozier\u2013Holland's Invictus Records label. The song was written and produced by Brian Holland, Lamont Dozier, Edward Holland, Jr., and Ron Dunbar. Because of the then still-pending lawsuit against Holland-Dozier-Holland from their former employers, Motown, the trio credited themselves with the pseudonym \"Edythe Wayne\" for this song and many other early Invictus/Hot Wax releases. \"Give Me Just a Little More Time\" features Chairmen of the Board lead singer General Johnson as the narrator, begging a lover who rejected him to reconsider and give him \"just a little more time\". The song was very similar to a Motown recording in more ways than one. Not only was it written and produced by Holland-Dozier-Holland, but the instrumental track was performed by members of The Funk Brothers, Motown's in-house band. \"Give Me Just a Little More Time\", backed with \"Since the Days of Pigtails\", peaked at number three on the Billboard Hot 100 in the United States, making it the best-performing of the Chairmen's singles, and the first of the Chairmen's four Billboard Hot 100 Top 40 pop hits. The single also peaked at number-eight on the Billboard R&B Singles chart. It reached number three in the UK Singles Chart in September 1970, having already sold more than one million copies in the US. The first Chairmen of the Board LP, a self-titled release, included the single; after the single's success, the Chairmen of the Board album was reissued as Give Me Just a Little More Time. In 1982, American R&B singer Angela Clemmons remade the song and it peaked at #4 on Billboard's Hot Dance MusicClub Play Singles chart."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"Hot Love\" is a 1990 single by British pop group Five Star, the second release for their new record label, Epic. Peaking at #68, this track would be the group's last appearance in the UK Top 75 to date. The group recorded the single in their new hi-tech studio that was built in the grounds of their family home, Stone Court, in Ascot, Berkshire. The single proved a flop, and the press were quick to pounce, claiming Five Star's career was rapidly fading, and that they had lost all their money, a claim they refuted when they appeared on BBC TV's Wogan chat show in an attempt to prove to the public that they were, in fact, quite happy, and that they had kept their fortunes from their previous hits. They then performed \"Hot Love\" on the show, many fans screaming and shouting their support for the band throughout the performance. After the single's release, the album Five Star, was shelved by Epic, and merited only a U.S. release, although the album was made available in Britain on import towards the end of 1990. After a third single, \"Shine\" (released in 1991) failed, only making #53 in the UK, the band left Epic and pursued a career in the United States. The video to the single was hardly shown on British TV, perhaps the media thought that interest in Five Star had come to an end. The video was shot in a mock coffee shop called \"Joe's Bar\", in which the band performed a dance routine, not dissimilar to that of Michael Jackson's moonwalk.

In addition, the song won both a Golden Globe and an Academy Award for Best Original Song. The song also received three nominations at the 27th Grammy Awards for Best Male Pop Vocal Performance, Song of the Year and Best Pop Instrumental Performance. There was a dispute among Wonder, his former writing partner Lee Garrett, and Lloyd Chiate as to who actually wrote the song. Chiate claimed in a lawsuit that he and Garrett wrote the song years before its 1984 release; however a jury ultimately sided with Wonder."@en ;

Drum machines, sequencing and programming were provided by producer Martin Rushent and his then Engineer and Programmer David M. Allen. One of the most notable synth sounds on the recording makes use of the pitch-to-voltage converter and envelope shaper on the Roland System 700 modular synth. Jo Callis' guitar strumming was fed into the synth and used to shape and trigger the sounds, producing an unusual choppy, strumming synth patch.

	dbo:abstract	"\"Say You'll Be There\" is a song by English girl group Spice Girls. It was co-written by the Spice Girls with Jonathan Buck and Eliot Kennedy, for their debut album Spice (1996). Production duo Absolute incorporated a mix of pop and R&B into the song, which includes a harmonica solo, played by Judd Lander. The lyrics\u2014which described the things the group have been through together and how they always have been there for each other\u2014received mixed reviews from critics, who described them as \"confusing\" and felt that the R&B-infused production was a \"bid for street cred\". The song has also been covered by Danish singer-songwriter M\u00D8 which also gained popularity. The music video was inspired by the films Faster, Pussycat! Kill! Kill! (1965) and Pulp Fiction (1994), and features the group as a band of female techno-warriors, who use martial arts and high-tech ninja influenced weapons to capture a hapless male. It includes symbols of male disempowerment, and serves as an example of solidarity and the group's bonding. It received positive reactions from fans and was nominated for numerous awards including the 1996 Smash Hits! Awards, the 1997 MTV Video Music Awards, and the 1997 BRIT Awards. Released as the album's second single on 14 October 1996, it became their second number-one single in the United Kingdom, and was certified platinum by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI). It was a commercial success across Europe, reaching the top ten in most of the charts that it entered. As a result of its popularity, the song was released in 1997 in Australia, receiving a gold certification by the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA), and in North America, entering the top five in both, Canada and the United States."@en ;

The song is a popular and enduring example of the dance-song genre: much of the lyrics are devoted to a description of the dance itself, usually done as a type of line dance.

The video is composed of many colourful auroras and seems to be in a space setting. It can be noted that Daniel Johns was sitting in a chair for a few shots. During the period in which this video was shot, John's reactive arthritis was worsening, and he could barely walk let alone play a guitar."@en ;

Like the first single \"Don't Lose Touch\", it was released exclusively on twelve-inch vinyl with a remixed version of the song as the A-side and the album version as the B-side. The A-side version was remixed by Ad-Rock of the Beastie Boys. The single was limited to 3,185 copies. The lyrics of the song address then-United States Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice on the subject of the Iraq War, with lines such as \"After all this death and destruction, do you really think your actions advocate freedom?\" and \"Condoleezza, what are we gonna do now?\" The music video for \"From Her Lips to God's Ears (The Energizer)\" depicts a fantasy world analogous to that of The Wizard of Oz. A young girl with the head of a rabbit, after watching news footage of Condoleezza Rice defending the United States' police actions in the Iraq War, sets out along a yellow brick road in search of Rice. Along the way she is joined by two men, one with the head of a pig and the other with the head of a chicken, both of whom are also seeking Rice. The trio arrive at a palace in which they find an animatronic puppet with Rice's televised face, to which they pose the question \"What are we gonna do now?\" The question confounds and overloads the puppet, and the trio escape as it and the building collapse and explode."@en ;

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hello,_Goodbye>	rdf:type	dbo:MusicalWork ;
	dbo:abstract	"\"Hello, Goodbye\" is a song by the English rock band the Beatles, written by Paul McCartney and credited to Lennon\u2013McCartney. Backed by John Lennon's \"I Am the Walrus\", it was issued as a non-album single in November 1967, the group's first release since the death of their manager, Brian Epstein. The single was commercially successful around the world, topping charts in the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia and several other countries. McCartney later said that the lyrics take duality as their theme. The song originated when, in response to a question from Beatles aide Alistair Taylor about songwriting, McCartney sat down at a harmonium and asked Taylor to say the opposite of whatever he said. The completed song includes a musical coda, which was improvised by the Beatles when they were recording the track in October 1967. Unimpressed with the composition, Lennon pushed for \"I Am the Walrus\" to be the single's A-side, but McCartney and the band's producer, George Martin, opted for the more commercial-sounding \"Hello, Goodbye\". The Beatles produced three promotional films for the song, one of which was shown on The Ed Sullivan Show in America. Due to regulations against lip-syncing in Britain, none of the clips were aired there. \"Hello, Goodbye\" has traditionally received a varied response from music critics. While some reviewers praise the song for its classic pop qualities, others deem it unadventurous by the Beatles' standards and inconsequential. The track was included on the expanded US release of the Magical Mystery Tour soundtrack EP, and later appeared on compilation albums such as 1967\u20131970 and 1. McCartney has often performed \"Hello, Goodbye\" in concert, beginning with his Driving World Tour in 2002. James Last, Bud Shank, Allen Toussaint, the Cure and the cast of Glee are among the acts who have also recorded the song."@en ;

dbr:Light_of_a_Clear_Blue_Morning	rdf:type	dbo:MusicalWork ;
	dbo:abstract	"\"Light of a Clear Blue Morning\" is a song written and recorded by American entertainer Dolly Parton. It first appeared on her 1977 New Harvest... First Gathering album, and provided a top twenty country music hit for her as a single. As Parton has told a number of interviewers over the years, the song came out of the pain from her break with longtime musical and business partner Porter Wagoner. Parton left Wagoner's band in 1974, in an effort to aim her career in a more mainstream pop direction; Wagoner responded by taking legal action, and the next couple of years were reportedly painful for both performers. According to the unauthorized 1978 biography, Dolly, by Alanna Nash, \"Light of a Clear Blue Morning\" was written as Parton felt the figurative clouds lifting, as the fruits of her sacrifices of the previous few years were becoming apparent. Released as a single from New Harvest - First Gathering in February 1977, the song just missed the top ten on the U.S. country charts, peaking at number 11. Parton would rerecord the song to include in her 1992 film Straight Talk; for this recording, she changed the lyrics of verse two. A third recording of it appeared on an album of spirituals Parton released in 2003 entitled For God and Country. Glen Campbell covered the song on his 1991 album Unconditional Love."@en ;

Produced by Jackson and Rodney \"Darkchild\" Jerkins and written by Jackson, Jerkins, Fred Jerkins III, LaShawn Daniels and Nora Payne, the song is musically a disco-pop song with influences from Jackson's songs from his previous studio albums with Quincy Jones. The song received mixed reviews from music critics, with reviewers commenting that Jackson could have made a better effort for it and that it was not his best material, while other reviewers generally praised the song's composition and Jackson's vocal performance. \"You Rock My World\" was commercially successful worldwide and peaked at number ten on the Billboard Hot 100, becoming Jackson's first top ten song in the United States in over six years, and his last in the country until \"Love Never Felt So Good\" (a duet with Justin Timberlake) hit number 9 in 2014. This success was achieved on airplay alone, as the song was not released as a commercial single in the United States. \"You Rock My World\" topped the French music chart for three consecutive weeks. It also reached the top ten in Australia, Austrian, Canada, Danish, Finnish, Italian, Swedish, Swiss and the United Kingdom music charts. As part of promotion for the song, a music video was released. The video, which is thirteen and a half minutes long, was directed by Paul Hunter and features Chris Tucker. In the video, Jackson and Tucker portray men who are trying to gain a woman's affection. The video has been compared to Jackson's previous videos \"Smooth Criminal\" and \"The Way You Make Me Feel\" and has received mixed reviews. The song was performed only twice by Jackson; at Madison Square Garden in New York City at two concerts in September 2001 to celebrate Jackson's career as a solo artist. Footage of the performance was shown in the two-hour CBS television special, Michael Jackson: 30th Anniversary Special. The track was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Male Pop Vocal Performance at the 44th Grammy Awards. \"You Rock My World\" has sold 6 million copies worldwide."@en ;

The song was written and produced by Nate Hills, Tim Mosley, and Timberlake himself. Discussing \"SexyBack\", Timberlake revealed that he went \"left\", singing the song in a rock style, not an R&B style. He described the song as musicians David Bowie and David Byrne \"covering\" James Brown's 1970 song \"Sex Machine\". The track features Timbaland on backing vocals, while Timberlake's voice is distorted. The instrumentation used in the song includes a pounding bass beat, electronic chords, and drum machine sounds. Despite mixed critical reviews, \"SexyBack\" became Timberlake's first number-one single on the Billboard Hot 100, staying seven weeks at the top spot. It also topped several of Billboard magazine's other charts, including the Billboard Pop 100, Hot Dance Airplay, and Hot Digital Songs charts, and entered the top ten on most singles charts. Internationally, it became Timberlake's first single to reach number one in the United Kingdom. In Australia, the track was Timberlake's second number-one single, spending two consecutive weeks at the top. \"SexyBack\" was certified three-times platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) and three-times platinum by Canadian Recording Industry Association (CRIA). The track won Best Dance Recording at the 2007 Grammy Awards. In addition, the song won Timberlake the People's Choice Award for Favorite R&B song and the Male Artist of the Year at the 2007 MTV Video Music Awards. The music video was filmed in June 2006; Timberlake decided to work with director Michael Haussman based on the latter's work on Madonna's 1994 music video \"Take a Bow\"."@en ;

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/This_Guitar_(Can\u0027t_Keep_from_Crying)>	rdf:type	dbo:MusicalWork ;
	dbo:abstract	"\"This Guitar (Can't Keep from Crying)\" is a song by English musician George Harrison, released on his 1975 studio album Extra Texture (Read All About It). Harrison wrote the song as a sequel to his popular Beatles composition \"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\", in response to the personal criticism he had received during and after his 1974 North American tour with Ravi Shankar, particularly from Rolling Stone magazine. \"This Guitar\" was issued as a single in December 1975 \u2013 the final release for Apple Records in its original incarnation \u2013 but it failed to chart in either the United States or Britain. The song follows in a tradition established by singers such as Woody Guthrie and Pete Seeger, of attributing emotions and actions to a musical instrument. The lyrics also serve as an example of a dialogue that was commonplace during the 1970s between songwriters and music critics. Contributing to Harrison's sense of injustice in \"This Guitar\", he and his tour musicians believed that detractors had ignored the successful aspects of the 1974 shows \u2013 which blended rock, jazz, funk and Indian classical music \u2013 and had focused instead on his failure to pay due respect to the legacy of the Beatles. Rolling Stone's scathing assessment of Harrison's tour and accompanying album, Dark Horse, represented an about-face by the publication, previously one of his most vocal supporters, and led to Harrison's continued resentment towards the magazine over subsequent decades. Harrison recorded \"This Guitar (Can't Keep from Crying)\" in Los Angeles during April and May 1975, a period marked by his post-tour despondency. The recording features guitar solos played by Harrison and American musician Jesse Ed Davis. The song serves as a rare guitar-oriented selection on the keyboard-heavy Extra Texture album, although David Foster, Gary Wright and Harrison all contributed keyboard parts to the track. \"This Guitar\" has traditionally received a mixed reception from reviewers, partly due to the inevitable comparisons with \"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\". Harrison re-recorded the song in 1992 with former Eurythmic Dave Stewart, who used it to promote his Platinum Weird project in 2006. This version appears as a bonus track on the 2014 Apple Years 1968\u201375 reissue of Extra Texture."@en ;

Charting together with \"Super Music Maker\", the physical single reached number 32 on the Japanese Oricon Singles Chart, where it has spent two weeks. \"Free Free\" sold over 10,000 units in Japan; this marks her highest-selling recording since 2006 and her last single to date to reach this limit.

	dbo:abstract	"\"Now That You Got It\" is a song by American singer and songwriter Gwen Stefani from her second solo studio album, The Sweet Escape (2006). Stefani co-wrote the song with its producers Sean Garrett and Swizz Beatz. \"Now That You Got It\" is a reggae song featuring hip hop beats, stacatto piano sample and military snare drums. Lyrically, the song places Gwen asking her lover to give all that she wants. A remix featuring Damian Marley was produced for the song's release as the album's fourth single on August 27, 2007 by Interscope Records. The original solo version received mixed reviews from music critics, with some praising its catchiness, while others calling it repetitive. However, the remix version was more praised, being called \"a laid back, summery tune\". Commercially, the single experienced very little success, reaching the top-forty in six countries, while failing to gain impact in the United States and the United Kingdom. The song's music video was directed by The Saline Project and was shot in Puerto Rico and Jamaica, featuring Stefani and the Harajuku Girls. The song was performed during The Sweet Escape Tour."@en ;

Written jointly by lead singer Philip Oakey and keyboard player Ian Burden, the song was recorded at Genetic Sound Studios, Reading, in March 1981. Originally released as a stand-alone single in April 1981, it was subsequently re-recorded and incorporated into the studio album Dare, later in the year. \"The Sound Of The Crowd\" was the first Human League song to feature female vocals, from new band members Susan Ann Sulley and Joanne Catherall, interacting with Philip Oakey's baritone lead. The single was the first to feature a distinctive, though short-lived, marketing tactic, where Human League singles were labelled 'Red' or 'Blue' to help buyers differentiate between the band's musical styles. 'Red' was for dance tracks, 'Blue' for pop songs. \"The Sound Of The Crowd\" was designated 'Red'.

The song was written by Hamasaki herself, while production was handled by long-time collaborator Max Matsuura and Tsunku. The song was written by Hamasaki while she was still in promotion of her previous studio album A Song for \u00D7\u00D7 (1999) and in production of the then-forthcoming album Loveppears. The b-side \"Love: Since 1999\" became her second song to incorporate English lyrics since the previous single \"Whatever\" despite not written by Hamasaki. There are two versions; \"Love (Destiny)\" and \"Love (Refrain)\". The first incorporates pop music and ballad music, that talks about a relationship with themes of love, while the latter incorporates R&B and pop music. The title track was specially commissioned to be a sub-theme for the drama series SemiDouble. The accompanying music video for the single was directed by Wataru Takeishi, who directed all her A Song for xx and Loveppears music videos since the start off her career and hows Hamasaki recording songs, writing lyrics, facing her fans, and singing against a night sky. The song achieved favorable reception from most music critics, who praised Hamasaki's vocal abilities and lyrical content. Critics also praised the content and the single version, while critics had dismissed the album version and composition. Commercially, \"Love (Destiny)\" became a huge success in her native Japan, becoming her first number-one single on the Oricon chart. The song was re-released in February 2001 and was certified double platinum by Recording Industry Association of Japan (RIAJ). The song has been performed on several events including Hey! Hey!

AllMusic journalist Donald A. Guarisco described the song in a retrospective review, as being \"a lilting epic\".

Jones' verse didn't make it to iTunes' remix, although Lil Wayne's verse and Chamillionaire's verse did. Another unofficial remix has been produced by Lil Jon and the Swedish composer Jay Orpin, who also wrote the first remix, but had Lil' Jon make changes for the beat for this remix. That remix has been unofficially called the Orpinz Old Duff WWE Remix because some feel it resembles a professional wrestlers entrance music. There is also a freestyle version by J. R.

It's not so bad being poor when you've got your family and God in your life and you have different values that, when it comes down to it, matter. A lot of other things really don't matter when God is knocking at your door.\" Po' Folks was released in 2002 and taken from Nappy Roots's debut album, Watermelon, Chicken & Gritz.

It charted in Australia peaking #2 and stayed 4 weeks there. Later it was a hit charting #10 on the Canadian RPM chart, # 15 in the United States and #7 in the Netherlands. The song has been covered by many punk rock and heavy metal bands. This song is noted for its Indian riff, played by an electric guitar as well as a violin. It is also distinctive for its introduction featuring a heavily distorted guitar's tremolo descent from E to D. This somewhat autobiographical song told about Burdon's father, who was a soldier during tough times, as well as young Eric's adventures including his first smoke of a cigarette at 10, to his meeting his first love at 13. The final verse shows his disillusionment with society by saying: \"My faith was so much stronger then,/I believed in fellow men,/And I was so much older then./When I was Young\".

	dbo:abstract	"\"Young Savage\" is the second single by Ultravox!. It was released as a single by Island Records on 28 May 1977, during a time of experimentation to define a new sound for the band, in advance of their second album. The song was made in a punk style, although the band denied it was a 'punk' song, pointing out that Billy Currie's keyboard playing is in a psychedelic style. It's their first release from the Ha!-Ha!-Ha! sessions, and is notably different from the material on their first album Ultravox!, which had more glam songs. A definitive song in the band's development, and a popular single at the time, the 2006 reissue edition of the latter album (IMCD 325) contains it as bonus track.'Young Savage' was also improbably named as record of the week on Mark & Lard's Radio 1 show in 2002. The B-Side of 'Young Savage' is a live version of \"Slip Away\", recorded during a gig at The Rainbow in London in 1977. 'Young Savage' is one of four live tracks featured on the Retro EP (IEP 8), released on 10 February 1978. This performance was recorded at the Marquee in London.The live version as featured on the 'Retro EP' is also one of the bonus tracks on the 2006 edition of Ha!-Ha!-Ha!. 'Young Savage' was a regular feature of Ultravox live shows and was included in the set performed on their last tour with John Foxx in the USA during February and March 1979.The song was not performed live again until a new version was played by John Foxx as part of his live set with Louis Gordon in Japan during September 2008 and for the first time in the UK for thirty years at Cargo in London on 16 October 2008. The song was featured in the film Awaydays and also accompanies its trailer. On BBC 6 Music, 13 December 2013, Brett Anderson and Mat Osman of Suede chose the song as one of their playlist; Brett described it as 'really exciting - glammy, pinky, violent.'"@en ;

It was released on 22 June 2008 and features guest vocals from Scottish DJ Calvin Harris and English R&B singer Chrome. The extended mix of the song also appears on Harris's second album, Ready for the Weekend. \"Dance wiv Me\" mixes Rascal's usual grime style with dance music from Harris and R&B from Chrome. Rascal and Harris recorded their respective verse and main hook parts separately, sending their parts back and forth over the phone, while Chrome recorded the pre hook/bridge vocals in the studio with Rascal. The song was produced by Harris and he also sings the chorus. However, Harris rarely sings on releases any more and is usually seen as a DJ. The song debuted in the UK at #1 and stayed there for four weeks - making it Rascal's first ever number one. It became the 12th-biggest selling single in the UK in 2008. Rascal, Chrome and Harris performed an impromptu acoustic version of \"Dance wiv Me\" for the BBC as part of the Glastonbury Festival 2008 coverage.

	dbo:abstract	"\"(Don't Go Back To) Rockville\" was the second and final single released by R.E.M. from their second studio album Reckoning. The song failed to chart on either the Billboard Hot 100 or the UK Singles Charts. The song was written by Mike Mills (credited to Berry/Buck/Mills/Stipe) as a plea to his then girlfriend, Ingrid Schorr, not to return to Rockville, Maryland, where her parents lived. Schorr, who later became a journalist, has written about her amusement with the factual inaccuracies about her relationship with Mills and the background of the song that often appear in books about the band. Peter Buck has stated that the song was originally performed in a punk/thrash style, and that it was recorded for this single in its now more-familiar country-inspired arrangement as a joke aimed at R.E.M. manager Bertis Downs. Over time, Mike Mills has taken lead vocals instead of Michael Stipe. On R.E.M.'s appearance on VH1 Storytellers in 1998, Mills performed the song solo on piano. A live version of the song was released as the B-side to \"Leaving New York\" in 2004 and on R.E.M. Live in 2007."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"As\" is a song written and performed by Stevie Wonder from his 1976 album, Songs in the Key of Life. It reached #36 on both the Billboard Hot 100 and Black Singles chart. The song implies that the love the singer has for the object of his love will never diminish by saying he will love until the physically impossible becomes true. The impossible feats include: rainbows burning the stars out in the sky, oceans covering the tops of every mountain, dolphins flying, and parrots living at sea, dreaming of life and life becoming a dream, day becoming night and vice versa, trees and the seas flying away, 8\u00D78\u00D78 equaling 4, this day becoming the last day, the Earth turning right to left, the Earth denying itself, Mother Nature saying her work is through, and \"until the day that you are me and I am you\". One interpretation is that this is a lover singing to his mate. Another interpretation is the song is about the endless unconditional love the Judeo-Christian tradition God has for the listener and the singers part in that. A third interpretation is that it is about the singer's unconditional love for humanity. The verse that begins with \"We all know sometimes life's hates and troubles...\" would seem to preclude the first interpretation, and favor the third over the second. The song gets its name from the first word of the song."@en ;

It peaked at number eleven on the UK Singles Chart. The single was sub-titled \"Strangely Limited Edition\" due to the 12\" vinyl record being deleted after two weeks. This was to move the focus over to the release of the debut album, Experience, following a few weeks later. Even when the single was re-released, the subtitle was still standing. \"Fire\" uses the sample \"I am the god of Hell fire, and I bring you (fire)\" from The Crazy World of Arthur Brown's 1968 single of the same name. The \"fire\" vocal sample following \"...I bring you\" is taken from Daddy Freddy's \"Live Jam\". It takes the sampled vocal \"When I was a youth I used to burn collie weed in a Rizla\" from the track \"Hard Times\" by Pablo Gad. \"Jericho\" uses an interpolation of the distinct melody in \"Kunta Kinte\" by the Revolutionaries. A video was directed by frequent collaborator Russell Curtis, but the band didn't like the result and it remained unreleased at the time. The video did however turn up on a compilation from XL called The Video Chapter. Due to its rarity, this video has been much sought after by fans.

It also became a top five hit in Belgium, Ireland, the Netherlands, and Switzerland. The single was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) on October 25, 2004. When the single reached number one on Billboard's Pop Songs chart, JoJo became, at age 13, the youngest solo artist to have a number-one single in the United States. JoJo has expressed her displeasure with the song, and most of her self-titled album, for its overall pop sound. However, she is grateful that it put her on the musical map. When she would perform the song at her most recent concerts, she would arrange it to the point of being almost unrecognizable, adding jazzier instrumentation to the verses and heavier guitars or double-kick drumming to the bridge. The song appears in the 2004 PlayStation 2 karaoke game Karaoke Revolution Volume 3.

It has become a standard in pop and rock, with hundreds of versions recorded by different artists. The song was originally written and performed in the style of a Jamaican ballad. It tells, in simple verse\u2013chorus form, the first-person story of a Jamaican sailor returning to the island to see his lady love. The Kingsmen's edition was the subject of an FBI investigation about the supposed but nonexistent obscenity of the lyrics, an investigation that ended without prosecution. Ironically, the song notably includes the drummer yelling \"Fuck!\" after dropping his drumstick at the 0:54 mark. \"Louie Louie\" has been recognized by organizations and publications worldwide for its influence on the history of rock and roll. A partial list (see \"Recognition and rankings\" table below) includes the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, the Grammy Hall of Fame, National Public Radio, VH1, Rolling Stone, the National Endowment for the Arts, and the Recording Industry Association of America. In addition to new versions appearing regularly on YouTube and elsewhere, other major examples of the song's legacy include the unsuccessful attempt in 1985 to make it the state song of Washington, the celebration of International Louie Louie Day every year on April 11, the annual Louie Louie Parade in Philadelphia from 1985 to 1989, the LouieFest in Tacoma from 2003 to 2012, and the ongoing annual Louie Louie Parade and Festival in Peoria."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"Love Story\" is a song performed by American singer-songwriter Taylor Swift. The song was written by Swift and produced by Nathan Chapman, alongside Swift. It was released on September 12, 2008 by Big Machine Records, as the lead single from Swift's second studio album Fearless (2008). The song was written about a love interest of Swift's who was not popular among Swift's family and friends. Because of the scenario, Swift related to the plot of William Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet (1597) and used it as a source of inspiration to compose the song. However, she replaced Romeo and Juliet's original tragic conclusion with a happy ending. It is a midtempo song with a dreamy soprano voice, while the melody continually builds. The lyrics are from the perspective of Juliet. The song was a critical success with critics complimenting Swift's writing style and the song's plot. It was also a commercial success, selling over 8 million copies worldwide, therefore establishing itself among the best-selling singles of all time. In the United States, the song peaked at number four on the Billboard Hot 100 and sold over 5.8 million paid digital downloads, becoming Swift's best-selling single to date and the best-selling download by a female country solo artist. It is also one of the best-selling singles in the United States and was once the best-selling digital country single of all time there. The single was certified 8\u00D7 Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). Internationally, \"Love Story\" became Swift's first number one single in Australia, followed by \"Shake It Off\" in 2014. The song has been certified triple platinum by the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA). The song is one of the best-selling singles worldwide, with worldwide sales of more than 8 millions of units (according to the IFPI). The song's accompanying music video was directed by Trey Fanjoy, who directed the majority of Swift's prior videos. The video is a period piece that drew influences from the Medieval, Renaissance, and British Regency (1813) eras. It follows Swift and model Justin Gaston as they meet in a university campus and imagine themselves in a prior era. \"Love Story\" was promoted through numerous live performances. The song was included on Swift's first, second, third, and fourth headlining tours, the Fearless Tour (2009\u201310), the Speak Now World Tour (2011\u201312), the Red Tour (2013\u201314), and the 1989 World Tour (2015) respectively. \"Love Story\" has been covered by several artists, including Joe McElderry and Forever the Sickest Kids."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"Primary\" is the only single from The Cure's third studio album Faith, released in 1981 on Fiction Records. It was the first song by The Cure to be remixed as a separate extended mix for release on 12\" single (and not co-released on other formats, in the way the 12\" version of A Forest was also the album version appearing on Seventeen Seconds, for example). In fact, the original 12\" extended mix is, to this day, still only available on the original 12\" single, which has never been reproduced on any other album, making it quite a rare item. The main difference between the 7\" mix (also the album mix), and 12\" mix is that the extended mix lengthens the instrumental introductions to the song's verses. The song is unusual in that both Simon Gallup and Robert Smith play bass, with the effects pedals on Smith's giving the leads a unique sound.

dbr:Strawberry_Fields_Forever	rdf:type	dbo:MusicalWork ;
	dbo:abstract	"\"Strawberry Fields Forever\" is a song by the English rock band the Beatles. The song was written by John Lennon and credited to the Lennon\u2013McCartney songwriting partnership. It was inspired by Lennon's memories of playing in the garden of Strawberry Field, a Salvation Army children's home near where he grew up in Liverpool. The song was the first track recorded during the sessions for the Beatles' Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band (1967), and was intended for inclusion on the album. Instead, with the group under record-company pressure to release a single, it was issued in February 1967 as a double A-side with \"Penny Lane\". The combination reached number two in the United Kingdom, breaking the band's four-year run of chart-topping singles there, while \"Strawberry Fields Forever\" peaked at number eight on the Billboard Hot 100 in America. Numerous music critics consider it to be one of the group's best and most adventurous recordings. Among the breakthroughs it established in studio techniques of the time, for a single release, the track incorporates reverse-recorded instrumentation and tape loops, and was created from the editing together of two separate versions of the song \u2013 each one entirely different in tempo, mood and musical key. The song was later included on the US Magical Mystery Tour LP (although not on the British double EP package of the same name). \"Strawberry Fields Forever\" is one of the defining works of the psychedelic rock genre and has been covered by many artists. The Beatles made a promotional film clip for the song that is similarly recognised for its influence in the medium of music video. The Strawberry Fields memorial in New York's Central Park is named after the song."@en ;

It was recorded by Lauper for her debut studio album, She's So Unusual (1983), with Rob Hyman (co-writer), contributing backing vocals. The track was produced by Rick Chertoff and released as a single on January 27, 1984. It was the second single to be released from the album and became Lauper's first #1 hit in the U.S. The song was written in the album's final stages, after \"Girls Just Wanna Have Fun\", \"She Bop\" and \"All Through the Night\" had been written. The writing began with the title, which Lauper had seen in TV Guide magazine, referring to the 1979 science fiction film Time After Time. \"Time After Time\" is composed of simple keyboard-synth chords, bright, jangly guitars, clock-ticking percussion, and elastic bassline, and lyrically it's a love song of devotion. Most music critics gave the song positive reviews, with most commending the song for being a solid and memorable love song, as well as considering the track Lauper's best song. The song has been selected as one of the Best Love Songs of All Time by many media outlets, including Rolling Stone, Nerve, MTV and many others. \"Time After Time\" was also nominated for a Grammy Award for Song of the Year at the 1985 edition. The song was a success on the charts, becoming her first number-one single on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 chart on June 9, 1984 and remaining there for two weeks. Worldwide, the song is her most commercially successful single, after \"Girls Just Want to Have Fun\", and reached number three on the UK Singles Chart and number six on the ARIA Singles Chart. The song is also known for its numerous covers by a wide range of artists, including Miles Davis, who recorded an instrumental version for his 1985 album, You're Under Arrest, and Eva Cassidy, whose cover of the song appears on her posthumous album of the same name. R&B singer Lil Mo also covered the song for her 2001 debut album Based on a True Story. An acoustic version was sung by Lauper with Sarah McLachlan on her 2005 album, The Body Acoustic. Lauper has performed the song live with Patti LaBelle twice in 1985 and 2004 and with Sarah McLachlan at the American Music Awards of 2005, as well as with rapper Lil' Kim in 2009."@en ;

Mute Records released it in Europe as the album's third single, and Sire Records released it in the United States as the album's second single. It is a classic Erasure synthpop song written by members Vince Clarke and Andy Bell. One of the band's signature songs, the duo still perform it regularly in concert. An uplifting love song, the instrumentation is crisp and heavily synthesized, accented with sweeping, programmed piano. The music video shows Clarke and Bell performing the song in a large, white room, which gets painted blue as the video progresses. A blue hand holds a paint brush in view, and the camera follows the hand as it paints Clarke and a shirtless Bell until they both are completely blue. Eventually gold-colored leaves, similar to those featured on the Wild! album cover, blow in and cover the duo as they perform. \"Blue Savannah\" became one of Erasure's most successful singles, peaking at number three on the UK singles chart. It also returned the band to the Top 20 in Germany, where the song hit number thirteen. The release of the single brought about the usual array of remixes and B-sides. Although several club mixes of \"Blue Savannah\" were issued commercially, the Shep Pettibone 'Out of the Blue' mix proved to be most popular in dance clubs. This remix, available only on promotional copies of the 12 inch single, was never officially released and fetches a premium from collectors on trading sites such as eBay. Compact disc versions of the promotional single which contain the 'Out of the Blue' remix are even rarer. In 2004, HiBias Records of Canada started their Retro:Active - Rare & Remixed CD series and the 'Out of the Blue' Mix received its first official release, on volume one. In Leamington Spa, Warwickshire, the song is often played at the end of music nights across the town as a finale. \"Blue Savannah\" was the inspiration for the song \"Escribeme en el Cielo\" three years later by the Mexican group Sentidos Opuestos, which is strikingly similar in its instrumental arrangements and melody.[citation needed]"@en ;

It was released on December 2, 2008, by Jive Records as the second single from the album. Written by Dr. Luke, Claude Kelly and Benny Blanco, \"Circus\" is a metaphor for the public's perception of Spears' life. After she listened to the track for the first time, she felt inspired to create an album and a tour with a circus theme. \"Circus\" is an uptempo electropop and dance-pop song with elements of pop rock and \"half-rapped\" vocals. The song's lyrics talk about being an entertainer and putting on shows. \"Circus\" was well received by contemporary critics, with reviewers complimenting Spears' confident persona and praising the song's electronic production. \"Circus\" was a commercial success, peaking inside the top-ten in Australia, Canada, Denmark, New Zealand, and Sweden, while reaching top-twenty positions in many European countries. In the United States, \"Circus\" reached number three on the Billboard Hot 100 and number one on Pop Songs and is her second best-selling digital song in the country, having sold over 3.1 million copies. The music video, directed by Francis Lawrence, was released on December 4, 2008. It portrays Spears as the ringmaster of a circus accompanied by different performers, and it is interspersed with scenes of Spears in different circus settings. The video received positive reviews from critics, but was criticized by PETA for featuring \"cruelly trained animals\". However, the exhibitors denied these claims. Spears performed the song on Good Morning America on December 2, 2008. It was also the opening number of The Circus Starring Britney Spears (2009), where she was dressed in a ringleader outfit, designed to represent a metamorphosis. Spears has also performed the song during her residency concert Britney: Piece of Me. The song will appear in Just Dance 2016."@en ;

Two versions were released, CD and DVD. Included as CD-Extras on this single was a multimedia section containing 13 exclusive screensavers and 13 exclusive wallpapers. A special feature on the \"Colors\" DVD Single is the Kanzou-sensei Report, which is a mini-documentary showing the production that went into the DVD, as well as behind-the-scenes shots of Utada working. This single reached #1 on Oricon charts and charted for 45 weeks, her longest charting single ever. Though Kazuaki Kiriya was behind the art direction for the single, he did not take an active part as usual, with the single photography going to Kaoru Izima and the PV directing going to Donald Cameron. On the cover and the inside covers, there are drawings done by Utada herself (some designs include musical notation, the word 'yes' and a drawing of the Vatican). This single became the #3 single of 2003 in Japan. \"Colors\" had an extremely long performance season, which included 11 performances spanning over two months (except for the last performance, which was a special). This single reached #27 on World Charts for single airplay, and reached #6 for sales. The most recent figures (May 25, 2006) show that the single sold 893,790 units in total. The song featured heavy ethereal and experimental tones for the first time in Utada's discography. It became her longest charting single ever with a 45-week trajectory on the Oricon Singles chart, selling 881,000 copies, and was #3 on the Yearly Singles chart. \"Colors\" was performed during Utada's two date concert series Wild Life in December 2010."@en ;

The song's initial performance lasted around 11 minutes, slightly longer than its album version, and remained in that fashion in performances up to the present day.

The album version lasts 5 minutes and 24 seconds and the single version 3 minutes and 49 seconds. Originally it was entitled \"Get Down\", but this was changed before release, possibly to avoid confusion with the Gilbert O'Sullivan song of the same name.[citation needed] Towards the end of his life, DJ John Peel was known for playing \"Down Down\" as part of his eclectic DJ sets. In 1986 co-writer Bob Young released a country music style version of \"Down Down\" on his solo album In Quo Country. In July 2012, Status Quo reworked the lyrics to create a 3-minute promotional song for the Australian supermarket chain Coles. The chorus chants, \"down, down, prices are down\".

	dbo:abstract	"\"Longview\" is the debut single by the American punk rock band Green Day. It is the fourth track on the band's third album, Dookie and was released as the lead single. The song was the band's first single to top the Modern Rock chart in the U.S. The music video for this song received heavy airplay on MTV and is largely credited for breaking Green Day into mainstream popularity. The song describes intense boredom. Lyrically, the song is about a day spent sitting around the house, doing absolutely nothing of importance, masturbating, and smoking marijuana until the days are no longer fun. The song captured the attention of many youth at the time with its overt allusions to masturbation. Bassist Mike Dirnt has stated that the famous bass line intro to this song was written one night while he was high on LSD, and what remains on the album is what he and lead singer Billie Joe Armstrong could recall in the morning. At most shows in the 21st Century Breakdown World Tour, Billie Joe picked a random audience member to sing the song or play the song on electric guitar onstage. The song is named after the city of Longview, Washington, where it was first performed in 1992. The band had already written the song prior to arriving in the city. In 1995, Green Day received four Grammy Award nominations, including Best Hard Rock Performance for \"Longview\". The band won Best Alternative Music Performance for Dookie.Rolling Stone ranked it #3 on the list of Best Singles of 1994. The song can also be found on their 2001 greatest hits collection International Superhits!, and a live performance can be found on the Bullet in a Bible CD/DVD."@en ;

The song is in the similar musical vein as the bands US Billboard #1 single \"Every Rose Has Its Thorn\", in that it has a country rock vibe, except this song isn't a ballad and fuses elements of gospel music; \"Stand\" features the Los Angeles First A.M.E. Church Choir on backing vocals. The single's B-side, When The Whip Comes Down, hasn't featured on any Poison album to date. This is the only song released by the band not featuring the classic lineup that is still performed by the band in concert, however the song is performed relatively irregularly. An acoustic version of the song appears as a bonus track on the Japanese release of Richie Kotzen's Acoustic Cuts. It features different lyrics and an additional verse."@en ;

One of U2's most overtly political songs, its lyrics describe the horror felt by an observer of the Troubles in Northern Ireland, mainly focusing on the Bloody Sunday incident in Derry where British troops shot and killed unarmed civil rights protesters and bystanders who were there to rally against internment (imprisonment without trial), while at the same time rejecting hate and revenge as a response noted in the lyrics, \"There's many lost, but tell me who has won.\" Along with \"New Year's Day,\" the song helped U2 reach a wider listening audience. It was generally well received by critics on the album's release. The song has remained a staple of U2's live concerts. During its earliest performances, the song created controversy. Lead singer Bono reasserted the song's anti-sectarian-violence message to his audience for many years. Today, it is considered one of U2's signature songs, and is one of the band's most performed tracks. Critics rate it among the best political protest songs, and it has been covered by over a dozen artists. It was named the 272nd-greatest song by Rolling Stone on their list of \"The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time.\""@en ;

It was written by Rowland, Scott Storch and Jason \"Poo Bear\" Boyd and co-produced by Storch and Boyd for Rowland's second studio album, Ms. Kelly (2007). The full track was leaked on May 31, 2007 onto the internet. Although Columbia Records intended to release \"Work\" as Ms. Kelly's lead single, \"Like This\" was eventually chosen as Rowland, who was influenced by the negative feedback the song received from blogs after the leaked snippets, began to think that that \"Work\" had no commercial potential. Freemasons, later remixed \"Work\", which according to Rowland, gave it \"new life\". \"Work\" is an up-tempo composition which displays elements of funk music and go-go. Composed in the key of D#minor, the song lyrically speaks of a woman who affirms to her man that actions speak louder than words and that she is not a woman who is easy to get to. Following the less successful chart performances of previous single \"Ghetto\", the record was released as the album's second single during the first quarter of 2008 (see 2008 in music) in most international music markets, excluding parts of North America. Prominently pushed by a re-arranged remix by British producer duo Freemasons, \"Work\" enjoyed major commercial success and eventually became Rowland's best-charting solo single since her 2002 songs \"Dilemma\" and \"Stole\", reaching the top ten in Australia, Finland, France, Greece, Italy, Switzerland, Turkey, and the United Kingdom.\"Work\" is her fourth international most successful solo single to date, behind \"Dilemma\", \"When Love Takes Over\" and \"Stole\". The music video for \"Work\" was filmed in Los Angeles, California and was directed by Philip Andelman.

It was initially written and recorded under the working title, \"I Wouldn't Wanna Be\", by Swiss model Kirsty Bertarelli after she met Swiss entrepreneur Ernesto Bertarelli in 1997. All Saints' later recording was produced by William Orbit who together with group members Shaznay Lewis and Melanie Blatt gave it a new arrangement and renamed it \"Black Coffee\". A moderately fast ambient, electropop and R&B song, \"Black Coffee\" has a distinctly production-laden and hazy sound with obscure and breathy keyboard instruments, guitar, synths and glitching electronics throughout. It is a sad love song about Kirsty's love at first sight feelings for Ernesto. London Records released the song on 2 October 2000 as the second single from Saints & Sinners. It was met with acclaim from contemporary music critics who commended its wistful sound, Orbit's electronic production and the group's harmonies. \"Black Coffee\" marked All Saints' fifth number-one single on the UK Singles Chart and at the time made them the girl group with the second-most number singles in the UK after the Spice Girls, surpassing B*Witched. It also charted highly in other countries, reaching the top 10 in Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, New Zealand and Sweden. The song's accompanying music video was directed by Johan Renck and made use of bullet time-like effects while the group serenaded an arguing couple in a high rise penthouse at night. All Saints promoted \"Black Coffee\" with live performances on Top of the Pops, Children in Need, Later... with Jools Holland and at the Smash Hits Poll Winners Party. In spite of the song's reception, its release and recording was amid a tense rift within the group which became publicly visible in their live renditions as well as in the music video during which each member purposely avoided each other by filming their scenes separately.

	dbo:abstract	"\"Soldier\" is a song by American recording group Destiny's Child featuring American rappers T.I. and Lil Wayne. Columbia Records released \"Soldier\" as the second single from Destiny's Child's fourth studio album Destiny Fulfilled (2004) on December 7, 2004. The artists co-wrote the song with Sean Garrett and Rich Harrison; the latter co-produced it with Destiny's Child members Beyonc\u00E9 and Kelly Rowland. A Southern hip hop mid-tempo song, it lyrically describes each members' favorite type of male love interest. \"Soldier\" received mostly positive reviews from music critics who praised its composition and the trio's vocal performances, but criticized the lyrical content. The song received a nomination in the category for Best Rap/Sung Collaboration at the 48th Annual Grammy Awards and won a Best R&B/Soul Single by a Group, Band or Duo award at the 2005 Soul Train Music Awards. A commercial success, \"Soldier\" peaked within the top five in six European countries and in Australasia further being certified gold in the countries in the latter region. In the US, it peaked at number three on the Billboard Hot 100 and topped the Hot Dance Club Songs further receiving a Platinum certification by the RIAA. The black-and-white music video directed by Ray Kay featured cameo appearances by several rappers and singers. It was nominated at the 2005 MTV Video Music Awards under the category of Best Group Video. The band performed \"Soldier\" on several televised appearances in 2004 and 2005 and included it on the set list of their final tour Destiny Fulfilled... And Lovin' It (2005). Both Beyonc\u00E9 and Rowland performed the song during their solo tours after Destiny's Child's disbandment. The song was sampled in many songs by different artists, most notably by Nelly on his single \"Grillz\" (2005)."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"Bless the Beasts and Children\" is the theme song to the 1971 eponymous film and was performed by The Carpenters. It was featured on the B-side to their hit, \"Superstar\". The B-side charted on the Billboard Hot 100, eventually topping out at #67. In order to promote it, The Carpenters performed it on their television series, Make Your Own Kind of Music as \"F\" for \"Film Music\". It was nominated for a 1972 Academy Award for Best Song, but it lost to Isaac Hayes' \"Theme from Shaft\". The original soundtrack included two different versions of \"Bless the Beasts and Children\", the other being an orchestral instrumental arrangement by composers Barry DeVorzon and Perry Botkin, Jr., and the original \"Nadia's Theme\", which was listed as \"Cotton's Dream\". \"Cotton's Dream\" was also used as the theme song to the 1973 soap opera, The Young and the Restless, and later \"Bless the Beasts and Children\" was used when David Hasselhoff's character, Dr. \"Snapper\" Foster, had to say goodbye to his son in a powerful 1982 episode of the series. The song was originally released on the original soundtrack, and a slightly different version was released on the Carpenters' 1972 LP, A Song for You on June 13, 1972. The original soundtrack had a vibraphone playing the melody in the introduction, while the A Song for You version, released on the single, contained an oboe stating the melody. The two versions (soundtrack and album versions) faded out toward the end, but in 1985, Richard Carpenter re-mixed the song so it does not fade out in the end. He also added a harder bass-line."@en ;

dbr:Burn_the_Witch	rdf:type	dbo:MusicalWork ;
	dbo:abstract	"\"Burn the Witch\" is the third single released from Queens of the Stone Age's fourth album, Lullabies to Paralyze. Many of its lyrics run parallel with the dark, folkloristic theme for this album. It has been introduced by Josh Homme when played live as his favorite current song.[citation needed] Along with \"You've Got a Killer Scene There, Man...\", it borrows heavily from the blues, probably because ZZ Top's guitarist and singer Billy Gibbons appears on lead guitar and backup vocals. Gibbons also plays on a cover of his own band's \"Precious and Grace\", a bonus track on the album. The song involves an exchange of vocal lines between the falsetto of Homme and the twin baritones of Gibbons and Mark Lanegan. Gibbons does not regularly tour with the band, so the other vocal was performed by Lanegan, until he stopped touring with the band. Currently, Josh Homme sings alone with backing vocals from the rest of the band, who lack either of the studio musicians' deep growls. In the previous line-up, Homme played bass and Alain Johannes played a quite different version of Gibbons' solo. This song (its remix by UNKLE) was also featured in and on the soundtrack of Saw II. This song is also featured in the trailer to the fourth season of the HBO series True Blood."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"Don't Stop Me Now\" is a song by the British rock band Queen, featured on their 1978 album Jazz that was released as a single in 1979. Written by lead singer Freddie Mercury, it was recorded in August 1978 at Super Bear Studios in Berre-les-Alpes (Alpes-Maritimes), France, and is the twelfth track on the album. Musically the song builds on Mercury's piano playing, with John Deacon and Roger Taylor providing a bass guitar and drums backing track. The song also provides an example of Queen's trademark style of multitrack harmony vocals for the chorus lines. On the studio version, Brian May's only guitar playing is in his guitar solo, but on live versions performed on the band's 1979 Jazz and Crazy tours, May would also play rhythm guitar throughout the rest of the song to give more of a rock feeling to it. A live version of the song features in the band's 1979 album Live Killers. The song also appears in the band's 1981 compilation album Greatest Hits, and in June 2011, as part of Queen's 40th anniversary celebrations, an old take of the song containing more guitar parts was included on the bonus EP of the re-released and remastered Jazz album."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"Heroes and Villains\" is a song by the American rock band the Beach Boys written and produced by the group's leader Brian Wilson in collaboration with songwriter Van Dyke Parks. Envisioned as a three-minute music comedy, it was to be the ambitious centerpiece of the group's forthcoming album Smile. The album was instead shelved, and the song was rearranged and issued as a single in July 1967 with \"You're Welcome\" as the B-side. It charted at number 12 on the Billboard Hot 100. Two months later, it appeared as the opening track to the group's Smiley Smile album. The song was the first written for the Smile project. Though the lyrics are distinctly Western with some allusions to the American Indian genocides, former wife Marilyn Wilson claimed that Brian meant the \"heroes\" and \"villains\" to represent the ones in his life. It was the follow-up single to the group's \"Good Vibrations\"; both tracks were produced using the same unorthodox method of recording a surplus of musical sections in piecemeal using multiple Hollywood studios. Only during its final production stages would the song then be reduced and assembled into a coherent structure. This proved difficult for Wilson, who grew increasingly frustrated with the virtually limitless number of possible song edits. Bandmate Al Jardine later expressed dissatisfaction with the final composite, calling it \"a pale facsimile\" of Wilson's original vision, believing that he had \"underproduced\" the song at the last minute. Reflective of the song's complicated production history, many significantly different alternate versions of \"Heroes and Villains\" have seen release on subsequent compilations, along with numerous pieces derived from unused sections interpolated within the song. These include \"\", \"Do You Like Worms?\", \"\", \"\", and \"\"."@en ;

dbr:Something_About_Us	rdf:type	dbo:MusicalWork ;
	dbo:abstract	"\"Something About Us\" is a song by all-female German pop band No Angels. It was chiefly written by band member Vanessa Petruo along with frequent collaborator Thorsten Br\u00F6tzmann and Alexander Geringas for the group's second studio album Now... Us! (2002), and created as a response to what the band felt was intense and sometimes unfair and inaccurate media criticism at the time, predominantly resulting from the clich\u00E9s and prejudices generally associated with their manufactured band image. Produced by Br\u00F6tzmann and co-producer Jeo, the uptempo track incorporates elements of both the contemporary R&B and dance-pop genre as well as Latin-pop and church music during the ironical bridge. Released as the album's leading single on May 6, 2002 in German-speaking Europe, the record achieved major success by becoming the group's third non-consecutive number-one hit in Austria and Germany within a period of fifteen months. In addition, it reached number three on Eurochart Hot 100 Singles chart and number eleven in Switzerland, eventually going platinum. The record was generally well received by contemporary critics, who acclaimed the band for the production and inclusion of self-written material, and was nominated for both a 2002 Top of the Pops Awards and the 2003 ECHO Award for Best National Single \u2014 Rock/Pop. The music video for the song was directed by Marcus Sternberg, and won the 2003 ECHO Award in the category Videoclip National. Inspired by the media-critical subtext of the lyrics, the clip features the quintet as printers of the fictional tabloid newspaper called Daily Express, each of them facing rumored page-one catchlines such as alleged bisexuality, incest, and physical aggression. \"Something About Us\" was performed on several television and award show ceremonies, such as Die Harald Schmidt Show, The Dome and the 11th ECHO Awards."@en ;

The cover art for the single depicts a tattoo on Bret Michaels's arm of a cross with the words \"Something to Believe In\". The tattoo artist, according to Michaels, had been drinking and spelled \"believe\" incorrectly putting the \"e\" before the \"i\". It was attempted to be corrected by adding a rose to the cross that covered the misspelling, but Michaels was never satisfied with the results.

	dbo:abstract	"\"Sour Milk Sea\" is a song that was recorded by English singer Jackie Lomax and released as his debut single on Apple Records in August 1968. It was written by George Harrison during the Beatles' stay in Rishikesh, India, and given to Lomax to help launch the Beatles' record label. The recording was the first of many extracurricular musical projects produced by Harrison, and a rarity among non-Beatles songs since it features three members of the band. Along with Harrison, Ringo Starr and Paul McCartney, the backing musicians on the track were Eric Clapton and session pianist Nicky Hopkins. Harrison wrote the song to promote Transcendental Meditation, which he and his fellow Beatles had been studying in Rishikesh with Maharishi Mahesh Yogi. The group recorded a demo of the song while considering material for what became their 1968 double album, The Beatles. On release, Lomax's single was overshadowed in Apple's \"Our First Four\" promotional campaign by the Beatles' \"Hey Jude\" and Mary Hopkin's \"Those Were the Days\"; it enjoyed only minor success internationally, becoming a top 30 hit in Canada. The B-side was \"The Eagle Laughs at You\", written by Lomax and also produced by Harrison. Both tracks were later included on the singer's only Apple album, Is This What You Want?, released in March 1969. \"Sour Milk Sea\" has received praise from several music critics. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic describes it as \"a dense, brilliant, and soulful psychedelic rocker\".

dbr:What_More_Can_I_Give	rdf:type	dbo:MusicalWork ;
	dbo:abstract	"\"What More Can I Give\" (also \"Todo Para Ti\" in Spanish) is a song written by American singer Michael Jackson and recorded by a supergroup of singers following the September 11 attacks in 2001. The inspiration for the song had initially come to Jackson after a meeting with the President of South Africa Nelson Mandela in the late 1990s. The song was to be premiered at a Jackson concert, but the singer failed to perform it. The song also failed to gain an official release, despite the pop singer having stated that it would be issued as a charity single for the refugees of the Kosovo War, which ended in 1999. Following the September 11 attacks in 2001, Jackson rewrote \"What More Can I Give\" at the suggestion of Marc Schaffel. Schaffel, who produced and became the executive producer on the project, convinced Jackson to also do a Spanish version of the song as well, and handled the details of the production. Jackson and other artists recorded the new version of the song shortly afterward; the other artists included Britney Spears, Reba McEntire, Anastacia, Nick Carter, Jennifer Lopez, Beyonc\u00E9, NSYNC, Celine Dion, Christina Aguilera, Brian McKnight, Toni Braxton, Luther Vandross, Mariah Carey, Mary J. Blige and Usher. In addition, a Spanish language version of the song was recorded. Entitled \"Todo Para Ti\", his lyrics were adapted into Spanish by the Panamanian musician Rub\u00E9n Blades. Schaffel brought three-time Grammy winner K. C. Porter on to the project to give the Spanish version a different sound from the English recording. \"What More Can I Give\" was scheduled for release as a charity single in the hope that $50 million would be raised between downloads, sponsors, and donations to aid the survivors and the families of victims of the September 11 terrorist attacks. The plan, however, never came to fruition and the reasons why have varied between sources and the individuals involved. One newspaper stated that the release of the song was abandoned after part of a marketing ploy by Sony Music after Jackson started a public campaign against Sony and its USA music head. \"What More Can I Give\" was played on the radio for the first time in late 2002. The debut airing was made without permission by radio station WKTU-FM in New York. The following year, on October 27, 2003, \"What More Can I Give\" was made available to the public by way of digital download for several days. Jackson had the song taken down on the eve of the raid on his Neverland Valley Ranch property by Santa Barbara Sheriffs. Proceeds from the short sale of the song went to children's charities. Schaffel enlisted friend and famed Brazilian artist Romero Britto to design, create, and paint an artwork to be used as the cover for the single. Britto created the \"ribbon\" piece in bright colors including yellow, blue and red. Britto created 250 of this piece as a special collector's item and both Britto and Michael Jackson signed and numbered each of these pieces. Michael Jackson recorded the song in both English and Spanish, and shot the video for Marc Schaffel. Even after his death it is believed to be the \"last\" actual completed song and video that Michael Jackson had done, and approved for release. It was also one of the only few tracks Michael Jackson ever performed in Spanish and is considered the last. Michael Jackson had told many people he felt that \"What More Can I Give\" was a definite contender for song of the year for both the English and Latin Grammys, and felt it would be a more successful as \"We Are the World\". The Spanish version has never been heard by the public. No official release date for either project has been given since the death of Jackson in June 2009, by either Schaffel or Jackson's estate."@en ;

Produced by Madonna and Stuart Price, the song was released as the third single from the album by Warner Bros. Records on June 6, 2006. The decision was spurred by the fact that \"Get Together\" was the third most downloaded song from the album. It was also released to coincide with the start of Madonna's Confessions Tour. Inspired by Stardust's single \"Music Sounds Better with You\", \"Get Together\" portrays an anthem-like picture with its lyrics, about the different possibilities of finding love on the dance floor. Contemporary critics appreciated the song, calling it fluid in nature and a wonderful dance track. They complimented Madonna's ability to turn clich\u00E9 comments into pop slogans with the song. After its worldwide release, the song became a success on the dance charts of the United States but failed to enter the official Billboard Hot 100 chart, only peaked at six on the Bubbling Under Hot 100 Singles chart. It reached the top ten in countries like Canada, the United Kingdom and Italy and topped the chart in Spain. The accompanying music video incorporated Madonna's performance of the song at London's Koko Club, but it was animated to make it different visually. The video showed Madonna singing the song amongst graphical visuals portraying volcanoes erupting and a cityscape. Madonna performed the song on her Confessions Tour where she was accompanied by two dancers wearing horse reins around their head. In 2007, the song was nominated in the category of Best Dance Recording at the 49th Grammy Awards, but lost to Justin Timberlake's 2006 single \"SexyBack\"."@en ;

Written from the perspective of the Angel of Death, it describes the Plague of the Death of the Firstborn (Exodus 12:29). One of Metallica's most frequently performed songs, it has been played live 1,413 times (second only to \"Master of Puppets\", at 1,467), and it has occasionally been used on various tours as the opening song of the band's set. It stands as a classic example of the band's thrash style, albeit slower than the material on their first album, Kill 'Em All. The song's middle section, with its ominous chants of \"Die!\" set to a phrygian mode chord progression, is a fan participation staple during Metallica shows. The single was released through Music for Nations in the UK and France. The b-sides were the cover songs \"Am I Evil?\" (originally by Diamond Head) and \"Blitzkrieg\" (originally by Blitzkrieg). Together these covers were known as Garage Days Revisited, which set the stage for Metallica's next cover album, The $5.98 E.P.: Garage Days Re-Revisited EP. The artwork was done by Alvin Petty.

	dbo:abstract	"\"I Want to Hold Your Hand\" is a song by the English rock band the Beatles. Written by John Lennon and Paul McCartney, and recorded in October 1963, it was the first Beatles record to be made using four-track equipment. With advance orders exceeding one million copies in the United Kingdom, \"I Want to Hold Your Hand\" would have gone straight to the top of the British record charts on its day of release (29 November 1963) had it not been blocked by the group's first million seller \"She Loves You\", their previous UK single, which was having a resurgence of popularity following intense media coverage of the group. Taking two weeks to dislodge its predecessor, \"I Want to Hold Your Hand\" stayed at number one for five weeks and remained in the UK top fifty for twenty-one weeks in total. It was also the group's first American number one, entering the Billboard Hot 100 chart on 13 January 1964 at number forty-five and starting the British invasion of the American music industry. By 1 February it held the number-one spot, and stayed there for seven weeks before being replaced by \"She Loves You\", a reverse scenario of what had occurred in Britain. It remained on the US charts for a total of fifteen weeks. \"I Want to Hold Your Hand\" became the Beatles' best-selling single worldwide. In 2013, Billboard magazine named it the 44th biggest hit of \"all-time\" on the Billboard Hot 100 charts."@en ;

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Papa_Don\u0027t_Preach>	rdf:type	dbo:MusicalWork ;
	dbo:abstract	"\"Papa Don't Preach\" is a song by American singer Madonna from her third studio album True Blue (1986). The song was written by Brian Elliot with additional lyrics by Madonna, and produced by Stephen Bray and Madonna. The song also appears remixed on the 1990 compilation album The Immaculate Collection and in its original form on the 2009 compilation album Celebration. The song's musical style combines pop and classical styling, and its lyrics deal with teenage pregnancy and abortion. It was based on teen gossip Elliot heard outside his studio, which has a large front window that doubles as a mirror where schoolgirls from the North Hollywood High School in Los Angeles regularly stopped to fix their hair and chat. Released as the album's second single in mid-1986, the song was a commercial success. It became Madonna's fourth number-one single on the Billboard Hot 100, and performed well internationally, reaching the top position in the United Kingdom and Australia. It was well received by music critics and was frequently cited as a highlight in the album. The music video, directed by James Foley, shows Madonna's second image makeover, featuring her with a more toned and muscular body, and cropped platinum blonde hair. It portrayed a storyline where Madonna is trying to tell her father about her pregnancy. The images are juxtaposed with shots of Madonna dancing and singing in a small, darkened studio, and spending a romantic evening with her boyfriend. Shortly after its release, the song caused heated discussions about its lyrical content. Women's organizations and others in the family planning field criticized Madonna for encouraging teenage pregnancy, while groups opposed to abortion saw the song as having a positive pro-life message. Madonna has performed \"Papa Don't Preach\" in four of her world tours, most recently The MDNA Tour in 2012. The song also caused her first conflict with the Vatican, as she dedicated it to Pope John Paul II, who urged Italian fans to boycott her concerts during the Who's That Girl World Tour in 1987. In 2002, British singer Kelly Osbourne recorded a hard rock cover of the song which was included as a bonus track on her debut album Shut Up."@en ;

dbr:Space_Oddity	rdf:type	dbo:MusicalWork ;
	dbo:abstract	"\"Space Oddity\" is a song written and performed by David Bowie and released as a 7-inch single on 11 July 1969. It was also the opening track of the album David Bowie. The song is about the launch of Major Tom, a fictional astronaut, and was released during a period of great interest in space flight. The United States' Apollo 11 mission would launch five days later, and would become the first manned moon landing another five days later. The lyrics have also been seen to lampoon the British space programme, which had only launched rockets at that time and has never attempted a moon landing. Besides its title, which alludes to the film 2001: A Space Odyssey, the introduction to the song is a barely audible instrumental build-up that is analogous to the deep bass tone in Also sprach Zarathustra that is prominently used in the film. \"Space Oddity\" was David Bowie's first UK top 5 hit, and was awarded the 1969 Ivor Novello Award, together with Peter Sarstedt's \"Where Do You Go To (My Lovely)?\". It became one of Bowie's signature songs, and his second album, originally released as David Bowie in the UK, was renamed after the track for its 1972 re-release by RCA Records, and became known by this name. In 1975, upon re-release as part of a maxi-single, the song was Bowie's first UK No. 1 single. Bowie would later revisit his Major Tom character in the songs \"Ashes to Ashes\", \"Hallo Spaceboy\" and the music video for \"Blackstar\". German singer Peter Schilling's 1983 hit \"Major Tom (Coming Home)\" is written as a retelling of the song. In 2013, the song gained renewed popularity after it was covered by Canadian astronaut Chris Hadfield, who performed the song while aboard the International Space Station, and therefore became the first music video shot in space. In January 2016, the song gained new popularity following the death of David Bowie, and re-charted in singles charts around the world, reaching a new peak of number 1 on the French Singles Chart and ranking as third on iTunes on January 12, 2016."@en ;

First, in June 1974 and again in 1982 when her rerecording of the song also reached number one October of that year. With that accomplishment, Parton became the first artist ever to earn a number one record twice with the same song. The song also won Parton Female Vocalist at the CMA Awards, in 1975. Whitney Houston recorded a cover version of the song for the 1992 film The Bodyguard. Her single spent 14 weeks at number one on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. It has since become one of the best-selling singles of all time.

There are also two different remixes on two UK 12\" singles, and other singles released around the world, one of which later appeared on Mixed Up as the Extended Dub Mix and differs significantly from the album version in arrangement in that incorporates wholly original drum and bass arrangements.

There is also an edit which was released on 12\" in the US, titled \"extended remix\" as in the European and Australasian releases, but which runs for 6:40 rather than 7:59. According to interviews, the inspiration of the song came when a fire broke loose in Robert Smith's home. After that day, Smith was going through the remains and came across his wallet which had pictures of his wife, Mary. The cover of the single is one of the pictures. The same picture was used as the cover of the \"Charlotte Sometimes\" single, but that version was heavily warped and distorted.

It was written and produced by Jackson, Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis, with additional lyrics by Simon. The R&B and hip hop song is built around a sample of 1972's \"You're So Vain\" by Simon, who also added some new spoken parts into the song; it talks about an unidentified man who attempted to extort money from Jackson. An official remix featuring Missy Elliott was released as the third single from the album on December 11, 2001 by Virgin Records. The album version of \"Son of a Gun (I Betcha Think This Song Is About You)\" received mixed reviews from music critics, with some calling it a highlight from the album, while others criticized Simon's rapping. The remix version also received a mixed reaction from reviewers. The song reached number 28 on the US Billboard Hot 100, becoming Jackson's lowest-charting single since 1983, and also reached low positions worldwide. Its accompanying music video directed by Francis Lawrence depicts Jackson stalking a man in a hotel. \"Son of a Gun (I Betcha Think This Song Is About You)\" was performed on the 2001\u201302 All for You Tour."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"The Boxer\" is a song by the American music duo Simon & Garfunkel from their fifth studio album, Bridge over Troubled Water (1970). Produced by the duo themselves and Roy Halee, it was released as the lead single from the album on March 21, 1969. The song, written by Paul Simon, is a folk rock ballad that variously takes the form of a first-person lament as well as a third-person sketch of a boxer. Simon's lyrics are largely autobiographical and partially inspired by the Bible, and were written during a time when he felt he was being unfairly criticized. The song's lyrics discuss poverty and loneliness. It is particularly known for its plaintive refrain, in which the singer sings 'lie-la-lie', accompanied by a heavily reverbed drum. \"The Boxer\" was the follow-up to one of the duo's most successful singles, \"Mrs. Robinson\". It peaked at No. 7 on the Billboard Hot 100. It performed well internationally, charting within the Top 10 in nine countries, peaking highest in the Netherlands, South Africa, and Sweden. Rolling Stone ranked the song #106 on their list of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time."@en ;

It was a commercial success, helping launch the album to multi-platinum status, and is U2's biggest hit to date. Like many tracks from All That You Can't Leave Behind, \"Beautiful Day\" harkens back to the group's past sound. The tone of the Edge's guitar was a subject of debate amongst the band members, as they disagreed on whether he should use a sound similar to that from their early career in the 1980s. Lead singer Bono explained that the upbeat track is about losing everything but still finding joy in what one has. The song received positive reviews, and it became their fourth number-one single in the UK and their first number-one in the Netherlands. The song peaked at number 21 in the United States, the band's highest position since \"Discoth\u00E8que\" in 1997. In 2001, the song won three Grammy Awards for Song of the Year, Record of the Year, and Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal.

There was no music video made for this single. \"In a Dream\" peaked at number 72 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1998. \"In a Dream\" is a song written and produced by Randy Taylor-Weber of Galaxy Freestyle Records. The song was first created in San Leandro, CA in 1989 at an upstairs studio with a three girl group by the name of First Kiss. It was a house recording made just for the pure enjoyment of entertainment. In 1994, with advanced recording equipment, Randy Taylor-Weber then re-created a three girl group and called them \"Emotion in Motion\". There were various ladies in the group, but on a demo tape that Randy made and promoted to the public, Maria, Claudia and Bernadette's version was the one that stood out. However the group departed and in 1996, Randy re-created the song once more with extensive advanced studio equipment and came across a new singer by the name of Jossette from Redwood City, CA. In 1996, Jossette at the time was working at a Macy's department store, when one of the Galaxy Freestyle Records employees approached her and asked if she can sing. Oddly enough she said yes and this led to an audition with Randy Taylor-Weber. They met up and recorded the smash hit song \"In a Dream\". This version got its break on Wild 94.9 (back then Wild 107.7 of San Francisco), DJ Jose Melendez decided to give the record a chance on radio. Within minutes the phone lines blew up and Jossette was asked to come back and be on Jojo Wright's Make It or Break It segment (JoJo is now at KIIS FM Los Angeles). Shortly after, \"In a Dream\" had its Make It or Break It debut with an astounding 95% saying 'make it'. From there, the song became the longest running # 1 song at the time on the daily countdown (17 weeks long until No Doubt's \"Don't Speak\" took over the top spot). Several radio stations across the country, mainly on the west coast added \"In a Dream\" to its Weekly Chart. The song became a staple in the dance freestyle music industry.In 1997, Robbins Entertainment's artist Rockell, covered the song \"In a Dream\" and it became an instant smash in markets where Galaxy Freestyle Records hadn't been able to reach (due to not having major record budgets). Rockell stays active in performing around the United States. Randy Taylor-Weber jump started another record label \"Galaxy Inc.Records\" and released two songs that entered the top 200 on Mediabase in 2013 entitled \"Take me back to Vegas\" and \"In the Club\"."@en ;

Following the breakthrough of the title track's success, the song, written solely by Gaye, became one of the most poignant anthems of sorrow regarding the environment. Led by Gaye playing piano, strings conducted by Paul Riser & David Van de Pitte, multi-tracking vocals from Gaye & The Andantes, multiple background instruments provided by The Funk Brothers and a leading sax solo by Wild Bill Moore, the song rose to #4 on Billboard's Pop Singles chart and #1 for two weeks on the R&B singles charts on August 14 through to August 27, 1971. The song also brought Gaye one of his rare appearances on the Adult Contemporary chart, where it peaked at #34. In 1991, a music video of the song was released by Motown Records featuring appearances by celebrities such as Smokey Robinson, Johnny Gill, Big Daddy Kane, Holly Robinson Peete, Ralph Tresvant, Bobby Brown, Rosie Perez, Bell Biv Devoe, Wesley Snipes, Malcolm Jamal Warner, Diana Ross, Stevie Wonder, David Bowie and Vanessa L. Williams. As the single became his second million seller from What's Going On, the album started on the soul album charts in the top five and began charging up the pop rankings. \"Mercy Mercy Me (The Ecology)\" soon became one of Gaye's most famous songs in his extensive catalogue. In 2002 it was his third single recording to win a \"Grammy Hall of Fame\" Award. Like \"Inner City Blues\", Bob Babbitt, not James Jamerson, plays the bass line. Also in 1991, Robert Palmer combined the song in a medley with Gaye's 1976 hit \"I Want You\". Palmer's single reached #16 on the Billboard Hot 100 and #4 on the Adult Contemporary chart in early 1991."@en ;

dbr:The_Bitch_Is_Back	rdf:type	dbo:MusicalWork ;
	dbo:abstract	"\"The Bitch Is Back\" is a rock song by Elton John, written with Bernie Taupin. It was the second single released from his 1974 album Caribou, and reached number 1 in Canada (his sixth in that country), number 4 in the United States and number 15 in the United Kingdom. The song has been identified as one of Elton John's best hard rock cuts. In the U.S., it was certified Gold on 13 September 1995 by the RIAA. The idea to create the song was inspired not by John or Taupin directly, but rather by Bernie Taupin's wife of the time. Taupin then wrote the lyrics. Musically, the song originally was written in A-flat major, but is today performed live a half step lower in the key of G major. The saxophone solo in the middle is nowadays usually performed by synthesizers, while a guitar solo occasionally substitutes, as can be seen in the concert videos, One Night Only and Live in Australia. This song was banned on several radio stations, in the United States and elsewhere, due to the use of the word \"bitch\". For example, in 1976, the program director of WPIX-FM in New York told Billboard, \"We will play records that are borderline suggestive records such as 'Disco Lady' by Johnny [sic] Taylor but we will not play 'The Bitch Is Back' by Elton John. We won't play those types of records no matter how popular they get.\" Producer Gus Dudgeon added a live version of it, recorded on Thanksgiving night 1974 at Madison Square Garden, at the close of the There disc on the reissued two-CD version of Here and There. It is a concert staple for John, who loves to play the song live to this day, often as his opening number. A mixed media presentation of it, with a video cameo from Pamela Anderson, was created for part of John's very successful Red Piano show in Las Vegas. The song was twice recorded by Tina Turner: once for her Rough album in 1978, and again for the John/Taupin tribute album Two Rooms in 1991. Turner also performed the song in her live show in the late 1970s, and with Elton John at the VH1 Fashion and Music Awards 1995 and VH1 Divas Live '99. Dusty Springfield is one of the backing vocalists on the studio version of the song. Lita Ford covered \"The Bitch is Back\" on her albums, Living Like a Runaway and the live album, The Bitch Is Back ... Live. Lita named the live album after his song. In 2013, the song was covered in the Glee episode \"Feud\", mashed-up with Madonna's \"Dress You Up\"."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"19\" is a song by British musician Paul Hardcastle released as the first single from his self-titled third studio album Paul Hardcastle (1985). The song has a strong anti-war message, focusing on America's involvement in the Vietnam War and the effect it had on the soldiers who served. The track was notable for early use of sampled and processed speech, in particular a synthesized stutter effect used on the words 'nineteen' and 'destruction'. It also includes various non-speech, re-dubbed sampling, such as crowd noise and a military bugle call. \"19\" features sampled narration (voiced by Peter Thomas), out-of-context interview dialogue (\"I wasn't really sure what was going on\") and news reports from Vietnam Requiem the ABC television documentary about the post-traumatic stress disorder suffered by Vietnam veterans. In 2009, the song placed at 73 on VH1's 100 Greatest One-Hit Wonders of the 80s. \"19\" had huge international success in the charts; it went to No. 1 in the UK (for five weeks), a number of other countries worldwide, and yet only met with muted reception in the US Pop Charts. Despite this, the single had great success in the Dance and Club charts, where it went to number 1. \"19\" became the top-selling single in 13 countries. This was helped by the fact that versions of the song, spoken by well-known local news anchors, were recorded in French, Spanish, German and Japanese. The song received the Ivor Novello award for Best-selling single of 1985. The song's English-language release came in three different 12\" versions - \"Extended Version\", \"Destruction Mix\" and \"The Final Story\", each with an alternative cover design."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"We Belong Together\" is a song by American singer Mariah Carey from her tenth studio album, The Emancipation of Mimi (2005). The song was released on March 29, 2005, through Island Records as the second single from the album. \"We Belong Together\" was written by Carey, Jermaine Dupri, Manuel Seal, and Johnt\u00E1 Austin, and produced by the former three. As the song samples lyrics from Bobby Womack's \"If You Think You're Lonely Now\" (1981) and The Deele's \"Two Occasions\" (1987), several other songwriters are credited. \"We Belong Together\" is built on a simple piano arrangement with an understated backbeat. The lyrics chronicle a woman's desperation for her former lover to return. Following her decline in popularity between 2001 and 2005, critics dubbed the song her musical comeback, as many had considered her career was over. \"We Belong Together\" earned her several music industry awards and nominations throughout 2005\u201306. The song broke chart records in the United States and became Carey's sixteenth topper on the US Billboard Hot 100. After staying at number one for fourteen non-consecutive weeks, it was placed as the second longest running number one song in US chart history, behind Carey's own \"One Sweet Day,\" collaboration with Boyz II Men (1995). Billboard listed it as the \"song of the decade\" and the ninth most popular song of all time. Additionally, it broke several airplay records, gathering both the largest one-day and one-week audiences in history. \"We Belong Together\" also topped the charts in Australia and reached the top two in Canada, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom. The song's music video was filmed as a two-part story with \"It's Like That\", which featured Carey at her bachelorette party. The video for \"We Belong Together\" is a continuation focusing on Carey's wedding to an older and powerful man and ends with the singer eloping with her ex-lover. Rumors arose of the video's connection to her 1993 marriage to Tommy Mottola. Carey performed the song on several award shows and television appearances around the world, namely 2005 MTV Movie Awards, MTV Video Music Awards, Macy's Fourth of July Parade, The Oprah Winfrey Show and the 48th Grammy Awards. In Europe the song was performed at the Live 8 charity concert, the Fashion Rocks in Monaco, and the German Bambi Awards. Carey performed the song on both her Adventures of Mimi and Angels Advocate Tours."@en ;

The latter is best known for writing the jazz standard \"Okay, Alright, You Win\", whereas Aaron Schroeder co-wrote a whole bunch of hits from the rock`n`roll area, from \"Fools Hall of Fame\" (Pat Boone) to \"Because They're Young\" (Duane Eddy). In an interview conducted by Jan-Erik Kjeseth, he also revealed that in fact he worked with his partner Wally Gold in order to improve a song submitted by another writer, and the end result was \"It's My Party\", a big hit for Lesley Gore. Schroeder and Gold tossed a coin as to whose name should go on the record, and Gold \"won\". Other titles written by the duo include \"It's Now or Never\" and \"Good Luck Charm\"; both of which - like \"A Big Hunk o' Love\" - were originally recorded by American rock and roll icon Elvis Presley. \"A Big Hunk o'Love\" was released as a single on June 23, 1959 by RCA Victor and later topped the Billboard Hot 100 for two weeks. The song was revived by Presley in 1972 during his engagements at the Las Vegas Hilton in February 1972 and was used in his live shows until mid-1973. It was performed live for the last time on January 26, 1974. The song is included in the 1972 documentary Elvis On Tour and his 1973 show broadcast via satellite, Aloha from Hawaii.

	dbo:abstract	"\"Shoplifters of the World Unite\" is a song by The Smiths. It was released as a single in January 1987, reaching No. 12 in the UK Singles Chart. As was often the case with Smiths singles, it did not appear on an original studio album. It can be found on the Louder Than Bombs, Singles, The World Won't Listen and Sound of The Smiths compilations. Another newly completed song, \"You Just Haven't Earned It Yet, Baby\", was originally intended to be the A-side of this single. The single even made it to the white label test pressing stage and approximately 900 stock copies of the single were manufactured before the proper single was issued. This aborted single mix can be heard on the UK compilation The World Won't Listen, while the song was later remixed for the American compilation Louder Than Bombs. The title alludes to the communist slogan \"Workers of the world, unite!\", and[citation needed] the 1966 David and Jonathan hit 'Lovers of the World Unite'. The sleeve features a photograph of a young Elvis Presley that was taken by James R. Reid. During a 1987 interview with Shaun Duggan, Morrissey explained the meaning of the song as follows: \"It's more or less spiritual shoplifting, cultural shoplifting, taking things and using them to your own advantage.\" Musically the song bears a strong resemblance to the T.Rex song \"Children of the Revolution\". Both Morrissey and Johnny Marr are Marc Bolan fans, and Marr has admitted in an interview that the melody for a previous Smiths single, \"Panic\", was copied from \"Metal Guru\". The heavy metal band Pist.on recorded a cover of \"Shoplifters of the World Unite\" on their 1996 album Number One. South African band Sugardrive covered the song on a 2002 holiday album. The Santa Sessions. Morrissey has said that this is his favourite Smiths song.[citation needed] He has frequently played it live since 1995."@en ;

It was first released in 1972 as the final track on the album Seventh Sojourn. \"I'm Just a Singer (In a Rock and Roll Band)\" was later released as a single in 1973, with \"For My Lady\" on the B-side. It was the second single released from Seventh Sojourn, with the first being \"Isn't Life Strange\" (also written by John Lodge). \"I'm Just a Singer (In a Rock and Roll Band)\" was written by the Moody Blues' bassist John Lodge, who won an ASCAP songwriting award for it. It is one of John Lodge's signature high-energy rock and roll songs, and is one of his best-known compositions for the Moody Blues, along with \"Ride My See-Saw.\" \"I'm Just a Singer (In a Rock and Roll Band)\" was the final single by The Moody Blues to feature the use of the Chamberlin (which had recently replaced the similar instrument, the Mellotron). The Chamberlin would later be replaced by a more modern keyboard synthesizer. A promotional music-video was filmed for \"I'm Just a Singer (In a Rock and Roll Band)\". This video showed The Moody Blues' flautist Ray Thomas playing a Baritone Saxophone. However, the saxophone was used just for effect in the video. The saxophone sound actually comes from the Chamberlin. \"I'm Just a Singer (In a Rock and Roll Band)\" reached #12 on the Billboard Hot 100 in the U.S., becoming one of their highest-charting hits in that country, but fared less well in their native UK, where it managed #36. It was also the final single released by the Moody Blues prior to their five year hiatus, which was agreed upon so each of the band members could pursue their own solo careers. Their next single would not be until 1978, with \"Steppin' in a Slide Zone.\""@en ;

Written by Anastacia, Sam Watters, and Louis Biancaniello, the song was released as the lead single from her debut album, Not That Kind (2000). In the U.S. \"I'm Outta Love\" is Anastacia's only single to chart on the Billboard Hot 100, peaking at number eighty-two, but was nevertheless a success on Billboard's dance charts, where it reached number two for 8 consecutive weeks on the Hot Dance Club Play and Hot Dance Airplay charts. The song is also noted as the first song in US Billboard Hot 100 history to debut at a chart position below the top 40 of the charts, climb up a few places and stay at that peak for more than three consecutive weeks. The song peaked at number 82 and stayed consecutively at this peak for seven weeks before falling off the charts. This record would only be broken in 2003 by Blu Cantrell's song \"Breathe\" featuring Sean Paul, which debuted at 59, but then peaked at 41 and stayed there for nine consecutive weeks. However, even with the moderate success of the song in the US, the song was met with both critical acclaim and extreme commercial success outside of the US, launching Anastacia into superstar status where it peaked in Australia, Belgium (Flanders and Wallonia), and New Zealand, and reached the top ten in Austria, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Switzerland, and the UK. The song ended 2000 as Europe's fourth best-selling single, as well as the year's top-selling single in both Australia and New Zealand, and has gone on to become one of the singer's signature hits."@en ;

The song was written by Powderfinger lead singer Bernard Fanning, and influenced by bassist John Collins. The riff was then developed by guitarist Ian Haug. The song is about reconciling difficulties and arguments, rather than shifting the blame. \"I Don't Remember\" was lauded by some reviewers, who appreciated its energy, while other reviewers were more critical, dubbing it an \"advertisement song\". The music video also received critical acclaim, especially for the parodies it contained. Despite the reviews, the single charted poorly, reaching number 42 on the ARIA Singles Chart."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"Juxtapozed with U\" is the thirteenth single by Super Furry Animals. It was the first single to be taken from the Rings Around the World album and reached number 14 on the UK Singles Chart on its release in July 2001. The song was initially conceived as a duet but, after both Brian Harvey and Bobby Brown turned the band down, lead singer Gruff Rhys sang the entire track, using a vocoder on the verses to imitate another person. Musically \"Juxtapozed with U\" has echoes of Philadelphia soul and the \"plastic soul\" of David Bowie's album Young Americans and was inspired by the Paul McCartney and Stevie Wonder track \"Ebony and Ivory\". Rhys has claimed that he sees \"Juxtapozed with U\" as \"fairly subversive\" because its polished pop style was in stark contrast to the \"macho\" guitar music the band felt was prevalent in 2001. Critical reaction to the track was generally positive with some reviewers describing it as the band's best single to date. A promotional music video was produced to accompany \"Juxtapozed with U\"'s release as a single. Directed by Dawn of the New Assembly/H5 the video features a computer generated women and man seen as thermal images. The couple drive around New York and attend a party on the top floor of a skyscraper which is enveloped in flames towards the end of the track. An alternative video, directed by Fukme 99, was included on the DVD version of Rings Around the World. This video features three people walking through the streets of Hammersmith, dressed in cardboard costumes as a camcorder, clapperboard and microphone. The characters meet up with a fourth person wearing a large cardboard head and arms and then dance with several other people dressed in cardboard outside a group of warehouse. The DVD version of Rings Around the World also includes two remixes of \"(Drawing) Rings Around the World\" by Lesser and the Super Furry Animals themselves."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"(Marie's the Name) His Latest Flame\" is a song recorded in a hit version by Elvis Presley and published by Elvis Presley Music in 1961. It was written by Doc Pomus and Mort Shuman and originally recorded by Del Shannon on the album Runaway With Del Shannon, which was released in June 1961. The more famous and successful recording by Presley was released in August 1961 and remains one of a few of his recordings that tend to have appeal for non-fans. The relatively intense tune, featuring a Bo Diddley beat, performed well on both pop and easy listening stations, reaching No. 4 on the Billboard Hot 100, and No. 2 on the Easy Listening chart, based (at the time) on the Top 100. However, the single's Hot 100 chart run was atypical of a Top Ten hit. In the autumn of 1961 it shot from 22 to 4, then dropped to 10, then 26, all within the space of four weeks. The single (a double A-side with \"Little Sister\", as in the States) spent four weeks at No. 1 in the UK Singles Chart \u2014 one of Presley's nine UK chart-toppers between 1960 and 1962."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"Rock Around the Clock\" is a rock and roll song in the 12-bar blues format written by Max C. Freedman and James E. Myers (the latter under the pseudonym \"Jimmy De Knight\") in 1952. The best-known and most successful rendition was recorded by Bill Haley & His Comets in 1954 for American Decca. It was a number one single on both the US and UK charts and also re-entered the UK Singles Chart in the 1960s and 1970s. It was not the first rock and roll record, nor was it the first successful record of the genre (Bill Haley had American chart success with \"Crazy Man, Crazy\" in 1953, and in 1954, \"Shake, Rattle and Roll\" sung by Big Joe Turner reached No. 1 on the Billboard R&B chart). Haley's recording nevertheless became an anthem for rebellious 1950s youth and is widely considered to be the song that, more than any other, brought rock and roll into mainstream culture around the world. The song is ranked No. 158 on the Rolling Stone magazine's list of The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time. Although first recorded by Italian-American band Sonny Dae and His Knights on March 20, 1954, the more famous version by Bill Haley & His Comets is not, strictly speaking, a cover version. Myers claimed the song had been written specifically for Haley but, for various reasons, Haley was unable to record it himself until April 12, 1954. The original full title of the song was \"We're Gonna Rock Around the Clock Tonight!\". This was later shortened to \"(We're Gonna) Rock Around the Clock\", though this form is generally only used on releases of the 1954 Bill Haley Decca Records recording; most other recordings of this song by Haley and others (including Sonny Dae) shorten this title further to \"Rock Around the Clock\"."@en ;

dbr:Bohemian_Rhapsody	rdf:type	dbo:MusicalWork ;
	dbo:abstract	"\"Bohemian Rhapsody\" is a song by the British rock band Queen. It was written by Freddie Mercury for the band's 1975 studio album A Night at the Opera. It is a six-minute suite, consisting of several sections without a chorus: an intro, a ballad segment, an operatic passage, a hard rock part and a reflective coda. The song is a more accessible take on the 1970s progressive rock genre. It was the most expensive single ever made at the time of its release. When it was released as a single, \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" became a commercial success, staying at the top of the UK Singles Chart for nine weeks and selling more than a million copies by the end of January 1976. It reached number one again in 1991 for another five weeks when the same version was re-released, eventually becoming the UK's third best-selling single of all time. It topped the charts in several other markets as well, including Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Ireland and The Netherlands, later becoming one of the best-selling singles of all time. In the United States the song originally peaked at number nine in 1976. It returned to the chart at number two in 1992 following its appearance in the film Wayne's World, which revived its American popularity. Although critical reaction was initially mixed, \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" remains one of Queen's most popular songs and is frequently placed on modern lists of the greatest songs of all time. The single was accompanied by a promotional video, which many scholars consider ground-breaking. Rolling Stone magazine states: \"Its influence cannot be overstated, practically inventing the music video seven years before MTV went on the air.\" In 2004, \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame. In 2012, the song topped the list on an ITV nationwide poll in the UK to find \"The Nation's Favourite Number One\" over 60 years of music."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\" is a song by the American rock band Nirvana. It is the opening track and lead single from the band's second album, Nevermind (1991), released on DGC Records. Written by Kurt Cobain, Krist Novoselic, and Dave Grohl and produced by Butch Vig, the song uses a verse-chorus form where the main four-chord riff is used during the intro and chorus to create an alternating loud and quiet dynamic. The sound of the song (as Cobain admitted) is modeled after the sound of the Pixies. The unexpected success of \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\" in late 1991 propelled Nevermind to the top of the charts at the start of 1992, an event often marked as the point where alternative rock entered the mainstream. \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\" was Nirvana's biggest hit, reaching number six on the Billboard Hot 100 and placing high on music industry charts all around the world in 1991 and 1992. \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\" received many critical plaudits, including topping the Village Voice Pazz & Jop critics' poll and winning two MTV Video Music Awards for its music video, which was in heavy rotation on music television. The song was dubbed an \"anthem for apathetic kids\" of Generation X, but the band grew uncomfortable with the success and attention it received as a result. In the years since Cobain's death, listeners and critics have continued to praise \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\" as one of the greatest songs of all time."@en ;

The song was written and produced by Shakira, Jean, Jerry 'Wonder' Duplessis and LaTavia Parker. \"Hips Don't Lie\" is a salsa and worldbeat song, which heavily incorporates samples from Jean's earlier single \"Dance Like This\" and \"Amores Como el Nuestro\" written by Omar Alfanno. Upon its release, \"Hips Don't Lie\" received generally favorable reviews from music critics. It received several accolades, including a People's Choice Award, an MTV Latin America Video Music Award, and an MTV Video Music Award. \"Hips Don't Lie\" reached the number one spot on charts in at least 55 countries including the U.S. Billboard Hot 100, becoming her first number one single in the country. It also broke the record for the most radio plays in a single week and the fastest selling digital download song in the United States. The song was eventually certified Triple platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), where it has sold over 3 million copies. It also topped the charts in Australia, Italy and the United Kingdom. Having sold over 16 million copies (10 million digital downloads and 6 million physical copies) by the turn of the decade, the track became one of the best-selling singles of the 21st century in physical singles and digital downloads combined.

dbr:All_by_Myself	rdf:type	dbo:MusicalWork ;
	dbo:abstract	"\"All by Myself\" is a power ballad by American artist Eric Carmen released in 1975. The verse is based on the second movement (Adagio sostenuto) of Sergei Rachmaninoff's Piano Concerto No. 2 in C minor, Opus 18. The chorus is borrowed from the song \"Let's Pretend\", that Carmen had recorded with the Raspberries in 1972. The song was the first released on Carmen's first solo LP after leaving the power pop group the Raspberries and was released as the first single in December 1975, to great acclaim. It reached number 2 on the Billboard Hot 100, number 1 on Cash Box Top 100 Singles and number 3 in Canada. The single sold more than one million copies in the United States and was certified gold by the RIAA in April 1976. \"All By Myself\" was Carmen's first of eight U.S. Top 40 hits. In the UK, however, this was his only Top 40 success, peaking at number 12. In a 2006 poll for UK's Five programme Britain's Favourite Break-up Songs, Eric Carmen's version of this song was voted seventeenth. Carmen thought that Rachmaninoff\u2019s music was in the \u201Cpublic domain\u201D and no copyright existed on it. Subsequent to the release of the album, he was contacted by the Rachmaninoff estate and informed otherwise. An agreement was reached in which the estate would receive 12 percent of the royalties from \"All By Myself\" as well as from \"Never Gonna Fall in Love Again\", which was based on the third movement from Rachmaninoff's Symphony No. 2. Carmen has stated that he also incorporated part of another melody into this song. The melody was taken from his previous hit with the Raspberries, \"Let's Pretend.\" Carmen's original version has spawned numerous cover versions by such artists as Celine Dion, Frank Sinatra, Igudesman & Joo, Il Divo, and Only Men Aloud!. On his second solo LP, Boats Against the Current, Carmen had a subsequent Top 40 hit entitled \"She Did It\" which was the antithesis of \"All by Myself.\" It is a happy answer to the loneliness and lovelessness described in this song and its equally melancholy follow-up, \"Never Gonna Fall in Love Again.\" The Carmen version is used in the video introduction for Conan O'Brien's \"Legally Prohibited from Being Funny on Television Tour\", when an obese and bearded version of the talk show host struggles to cope with losing his job as host of Tonight Show. The Carmen version is also featured in the second season's episode 17 of the 90's popular sitcom Friends (set on Joey & Chandler's friendship), and a season 4 episode of the hit sitcom That 70's Show. It was also featured in the film Under Wraps. The version is used also in the film I nuovi mostri directed by Dino Risi, with Ornella Muti and Yorgo Voyagis."@en ;

Steve Lamacq first played the new version of the song on his BBC Radio show, Lamacq Live in the last week of May 2006. Shortly thereafter, an interview appeared with the band in Nylon Magazine where they confirmed the recording of a new version of the song for release as a single. The 'Eleanor' in the title is thought to refer to Eleanor Friedberger, lead singer of indie rock band The Fiery Furnaces who supported Franz Ferdinand during their 2004 tour. Friedberger used to have a relationship with Franz Ferdinand lead singer Alex Kapranos."@en ;

Several news media sources named it as one of the best songs of 2008, while some considered it one of the best songs of the decade. It topped the US Billboard Hot 100 chart and has been certified quadruple-platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), with more than 5 million paid digital downloads.

	dbo:abstract	"\"Stand Back\" is a song written and recorded by American singer-songwriter Stevie Nicks from her 1983 album The Wild Heart. It was released as the first single from the album on May 19, 1983, and went to number five on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 and number two on the U.S. Top Rock Tracks chart in August of that year. The song has been a staple in Nicks' live shows since its pre-album debut at the US Festival in May 1983, and it has also been included in Fleetwood Mac tour set lists since 1987. The main intro of the song features an Oberheim OB-Xa synthesizer. The synth-bass is played on a Roland Jupiter 8. On the Rock a Little tour, the Oberheim is replaced with a Yamaha DX7. There were two mixes made of the song; the generally more well known album version (4:48) and the edited single version (4:18). Differences between the two are somewhat subtle, but the single mix tends to have more of a \"collapsed\" or \"mono\" sound to it and the electronic drum programs are mixed, rather dry and flattened, especially in the song's intro bars; whereas the drum tracks on the album mix are accentuated by a generous amount of reverb effect and harder compression. Acoustic drums were given a more backseat role on \"Stand Back\". There is a further 'polished' version of the track, with crisper percussion and louder foreground synth, featured on Nicks' 1991 best-of compilation Timespace, remixed by Chris Lord-Alge, and running at 4:59. In the UK, the single was given Nicks' first 12-inch release, featuring a different glossy picture sleeve and the inclusion of a third track, \"Wild Heart\" (album version). A 12-inch promotional single was also released to US radio stations in 1983, featuring a full-colour sleeve, but playing the standard 4:48 album version (in mono and stereo) on both sides."@en ;

It appears on their third album The Queen Is Dead, but was released as a single (albeit in a different mix) several months before, reaching no. 23 in the UK Singles Chart in autumn 1985. This was the first single by The Smiths to be accompanied by a promotional video, something the band had previously resisted. The Smiths also performed this song on an episode of the British television programme Top of the Pops. The jumping man on the cover of the single release is a young Truman Capote. Margi Clarke asked Morrissey if this song was inspired by Oscar Wilde, and Morrissey replied: \"No, that's not true. The thorn is the music industry and all those people who never believed anything I said, tried to get rid of me and wouldn't play the records. So I think we've reached a stage where we feel: if they don't believe me now, will they ever believe me? What more can a poor boy do?\" The chief difference between the single version and the one appearing on the album The Queen Is Dead is in the use of synthesised strings.

The single, released on January 6, 1994, spoke out against the disrespect of women in society, addressing issues of street harassment, domestic violence, and slurs against women in hip-hop culture. Because of its message, many radio and TV stations would play the song without censoring the words \"bitch\" and \"hoes\", which appear often in the lyrics, particularly the chorus and the line \"who you callin' a bitch?!\" that ends each verse.The song samples \"Message from the Inner City\" by The Crusaders. The song was also featured on Living Single, Latifah's series which aired in the same year. There is another version which gained airplay called, \"U.N.I.T.Y. (Queen Ruff Neck Boot)\", which has a similar beat to the album version, reducing most of the jazz sample replacing it with a hip-hop beat. It can found as a clean version on \"20th Century Masters: The Millennium Collection: The Best of Queen Latifah\" & \"Hip-Hop: Gold\".

The song originated from a demo recorded in late 1985 that the group continued to work on throughout The Joshua Tree sessions. Ostensibly a troubled love song, the track's lyrics were inspired by Bono's conflicting feelings about the lives he led as a musician and domestic man. Critics praised the song upon its release. It is frequently performed on the band's tours, and it has appeared on many of their compilation albums and concert films. \"With or Without You\" is U2's second most frequently covered song.

	dbo:abstract	"\"Wow\" is a song recorded by Australian Kylie Minogue for her tenth studio album, X (2007). It was written by Minogue, Greg Kurstin and Karen Poole, while production was handled by Kurstin. Minogue requested to set up a studio in Ibiza with Poole and Kurstin with her while they recorded the track along with other tracks recorded. The song was released as the second single from X on 15 February 2008 by Parlophone, \"Wow\" features instrumentation from guitars, electronic synthesizers, keyboards and drum machines, along with pianos through some verses. The song is set in a dance-oriented beat with many other electronic elements. Upon the song's release, the song received mixed reviews from contemporary music critics, who praised the production and release as a single; however, critics felt that the single was badly timed, as some people referred to this as the first single. Nevertheless, the single was a commercial success. The song managed to peak inside the top 20 on the Billboard Hot Dance Club Songs, as well as charting inside the top twenty in countries including her native Australia, United Kingdom, Ireland, France, New Zealand and Hungary. The song has been performed on three of Minogue's concert tours. It was featured on her first world tour, KylieX2008, in her act Cheer Squad, where the songs \"Heart Beat Rock\" and \"Shocked\" were also performed. It was then featured on her KylieUSA2009 tour, along with a more rock-oriented version being performed at the Aphrodite World Tour. In 2014, Minogue performed the song on the Kiss Me Once Tour and in 2015 on the Kylie Summer 2015 Tour. Along with the promotion in her tours, the song has been featured in many media productions. It has been used as background music in Desperate Housewives, The Kylie Show and was included in the soundtrack of the film Beverly Hills Chihuahua. Additionally, the song has been released twice in the United Kingdom with alternative versions instead of the single version. The accompanying music video was directed by Melina Matsoukas, which featured Minogue in a futuristic outfit, in a club, dancing with alien-inspired outfits worn by the public. The video has received positive reviews, mostly about the futuristic style of format the video had featured."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"'03 Bonnie & Clyde\" is a song recorded by American rapper Jay-Z featuring American R&B singer Beyonc\u00E9. It was composed by Shawn Carter, Kanye West, Prince, Tupac Shakur, Darryl Harper, Ricky Rouse and Tyrone Wrice for Jay-Z's seventh studio album The Blueprint 2: The Gift & The Curse (2002). The song was released as the album's lead single on October 10, 2002. A East Coast hip hop and R&B song, \"'03 Bonnie & Clyde\" sampled its beat from American rapper Tupac Shakur's 1996 song \"Me and My Girlfriend\", and was inspired by the crime film Bonnie and Clyde. The instrumentation is based on programmed drums, bass instruments, and a flamenco guitar. \"'03 Bonnie & Clyde\" was generally received with favorable reviews by music critics, who complimented the combination of Jay-Z's and Beyonc\u00E9's musical styles, their collaboration and the song's production. The single reached number four on the Billboard Hot 100, becoming Jay-Z's second top ten single and Beyonc\u00E9's first as a solo artist. It charted at number two in the United Kingdom and peaked in the top twenty in other European territories. \"'03 Bonnie & Clyde\" was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) and platinum by the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA). The accompanying music video was directed by Chris Robinson, and features Jay-Z and Beyonc\u00E9 playing a modern-day version of the 1920s bank robbers Clyde Barrow and Bonnie Parker. It was nominated for Best Hip-Hop Video at the 2003 MTV Video Music Awards. \"'03 Bonnie & Clyde\" spawned a feud with American recording artist Toni Braxton, who had also sampled \"Me and My Girlfriend\" in her 2002 song \"Me & My Boyfriend\". She accused West and Jay-Z of stealing the idea of using the song as a sample, which was later denied by both of them. \"'03 Bonnie & Clyde\" was performed by Jay-Z and Beyonc\u00E9 on several television shows and was later included on the set list of their concert performances and tours, most notably on their co-headlining On the Run Tour (2014)."@en ;

It topped both the Billboard R&B/Hip-Hop and Rap charts while also reaching number 20 on the Hot 100 chart. The song retains two main versions, the original and a remix which utilizes the same beat as Grandmaster Flash's \"The Message\", titled \"Check Yo Self (The Message Remix)\". The original mix includes a sample from the intro of The Beastie Boys' track \"The New Style\", which uses the phrase \"check it\" throughout the chorus. The song is featured on Ice Cube's Bootlegs & B-Sides album and was later released on his Greatest Hits album. The clean version of \"Check Yo Self (The Message Remix)\" can be found in the video game, Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas, playing on the West Coast hip hop radio station Radio Los Santos and in the soundtrack of the movie Harold & Kumar Escape from Guantanamo Bay.

dbr:Everyway_That_I_Can	rdf:type	dbo:MusicalWork ;
	dbo:abstract	"\"Everyway That I Can\" is the winning song of the Eurovision Song Contest 2003 sung in English by Sertab Erener. The song was written by Demir Demirkan in early 2003 and produced and arranged by Ozan \u00C7olako\u011Flu, famous for his works with pop idol Tarkan. Having previously selected Erener to represent the nation, Turkish broadcaster TRT chose her song to represent Turkey in the 2003 Eurovision Song Contest in Riga. Initially \"Everyway That I Can\" caused controversy with the Turkish public, considered too racy by some and too pop oriented by others. Criticism also arose by Sertab's decision to perform the song in English instead of in Turkish. The song, which combines up-tempo strings with Turkish traditional instruments, was not considered a favourite to win - in fact Russian duet t.A.T.u. were the hottest favourites since Cliff Richard's entrant in 1968, and Spain was second. Turkey performed fourth on the night in May and received an explosive reception afterwards. The song had been re-written slightly to include some high notes and a belly dancing routine was added. Erener sang counter to the rhythm in places and the backing vocals were synthesised with Turkish stringed instruments. The voting on the night saw Russia, Turkey and Belgium switch places at the top a number of times before Slovenia eventually gave Turkey the victory by just two points."@en ;

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/It\u0027s_All_Been_Done>	rdf:type	dbo:MusicalWork ;
	dbo:abstract	"\"It's All Been Done\" is a song by the Canadian alternative rock group Barenaked Ladies. It was released as the second single from their 1998 album, Stunt. Steven Page apparently wrote this song after being embarrassed at how \"wordy\" his song \"Brian Wilson\" was. He decided he wanted to write something with a simple phrase like \"woo hoo hoo\" in the chorus. The song was very successful in Canada, peaking at #1 on the Canadian Singles Chart. Although not as internationally popular as their previous single, \"One Week\", the song was used as the theme song for the TV series, Baby Blues. The song is also notable for being one of the first Barenaked Ladies songs to feature an electric guitar solo by Ed Robertson. During promotion for the album the song was performed on all three big NBC late night shows: Saturday Night Live, Late Night with Conan O'Brien (notable for Steve's messing up by repeating a pre-chorus) and The Tonight Show with Jay Leno. On The Tonight Show, actor David Duchovny, who had appeared as a guest earlier in the program, joined the band for the song in the musical segment, playing an egg shaker. The band had arranged it with the actor after an impromptu meeting a week earlier while shooting a television guest appearance at a studio lot. The band suggested that Duchovny (whose series The X-Files was referenced in \"One Week\") should perform with them after discovering that they'd both be on the Tonight Show. The song was also used to open the setlist of the band's Stunt tour, and has been used to open many shows since. Since the 2008\u201309 NHL season, it has been played during every Detroit Red Wings game played at Joe Louis Arena."@en ;

It incorporates a piano in the background and samples from Pierre Bachelet and Herve Roy's music from Emmanuelle, for which they were credited as co-writers, as the lyrics tackle the singer dealing with the departure of her boyfriend, while reminiscing about their time together. The song was created in a New York studio, after Allen had met Ronson, who was impressed by her previous work and offered her different samples. Contemporary critics gave the song mixed reviews, some claiming it to be Allen's sweetest lyrical moments, while others accuse it of being a fraud. The single peaked at number twenty-one on the UK Singles Chart, being her first single not to reach the top twenty in the United Kingdom. The accompanying music video portrayed a view over the mundane moments of a dying relationship, with Allen watching herself and her ex-boyfriend together. It was directed by Nima Nourizadeh and was mainly shot in black and white. The song was performed live during her 2007 concert tour and also during her 2009 concert tour."@en ;

It was the most successful single of the group's career, peaking at #4 on the Billboard Hot 100 in the summer of 1974. The song features Jim Gordon on drums, as does the bulk of the Pretzel Logic album. The guitar solo is by Jeff \"Skunk\" Baxter who would soon go on to join The Doobie Brothers. Victor Feldman's flapamba (a variant of the marimba) introduction to the song, which opens the album, is cut from the original ABC single version. The MCA single reissue (backed with \"Pretzel Logic\") includes the flapamba intro but fades out just before the actual end of the track. The introductory riff is an almost direct copy of the intro of Horace Silver's jazz classic \"Song for My Father\". In the March 24, 2006 issue of Entertainment Weekly, in an article titled \"Back to Annandale\", it was revealed that Rikki Ducornet was the apparent inspiration for the song due to her friendship with songwriter Donald Fagen while he attended Bard College. Ducornet was pregnant and married at the time, but recalled that Fagen did give her his phone number at a college party at Bard and said that she believed she was the subject of the song.

It was also the only single from Rated R to get a chart position, reaching number 21 on the Mainstream Rock charts, number 36 on the Modern Rock charts and number 31 on the UK Singles Chart. The song was featured in the films Sound City and Smokin' Aces 2: Assassins' Ball, the TV series Numbers, Nip/Tuck, Entourage and Daria, and in the video games Tony Hawk: Ride, Driver: San Francisco and Gran Turismo 5."@en ;

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/It\u0027s_All_Coming_Back_to_Me_Now>	rdf:type	dbo:MusicalWork ;
	dbo:abstract	"\"It's All Coming Back to Me Now\" is a power ballad written by Jim Steinman. According to Steinman the song was inspired by Wuthering Heights, and was an attempt to write \"the most passionate, romantic song\" he could ever create. The Sunday Times posits that \"Steinman protects his songs as if they were his children\". Meat Loaf had wanted to record \"It's All Coming Back...\" for years, but Steinman saw it as a \"woman's song.\" Steinman won a court movement preventing Meat Loaf from recording it. Girl group Pandora's Box went on to record it and it was subsequently made famous through a cover by Celine Dion, which upset Meat Loaf because he was going to use it for a planned album with the working title Bat Out of Hell III. Alternately, Meat Loaf has said the song was intended for Bat Out of Hell II and given to the singer in 1986, but that they both decided to use \"I'd Do Anything for Love (But I Won't Do That)\" for Bat II, and save this song for Bat III. The song has had three major releases. The first version appeared on the concept album Original Sin, recorded by Pandora's Box. It was then recorded by Celine Dion for her album Falling into You, and her version was a commercial hit, reaching No. 2 in the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 and No. 3 in the UK Singles Chart. Meat Loaf recorded it as a duet with Norwegian singer Marion Raven for Bat III and released it as a single in 2006. A music video was produced for each of the three versions; death is a recurring theme in all of these videos, fitting in with the suggestion in Virgin's press release for Original Sin that \"in Steinman's songs, the dead come to life and the living are doomed to die.\" This is particularly evident when the dead characters seem to be resurrected in the memories of the main vocalist. Although in the case of Celine Dion's video, the theme is less about the living being doomed and more about a lost love."@en ;

dbr:Posse_on_Broadway	rdf:type	dbo:MusicalWork ;
	dbo:abstract	"\"Posse on Broadway\" is a hip-hop song first recorded by Sir Mix-a-Lot on his 1988 debut album Swass. He also released a music video. The Broadway in the song is a street in Seattle's Capitol Hill district, a street on which the Mix-a-Lot Posse got lots of good grip from the 50 series tires. The geography of the song is quite specific, going north up Rainier Valley on Rainier Avenue S., then east to \"23rd and Jackson\" (23rd Avenue S. and S. Jackson Street), a major intersection in Seattle's traditionally black Central District or \"CD,\" then cruising east to Martin Luther King Jr. Way S. where \"the set looks kinda dead\" so \"we need a new street,\" then by \"23rd and Union\" (23rd Avenue and E. Union Street, still in the CD, but northeast), and then to Broadway. \"The college\" is Seattle Central Community College near the south end of the Broadway commercial strip, from which they drive to Taco Bell at the north end, which \"was closed\" (a local joke, as that particular restaurant had a never-lit and wholly inaccurate \"Open 24 Hours\" sign built into the wall) so they \"go back the other way\" to Dick's Drive-In, a local fast food institution and, according to the song, \"the place where the cool hang out.\" There are multiple versions of the song: a \"Radio Edit\", which was played over the radio; the \"Thunder Mix, which was included on the Mix-A-Lot compilation album Playlist: The Very Best of Sir Mix-a-Lot; and the \"Godzilla Remix Edit\", which features Godzilla's signature \"roar\" and a sample of the guitar riff from David Bowie's \"Fame\". The Godzilla Mix has slight lyrical differences, most notably Mix-a-Lot referencing the \"Gatorback\" tires instead of the \"50-Series\" tires of the original and a reference to vehicle as \"the Bistro\"."@en ;

It was also included on the June 2008 re-release of Rihanna's album Good Girl Gone Bad (2007). The song was originally included on the standard version of the album without the inclusion of Rihanna. It was written by band members Adam Levine and James Valentine, with production of the song helmed by Christopher \"Tricky\" Stewart, Mike Elizondo, Mark Endert, Mark \"Spike\" Stent and Maroon 5. It was released as an Extended Play (EP) in Australia on May 22, 2007, and as an official single on May 2, 2008, in the United States. \"If I Never See Your Face Again\" was originally intended to be a duet with Janet Jackson and appear on her Discipline album, although label problems interfered. The collaboration with Rihanna later came to fruition when Levine asked her to add her vocal to the remix version, which she accepted. \"If I Never See Your Face Again\" is a pop and R&B song featuring instrumentation provided by synthesizers and a guitar. The song received a mixed response from music critics, who praised the song's composition but criticized Levine and Rihanna's vocal performance. The song's accompanying music video was directed by Anthony Mandler and shot on an indoor soundstage in Castaic, California. The concept for the video was \"high-end erotica\"."@en ;

The song has already appeared on the radio in France, where a promo of the single has been sent out to several major radio stations. On August 23, 2007, the music video for \"Putting Holes in Happiness\", created by the famous French filmmaker Philippe Grandrieux, was released on Yahoo!. Manson has stated in various interviews that select segments of the video were filmed in Germany during the shooting of the \"Heart-Shaped Glasses (When the Heart Guides the Hand)\" video in April 2007.

dbr:The_River_of_Dreams	rdf:type	dbo:MusicalWork ;
	dbo:abstract	"\"The River of Dreams\" is a song by Billy Joel. It is the title track and first single from his 1993 album River of Dreams. The song was a hit, peaking at #3 on the United States and UK charts, making it his highest charting of the 1990s; indeed, it was the only album he released during the 1990s. It also hit the top spot in Australia and on the Billboard Adult Contemporary chart. The song was produced by Joe Nicolo and Danny Korchmar. In the video, the filming was shot on the Providence & Worcester railroad bridge spanning the Connecticut River in the city of Middletown, Connecticut. Other locations that were filmed in the music video are near Portland, East Haddam, and Old Saybrook, Connecticut. The scenes inside the tobacco barn with Joel on the piano were filmed inside a still used tobacco barn in South Glastonbury, Connecticut. Joel and three backup singers appear throughout the video standing on the western span of the bridge, with the open center section of the bridge behind them. Joel's then-wife Christie Brinkley can be seen painting the artwork that features on the front cover of the album River of Dreams. She is the illustrator who painted the actual album artwork, and each single released from the album featured one part of the large painting as cover art. Their 7 year old daughter Alexa Ray Joel appears to be the young girl who is briefly shown before the scene with her mother.At 3 minutes 45 seconds into the song, you can hear Joel singing The Cadillacs version of \"Gloria\" as the song fades out. At least four versions of the song have been recorded and released. Two versions (released years later) include a bridge section containing a piano interlude paralleling Joel's melody from his song \"Lullabye (Goodnight My Angel),\" which is from the same album. These versions can be found on the boxed sets My Lives and Complete Hits Collection: 1973-1999 - but even these versions differ from each other, both in length and in arrangement: one, for instance, has more percussion. A fourth mix appears as a bonus cut on the UK CD single of \"River of Dreams\" \u2014 the \"percapella mix\" done by Nicolo. \"The River of Dreams\" was nominated for the 1993 Grammy Record of the Year award, but it lost out to \"I Will Always Love You\" by Whitney Houston. In his performance of the song during the 1994 Grammy Awards telecast, Joel left a long pause in the middle of the song to protest the decision to cut off Frank Sinatra's acceptance speech after Sinatra received that year's Grammy Legend Award. During the pause, Joel noted he was wasting \"valuable advertising time.\""@en ;
