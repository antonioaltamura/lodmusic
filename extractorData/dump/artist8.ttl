	dbo:abstract	"(\"McCartney\" redirects here. For other uses, see McCartney (disambiguation).) Sir James Paul McCartney, MBE (born 18 June 1942) is an English singer-songwriter, multi-instrumentalist, and composer. With John Lennon, George Harrison, and Ringo Starr, he gained worldwide fame with the rock band the Beatles, one of the most popular and influential groups in the history of pop music. His songwriting partnership with Lennon is one of the most celebrated of the 20th century. After the band's break-up, he pursued a solo career and formed the band Wings with his first wife, Linda, and Denny Laine. McCartney has been recognised as one of the most successful composers and performers of all time. More than 2,200 artists have covered his Beatles song \"Yesterday\", more than any other copyrighted song in history. Wings' 1977 release \"Mull of Kintyre\" is one of the all-time best-selling singles in the UK. A two-time inductee into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame (as a member of the Beatles in 1988, and as a solo artist in 1999), and a 21-time Grammy Award winner, McCartney has written, or co-written, 32 songs that have reached number one on the Billboard Hot 100, and as of 2009 he has 25.5 million RIAA-certified units in the United States. McCartney, Lennon, Harrison and Starr all received The Most Excellent Order of the British Empire (MBE) in 1965, and in 1997, McCartney was knighted for services to music. McCartney has released an extensive catalogue of songs as a solo artist and has composed classical and electronic music. He has taken part in projects to promote international charities related to such subjects as animal rights, seal hunting, land mines, vegetarianism, poverty, and music education. He has married three times and is the father of five children."@en ;

Also worked with Vital Remains, Pitchshifter, Therion, Anathema, G.G.F.H., Kong, Paradise Lost, Banished, Pentagram, Ship of Fools, At the Gates (first 3 albums). Around 1993 Peaceville signed a U.S. distribution deal with Caroline, where Dave and Lyle Preslar worked together for over a year. In 1991, Dave formed Dreambreed, a band in which he provided vocals and played guitar. They were influenced by the Misfits and released a six track Mini CD Sometime in 1995. Dave stayed in Dreambreed, which line-up at that time featured Duncan Patterson of Anathema, until 1998, where he joined Anathema on bass guitar. He stayed with Anathema until 2001, appearing on two albums - Judgement (1999), A Fine Day to Exit (2001), after which he sessioned and later joined Cradle of Filth following the departure of bassist Robin \"Graves\" Eaglestone. Dave appears on: Damnation and a Day (2003), Nymphetamine (2004), Thornography (2006), Godspeed on the Devil's Thunder (2008), Darkly, Darkly, Venus Aversa (2010). In 2005, Dave took a six-month break from Cradle of Filth and started Sixsixsix Records. In that July he was honoured with an appearance on the Roadrunner United CD alongside Peter Steele, Josh Silver, Steve Holt and Joey Jordison. After his break he re-joined Cradle of Filth and played bass on the debut Angtoria album, released in April 2006 via Listenable Records. 21 April 2008 finally saw the release of Dreambreed's \"Misery Sessions\" on CD, via Dave's Sixsixsix Record label. The sessions were originally recorded in 1997 and have only recently been re-mastered. He is currently endorsed by ESP Guitars, Ampeg Amplifiers and Rotosound strings. Dave launched his own monthly podcast Life is a Hideous Thing in December 2014."@en ;

She has performed at the Royal Albert Hall and Royal Festival Hall, and has toured Spain, Italy, France, Holland, Finland, United States, and Australia. She also participated at the WOMAD Recording Week in Bath, Somerset. Liao began to learn the guzheng at the age of three, when she lived in Guangzhou (Canton), Guangdong, China. By the age of nine, she was winning prizes in China, including the prestigious National Youth Music Competition award. She left China with her family in 1983 (at age 13) for the United Kingdom, where she continued her music studies at the famous Chetham's School of Music in Manchester and at the Royal Academy of Music in London. In addition to the guzheng, she also specializes in the Western concert harp and Chinese traditional dance. Apart from playing traditional music and works written by Chinese composers, Liao also has had composers outside China write music for her, which has widened her repertoire from classical to contemporary and electronic music. She has collaborated with Peter Gabriel and Nigel Kennedy, and worked with African, Indian, and European musicians in the Elekoto Ensemble of Akin Euba. Her collaborative work with other world artists was released in 1995 on Real World Records's A Week or Two in the Real World various artists CD. She has extensively collaborated with her husband, Jah Wobble. The piece Heaven And Earth was released on the CD with the same title by Island Records in November 1995. She has since contributed both as a musician and cover-art designer to several other of Jah Wobble's recordings, such as The Celtic Poets, The Inspiration of William Blake, Elevator Music 1A, Mu, and Alpha One Three. Her current project with Wobble is entitled Chinese Dub. She has also released in Europe and the United States notable solo work, such as her guzheng concertos The River (which she performed with the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra) and The Five Tone Dragon. She also recorded music for the Oscar-winning film The Last Emperor. She has performed with the flutist Laura Falzon and premiered a work for flute and guzheng with her, composed by the Scottish composer Edward McGuire. In 2002, Liao began to work with renowned Welsh harpist Elinor Bennett, and their duo performances were well received. In 2008, the duo presented compositions for guzheng and harp by the Welsh composer Bill Connor at Liverpool University, as part of the Liverpool's European Capital of Culture 2008 programme. Liao is a member of staff of Pagoda Cultural Club in Liverpool, and helps to teach the children of the Pagoda Chinese Youth Orchestra and Dance Group, both as a musician and choreographer. She has also served as a visiting teacher at Chetham's School of Music and King's College London."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Charles Britton \"C.B.\" Hudson III (born October 8, 1974, in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma) is an American musician best known as being the lead guitarist of the rock band Blue October. Hudson grew up in Dallas and received his first guitar on his 10th birthday. He was influenced by MTV, was a fan of heavy metal and early on was influenced by guitarists Steve Vai, Stevie Ray Vaughan, Joe Satriani, and Eric Johnson. Later, Hudson explored the music of jazz guitarists such as Norman Brown and George Benson. Hudson played lead guitar in the jazz band at Lake Highlands High School, and upon graduating, he attended Southwest Texas State University in San Marcos, earning a degree in psychology in 1999. He then decided to continue his education and enrolled in the MBA program. In October 2000, Hudson was having lunch at the Kismet Caf\u00E9 in San Marcos and met Justin Furstenfeld of Blue October. Hudson introduced himself and passed along his demo recording to Furstenfeld. Hudson auditioned for the band, and was invited to be lead guitarist. Hudson's first concert with Blue October was December 9, 2000, at Lion's Pavilion in San Marcos. At the end of the Fall 2000 semester, Hudson left grad school with nine hours remaining on his degree, and joined Blue October's Consent to Treatment tour. Consent to Treatment did not sell as well as had been hoped, and in 2002 Blue October was dropped from Universal Records. The band decided to continue independently and toured through the end of 2002. On Blue October's next album, History for Sale, Hudson's heavy metal influence is especially apparent in the song \"Somebody\" which Hudson co-wrote with Justin Furstenfeld and Blue Miller. In 2003, the band released the album on independent Dallas-based label Brando Records. With their new album, the band tried once more for a major-label deal. They showcased the new material in New York City, and it was the song \"Somebody\" that sealed a new contract with Universal. For Blue October's album, Foiled, Hudson wrote the music for the popular song \"18th Floor Balcony\" and his jazz influence shines during live performances of \"Everlasting Friend\" which features a jazz guitar solo to close the song. C.B. continues to write and record jazz-influenced instrumental solo material under his publishing name Reflxblue. Hudson married former Houston Texans Cheerleader and choreographer, Elizabeth \"Betsy\" Rhett Young, in Austin, Texas January 16, 2010. They have a daughter, Ella James Hudson, who was born August 30, 2012. On December 14, 2010 it was announced that C.B. Hudson was leaving Blue October to build a recording studio in Austin, which was opened on March 16, 2013, under the name Orb Recording Studios in partnership with Matt Noveskey. Although he was no longer a member of the band, he contributed guitar to Blue October's 2011 single \"The Chills\" which appeared on their album Any Man in America. In 2013 C.B. rejoined Blue October for a three-show run in Texas. The band also tweeted photos from the studio recording sessions for their album Sway which pictured C.B. playing guitar. In April 2013 Blue October announced that C.B had officially rejoined the band. C.B. played with the band for the entire Sway tour from 2013 through 2015, and recorded the band's eighth studio album Home in 2015. However, Hudson again departed the band in early 2016 following a collarbone injury from an off-road motorcycle accident."@en ;

Nugent's experiments with ska, reggae, rocksteady, dub music, and skinhead reggae came to be noticed through his work with Version City and Stubborn Records. Since 1997, Nugent has been a staple in the New York City ska community, playing backup for King Django, trading dub masters with Victor Rice, and playing in The Slackers. Other bands that featured Nugent's guitar work in the 1990s include: Agent 99, Stubborn All-Stars, Da Whole Thing, and Version City Rockers. In 2007, Nugent released the Crazy Baldhead Has a Posse  CD, which he produced over a 10-year period, with guest musicians featured in every song. Crazy Baldhead released \"the Sound of '69\"  in the fall of 2008. This album features re-interpretations of pop hits from 1969 in the style of Jamaican music of the time - that is, the raw, funk-influenced early reggae championed by producers such as Lee \"Scratch\" Perry and Harry J. In December 2013 Nugent released Boots Embraces after a successful crowd-funding campaign at BigTunes. The record features fellow members of the Slackers Dave Hillyard and Vic Ruggiero, and was mixed by Victor Axelrod. Most of the songs are written by Nugent, except Revolution.Stop, which is inspired by The Clash's Revolution Rock. The album cover states that Aria is written by J.S. Bach, but the song did not make the final cut. It is however available online."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Kalamandalam Haridas (15 September 1946 \u2013 17 September 2005) was a renowned Kathakali musician noted for his evocative rendition of the padams, or playback songs for the characters in the classical Kerala dance-drama. Born in Venmani Mana, a Namboodiri mansion of literary repute in Vellarappilly village east of Aluva off Kochi, Haridas developed interest in Kathakali by watching performances of the classical dance-drama in the neighbouring Akavoor Mana. He was taught the basics in music by Mundakkal Sankara Varrier. He learned \u00B4padams\u00B4 from stories like Rugminiswayamvaram and Kuchelavritham. In 1960, he joined Kerala Kalamandalam and learned music under leading Kathakali musicians like Kalamandalam Neelakantan Nambisan, Sivaraman Nair and Kalamandalam Gangadharan Nair. He was the first student of Kalamandalam Gangadharan when the latter became a teacher in the institution. Haridas was known for a very talented student during his stay in Kalamandalam. Kalamandalam Sankaran Embranthiri, Madambi Subrahmanyan Namboothiri, Kalamandalam Hyderali and Kalamandalam Subrahmanyan were immediate seniors to Haridas in the Kathakali Music section. In 1968, completing the course in Kalamandalam he joined Darpana, a noted performing arts institute set up the famous danseuse Mrinalini Sarabhai in Ahmedabad, as a music teacher. This stint beyond the Vindhyas exposed him to various styles of north Indian renditions, including classical Hindustani music, which in later years will become a mounted musical backup for his innovations as a kathakali singer. A decade later, in 1978, Haridas fulfilled his ambition to get back to his home state for good when he was offered the post of music teacher at Margi in Thiruvananthapuram, where he subsequently worked for three decades. Haridas, on his return to the world of Kathakali, began as shinkiti (accompanist singer) on stage, primarily under star musician Embranthiri, who groomed him. But eventually his melodious voice, clear enunciation of lyrics and support from friends and senior colleagues like Hyderali brought out his potential of rising to an eminent lead singer. He retained the essential emotion-laden Sopanam style of Kathakali music rendition even while infusing in it the microtone-heavy voice culture of the south Indian classical Carnatic music. The most important fact, on analyzing his musical career is the importance he has given to the characterization in kathakali, the emotional quality and depth to the \u00B4vaccikam\u00B4, as it is observed, to achieve this will be the most challenging for any future kathakali singer. In his heyday, Haridas was one of the favourite vocal accompanists of masters like Kalamandalam Gopi, Kalamandalam Ramankutty Nair, Kottakkal Sivaraman and Kalamandalam Vasu Pisharody. Haridas has acted in two Malayalam feature films, Swaham and Vanaprastham, both directed by Shaji N. Karun. He has also appeared in a few television serials. Haridas died of an acute liver problem in a hospital in Thiruvananthapuram. A biography of Haridas, titled \"Bhava Gayakan\", has been published by Rainbow Books. Dr. N.P. Vijayakrishnan is the author. The 2012 documentary film 'Chitharanjini: Remembering the Maestro', is focused on the musical life of Haridas. Haridas is survived by his wife Saraswathi and two sons \u2014 actor Sharath and Harith."@en .

	dbo:abstract	"Marc Alexander Hunter (7 September 1953 \u2013 17 July 1998) was a New Zealand rock and pop singer, song writer and record producer. He was the lead vocalist of Dragon (1973\u201379, 1982\u201389, 1995\u201397), a band formed by his older brother, Todd Hunter, in Auckland in 1972. They relocated to Sydney in May 1975. He was also a member of the Party Boys (1985). For his solo career he issued five studio albums, Fiji Bitter (November 1979), Big City Talk (August 1981), Communication (September 1985), Night and Day (August 1990) and Talk to Strangers (late 1994). During the 1970s Hunter had developed heroin and alcohol addictions; he was recklessly outspoken and volatile on-stage: in November 1978 during the band's United States tour, supporting Johnny Winter, they performed in Dallas, Texas, where \"he made some general stage observations about redneck buddies, illegal oral sex and pick-up trucks\" and called the audience members, \"faggots\". Upon return to Australia, in February 1979, he was fired from the group by his brother, Todd. In August 1982 Hunter returned to the line-up of Dragon and continued with the group while also maintaining his solo career. They disbanded in 1997 when he was diagnosed with throat cancer, he died on 17 July 1998. Benefit concerts were held to provide for his widow, Wendy Hunter, and children. On 1 July 2008, the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) inducted Dragon into their Hall of Fame. His biography, Chasing the Dragon: the Life and Death of Marc Hunter, was published by Jeff Apter in October 2011."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Pedro Altamiranda is a Panamanian singer and composer known for his Carnival songs. Altamiranda sings about the culture and politics of Panama using humorous Panamanian slang. This attracts the attention of crowds, not only of adults but also young people who identify with his songs. Gilberto Santa Rosa, in his song \"Navidad En Panama\", mentions Altamiranda as part of Panamanian culture. Altamiranda started writing songs in 1979. Many of his political songs have been controversial, some of them censored by different governments including the Manuel Noriega dictatorship. In 1984 the song \"Lecciones\" was censored because it is about the electoral fraud that year. With his burlesque songs, he attacked the oppression of Panamanians. In February 2004, one week before Carnival, Altamiranda released the controversial \"La Do\u00F1a\", a satire of Mireya Moscoso. Most of his songs are influenced by Calypso music, salsa, and the Carnival Brass and Drum bands of Las Tablas, also known as Murgas. He also composed a song about the former President of Panama, Mart\u00EDn Torrijos, named \"Cat\u00EDn le dijo a Mart\u00EDn\" (Catin told Martin), which talked about how the President and the Finance Minister supposedly planned the new controversial tax law. Some phrases in Pedro's songs, have become part of the Panamanian culture, among them: \n* \"...Para las Tablas to Rass\" \n* \"...Nos Vemos en las C\u00F3micas\" \n* \"...Juega Vivo!\" \n* \"...Guaro y Campana\""@en .

Shabazz grew up in Detroit, Michigan, where her foster parents largely sheltered her from racism. She attended the Tuskegee Institute in Alabama, where she had her first encounters with racism. Unhappy with the situation in Alabama, she moved to New York City, where she became a nurse. It was in New York that she met Malcolm X and, in 1956, joined the Nation of Islam. The couple married in 1958. Along with her husband, Shabazz left the Nation of Islam in 1964. She witnessed his assassination the following year. Left with the responsibility of raising six daughters as a single mother, Shabazz pursued a higher education, and went to work at Medgar Evers College in Brooklyn, New York. Following the arrest of her daughter Qubilah for allegedly conspiring to murder Louis Farrakhan, Shabazz took in her young grandson Malcolm. He set a fire in her apartment that caused severe burns to Shabazz. Shabazz died three weeks later as a result of her injuries."@en .

He first achieved fame in the 1970s as a member of the punk rock band Generation X. Subsequently, he embarked on a solo career which led to an international recognition and made Idol one of the lead artists during the MTV-driven \"Second British Invasion\" in the United States. Idol began his career in late 1976 as a guitarist in the punk rock band Chelsea. However, he soon left the group and along with his bandmate Tony James formed Generation X with Idol being the lead singer. The band achieved success in the United Kingdom and released three albums on Chrysalis Records before disbanding. In 1981, Idol moved to New York City to pursue his solo career in collaboration with guitarist Steve Stevens. His debut studio album Billy Idol (1982) was a commercial success and with music videos for singles \"Dancing with Myself\" and \"White Wedding\" Idol soon became a staple of then newly established MTV. His second studio album Rebel Yell (1983) was a major commercial success with hit singles \"Rebel Yell\" and \"Eyes Without a Face\". The album was certified double platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for shipment of two million copies across the United States. He followed with a number of successful albums, including Whiplash Smile (1986), Charmed Life (1990) and Cyberpunk (1993). Idol spent the second half of the 1990s out of the public eye focusing on his personal life. He made a musical comeback with the release of Devil's Playground (2005) and again with Kings & Queens of the Underground (2014)."@en ;

Born in Detroit, Laws relocated to Los Angeles after graduating high school. Laws was spotted by DJ Quik who stuck her on a track with AMG. Russell Simmons liked the track and promptly signed her to Def Jam West. Her debut album Born Gangstaz was released in 1993, and the singles, \"Deeper\" and \"Recipe for a Hoe\", hit number one on the Billboard Hot Rap Tracks chart. Laws' fledgling career took a major blow in 1994 when she was interviewed by a reporter from The Wall Street Journal. The reporter revealed that she grew up in an upper-middle-class family and attended private school. In the mid-1990s, she moved to Dallas, Texas, and went on to be a radio DJ. In 2001, she collaborated with Krayzie Bone on his album Thug On Da Line. In 2004, she released a mixtape titled The Six Million Dollar Mixtape produced by Def Jef. It was revealed in May 2011 that Laws is in need of a kidney due to her suffering from renal disease, a disease that rendered her kidneys useless for processing toxins in her body.

Mehldau studied music at The New School, and toured and recorded while still a student. He was a member of saxophonist Joshua Redman's Quartet with bassist Christian McBride and drummer Brian Blade in the mid-1990s, and has led his own trio since at least 1992. His first long-term trio featured bassist Larry Grenadier and drummer Jorge Rossy; in 2005 Jeff Ballard replaced Rossy. These bands have released a dozen albums under the pianist's name. Since the early 2000s Mehldau has experimented with other musical formats in addition to trio and solo piano. Largo, released in 2002, contains electronics and input from rock and classical musicians; later examples include touring and recording with guitarist Pat Metheny, writing and playing song cycles for classical singers Ren\u00E9e Fleming and Anne Sofie von Otter, composing orchestral pieces for 2009's Highway Rider, and playing electronic keyboard instruments in a duo with drummer Mark Guiliana. Aspects of pop, rock, and classical music, including German Romanticism, have been absorbed into Mehldau's writing and playing. Through his use of some traditional elements of jazz without being restricted by them, simultaneous playing of different melodies in separate hands, and incorporation of pop and rock pieces, Mehldau has influenced musicians in and beyond jazz in their approaches to writing, playing, and choice of repertoire."@en ;

Nowell played in various bands until forming the group Sublime with bassist Eric Wilson and drummer Bud Gaugh, whom he had met while attending California State University, Long Beach. As Sublime gained success, Nowell struggled with a worsening addiction to heroin. He eventually became sober after his son, Jakob Nowell, was born.

	dbo:abstract	"Brian Peter George St John le Baptiste de la Salle Eno, RDI (/\u02C8i\u02D0no\u028A/; born 15 May 1948 and originally christened Brian Peter George Eno) is an English musician, composer, record producer, singer, writer, and visual artist. He is best known for his pioneering work in ambient and electronic music as well as his contributions to rock, worldbeat, chance, and generative music styles. A self-described \"non-musician\", Eno has advocated a methodology of \"theory over practice\" throughout his career, and has helped to introduce a variety of unique recording techniques and conceptual approaches into contemporary music. He has been described as one of popular music's most influential and innovative figures. Born in Suffolk, Eno studied painting and experimental music at art school in the late 1960s before joining glam rock group Roxy Music as synthesizer player in 1971. After recording two albums with the band, he departed in 1973 to record a number of solo albums, ultimately helping to develop ambient music with works such as Another Green World (1975), Discreet Music (1975), and Music for Airports (1978). During this decade, Eno would also begin a parallel career as a producer, which included work on albums by Talking Heads and Devo, the no wave compilation No New York (1978), and works by avant-garde artists such as John Cale, Jon Hassell, and Harold Budd, among others. He also took part in frequent collaborations, among them albums with guitarist Robert Fripp, German experimental group Cluster, singer David Bowie\u2019s late-70s \u201CBerlin Trilogy\u201D, and the David Byrne collaboration My Life in the Bush of Ghosts (1981). In subsequent decades, Eno continued to record solo albums, collaborate, and produce for other artists, including U2, Coldplay, Laurie Anderson, James, Grace Jones, Slowdive, and James Blake. Dating back to his time as a student, he has also pursued a variety of multimedia projects in parallel with his music career, including sound installations and his mid-70s co-development of Oblique Strategies, a deck of cards featuring cryptic aphorisms intended to break creative blocks and encourage lateral thinking. He continues to release music, produce, and write, and maintains a regular column in Prospect Magazine. His latest album, The Ship, was released in 2016."@en ;

He was one of the founders of the Soviet genre called \"author song\" (\u0430\u0432\u0442\u043E\u0440\u0441\u043A\u0430\u044F \u043F\u0435\u0441\u043D\u044F, avtorskaya pesnya), or \"guitar song\", and the author of about 200 songs, set to his own poetry. His songs are a mixture of Russian poetic and folksong traditions and the French chansonnier style represented by such contemporaries of Okudzhava as Georges Brassens. Though his songs were never overtly political (in contrast to those of some of his fellow Soviet bards), the freshness and independence of Okudzhava's artistic voice presented a subtle challenge to Soviet cultural authorities, who were thus hesitant for many years to give official recognition to Okudzhava."@en ;

He began his career independently with local releases in 2002, including collaboration album Get Ya Mind Correct with fellow Houston rapper and childhood friend Paul Wall. He signed to Universal Records in 2005 and released The Sound of Revenge under Universal. It included hit singles \"Turn It Up\" featuring Lil' Flip and the number-one, Grammy-winning hit \"Ridin'\" featuring Krayzie Bone of Bone Thugs-n-Harmony. Ultimate Victory followed in 2007, which was notable for not containing any profanity. Chamillionaire is also known for his most anticipated Mixtape Messiah series, which came to a halt in 2009. In early 2011, he left Universal Records, which led to his would-be third album, Venom, going unreleased. Chamillionaire released his first independent extended play Ammunition in March 2012 and was noted as his first major release since he left the label. Another EP, Elevate, was released on February 17, 2013. He said it is going to be one of several to be released before his third studio album, and shortly after his third EP Reignfall was released on July 23, 2013.

Born in Tappahannock, Virginia, he was involved in his church choir and several local talent shows from a young age. Having signed with Jive Records in 2004, Brown released his self-titled debut studio album the following year. It peaked at number two on the US Billboard 200 and was later certified double platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), selling an overall three million copies worldwide. With his first single \"Run It!\" peaking atop the US Billboard Hot 100, Brown became the first male artist as a lead since Diddy in 1997 to have his debut single top the chart. His second album Exclusive (2007) spawned his second Hot 100 number one \"Kiss Kiss\", in addition to \"With You\" and \"Forever\". The album was also certified double platinum by the RIAA. In addition to his solo commercial success, Brown has been featured on several singles such as \"No Air\", a duet with singer Jordin Sparks, \"Shortie like Mine\" with the rapper Bow Wow and \"Shawty Get Loose\" alongside Lil Mama and T-Pain. The songs have peaked at number three, number nine and number ten on the US Billboard Hot 100 respectively. In 2009, Brown received much media attention after pleading guilty to felony assault of his then girlfriend, singer Rihanna; he was sentenced to five years of probation and six months of community service. His third album Graffiti was released later that year, and included the top-twenty single \"I Can Transform Ya\". Brown's fourth album F.A.M.E. (2011) became his first to top the Billboard 200; it spawned the singles \"Yeah 3x\", \"Look at Me Now\", and \"Beautiful People\". F.A.M.E. earned Brown his first Grammy Award for Best R&B Album at the 54th Grammy Awards. His fifth album Fortune was released in 2012. However, after the release of Exclusive, Brown's albums have not been well received commercially or by music critics, with the exception of X, which received a normalized rating of 63. Brown's seventh studio album Royalty was released on December 18, 2015. Apart from his work in the music industry, Brown has pursued an acting career. In 2007, he made his on-screen feature film debut in Stomp the Yard, and appeared as a guest on the television series The O.C.. Other films Brown has appeared in, include This Christmas (2007), Takers (2010), Think Like a Man (2012), and Battle of the Year (2013). Throughout his career, Brown has won several awards, including fourteen BET Awards, five Billboard Music Awards, and three MTV VMA awards."@en ;

He was immensely influential, perhaps the most widely imitated R&B singer of the 1950s and early 1960s, making him a key figure in the shaping of doo-wop and R&B. His high-pitched tenor voice was steeped in the gospel music he sang in much of his younger life. Best known for his solo hit \"A Lover's Question\", McPhatter was lead tenor for The Mount Lebanon Singers, a gospel group he formed as a teenager, and later, lead tenor for Billy Ward and His Dominoes. McPhatter was largely responsible for the success the Dominoes initially enjoyed. After his tenure with the Dominoes, McPhatter formed his own group, the Drifters, before going solo. Only 39 at the time of his death, he had struggled for years with alcoholism and depression and was, according to Jay Warner\u2019s On This Day in Music History, \"broke and despondent over a mismanaged career that made him a legend but hardly a success.\" At the time of his passing, Clyde McPhatter left a legacy of over 22 years of recording history.He was the first artist in music history to become a double inductee into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, first as a member of the Drifters, and later as a solo artist, and as a result, all subsequent double and triple inductees into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame are said to be members of \"The Clyde McPhatter Club.\""@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Konrad \"Conny\" Plank (May 3, 1940 \u2013 December 18, 1987) was a German record producer and musician. He was born in H\u00FCtschenhausen. His creativity as a sound engineer and producer helped to shape many innovative recordings of postwar European popular music, covering a wide range of genres including progressive, avant-garde, electronic music and krautrock. His immense catalog of work has greatly influenced modern studio production and engineering techniques. As a musician, Plank is credited on albums by Guru Guru, Kraan, Cluster, Liliental and Os Mundi. He collaborated with Dieter Moebius on five Moebius & Plank studio albums recorded between 1979 and 1986. The Moebius & Plank sound foreshadowed techno and electronica and influenced many later musicians."@en ;

Ayala aspired to be a professional baseball player, and tried out for the Seattle Mariners Major League baseball team. Before he could be officially signed, he was hit by a stray round from an AK-47 rifle while taking a break from a studio recording session with reggaeton mix tape icon DJ Playero. Ayala spent roughly one and a half years recovering from the wound; the bullet was never removed from his hip, and he credits the shooting incident with allowing him to focus entirely on a music career.

He has also released several solo albums. Though primarily a singer, he sometimes plays melodeon, trombone, guitar or other instruments. Thomas has described his artistic focus as being the \"gestalt of culture, geography and sound\". Common themes crop up throughout much of his work, such as the US Interstate Highway system, images of roadside or \"junk\" tourist culture, Brian Wilson, AM Radio, and many others. Thomas has a distinctive, high pitched voice; Emerson Dameron described Thomas's singing as \"James Stewart trapped in an oboe\", and Greil Marcus writes, \"Mr Thomas's voice is that of a man muttering in a crowd.

	dbo:abstract	"Dion Francis DiMucci (born July 18, 1939), better known mononymously as Dion, is an American singer-songwriter whose work has incorporated elements of doo-wop, rock and R&B styles\u2014and, most recently, straight blues. He was one of the most popular American rock and roll performers of the pre-British Invasion era. He had more than a dozen Top 40 hits in the late 1950s and early 60s. He is best remembered for the 1961 singles, \"Runaround Sue\" and \"The Wanderer\", written with Ernie Maresca. Dion's popularity waned in the mid-1960s, perhaps due to the public's changing taste in pop music, and perhaps in part due to personal difficulties he had during this period. But toward the end of the decade, he shifted his style and produced songs with a more mature, contemplative feeling, such as \"Abraham, Martin and John\". He became popular again in the late 1960s and into the mid-1970s, and he has continued making music ever since. Critics who had dismissed his early work, pegging him as merely a teen idol, praised his later work, and noted the influence he has had on other musicians. Dion was inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in 1989."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"John Richard Deacon (born 19 August 1951) is a retired English musician, best known as the bass guitarist for the rock band Queen. He composed several singles for the group, including the top 10 hits \"You're My Best Friend\", \"Another One Bites the Dust\", \"Back Chat\" and \"I Want to Break Free\", and was involved in the band's financial management. Deacon grew up in Oadby, Leicestershire, playing bass in a local band, The Opposition, before moving to study electronics in Chelsea College, London. He became Queen's fourth bass player in 1971 aged 19 on the strength of his quiet demeanour and electronic skills, particularly the home-made Deacy Amp which guitarist Brian May used to create guitar orchestras throughout Queen's career. From the third album, Sheer Heart Attack, onwards, he wrote at least one song per album, several of which became hits. His song \"Another One Bites the Dust\" became the group's best selling single in the US. As well as bass, Deacon played some guitar and keyboards on Queen's studio work, but was the only member never to sing on their records. Following frontman Freddie Mercury's death in 1991, and the following year's Tribute Concert, Deacon only performed a few times with the remaining members of Queen before retiring from the music industry in 1997 after recording \"No-One but You (Only the Good Die Young)\". He has not performed on any of the other projects that the other two surviving members, May and Roger Taylor, have put together."@en ;
