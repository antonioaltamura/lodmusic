dbr:Music_of_Xenosaga	dbo:abstract	"The Xenosaga (\u30BC\u30CE\u30B5\u30FC\u30AC) series is a series of science fiction role-playing video games developed by Monolith Soft and published by Namco Bandai on the PlayStation 2. The series began with the 2002 release of Episode I: Der Wille zur Macht, which was followed in 2004 by Episode II: Jenseits von Gut und B\u00F6se and in 2006 by Episode III: Also sprach Zarathustra. The music of Xenosaga includes the soundtracks to all three chapters, as well as the music for its spin-off media. These include Xenosaga Freaks, a set of minigames set between the first two chapters, Xenosaga I & II, a Nintendo DS remake of the first two chapters, and Xenosaga: The Animation, an anime series covering the events of the first game. Episode I was composed by Yasunori Mitsuda, Episode II was split between Yuki Kajiura and Shinji Hosoe, and Episode III was composed by Kajiura alone. Xenosaga Freaks reused some of the music of Episode I by Mitsuda while also including new work by Satoru Kousaki and Hiroshi Ohkubo, while Xenosaga I & II and Xenosaga: The Animation used new pieces composed by Kousuke Yamashita. Episode I sparked the release of two versions of its soundtrack album as well as a single, Episode II received two soundtrack albums, and Episode III received one. Xenosaga Freaks and Xenosaga: The Animation each also sparked the release of a soundtrack album. In addition to the albums, Episode I saw the release of a book of orchestral sheet music as well as a book of piano sheet music; Episode II had only a book of piano sheet music. Music from the series has been played multiple times in concerts, especially that of the first two games."@en ;

It also features the Tagalog version of \"Mar\u00EDa la del Barrio\", and \"Juana\" and the English versions of \"Quiero Hacerte El Amor\" and \"Gracias A Dios\". She also made her own versions of the songs \"Tell Me\" (originally performed by Joey Albert), \"Hey, It's Me\" (originally by Jamie Rivera), and \"El Venao\" (originally by Los Cantantes). The album was sung half in English and half in Tagalog. Ricky R. Ilacad is its executive producer. Due to Thal\u00EDa's success in the Philippines, this album was released in 1997 in that country and other Asian countries, under the label OctoArts EMI. This was the first time Thal\u00EDa sang in English and Tagalog. Ten years later, it was re-released in the Philippines with the inclusion of one of her signature songs \"Marimar\"."@en ;

dbr:No_Fences	rdf:type	schema:MusicAlbum ;
	dbo:abstract	"No Fences is the second studio album by the American country music artist Garth Brooks. It was released on August 27, 1990, and reached #1 on Billboard's Top Country Albums chart. The album also reached #3 on the Billboard 200. On the latter chart it stayed in the top 40 for 126 weeks, only one week less than Shania Twain's Come On Over, the Soundscan era's record holder. No Fences remains Brooks' best-selling studio album to date with 17 million copies shipped in the US, and is the album that made him an international star. It was his first album issued in Europe (the original European release contained the four singles from his U.S. debut as bonus tracks). Some of Brooks' most famous songs appear on No Fences, including: \"The Thunder Rolls\" (CMA's 1991 Video of the Year), \"Friends in Low Places\" (Academy of Country Music's 1990 Single of the Year), \"Unanswered Prayers\" and \"Two of a Kind, Workin' on a Full House\". A cover version of The Fleetwoods' \"Mr. Blue\" appears on the album. The album itself was named Album of the Year by the ACM in 1990. It reached Number 1 on the British country music charts (earning Brooks his first gold album in that country) and remained charted for over five years. The track \"Victim of the Game\" was later covered by Brooks's friend and future wife Trisha Yearwood for her 1991 eponymous debut album. Brooks later re-recorded the track \"Wild Horses\", and released the new recording as a single in early 2001, reaching #7 on the country chart."@en ;

According to some advance CD copies, this album was originally entitled Loony Tunes. The album includes the hit \"If I Only Had a Brain\", which a music video was made that featured MC 900 Ft. Jesus reading an advertisement on selling brains. He decides to order one by getting in a box to head to the address of the ad to receive a brain. However, he encounters a misadventure while not knowing what's going on on the outside (from falling out of a window of a factory to being stolen and put in a truck, etc.) while singing the song and doing random activities such as having a disco, eating nuts, or doing yoga; the interior of the box he is in appears to expand in different sizes while remaining the same on the exterior. In the end, a little boy puts the box on a wagon and as he spots a dime on the road, he releases the wagon. The wagon then rolls down a hill back to MC 900 Ft. Jesus' house, right where he started from as he gets out of the box, looking dumbfounded. The video was directed by Spike Jonze and was included in a Beavis and Butt-head episode, which featured Beavis mimicking the musical beat and Butt-head becoming annoyed as a result."@en ;

dbr:Original_Me	rdf:type	schema:MusicAlbum ;
	dbo:abstract	"Original Me is the fourth studio album from German eurodance group Cascada, first released on June 17, 2011. Recording sessions for the album took place from 2009 to 2011 at Plazmatek Studio, Yanou Studio 1. The entire album, like their previous albums, was produced by the two DJs from Cascada, Yanou and DJ Manian. The album\u2019s genre follows in the footsteps of the preceding album, Evacuate the Dancefloor, completely shifting away from the uptempo eurodance, containing electropop songs that are influenced by urban contemporary and pop music. Musically, the album is composed of electro-infused dance tracks with thick euro synths, cymbal crashing beats and Europop lyrics. Lyrically, the album, like the preceding albums, is composed of songs about love, dancing and relationships. The album was released as a two disc set. The first disc features the eleven original songs for the album. The second set is a greatest hits compilation CD, featuring every single Cascada has released internationally. Critical reception of the album overall has been mixed, with many critics praising the new sound and lyrics. The album currently stands as a commercial failure for Cascada, being their first album failing to chart or peak in the top twenty in countries where their previous studio albums sold well. Due to the singles being dismissed by the radios for UK airplay, they failed to chart, and therefore the singles were not supported by retail for a physical release, hence them only being released digitally. This also led to the album being dropped by Robbins Entertainment, which is Cascada's US record Label. Some would say the change of music genre has caused the album to be unsuccessful, due to the fact there weren't any songs featuring their old eurodance style, which they became famous for. Others may say it was the lack of promotion by the record labels. There was a total of three singles released from the album and one promotional song. \"Pyromania\" was the first song released from the album, first released on March 19, 2010. At the time, it was not confirmed to be part of an album. It was then released in the U.S. in the Summer of the same year. \u201CNight Nurse\u201D was released as a promotional single on November 7, 2010 in the U.K., but was released commercially in the United States exclusively on December 16, 2011. It reached number 20 there on the iTunes Dance Charts. \u201CSan Francisco\u201D was set as the album\u2019s best selling single, released on May 1, 2011 in Europe, and released in the U.S. on November 4, 2011. It peaked in the top 15 in the Netherlands, Austria and Germany. And the 4th single was titled Au Revoir, which had came out in September after Original Me was released. It was a failure due to it being after its album being released before it was. It was released in the U.K. and Germany on September 23, 2011 and was released in the U.S. on November 15, 2011."@en ;

The EP was originally released on 7-inch vinyl with a limited pressing of 500 copies on July 7, 1989 through Limited Potential Records. It was the band's only non-compilation release to feature drummer Brian Vermin and the first to feature Dan Vapid (then known as Sewercap), who would be featured on many later Screeching Weasel albums. Musically, the songs on Punkhouse are in a similar vein to the band's previous album Boogadaboogadaboogada!, albeit with a rougher sound. The EP went out of print quickly, and vocalist Ben Weasel repressed it himself on his own label No Budget Records in 1991 without a jacket. The last repress was by Selfless Records in 1993, who released it with a slightly different cover from the original. The song \"Fathead\" was later re-recorded for the group's third album My Brain Hurts in 1991 and all the original tracks from the EP were included on the compilation Kill the Musicians in 1995."@en ;

dbr:Sinatra_at_the_Movies	rdf:type	schema:MusicAlbum ;
	dbo:abstract	"Sinatra at the Movies is a 2008 compilation album by Frank Sinatra. After Bing Crosby, no jazz vocalist had more success in the movies, or was better at intertwining his performances with his films, than Frank Sinatra. From 1940 to 1970, he was never far from Hollywood, and his film successes often went hand in hand with his popular fortune. (Even his movie personals aligned with his musical themes and ambitions, from his breakthrough starring role, in Higher and Higher, to the ambitious On the Town, the scrappy From Here to Eternity, the quintessentially swinging Pal Joey, and the self-satisfied Ocean's Eleven.) Sinatra at the Movies isn't the career-spanning movie retrospective that it should be\u2014instead, it concentrates on his Capitol period of the '50s. (Even his big film hit from 1943's Higher and Higher, \"I Couldn't Sleep a Wink Last Night,\" is present here only in its 1957 version.) The '50s are virtually defined by Sinatra's great music, but the quality of his movie titles was scatter shot. Yes, there were some big hits from the film world -- \"Three Coins in the Fountain,\" \"All the Way,\" \"(Love Is) The Tender Trap,\" \"All of Me\" -- and virtually all of them were great performances. Sinatra was also making sure he recorded plenty of great material, classics like \"I Could Write a Book\" (from Pal Joey), \"The Lady Is a Tramp\" (Pal Joey again), and \"Just One of Those Things\" (Young at Heart). Yet he was occasionally becoming lighter and more pithy by the end of his Capitol era, never more so than when a children's choir began \"High Hopes.\" Overall, it's not a great choice for beginners, although note that it provides a great complement to his studio albums of the '50s. A bonus here is the inclusion of several songs that are comparatively rare on Sinatra retrospectives: \"Not as a Stranger,\" \"Monique,\" and \"C'est Magnifique.\""@en ;

The album is similar to The Essential Michael Nyman Band, although a number of tracks are on only one album or the other.

dbr:The_Cost_of_Loving	rdf:type	schema:MusicAlbum ;
	dbo:abstract	"The Cost of Loving is the third studio album by English new wave group The Style Council. It was originally released in February 1987. The album was recorded over a period of three months in 1986, at Solid Bond Studios (owned by their lead vocalist, Paul Weller). The album is generally regarded as the culmination of the smoother, more adult-oriented sound of the band's later work. The album peaked at number 2 in the UK charts, and achieved gold status from the BPI. It featured the singles \"It Didn't Matter\" and \"Waiting\", which had corresponding music videos. \"It Didn't Matter\" reached the top 10 in the UK charts, however \"Waiting\" failed to make the top 40, which was a first for any Style Council single. On release, The Cost of Loving received mixed reviews from music journalists. Today, the album is generally seen as a turning point in the band's career, leading to the sounds later explored on Confessions of a Pop Group and Modernism: A New Decade, whilst also signalling the start of the band's declining commercial and critical success. The band themselves have been quite vocal in being less satisfied with the album."@en ;

Among the performers was J.J. Cale, giving Clapton the opportunity to ask Cale to produce an album for him. The two started working together and eventually decided to record an album. A number of high-profile musicians also agreed to work on the album, including Billy Preston, Derek Trucks, Taj Mahal, Pino Palladino, John Mayer, Steve Jordan and Doyle Bramhall II. In a coup, whether intended or not, the entire John Mayer Trio participated on this album in one capacity or another. Escondido is a city near Cale's hometown of Valley Center, California, in San Diego County. Eric Clapton owned a mansion in Escondido in the 1980s and early '90s. Cale and Clapton thought it would be a good name for the album because of their dual acquaintanceship with the city. The album won the Grammy Award for Best Contemporary Blues Album in 2008."@en ;

The album was mixed and mastered to bring out harshness and loudness, trying to replicate the tension and the intensity of the live shows of the \"Defrosted\" P-MODEL as perceived by the band (in the liner notes Hirasawa recommends saying the band's traditional \"good evening\" greeting after the first three tracks are played). Remixes were also made by the \"Revised\" P-MODEL for their shows, but they didn't get a release like the \"Defrosted\" P-MODEL remixes did; the ENDING ERROR video release (and, to a lesser extent, the other two video releases of the \"Revised\" P-MODEL), which is composed mostly of older P-MODEL songs performed in the \"Revised\" style, somewhat served as a spiritual successor to The Way of LIVE.

Plaskett produced and recorded the album himself at his own Scotland Yard studio in Dartmouth, Nova Scotia. In addition to being released as a triple album, the number three is reflected in several other aspects of the album. Each disc has nine songs on it, many of which are titled with a single word or phrase repeated three times. The album's release date of 3/24/09 also consists of numbers divisible by three, the cover features an image of Plaskett holding three fingers up, and preorders through MapleMusic were distributed with access to exclusive tickets, priced at $66, which would entitle the purchaser to a seat in the first twelve rows of Plaskett's concert at Toronto's Massey Hall the night before the album's release. According to Plaskett, the discs tell a story of \"going away, being alone and coming home\", with each disc representing one of those three themes. Guest musicians on the album include singers Ana Egge and Rose Cousins, who were at the Folk Alliance festival in Memphis in 2007. The three of them tried jamming at Easley McCain Recording in Memphis, and Plaskett decided he wanted to have them on his new album and write parts for them. Plaskett's father, Bill, was also a significant contributor to the album, offering songwriting and arranging, vocals, and playing bouzouki, acoustic guitar, tenor guitar, and piano. The album was shortlisted for the 2009 Polaris Music Prize. It won Contemporary Album of the Year at the 2009 Canadian Folk Music Awards. In June 2009, Plaskett released a follow-up EP, entitled Three More, which contained three songs not featured on the original album. In 2010, Plaskett released a condensed version of Three called Three to One primarily for the non-Canadian market."@en ;

It was released on November 26, 2002, debuting at number 5 on the Billboard 200. This album is the second of two albums (The first being Until The End Of Time) that consists of a collection of previously unreleased material by way of remixed songs from Tupac's \"Makaveli\" period while signed to Death Row Records, and was produced by Johnny \"J\", Jazze Pha, Frank Nitty, and E.D.I. of Outlawz. It includes \"Military Minds\" which features Boot Camp Clik members Buckshot and Smif-n-Wessun (credited as Cocoa Brovaz) which was supposed to be part of a collaborative album between Shakur and BCC titled One Nation but was never officially released due to Shakur's death. Better Dayz has no censored references to Death Row Records unlike the previous album Until The End Of Time. The only track on the album pre-Deathrow era is My Block (remix)\". Recorded in 1994-1995 during Shakur's time with Interscope, the original version can be found on The Show (1995 Soundtrack). It features 23 unreleased recordings from the period 1994-1996, the majority of which are remixed. Others retain their original form or are complete finished mixes, such as \"Fuck 'Em All\", \"Late Night\", \"Ghetto Star\", \"Better Dayz\", \"Who Do U Believe In?\" and \"They Don't Give A Fuck About Us\". The album features appearances by Outlawz, Ron Isley, Nas, M\u00FDa, Jazze Pha, Tyrese and among others.

dbr:Dog_Man_Star	rdf:type	schema:MusicAlbum ;
	dbo:abstract	"Dog Man Star is the second album by English alternative rock band Suede, released in October 1994 on Nude Records. The album was recorded in London at Master Rock studios in early 1994 and was produced by Ed Buller. It was the last Suede album to feature guitarist Bernard Butler, due to growing tensions between him and singer Brett Anderson ending with Butler leaving the band before the album was completed. Dog Man Star is darker than debut album Suede and chronicles the band as they eschewed from the \"Britpop pack\". In contrast to that album which highly emulated the influences of David Bowie and the Smiths, Dog Man Star exhibits an individualistic aesthetic, drawing from a wider range of influences. Although it did not sell on the same scale as their chart-topping debut, Dog Man Star reached number three on the UK Albums Chart and was certified as gold by the BPI in November 1994. The grandiose, ambitious, and heavily orchestrated album was greeted with enthusiastic reviews but muted commercial response, however it is now considered by many to be Suede's masterpiece. On release it was relatively unknown in the mainstream, although the album has over time garnered universal acclaim from critics. This recognition was helped by Suede's 2010 reunion, which further solidified the album as one of the greatest of all time. In October 2013, NME magazine placed the album at number 31 in its list of the 500 greatest albums of all time."@en ;

dbr:Haughty_Melodic	rdf:type	schema:MusicAlbum ;
	dbo:abstract	"Haughty Melodic is an album by Mike Doughty released on May 3, 2005. Doughty described the album as \"a bunch of songs about yearning and redemption and happiness and hope.\" The album's sound is dense, stuffed full of multi-tracked guitars, horns, keyboards, and Doughty's own voice multiplied over himself in harmony; a departure both from the sounds of Soul Coughing and Doughty's solo acoustic work. It was gradually recorded over the course of two years at the home of producer Dan Wilson (of Semisonic). In contrast to his previous stripped-down releases, Doughty brought in many other musicians to record Haughty Melodic, including multi-instrumentalist Shahzad Ismaily, upright bass player John Munson, and N.E.R.D. drummer Eric Fawcett. On Amazon.com, iTunes, and other places online that carried listener reviews, the record was either trashed with indignant one star reviews that decried it as overproduced, or defended passionately by fans that lavished four or five stars on it. Some fans, many new ones brought in by the single \"Looking at the World from the Bottom of a Well\"\u2014peculiarly, a radio hit based on a scene from Haruki Murakami's novel The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle\u2014were struck by the imagery drawn from Doughty's recovery from drug addiction, and the album's themes of loss and redemption. The album's arduous process began when Doughty flew out to Minneapolis to collaborate with Wilson on a bridge for his anti-WTO song \"Busting Up a Starbucks.\" Wilson and Doughty had been set up by their mutual manager, Jim Grant. The two wrote the song \"American Car,\" and made simple demos of guitar, piano and drum machine, which inspired Doughty so much that he tapped Wilson to produce a full album\u2014despite the fact that he had no label and would have to weave recording sessions periodically in Wilson's busy schedule. Doughty would fly out to Minnesota every few weeks for a session\u2014a few days here, a couple of weeks there\u2014and as the album gradually took shape it departed from those initial, sparse demos; in the time between sessions Doughty and Wilson would conceive new parts, new instrumentation, ideas for replacing one part for another. Doughty has remarked that he felt tortured by the stop-and-start process of constant re-examination, but in the end believed that the album achieved a kind of perfection through the time and scrutiny."@en ;

During 1973, Oldfield was uncomfortable with the public attention that he had received from the success of Tubular Bells, and retreated to the English countryside to work on his follow-up. The result was Hergest Ridge, named for the hill near Kington, Herefordshire on the border between England and Wales, and near where he was living at the time. Hergest Ridge entered the UK album charts at number one, only to be displaced by its predecessor, Tubular Bells. Oldfield is thus one of only a few artists (among whom are The Beatles and Bob Dylan) to have defeated themselves in this manner."@en ;

Before he founded Enigma, Cretu had released several solo records, collaborated with various artists, and produced albums from his then wife, German pop singer Sandra. Following their marriage in 1988, Cretu developed an idea for a New-age music project named Enigma. MCMXC a.D. was recorded in eight months in 1990 at A.R.T. Studios located in Cretu's home in Ibiza, Spain. It is one of the first albums recorded onto a hard disk drive. Cretu makes extensive use of Gregorian chants, dance beats, and flute sounds. MCMXC a.D. received some criticism for its sexual and religious themes and connotations. Nevertheless, the album was a worldwide success, reaching the top 10 in ten countries, including the UK, and No. 6 in the U.S. where it sold over 4 million copies and stayed on the Billboard 200 chart for 282 weeks. Four singles from the album were released\u2014\"Sadeness (Part I)\", \"Mea Culpa (Part II)\", \"Principles of Lust\", and \"The Rivers of Belief\". \"Sadeness (Part 1)\" was the most successful single which topped the singles charts in several countries.

This made the album Feeder's most successful in terms of peak chart position, but did not experience the same chart longetivity as presuccessor Comfort in Sound, which spent 36 weeks on the UK top 75 chart in comparison to the 15 weeks spent by Pushing the Senses. The album represented a similar musical style as seen on 2002's Comfort in Sound, and featured more songs written on a piano and also had, as described by frontman Grant Nicholas, more of an \"organic\" sound than that of the latter. Inspirations were that of John Lennon within some of the songwriting. Most critics criticised the band's approach to what was described as Keane and Coldplay style music, and \"departing\" from their trademark sound heard on their first three albums, while Q magazine stated that the album could \"finally establish Feeder as major league players\"."@en ;

Most of the album is sung in the affected country crooning voice that Dylan had introduced a year earlier on Nashville Skyline. Seen by some as intentionally surreal and even satirical at times, Self Portrait received extremely poor reviews upon release; Greil Marcus' opening sentence in his Rolling Stone review was: \"What is this shit?\" Dylan has claimed in interviews that Self Portrait was something of a joke, far below the standards he set in the 1960s, and was made to get people off his back and end the \"spokesman of a generation\" tags. Despite the negative reception, the album quickly went gold in the U.S., where it hit No. 4, and it gave Dylan yet another UK No. 1 hit before it fell down the charts. The album has since built a cult following and saw a retrospective positive re-evaluation with the release of The Bootleg Series Vol. 10: Another Self Portrait (1969\u20131971) in 2013.[citation needed]"@en ;

Though it was not as well-received as his previous solo effort, Avalanche, it quickly achieved Gold certification in Canada. Recording sessions for White Light Rock & Roll Review began less than a year after the release of Avalanche, making it the shortest time spent between records for Good. Having become disenchanted with the state of recorded music, Good became enamored with the techniques employed by classic artists like Led Zeppelin and The Who, who spent much of their careers perfecting their live shows and recording albums live off the floor. To this end, Good sought to write songs that could best be conveyed to live audiences. In fact, many of the record's tracks (including \"Little Terror\", \"North American for Life\", \"Blue Skies Over Bad Lands\", \"It's Been A While Since I Was Your Man\", and \"Ex-Pats of the Blue Mountain Symphony Orchestra\") were written and performed live, well in advance of the album's release."@en ;

It is Peter Gabriel's fourteenth album project overall. In production for more than 18 years, \"Big Blue Ball\" is a project featuring several artists from all around the world working together. Gabriel said that although the initial recording was finished by 1995, \"the tapes were left in a mess and it's taken this long to sort out.\" Producer Stephen Hague was finally called in to sort out the project. Guests on the album include Wendy Melvoin of Wendy & Lisa, Sin\u00E9ad O'Connor, Karl Wallinger (of World Party), Natacha Atlas, and Papa Wemba. Gabriel takes the lead vocals on several tracks on the album. A mix of western, African, and Asian musicians are also included. Big Blue Ball was launched in America in June, 24th, 2008. \"After all these years, it's a fine wine ready to be drunk,\" says Peter Gabriel, \"It was the most fun music making I've ever had.\" It was released thanks to a venture-capital trust initiative. Bosses at London-based firm Ingenious raised more than $4 million (\u00A32 million) to help promote the release in the US. The venture capitalists, Gabriel, and his Real World Limited partners, created a new joint venture company, High Level Recordings Limited, to oversee the release of the album. The new album deal covers the North America territory, where Gabriel is currently out of contract. The worldwide distribution of the album will be dealt by Proper Music Distribution. The first track released from the project was \"Whole Thing\", included on the soundtrack album for the TV series, Long Way Down. A version of \"Burn You Up, Burn You Down\" was also included on Gabriel's 2003 compilation album Hit, with a radio edit released as a single. There are two CD editions of the album with different covers; the music is the same on both. A limited edition of 1000 copies of the album was released on blue vinyl, from Rykodisc. The digital download versions of the album contain different bonus content depending on the country. UK download stores include the track \"Whole Thing (Adrian Sherwood & Jazzwad Remix)\". US download stores include the track \"Habibe (Stefan Goodchild Remix)\" and a digital booklet. Both versions include the \"Story of the Big Blue Ball, Pt. 1\" video."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Don't Come Home A-Drinkin' (With Lovin' on Your Mind) is the seventh studio album released by American country singer-songwriter, Loretta Lynn. The album was released in 1967. Don't Come Home A-Drinkin was released shortly after the release of the title track in late 1966. The lead single peaked at #1 on the Billboard Country Chart, Lynn's first #1 hit on the chart. The album became the first album by a female Country singer to be certified \"Gold\" by the RIAA, meaning the album has sold 500,000 copies or more. \"Don't Come Home A' Drinkin'\" was the only single release off the album. Two tracks were released for Lynn's first of two 1967 regular studio albums. The album includes a cover version of \"There Goes My Everything\". Besides the lead single, Lynn wrote or co-wrote two songs for the album, \"I Got Caught\" and \"Get What 'Cha Got and Go\". Allmusic gave Lynn's album a positive review, rating it five stars and calling her choice of selecting cover versions as something that \"suits her perfectly\", including her cover version of Ernest Tubb's \"The Shoe Goes on the Other Foot Tonight\". As Lynn was beginning to get more control of her albums, she began to write more of her singles herself. This album set the trend for the future albums Lynn would record. The album peaked at #1 on the Billboard Top Country Albums chart, her second album to do so. It also peaked at #80 on the Billboard 200."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Guilty Until Proven Insane is the fourth studio album released by Skyhooks on March 13, 1978. It was the first album that featured Bob Spencer, who replaced guitarist Red Symons in early 1977. Spencer originally played in Sydney rock band Finch and was later was a member of The Angels. Originally released as a 12\" vinyl LP and also on red vinyl as a 5000-copy limited release, it was later released on CD in 1997. It is the first album to include an uncensored version of \"Why Dontcha All Get Fucked\" recorded in a studio, as opposed to live and censored versions. It is also the last album vocalist Graeme \"Shirley\" Strachan made with Skyhooks before reuniting with them for the recording sessions featured on The Lost Album. Only two singles were released from the album. \"Women in Uniform\" was a Top 10 hit nationwide, while \"Meglomania\" barely made the Top 100. Live favorites were \"BBBBBBBBBBBBBBoogie\", \"Hotel Hell\" and \"Why Doncha All Get Fucked\". \"Women in Uniform\" was covered 2 years later in 1980 by the heavy metal group Iron Maiden. The album is no longer in regular print, thus numbers have dwindled largely and is now considered a rare item, much like the follow-up album Hot for the Orient. The album's name comes from a line in \"Twisted Innocence\", which states 'if I'm guilty until proven insane...'. The sixth track in the album, \"Hotel Hell\", is currently being used on the FOX reality series Hotel Hell starring Gordon Ramsay."@en ;

A double album, III/IV was recorded prior to bassist Catherine Popper's departure, and also marks guitarist and backing vocalist Neal Casal's recording debut for the band. According to Adams, the album remained unreleased until 2010, as his former label, Lost Highway, had previously rejected it.

	dbo:abstract	"Long Way to Heaven is the fifth studio album by the Canadian heavy metal band Helix. This album was their third for Capitol Records, and there were bigger expectations from the band after the success of the previous Walkin' the Razor's Edge (featuring the hit \"Rock You\"). The first single was \"Deep Cuts the Knife\", cowritten by Paul Hackman and Bob Halligan, Jr. The song received heavy airplay in the U.S., gaining \"double breaker\" status, and in Canada was added to heavy video play on MuchMusic. Q107 in Toronto had the song riding at #1 for several weeks on their \"Top Ten at Ten\". Their first tour to kick off the album was in Sweden where they became the first Canadian rock band ever to tour that country extensively. For this they achieved their first #1 album in that country. Returning to North America, they toured with Accept and Keel, as well as headlining dates. They also played odd one-off dates with Meat Loaf and Heart. While headlining in Newfoundland, a local band called KAOS opened for Helix. This band featured Rainer and Cindy Wiechmann, who joined Helix 19 years later in 2004, on lead guitar and backup vocals respectively. The second single released from the album was \"The Kids Are all Shakin'\", a song inspired by a fan letter from Poland. The album went platinum in Canada and they headlined their first Canadian tour with the Headpins as the supporting act. The Long Way to Heaven album was released for the first time on CD in September 1999."@en ;

The compilation gathers material from Harry's four solo albums for the Chrysalis label, KooKoo, Rockbird, Def, Dumb & Blonde, and Debravation; and unlike 1998's Deborah Harry Collection, it contains most of the singles issued between the years 1981 and 1993, including Harry's biggest solo hits \"French Kissin' in the USA\" and \"I Want That Man\". Most of All also includes non-album singles like \"Rush Rush\", \"Feel the Spin\", and her 1990 duet with Iggy Pop, \"Well, Did You Evah!\", as well alternative single mixes not available on the regular studio albums. With the new millennium only one month away, EMI issued remixed dance versions of Harry's 1989 hit \"I Want That Man\" to promote the album, with the updated mixes by D-Bop and Almighty both cleverly accentuating the first line of the chorus: \"...here comes the twenty-first century....\".

The album was then rereleased and remastered on Vinyl in 2015, with only 3,000 copies made. Like Maladroit the marketing of this EP caused a rift with Weezer's record label Geffen Records. The band wanted an eight-song EP with a unique packaging that wouldn't involve crystal cases. Geffen told the band that the packaging idea was too expensive and the number of songs on the EP needed to be reduced from eight songs to six as to not upset the other retailers who wouldn't be getting the disc. The artwork and packaging stuck but the disc's length was reduced to six songs including a \"hidden track.\" This hidden track was an instrumental track titled \"Polynesia\" that opens the disc."@en ;

Over an hour in length, the release contains one new song, two covers and two re-recorded tracks from the band's early demos. It was stated that this release is categorized as an EP so that it will not be interpreted as the band's new album. The title track is divided into nine \"chapters\" in the lyric sheet, which do not always correspond with the sequence of progression between musical themes. The music deviates from chapter to chapter, from brutal black metal to acoustic folk rhythms. The remake of \"Taistelu Pohjolasta\" does not incorporate the opening section of the original piece (which appeared on T\u00E4m\u00E4 Ikuinen Talvi); thus, the only movements incorporated are \"Punaisen Lumen Valtakunta\" and \"J\u00E4isten J\u00E4rvien Kimalteessa.\" The remake of \"Hvergelmir,\" however, does include the coda \"Elivagar (Pakanavedet),\" accompanied by a spoken monologue in Swedish that does not appear in the original."@en ;

Given that all tracks on the album were previously unreleased Personal File is considered both a posthumous album and a compilation.

The album was compiled and produced by Gregg Geller with liner notes by Greil Marcus. On most of the tracks, Cash performs alone, accompanying himself on guitar, and on many tracks Cash prefaces the song with remarks about its history and what it means to him. In 2007, Legacy released a sequel, More Songs from Johnny's Personal File, featuring additional private recordings. The first album was reissued in 2011 by Legacy under the revised title Bootleg Vol. 1: Personal File, which was followed by three more volumes of unreleased or rare recordings.

	dbo:abstract	"5:55 is the second album by French musician and actress Charlotte Gainsbourg. It is also her first album release in twenty years. Charlotte collaborated on the album with French duo Air, English musician Jarvis Cocker, and Irish singer-songwriter Neil Hannon, as well as Radiohead's main producer Nigel Godrich. \"The Songs That We Sing\" and \"5:55\" were released as singles. The album went platinum in France, selling over 500,000 copies. In the United States, the album sold a modest 22,000 copies. \"The Songs That We Sing\" was #78 on Rolling Stone's list of the 100 Best Songs of 2007. In order to distance herself from her famous father and mother (Serge Gainsbourg and Jane Birkin),[citation needed] Charlotte decided to sing most of the album in English (leaving only one song in French, \"Tel Que Tu Es\", meaning \"Such As You Are\"). Critics have been very positive in France, describing this effort as a total achievement from all points of view.[who?] English critics have been more mixed, saying that Charlotte's second album does not sound all that different compared with the work of her parents. Notably, Pitchfork Media's review described the album's erotic lyrical content as reminiscent of Serge Gainsbourg's, and Charlotte's vocal approach as highly similar to that of her mother. The first single, \"The Songs That We Sing\" was also included in the soundtrack to the 2009 film The Uninvited."@en ;

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/7_Park_Avenue>	rdf:type	schema:MusicAlbum ;
	dbo:abstract	"7 Park Avenue is the first of two posthumous CD releases of demo material recorded by Badfinger's Pete Ham. The recordings are taken from various eras, beginning with compositions he wrote during his years with The Iveys from 1967 to 1969, and running throughout his tenure with Badfinger, ending with his death in 1975.The majority of these recordings were made on The Iveys' Sound-On-Sound Revox mono tape machine. Many of the songs highlight Ham playing all the instruments. However, session musicians occasionally augment some of the tracks, most notably former Badfinger member Bob Jackson and former Iveys member, Ron Griffiths. All of the vocals and guitar licks are Ham's original performances. A follow-up disc of Ham demo material, Golders Green, was released two years after this release. 7 Park Avenue was the address of Badfinger's band residence in Golders Green. Golders Green is a community in London, England, probably most known for the Golders Green Crematorium which is the final resting place for many famous Brits including The Who drummer Keith Moon, famed psychoanalyst Sigmund Freud, and comedic actor Peter Sellers, star of the 1960s Pink Panther movies. The following track listing represents the US and UK issues. The Japanese CD issue contains five bonus tracks here.

dbr:Citizen_Steely_Dan	rdf:type	schema:MusicAlbum ;
	dbo:abstract	"Citizen Steely Dan is a four-CD box set compilation album by Steely Dan, released in 1993. The set is a collection of all of Steely Dan's albums (up to 1993) in chronological order, and also contains a non-album single (\"FM (No Static at All)\"), a non-album B-side (\"Bodhisattva (Live)\"), a rare compilation track recorded during the sessions for The Royal Scam but released only on the 1978 Greatest Hits (\"Here at the Western World\"), and a previously unreleased demo of \"Everyone's Gone to the Movies\" (a song from their 1975 album Katy Lied). The set is not, however, a complete compilation of every track released by Steely Dan up to 1993. Missing are both sides of the band's 1972 debut single (\"Dallas\" b/w \"Sail the Waterway\"), neither of which has ever been re-issued on CD. This is due to the band's dislike of the songs and refusal to allow them to be reissued. Until 1998, this was the only place to find the remastered versions of the Steely Dan albums. However, because the albums were split up irregularly amongst the discs (in some cases with the track order changed), the remastered studio albums were issued in 1998, albeit without bonus tracks. The first pressing features \"Rikki Don't Lose That Number\" using the single edit of the song. This version omits the percussive opening for the song. The second pressing of the boxed set features the version from the album although it was reissued without any information noting the change. Glen Meadows remastered the CD set from the digital masters archived by Donald Fagen, Gary Katz and Roger Nichols in 1982. These digital tapes were prepared because the original analog tapes were in very poor shape. The earliest CD mastering for all the Steely Dan albums in 1985 used these digital tapes but MCA inexplicably used deteriorating analog masters for all later CD pressings until the 1998 remasters. This information was discovered by Roger Nichols in 1991 when he was asked his opinion of the Mobile Fidelity Gold reissues of Aja and Gaucho. Nichols discovered that the \"Gaucho CD was even a different speed, about a quarter tone sharper\" when compared to the original CD that he was involved in. The 1993 boxed set remaster was the first time since the originally issued CDs that the albums used the correct source tape."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Grand Unification is the debut studio album by British alternative rock band Fightstar, released on 13 March 2006 through Island Records. Based upon the Neon Genesis Evangelion franchise, Grand Unification was produced by Colin Richardson and is considered a concept album. The track \"Lost Like Tears in Rain\", contains the line, \"It's Neon Genesis\" to support the band's interest in the anime series. The artwork, drawn digitally by Daniel Conway, also portrays scenes similar to that of the ruined cities in Evangelion. It is also thought to believe the cover has taken influence from the song 'Grand Unification Part 2' as the lyric \"hold my hand until the waves come\" and the cover features two persons holding hands waiting for what appears to be a flood. The lyrics are themed around social commentary at the end of the world, while the album's title refers to the Human Instrumentality Project. Preceded by the singles, \"Paint Your Target\" and \"Waste a Moment\", the album debuted at number twenty eight on the UK Albums Chart and garnered positive critical reviews. Two further singles were released from the album; \"Grand Unification Pt. I\" and \"Hazy Eyes\", before the album was released overseas in North America through Trustkill Records."@en ;

The series began as a handheld side story to Square's flagship franchise Final Fantasy, although most Final Fantasy-inspired elements were subsequently dropped, starting with the second installment, Secret of Mana. It has since grown to include games of various genres within the fictional world of Mana.

Each game except for Friends and Circle has produced a soundtrack album, while Adventure has sparked an arranged album as well as a combined soundtrack and arranged album, Legend of Mana has an additional promotional EP, and music from Secret and Seiken Densetsu 3 were combined together into an arranged album. For the series' 20th anniversary, a 20-disc box set of previously-released albums was produced, as well as an album of arrangements by Kenji Ito, composer for several games in the series. The music of Final Fantasy Adventure was composed by Kenji Ito, while Hiroki Kikuta composed Secret of Mana and Seiken Densetsu 3 and Yoko Shimomura wrote the score to Legend of Mana. The music of the World of Mana subseries, composed of Children, Dawn, Friends, and Heroes of Mana, was composed by many different composers, with Ito, Kikuta, Shimomura, Tsuyoshi Sekito, Masayoshi Soken, and Ryuichi Sakamoto composing Dawn, Ito, Masaharu Iwata, and Takayuki Aihara writing Children, and Shimomura composing the music of Friends and Heroes. Rise of Mana was composed by an ensemble group including Ito, Kikuta, Shimomura, Sekito, Yasuhiro Yamanaka, and Kokia. Music from the series has been performed in live concerts such as the Orchestral Game Concerts and the Symphonic Game Music Concerts, and made up one fourth of the Symphonic Fantasies concert in Cologne, Germany. Music from the Mana series has also been arranged for the piano and published as sheet music books."@en ;
