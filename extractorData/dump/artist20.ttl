	dbo:abstract	"Bryan Gregory (Gregory Beckerleg, February 20, 1951 \u2013 January 10, 2001) was an American rock musician, and founding member of and guitarist for The Cramps. Gregory took the name Bryan after Brian Jones from The Rolling Stones whom he was a big fan of. He met Cramps member Lux Interior at a mutual job they shared at a record store in NYC. He shared his birthday with fellow member Poison Ivy. Bryan took up second guitar in April 1976 and was a distinctive sight in the early incarnation of the Cramps, along with his sister Pam Balaam (Pam Beckerleg) on drums. He was known for his oozing guitar sound, wild stage antics, and long black and white striped hair. He appeared on The Cramps first two albums Gravest Hits and Songs the Lord Taught Us. He abruptly left the band in 1980, with a van full of most of the band's equipment; no police report or proof was established. He was later replaced by Kid Congo Powers from the Gun Club. A rumor circulated that he had left to pursue an interest in Satanism, but Poison Ivy maintained that it was more likely due to his addiction to heroin. After the Cramps, Gregory went on to play in Beast from 1980-1983. Bryan collaborated with producer Robyn Hunt an Australian whom he married in Cleveland, Ohio. March 6, 1984, it also included film volunteers to make \"Frezzer\", an alien horror host, with writer Char Rao, a former Cramps associate who played in the video, it never took off after they moved to Florida. He played a zombie in George Romero's Day of the Dead with fellow zombie fans Mike Metoff (Pagans guitarist and, at the time, temporary guitarist with The Cramps) and Char Rao in Pittsburgh. After moving to Florida he successfully managed an adult book store in Sarasota, Florida where he settled for several years and joined his sister Pam Beckerleg in Osprey, Florida, after his amicable divorce. Gregory had a social reunion with Lux, Ivy & Nick backstage at a Cramps show in St. Petersburg, Florida in the early 1990s. Lux dedicated the last song of the night to Bryan. Gregory moved to Los Angeles forming The Dials from 1992\u20131995 joining Shiver with former musicians James Christ and Andrella (former band members of Beast and The Veil). At the time of his death Gregory had been losing interest in his music goals. He reported he was feeling \"exhausted and run down\", according to his ex-wife Hunt (with whom he remained close friends), having put it down to working nights and taking care of a sick friend full-time. Gregory drove himself to the emergency room for a check up at 4 a.m. Once there, he was transferred to another hospital, Anaheim Memorial Medical Center, Anaheim, California, where suddenly and unexpectedly he was felled by a multiple systems failure. His brother Rick Beckerleg, a Vietnam veteran and fireman from Detroit, Michigan, was by his side at his death. He was also close to his sister Pam Beckerleg, whom he referred to as \"Little Wing\" (a tattoo he wore in her honor). Gregory was an avid science fiction and horror film fan, and especially fond of characters such as Frankenstein's Monster. In addition to his love of music he also designed jewellery, did charcoal drawings, clothing art design, theater makeup and horror costume design in Cleveland, Ohio and Florida. Gregory supported Native American causes and was reported by his mother (now deceased) to be a descendant of Civil War general William Sherman. Although his religious background was Catholic in his youth, he experimented in several religious cults and found them unsatisfactory. Gregory's ashes are buried at Rose Hills Memorial Park in Whittier, California."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Daniel Monte McLain (May 11, 1955 \u2013 November 8, 1995), known by the stage name Country Dick Montana, was a musician best known as a member of The Beat Farmers. Montana was born in Carmel, California. In the 1970s, he owned a record store called Monty Rockers and was a member of two seminal San Diego bands. He drummed for both punk rock pioneers The Penetrators and roots rock band The Crawdaddys. From 1983 to 1995, Montana played drums, percussion, guitar and accordion for The Beat Farmers. He also performed lead vocals on at least one song on every Beat Farmers album, singing humorous songs frequently related to drinking. The song \"Happy Boy\" was popular on The Dr. Demento Radio Show and featured in several feature films. Montana was also famous for his onstage antics, frequently related to drinking. During this time, he was also in the short-lived trio the Pleasure Barons with Mojo Nixon and Dave Alvin, The Incredible Hayseeds, Country Dick's Petting Zoo, and Country Dick's Garage. Prior to forming the Beat Farmers, McLain put together a band called Country Dick & the Snuggle Bunnies which included an array of San Diego talent, most of whom would play major roles in the Beat Farmers legacy. The band included: Dan McLain (aka Country Dick Montana), drums/vocals; Richard Banke (aka Skid Roper), mandolin/washboard/vocals; Robin Jackson, guitar/vocals; Paul Kamanski, guitar/vocals; Joey Harris, guitar/vocals; and Nino Del Pesco, bass/vocals. In 1995, Montana suffered a heart attack and died while playing \"The Girl I Almost Married\" during a Beat Farmers show at the Longhorn Saloon in Whistler, British Columbia, Canada. The band disbanded shortly thereafter. \"The Ballad of Country Dick\" by Mojo Nixon was written after his death. The song \"Happy Boy\" was written by Dane Conover, formerly of the Puppies\u2014the band in which Del Pesco played bass prior to joining Country Dick & the Snuggle Bunnies. Conover would later go on to form Trees. In 1996, the posthumous solo album The Devil Lied To Me was released. A reference to Montana can be found in the 1997 First Person Shooter video game, Redneck Rampage. In the game, his \"tombstone\" appears in a graveyard on the 12th level, complete with the words, \"the devil lied to me\" as his epitaph, which refers to his 1996 posthumous album."@en ;

Franklin's church as a child. In 1960, at the age of 18, Franklin embarked on a secular career, recording for Columbia Records but only achieving modest success. Following her signing to Atlantic Records in 1967, Franklin achieved commercial acclaim and success with songs such as \"Respect\", \"(You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman\" and \"Think\". These hits and more helped her to gain the title The Queen of Soul by the end of the 1960s decade. Franklin eventually recorded a total of 112 charted singles on Billboard, including 77 Hot 100 entries, 17 top ten pop singles, 100 R&B entries and twenty number-one R&B singles, becoming the most charted female artist in the chart's history. Franklin also recorded acclaimed albums such as I Never Loved a Man the Way I Love You, Lady Soul, Young, Gifted & Black and Amazing Grace before experiencing problems with her record company by the mid-1970s. After her father was shot in 1979, Franklin left Atlantic and signed with Arista Records, finding success with her part in the film The Blues Brothers and with the albums Jump to It and Who's Zoomin' Who?. In 1998, Franklin won international acclaim for singing the opera aria \"Nessun dorma\", at the Grammys of that year replacing Luciano Pavarotti. Later that same year, she scored her final Top 40 recording with \"A Rose Is Still a Rose\". Franklin's other popular and well known hits include \"Rock Steady\", \"Something He Can Feel\" (from the soundtrack to the 1976 film Sparkle), \"Jump to It\", \"Freeway of Love\", \"Who's Zoomin' Who\", \"Sisters Are Doin' It for Themselves\", \"I Knew You Were Waiting (For Me)\" (with George Michael), \"It Isn't, It Wasn't, It Ain't Never Gonna Be\" (with Whitney Houston) and a remake of The Rolling Stones song \"Jumpin' Jack Flash\". Franklin has won a total of 18 Grammy Awards and is one of the best-selling artists of all time, having sold over 75 million records worldwide. Franklin has been honored throughout her career including a 1987 induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, in which she became the first female performer to be inducted. She was inducted to the UK Music Hall of Fame in 2005. In August 2012, Franklin was inducted into the GMA Gospel Music Hall of Fame.

	dbo:abstract	"Digby Pearson, also known as \"Dig,\" (born 1962) is a British musician and businessman who founded Earache Records, which signed some of the most infamous heavy metal acts worldwide in the 1980s and early 1990s. He was raised in Nottingham, UK  where he began playing music focusing on heavy metal. He played for a while in the DIY punk band Scum Dribblurzzz, who never released any records or accepted payment for playing shows. In the mid-80s, he founded Earache, and gradually began releasing records. He says the first year of business, 1986, was spent doing very little. He claims he initially set up the label as a way to continue to claim social security benefits without having to go to the unemployment office every two weeks - \"I didn't fancy doing that\". He started releasing flexi-discs, and then moved on to putting out a split between Concrete Sox and Heresy, and an album by the Acc\u00FCsed. In 1987 he compiled two sessions by different line-ups of the band Napalm Death, and released them as the album Scum. The album proved popular, peaking at 7 on the indie chart and receiving airplay on John Peel's show on BBC Radio 1. Both Napalm Death and Heresy are considered to be pioneering grindcore bands. As his business success grew he signed relatively unknown acts such as Bolt Thrower, Carcass, Cathedral, Godflesh, Anal Cunt, Entombed, Morbid Angel and many others throughout the 1980s. Into the 1990s, Sony Music expected death metal and grindcore to be \"the next big thing\" and Earache Records licensed Earache's main bands such as Cathedral, Fudge Tunnel and Carcass to Sony. When the success never occurred Earache was without its main acts and Cathedral and Carcass were left in label limbo. Digby pushed on and signed acts such as Deicide, Mortiis, and The Berzerker, as well as releasing more techno oriented music and reissues of the label's earlier albums. In 2015, Pearson won the \"Pioneer Award\" from the AIM Independent Music Awards."@en .

His biggest career hit song, \"Walking the Floor Over You\" (1941), marked the rise of the honky tonk style of music. In 1948, he was the first singer to record a hit version of \"Blue Christmas\", a song more commonly associated with Elvis Presley and his mid-1950s version. Another well-known Tubb hit was \"Waltz Across Texas\" (1965) (written by his nephew Quanah Talmadge Tubb (Billy Talmadge)), which became one of his most requested songs and is often used in dance halls throughout Texas during waltz lessons. Tubb recorded duets with the then up-and-coming Loretta Lynn in the early 1960s, including their hit \"Sweet Thang\". Tubb is a member of the Country Music Hall of Fame."@en .

The album's third single, \"Run the Show\", became a hit in various territories, and reached number two on the Hot Dance Club Play chart. Following the commercial performance of her first album, DeLuna was dropped from Epic Records. DeLuna continued to record both collaborations and soundtrack singles. DeLuna later began working on her second studio album, Inside Out (2010), which received a limited release through Universal Music Belgium. The album spawned a number of singles, notably \"Unstoppable\", \"Push Push\", and \"Dancing Tonight\" featuring Lil Wayne, Akon, and Fo Onassis respectively. Viva, the North American edition of the album, was slated to be released later that year; however, this never materialized. DeLuna is currently working on her third studio album, slated to be released in 2015. In 2007, DeLuna won \"Best New Artist\" at the Los Premios MTV Latinoam\u00E9rica 2007 awards.

	dbo:abstract	"Kevin Michael McMahon (born September 21, 1953 in Cleveland, Ohio) is a musician, singer, and songwriter for the long-standing bands Lucky Pierre and Prick. McMahon began recording with his new wave group Lucky Pierre in 1974, releasing a number of vinyl singles though 1981. Lucky Pierre initially consisted of: John Guciardo- Lead Guitar, Brian Dempsey- Drums, Dennis DeVito- Bass and McMahon on Guitar & Lead Vocals. In 1976, Tom Lash joined the band on bass guitar, and DeVito moved to guitar. Tom Miller played keyboards at this time. In 1977, Dempsey left the band and was replaced by drummer Gary Shay, and then drummer Dave Zima. After many live shows, both Tom Miller and John Gusciardo left Cleveland for California and DeVito switched to lead guitar. Many showcase concerts, radio broadcasts, and a few 45RPM singles followed. Lucky Pierre continued as a four-piece outfit, sometimes augmented by horns and vocalists to perform the array of song styles McMahon was developing. McMahon then went on hiatus until 1988, when Lucky Pierre recorded the Communiqu\u00E9 EP with Guciardo, Lash, Zima, and friend Trent Reznor making guest appearances. The 1988 line-up of Lucky Pierre included Trent Reznor (then of the Exotic Birds, later of Nine Inch Nails), and was managed by Exotic Birds/NIN manager John Malm, Jr.. Lucky Pierre disbanded again after the recording of Communiqu\u00E9, but McMahon remained in contact with Reznor and Malm. During the early 1990s, McMahon began his second musical project, the industrial rock band Prick. Prick was eventually signed to Reznor and Malm's Nothing Records label. The band's debut self-titled album was released in 1995, with Reznor producing four of the album's ten tracks. Prick's lead single, \"Animal,\" received high rotation on MuchMusic and MTV, and Prick opened the US leg of Nine Inch Nails and David Bowie's Outside tour. Nothing's parent label, Interscope Records, dropped Prick before McMahon could record a follow-up. In the wake of this setback, McMahon went on another years-long hiatus from music. Prick reemerged in 2002 with The Wreckard, independently released by McMahon over the Internet, and featuring many songs once slated for the second, canceled Nothing Records album. Two years later, McMahon released Lucky Pierre's first full album, ThinKing, again selling the album independently online. In October 2008, McMahon re-emerged with the hard-rock track \"Runaway Brain,\" this time under the moniker ( sic ). The song was available from the fansite  for a limited time, with a note in the MP3's metadata noting, \"prick or treat \u2013 derailing things to come from luckypierremusic \u2013 THIS NOVEMBER (or ...it all depends on the speed of green)\". In an interview released in March 2009 on the fansite  , McMahon talked about possible future releases, and also announced that  will be online again, with merchandising an re-releases of The Wreckard and ThinKing (in new packagings) for sale, and maybe re-mastered tracks of Lucky Pierre. On June 21, 2009, luckypierremusic.com went live, offering digital downloads, new and vintage shirts and hats, and new CDs. As alluded to previously, The Wreckard and ThinKing are being reissued, and the Fear of Blue and (sic) album and EP are also being released. All of the music can be obtained through a six-CD package which features a Prick Live CD only available as part of the package."@en ;

He belonged to Chishti\u2013Nizami Sufi order. He was born and died at Chachran and was buried at Mithankot. His mother died when he was five years old and he was orphaned around the age of twelve when his father, Khwaja Khuda Bakhsh, died. He was then brought up by his elder brother, Fakhr Jahan Uhdi, and grew to become a scholar and writer. He mastered Arabic, Persian, Urdu, Punjabi (Saraiki), Sindhi, and Braj Bhasha, and also wrote poems in Saraiki, Punjabi, Urdu, Sindhi, Persian, and Braj Bhasha. His most significant works include: \n*  Deewan-e-Farid (poem in Saraiki, 1882; in Punjabi, 1883 ; in Urdu, 1884) \n*  Manaqabe Mehboobia (prose, in Persian) He frequently uses the symbolism of desert. Sometimes he touched political affairs, opposing the British rule in Bahawalpur. The 20th century saw development of an entire branch of literary studies into the life and work of Khwaja Ghulam Farid, named faridiyat. Today, many religious and educational institutions in Pakistan and India are named after him (e.g., Government Khawaja Farid College in Rahimyar Khan, Pakistan) as are streets and town quarters. A Khwaja Ghulam Farid Award is awarded by the Government of Pakistan in literature, its recipients including Ismail Ahmedani, Noshi Gilani and others. In 2001, on Khwaja Ghulam Farid's birth centenary, Pakistan Post issued a memorial stamp."@en ;

He started skating in 1987 and started listening to Operation Ivy, Mc Rad, The Descendents & Odd Man Out because of the skate videos. Early in 1992 he and Nikola Sarcevic were members of a band named Seigmen, which was a punk rock band singing in Swedish. F\u00E4rm runs a studio named Soundlab Studios, which he started with the help of Mieszko Talarczyk the former lead singer of Swedish grindcore band Nasum. He was the inaugural drummer for Millencolin but soon switched to guitar when Millencolin's current drummer Fredrik Larzon joined the band in 1993. This change was made because most of Millencolin's songs required two guitars on stage to duplicate the studio recorded sounds. F\u00E4rm was also a more proficient guitarist than drummer.Currently, he lives in \u00D6rebro, Sweden. He's a vegetarian.Mathias plays most rhythm guitars on the first three Millencolin albums, but in the more recent albums, he performs most of the lead guitars, notably octave-style riffs and some solos."@en ;

Inversely, Kalma appears on the cover of Lordi's debut album, Get Heavy, even though he did not play a note on the record, where all bass was recorded by his predecessor, Magnum. Before the release of Lordi's 4th studio album Deadache, Kalma was the only bass player to be featured on a Lordi album that he had played on, now OX has done the same with the 4th album. Kalma has played some role in the first three albums of Lordi. Since Kalma left the band he has made two surprise guest appearances by joining the current line-up of Lordi on stage playing rhythm guitar at Nosturi and The Forum in 2006 during the last few encores. He later teamed with former Lordi drummer, Sampsa Astala, to form the band Stala & So, they competed to represent Finland in the 2011 Eurovision Song Contest. Niko played in 3 studio albums of Stala & So. Last was released in 2015."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"(For Jonas' self-titled albums, see Nicholas Jonas (album) and Nick Jonas (album).) Nicholas Jerry \"Nick\" Jonas (born September 16, 1992) is an American singer, songwriter, and actor. Jonas began acting in theater at the age of seven, and released his debut single in 2002. He released his eponymous debut album in 2004 to little success, though it did catch the attention of Columbia Records. Jonas opted to form a band with his older brothers, Joe and Kevin, known as the Jonas Brothers. The group released their debut studio album It's About Time through Columbia Records. The record failed to achieve commercial success, thus the group parted ways with their label. Their self-titled second studio album was released through Hollywood Records in 2007, and became their breakthrough record. The band became prominent figures on the Disney Channel during this time, gaining a large following through the network. The band starred in the widely successful film Camp Rock (2008). The release of the band's third studio album, A Little Bit Longer (2008), helped the band achieve further success; the album's lead single hit the top five on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. The release of their fourth studio album saw a decline in sales for the band, though was still fairly successful. Jonas and his brothers starred in the Disney Channel series JONAS in 2009 and 2010, though poor ratings led to its cancellation in 2010. It was later confirmed that the Jonas Brothers would be taking a hiatus, with Nick forming a new band known as Nick Jonas & the Administration. The band released one studio album in 2010, though it failed to achieve much commercial success. Following the release, Jonas opted to focus on work in theater, and also had a recurring role on the television series Smash. The Jonas Brothers briefly reunited in 2013, though officially parted ways due to creative differences. Jonas decided to return to his solo music career following the band's disbandment, and began work on his second studio album. He signed with Island Records, releasing Nick Jonas (2014) through the label. The album entered the top ten of the Billboard 200, while both of the album's singles entered the top twenty of the Billboard Hot 100. The project was re-released as Nick Jonas X2 in 2015. The release helped provide Jonas with a new public image, earning him the title of a \"sex symbol\". Jonas later co-founded Safehouse Records, a record label in conjunction with Island Records and Hollywood Records. Jonas released his third studio album, Last Year Was Complicated (2016), through the label. The project became his highest peaking entry as a solo artist on the Billboard 200, while the lead single was a top twenty hit on the Billboard Hot 100."@en ;

Born in Honolulu, Hawaii and raised in Louisville, Kentucky, she performed in various singing competitions and musicals before joining American rock band Days of the New as a backing vocalist and later becoming one of the members of the ill-fated girl group Eden's Crush in 2001. She rose to fame as the lead singer of the burlesque troupe turned-recording act, the Pussycat Dolls becoming one of the world's best-selling girl groups of all time. During their hiatus Scherzinger planned to embark on her solo career with Her Name is Nicole but was later shelved after four single failed to impact the charts. Following the disbandment of the Pussycat Dolls, Scherzinger became a judge for two seasons of The Sing-Off and in 2010 won the tenth season of Dancing with the Stars. In 2011 she released her debut studio album, Killer Love to moderate success and featured the top-ten hits \"Don't Hold Your Breath\" and \"Right There\".

At the 78th Academy Awards in 2006, Three 6 Mafia and Frayser Boy won the Academy Award for Best Original Song for It's Hard out Here for a Pimp. Crunchy left Three 6 Mafia over monetary disputes involving his desire to forward his solo career. Black\u2019s debut solo album entitled On My Own was released on September 19, 2006. Crunchy has said this album was released by DJ Paul and Juicy J without his permission. Crunchy\u2019s second solo album, From Me To You is also said to have been put out without his permission by DJ Paul and Juicy J. From Me To You reached 12 on the Billboard Top Heatseekers chart, 32 on the Top R&B/Hip-Hop chart, and 10 on the Billboard Top Rap albums chart. \"On My Own\" reached 3 on the Billboard Top Heatseekers chart, 163 on the Billboard 200, 15 on the Billboard Independent Albums chart, 28 on the Top R&B/Hip-Hop chart, and 13 on the Billboard Top Rap Albums chart. In 2013, Crunchy Black joined Da Mafia 6ix, a reincarnation of Three 6 Mafia with DJ Paul Koopsta Knicca and Gangsta Boo. He has a daughter named Ladee Pooh Carlton. Crunchy contributed heavily to Platinum albums When the Smoke Clears: Sixty 6, Sixty 1, and Most Known Unknown, as well as Gold albums Da Unbreakables, and Chapter 2: World Domination with Three 6 Mafia. Crunchy is known for g-walking, which he says he started doing in Memphis Clubs but admits he is not the originator.

A girl group who was managed in Moscow, Russia by Ivan Shapovalov in March 1999, the group signed a record deal with Universal Music Russia, where they eventually signed to Universal's sub-label Interscope Records in 2001. The group's first single \"All the Things She Said\" topped the charts in countries including Australia, Austria, Denmark, Italy, Japan, New Zealand, Switzerland, the United States, and the United Kingdom, but also received controversy due to Julia and Lena kissing onscreen. The group recorded three studio albums in English, including their best-selling (to date) studio album, 200 km/h in the Wrong Lane, three Russian albums, and four compilation albums. The group also worked on alternative projects, including a 2011 film You and I, and opened a Russian-based record label entitled T.A. Music. Suddenly, in March 2011, t.A.T.u.'s management released a press release officially stating that t.A.T.u. had split, due to conflict and problems surrounding the members. Julia signed a solo career with Gala Records in June 2011, and released her debut single \"All Because of You\" in October 2011. The song was also released in a Russian-language version under the title \"\u0421\u0434\u0432\u0438\u043D\u0443 \u043C\u0438\u0440\" (I'll Change the World).

	dbo:abstract	"Andrew Kennedy \"Andy\" Irvine (born 14 June 1942) is an Irish folk musician, singer-songwriter, and a founding member of popular bands Sweeney's Men, Planxty, Patrick Street, Mozaik, LAPD and Usher's Island. He plays the mandolin, mandola, bouzouki, harmonica and, occasionally, the hurdy-gurdy. Irvine has been influential in folk music for over five decades, during which he recorded a large repertoire of songs and tunes he assembled from books, old recordings and folk-song collectors rooted in the Irish, English, Scottish, Eastern European, Australian and American old-time and folk traditions. He sets these songs to new music and writes songs about his personal experiences or about the lives and struggles of his heroes: Michael Davitt, Mary Harris \"Mother\" Jones, Douglas Mawson, Raoul Wallenberg, Emiliano Zapata, among others. Imbued with a sense of social justice, Irvine often selects or writes songs that are based on historical events and presented from the victim's perspective. Some of these songs chronicle the abject living and working conditions imposed on groups of people: the emigrants; the brutalized migrant workers; the exploited textile strikers or coalminers. Other songs recall the archetypal experiences of single individuals: the woman seduced by an unfaithful man or disowned by her father; the destitute young man ostracized or murdered on the order of his sweetheart\u2019s rich father; the down-on-his-luck farmer or the unemployed worker; the young man inveigled by the army's recruiting sergeant; the scapegoats. Irvine's songs also denounce worker deaths and industrial diseases, and lament the plight of hunted animals. His repertoire includes humorous songs, but also bittersweet ones of unrequited love, or of lovers cruelly separated or dramatically reunited. He also sings about famous racehorses, men or women masquerading in various disguises, a fantastical fox preying on young maidens, and the violent lives of outlaws. As a child actor, Irvine honed his performing talent from an early age and learned the classical guitar. He switched to folk music after discovering Woody Guthrie, also adopting the latter\u2019s other instruments: harmonica and mandolin. While extending Guthrie\u2019s guitar picking technique to the mandolin, he further developed his playing of this instrument\u2014and, later, of the mandola and the bouzouki\u2014into a decorative, harmonic style and embraced the modes and rhythms of Bulgarian folk music. Along with Johnny Moynihan and D\u00F3nal Lunny, Irvine is one of the pioneers who adapted the Greek bouzouki\u2014with a new tuning\u2014into an Irish instrument. He contributed to advancing the design of his instruments in cooperation with English luthier Stefan Sobell, and he also plays a hurdy-gurdy made for him in 1972 by Peter Abnett, another English luthier. Although touring mainly as a soloist, Irvine has also enjoyed great success in pursuing collaborations through many projects that have influenced contemporary folk music, with performers such as Paul Brady,Kevin Burke,Jackie Daly, Dick Gaughan,D\u00F3nal Lunny, Matt Molloy,Christy Moore,Liam O'Flynn, Davy Spillane andBill Whelan, among others. He continues to tour and perform extensively in Ireland, Great Britain, Europe, North and South America, Japan, Australia and New Zealand."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Bridget St John (born Bridget Ann Hobbs; 4 October 1946, Surrey) is an English singer-songwriter, best known for the three albums she recorded between 1969 and 1972 for John Peel's Dandelion record label. Peel produced her debut album Ask Me No Questions. She also recorded a large number of BBC Radio and Peel sessions and toured regularly on the British college and festival circuit. St. John appeared at leading folk venues in the U.K., along with other folk and pop luminaries of the time such as Nick Drake, Paul Simon, and David Bowie, among others. In 1974 she was voted fifth most popular female singer in that year's Melody Maker readers poll. Bridget grew up in a musical household where her mother and sisters were all accomplished pianists. She took piano lessons at her mother's behest, but she didn't get along with her teacher and quit when she was 11. After studying the viola for a while, St. John bought a guitar with 20 pounds her grandmother gave her shortly before she finished high school. Her first performances were at Sheffield University in 1964-5. After a few cameos in between zany sketches by the revue team her very first \"proper gig\" was at a pub in Rotherham. That night she walked back home to Sheffield under the stars and knew she was destined to become a musician and performer. Blessed with a rich, husky vocal style, she is also an accomplished guitar player who credits John Martyn and Michael Chapman as her \"musical brothers\". Her second album Songs for the Gentle Man, was produced by Ron Geesin. This album was a significant step up from her debut, and contained string arrangements by mostly by Geesin himself, particularly striking on the opening track, 'A Day A Way' and 'Seagull- Sunday'. Her third album, released in 1972, 'Thank You For...' was even more ambitious and utilized more musicians with a folk-rock sound. The album was her last album for John Peel's Dandelion label, however, which folded due to its artists' lack of commercial success. She recorded another album, Jumble Queen, for Chrysalis Records in 1974, but by this time her career momentum had stalled. She emigrated to Greenwich Village in 1976 and virtually disappeared from the public eye for over 20 years. She took part in the Strawbs 25th Anniversary festival held in 1993. Bridget released a 'come-back' album in 1996, 'Take The Fifth' and appeared at a Nick Drake tribute concert in New York in 1999. She toured Japan in 2006 with the minimalist French musician Colleen, and appeared with the Electric Strawbs in the B.B. King Blues Club and Grill (NYC) on 27 June 2007. Aside from work under her own name, Bridget St John has also recorded with Mike Oldfield on his albums Ommadawn (1975) and Amarok (1990), as well as Kevin Ayers and Robin Frederick. In 2007 she reunited with Ayers to record \"Baby Come Home\" on his album The Unfairground. She was described by John Peel as \"the best lady singer-songwriter in the country\"."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Jarom\u00EDr Nohavica or Jarek Nohavica (born 7 June 1953 in Ostrava) is a Czech songwriter, lyricist, and poet. He was born in Ostrava and has played guitar since he was 13. He began studying at the Technical University of Ostrava but eventually left the school. He tried various jobs and eventually ended up working as a freelance lyricist. He gained fame with his first song for Marie Rottrov\u00E1, L\u00E1sko, von\u00ED\u0161 de\u0161t\u011Bm (You Smell of Rain, My Love; actually a cover version of the song She's Gone by Black Sabbath). He lives in Ostrava with his wife and two children. In 1982 he started performing in public, and a number of his songs gained wide popularity. His first album, Darmod\u011Bj (The Wastrel), released in 1988, sold out immediately. A mythical aura arose around Nohavica which survived even the crisis period of his treatment for alcoholism. He subsequently released the somewhat pessimistic Mikymauzoleum (Mickey Mausoleum), an album of mainly melancholy songs. In 1994 he recorded a live album, T\u0159i \u010Dun\u00EDci (Three Piglets), intended for children, with humorous songs. In 1996 Nohavica released Divn\u00E9 stolet\u00ED (Strange Century). He and his producer employed new instruments and voices for the new songs on the album, which became a huge success. Two years later the Jaromir Nohavica and Kapela (i.e. the Band) came out with Koncert (Concert), a record featuring Nohavica playing with a band, something which recognizably changed his music. The album contains mainly older material, but the new treatment gave it a new appeal. His studio album from 2000, Moje smutn\u00E9 srdce (My Sad Heart), contained mostly sad songs about love. Nohavica also starred in Petr Zelenka's movie Rok \u010E\u00E1bla (Year of the Devil), which was awarded the main prize at the 37th Karlovy Vary International Film Festival in 2002 and several other international film festivals. He translated the Polish musical Painted on Glass for Divadlo Na Fidlova\u010Dce and poeticized Mozart's opera Cos\u00EC fan tutte for The National Moravian-Silesian Theatre. Apart from his native Czech Republic, he also enjoys popularity in neighbouring Poland and Slovakia. In 2007, Czech singer-songwriter Jaroslav Hutka accused Nohavica of having collaborated with the StB (the Communist-era Czechoslovak secret police). Documents released the previous year indicated that in the 1980s, Nohavica had met in Austria with the noted dissidents Karel Kryl and Pavel Kohout, and had then reported to the police on their activities."@en ;

During his musical career he was signed to Al Khouyoul Records and from 2003 onwards with Rotana Records. In 2011, he declared his allegiance to Salafist sheikh Ahmed al-Assir renouncing music on religious grounds and retiring from his career in music. In June 2013, al-Assir militants attacked the Lebanese Army killing 18 soldiers and wounding 40. Shaker claimed to have killed two soldiers himself. Al-Assir and Shaker later fled and arrest warrants were issued for their capture. During the events, militants went into his villa in Saida, Lebanon and burnt it down. Shaker's whereabouts remain unknown, but media reports confirm he is in hiding in Ain al-Hilweh Palestinian refugee camp. The Lebanese military prosecutor general has signed warrants for his arrest and charged him for a number of crimes including taking part in armed rebellion and in murders. If convicted, he can possibly face life imprisonment or the death penalty. In February 2015, Lebanese media reported that he had retained the legal services of Attorney May El Khansa, who announced that Shaker is considering surrendering himself to the Lebanese authorities for a possible lighter sentence. In March 2015, he announced on LBCI news that he has separated himself from sheikh Al-Assir and that he doesn't have any ties with him anymore. He recanted his previous admission of killing the two soldiers, and he also said that he hopes to return to his normal life. Since then, he has come out of hiding and has returned to his home, but for unbeknownst reasons he still hasn't been arrested. A protest on August 20, 2015 was held in downtown Beirut demanding arrests of the 56 men wanted in relation to the murders of June 2013."@en ;

While growing up in Connecticut, Jerry began his musical studies at the age of 12. He performed in a variety of marching bands, drum corps, jazz bands, brass quintets, classical orchestras, and later earned degrees in Performance and Music Education at the University Of Connecticut. Beginning in the early 1980s, Zigmont \"cut his teeth\" playing club dates and concerts in regional jazz groups throughout New England. In 1987 he began an association with the celebrated British clarinetist, Sammy Rimington which resulted in a series of recordings and tours. Jerry's rousing style has been featured with many noted New Orleans jazz luminaries including Doc Cheatham, Percy Humphrey and Arvell Shaw. Jerry Zigmont is a regular member of Woody Allen and his New Orleans Jazz Band which plays every Monday evening at Manhattan's Carlyle Hotel. His trombone playing is steeped in the classic New Orleans tradition, with its trademark raw power and \"straight from the heart\" approach. He appears on the soundtrack of the documentary film Wild Man Blues (directed by Barbara Kopple) which documents a 1996 European tour by Allen and his band. Zigmont has performed extensively with the group in Europe, South America, Turkey and Greece."@en .

	dbo:abstract	"Cristina Don\u00E0 (Rho, Italy, September 23, 1967) is an Italian singer and songwriter. She developed a passion for music since she was a teenager, her favorite singers being, among others, Bruce Springsteen, Sin\u00E9ad O'Connor, Joni Mitchell, Michelle Shocked, Tom Waits, Lucio Battisti, and Beatles.She studied at Accademia di Belle Arti di Brera in Milano, where, during a student protest in 1990, she met Manuel Agnelli, leader of the Italian indie rock band Afterhours. Later she started her own singer career opening Afterhours\u2019 concerts in their During Christine\u2019s Sleep tour. Besides the live performances in clubs in Milano and surroundings, Don\u00E0, encouraged by Manuel Agnelli himself, began working on her own songs, and released her first album, Tregua, in 1997. The album was an immediate success. Robert Wyatt included it among his favorites of the year in Mojo. The music critic Charlie Gillett broadcast some songs on BBC radio. In the meanwhile Don\u00E0 performed live in an Italian tour, and opened concerts for Ben Harper and David Byrne. In 1999 she dueted with the songwriter Eric Wood in his album Illustrated night, and started working on the second album, Nido. Robert Wyatt contributed to this album with the arrangements in the song Goccia and with the participation to a videoclip, shot on the East Coast of England, and released on the Goccia EP.In 2001 Don\u00E0 was invited (first and only Italian artist so far) to the Meltdown Festival, where she performed the same night as Anja Garbarek and Mark Eitzel. Davey Ray Moor, attending the concert that night, was very much impressed by Don\u00E0\u2019s performance, and this was the starting point of a long-lasting collaboration between the two artists. While working with him on the third album, in January 2002 Don\u00E0 was invited to participate in the Eurosonic Festival in Groningen (The Netherlands). The third album, Dove sei tu, was released in 2003, and Davey Ray Moor performed as a special guest in some concerts during the promotional tour. Don\u00E0 recorded a cover of Kate Bush\u2019s Wuthering Heights, which was included in the single Invisibile. She also worked, together with Davey Ray Moor, on the translation of the lyrics of Dove sei tu. The self-titled album was released in 2004 and distributed in 33 countries by Rykodisc International. The English press welcomed the album with very good reviews. Mojo gives it four stars, Down Beat compared Don\u00E0 to artists such as Marianne Faithfull and Ute Lemper, Sunday Times included a song in the monthly CD attached to the magazine. At the end of 2004 she started an extensive tour all around Europe, performing in Germany, France, UK, Belgium, The Netherlands, Sweden, and with a special performance at the Polar Spectacle Festival in Norway. The American musician Ken Stringfellow played with her in most of the European concerts.
