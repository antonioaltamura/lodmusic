The album's title (which translates to \"We just want your soul\") is taken from a German book which was released by a Christian publisher in 1984 about the (perceived) propagation of satanism and occultism by rock musicians. This book gained a kind of cult status as a piece of real-life satire among heavy metal fans. The subtitle of the first disc is a reference to Mot\u00F6rhead's successful live album No Sleep 'til Hammersmith and it also puns the heavy metal umlaut, for which Mot\u00F6rhead is a noted example. \"Spr\u00FCche II\" on the EP contains two parts played at the same time, which means that one has to unplug the right speaker, when one wants to hear part 1 (left) and the other way around.

	dbo:abstract	"Elektrenika is the third studio album by Polish singer Reni Jusis. Most of the lyrics and half of compositions were written by Jusis herself. Micha\u0142 Przytu\u0142a is composer of the other half of material. Przytu\u0142a who worked with Jusis on her previous projects as a record engineer gets a producer credit with this album. Elektrenika marked Jusis musical metamorphosis. While her two previous albums were heavily influenced by R&B and Hip-Hop music, Elektrenika was an 80's inspired, electronic record with mostly house and club rhythms. It was her first attempt at a dance music scene. \"Electrenic Night Tour\" helped Jusis to promote the album and herself as a dance artist. The album spawned two hits Nic o mnie nie wiecie and \"Nigdy Ciebie Nie Zapomn\u0119\" (\"Jakby Przez Sen\") which is now known as a Polish club classic. In 2001 Elektrenika was nominated to Fryderyk Award in Album of the Year Techno/Elektronic/Dance category."@en ;

These three concerts became the highest grossing concerts at a single venue in history. A double album compiled from these three shows went straight to No. 1 in the UK and stayed there for a total of two weeks, selling about over 120,000 copies. Of the eight studio albums by the Red Hot Chili Peppers that were released prior to Live in Hyde Park, only three are actually represented in this album's set list - Blood Sugar Sex Magik, Californication and By the Way (the single \"Fortune Faded\", however, was featured solely on the band's Greatest Hits compilation). \"Under the Bridge\" and \"Give It Away\" were the only songs from Blood Sugar Sex Magik. The songs \"Leverage of Space\" and \"Rolling Sly Stone\" are exclusive to this collection. There are 4 songs that were also performed but are not included on this release, \"I Like Dirt\" and \"My Lovely Man\" were both performed on June 19, \"Maybe\" (The Chantels cover) on June 20 and \"Mini-Epic (Kill for Your Country)\" on June 25, this last one was originally planned for this release, but did not make it into the CD versions, probably[citation needed] due to delicate issues concerning the theme of the song. However, it was eventually officially released for the first time in 2015 on the Cardiff, Wales: 6/23/04 free live album download. This album is now out of print, but turns up second-hand regularly[citation needed] due to high sales at the time of its release."@en ;

dbr:All_the_Right_Wrongs	rdf:type	schema:MusicAlbum ;
	dbo:abstract	"All the Right Wrongs is the debut EP by American singer-songwriter Emily Osment. The extended play album was released on October 26, 2009, by Wind-up Records. Osment began work on the EP in mid-2008, while filming episodes of the Disney Channel series Hannah Montana. Osment worked with writers and producers such as Max Collins and Tony Fagenson, among others. Osment has stated that she feels she is different from most Disney artists because she feels she has \"spunk\", and that it can be seen on her album. The music on All the Right Wrongs mainly incorporates pop-rock characteristics, with emphasis on the bass and drums in the majority of the songs. The album also makes heavy use of auto-tune, and has an indie rock feel to it as well. Osment has stated that Alanis Morissette was one of the biggest influences on the album, and listed Morissette's album, Jagged Little Pill, as a major influence for her music, especially the album's lead single, \"All the Way Up\". The album itself was given a mixed review from critics, who complimented Osment for signing with Wind-up Records, as opposed to Hollywood Records, as much of the Disney Channel artists do. The album was met with less commercial success in the US however, failing to chart in the upper half of the Billboard 200 album's chart. The album's lead single, \"All the Way Up\", was released on August 25, 2009. It was met with mixed reviews from critics, and was successful in Australia and managed peaking in the Canadian Hot 100 chart at number 77. The single garnered success in the Australian Top Hitseekers Chart, where it peaked at number ten becoming Osment's first top ten hit in Australia. The follow-up single, \"You Are the Only One\", was released to Radio Disney on February 27 the following year. Two more singles were released to Radio Disney as well, including \"Average Girl\", which was released on March 12, 2010, and \"What About Me\", released a day later on March 13, 2010. The album was mainly promoted through live performances, most notably during Osment's extensive touring, which included her own tours, \"Emily Osment's Halloween Bash\", as well as her \"Clap Your Hands\" tour."@en ;

Odd Blood peaked at number 63 on the U.S. Billboard 200 and at number 64 on the UK Albums Chart. It reached number five on the U.S. Billboard Independent Albums chart. Yeasayer followed the record's release with an extended tour throughout 2010. Odd Blood was mostly crafted with engineer Steve Revitte in a secluded cabin studio. During the sessions, Yeasayer experimented with different types of instruments and recording machines. Auxiliary musicians were hired to help with the process. The idea was to marry sonic experimentation with pop structures, while primary songwriters Chris Keating and Anand Wilder explored a variety of themes such as boxing, addiction, and paranoia. Odd Blood also contains several love songs. The album received largely positive reviews from critics. Praise centered on its cohesive merging of genres, especially the pop-influenced rhythms."@en ;

However, she felt dissatisfied with the labels' representatives and consequently, she ended the contract with the labels in July 2014 and signed to Prospect Park. After being delayed for over two years, Broke with Expensive Taste was released on November 7, 2014 by Banks herself and Prospect Park via Caroline Records without any prior announcements. Broke with Expensive Taste was described as a house rap and dance-pop record which incorporates elements from a wide range of genres, including punk, trance, trap, R&B and UK garage. The album received mostly positive reviews from music critics, who praised Banks' musical diversity and opined that the album was \"worth the wait.\" The record spawned four singles: \"Yung Rapunxel\", \"Heavy Metal and Reflective\", \"Chasing Time\", and \"Ice Princess\".

One of Mando Diao\u2019s roadies knew the hip hop producing brothers and introduced Gustaf Nor\u00E9n to them. Nor\u00E9n says he originally approached The Salazar Brothers as he is a massive Latin Kings fan and wanted to get an autograph, but the visit ended with a recorded song. After sitting on the song for a while he played it for the other members of the band and they decided to record more tracks with Salle & Masse.[citation needed] Bj\u00F6rn Dixg\u00E5rd says that the band has been inspired by movies and television with this album and cites Quentin Tarantino and Twin Peaks. He also says that the producers' record collection has been a source of inspiration as well.[citation needed] This album is a danceable album with a strong focus on drums, bass and percussion. The final mix of the album was done in Los Angeles. It reached number one on the Swiss, the Austrian and the German album charts, while reaching number 2 in Sweden, only beaten by Bruce Springsteen's Working on a Dream. The band played a special version of the album's first single entitled \"Fight with Somebody\" live at the Veltins Arena in Gelsenkirchen for Vladimir Klitschko's fight versus Ruslan Chagaev on June 20, 2009. Ahead of its UK release on November 6, 2009, Give Me Fire! was available in full on the UK music site ClashMusic.com alongside a photo gallery of the band on tour.

	dbo:abstract	"D.E. 7th is a 1982 album by Welsh rock musician Dave Edmunds. The album was Edmunds' first project for Arista Records (in the UK) and Columbia Records (in the US), following a five-year stay with the Swan Song label. Besides the label switches, D.E. 7th marked another big change for Edmunds; his band Rockpile had broken up the previous year, forcing him to assemble a whole new group of musicians for the album. The new band coalesced around guitarist Mickey Gee and bassist John David (both of whom had played with Edmunds in Love Sculpture), veteran pub rock pianist Geraint Watkins, and drummer Dave Charles. This group would record and tour with Edmunds throughout the rest of the 1980s. D.E. 7th would reach #60 on the UK album charts and #46 on the Billboard 200, becoming his highest-charting solo album ever in the United States. The album's sales were helped by the inclusion of a previously unreleased Bruce Springsteen song, \"From Small Things (Big Things One Day Come)\" (Springsteen's version, an outtake from his 1980 album The River, would remain unreleased until 2003). In his 2005 book The Ties That Bind, author Gary Graff explains: When (Edmunds) went to see Springsteen perform at Wembley Arena (in 1981), he expected a good show but not necessarily a new song to record. \"I was backstage in the hospitality area after the gig,\" Edmunds remembered, \"and one of his crew of road managers tapped me on the shoulder and said, 'Bruce wants to meet you.' I went back and had this great talk with him, and he played me this song and said, 'I'd like you to do this, if you like it.' He said he'd send me the tape, which he did.\" Edmunds' recording of \"From Small Things\" reached #28 on Billboard's Mainstream Rock Tracks chart, and later appeared on his 2004 \"best of\" collection (also entitled From Small Things). One other D.E. 7th track was selected for that collection: a cover of Brian Hyland's 1962 top-30 hit \"Warmed Over Kisses (Left Over Love)\". Edmunds transformed the song, originally a countrypolitan waltz, into an uptempo bluegrass romp. Edmunds told the New Musical Express at the time that he had happened across pianist Liam Grundy playing in a bar quite by chance and upon hearing the heartfelt ballad 'One more night' invited Grundy to the studio a couple of days later to record it."@en ;

Frusciante said of this album and its follow-up, PBX Funicular Intaglio Zone, \"I consider my music to be Progressive Synth Pop, which says nothing about what it sounds like, but does describe my basic approach. I combine aspects of many styles of music and create my own musical forms by way of electronic instruments. The tracks on Letur-Lefr were recorded in 2010 and PBX was recorded in 2011. Letur is a compilation, a selected portion of music I made that year while PBX was conceived as an album, the songs having been recorded in succession.

None of the three released singles managed to enter any of the Top 100 charts. Warner Bros. Entertainment never pushed the album[citation needed]. In 1983, Jones moved to Minneapolis to begin work on her solo album. Prince spent three years working with his \"prot\u00E9g\u00E9\". Prince wrote and performed much of the music on the album while Jones supplied the lyrics. David Z. did a large portion of the audio engineering and music production (without Prince) at Electric Lady Studios in New York. In addition, Billy Idol guitarist Steve Stevens (a close friend of Jones'), contributed to three tracks on the album. However, only the cover of Prince\u2019s \"With You\" made the album.

The concept of this album is not about a Dutch urban legend or ghost stories, like the previous two albums, but it deals with war. The album contains references to World Wars I and II, as well as the Vietnam War. The first track is a tape recording of a soldier who was ordered to shoot seven prisoners of war, and each shot can be heard. The soldier explains the strange and wicked sensations he felt as he shot each of the prisoners; they were grinning happily as he tried to kill them, and it seemed like the shots went through them, but they were actually demons who captured the soldier's soul in a time loop, making him suffer for eternity. Many of the songs in this album describe the deeds of each of the seven fiends; death, war, suffering. From battalions of ghosts to doctors who ate people, and a little boy that foresaw death at his house, this album is wrapped in the horrible history of war."@en ;

Cult Leader created Nothing for Us Here in about a week and were planning on self releasing it. After sending a copy to their friend Jacob Bannon of Converge to see what he thought of it, Bannon suggested releasing the EP through his own label, Deathwish. The title of the EP has a few different meanings for Cult Leader. Vocalist Anthony Lucero said one meaning is about the end of his previous band Gaza and how \"everything we worked for was just falling apart,\" and it's also a reference to \"the breath of the death: the moment when there's no more life left in you and you have to face oblivion.\" Lucero also created the album's artwork. Nothing for Us Here received generally positive reviews upon release. Jason Schreurs of Exclaim! have the EP an eight-out-of-ten score, and concluded his review stating: \"Not nearly the frenetic headache that Gaza [a now defunct band featuring three members of Cult Leader] was, Cult Leader have found that sweet spot between early Napalm Death and later Converge. It's more punk/core than it is metal, but Nothing for Us Here should please anyone who wakes up in the morning hunting for a dizzying migraine.\" Dean Brown of PopMatters gave the album seven-out-of-ten stars, and concluded his review stating: \"It is a mouth-whetting taster of what we could expect from a Cult Leader full-length album, if the band continues to make more music together. Let's just pray to the vacuous black hole in the sky that this band does make more music as violent and intelligently formed as that found on its first EP, Nothing for Us Here.\""@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"16/9 is the 2004 studio album by the French R&B singer N\u00E2diya. The album and singles off it were a huge success and very popular in France and Switzerland. The album remained for over 90 weeks on the French album chart, which is a remarkable achievement for an album. The album peaked at number six in its thirty-third week. After a year and seven months, the album was certified platinum by SNEP, the French certifier, which means it has sold over 300,000 copies in France, as the official sites notes that over 500,000 copies were sold of the album. The possibility of this being true is very large, as SNEP doesn't certify 500,000 copies to a name, only certifying 600,000 copies to 2x platinum. Worldwide, the album has sold over 750,000 copies. It won the Victoires de la musique award for best rap/hip-hop/R&B album of the year."@en ;

Prior to the release of the album, there was debate about whether the album would be better than the debut album of Son Volt, the new band of former Uncle Tupelo lead singer Jay Farrar. Although A.M. was released before Son Volt's Trace, critical reviews were modest and initial sales were low. The album was later regarded as a \"failure\" by band members, as Trace became a greater commercial success. It was the band's last album to be recorded in a purely alternative country style, as following the record the band began to expand their sound across multiple genres.

It was produced by Jason Ingram and Rusty Varencamp, the same production team from his previous release, Everything Sad Is Coming Untrue. The lead single released to radio was the album opener, \"Remind Me Who I Am\". An accompanying music video directed by Jason's frequent collaborator Doug McKelvey and Daren Thomas was released in July 0f 2011. The video features various people holding cardboard signs that signify their understanding of themselves and explores the idea of identity and where it is found. The video is viewable here. Other songs on the album cover themes ranging from fear, shame, hope, and God's love as the basis for our identity. A series of song diary videos was also produced to promote the project on YouTube and other video outlets featuring \"Good To Be Alive\" and \"Remind Me Who I Am\". Jason was also featured in a series of webisodes produced by Centricity Music that cast their artists in humorous situations with the label's head of A&R John Mays in a fictional school called Centricity U. The webisodes were part of a promotional campaign for the artist's and projects of Centricity Music and were written and directed by Doug McKelvey. The episode featuring Jason and the lead single from A Way To See in the Dark can be seen here. A limited, special edition of the album was also released in a commemorative hard cover-style book that includes eight additional tracks of demos, alternate versions, and new songs as well as a 32-page booklet with Jason's reflections about the meaning behind each of the songs.

	dbo:abstract	"Aretha Franklin Sings the Great Diva Classics is the 38th studio album by American recording artist Aretha Franklin and was released on October 17, 2014. It features ten covers of songs made famous by female recording artists. This is Aretha's first recording for RCA Records and her first studio album to be released under a major label in 11 years - since the release of her 2003 studio album, So Damn Happy. It's also her first album since 1998 to be executive produced by Clive Davis, her boss at Arista Records, which has since folded into RCA. Davis called the album \"purely and simply sensational\" and said of Aretha Franklin, \"She's on fire and vocally in absolutely peak form. What a thrill to see this peerless artist still showing the way, still sending shivers up your spine, still demonstrating that all contemporary music needs right now is the voice. What a voice.\" Production on the album includes R&B producers Kenny \"Babyface\" Edmonds and Harvey Mason, Jr., hip-hop musician Andr\u00E9 3000, and house producers Terry Hunter and Eric Kupper among others. The first single released from the album is a cover of singer Adele's \"Rolling in the Deep\", subtitled as \"The Aretha Version\", which also includes an interpolation of the Marvin Gaye and Tammi Terrell hit, \"Ain't No Mountain High Enough\". The single debuted at number 47 on the Billboard Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart. Aretha Franklin thus becomes the first female, and fourth artist overall (following Lil Wayne, Jay Z and James Brown), to place 100 songs the chart (with her first entry on the chart being \"Today I Sing the Blues\" in 1960)."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Artpop (stylized as ARTPOP) is the third studio album by American singer Lady Gaga. It was released on November 6, 2013, by Streamline and Interscope Records. She began planning the project in 2011, shortly after the launch of her second studio album, Born This Way. Work continued into 2012 and 2013, during which time Gaga was travelling for her headlining Born This Way Ball and recovering from surgery for an injury that she sustained while touring. Gaga described Artpop as \"a celebration and a poetic musical journey\" and an exploration of the \"reverse Warholian\" phenomenon in pop culture. It displays an intentional \"lack of maturity and responsibility\" by comparison to the darker and anthemic nature of Born This Way. Assuming an integral position in its production, she enlisted longtime collaborators including Paul \"DJ White Shadow\" Blair and RedOne and newer partners Zedd and Madeon to achieve Gaga's desired sound. The lyrical themes revolve around her personal views of fame, love, sex, feminism, self-empowerment, overcoming addiction, and reactions to media scrutiny; references include Greek and Roman mythology, and classic jazz and electronic musician Sun Ra. Artpop also features guest vocals from several new partners: T.I., Too Short, Twista, and R. Kelly. The release of Artpop was prefaced by a two-day album release party dubbed an \"ArtRave\". It received generally mixed reviews from music critics, and was commercially successful, debuting at number one on the U.S. Billboard 200 with first-week sales of 258,000 copies, becoming Gaga's second consecutive number-one record in the United States and selling 746,000 copies. It also topped national record charts in five additional countries, and charted within the top ten in over twenty. Artpop was the ninth best seller album of 2013 with 2.3 million copies worldwide. It was included in several year-end lists by music critics and publications. \"Applause\" was serviced as the lead single from Artpop on August 12, 2013, and was a critical and commercial success, charting within the top ten of more than twenty countries worldwide, peaking at number four on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100. The second single \"Do What U Want\" was released on October 21, and peaked at number 13 in the United States. It was followed by promotional singles \"Venus\" and \"Dope\" shortly before the album's release. The album later produced the single \"G.U.Y.\". Gaga promoted Artpop with several television appearances and performances, including her second Thanksgiving Day special, Lady Gaga and the Muppets' Holiday Spectacular. Later, Gaga embarked on the ArtRave: The Artpop Ball tour in support of the album's release."@en ;

dbr:At_Folsom_Prison	rdf:type	schema:MusicAlbum ;
	dbo:abstract	"At Folsom Prison is a live album and 27th overall album by Johnny Cash, released on Columbia Records in May 1968. After his 1955 song \"Folsom Prison Blues\", Cash had been interested in recording a performance at a prison. His idea was put on hold until 1967, when personnel changes at Columbia Records put Bob Johnston in charge of producing Cash's material. Cash had recently controlled his drug abuse problems, and was looking to turn his career around after several years of limited commercial success. Backed with June Carter, Carl Perkins and the Tennessee Three, Cash performed two shows at Folsom State Prison in California on January 13, 1968. The resulting album consisted of fifteen tracks from the first show and two tracks from the second. Despite little initial investment by Columbia, the album was a hit in the United States, reaching number one on the country charts and the top 15 of the national album chart. The lead single from the album, a live version of \"Folsom Prison Blues\", was a top 40 hit, Cash's first since 1964's \"Understand Your Man\". At Folsom Prison received good reviews upon its release and the ensuing popularity revitalized Cash's career, leading to the release of a second prison album, At San Quentin. The album was re-released with additional tracks in 1999 and as a three-disc set in 2008. It was certified three times Platinum on March 27, 2003 by the Recording Industry Association of America for US sales exceeding three million."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Blood on the Dance Floor: HIStory in the Mix is a remix album by American recording artist Michael Jackson. It was released on May 20, 1997 by Epic Records and is the second album released by Jackson's own record label, MJJ Productions. The album is made up of eight remixes from Jackson's previous studio album HIStory, and five new songs. Jackson was heavily involved with the production of the new material while the remixes were produced by other artists. The new material dealt with themes such as drug addiction, sex and relationships, and paranoia. The album, like HIStory, featured Michael playing several instruments. The album received minimal promotion by Jackson's standards, particularly in the United States. Still, a film, two singles (\"Blood on the Dance Floor\" and \"HIStory/Ghosts\") and three music videos were issued as promotion. Reviews at the time of release were largely mixed, some critics felt that Jackson had already explored these musical themes while others criticized what they perceived as weak vocals. Other critics were favorable, with praise issued for similarities to the music of Marilyn Manson and Trent Reznor. Since its debut, the album has sold an estimated ten million copies worldwide, making it the best selling remix album ever released. Several contemporary critics[who?] view the material in an increasingly favorable light and believe the album could have been more successful\u2014commentators argue that certain sections of the world took interest in tabloid stories about the singer's personal life over his musical career.[citation needed]"@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Clam Dip & Other Delights is the 1989 grab-bag EP from Minneapolis rockers Soul Asylum. The title and cover art are both parodies of Herb Alpert and the Tijuana Brass's album Whipped Cream and Other Delights. It was a humorous nod to their new record label, A&M (the \"A\" standing for \"Alpert\"). Bassist Karl Mueller sat in for the original album's model, Dolores Erickson. Dave Ayers, the band's first manager, said that Mueller had to sit for hours in a foul-smelling combination of sour cream, paint, whipped cream and seafood. Also, the album makes fun of the A&M logo being under the title of the album, incorporating the Twin/Tone Records logo instead. The EP originally was released in Britain featuring three covers: Foreigner's \"Juke Box Hero,\" Janis Joplin's \"Move Over\" and \"Chains,\" by an obscure Minneapolis group called the Wad. Only \"Chains\" was included on the American release. The song \"P-9\" was written to benefit striking Hormel workers in Austin, Minnesota. The album is currently in print on Rykodisc Records."@en ;

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cliff_\u0027Em_All>	rdf:type	schema:MusicAlbum ;
	dbo:abstract	"Cliff 'Em All is a compilation of video footage by the American thrash metal band Metallica. It was released in 1987 as a tribute to Metallica's bassist Cliff Burton, who died in a tour bus accident on September 27, 1986, at the age of 24, near Ljungby, Sweden during the European leg of their Damage, Inc. Tour. Its title is derived from Metallica's debut album, Kill 'Em All. The home video also features a performance with former guitarist Dave Mustaine on March 19, 1983, shortly before his ousting from the band for heavy drug and alcohol abuse. The video is a retrospective on the 3 and a half years that Cliff Burton was in Metallica, presented as a collection of bootleg footage shot by fans, some professional filming and TV shots that were never used and some of his best bass solos, personal photos and live concerts. Photos and narrations by the band (Ulrich, Hetfield and Hammett drinking beer) are placed between songs which focus on Burton before fading into a title card of a performance. The video ends with the melodic interlude of \"Orion\" as pictures of Burton are shown. With this video, the band tries to show the unique personality and style he had. While ostensibly the film focuses on Burton, it also has given fans a rare glimpse of Metallica's less-documented early career. This contrasts sharply with the 'Metallica business' represented in the feature film Some Kind of Monster. The back of the case reads \"Well, we finally went and did what we always talked about not doing. Releasing a vid[eo]! Before you throw up in disgust, let us (except K.) tell you the idea behind this.\" The \"K\" is presumably short for Kirk, explaining why he is on the bottom of the cover."@en ;

It is their only album to feature Trevor Horn in the band's line-up as lead vocalist, following the the departure of Jon Anderson and Rick Wakeman in March 1980 after unsuccessful recording sessions in Paris and London for a new album. Horn was joined by Geoffrey Downes, his partner in the new wave band The Buggles. Drama was recorded in a short amount of time as a tour was already booked prior to the change in personnel. It marked a departure in the band's musical direction with songs more accessible and aggressive that featured the use of modern keyboards and a vocoder. Drama was released to a mostly positive critical reception, with most welcoming the band's new sound. The album peaked at No. 2 in the UK and No. 18 in the US, their lowest charting album there since 1971 which fell short of reaching Gold certification by the RIAA. \"Into the Lens\" was released as the album's sole single. Yes toured the album with a 1980 tour of North America and the UK, and were met with some negative reactions during the latter leg over the new line-up change. They disbanded at its conclusion; Horn ventured into producing, Howe and Downes co-formed Asia, and Squire and White formed Cinema with Trevor Rabin which led to a reformed Yes in 1983.

The David of the title is Jurado's friend and former bandmate in Coolidge, David Bazan, who is most famously Pedro the Lion's frontman. In tone, Ghost of David is bleak, spare, and depressing. Most of its thirteen songs concern or tell tragic stories of deception and death. For example, \"Medication,\" the album's opener, is a first-person tale: the narrator, under the strain of having an adulterous affair with a police officer's wife as well as caring for his mentally unbalanced brother, prays for his brother's death. \"December\" laments a man who froze to death in his car. \"Paxil,\" as its title suggests (referring to an anti-depressant drug), mentions medicating \"a heart that doesn't work.\" The title track came from a dream Jurado had that his friend David Bazan had died, and the words he would have said to comfort his widow."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Jack Johnson, later reissued as A Tribute to Jack Johnson, is a soundtrack recorded by American jazz musician Miles Davis. The album was the second film score Davis had composed, after Ascenseur pour l'\u00E9chafaud in 1957. In 1970, Davis was asked by Bill Cayton to record music for his documentary of the same name on the life of boxer Jack Johnson. Johnson's saga resonated personally with Davis, who wrote in the album's liner notes of Johnson's mastery as a boxer, his affinity for fast cars, jazz, clothes, and beautiful women, his unreconstructed blackness, and his threatening image to white men. Jack Johnson was a turning point in Davis' career and has since been viewed as one of his greatest works. Davis, who wanted to put together what he called \"the greatest rock and roll band you have ever heard,\" recorded with a line-up featuring guitarists John McLaughlin and Sonny Sharrock, keyboardists Herbie Hancock and Chick Corea, clarinetist Bennie Maupin, and drummers Jack DeJohnette and Billy Cobham. The album's two tracks were drawn from one recording session on April 7 and edited together with recordings from February 1970 by producer Teo Macero. The music reflected Davis' interest in the eclectic jazz fusion of the time, but also foreshadowed the hard-edged funk that would fascinate him in the next few years."@en ;

It was released after The Jackson 5 broke their contract with Motown; Michael and his brothers had already released the album The Jacksons when Joyful Jukebox Music landed in the bins. Before this break, the Jackson 5 were working hard, dozens of songs per album; Motown gathered some that had been recorded around the years 1972\u20131975, for recording sessions and albums: Skywriter, Get It Together, Dancing Machine and Moving Violation. Those years were very prolific for the Jackson brothers, since in addition to the aforementioned two albums and tracks, Jermaine, Michael and Jackie each had a solo album at that time (respectively Come Into My Life, Music & Me, Jackie Jackson and Forever, Michael), Tito also recorded instrumental solos. The albums Joyful Jukebox Music and Boogie were distributed for a very short period, and the album is one of the rarest albums of the Jackson 5, though not as scarce as Boogie. In 2004, it was available for a limited time from Hip-O Select, to complement Motown's 2001 \"2 Albums on 1 CD\" re-issue set of the Jackson 5's albums, on which some of these songs were issued as bonus tracks.

The album is considered a return to Shihad's earlier heavier style, after an ill-fated attempt to make it big in the United States. The lyrics themselves are notably darker because of this - and are far more politically orientated than their earlier material, following their experiences touring the U.S under the Bush administration. The album entered the New Zealand music charts at number two, going Gold in its first week of release - and then Platinum two weeks later.

dbr:Mad_Not_Mad	rdf:type	schema:MusicAlbum ;
	dbo:abstract	"Mad Not Mad is the sixth studio album by the British ska/pop band Madness. It was originally released in late 1985, and was their first official release on their own label Zarjazz, which was a sub-label of Virgin Records. The album was recorded over a period of two months in 1985, at Westside Studios in London, and at Air studios also in London. The album is generally regarded as the culmination of the smoother, more adult-oriented sound of the band's later work. It features three prolific guest backing vocalists, including the female duo Afrodiziak (composed of Caron Wheeler and Claudia Fontaine), and Jimmy Helms. The album is notably the band's only album not to feature their keyboardist and founding member Mike Barson, who had left the group the previous year to spend more time with his now ex-wife Sandra in Amsterdam, Netherlands. Barson's keyboard parts were filled by synthesizers and Steve Nieve joined the band to take his place. Two years after the album Madness disbanded, but Barson did join them for the recording of their one-off single, \"(Waiting For) The Ghost Train\". The album was their last recording of original material until they officially reformed in 1992. The album peaked at number 16 in the UK charts, and achieved silver status from the BPI. However, the album remains the band's poorest selling studio album to date. It featured the songs \"Yesterday's Men\", \"Uncle Sam\", and \"Sweetest Girl\" which were all released as singles, with corresponding music videos. The three singles that were released all reached the top 40 in the UK charts, however the latter two failed to make the top 20, which was a first for any Madness single. The aforementioned \"Sweetest Girl\" was a cover version of a song by the British post-punk/new wave band Scritti Politti. On release, the album was received favourably by the majority of music critics, although opinions have become much more negative in subsequent decades. And after only a few weeks of its initial release, the writers of NME listed this album at number 55 on their list of the \"100 Best Albums of All Time\". The band themselves have been quite vocal in that they were less satisfied with the album. In a BBC Radio 1 interview in 1993 their lead vocalist, Suggs described Mad Not Mad as \"a polished turd\" (referring to its distinctively glossy mid 1980s over-production by Clive Langer and Alan Winstanley, whom had both produced all of Madness' work since their debut). However, NME are still favourable for the album, including it in their 2015 list of \"50 Albums Released in 1985 That Still Sound Great Today\". The album was re-released in the United Kingdom, in October 2010 on Virgin featuring rare bonus content. The reissue was a 3-disc set which comprises a 14-track with the original album digitally remastered from the original 1/2\" mix tapes; alongside three bonus single remixes and '(Waiting For) The Ghost Train'; a Bonus 10-track CD including demos of all the album's singles and their respective B-sides; plus a Bonus DVD containing all the music videos for the singles as well as live performances from five BBC TV shows. It also features liner notes written by comedian and Madness fan, Phill Jupitus."@en ;

It has confessional lyrics by Badu, which cover themes of insecurity, social issues and personal relationships. The album has been viewed by critics as a female companion to neo soul artist D'Angelo's second album Voodoo (2000), which features a similar musical style and direction. Critics have also noted that while Baduizm contained its share of cryptic lyricism, Mama's Gun is much more direct in its approach, and places the artist in a subjective position more than its predecessor. The album contains the single \"Bag Lady\", a top 10 Billboard hit, nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Female R&B Vocal Performance and for Best R&B Song. The song \"Didn't Cha Know?\" was also nominated for Best R&B Song. The album features substantial contributions from several members of the Soulquarians outfit, of which Badu was a member. It also features guests such as soul singer Betty Wright and trumpeter Roy Hargrove. Mama's Gun was met with great critical success and sold strongly, reaching Platinum two months after its release.

The album was available for preview at MuchMusic's website before the release.[citation needed] The last song on the album, titled \"Masterpiece Theatre III\", is a collage of all the songs on the album including its five singles. The album is a slight departure from Fix Me, containing more theatrical elements and instruments while still retaining the punk rock influence of its predecessor. Songs like Masterpiece Theater 1, 2, and 3, Beside You, and Good To You show some experimentation using pianos and strings and harmonies. The album sold 5,000 copies in its first week of release debuting at No. 4 on the Canadian Albums Chart and since then it has reached Platinum status in Canada with sales of over 80,000 copies nationwide."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Meteora is the second studio album by American rock band Linkin Park. It was released on March 25, 2003 through Warner Bros. Records, following Reanimation, a collaboration album which featured remixes of songs included on their debut studio album Hybrid Theory. The album was produced by the band alongside Don Gilmore. The title Meteora is taken from the Greek Orthodox monasteries sharing the same name.[citation needed] The album has a similar sound to Hybrid Theory, as described by critics. Featuring lots of spray-painted artworks, the album took a year to be recorded. The main artwork was assembled by the band with help of \"The Flem\" and \"Delta\". The album was recorded during touring to support their debut effort and later recorded at NRG studios. Linkin Park released singles from Meteora for over a year, including \"Somewhere I Belong\", \"Faint\", \"Numb\", \"From the Inside\" and \"Breaking the Habit\". The song \"Lying from You\" was released as a promotional single. Meteora is the most successful album in the history of the Alternative Songs chart, a chart that specializes in radio play of alternative songs. As of 2013, the album has sold over 20 million copies worldwide, and is certified six times platinum by the RIAA. Meteora was also ranked number 36 on Billboards Top 200 Albums of the Decade. The song \"Session\" was nominated for the 2004 Grammy Award for Best Rock Instrumental Performance, losing to Jeff Beck's \"Plan B\". Some songs from the album were remixed with some of Jay-Z's songs for the EP Collision Course. It is the first Linkin Park studio album to feature Dave Farrell after he rejoined the band in 2000."@en ;

It was recorded and mixed from October to November 1980 at Le Studio located in Morin Heights, Quebec, Canada, and released on February 12, 1981. Moving Pictures became the band's highest-selling album in the United States, peaking at #3 on the Billboard 200, and it remains the band's most commercially successful recording. The album was one of the first to be certified multi-platinum by the RIAA upon establishment of the certification in October 1984, and eventually went quadruple platinum. Building on their previous album, Permanent Waves, Moving Pictures follows a more radio-friendly format and includes several of the band's best-known songs, such as the singles \"Tom Sawyer\" and \"Limelight\", the rock radio standard \"Red Barchetta\", and the instrumental \"YYZ.\" Moving Pictures is one of two Rush albums listed in 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die (2112 is the other). Kerrang! magazine listed the album at #43 among the \"100 Greatest Heavy Metal Albums of All Time\". In 2012, Moving Pictures was listed as the #10 'Your Favorite Prog Rock Albums of All Time' by Rolling Stone. In 2014, readers of Rhythm voted Moving Pictures the greatest drumming album in the history of progressive rock. The album cover art is a visual pun on the title, and a triple entendre. The first meaning is represented by the movers carrying pictures, with the second by the people watching them who are emotionally moved by the pictures. The third meaning is shown on the back cover, where the entire scene is revealed to be a set for a motion picture."@en ;
