	dbo:abstract	"Wesley Williams (born March 31, 1968 in Toronto, Ontario), better known as Maestro and Maestro Fresh-Wes, is a Canadian rapper, record producer, and actor. His pioneering status and outstanding achievements have led to him being referred to as the \"Godfather of Canadian hip hop\". In 1989 he became the first Canadian rapper to have a Top 40 hit, \"Let Your Backbone Slide\". In 1991 he collaborated on the one-off single \"Can't Repress the Cause\", a plea for greater inclusion of hip hop music in the Canadian music scene, with Dance Appeal, a supergroup of Toronto-area musicians that included Devon, Dream Warriors, B-Kool, Michie Mee, Lillian Allen, Eria Fachin, HDV, Dionne, Thando Hyman, Carla Marshall, Messenjah, Jillian Mendez, Lorraine Scott, Lorraine Segato, Self Defense, Leroy Sibbles, Zama and Thyron Lee White. After the success of his 1991 album, The Black Tie Affair, Maestro's career faltered as he attempted to break into the United States market. However, he returned to the Canadian charts in 1998, with the hit singles \"Stick to Your Vision\" and \"416/905 (T.O. Party Anthem)\". In 2000, \"Ever Since\" featured the track \"Bustin Loose\", in which Maestro Fresh Wes teamed up with Kardinal Offishall. In 2005, Maestro covered Lawrence Gowan's song \"A Criminal Mind\" (featuring Infinite); Gowan appears in the video and his vocals are sampled on the track. Gowan also performed the song with Maestro at the Canadian Urban Music Awards in 2006. In 2006 Maestro again made Canadian hip hop history when he and Rochester AKA Juice joined Professor D and The Dope Poet Society on stage in Cannes, France. Together, they become the first Canadian hip hop acts ever to showcase at Midem, the world's largest and most influential annual music industry conference. In 2012, Maestro released his first set of new material in more than seven years with the release of an EP entitled Black Tuxedo. This was followed by an album, Orchestrated Noise in 2013, which features rocker Sam Roberts, opera singer Measha Brueggergosman, rapper Kardinal Offishall, among others. Orchestrated Noise was released under the name Maestro Fresh Wes, reclaiming his original title from the 1980s."@en ;

His musical ventures include Skankin' Pickle for whom he both played the saxophone and sang, The Chinkees, The Bruce Lee Band, and most recently an acoustic solo project under his own name. After his time with Skankin' Pickle he went on to found Asian Man Records, a label which he has run out of his garage in California since 1996 with only help from his parents and friends. Asian Man Records supports mostly ska and punk bands. Park will support any band as long as it is \"anti-racist, anti-sexist, and anti-prejudice\". Park has used Asian Man Records to release his own music, in addition to providing a start for smaller bands to allow them to grow, including Less Than Jake, Alkaline Trio, and The Lawrence Arms. In 1999 he formed the Plea for Peace Foundation an organization whose aim is \"to promote the ideas of peace through the power of music\", something which Park has been trying to do with his own bands and with the help of other groups. Park was the impetus behind the Spring 1998 \"Ska Against Racism\" tour. The goal of the tour was to promote awareness about racism and raise money for anti-racism organisations such as the Museum of Tolerance. The national tour included The Toasters, Less Than Jake, the Blue Meanies, Mustard Plug, Five Iron Frenzy, MU330, Kemuri, and Mike Park himself."@en ;

At the age of 15, Nance was discovered in a discoth\u00E8que by dance-producer Ruud van Rijen. He created the dance-act Twenty 4 Seven, in which Nance performs along with rapper Tony Dawson-Harrison, more commonly known by his stage name, Captain Hollywood. When the latter left the project and was replaced by rapper Stay C the act scored its biggest hits, like Slave to the Music. In 1996 Nance decided to leave Twenty 4 Seven to start up a solo-career, which led to a couple of small hits in The Netherlands. Around the same time she began working as a TV host for several channels. She hosted the Dutch Top 40 a couple of times for TMF Nederland. A little later she did the love quiz Liefde is... for RTL 5. In 1999 she started hosting the game show Rappatongo for Tros. After 200 episodes the show was cancelled. Nance started hosting the game show Lingo which she did until late 2005 when she decided to host programmes for SBS 6.

A multi-instrumentalist, he was known primarily for playing the electric violin and mandolin, as well as the harmonica, keyboards, glockenspiel, and other instruments (sometimes described as \"devices\" on album notes). Nash worked as a solo artist beginning in 1975; founding the progressive rock band FM in 1976. Soon after releasing the band's first album, Black Noise, in 1977, he left the band; he resumed his solo career in 1978 (it was not until after Nash's departure that the album was widely promoted, eventually charting and receiving a gold record award). He rejoined FM from 1983 to 1996, concurrent with his solo work. Nash's music covers an eclectic range, varying from instrumental\u2014mood-setting music, to rock and pop music with vocals. In addition to giving concert performances, he has composed and performed soundtrack music for silent films, presenting these works live in movie theatres to accompany screenings of the films. Another venue for his music is in performances to accompany the viewing of paintings by surrealist painter Robert Vanderhorst, an audiovisual collaboration, which took place in 1978 and again in 2004."@en ;

Since her emergence on the country music scene in late 1986 with her first (self-titled) album, Loveless has been one of the most popular female singers of neotraditional country. She has also recorded albums in the country pop and bluegrass genres. Loveless was born in Pikeville, Kentucky, and raised in Elkhorn City, Kentucky, and Louisville, Kentucky. She rose to stardom thanks to her blend of honky tonk and country-rock and a plaintive, emotional ballad style. Her late-1980s records were generally popular, earning her comparisons to Patsy Cline, but most critics agree that she came into her own as an artist in the early 1990s. To date, more than 40 singles by Loveless have made the Billboard Hot Country Songs charts, including five in the number 1 position. She has recorded 14 studio albums (not counting compilations); in the United States, four of these albums have been certified platinum, and two have been certified gold. She has been a member of the Grand Ole Opry since 1988.Loveless is a first cousin of Loretta Lynn and Crystal Gayle. She was married to Terry Lovelace, from whom she derived her professional name, from 1976 to 1986. She has been married to Emory Gordy Jr., who is also her producer, since 1989."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Paul Lorin Kantner (March 17, 1941 \u2013 January 28, 2016) was an American guitarist, singer and songwriter, known for co-founding Jefferson Airplane, a leading psychedelic rock band of the counterculture era, and its more commercial spin-off band Jefferson Starship. He was born in San Francisco, California. Jefferson Airplane formed in 1965 when Kantner met Marty Balin. Kantner eventually became the leader of the group and led it through its highly successful late 1960s period. In 1970, while still active with Jefferson Airplane, Kantner and several Bay Area musicians recorded a one-off side project under the name \"Paul Kantner and the Jefferson Starship.\" Jefferson Airplane continued to record and perform until 1972. When the band officially broke up, Kantner revived the Jefferson Starship name and continued to record and perform with that band for the next five decades. Kantner had the longest continuous membership with the band; at times he was the only founding member still in the band from the original Jefferson Airplane lineup, and was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame with other band members in 1996."@en ;

Pixinguinha is considered one of the greatest Brazilian composers of popular music, particularly within the genre of music known as choro. By integrating the music of the older choro composers of the 19th century with contemporary jazz-like harmonies, Afro-Brazilian rhythms, and sophisticated arrangements, he introduced choro to a new audience and helped to popularize it as a uniquely Brazilian genre. He was also one of the first Brazilian musicians and composers to take advantage of the new professional opportunities offered to musicians by the new technologies of radio broadcasting and studio recording. Pixinguinha composed dozens of choros, including some of the most well-known works in the genre such as \"Carinhoso\", \"Gl\u00F3ria\", \"Lamento\" and \"Um a Zero\"."@en .

	dbo:abstract	"Little Richard (born Richard Wayne Penniman; December 5, 1932) is an American musician, singer and songwriter. An influential figure in popular music and culture for more than six decades, Little Richard's most celebrated work dates from the mid-1950s, when his dynamic music and charismatic showmanship laid the foundation for rock and roll. His music also played a key role in the formation of other popular music genres, including soul and funk. Little Richard influenced numerous singers and musicians across musical genres from rock to hip hop; his music helped shape rhythm and blues for generations to come, and his performances and headline-making thrust his career right into the mix of American popular music. Little Richard has been honored by many institutions. He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as part of its first group of inductees in 1986. He was also inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame. He is the recipient of a Lifetime Achievement Award from the Recording Academy and a Lifetime Achievement Award from the Rhythm and Blues Foundation. Little Richard's \"Tutti Frutti\" (1955) was included in the National Recording Registry of the Library of Congress in 2010, which stated that his \"unique vocalizing over the irresistible beat announced a new era in music.\" In 2015, the National Museum of African American Music  honored Little Richard with a Rhapsody & Rhythm Award for his pivotal role in the formation of popular music genres and in helping to shatter the color line on the music charts, changing American culture significantly."@en ;

Brought up unconventionally by his grandmother after his father Peter McLaren left the family home, McLaren attended a number of British art colleges and adopted the stance of the social rebel in the style of French revolutionaries the Situationists. With a keen eye for trends, McLaren realised that a new protest style was needed for the '70s, and largely initiated the punk movement, for which he supplied fashions from the Chelsea boutique 'SEX', operated with his girlfriend Vivienne Westwood. After a spell advising the New York Dolls in the US, McLaren managed the Sex Pistols, for which he recruited the nihilistic frontman Johnny Rotten. The issue of a controversial record, \"God Save the Queen\", satirising the Queen's Jubilee in 1977 was typical of McLaren's shock tactics, and he gained publicity by being arrested after a promotional boat trip outside the Houses of Parliament. McLaren also performed as a solo artist, initially popularising hip hop and world music and later diversifying into funk and disco, the dance fashion for \"vogueing\" and merging opera with contemporary electronic musical forms. When accused of turning popular culture into a cheap marketing gimmick, he joked that he hoped it was true. In his later years, he lived in Paris and New York City, and died of peritoneal mesothelioma in a Swiss hospital."@en ;

Tiersen is often mistaken for a composer of soundtracks, himself saying \"I'm not a composer and I really don't have a classical background\", but his real focus is on touring and studio albums which just happen to often be suitable for film.

In the 1950s, she was one of the most famous proponents of exotica music. Sumac became an international success based on her extreme vocal range, which was said to be \"well over five octaves\" at the peak of her singing career. Sumac recorded an extraordinarily wide vocal range of 5 octaves, 3 notes and a semitone ranging from E2 to B\u266D7 (approximately 107 Hz to 3.7 kHz). In one live recording of \"Chuncho\", she sings a range of over four and a half octaves, from B2 to F\u266F7. She was able to sing notes in the low baritone register as well as notes above the range of an ordinary soprano and notes in the whistle register. Both low and high extremes can be heard in the song Chuncho (The Forest Creatures) (1953). She was also apparently able to sing in an eerie \"double voice\". In 1954, classical composer Virgil Thomson described Sumac's voice as \"very low and warm, very high and birdlike\", noting that her range \"is very close to five octaves, but is in no way inhuman or outlandish in sound\". In 2012, audio recording restoration expert John H. Haley favorably compared S\u00FAmac's tone to opera singers Isabella Colbran, Maria Malibran, and Pauline Viardot. He described S\u00FAmac's voice as not having the \"bright penetrating peal of a true coloratura soprano\", but having in its place \"an alluring sweet darkness...virtually unique in our time\"."@en ;

His stage name Zucchero is the Italian word for sugar, as his elementary teacher used to call him. His music is largely inspired by gospel, soul, blues and rock music, and alternates between Italian ballads and more rhythmic R&B-boogie-like pieces. He is credited as the \"father of the Italian blues\", introducing the blues music on the big stage in Italy. He is one of the few European blues artists who still enjoy great international success. In his career, spanning more than three decades, Fornaciari has sold over 50 million records around the world, and internationally his most successful singles are \"Diamante\", \"Il Volo/My Love\", \"Baila (Sexy Thing)/Baila morena\", and the duet \"Senza una donna (Without a Woman)\" with Paul Young. He has achieved numerous awards, including four Festivalbar, six Wind Music Awards, two World Music Awards (1993, 1996), six IFPI Europe Platinum Awards, and a Grammy Award nomination.

	dbo:abstract	"Sir Arthur Edward Drummond Bliss CH KCVO (2 August 1891 \u2013 27 March 1975) was an English composer and conductor. Bliss's musical training was cut short by the First World War, in which he served with distinction in the army. In the post-war years he quickly became known as an unconventional and modernist composer, but within the decade he began to display a more traditional and romantic side in his music. In the 1920s and 1930s he composed extensively not only for the concert hall, but also for films and ballet. In the Second World War, Bliss returned to England from the US to work for the BBC and became its director of music. After the war he resumed his work as a composer, and was appointed Master of the Queen's Music. In Bliss's later years, his work was respected but was thought old-fashioned, and it was eclipsed by the music of younger colleagues such as William Walton and Benjamin Britten. Since his death, his compositions have been well represented on record, and many of his better-known works remain in the repertoire of British orchestras."@en .

He is the lead vocalist of the hard rock band Guns N' Roses, a position he has held since its inception in 1985. In addition to Guns N' Roses, he is also the current lead singer of AC/DC since 2016. Due to his powerful and wide vocal range and energetic live performances, Rose has been named one of the greatest singers of all time by various media outlets, including Rolling Stone and NME. Born and raised in Lafayette, Indiana, Rose moved to Los Angeles in the early 1980s, where he became active in the local hard rock scene and joined several bands, including Hollywood Rose and L.A. Guns. In 1985, he co-founded Guns N' Roses, with whom he had great success and recognition in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Their first album, Appetite for Destruction (1987), has sold in excess of 30 million copies worldwide, and is the best-selling debut album of all time in the U.S. with 18 million units sold. Its full-length follow-ups, the twin albums Use Your Illusion I and Use Your Illusion II (1991), were also widely successful; they respectively debuted at No. 2 and No. 1 on the Billboard 200 and have sold a combined 35 million copies worldwide. After 1994, following the conclusion of their two-and-a-half-year Use Your Illusion Tour, Rose disappeared from public life for several years, while the band disintegrated due to personal and musical differences. As its sole remaining original member, he was able to continue working under the Guns N' Roses banner because he had legally obtained the band name. In 2001, he resurfaced with a new line-up of Guns N' Roses at Rock in Rio 3, and subsequently played periodic concert tours to promote the long-delayed Chinese Democracy (2008), which undersold the music industry's commercial expectations despite positive reviews upon its release. In 2012, Rose was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of Guns N' Roses, though he declined to attend the event and requested exclusion from the HoF."@en ;

King was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1987, and is considered one of the most influential blues musicians of all time, earning the nickname \"The King of the Blues\", and one of the \"Three Kings of the Blues Guitar\" along with Albert King and Freddie King. King was known for performing tirelessly throughout his musical career, appearing at more than 200 concerts per year on average into his 70s. In 1956, he reportedly appeared at 342 shows. King was born on a cotton plantation in Berclair, Mississippi, and later worked at a cotton gin in Indianola, Mississippi. He was attracted to music and the guitar in church, and began his performance career in juke joints and local radio.

Born and raised in Detroit, she rose to fame as a founding member and lead singer of the vocal group The Supremes, which, during the 1960s, became Motown's most successful act and is to this day America's most successful vocal group as well as one of the world's best-selling girl groups of all time.As part of the Supremes, her success made it possible for future African American R&B and soul acts to find mainstream success. The group released a record setting, twelve number-one hit singles on the Billboard Hot 100 including the hits \"Where Did Our Love Go\", \"Baby Love\", \"Come See About Me\", \"Stop! In the Name of Love\", \"You Can't Hurry Love\", \"You Keep Me Hangin' On\", \"Love Child\" and \"Someday We'll Be Together\". Following her departure from the Supremes in 1970, Ross released her debut solo album, Diana Ross, which contained the hits \"Reach Out and Touch (Somebody's Hand)\" and the number-one hit \"Ain't No Mountain High Enough\". She released the album Touch Me in the Morning in 1973. Its title track reached number 1, becoming her second solo hit. By 1975, the Mahogany soundtrack included her 3rd number-one hit \"Theme from Mahogany (Do You Know Where You're Going To)\". Her 1976 album Diana Ross included her fourth number-one hit \"Love Hangover\". In 1979, Ross released the album The Boss. Her 1980 album Diana reached number 2 on the Billboard albums chart and spawned the number-one hit \"Upside Down\" and the international hit \"I'm Coming Out\". After leaving Motown, Ross achieved her sixth and final number-one hit with the duet \"Endless Love\". Ross also ventured into acting, with a Golden Globe Award and Academy Award nominated performance in Lady Sings the Blues (1972). She also starred in two other feature films, Mahogany (1975) and the The Wiz (1978); later acting included roles in the television films Out of Darkness (1994), for which she also was nominated for a Golden Globe Award, and Double Platinum (1999). Ross was named the \"Female Entertainer of the Century\" by Billboard magazine. In 1993, the Guinness Book of World Records declared Ross the most successful female music artist in history due to her success in the United States and United Kingdom for having more hits than any female artist in the charts with a career total of 70 hit singles with her work with the Supremes and as a solo artist. Ross has sold more than 100 million records worldwide when her releases with the Supremes and as a solo artist are tallied. In 1988, Ross was inducted to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as member of the Supremes alongside Mary Wilson and Florence Ballard. She is the recipient of the Kennedy Center Honors in 2007. She is a 12-time Grammy nominee, never earning a competitive honor, but later becoming the recipient of the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 2012."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"James Joseph \"Jimmy\" Chamberlin (born June 10, 1964) is an American drummer and record producer. He is best known as the drummer for the alternative rock band The Smashing Pumpkins. Following the 2000 breakup of the band, Chamberlin joined Pumpkins frontman Billy Corgan in the supergroup Zwan and also formed his own group, the Jimmy Chamberlin Complex. In 2005, Chamberlin joined Corgan in reforming The Smashing Pumpkins; he eventually left the group in March 2009, though he returned again in 2015 for a summer tour. He performed in the group Skysaw until 2012. He is currently active under the Jimmy Chamberlin Complex name. In addition to his current work as CEO, Chamberlin has joined Chicago jazz saxophonist Frank Catalano for a string of 2013\u201315 performances in the Chicago area. An EP by Catalano and Chamberlin Love Supreme Collective - EP was released on the 29th of July 2014. Chamberlin, who originally trained as a jazz drummer, cites jazz musicians Benny Goodman, Duke Ellington, Gene Krupa, and Buddy Rich, as well as rock drummers Keith Moon, Ian Paice, and John Bonham as major influences on his technique. While he is known as \"one of the most powerful drummers in rock,\" he primarily strives for emotionally communicative playing. In 2008, Gigwise named Chamberlin the 5th best drummer of all time."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"John Graham Mellor (21 August 1952 \u2013 22 December 2002), known by his stage name Joe Strummer, was a British musician, singer, actor and songwriter who was the co-founder, lyricist, rhythm guitarist and lead vocalist of the Clash, a punk rock band that was formed in 1976 as part of the original wave of British punk. Their music also incorporated elements of reggae, ska, dub, funk, rap, and rockabilly. The Clash were one of the most prominent of the emerging bands in the UK punk rock scene, with their second album, Give 'Em Enough Rope (1978) reaching number 2 on the UK charts. Soon after, they began achieving success in the US, starting with London Calling (1979), and peaking with 1982's Combat Rock, reaching number 7 on the US charts and being certified 2\u00D7 platinum there. The Clash's politicised lyrics, musical experimentation, and rebellious attitude had a far-reaching influence on rock, and alternative rock in particular. His musical experience included his membership of the 101ers, Latino Rockabilly War, the Mescaleros and the Pogues, in addition to his own solo music career. Strummer's work as a musician allowed him to explore other interests, which included acting, creating film scores for television and movies, songwriting, radio broadcasting, and a position as a radio host. Strummer is one of the iconic figures of the British punk movement. Strummer and the Clash were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in January 2003. In his remembrance, Strummer's friends and family established the Strummerville Foundation for the promotion of new music."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Linda Maria Ronstadt (born July 15, 1946) is an American popular music singer. She has earned 11 Grammy Awards, three American Music Awards, two Academy of Country Music awards, an Emmy Award, and an ALMA Award, and many of her albums have been certified gold, platinum or multiplatinum in the United states and internationally. She has also earned nominations for a Tony Award and a Golden Globe award. She was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in April 2014. On July 28, 2014, she was awarded the National Medal of Arts and Humanities. In total, she has released over 30 studio albums and 15 compilation or greatest hits albums. Ronstadt charted 38 Billboard Hot 100 singles, with 21 reaching the top 40, 10 in the top 10, three at number 2, and \"You're No Good\" at number 1. This success did not translate to the UK, with only her single \"Blue Bayou\" reaching the UK Top 40. Her duet with Aaron Neville, \"Don't Know Much\", peaked at number 2 in December 1989. In addition, she has charted 36 albums, 10 top-10 albums and three number 1 albums on the Billboard Pop Album Chart. Her autobiography, Simple Dreams: A Musical Memoir, was published in September 2013. It debuted in the Top 10 on the New York Times Best Sellers List. Ronstadt has collaborated with artists in diverse genres, including Bette Midler, Billy Eckstine, Frank Zappa, Rosemary Clooney, Flaco Jim\u00E9nez, Philip Glass, Warren Zevon, Emmylou Harris, Gram Parsons, Dolly Parton, Neil Young, Johnny Cash, and Nelson Riddle. She has lent her voice to over 120 albums and has sold more than 100 million records, making her one of the world's best-selling artists of all time. Christopher Loudon, of Jazz Times, wrote in 2004 that Ronstadt is \"blessed with arguably the most sterling set of pipes of her generation.\" After completing her last live concert in late 2009, Ronstadt retired in 2011. She was diagnosed as having Parkinson's disease in December 2012, which left her unable to sing."@en ;

Gardel's baritone voice and the dramatic phrasing of his lyrics made miniature masterpieces of his hundreds of three-minute tango recordings. Together with lyricist and long-time collaborator Alfredo Le Pera, Gardel wrote several classic tangos. Gardel died in an airplane crash at the height of his career, becoming an archetypal tragic hero mourned throughout Latin America. For many, Gardel embodies the soul of the tango style. He is commonly referred to as \"Carlitos\", \"El Zorzal\" (The [Song] Thrush), \"The King of Tango\", \"El Mago\" (The Wizard), \"El Morocho del Abasto\" (The Brunette boy from Abasto), and ironically \"El Mudo\" (The Mute)."@en ;

His most commercially successful group was Thin Lizzy, of which he was a founding member, the principal songwriter, lead vocalist and bassist. He later also found success as a solo artist. Growing up in Dublin in the 1960s, Lynott fronted several bands as a lead vocalist, most notably Skid Row alongside Gary Moore, before learning the bass guitar and forming Thin Lizzy in 1969. After initial success with \"Whiskey in the Jar\", the band found strong commercial success in the mid-1970s with hits such as \"The Boys Are Back in Town\", \"Jailbreak\" and \"Waiting for an Alibi\", and became a popular live attraction due to the combination of Lynott's vocal and songwriting skills and the use of dual lead guitars. Towards the end of the 1970s, Lynott also embarked upon a solo career, published two books of poetry, and after Thin Lizzy disbanded, he assembled and fronted the band Grand Slam, of which he was the leader until it folded in 1985. He subsequently had major UK success with Moore with the song \"Out in the Fields\", followed by the minor hit \"Nineteen\", before his death on 4 January 1986. He remains a popular figure in the rock world, and in 2005, a statue to his memory was erected in Dublin."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Charles Kent \"Charlie\" Wilson (born January 29, 1953), also known as Uncle Charlie, is an American R&B singer, songwriter, producer and the former lead vocalist for The Gap Band. As a solo artist he has been nominated for eleven Grammy awards and six NAACP Image Awards (including one WIN), received a 2009 Soul Train Icon Award, and was a recipient of a BMI Icon Award in 2005. In 2009, he was named Billboard magazine's No. 1 Adult R&B Artist, and his song \"There Goes My Baby\" was named the No. 1 Urban Adult Song for 2009 in Billboard Magazine. On June 30, 2013, BET honored Wilson with a Lifetime Achievement Award that was presented to him by Justin Timberlake. The BET tribute performances included renditions of Wilson's songs performed by India Arie (\"There Goes My Baby\"), Jamie Foxx (\"Yearning for Your Love\"), and Stevie Wonder (\"Burn Rubber\") but it was not until Wilson himself took to the stage at the request of Timberlake to perform his Grammy-nominated song \"You Are\" and then transition into a medley of hit songs performing alongside Timberlake and surprise guests Snoop Dogg and Pharrell Williams that Wilson stole the show during the youth oriented program. The Charlie Wilson tribute helped BET achieve the highest ratings in years for the program and also earned the network the #1 primetime spot in the 18\u201349 demographic topping all its broadcast and cable competition for the night in both demographics and total viewers. Wilson is the national spokesman for the Prostate Cancer Foundation where there is a Creativity Award in his name which donates hundreds of thousands of dollars a year to researchers across the country for the development of creative science that conforms to PCF funding principles but is short-term and designed to allow development of otherwise unfunded ideas."@en ;
