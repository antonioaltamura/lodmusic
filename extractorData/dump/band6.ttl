Despite limited commercial success, The Birthday Party's influence has been far-reaching, and they have been called \"one of the darkest and most challenging post-punk groups to emerge in the early '80s.\" The group's \"bleak and noisy soundscapes,\" which drew irreverently on blues, free jazz, and rockabilly, provided the setting for vocalist Nick Cave's disturbing tales of violence and perversion. Their music has been described by critic Simon Reynolds as gothic, and their single \"Release the Bats\" was particularly influential on the emerging gothic scene. In 1980, The Birthday Party moved from Melbourne to London, where they were championed by broadcaster John Peel. Disillusioned by their stay in London, the band's sound and live shows became increasingly violent. They broke up soon after relocating to West Berlin in 1983.

The short-lived band was founded in Los Angeles by experimental composer Joseph Byrd and singer and lyricist Dorothy Moskowitz, with musicians Gordon Marron, Rand Forbes and Craig Woodson, but split up shortly after the release of their only album in 1968. Their sound blended a range of musical genres, including avant-garde, psychedelic, and art rock, with many of the songs' lyrics reflecting Byrd's leftist political views. Unusually, the band had no guitar player; instead, they used strings, keyboards and electronics, including primitive synthesizers, and various audio processors, including the ring modulator. According to critic Kevin Holm-Hudson, \"what distinguishes the United States of America from some of its contemporaries... is the seriousness and skill with which they incorporated avant-garde and other influences into their music.\""@en ;

The band's greatest success was in the early 1980s. Though a part of that era's productive punk rock scene, their music was distinctive for its morbid lyricism and often for its sophisticated arrangements, as heard, for example, on 1981's A Minute to Pray, A Second To Die.

	dbo:abstract	"Habana Abierta is a Cuban band. They are a member of a generation of composers, musicians, sculptors, authors, actors, etc. which emerged in the early 90s with its own identity in Havana, even though some of their creations had already been well known for some years in the island's cultural circles. The origins of Habana Abierta go back to a personal project of music duo Gema y P\u00E1vel, who wanted to produce a compilation of everything they and their peers had been doing in Havana clubs with hardly any resources. Initially, Luis Alberto Barber\u00EDa, Pepe del Valle, Carlos Santos, Boris Larramendi, Superavit, Andy Villal\u00F3n, Kelvis Ochoa and Jos\u00E9 Luis Medina, backed by the NUBENEGRA recording label, gave us a first glimpse released under the name Habana Oculta. In July 1996 most of them travelled to Spain (except for Carlos Santos, Ra\u00FAl Ciro and Alejandro Fr\u00F3meta: Super\u00E1vit) to showcase their music at several festivals and clubs, and very soon spurred interest among audiences and the media alike, and even well-known Spanish artists and musicians. Ana Bel\u00E9n and V\u00EDctor Manuel, along with Ketama, were the first to show an interest and to take the initiative in a gradual and rich exchange with our Habana Abierta, which whom they made music in Spain. BMG Ariola asked Gema y P\u00E1vel to come up with a project bringing a group of highly different singer-songwriters together on the album, based on the individuality of each member yet with combined expression of the diverse unity of Cuban music. Then Vanito Brown and Alejandro Guti\u00E9rrez joined what was to become Habana Abierta, recording a new album under this name. They played over 80 gigs throughout Spain in 1997, 50 of them in Madrid and in 1998 recorded am album with the line-up down to 6, as Andy and Barber\u00EDa had left to branch out on their own. With 24 Horas, the second album with Habana Abierta, an eclectic line was followed with some tracks from previous recordings, with a more defined fusion between popular Cuban music and funk, reggae and hip-hop. Rock and Pop Cuban-style with national roots: Van Van by Juan Fromel, Irakere by Chucho Vald\u00E9s or NG la Banda by Jos\u00E9 Luis Cort\u00E9s, refrains attributed to Matamoros over Red Hot Chili Peppers or Rolling Stones riffs. Conga-funk, timba-rock, bolero-hop, chachacha-blues, son and pop.... In January 2003, after six years in Spain, they returned to Cuba for a series of sell-out individual shows, with a performance by the Habana Abierta full line-up at La Tropical, playing to with over 10,000 people. This gave rise to the Habana Abierta documentary directed by Jorge Perugorr\u00EDa and Arturo Soto, which was presented at several film festivals."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"The Scofflaws are a Huntington, Long Island, New York-based third wave ska band that debuted in 1988. Known for their rambunctious live shows, technically proficient horn solos and tight arrangements, The Scofflaws were one of the top third wave ska acts of the '90s and one of the most beloved bands on the now-defunct Moon Ska label, as well as the center and focal point of the once-thriving Long Island ska scene. The band originally performed as The New Bohemians, initially with a stronger emphasis on novelty \u201860s, R&B and television-show theme cover songs, bolstered by original ska-oriented anthems such as \"Rudy's Back\" and \"Paul Getty\". They sold the New Bohemians name to Geffen Records, who had just signed Edie Brickell & New Bohemians, in 1988, and regrouped as The Scofflaws. The Scofflaws early sound was characterized by strong R&B and jazz influences as well as eclectic covers of such songs as Henry Mancini's \"A Shot in the Dark\", Danny Elfman's theme for Pee-wee's Big Adventure, and a scorching live rendition of The Skatalites instrumental \"Ska-La Parisian\". Original songs like \"Ska-La-Carte\", \"Nude Beach\" and \"William Shatner\" became cult favorites due to the offbeat lyrics and quirky vocal stylings of bandleader Richard \"Sammy\" Brooks and trombonist Buford O'Sullivan. They toured the United States several times, including stints as the openers for Desmond Dekker and Bad Manners. In addition, they toured Europe in 1998 supporting Laurel Aitken & The New York Ska Jazz Ensemble. The band's lineup saw frequent changes and served as a springboard for numerous New York ska musicians, as well as sprouting several spinoff groups. Original co-frontman Mike Drance left in 1994 to form The Bluebeats, while bassist Victor Rice went on to be a founding member of The New York Ska-Jazz Ensemble and continue a career in music production. Several Scofflaws members including O'Sullivan, Paul Gebhardt, and Tony Calarco also played for fellow Moon Ska artists The Toasters as well as One Groovy Coconut and Royal Roost, and The Scofflaws have often shared members with Huntington disciples Spider Nick & the Maddogs (whose leader, \"Spider Nick\" Martielli, wrote Scofflaws favorite \"Spider on My Bed\"). Although The Scofflaws have not released a studio recording since 1998, Brooks continues to lead the band in live performances within the New York area."@en ;

dbr:The_Ocean_Blue	rdf:type	dbo:Band ;
	dbo:abstract	"The Ocean Blue, formed in Hershey, Pennsylvania in 1986, is an American indie pop band that combines melodic guitars and synthesizers. Its core original members included David Schelzel (born September 26, 1967) on lead vocals/guitar, Steve Lau on keyboards/saxophone, Bobby Mittan on bass guitar and Rob Minnig on drums and vocals. Its current line-up includes David Schelzel on lead vocals/guitar, Oed Ronne on keyboards/guitar/vocals, Bobby Mittan on bass guitar and Peter Anderson on drums. The band's sound may be best described as jangly guitar-based modern rock. Influences include such bands as The Smiths, Cocteau Twins, R.E.M., Echo & the Bunnymen and New Order. The Ocean Blue's earliest shows always consisted of a healthy dose of covers by these bands. To this day, The Smiths and New Order covers still punctuate concert encores."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"The Walkabouts is an American rock band formed in Seattle in 1984. The core members are vocalist Carla Torgerson and vocalist and songwriter Chris Eckman. Although the rest of the line-up has changed occasionally, for most of the time the other members have been Michael Wells, Glenn Slater and Terri Moeller. The band draws inspiration from folk and country music, particularly Townes Van Zandt, Neil Young and Johnny Cash, but also from other types of artists and musical styles such as Scott Walker, Leonard Cohen, French chanson and Jacques Brel. Their sound is typically rich, with string arrangements and keyboards in addition to the standard rock instruments. In reviews the band's music is often described as melancholic or mellow, while Eckman's lyrics, concerning such themes as human relations, loneliness and restlessness, are often emphasized as poetic. The Walkabouts have achieved commercial success and a strong fanbase in Europe, where they have done promotion and extensive touring since early 1990s. They have occasionally even made it high on the record charts in countries such as Greece and Norway."@en ;

dbr:Titãs	rdf:type	dbo:Band ;
	dbo:abstract	"Tit\u00E3s ([t\u0283i\u02C8t\u0250\u0303s]) are a rock band from S\u00E3o Paulo, Brazil. Though they basically play pop/alternative rock, their music has touched a number of other styles throughout their 30-year career, such as new wave, punk rock, grunge, MPB and electronic music. They are one of the most successful rock bands in Brazil, having sold more than 6.3 million albums and having been covered by several well-known Brazilian artists and a couple of international singers. They were awarded a Latin Grammy in 2009 and have won the Imprensa Trophy for Best Band a record four times. Tit\u00E3s started with a rather unusual line-up of nine members (including six lead vocalists): Nando Reis (bass guitar, vocals), Branco Mello (vocals), Marcelo Fromer (Rhythm guitar), Arnaldo Antunes (vocals), Tony Bellotto (Lead guitar), Paulo Miklos (sax, mandolin, harmonica, vocals), Andr\u00E9 Jung (drums), S\u00E9rgio Britto (keyboards, vocals) and Ciro Pessoa (vocals). Pessoa quickly left the band even before their debut album, Tit\u00E3s, was released. Andr\u00E9 Jung was the initial drummer, but just after Tit\u00E3s he also quit and was replaced by Charles Gavin, establishing their classic line-up. Since then, the band lost four members who were never officially replaced: in 1992, Antunes left to pursue a solo career. In 2002, Fromer died after being hit by a motorcycle in S\u00E3o Paulo. Six months later, Reis also left the group to focus on his solo albums. The most recent change was the departure of Gavin, in 2010, due to personal reasons. After Fromer's death and Reis' departure, the band performed with some session guitarists and bassists, but ended up having Mello and Britto as full-time bassists (with Britto performing only when Mello sings) and Miklos as the rhythm guitarist. After Gavin left, the band has been working with Mario Fabre, a session drummer. The band has released their latest album in May 2014, titled Nheengatu."@en ;

dbr:The_Move	rdf:type	dbo:Band ;
	dbo:abstract	"The Move were one of the leading British rock bands of the 1960s from Birmingham, England. Despite scoring nine Top 20 UK singles in just five years, they were among the most popular British bands not to find any real success in the United States. Although bassist-vocalist Chris \"Ace\" Kefford was the original leader, for most of their career, the Move was led by guitarist, singer and songwriter Roy Wood. He wrote all the group's UK singles and, from 1968, also sang lead vocals on many songs, although Carl Wayne was the main lead singer up to 1970. Initially, the band had 4 main vocalists (Wayne, Wood, Trevor Burton and Kefford) who split the lead vocals on a number of their earlier songs. The Move evolved from several mid-1960s Birmingham based groups, including Carl Wayne & the Vikings, the Nightriders and the Mayfair Set. Their name referred to the move various members of these bands made to form the group. Besides Wood, The Move's original five-piece roster in 1965 was drummer Bev Bevan, bassist Kefford, vocalist Carl Wayne and guitarist Trevor Burton. The final line-up of 1972 was the trio of Wood, Bevan and Jeff Lynne; together, they rode the group's transition into the Electric Light Orchestra. From 2007 to 2014, Burton and Bevan have been performing as 'The Move featuring Bev Bevan and Trevor Burton'."@en ;

dbr:Within_Temptation	rdf:type	dbo:Band ;
	dbo:abstract	"Within Temptation is a Dutch symphonic metal band founded in 1996 by vocalist Sharon den Adel and guitarist Robert Westerholt. They have always been classified by critics as gothic metal or rock, although the \"gothic\" influence varies with each album. Their most prominent and well-known sound is described as symphonic metal, although their earlier material, such as debut album Enter, was mostly gothic metal. Enter even had a hint of doom metal. In an interview, Den Adel said they fell into a symphonic rock genre with various influences. In a later interview with Dutch music platform 3VOOR12, den Adel stated that \"we consider ourselves more a symphonic rock band ... in my opinion, we are no gothic band\". After the release of their debut album Enter in 1997, the band became prominent in the Dutch underground scene. It was not until 2001 that they became known to the general public, with the single \"Ice Queen\" from their second album Mother Earth, which reached No. 2 on the Dutch charts. This was followed by the band winning the Conamus Exportprijs, a Dutch music award, four years in a row. Their next albums The Silent Force (2004) and The Heart of Everything (2007) debuted at No. 1 on the Dutch charts. In 2008, they released a live DVD and CD, Black Symphony, recorded with the Metropole Orchestra. This was followed in 2009 by An Acoustic Night at the Theatre, another live album. The band's fifth studio album, The Unforgiving, was released in March 2011, alongside both a comic book series and a series of short films that together encompass a story. The first single, \"Faster\", was released on January 21, and the first short film, Mother Maiden, was released on January 31. The band has sold more than 3 million copies of the album worldwide. Their sixth studio album, Hydra, was released on January 22, 2014 in Japan, on January 31, 2014 in Europe, and on February 4, 2014 in the United States. The album features guest appearances from various artists: Finnish singer Tarja Turunen, who appears in the lead single \"Paradise (What About Us?)\"; Howard Jones, former vocalist of American metalcore band Killswitch Engage; Dave Pirner, lead vocalist of American alternative rock band Soul Asylum; and American rapper Xzibit. The band had extensive airplay on BBC Radio 2 in the United Kingdom with one of the songs from the album, \"Whole World Is Watching\" featuring Pirner. The band is currently working on new material and is due to tour The Netherlands as part of their \"Theater Tour\", a seated show. During 2014, they parted ways with artist management agency AT Productions and signed with Martijn Swier, with whom they had been working for many years."@en ;

The band got their name from the album Pornograffitti by the band Extreme. They currently record under the SME Records label. Haruichi Shind\u014D originally formed the band with his cousin during high school and named it \"No Score.\" After the band started, Haruichi asked Akihito Okano and Masami \"Tama\" Shiratama to join. The band was so named because none of them could actually read a score when they first started. When they first started the band, Haruichi was the vocalist, but found out that Akihito could sing better, so he gave the vocalist position to Akihito and took over as guitarist instead. This was the foundation of Porno Graffitti. They debuted with the song Apollo in 1999. Their two subsequent CD singles, Saudade and Agehach\u014D, both sold over a million copies in Japan. They are also well known for the song Melissa, which was used as the opening theme of the anime series Fullmetal Alchemist in 2003. They also created the song Hitori no Yoru, used as the second opening theme of the anime series GTO in 2000, and Winding Road, used as the ending theme of the anime series Ayakashi Ayashi in 2006. A cover of their 2000 single Music Hour was featured in a stage of the Nintendo DS rhythm game Moero! Nekketsu Rhythm Damashii Osu! Tatakae! Ouendan 2. Their single Koyoi, Tsuki ga, Miezu Tomo was featured in the third Bleach film, and their single Anima Rossa was featured as the eleventh opening to Bleach. Their single \"2012Spark\" was featured as the main theme song of the movie Gyakuten Saiban.

dbr:Sun_Caged	rdf:type	dbo:Band ;
	dbo:abstract	"Sun Caged was a progressive metal band originating in the Netherlands. Sun Caged was formed by ex-Lemur Voice guitarist Marcel Coenen and drummer Dennis Leeflang in the spring of 1999. Taking influences from artists in the metal genre such as Dream Theater, and Iron Maiden, Sun Caged has a unique sound which also incorporates influences from jazz and fusion. They have performed as support acts for bands such as Vanden Plas, Queensr\u00FFche, Spock's Beard, and Fates Warning. Currently, the band has three albums, a self-titled studio album which was released on October 22, 2003, a second album, Artemisia, which was released on March 23, 2007 and the third album was released in 2011 and is called \"The Lotus Effect\". All three albums received critical acclaim from the media. The style stated by the band on their 2000 demo was rather experimental, with the use of female vocals, death growls, some melodic vocals with a touch of groove. After the release of their debut album the line up of Sun Caged changed considerably. When the recordings of Artemisia had started, Coenen was the only band member left from the original line up. Leeflang left shortly after the release of the band's debut to pursue a musical career in New York and was replaced by Roel van Helden. After singer Andr\u00E9 Vuurboom left to form Sphere Of Souls he was replaced by the American Paul Adrian Villarreal. With the departure of Vuurboom keyboard player Joost van den Broek also parted ways with Sun Caged to join After Forever, a Dutch gothic metal outfit. Ren\u00E9 Kroon was hired as Van den Broek's substitute. Shortly before the Artemisia recording sessions bass player Rob van der Loo left as well. He went to join Dutch gothic metal band Delain and was replaced by Roel Vink. The band's third studio album, The Lotus Effect, was released on June 17, 2011 through Lion Music. It was described as a balance between their eponymous debut and the more melodic second album, Artemisia."@en ;

The band's name comes from The Gore Gore Girls, a 1972 B-movie by Herschell Gordon Lewis, which is a parody of the term Go Go Girls. Like fellow Detroit bands The White Stripes and The Detroit Cobras, the band started out struggling through the local club circuit before being \"discovered\" by independent record label Get Hip Records in 1998. Their first single \"Mama in the Movies\" (1999) gained favourable airplay on college radio stations in Michigan, which led to recording their first full-length album Strange Girls in (2000). The second album Up All Night, was released in 2002 and received positive press from the Village Voice and Detroit Free Press. During this time the band toured Europe twice, in 2002 and in 2003, also with infrequent dates in the United States. The band became a four-piece in 2004 with the addition of The Hammer (Marlene Hammerle) on guitar and began touring the United States extensively. Gore Gore Girls toured as direct support for The Cramps in 2003 and 2004. The band released an EP in 2004, 7 X 4, which became part of their third album, Get the Gore. Tracks from the EP and subsequent third album received airplay on Little Steven's Underground Garage Program on Sirius Satellite Radio; the band was featured at Little Steven's Underground Garage Festival on Randall's Island, New York along with other 'garage rock' luminaries and legends The Stooges, The Strokes, The New York Dolls, The Zombies and others.

dbr:Sam_Gopal	rdf:type	dbo:Band ;
	dbo:abstract	"Sam Gopal (also called Sam Gopal's Dream) was an underground British Psychedelic rock band. The band was named after its founder, Sam Gopal, born in Malaysia. From the age of seven, he played tabla, a northern Indian percussion instrument, which replaced drums in the band. The first line-up was Sam Gopal on tabla, Mick Hutchinson on guitar, Pete Sears on bass guitar and keys, and later towards the end, Andy Clark on organ and vocals. On 28 April 1967, the band performed at The 14 Hour Technicolor Dream, a UK Underground event organised by the International Times at Alexandra Palace. Other performing bands included Pink Floyd, The Pretty Things, Savoy Brown, The Crazy World of Arthur Brown, Soft Machine and The Move. Sam Gopal's Dream played at the UFO Club (their first show), The Electric Garden in Covent Garden (later to become Middle Earth), The Roundhouse, and Happening 44. They later played the Christmas on Earth Show at Olympia in London with Traffic, Jimi Hendrix and Pink Floyd. Jimi Hendrix later sat in with the original Sam Gopal's Dream at London's Speakeasy Club. Andy Clark later joined on organ and keyboards and they soon changed their name to Vamp with the addition of Viv Prince on drums, and released a single called, \"Floatin\" on Atlantic. After the original Sam Gopal Dream band broke up in 1968, Sears went on to session work and formed his own band Giant, while Hutchinson and Clark recorded three albums as 'Clark-Hutchinson'. Sam formed a new line-up which included vocalist-guitarist 'Ian Willis' (better known as Lemmy), Roger D'Elia and Phil Duke. The album Escalator was recorded in late 1968 and released in March 1969. Lemmy went on to be the bassist of Hawkwind and, in 1975, the founder, singer and bassist of Mot\u00F6rhead. Roger D\u2019Elia (who was grandson of the actress Mary Clare) later turned up in a mid-1970s band called Glider, which included Twink (ex-The Fairies), Andy Colquhoun and Chas McKay. A further line-up of the band featured Alan Mark, Mox Gowland, Mickey Waller (also known as Mickey Finn) and Freddie Gandy (ex-The Fairies). Sam Gopal self released another album Father Mucker in 1999 (GPS CD 001, Munchen, Germany). Songs from that album were recorded in 1990 (many with Andy Clark) but not mixed and overdubed until 1999, in which year he recorded one more song for the album. Sam Gopal have another six albums recorded with professional musicians and mastered but they are still unreleased. On Father Mucker Sam Gopal showed on expanded tablas how blues can be played on tablas. Father Mucker, musically and production-wise, is much better than Escalator, according to some critics and fans, which is not strange because Lemmy said he wrote Escalator in one night."@en ;

The Color Fred was featured on a compilation by Equal Vision Records in 2005. Mascherino has worked with Macbeth Athletics to design and produce the F. P. Mascho, as part of Macbeth's Studio Projects. The shoe displays the drawings of Jude Ianelli that also appear on The Color Fred's official website, and some lyrics. On October 4, 2007, Fred left Taking Back Sunday to concentrate on his new project full-time. Bend to Break is TCF's first full-length album and was released on October 30, 2007. The album hit #8 on the Billboard Heatseekers chart. As of early fall 2008, The Color Fred now has a modlife site. The Color Fred released The Intervention EP in April 2009. The EP features new and old songs performed acoustic, plus two home demos. A DVD has been in the works for the band since early 2008. It will contrast the differences between life on the road with The Color Fred and Fred's former band, Taking Back Sunday. The project is currently on hold as Fred is focusing on his new band, Terrible Things with Andy Jackson and Josh Eppard. On the The Color Fred's Myspace page, Fred said the following about his solo project: \"A lot of people have been asking about TCF as well. I still love all the songs I've put out through that so it will continue to be my solo project that I'll do when the new band is on break... if it ever is! But I really feel that if you were ever a fan of the music I've been so lucky to make over the years, you won't be let down by the Terrible Things record. I want to thank you guys especially for supporting me all these years and especially during the last 2 years while I was rebuilding and rethinking everything about what I do. It really helped to have my TCF fans when things got hard. I won't let you guys down-Fred\" In 2012, Fred toured as The Color Fred for the Super Karate Tour"@en ;

Hokus Pick was well known for their quirky sense of humour, using sarcasm, satire, and general silliness to convey a deeper message. Hokus Pick toured extensively in Canada and the United States. The band opened for Steve Taylor's Squinternational tour in 1994 and played in Costa Rica in May 1998. The group released their final album in 1999, opting to spend more time with their families after more than a decade of recording and touring together. They have remained active in music ministry and the industry. The Encyclopedia of Contemporary Christian Music cites their song \"I'm So Happy\" as possibly the Greatest CCM song of all time. The song is a satire of simplistic lyrics often heard on Christian radio. It received heavy rotation on Christian stations. In October 2007 Hokus Pick received a Lifetime Achievement Award from the Canadian Gospel Music Association at the 29th Annual Covenant Awards in Calgary, Alberta. Hokus Pick then performed live and hosted the 30th Annual Covenant Awards on October 24, 2008. Rumours abounded that Hokus Pick was planning a comeback into music, after having been spotted in a secluded warehouse jamming together.

Right before the release of their first album C-Murder & Krazy were added to the lineup. This lineup was intact on their debut, 'Goodfellas' which contained the hit \"Wobble Wobble\" produced by Carlos Stephens, which peaked at #17 in the U.S.; the album was noted for showing a more direct influence from New Orleans' bounce music sound than had earlier No Limit releases. After No Limit Records moved over from Priority Records to Universal Records, their lineup was altered from the first album titled Goodfellas, C-Murder was incarcerated, Mystikal who had left the label not long after the Goodfellas album was released was also incarcerated so the only returning members were Magic, Krazy, Master P & Silkk The Shocker. Their new line up consisted of Choppa, Curren$y, Krazy, Magic, Master P, Silkk The Shocker & T-Bo for their second album, Ballers, which includes the hit single Tight Whips.

Ceolt\u00F3ir\u00ED is the Irish word for musicians, and Cualann is the name of an area just outside Dublin where \u00D3 Riada lived. \u00D3 Riada's work with Ceolt\u00F3ir\u00ED Chualann is credited with revitalizing the use of the bodhr\u00E1n as a percussion instrument in Celtic music. In 1960 \u00D3 Riada was looking for musicians to perform music for the play \"The Song of the Anvil\" by Bryan MacMahon. Paddy Moloney, at the age of 20, was called to participate in the project, along with his friend Sean Potts on tin whistle, Sonny Brogan on accordion and John Kelly on flute. They rehearsed weekly in \u00D3 Riada's house in Galloping Green, on the outskirts of Dublin. Following its success, \u00D3 Riada had the idea of forming Ceolt\u00F3ir\u00ED Chualann, a band to play traditional Irish songs with accompaniment and traditional dance tunes and slow airs, arranged with instruments: harpsichord, bodhran, piano, fiddle, accordions, flute, pipes and whistles. The idea of actually arranging folk music, or dance music, had been done on at least one or two 78rpm recordings in the past, but they were folk tunes done in a classical way, highly orchestrated.Another aim was to revitalize the work of blind harpist and composer Turlough O'Carolan. The band was launched during the Dublin Theatre Festival in September 1960, at the Shelbourne Hotel, at an event called Reacaireacht an Riadaigh (\u00D3 Riada's Recital). Included in the program were traditional singers, writer Se\u00E1n \u00D3 R\u00EDord\u00E1in and poet Se\u00E1n \u00D3 Tuama. In March of the following year \u00D3 Riada recorded the first of a series of radio programmes for which he retained the name Reacaireacht an Riadaigh, and included music played by Ceolt\u00F3ir\u00ED Chualann. Soon after the band's formation, Peadar Mercier and Se\u00E1n Keane joined. Ceolt\u00F3ir\u00ED Chualann continued to play until 1969. During that year they recorded two albums, \u00D3 Riada and \u00D3 Riada Sa Gaiety. The latter of those two albums was not released until after 1971, when Se\u00E1n \u00D3 Riada died."@en ;

Its most popular line-up (which lasted from 1977-1999) was Martin Plaza (birth name Martin Murphy) on vocals and guitar; Reg Mombassa (birth name Chris O'Doherty) on lead guitar and vocals; his brother Peter \"Yoga Dog\" O'Doherty on bass guitar and vocals; Wayne \"Bird\" Delisle (birth name David Twohill) on drums; and Andrew \"Greedy\" Smith on vocals, keyboards and harmonica. Their original hit songs were generated by Mombassa, O'Doherty, Plaza and Smith, either individually or collectively; they also hit the Australian charts with covers of songs by Roy Orbison, Elvis Presley and Chuck Berry. Their top ten Australian singles are \"If You Leave Me, Can I Come Too?\" and \"Too Many Times\" (both from 1981), \"Live It Up\" (1985) and \"Rock and Roll Music\" (1988). Internationally, \"Too Many Times\" made the Canadian top 40 in 1982, and \"Live It Up\" peaked at No. 3 in UK, No. 4 in Norway, and No. 6 in Germany, after it featured in the 1986 Australian film \"Crocodile\" Dundee. All of the early members are visual artists and have had combined studio displays, some have had solo studio displays with Mombassa's artwork also used as designs by the Mambo clothing company. The majority of the group's record covers, posters and video clips have been designed and created by themselves or their art school contemporaries. On 27 August 2009, Mental As Anything was inducted into the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) Hall of Fame alongside Kev Carmody, The Dingoes, Little Pattie and John Paul Young."@en ;

dbr:Roger_Miret_and_The_Disasters	rdf:type	dbo:Band ;
	dbo:abstract	"Roger Miret and the Disasters are a street punk group formed by Agnostic Front frontman Roger Miret. The band started when Miret was writing songs that were not a style suitable for Lady Luck (a band fronted by his wife Denise) or Agnostic Front, so he starting recording them on his own on a Boss recorder. Johnny Rioux had previously mentioned he would like to work with him, so Rioux helped Miret on what originally started as a solo project. Then Miret met Rhys Kill, who liked the material and joined in on the project. The band then recorded a demo tape, with Miret and Kill on guitar, Rioux on bass and Matt Kelly from the Dropkick Murphys on drums. That six-song demo found reviewed by Lars Frederiksen, who passed it off to his Rancid bandmate Tim Armstrong. He asked Miret to put his project out on Hellcat Records. As Kelly could not continue with Miret due to his commitments with Dropkick Murphys, Miret asked Johnny Kray of The Krays and New York Rel-X to join on drums. After a couple rehearsals, they decided to make it a band. Their first recorded appearances were in 2001, with \"It's Alright\", from the six-song demo with Matt Kelly, appearing on Scene Killer 3 and covers of Cock Sparrer's \"England Belongs to Me\" (dubbed \"New York Belongs to Me\") and Blitz's \"Voice of a Generation\" appearing on The Worldwide Tribute to the Real Oi! Volume 2. Their debut release was their self-titled album, which came out in September 2002. The band's first lineup change came with Joey Nails replacing Rioux on bass by August 2003. It was then announced in January 2004 that Chris Watson replaced Nails and then Brian Darwas took over for drums as of April 2004, leaving only Miret and Kill as original members. Following one more lineup change, with Darwas moving over to bass and Mike Mulieri taking over drums as of September 2004, the band recorded their second album in Fall 2004. The album, 1984, was released early the next year and became their last release on Hellcat. The next year, they released My Riot on Sailor's Grave Records. In January 2011, the band released their fourth album, Gotta Get Up Now, on German label People Like You Records."@en ;

dbr:Television_Personalities	rdf:type	dbo:Band ;
	dbo:abstract	"The Television Personalities are an English rock group led by singer\u2013songwriter Dan Treacy (born 19 June 1960). The band's first release (January 1978) was the single \"14th Floor\"/\"Oxford Street W1\", while their second, the EP Where's Bill Grundy Now? features one of their best-known songs, \"Part Time Punks\". The Television Personalities' first album ...And Don't The Kids Just Love It was released in 1981. It set the template for their subsequent career: neo-psychedelia, an obsession with youth culture of the 1960s, a fey, slightly camp lyrical attitude, and the occasional classic pop song. Their second album Mummy Your Not Watching Me [sic] demonstrated increased psychedelic influences. Their third album, entitled They Could Have Been Bigger Than The Beatles showed Treacy's sense of humour; the TVPs were never to have any major commercial success in the UK \u2013 although their albums sold respectably in Germany, Sweden and the Netherlands. The first three albums featured Treacy and schoolmate Ed Ball; Ball left the band[when?] to found The Times, but rejoined in 2004. The band were offered the support slot on Pink Floyd guitarist David Gilmour's 1984 UK solo dates, but were promptly dropped after reading out former Pink Floyd member Syd Barrett's home address. The 1984 album The Painted Word was unexpectedly dark in content, reflecting Treacy's despair at Thatcherite Britain and his personal circumstances. Various lineup changes prevented their next album (Privilege) from appearing until 1990. Their subsequent album Closer to God was a combination of fey sixties style pop and darker material, similar in tone to The Painted Word. The album Don't Cry Baby, It's Only a Movie was released in 1998. From 1998 to June 2004, Dan Treacy was incarcerated for shoplifting to feed his drug habit. He spent time aboard HM Prison ship Weare in Portland Harbour, Dorset, England. He has referred to the Weare as \"The Good Ship Lollipop\". The experience helped him put his life and career back on track. In February 2006, a new TVPs album, My Dark Places was released. Despite their relatively small independent sales, the TVPs were very influential on British music in the 1980s, especially the so-called C86 generation and many of the bands on Creation Records. In an article in The Guardian on 24 April 2006, it was implied that Dan Treacy was in some way behind the Arctic Monkeys, although this was based on little more than a perceived similarity between their lyrical style and that of Treacy, and the fact that the lead singer of Arctic Monkeys, Alex Turner is not credited with the band's songwriting. It was reported in October 2011 that Treacy was seriously ill after an operation to remove a blood clot from his brain."@en ;

This differs from the music he and the fellow Reel Big Fish member Dan Regan had been performing previously, but the new piano-bar style was well received by fans. Often, both bands would play at the same venue. LMB has not performed since May 25, 2005, and rumors have circulated regarding the band's break-up.

	dbo:abstract	"Idiot Flesh was an American experimental rock band formed in Oakland, California in 1985, initially under the name Acid Rain. Their work was characterized by its \"rock against rock\" attitude and defied classification with its incorporation of marching band routines, puppet shows, and the playing of household items as tuned instruments. Adopting the Idiot Flesh moniker in 1987, they went on to release three full-length albums before disbanding in 1998. Founding members Nils Frykdahl and Dan Rathbun later played in Sleepytime Gorilla Museum, while Gene Jun later joined the Sun and Moon Ensemble."@en ;

dbr:The_Axemen	rdf:type	dbo:Band ;
	dbo:abstract	"The Axemen is a New Zealand band formed in 1983. They played at the protests for homosexual law reform in 1983, with member Little Stevie McCabe being severely beaten up in the Christchurch Cathedral Square toilets. The Axemen's founding members, Bob Brannigan, Little Stevie McCabe and Stu Kawowski had played in various bands, apart and together, in the South Island cities of Christchurch and Dunedin. Before Bob Brannigan and Steve McCabe met, Steve was playing in a two-piece band at Cashmere High School called The Gorillas with Peter Rees, evolving comix maestro and classical guitarist. Brannigan and McCabe met through a mutual friend and played gigs in Christchurch and Dunedin under many names including The Whining Plums, Hey, We're Wolves and The Twins in the early '80s. It was at a Twins gig at the notorious Empire Tavern in Dunedin in 1983 where Stu Kawowski was first unable to control himself and leapt on stage to commandeer the bongos, instantly adding another dimension to the unit. Art School Photography graduate, photography guru, filmmaker, artist, promotional maverick and explosives expert Kawowski was playing drums with Above Ground, Bill Direen's band at the time he met the other members of the Axemen and soon 'joined' the Axemen as a permanent fixture. Brannigan, McCabe and Kawowski remained the 'core' of the Axemen in the 20th century, however many New Zealand musicians played with them over the years as guest / transient / semi-permanent members, making their influence and the influences they assimilated (like the borg) an important breeding ground and virtual swap-meet of ideas and influence in Kiwi music circles. In February 2009, US record label Siltbreeze re-released the Axemen's 1984 protest album :Big Cheap Motel\" on 12\" vinyl. Originally the album was released as a cassette packaged in a small bubble-sleeve with a straw, mimicking the milk drink \"Big M\" that the album was aimed at. The Axemen were invited to play at Christchurch's \"Summertimes\" Festival in January 1984, a public music stage set up in Hagley Park. The band was shocked by the large-scale sexist \"Big M\" advertising surrounding the main stage, and decided to write a suite of protest songs about how the Christchurch City Council had \"sold out\" to the \"Big M\" sexist marketing. The Axemen recorded the concert, as well as studio versions of their songs and released a 45 min cassette entitled, \"Big Cheap Motel\". Siltbreeze later the same year re-released 'Scary! pt III', an experimental album featuring small-form collaborations with sublime Chch artist Lissa Bruce, and multiple band incarnations from the late 80's and early 90's. A four piece Axemen (McCabe, Brannigan, Kawowski & Stojanovic) toured USA extensively for 5 weeks October/November 2009, opening for \"Times New Viking\" (Matador Records).Starting out on the West Coast in Sacramento 27 October, travelling down the West Coast, across the South, up the east to New York then heading west and ending in Chicago on 28 November. The band played 26 shows and covered approx 7,000 miles on the tour. AXEMEN 2009 USA TOUR MAP The Axemen's debut 2xLP \"Three Virgins :: Three Versions :: Three Visions\" was re-issued and released on 7 June 2011 by Siltbreeze. This album was originally released on New Zealand label Flying Nun Records in 1985. The first pressing was 667 copies made at the now closed EMI pressing plant in Lower Hutt, NZ. A mint copy of the 1985 vinyl was \"needle drop\" transferred to digital files at Shadoks Music Studio, Amrum, Germany. Then it was mastered at Fir International, Zaandam, Netherlands, and lacquers cut at Prairie Cat Mastering, Belvidere, IL 61008 USA. The vinyl was pressed at Record Technology Inc., Camarillo, CA 93012-8090, USA. A four-piece AXEMEN incarnation featuring McCabe, Kawowski, Stojanovic and newcomer William Daymond toured Australia in December 2011, a new line up that added William Daymond on bass guitar, allowing Dragan Stojanovic to resume his lead guitar duties. Bob Brannigan declined an invitation to join the band on this tour, due to irreconcilable differences with Steve McCabe. Originally the band were to headline a festival in Wandella, South New South Wales, but due to bureaucratic red tape, this festival was cancelled. The organiser Samuel Miers (School Girl Report) then proceeded to book the AXEMEN into 10 dates starting at Brisbane, and ending in Adelaide on 23 December. The tour was blogged in great detail by Li'l Stevie McCabe on the AXEMEN's Y2k blog. Midway during the Australian tour Steve McCabe's shoulder was fractured after he was attacked by a wild Australian punter. In 2012, the AXEMEN headlined a Christchurch 1980's reunion concert at the Dux Live venue in Christchurch, and also did a mid-winter pair of shows at Mighty Mighty in Wellington 22 June, and Wunderbar Lyttleton on 23 June. The 'Class of 2011' Axemen (McCabe, Kawowski, Stojanovic, Daymond) recorded a new vinyl album 'Sac Tap Nut Jam' in Wellington in 2013 which was released through Spacecase Records, California. 2014 saw the re-release of 1989's Derry Legend on vinyl by Luxury Products USA after 100% analogue re-mastering by Angus McNaughton of Auralax Mastering in Auckland. The re-release package contained a newsprint poster and single sheet fold-out newsprint collection of media reviews and photos from the AXEMEN archives. The re-issue was also available as an audio CD, and as a compact cassette."@en ;

Ten years later Graeme Humphreys and Peter Keen regrouped to record an album, The Overflow, under the name of Humphreys & Keen. The band's style of music could be considered as similar to the prevalent Dunedin Sound favoured by Flying Nun during the 1980s and 1990s and most effective[citation needed] when keyboards (not normally prominent in the Dunedin Sound) were to the fore, as on their early student radio hit \"Snow White Chook.\" Graeme Humphreys is now better known in New Zealand for his role as a radio talkback host (under the name Graeme Hill)."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"AC/DC are an Australian hard rock band, formed in November 1973 by brothers Malcolm and Angus Young, who continued as members until Malcolm's illness and departure in 2014. Commonly referred to as a hard rock or blues rock band, they are also considered pioneers of heavy metal and are sometimes classified as such, though they have always dubbed their music as simply \"rock and roll\". AC/DC underwent several line-up changes before releasing their first album, High Voltage, on 17 February 1975; Malcolm and Angus were the only original members left in the band. Membership subsequently stabilised until bassist Mark Evans was replaced by Cliff Williams in 1977 for the album Powerage. Within months of recording the album Highway to Hell, lead singer and co-songwriter Bon Scott died on 19 February 1980 after a night of heavy alcohol consumption. The group considered disbanding, but buoyed by support from Scott's parents, decided to continue and set about finding a new vocalist. Ex-Geordie singer Brian Johnson was auditioned and selected to replace Scott. Later that year, the band released the new album, Back in Black, which was made as a tribute to Bon Scott. The album launched them to new heights of success and became their all-time best-seller. The band's next album, For Those About to Rock We Salute You, was their first album to reach number one in the United States. AC/DC declined in popularity soon after drummer Phil Rudd was fired in 1983 and was replaced by ex-A II Z drummer Simon Wright, who left to join Dio in 1989.

The group was founded by former Black Flag vocalist Keith Morris and Red Kross guitarist Greg Hetson. They were among the pre-eminent hardcore punk bands of the LA scene in the late 1970s. The band broke up and reformed three times, sometimes with different bassists and/or drummers. They disbanded for the first time after the release of their fifth album, 1987's VI, as Hetson decided to continue touring and releasing albums with Bad Religion. They reunited around 1994 and recorded a reunion album, Oddities, Abnormalities and Curiosities, during the following year, followed by a tour. After that, the Circle Jerks once again parted ways as Hetson was still involved in Bad Religion. They reunited again c. 2001, but as of 2010, are on hiatus. To date, Circle Jerks have released six studio albums, one compilation, a live album and a live DVD. Their last studio album, Oddities, Abnormalities and Curiosities, was released in 1995 and was the band's only reunion album to date. Many recent groups and artists cite Circle Jerks as an influence, including Flea, Anti-Flag, Dropkick Murphys, The Offspring and Pennywise."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Emerson, Lake & Powell, sometimes abbreviated as ELPowell or ELP2, were an English progressive rock band, an offshoot or variant lineup of Emerson, Lake & Palmer, that released one official studio album in 1986. Keith Emerson and Greg Lake had planned to re-form the original ELP in 1985 but drummer Carl Palmer was unavailable because of contractual obligations to Asia. After auditioning a series of drummers unwilling to commit to the band, they approached Cozy Powell, a longtime friend of Emerson's, to replace him. The band have always insisted that it was a coincidence that his surname also happened to start with a P, thus allowing the band to retain its original initials, although they also joked about looking for a \"Gene Prupa\" and having approached \"Phil Pollins\" and \"Ringo Parr\" before Powell agreed to join. Shortly into recording, Emerson's barn studio was destroyed by a runaway tractor, requiring some parts of the album be rerecorded, leading him to joke, \"Perhaps we should have called it 'Emerson, Lake & Plow!'\" The band's self-titled studio album was a return to the familiar ELP style, with long progressive rock suites, mellow ballads and a classical theme (\"Mars, the Bringer of War\" by Gustav Holst, a piece previously performed by Lake during his tenure in King Crimson). One song, \"The Score\", even references the lyric \"Welcome back, my friends, to the show that never ends\" from ELP's \"Karn Evil 9: First Impression\" (on the album Brain Salad Surgery). Initially, when the record company suggested that the group perform \"Mars,\" Emerson refused, saying it would be like ELP Plays the Classics or Richard Clayderman Plays 'Clair de Lune'. After Powell showed him a video of one of his former bands playing the number, however, Emerson agreed to try it. In live performance the band also performed classic ELP and Nice material. The band's live tour was marred by a dispute which led to the band firing its management, and \"ELPowell\" disbanded without recording a second album. Emerson rejoined Palmer and with Robert Berry formed the band 3 in 1988, before the original ELP lineup reformed for 1992's album Black Moon, which bears some stylistic similarities to the Emerson, Lake & Powell album. Some ELPowell studio rehearsals and live recordings found their way onto bootlegs in the 1990s. The material was subsequently remastered and given an official release on two 2003 CDs, available via the ELP website. Cozy Powell died at age 50 on April 5, 1998, following a car crash."@en ;

The group is composed of eight (formerly nine) members: Taeyeon, Sunny, Tiffany, Hyoyeon, Yuri, Sooyoung, Yoona, and Seohyun. Girls' Generation officially debuted on August 5, 2007 with its debut single \"Into the New World\" and subsequently gained some attention with their self-titled debut album. However, it was not until 2009 that they rose to prominence with the single \"Gee\", which claimed the top spot on KBS's Music Bank for a record-breaking nine consecutive weeks and was named the most popular song of the 2000s decade by Melon. The group solidified their place in the South Korean music industry with follow-up singles \"Tell Me Your Wish (Genie)\", \"Oh!\", and \"Run Devil Run\" from late 2009 to early 2010. In mid-2010, the group signed with Nayutawave Records (present-day EMI Records Japan) to embark into the Japanese music scene. In April 2011, Girls' Generation's Japanese self-titled debut album was released, which peaked atop the Japanese Oricon Albums Chart and became the first album by a South Korean girl group to achieve a double Platinum certification by the RIAJ. The group returned to the South Korean music scene in October 2011 with The Boys, which has sold over 457,000 copies in South Korea, becoming the best-selling album in the Gaon chart history since its launch in 2010. During this time, the group also expanded their endeavor to the United States by signing with Interscope Records. In 2013, Girls' Generation's fourth Korean studio album titled I Got a Boy was released. The title track was subjected to major attention from western media after it was awarded Video of the Year at the inaugural YouTube Music Awards. Girls' Generation has sold over 4.4 million albums and 30 million digital singles as of 2012. The group's immense popularity in its native South Korea has earned them numerous accolades, notably titles such as \"The Nation's Singers\" and \"The Nation's Girl Group\". Girls' Generation is also regarded as the most popular K-pop girl group in Japan alongside Kara; the group is the first South Korean girl group to have two number-one albums on the Japanese Oricon Albums Chart.

	dbo:abstract	"Skinny Puppy is a Canadian industrial music group, formed in Vancouver, British Columbia, in 1982. The group is widely considered to be one of the founders of the electro-industrial genre. The band's logo consists of the stylized, superimposed letters SP and is a common fan tattoo. Initially envisioned as an experimental side project by cEvin Key while he was in the new wave band Images in Vogue, Skinny Puppy evolved into a full-time project with the addition of vocalist Nivek Ogre. Over the course of a dozen studio albums and many live tours, Key and Ogre have been the only constant members. Other members have included Dwayne Goettel (1986\u20131995), Dave \"Rave\" Ogilvie (long-time associate, producer, and \"unofficial\" fourth member until 1995), Mark Walk (2003\u2013present), and a number of guests, including Bill Leeb (1985\u20131986, under the pseudonym Wilhelm Schroeder), Al Jourgensen (1989), and many others. After the self-release of their first cassette in 1984, Skinny Puppy soon signed to Vancouver label Nettwerk, anchoring its early roster. From their Nettwerk debut EP Remission in 1984 to their 1992 album Last Rights, Skinny Puppy developed into an influential band with a dedicated cult following, fusing elements of ambient, noise, new wave, electro, and rock music and making innovative use of sampling. Over the course of several tours of North America and Europe in this period, they became known for theatrical, horror-themed live performances and videos, drawing attention to issues such as chemical warfare and animal testing. In 1993, Skinny Puppy left Nettwerk and long-time producer Rave, signing with American Recordings and relocating to Malibu, California, where drug problems and tension between band members plagued the recording of their next album, The Process. Ogre quit Skinny Puppy in June 1995, and Goettel died of a heroin overdose two months later. The album was completed with Rave and released in Goettel's memory in 1996. Key and Ogre, already active in a number of other projects, went their separate ways, reuniting for a one-off Skinny Puppy concert at the Doomsday Festival in Dresden, Germany, in 2000. Reforming Skinny Puppy in 2003 with Mark Walk, they have since released three albums on the German label Synthetic Symphony, and toured extensively."@en ;

The Angels were cited by Guns N' Roses and a number of Seattle grunge bands, including Pearl Jam and Nirvana, as having influenced their music. In the international market, to avoid legal problems with the Casablanca Records' act Angel, their records were released under the names Angel City and later The Angels from Angel City. Lead singer Doc Neeson who fronted the band from 1974-1999 left pre-Millenium due to spinal injuries sustained in a car accident. After spending most of the 2000s apart, in April 2008, the original 1970s line-up of The Angels reformed for a series of tours. In January 2013 it was announced that lead singer Doc Neeson had been diagnosed with a brain tumour and would undergo immediate treatment. Neeson died aged 67.

Originally an alternative hip hop group, they subsequently added R&B and EDM influences. Although the group was founded in Los Angeles in 1995, it was not until the release of their third album Elephunk in 2003 that they achieved high record sales. Since that time, the group has sold an estimated 76 million records (35 million albums and 41 million singles), making them one of the world's best-selling groups of all time. According to Nielsen SoundScan, the Black Eyed Peas were the second-best-selling artist/group of all time for downloaded tracks, with over 42 million sales as of the end of 2011. Their first major hit was the 2003 single \"Where Is the Love?\" from Elephunk, which topped the charts in 13 countries, including the United Kingdom, where it spent seven weeks at number one and went on to become Britain's biggest selling single of 2003. Another European hit single from the album was \"Shut Up\". Their fourth album, Monkey Business, was an even bigger worldwide success, certified 4\u00D7 Platinum in the U.S., and spawning four singles, \"Don't Phunk with My Heart\", \"Don't Lie\", \"My Humps\" and \"Pump It\". In 2009, the group became one of only 11 artists to have simultaneously held the No. 1 and No. 2 spots on the Billboard Hot 100, with their singles \"Boom Boom Pow\" and \"I Gotta Feeling\", which topped the chart for an unprecedented 26 consecutive weeks. This album The E.N.D later produced a third Hot 100 number-one placement with \"Imma Be\", making the group one of few to ever place three number one singles on the chart from the same album, before being followed with \"Rock That Body\" and \"Meet Me Halfway\", which peaked in the Top 10 of the Hot 100. \"I Gotta Feeling\" became the first single to sell more than one million downloads in the United Kingdom. The Black Eyed Peas were ranked 12th on Billboard's Decade-End Chart Artist of the Decade, and 7th in the Hot 100 Artists of the Decade. At the 52nd Grammy Awards ceremony, held in January 2010, they won three awards out of six nominations. In November 2010, they released the album The Beginning. In February 2011, the group performed at the Super Bowl XLV halftime show.

During the course of their career the band released six full-length albums on the labels Hollywood Records and Side One Dummy Records. Though they experienced several lineup changes over the years, founding members Jason Navarro and Dan Lukacinsky remained regular fixtures. The band's musical style initially blended elements of punk rock, ska, and hardcore into a genre popularly known as ska punk or \"ska-core,\" which characterized their first two albums. During the middle of their career they shifted gears, moving away from this sound and producing two albums with a heavy pop rock influence. Their final two albums moved back towards their mid-1990s style, bringing back heavy ska punk and hardcore elements. Despite being signed to a major record label for their first four albums, The Suicide Machines did not experience significant mainstream success. However, they did achieve a relatively high level of underground recognition through relentless touring, including multiple performances on the Warped Tour. This trend continued when the band moved to an independent label for their last four years, before their breakup brought an abrupt end to the band's career."@en ;

The group was briefly managed by Andy Warhol, and served as the house band at the Silver Factory and Warhol's Exploding Plastic Inevitable events from 1966 to 1967. The provocative subject matter, musical experimentation, and often nihilistic attitudes explored in their music proved influential in the development of punk rock and alternative music. Their 1967 debut album The Velvet Underground & Nico featured German singer and collaborator Nico and was called the \"most prophetic rock album ever made\" by Rolling Stone in 2003. In 2004, Rolling Stone ranked the band No. 19 on its list of the \"100 Greatest Artists of All Time\". The band was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1996 by Patti Smith."@en ;

At the time, the band's sound was unlike that of any of its contemporaries in the then fledgling Japanese ska scene, and over the course of the past 21 years, their innovation has proved to have been very influential on Japanese music as a whole. Its sound, the product of the musical influences of its numerous members, is an eclectic mix of traditional ska, jazz, and rock. In the vein of many other more traditional ska acts, many of Skapara's songs are purely instrumental. Since its inception, the band has gone on several nationwide tours of Japan, and have toured extensively worldwide. They have collaborated with several vocalists outside of their band, including Shiina Ringo, Akira Kobayashi, Ky\u014Dko Koizumi, Schadaraparr, PUFFY, Yoshie Nakano and Tamio Okuda. They also performed the Japanese theme song to the PlayStation 2 game Sly Cooper and the Thievius Raccoonus, entitled Black Jack, as well as numerous songs for the PlayStation game Incredible Crisis released in 1999."@en ;

Over the last ten years Assembly of Dust has crafted a unique sound that recalls the likes of The Band, Traffic and Neil Young. They have taken that early 70's Americana swagger, put their own funky spin on it, and earned comparisons to the next generation of Americana heroes including Wilco, Michael Houser, and My Morning Jacket. What sets AOD aside from other bands, however, is their ability to improvise beautiful melodies for extended periods of time. They are similar to The Grateful Dead and other jam bands in this way, and the band has quickly become a favorite amongst jam band circles. However, in interviews Genauer has stated that while he respects the jam band scene, he believes his group's focus on songcraft puts them in a different league. AOD has traveled throughout the U.S. on several extensive tours, and they have performed at festivals such as Bonnaroo, Langerado, 10KLF, Wakarusa, All Good Music Festival, Gathering of the Vibes, Newport Folk Festival, and Wakarusa Music and Camping Festival. The band's current single \"Vaulted Sky\" from their 2013 album Sun Shot is receiving moderate airplay from Adult Alternative-formatted stations."@en ;

dbr:Bad_Religion	rdf:type	dbo:Band ;
	dbo:abstract	"Bad Religion is an American punk rock band that formed in Los Angeles, California in 1979. The band makes extensive use of soaring three-part vocal harmonies (which they refer to in their album liner notes as the \"oozin' aahs\"), guitar solos and lyrics that often contain religious and political commentary. Their lyrics often relate to matters of social responsibility. The band's lineup has changed several times over its lifespan, with lead vocalist Greg Graffin being the only consistent member; the current lineup, however, features three of the band's four original members (Graffin, Brett Gurewitz and Jay Bentley). To date, Bad Religion has released sixteen studio albums, two live albums, three compilation albums, three EPs (one of which is composed of covers of Christmas songs) and two DVDs (which were both recorded live). They are considered to be one of the best-selling punk rock acts of all time, having sold over 5 million albums worldwide. Bad Religion had built an underground following in the United States with their early albums before signing to Atlantic Records in 1993. They rose to fame that same year with their seventh studio album Recipe for Hate, which peaked at number 14 on Billboard's Heatseekers chart. Recipe for Hate was followed a year later by Stranger than Fiction, which spawned their biggest hits \"Infected\" and a re-recorded version of \"21st Century (Digital Boy)\", and was certified gold in both the United States and Canada. Shortly before the release of Stranger than Fiction, Gurewitz left Bad Religion to focus on his label Epitaph, and was replaced by Brian Baker. Since the return of Gurewitz in 2001, the band has undergone a resurgence in popularity, with their sixteenth studio album True North (2013) becoming Bad Religion's first album to crack the top 20 on the Billboard 200 chart, where it peaked at number 19. The band is expected to release their seventeenth studio album around 2017."@en ;

dbr:Bee_Gees	rdf:type	dbo:Band ;
	dbo:abstract	"The Bee Gees were a pop music group formed in 1958. Their line-up consisted of brothers Barry, Robin and Maurice Gibb. The trio were successful for most of their decades of recording music, but they had two distinct periods of exceptional success; as a popular music act in the late 1960s and early 1970s, and as prominent performers of the disco music era in the late 1970s. The group sang recognisable three-part tight harmonies; Robin's clear vibrato lead vocals were a hallmark of their earlier hits, while Barry's R&B falsetto became their signature sound during the late 1970s and 1980s. They wrote all of their own hits, as well as writing and producing several major hits for other artists. Born on the Isle of Man to English parents, the Gibb brothers lived in Chorlton, Manchester, England, until the late 1950s where they formed the Rattlesnakes. The family then moved to Redcliffe, in Queensland, Australia, and then to Cribb Island. After achieving their first chart success in Australia as the Bee Gees with \"Spicks and Specks\" (their 12th single), they returned to the UK in January 1967 where producer Robert Stigwood began promoting them to a worldwide audience. The Bee Gees have sold more than 220 million records worldwide, making them one of the world's best-selling music artists of all time. They were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1997; the presenter of the award to \"Britain's first family of harmony\" was Brian Wilson, historical leader of the Beach Boys, a \"family act\" also featuring three harmonising brothers. The Bee Gees' Hall of Fame citation says \"Only Elvis Presley, the Beatles, Michael Jackson, Garth Brooks and Paul McCartney have outsold the Bee Gees.\" Following Maurice's sudden death in January 2003 at the age of 53, Barry and Robin retired the group's name after 45 years of activity. In 2009 Robin announced that he and Barry had agreed that the Bee Gees would re-form and perform again. Robin died in May 2012 at the age of 62, after a prolonged struggle with cancer and other health problems, leaving Barry as the only surviving member of the group's final (and best known) line up."@en ;

dbr:Big_Star	rdf:type	dbo:Band ;
	dbo:abstract	"Big Star was an American power pop band formed in Memphis, Tennessee, in 1971 by Alex Chilton, Chris Bell, Jody Stephens, and Andy Hummel. Despite exceptional reviews from critics and widely acknowledged influence upon numerous notable musicians, Big Star attained only cult status, lacking commercial success. The group broke up in 1974, but reorganized with a new line-up nearly 20 years later. In its first era, the band's musical style drew on the vocal harmonies of The Beatles, as well as the swaggering rhythms of The Rolling Stones and the jangling guitars of The Byrds. To the resulting power pop, Big Star added dark, existential themes, and produced a style that foreshadowed the alternative rock of the 1980s and 1990s. Before it broke up, Big Star created a \"seminal body of work that never stopped inspiring succeeding generations\" in the words of Rolling Stone, as the \"quintessential American power pop band\" and \"one of the most mythic and influential cult acts in all of rock & roll\". Big Star's first album\u20141972's #1 Record\u2014was met by enthusiastic reviews, but ineffective marketing by Stax Records and limited distribution stunted its commercial success. Frustration took its toll on band relations: Bell left not long after the first record's commercial progress stalled, and Hummel left to finish his college education after a second album, Radio City, was completed in December, 1973. Like #1 Record, Radio City received excellent reviews, but label issues again thwarted sales\u2014Columbia Records, which had assumed control of the Stax catalog, likewise effectively vetoed its distribution. After a third album was deemed non-commercially viable and shelved before receiving a title, the band broke up late in 1974. Four years later, the first two Big Star LPs were released together in the UK as a double album. The band's third album was finally issued soon afterward; titled Third/Sister Lovers, it found limited commercial success. Shortly thereafter, Chris Bell was killed in a car accident at the age of 27. The Big Star discography drew renewed attention in the 1980s when R.E.M., and The Replacements as well as other popular bands cited the group as an influence. In 1992, interest was further stimulated by Rykodisc's reissues of the band's albums, complemented by a collection of Bell's solo work.:13 In 1993, Chilton and Stephens reformed Big Star with recruits Jon Auer and Ken Stringfellow of The Posies, and gave a concert at the University of Missouri.:253 The band remained active, performing tours in Europe and Japan,:253-260 and released a new studio album, In Space, in 2005. Chilton died on March 17, 2010, after being admitted to a New Orleans hospital with heart problems. Hummel, who was diagnosed with cancer in 2008, died on July 19, 2010. These deaths left Stephens as the sole surviving founding member. Big Star was inducted into the Memphis Music Hall of Fame in 2014."@en ;

dbr:Blind_Guardian	rdf:type	dbo:Band ;
	dbo:abstract	"Blind Guardian is a German power metal band formed in the mid-1980s in Krefeld, West Germany. They are often credited as one of the seminal and most influential bands in the power metal and speed metal subgenres. Ten musicians have been a part of the band's line-up in its history, which has consisted of singer Hansi K\u00FCrsch, guitarists Andr\u00E9 Olbrich and Marcus Siepen, and drummer Frederik Ehmke since 2005. Blind Guardian is a part of the German heavy metal scene that emerged in the mid-1980s. The band was formed in 1984 as Lucifer's Heritage by K\u00FCrsch (then also bass guitarist), Olbrich, other guitarist Markus D\u00F6rk and drummer Thomas Stauch. D\u00F6rk and Stauch both left the following year, and were replaced by Christof Thei\u00DFen and Hans-Peter Frey respectively, who left as well before the end of the year. In 1987, Siepen joined and Stauch returned; under this line-up, which lasted 18 years (the longest in the band's history), the band changed their name to Blind Guardian and released their first album, Battalions of Fear, in 1988. Over the releases, Blind Guardian established themselves as a notable successful band and as pioneers of the power metal movement. In 1996, K\u00FCrsch stopped acting as the band's bass guitarist to focus on vocals. Various session members replaced him, mainly Oliver Holzwarth. However, in 2005, Stauch left the band, disapproving of Blind Guardian's transition into a more complex progressive sound with a heavy use of backing vocals, and was replaced by Ehmke. Most of Blind Guardian's albums were well received by fans and critics alike: Somewhere Far Beyond (1992), Imaginations from the Other Side (1995), and Nightfall in Middle-Earth (1998), are especially seen as influential works. The music is mostly composed by K\u00FCrsch and Olbrich together, and the lyrics, written by K\u00FCrsch, are mostly inspired by the fiction of fantasy authors such as J. R. R. Tolkien, Michael Moorcock, Robert Jordan, Stephen King and George R. R. Martin as well as traditional legends and epics. Over the years a theme has developed which personifies the band members as travelling storytellers, leading fans to refer to the band affectionately as \"The Bards\"."@en ;

The band initially polarized audiences within the hardcore punk scene of California's Inland Empire before finding wider acceptance and, eventually, an international audience. Their strong iconoclasm and emphasis on do-it-yourself values proved influential to the burgeoning indie rock movement. The band's first three independent records were released within an 18-month period. Their debut single was \"Take the Skinheads Bowling\". The group signed to Virgin Records in 1987, released two albums and enjoyed chart success with their 1989 cover of Status Quo's \"Pictures of Matchstick Men\", a number one hit on Billboard Magazine's Modern Rock Tracks. They disbanded the following year due to internal tensions. Lead singer David Lowery formed Cracker, David Immergl\u00FCck joined the Counting Crows, and several other members played in Monks of Doom.

Emerging from the Britpop movement of the mid-1990s, Cast signed to Polydor Records and their debut album All Change (1995) became the highest selling debut album for the label. Further commercial success continued with the albums Mother Nature Calls (1997) and Magic Hour (1999), however a departure in sound on the band's fourth album Beetroot (2001) was met by a poor critical and commercial reaction and led to the band's split two weeks after its release.

	dbo:abstract	"Chicago is an American rock band formed in 1967 in Chicago, Illinois. The self-described \"rock and roll band with horns\" began as a politically charged, sometimes experimental, rock band and later moved to a predominantly softer sound, generating several hit ballads. The group had a steady stream of hits throughout the 1970s and 1980s. Second only to The Beach Boys in Billboard singles and albums chart success among American bands, Chicago is one of the longest-running and most successful rock groups, and one of the world's best-selling groups of all time, having sold more than 100 million records. According to Billboard, Chicago was the leading US singles charting group during the 1970s. They have sold over 40 million units in the US, with 23 gold, 18 platinum, and 8 multi-platinum albums. Over the course of their career they have had five number-one albums and 21 top-ten singles. They will be inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame on April 8, 2016 at Barclays Center in Brooklyn, New York."@en ;

Formed on the third iteration of MTV's Making the Band reality television series in 2005, they were soon signed to Bad Boy Records by Diddy. Danity Kane's self-titled debut studio album was released in 2006 and achieved success in the United States, shipping a million copies domestically, while spawning two singles with top 10 single \"Show Stopper\" and the ballad \"Ride for You.\" Their second studio album, Welcome to the Dollhouse, was released in 2008, following the release of their second top 10 single \"Damaged\". The band became the first female group in Billboard history to debut their first two albums at the top of the charts. Despite initial success, tension in the group led to a meeting with Diddy where, in the October 2008 finale episode of Making the Band 4, he removed O'Day and Woodgett from the group. The three remaining members of the group carried on with previously scheduled promotional events before officially disbanding in early 2009. All group members were ultimately released from their contracts with Bad Boy Records later within the year. In 2013, four of the five group members (O'Day, Bex, Richard and Fimbres) made an official announcement regarding their reunion at the 2013 MTV Video Music Awards; however, on May 16, 2014, Fimbres announced her departure from the group due to wanting to start her family on the first night of their reunion tour in San Francisco, leaving O'Day, Bex, and Richard to continue as a trio. On August 8, 2014, after a fight in the recording studio between members O'Day and Richard, O'Day and Bex announced publicly that Danity Kane had disbanded again."@en ;

It was formed in 1995 as a side project by In Flames' former guitarists Jesper Str\u00F6mblad and Glenn Ljungstr\u00F6m. The former Marduk drummer and vocalist Jocke Gothberg joined later on vocals, as well as Hans Nilsson (ex-Liers in Wait, Diabolique, Crystal Age) on drums. The band released Penetrations from the Lost World in 1997 before splitting up the following year. They reformed in 2000, and later recorded Silent Night Fever and This Is Hell. Tours have been rare due to members' other musical commitments. Musically, they have been described as strictly old-school Swedish death metal in the range of At the Gates, Unleashed and Defleshed. Because of Dimension Zero's inception by In Flames' lead guitarist, Jesper Str\u00F6mblad, their albums have drawn critical comparisons with some of In Flames' earlier work. Their latest album, He Who Shall Not Bleed, was released in 2007. In May 2014, it was announced that the band would reunite for the Gothenburg Sound Festival, which was set to take place in January 2015. In November 2014, a video message from vocalist Jocke on Gothenburg Sound's official Facobook page announced that Dimension Zero had been forced to cancel due to \"family circumstances\" and was replaced by Jesper Str\u00F6mblad's new band The Resistance. The band is slated to instead reunite for Gothenburg Sound 2016."@en ;

They subsequently dropped out of their studies to concentrate further on the band that would ultimately become Dream Theater. Though a number of lineup changes followed, the three original members remained together along with James LaBrie and Jordan Rudess until September 8, 2010 when Portnoy left the band. In October 2010, the band held auditions for a drummer to replace Portnoy. Mike Mangini was announced as the new permanent drummer on April 29, 2011. The band is well known for the technical proficiency of its instrumentalists, who have won many awards from music instruction magazines. Guitarist John Petrucci has been named as the third player on the G3 tour six times, more than any invited players. In 2009 he was named the No. 2 best metal guitarist by Joel McIver in his book The 100 Greatest Metal Guitarists. He was also named as one of the \"Top 10 Fastest Shredders of All Time\" by GuitarOne magazine. Jordan Rudess is considered to be one of the greatest keyboard players of all time by many publications like MusicRadar. Former drummer Mike Portnoy has won 26 awards from Modern Drummer magazine and is also the second youngest person (at the age of 37) to be inducted into the Rock Drummer Hall of Fame. His replacement Mike Mangini has also previously set 5 WFD records. John Myung was voted the greatest bassist of all time in a poll conducted by MusicRadar in August through September 2010. The band was inducted into the Long Island Music Hall of Fame in 2010. The band's highest-selling album is the gold-selling Images and Words (1992), which reached No. 61 on the Billboard 200 chart. Both the 1994 release Awake and their 2002 release Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence also entered the charts at No. 32 and No. 46 respectively and received mostly positive reviews. Metropolis Pt. 2: Scenes from a Memory was ranked number 95 on the October 2006 issue of Guitar World magazine's list of The greatest 100 guitar albums of all time. It is ranked as the 15th Greatest Concept Album (as of March 2003) by Classic Rock Magazine and as the number one all-time progressive album by Rolling Stone (as of July 2012). Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence also led to Dream Theater becoming the initial band reviewed in the music section of Entertainment Weekly during its opening week of release, despite the magazine generally preferring more mainstream music. The band's eleventh studio album, A Dramatic Turn of Events, was released on September 13, 2011. On November 30, 2011, the album's lead single, \"On the Backs of Angels\", was nominated for a Grammy Award in the \"Best Hard Rock/Metal Performance\" category, marking the band's first ever Grammy nomination. Dream Theater's self-titled twelfth studio album was released on September 23, 2013 and earned their second Grammy Award nomination, this time for \u201CBest Metal Performance\u201D, for the album's first single, \"The Enemy Inside\". On April 9, 2013, Images and Words won Loudwire's fan voted March Metal Madness for world's best metal album beating albums by Dio, AC/DC, Judas Priest, Megadeth and Metallica. As of 2011, Dream Theater has sold over 12 million records worldwide."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Eternal is an English R&B girl group formed in 1992 with the line-up consisting of sisters Easther and Vernie Bennett, K\u00E9ll\u00E9 Bryan and Louise Redknapp. The group became an international success, selling around 10 million records worldwide. Redknapp (then Nurding) left for a successful solo career in 1995. Bryan was sacked in 1998 by the other two members, who gave \"a breakdown in professional relations\" as the reason. The remaining duo split in 2000. They were considered the UK's answer to the American girl group En Vogue. Eternal's 1993 debut album Always & Forever peaked at number two on the UK Album Chart and went four-times platinum in the UK. In 1997, they reached number one on the UK Singles Chart with \"I Wanna Be the Only One\", which won them the 1997 Mobo Award for Best Single. They also received seven Brit Award nominations.

dbr:Foo_Fighters	rdf:type	dbo:Band ;
	dbo:abstract	"Foo Fighters is an American rock band, formed in Seattle in 1994. It was founded by Nirvana drummer Dave Grohl as a one-man project following the death of Kurt Cobain and the resulting dissolution of his previous band. The group got its name from the UFOs and various aerial phenomena that were reported by Allied aircraft pilots in World War II, which were known collectively as foo fighters. Prior to the release of Foo Fighters' 1995 debut album Foo Fighters, which featured Grohl as the only official member, Grohl recruited bassist Nate Mendel and drummer William Goldsmith, both formerly of Sunny Day Real Estate, as well as Nirvana touring guitarist Pat Smear to complete the lineup. The band began with performances in Portland, Oregon. Goldsmith quit during the recording of the group's second album, The Colour and the Shape (1997), when most of the drum parts were re-recorded by Grohl himself. Smear's departure followed soon afterward. They were replaced by Taylor Hawkins and Franz Stahl, respectively, although Stahl was fired before the recording of the group's third album, There Is Nothing Left to Lose (1999). The band briefly continued as a trio until Chris Shiflett joined as the band's lead guitarist after the completion of There Is Nothing Left to Lose. The band released its fourth album, One by One, in 2002. The group followed that release with the two-disc In Your Honor (2005), which was split between acoustic songs and heavier material. Foo Fighters released its sixth album, Echoes, Silence, Patience & Grace, in 2007. In 2010, it was confirmed that Smear had officially rejoined the band after having toured with Foo Fighters as an unofficial member since 2005. The band's seventh studio album, Wasting Light, produced by Butch Vig was released in 2011, in which Smear returned as a full member. In November 2014, the band's eighth studio album, Sonic Highways, was released as an accompanying soundtrack to the Grohl-directed 2014 miniseries of the same name. Over the course of the band's career, four of its albums have won Grammy Awards for Best Rock Album. As of 2015 the band's eight albums have sold 12 million copies in the U.S. alone."@en ;

The band originally called themselves Hoover, but later changed their name to Hooverphonic after discovering other groups were already using the Hoover name and to avoid any legal issues with the vacuum cleaner company. On 10 October 2008, Geike Arnaert, the lead singer of the band, announced she would leave the group by the end of the year to pursue her solo career. Arnaert had been working on solo material for a few months. The last concert of Hooverphonic with Geike was on 13 December 2008 in Tele-Club, Ekaterinburg, Russia. It was filmed by the local MTV station and was shown on Russian TV in 2009. On 29 October 2010, Hooverphonic announced their new single on their website. The videoclip showcased fourteen possible singers but only one of them, No\u00E9mie Wolfs, proved to be the real successor of Geike Arnaert. On 4 November 2010, the new singer was announced on De Laatste Show at the VRT, the Flemish public broadcasting organization. On 26 March 2015 Hooverphonic announced that No\u00E9mie Wolfs would be leaving the band \"in mutual agreement\"."@en ;

Initially known in Australia for their pub rock style, they later achieved mainstream success playing new wave and synthpop music and attained Top 10 singles chart success in both Europe and the U.S. The mainstay of both Flowers and Icehouse has been Iva Davies (singer-songwriter, record producer, guitar, bass, keyboards, oboe) supplying additional musicians as required. The name Icehouse, which was adopted in 1981, comes from an old, cold flat Davies lived in and the strange building across the road populated by itinerant people. Davies and Icehouse extended the use of synthesizers particularly the Sequential Circuits Prophet-5 (\"Love in Motion\", 1981), Linn drum machine (\"Hey Little Girl\", 1982) and Fairlight CMI (Razorback trailer, 1983) in Australian popular music. Their best known singles on the Australian charts were \"Great Southern Land\", \"Hey Little Girl\", \"Crazy\", \"Electric Blue\" and \"My Obsession\"; with Top Three albums being Icehouse (1980, as Flowers), Primitive Man (1982) and Man of Colours (1987). Icehouse's iconic status was acknowledged when they were inducted into the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) Hall of Fame on 16 August 2006. ARIA described Icehouse as \"one of the most successful Australian bands of the eighties and nineties... With an uncompromising approach to music production they created songs that ranged from pure pop escapism to edgy, lavish synthesised pieces...\" Icehouse has produced eight Top Ten albums and twenty Top Forty singles in Australia, multiple top ten hits in Europe and North America and album sales of over 28 times Platinum in Australasia alone. As of 2006, Man of Colours was still the highest selling album in Australia by an Australian band."@en ;

The current lineup of the band comprises Flynn, drummer Dave McClain, guitarist Phil Demmel, and bassist Jared MacEachern. Machine Head is one of the pioneering bands in the New Wave of American Heavy Metal. Machine Head was formed by member Robb Flynn, previously part of the bands Forbidden and Vio-lence. Flynn felt musically unfulfilled with Vio-lence and requested to start a side project. When his request was denied, he left the band and formed Machine Head in 1991 with Adam Duce, Logan Mader and Tony Constanza. The band's first album Burn My Eyes, was a big success in Europe where it garnered attention on MTV's Headbangers Ball. In America (with HBB taken off the air during the grunge movement) Machine Head would not have success until later albums. The band nearly disbanded in 2002 after negotiating off its label Roadrunner Records, when controversy surrounding Machine Head's fourth album Supercharger (released 3 weeks after September 11, 2001) resulted in their songs and music video for the song \"Crashing Around You\" (which featured burning buildings) being pulled from all media outlets. The band re-signed with Roadrunner soon after and has released four albums since, 2003's Through the Ashes of Empires, 2007's The Blackening (which earned Machine Head its first Grammy Award nomination) and 2011's Unto the Locust. Their most recent album, Bloodstone & Diamonds, was released in 2014. Machine Head have sold over 3 million records worldwide."@en ;

They are often colloquially known as \"The Manics.\" After the release of their first single, \"Suicide Alley\", Richey Edwards joined the band as co-lyricist and rhythm guitarist. The band proclaimed their debut album Generation Terrorists would be the \"greatest rock album ever\" and hoped to sell sixteen million copies around the world, \"from Bangkok to Senegal\", after which they would split up. Despite the album's failure to meet this level of success, the band carried on with their career. The group later became a trio when Edwards disappeared on 1 February 1995. Bradfield, Moore and Wire went on to gain critical and commercial success. The band have released twelve albums and three compilations, Forever Delayed, Lipstick Traces (A Secret History of Manic Street Preachers) and National Treasures \u2013 The Complete Singles. Their early combination of androgynous glam imagery, critical social lyrics about \"culture, alienation, boredom and despair\" and a furious rock sound gained them a loyal following over the years and assured them a cult status. The band's later albums retained a leftist politicisation and intellectual lyrical style while adopting a broader alternative rock sound. To date, they have sold more than 10 million albums worldwide. Over their career the Manics have headlined several festivals including Glastonbury, T in the Park, V Festival and Reading. They have won eleven NME Awards, eight Q Awards and four BRIT Awards. The Manics were also nominated for the Mercury Prize in 1996 and 1999, and have had one nomination for the MTV Europe Music Awards. The group has reached number 1 in the UK charts three times: in 1998 with the album This Is My Truth Tell Me Yours, and the single \"If You Tolerate This Your Children Will Be Next\" and again in 2000 with the single \"The Masses Against the Classes\"."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Oasis were an English rock band formed in Manchester in 1991. Developed from an earlier group, the Rain, the band originally consisted of Liam Gallagher (vocals and tambourine), Paul \"Bonehead\" Arthurs (guitar), Paul \"Guigsy\" McGuigan (bass guitar), and Tony McCarroll (drums, percussion). They were later joined by Liam's older brother Noel Gallagher (lead guitar and vocals) as a fifth member, becoming the band's settled line-up until April 1995. Oasis signed to independent record label Creation Records in 1993 and released their record-setting debut album Definitely Maybe (1994). The following year the band recorded (What's the Story) Morning Glory? (1995) with their new and former Starclub drummer Alan White in the midst of a rivalry with Britpop peers Blur in the charts. The Gallagher brothers were featured regularly in tabloid newspapers for their sibling disputes and wild lifestyles. In 1997 Oasis released their third album, Be Here Now (1997), and although it became the fastest-selling album in UK chart history, the album's popularity tapered off quickly, not before selling 8 million copies. McGuigan and Arthurs left Oasis in 1999 as the band went on to record and release Standing on the Shoulder of Giants (2000). After their departures, they were replaced by former Heavy Stereo guitarist/frontman Gem Archer and former Hurricane No. 1 guitarist/frontman Andy Bell who joined the group for the tour in support of Standing on the Shoulder of Giants, which had moderate success. Their fifth studio album Heathen Chemistry (2002) saw Noel Gallagher's releasing strict creative control in the band's output with all members contributing songs, which led to more relaxed recording sessions. In 2004 the band were joined by The Who's drummer Zak Starkey, replacing Alan White, and found renewed success and popularity with Don't Believe the Truth (2005). Following the recording of the band's seventh album Dig Out Your Soul (2008), Starkey left and was replaced by Chris Sharrock on Oasis' last tour as a collective band. During the tour the brothers' increasingly deteriorating relationship ultimately led to Noel Gallagher announcing in August 2009 that he would be leaving the band after a backstage altercation with Liam before a festival appearance. The band, comprising the remaining members of Oasis and led by Liam Gallagher, decided to continue working together under the name Beady Eye until breaking up in 2014, while Noel went on to form his solo project Noel Gallagher's High Flying Birds. Oasis have had eight UK number-one singles and eight UK number-one albums, and won fifteen NME Awards, nine Q Awards, four MTV Europe Music Awards and six Brit Awards, including one in 2007 for Outstanding Contribution to Music and one for the Best Album of the Last 30 Years as voted by BBC Radio 2 listeners; they have been nominated for three Grammy Awards. By 2009, the band had sold an estimated 70 million records worldwide. The band were listed in the Guinness World Records book in 2010 for \"Longest Top 10 UK Chart Run by a Group\" after an unprecedented run of 22 top 10 hits in the UK.

dbr:Orchestral_Manoeuvres_in_the_Dark	rdf:type	dbo:Band ;
	dbo:abstract	"Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark (OMD) are an English new wave/synthpop group formed in 1978, whose founding members, Andy McCluskey (vocals, bass guitar) and Paul Humphreys (keyboards, vocals), are originally from the Wirral Peninsula, Merseyside, England. While steadily eschewing pop star status, the band cultivated a fanbase in the United Kingdom from 1978\u20131980. They gained popularity throughout Europe with the 1980 single \"Enola Gay\", and achieved broader recognition via album Architecture & Morality (1981) and its singles. OMD garnered acclaim for their experimental recordings, which are noted for their intellectual depth. Although retrospectively lauded, the challenging Dazzle Ships (1983) eroded European consumer interest during the mid 1980s; Junk Culture (1984) marked a shift toward more pop-oriented songwriting. Concurrently, OMD reached their peak in the United States and had a major hit with 1986's \"If You Leave\", written for the film Pretty in Pink. Humphreys departed in 1989 with Martin Cooper (various instruments) and Malcolm Holmes (drums) to form The Listening Pool, leaving McCluskey to lead the outfit; Sugar Tax (1991) and its initial singles were sizeable hits in Europe. By the mid 1990s, however, synthpop had become unfashionable amid the guitar oriented musical climate, and McCluskey dissolved the band in 1996, months after their last successful single, \"Walking on the Milky Way\". He founded pop group Atomic Kitten in 1998. The band reformed in 2006 and began releasing new material in 2009. Their European fanbase remained steadfast: History of Modern (2010) became the group's biggest hit on the German chart; English Electric (2013) their largest in the UK since Sugar Tax. The group have sold over 40 million records. With a within popular music, OMD have influenced many modern acts. Their songs have been covered or remixed by numerous artists, and the group are the subject of two tribute albums. Regarding the group's impact on synthpop, The Scotsman wrote that \"Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark were its Beatles\"; McCluskey and Humphreys have been labelled by numerous critics as the genre's counterpart of Lennon\u2013McCartney."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Pavement was an American indie rock band that formed in Stockton, California in 1989. The group mainly consisted of Stephen Malkmus (vocals and guitar), Scott Kannberg (guitar and vocals), Mark Ibold (bass), Steve West (drums) and Bob Nastanovich (percussion and vocals). Initially conceived as a recording project, the band at first avoided press or live performances, while attracting considerable underground attention with their early releases. Gradually evolving into a more polished band, Pavement recorded five full-length albums and nine EPs over the course of their decade-long career, though they disbanded with some acrimony in 1999 as the members moved on to other projects. In 2010, they undertook a well-received reunion tour. Though only briefly brushing the mainstream with the single \"Cut Your Hair\" in 1994, Pavement was a successful indie rock band. Rather than signing with a major label as many of their 1980s forebears had done, they remained signed to independent labels throughout their career and have often been described as one of the most influential bands to emerge from the American underground in the '90s. Some prominent music critics, such as Robert Christgau and Stephen Thomas Erlewine, went so far as to call them the best band of the 1990s. In their career, they also achieved a significant cult following."@en ;

The name Pentangle was chosen to represent the five members of the band, and is also the device on Sir Gawain's shield in the Middle English poem Sir Gawain and the Green Knight which held a fascination for Renbourn. In 2007, the original members of the band were reunited to receive a Lifetime Achievement award at the BBC Radio 2 Folk Awards and to record a short concert that was broadcast on BBC radio.

	dbo:abstract	"Porcupine Tree are an English rock band formed by musician Steven Wilson in 1987. The band began essentially as a solo project for Wilson, who created all of the band's music. However, by 1993, Wilson desired to work in a band environment, and so brought on frequent collaborators Richard Barbieri on keyboards, Colin Edwin on bass and Chris Maitland on drums as permanent band members. With Wilson still in charge of guitar and lead vocals, this would remain the lineup until 2001, when the band recruited Gavin Harrison to replace Maitland on drums. Porcupine Tree's early sound evokes a style of psychedelic rock comparable to that of progressive rock band Pink Floyd. Upon signing with Kscope record label in the late 1990s, the band approached a more mainstream alternative rock sound. By the early 2000s, the band signed to a major record label and shifted their sound again, this time in a more progressive metal direction. After the release and tour in support of their tenth studio album, The Incident, the band became inactive as Wilson began to focus on his solo career. While not formally broken up, they also have no particular reformation plans beyond \"someday\", with members all working on separate projects, and Wilson committing himself to his solo work through most of 2015."@en ;

Despite their pop-oriented nature, the trio maintains a distinctly underground garage rock sound rooted in edgy instrumentation and D.I.Y. aesthetics, which over the course of their long career has earned them a solid, worldwide cult following and made avid fans out of seminal '90s alternative rock bands such as Sonic Youth, Nirvana, and Redd Kross.

	dbo:abstract	"Sodom is a German thrash metal band from Gelsenkirchen, formed in 1981. Along with Kreator, Destruction and Tankard, Sodom is considered one of the \"The Big Teutonic Four\" of Teutonic thrash metal. While three of those bands (except Tankard) created a sound that would influence death metal and black metal, Sodom's early music style would greatly influence many late-1980s and early-1990s black metal bands more than others. To date, Sodom has released fourteen studio albums, three live albums, two compilation albums and six EPs. They achieved their first commercial success with their third studio album Agent Orange (1989), which was the first thrash metal album to enter the German album charts, where it reached number 36. Sodom remains one of the best-selling thrash metal acts of all time, having sold over one million records."@en ;

dbr:Suicidal_Tendencies	rdf:type	dbo:Band ;
	dbo:abstract	"Suicidal Tendencies (also known as S.T. or simply Suicidal) is an American crossover thrash band founded in 1981 in Venice, California by vocalist Mike Muir, who is the only remaining original member of the band. The band is often credited (along with D.R.I.) as one of \"the fathers of crossover thrash\". To date, Suicidal Tendencies have released nine studio albums, one EP, four split albums including the rare Welcome to Venice, six compilation albums (one of which is a \"double-EP\", while the other is a re-recording of their debut album), and two long-form videos. Suicidal Tendencies rose to fame with their 1983 self-titled debut album, which spawned the single \"Institutionalized\", and was one of the first hardcore punk videos to receive substantial airplay on MTV. Suicidal Tendencies' next release was on their own label, Suicidal Records, where they contributed one song, \"Look Up...(The Boys Are Back)\", on the 1985 split Welcome to Venice. After releasing their second album Join the Army (1987), Suicidal Tendencies were signed to Epic Records in 1988, and continued their success with their next three albums, How Will I Laugh Tomorrow When I Can't Even Smile Today (1988), Controlled by Hatred/Feel Like Shit...D\u00E9j\u00E0 Vu (1989) and Lights...Camera...Revolution! (1990); the latter of the two were certified Gold by the RIAA. Their 1992 follow-up album The Art of Rebellion was also very successful, and included two of their biggest hits \"Nobody Hears\" and \"I'll Hate You Better\". After releasing two more studio albums (Still Cyco After All These Years and Suicidal for Life), the band broke up and severed ties from Sony and Epic in 1995. However, they reunited a year later and have continued to perform and record since then. After over a decade of work and many lineup changes, Suicidal Tendencies released their eleventh studio album with all-new material, 13, in 2013. The band has been in talks of releasing a follow-up album in the future."@en ;

Over the years, they have been divided into smaller groups, simultaneously targeting different music industries and audiences. Largely due to Super Junior's success as entertainers, other Korean entertainment managements began to train their music groups in other areas of entertainment, such as acting and hosting. Super Junior is the best-selling K-pop artist for four years in a row. Super Junior have earned thirteen music awards from the Mnet Asian Music Awards, sixteen from the Golden Disk Awards, and are the second singing group to win Favorite Artist Korea at the 2008 MTV Asia Awards after jtL in 2003.

dbr:Taking_Back_Sunday	rdf:type	dbo:Band ;
	dbo:abstract	"Taking Back Sunday is an American rock band from Long Island, New York. The band was formed by guitarist Eddie Reyes in 1999. The band's members are Adam Lazzara (lead vocals), John Nolan (guitar, vocals), Eddie Reyes (guitar), Shaun Cooper (bass guitar) and Mark O'Connell (drums). The band has released three studio albums with various past members Fred Mascherino (former lead guitarist and back-up vocalist), Matthew Rubano (former bassist), and Matthew Fazzi (former lead guitarist and back-up vocalist). The original Tell All Your Friends line-up reunited in 2010 and has released two studio albums: Taking Back Sunday and their most recent album Happiness Is. Louder Now (2006) was the band's breakout mainstream album, notably because of the popularity of its lead single \"MakeDamnSure.\" The album has sold over 900,000 copies and peaked at No. 2 on the United States Billboard 200, surpassing the band's previous Billboard 200 peak in 2004 at No. 3 with Where You Want to Be. Before the release of their first studio album Tell All Your Friends (2002), they released Taking Back Sunday's EP in 2001, when the band featured former lead vocalist Antonio Longo. At that time, the EP received very little attention, eventually resulting in the band seeking a new lead singer, Adam Lazzara. Lazzara had at first joined the band as its guitarist, left a few months after it formed, then replaced original bassist Jesse Lacey (now of Brand New) during the EP's recording sessions. John Nolan and Shaun Cooper left the band in 2003 only to rejoin in 2010, in time for the band's release of their eponymous album Taking Back Sunday on June 28, 2011. The album was produced by Eric Valentine and released through Warner Bros. Records. In 2014, the band released their sixth studio album Happiness Is to positive reviews. The album reached number 10 on the Billboard US charts."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"The Black Mages was a Japanese instrumental rock/hard rock band formed in 2002 by Nobuo Uematsu, Kenichiro Fukui and Tsuyoshi Sekito - three composers for Square Enix. The band arranged Uematsu's Final Fantasy video game series-based compositions in a hard rock style often similar to progressive metal, achieved with the additional use of synthesizers. Since its inception, the band had expanded to six members with the addition of Keiji Kawamori, Michio Okamiya and Arata Hanyuda. On August 7, 2010, Nobuo Uematsu announced the band had disbanded, but he would continue to perform rock arrangements of his music as a part of another band, the Earthbound Papas. The band has released three studio albums. Their first was released eponymously as The Black Mages in 2003, and contained arrangements of Final Fantasy battle themes. The second album, The Black Mages II: The Skies Above, was released in 2004 and featured additional pieces besides battle themes including the group's first original song, \"Blue Blast ~Winning the Rainbow\", which was created for Japanese K-1 fighter Takehiro Murahama. The third album, The Black Mages III: Darkness and Starlight, was released on March 19, 2008. Music from the group has also appeared in other albums, including one track in Dark Chronicle Premium Arrange, an album of arranged music from the video game Dark Chronicle, a piece in the animated film Final Fantasy VII Advent Children and its corresponding soundtrack album, and one track on Final Fantasy III Original Soundtrack, the soundtrack album for the Nintendo DS version of Final Fantasy III. The Black Mages did not tour as a band, but performed several concerts to promote their album releases. For their first album they performed in Shibuya and Kanagawa, Japan in 2003 and later released a live video of the first concert on DVD exclusively to Uematsu fanclub members. They repeated this for the release of their second album, performing in Kawasaki and Osaka, Japan in 2005 and similarly released on DVD to fanclub members. The third album saw a performance in Yokohama, Japan in 2008; a DVD of the show was released commercially on March 25, 2009. In addition to these concerts, The Black Mages made live appearances at two Final Fantasy concerts, More Friends: Music from Final Fantasy and Voices - Music from Final Fantasy, as well as another video game music event, Extra: Hyper Game Music Event 2007."@en ;

dbr:The_Chieftains	rdf:type	dbo:Band ;
	dbo:abstract	"The Chieftains are a traditional Irish band formed in Dublin in November 1962, by Paddy Moloney, Sean Potts and Michael Tubridy. The band had their first rehearsals at Moloney's house, with Tubridy, Martin Fay and David Fallon. Their sound, which is almost entirely instrumental and largely built around uilleann pipes, has become synonymous with traditional Irish music and they are regarded as having helped popularise Irish music across the world. Paddy Moloney came out of Ceolt\u00F3ir\u00ED Chualann, a group of musicians who specialised in instrumentals, and sought to form a new band. The group remained only semi-professional up until the 1970s and by then had achieved great success in Ireland and the United Kingdom. In 1973, their popularity began to spread to the United States when their previous albums were released there by Island Records. They received further acclaim when they worked on the Academy Award-winning soundtrack to Stanley Kubrick's 1975 film Barry Lyndon, which triggered their transition to the mainstream in the US. The group continued to release successful records throughout the 1970s and 1980s, and their work with Van Morrison in 1988 resulted in the critically acclaimed album Irish Heartbeat. They went on to collaborate with many other well-known musicians and singers; among them Luciano Pavarotti, the Rolling Stones, Madonna, Sin\u00E9ad O'Connor and Roger Daltrey. The band have won six Grammys during their career and they were given a Lifetime Achievement Award at the prestigious BBC Radio 2 Folk Awards in 2002. Some music experts have credited The Chieftains with bringing traditional Irish music to a worldwide audience, so much so that the Irish government awarded them the honorary title of 'Ireland's Musical Ambassadors' in 1989. In 2012, they celebrated their 50th anniversary with the release of their most recent record Voice of Ages."@en ;

Originally, they used the name Crown of Thorns but were forced to change their name due to an American band already using that name. Their music and lyrics are inspired by death, antireligious themes (mostly targeting Christianity) and rebellion. They are known to fuse melodic death metal with aggressive old-school death metal tendencies and considerable thrash metal influences, reminiscent of bands such as Possessed and old Sepultura. The Crown disbanded in 2004. After that, Lindstrand went on to form One Man Army and the Undead Quartet.[citation needed] Tervonen formed Angel Blake, named after a song by Danzig. He now focuses on his new project Lady Mourning together with his wife and vocalist Elina Tervonen, keyboardist Andreas Tiberto and bassist Alexander Bringsoniou, both in Akribi. Sunesson is in a band called Engel. Olsfelt is also in a band called Stolen Policecar. The band was reformed in December 2009 with Jonas St\u00E5lhammar of God Macabre as the new vocalist. On June 30, 2010, it was reported that The Crown signed a worldwide deal with Century Media Records and the band's eighth studio album, Doomsday King, was released in September 2010. On September 14, 2014, The Crown will celebrate their 25th anniversary with the release of a new studio album, Death Is Not Dead on January 12, 2015.

dbr:The_Flaming_Lips	rdf:type	dbo:Band ;
	dbo:abstract	"The Flaming Lips is an American rock band formed in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, in 1983. Instrumentally, their sound contains lush, multi-layered, psychedelic rock arrangements, but lyrically their compositions show elements of space rock, including unusual song and album titles\u2014such as \"What Is the Light? (An Untested Hypothesis Suggesting That the Chemical [In Our Brains] by Which We Are Able to Experience the Sensation of Being in Love Is the Same Chemical That Caused the \"Big Bang\" That Was the Birth of the Accelerating Universe)\". They are also acclaimed for their elaborate live shows, which feature costumes, balloons, puppets, video projections, complex stage light configurations, giant hands, large amounts of confetti, and frontman Wayne Coyne's signature man-sized plastic bubble, in which he traverses the audience. In 2002, Q magazine named the Flaming Lips one of the \"50 Bands to See Before You Die.\" The band is best known for its associations with 1960s and 1970s psychedelic subculture, with elements of this culture permeating the group's instrumentation, effects, and composition. Coyne's lyrics, in particular, both reference and embody the fascination with the science fiction and space opera genres of fiction that were popular during the golden age of psychedelic subculture. His lyrical style tends to use the imagery and plot conventions of space opera to frame more abstract themes about the unfolding cycles of romantic love, highlighting its vulnerability while delving into its metaphysical implications. The group recorded several albums and EPs on an indie label, Restless, in the 1980s and early 1990s. After signing to Warner Brothers, they scored a hit in 1993 with \"She Don't Use Jelly\". Although it has been their only hit single in the U.S., the band has maintained critical respect and, to a lesser extent, commercial viability through albums such as 1999's The Soft Bulletin (which was NME magazine's Album of the Year) and 2002's Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots. They have had more hit singles in the UK and Europe than in the U.S. In February 2007, they were nominated for a 2007 BRIT Award in the \"Best International Act\" category. By 2007, the group garnered three Grammy Awards, including two for Best Rock Instrumental Performance."@en ;

After the departure of Badger in late 1986, the band signed to Go! Discs in 1987 and commenced recording of their debut album. Following the release of singles \"Way Out\" (1987), \"There She Goes\" (1988) and \"Timeless Melody\" (1990) and having aborted several recording sessions with different producers, the band released their debut album The La's in 1990 to critical acclaim and modest commercial success. John Power left The La's to form Cast and the group entered a prolonged hiatus in 1992 which lasted almost two decades. The group later reformed briefly in the mid-1990s, 2005 and 2011.

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Trio_(band)>	rdf:type	dbo:Band ;
	dbo:abstract	"Trio was a German band, formed in the small German town of Gro\u00DFenkneten in 1980. The band is most noted for the song \"Da da da, ich lieb dich nicht, du liebst mich nicht, aha aha aha\" (usually simply \"Da Da Da\") which was a hit in 30 countries worldwide.[citation needed] Trio was part of the Neue Deutsche Welle (or NDW); however, the band preferred the name \"Neue Deutsche Fr\u00F6hlichkeit\", which means \"New German Cheerfulness\", to describe their music. At that time, as now, popular songs were based on extremely simple structures that were ornately produced. Trio's main principle was to remove almost all the ornamentation and polish from their songs, and to use the simplest practical structures (most of their songs were three-chord songs). For this reason, many of their songs are restricted to drums, guitar, vocals, and just one or maybe two other instruments, if any at all. Bass was used very infrequently until their later songs, and live shows often saw Remmler playing some simple pre-programmed rhythms and melodies on his small Casio VL-1 keyboard while Behrens played his drums with one hand and ate an apple with the other. The band produced a number of albums. There are many versions of Bye Bye (marked with different advertisements on the cover); versions in North America are called TRIO and Error and feature no advertisements. The 1997 CD of TRIO and Error was also released as Da Da Da in the United States, in response to the 1997 US Volkswagen commercial that featured the song \"Da Da Da I Don't Love You You Don't Love Me Aha Aha Aha\", often contracted to simply \"Da Da Da\". The re-release had some changes: two songs were added and the album was digitally remastered.In their time, Trio had some popularity in Germany, UK, Canada, and the US. The German version of \"Da Da Da\" was a No. 2 hit on the charts (April 1982). Their most notable songs, other than \"Da Da Da\", are probably \"Broken Hearts for You and Me\", \"Boom Boom\", \"Hearts are Trump\" and \"Anna Letmein Letmeout\". All of these songs except the first have a corresponding German version, which sometimes differs considerably, and these were also released in the English-speaking world. \"Da Da Da\" hit No. 2 on the UK Singles Chart in July 1982, and No. 3 in Canada in December 1982. They had another three top ten hits in Germany until the end of 1983, then disbanded the following year. Every member launched a solo career, with only Remmler managing to be somewhat successful. They produced a movie called Drei gegen Drei, meaning \"Three Against Three\". In the movie, three people (played by Trio) kill doubles of themselves as part of a twisted scam to gain riches. However, the movie flopped miserably; even avid Trio fan Matthias Klein said, \"[the members of] Trio are not actors\". The corresponding soundtrack is the album Whats the Password; however, drummer Peter Behrens did not perform on any of the songs, despite appearing on the album's cover. He left the band due to dissatisfaction with Kralle and Remmler over financial matters, leading to the complete breakup of Trio in 1985."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Yazoo (known as Yaz in North America for legal reasons with Yazoo Records) were a British synthpop duo from Basildon, Essex, England, consisting of former Depeche Mode member Vince Clarke (keyboards) and Alison Moyet (vocals). Formed in late 1981 after Clarke responded to an advertisement Moyet placed in a UK music magazine, over the next 18 months the duo made two critically acclaimed albums, Upstairs at Eric's and You and Me Both, blending Clarke's synthesizer melodies with Moyet's blues- and soul-influenced vocals. Yazoo enjoyed worldwide success, particularly in their home country where three of their four singles reached the top three of the UK Singles Chart and both their albums made the top two of the albums chart. In North America they are best known for the song \"Situation\", originally only a B-side in the UK but which was a club and airplay hit in the US and Canada before being released as the band's debut single in North America. Despite their success, the duo split acrimoniously in the spring of 1983 due to a combination of Clarke's reluctance to make more records under the Yazoo name, a clash of personalities, and a lack of communication between the pair. Clarke went on to form Erasure, another successful and longer-lasting synthpop duo, while Moyet embarked on a highly successful solo career. Although their musical career was short, Yazoo's combination of electronic instrumentation and soulful female vocals has been cited as an influence on the house music scene that emerged in the mid-1980s, as well as bands such as LCD Soundsystem (who name-checked them on their debut single \"Losing My Edge\"), Hercules and Love Affair (whose leader Andy Butler has said that \"Situation\" was his biggest musical inspiration as a child), La Roux, Shiny Toy Guns and Blaqk Audio. In 2008, 25 years after splitting up, Clarke and Moyet reconciled and reformed Yazoo to play a successful tour of the UK, Europe and North America in support of the reissue of Yazoo's two studio albums and a box set of their material. The pair briefly reunited again in May 2011 to play three Yazoo songs at a music festival organised by their record label."@en ;

The band subsequently founded BYO (Better Youth Organization), which served both as their record label and as a statement of their attitude toward the young people involved in the punk subculture, which was generally sympathetic and arguably less sensationalistic than the view usually presented in the media. Many later punk bands cite Youth Brigade as an influence, including The Nation of Ulysses and The Briefs. Youth Brigade has released five studio albums (counting one released as The Brigade), of which the last was released in 1996. Almost each album was recorded with the original lineup of the Stern brothers (Mark, Adam and Shawn); bassist Bob Gnarly replaced Adam in 1985 during the recording of The Dividing Line, which was released as The Brigade. Adam returned in 1991 (when the band reunited) and contributed to the band's 1992 EP Come Again and their next two albums (Happy Hour and To Sell the Truth) before leaving once again in 2007.

The band originally comprised songwriting team Tim Gane (guitar/keyboards) and L\u00E6titia Sadier (vocals/keyboards/guitar), both of whom remained at the helm across many lineup changes. Other long-time members include Mary Hansen (backing vocals/keyboards/guitar), who played with the group from 1992 until her accidental death in 2002, and Andy Ramsay (drums), who joined in 1993, and who is still in the official line-up. Called \"one of the most fiercely independent and original groups of the Nineties\", Stereolab were one of the first bands to be termed \"post-rock\". Their primary musical influence was 1970s krautrock, which they combined with lounge, 1960s pop, and experimental pop music. They were noted for their heavy use of vintage electronic keyboards, and their sound often overlays a repetitive \"motorik\" beat with female vocals sung in English or French. Stereolab often incorporates socio-political themes into their lyrics. Some critics say the group's lyrics carry a strong Marxist message, and both Gane and Sadier admit to being influenced by the Surrealist and Situationist cultural and political movements. Gane is skeptical of labels such as \"Marxist pop\", and defends the band against accusations of \"sloganeering\". Although many of the band's albums have been underground hits, they never found larger commercial success. The band were released from their recording contract with Warner Bros. Records when Warner's imprint Elektra Records folded. The release was reportedly due to poor record sales, and since then Stereolab's self-owned label, Duophonic Records, has signed a distribution deal with Too Pure. Duophonic holds the copyrights to the band's recordings, and on this label the band has released many limited-edition records. In 2009, Stereolab announced via their website that they were going on indefinite hiatus."@en ;

Frontman Boots Riley's revolutionarily-charged lyrics rank The Coup as a renowned political hip hop band aligned to radical music groups such as The Clash, Dead Prez and Rage Against the Machine. The Coup's music is driven by aggressive and danceable bass-driven backbeats overlaid by critical, hopeful, and witty lyrics, often with a bent towards the literary. The Coup's songs critique, observe, and lampoon capitalism, American politics, patriarchal exploitation, police brutality, marijuana addiction, romance, working at fast food places, and disparities among race and class."@en ;

dbr:The_Quarrymen	rdf:type	dbo:Band ;
	dbo:abstract	"The Quarrymen (also written as \"the Quarry Men\") are a British skiffle/rock and roll group, formed by John Lennon in Liverpool in 1956, which eventually evolved into the Beatles in 1960. Originally consisting of Lennon and several schoolfriends, the Quarrymen took their name from a line in the school song of Quarry Bank High School, which they attended. Lennon's mother, Julia Lennon, taught her son to play the banjo and then showed Lennon and Eric Griffiths how to tune their guitars in a similar way to the banjo, and taught them simple chords and songs. Lennon started a skiffle group that was very briefly called the Blackjacks, but changed the name before any public performances. Some accounts credit Lennon with choosing the new name; other accounts credit his close friend Pete Shotton with suggesting the name. The Quarrymen played at parties, school dances, cinemas and amateur skiffle contests before Paul McCartney joined the band in October 1957. George Harrison joined the band in early 1958 at McCartney's recommendation, though Lennon initially resisted because he felt Harrison (still 14 when he was first introduced to Lennon) to be too young. Both McCartney and Harrison attended the Liverpool Institute. The group made an amateur recording of themselves in 1958, performing Buddy Holly's \"That'll Be the Day\" and \"In Spite of All the Danger\", a song written by McCartney and Harrison. The group moved away from skiffle and towards rock and roll, causing several of the original members to leave. This left only a trio of Lennon, McCartney, and Harrison, who performed under several other names, including Johnny and the Moondogs and Japage 3 before returning to the Quarrymen name in 1959. In 1960, the group changed its name to the Beatles, and went on to have an extremely successful recording career. In 1997 the four surviving original members of the Quarrymen reunited to perform at the 40th anniversary celebrations of the garden fete performance at which Lennon and McCartney met for the first time. The band decided to continue playing, and since 1998 have performed in many countries throughout the world, releasing four albums. As of 2016, three original members are still actively performing as the Quarrymen."@en ;

The band's name is a reference to the way calibration tones were recorded on the \"tail\" of reel-to-reel tape. After the breakup of Bauhaus in 1983, they were joined by drummer Kevin Haskins. Their music was described by one critic as \"doom-and-dance-pop.\" The band disbanded in 1984 shortly before Ash and Haskins went on to form Love and Rockets. In concert, the band sported all white.[citation needed] Their track \"Go!\" was one of the sample sources for Moby's \"Go\".

dbr:Van_Halen	rdf:type	dbo:Band ;
	dbo:abstract	"Van Halen is an American rock band formed in Pasadena, California, in 1972. From 1974 until 1985, the band comprised guitarist Eddie Van Halen, vocalist David Lee Roth, drummer Alex Van Halen, and bassist Michael Anthony. The band went on to become major stars, and by the early 1980s they were one of the most successful rock acts of the time. 1984 was their most successful album. The lead single, \"Jump\", became an international hit and their only single to reach number one on the Billboard Hot 100. The following singles, \"Panama\" and \"I'll Wait\", both hit number 13 on the U.S. charts. The album went on to sell over 12 million copies in the U.S. alone. In 1985, the band replaced lead singer David Lee Roth with ex-Montrose lead vocalist Sammy Hagar. With Hagar, the group would release four U.S. number-one albums over the course of 11 years. Hagar left the band in 1996 shortly before the release of the band's first greatest hits collection, Best Of \u2013 Volume I. Former Extreme frontman Gary Cherone was quickly recruited as lead singer to replace Hagar, and Van Halen III was released in 1998. Cherone left the band in frustration in 1999 after the tour due to the poor commercial performance of the album. Van Halen went on hiatus until 2003 when they reunited with Hagar for a worldwide tour. The reunited band released a second greatest hits collection the following year, The Best of Both Worlds. Like Volume I before it, The Best of Both Worlds included material from both the Roth and Hagar eras but omitted any Cherone era tracks. The album featured three brand new tracks recorded by the reunited band, two of which were released as singles. Hagar again left Van Halen in 2005, and in 2006 Roth returned as lead vocalist for their highest-grossing tour, and one of the highest-grossing tours of that year. Anthony was not invited to participate in the tour and was essentially fired from the band, replaced by Wolfgang Van Halen, Eddie's son. In 2012, the band released the commercially and critically successful, A Different Kind of Truth, with Roth as lead vocalist. According to the RIAA, Van Halen is the 19th-best-selling band/artist in United States history, selling 56 million albums in the U.S. They were also revealed at number 4 on the Billboard's top moneymakers list in 2013. Van Halen is one of only five rock bands that have had two studio albums sell more than 10 million copies in the U.S. Additionally, Van Halen charted the most number-one hits in the history of Billboard's Mainstream Rock chart and they are one of the world's best-selling bands of all time, having sold more than 80 million records. Van Halen achieved worldwide fame for their many popular songs and larger-than-life stage performances; they also became known for the drama surrounding the departures of former members. Controversy surrounded the band following the exits of Roth, Hagar, and Anthony; this controversy often included numerous conflicting press statements between the former members and the band. In 2007, Van Halen was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. VH1 ranked them 7th on their list of the top 100 hard rock artists of all time."@en ;

Since their formation, they became Pakistan's first and most commercially successful as well as critically acclaimed act. The band's popular lineup consisted of keyboardist Rohail Hyatt, bassist Shahzad Hasan, guitarist Nusrat Hussain and vocalist Junaid Jamshed. Rooted in Rawalpindi with some influence from Western music during the conservative regime of President Zia-ul-Haq, the Vital Signs utilizes several genres, ranging from pop music to rock, and often incorporating classical and other elements in innovative ways. In the early 1990s, they came to be perceived by many Pakistani fans and country's cultural observers as a \"promising new era of cultural revival\". Their enormous popularity significantly opened a new wave of music and a modern chapter in the history of Pakistan. The band built its reputation playing in university campuses and underground rock music concerts held in different parts of the country, before being noticed by PTV performing art section director Shoaib Mansoor. The band initially gained national prominence and popularity from their music video of their single \"Dil Dil Pakistan\" first aired on PTV. Written by Shaoib Mansoor, the song became a big commercial hit and critically acclaimed in the public; it was voted, in an unscientific poll as the third most popular song of all time by BBC World. By the early 1990s, the band members had become public celebrities and international stars in the midst of the 1990s. From the 1980s to the 1990s, they produced many of their highly successful and critically praised albums, what many cultural critics consider their finest material including the innovative and widely influential albums, Vital Signs-1 (1989), Vital Sign-2 (1991), Aitebar (1993) and Hum Tum (1995). The success of their second album marked the international prominence of the band, first traveling to the United States to perform, becoming the first Pakistani music act to go abroad on a tour. After the disintegrating and fading of the band in 1998, they each enjoyed successful musical careers. Leading singer Junaid Jamshed went on to pursue a career as a solo singer, Shahzad Hasan concentrated on his work as a music producer and Rohail Hyatt formed a production company. The Vital Signs is considered one of the most successful bands in Pakistan, having influenced many of the pop, rock, and heavy metal musical groups originating from Pakistan."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Ancient is a Norwegian black metal band from Bergen, formed in 1992. The band released six full-length albums released by Metal Blade Records to date and a variety of mini-albums, EPs and special releases. Ancient used to have the classic raw black metal sound, similar to Darkthrone's works. Beginning with The Cainian Chronicle, they moved towards a more Nordic/atmospheric black metal sound, akin to Emperor and a cleaner production. After a period of turmoil concerning their line-up, they went on to add gothic-style instruments such as violins, a female vocalist, and synthesizers to their music. To this day Ancient can be considered as one of the original Norwegian black metal bands that were part of the now famous scene of the early nineties. They were one of the very first Norwegian black metal bands to sign for a semi-major label (Metal Blade Records). There is no evidence of any involvement of Ancient with the infamous occurrences of the Norwegian black metal scene, although they were part of the same scene. Ancient can be considered as a historical black metal act by all standards, whose path took a different course upon their relocation around the world and subsequent exit from the local Norwegian scene."@en ;

GBH were early pioneers of English street punk, often nicknamed \"UK82\", along with Discharge, Broken Bones, The Exploited and The Varukers. They have gone on to influence several punk rock musicians. The name GBH was inspired by then-bassist Sean McCarthy's trial for grievous bodily harm, though some fans also believe it is an acronym for \"Great Britain Hardcore\" and \"Great Big Hair\". Though the core line up of Colin, Ross and Jock has stayed the same throughout their history the drum stool has been occupied by a number of incumbents following Wilf's departure after the Midnight Madness and Beyond album and Oh No It's GBH again 12\" ep. 1986 saw the arrival of German drummer Kai Reder who played on three albums and an EP (No Need To Panic, A Fridge Too Far and From Here To Reality, as well as the \"Wot A Bargain\" 12\"), Kai was then replaced by American, Joe \"Fish\" Montanero for one album (Church of The Truly Warped), this was the band's last release for the Rough Justice label.

Dave Mason supplied additional lead guitar on early studio sessions and played at their first live gig. Another participant at their first session as a band was George Harrison, the recording for whose album All Things Must Pass marked the formation of Derek and the Dominos. The band released only one studio album, Layla and Other Assorted Love Songs, produced by Tom Dowd, which also featured notable contributions on slide guitar from Duane Allman. A double album, Layla went on to receive critical acclaim, but initially faltered in sales and in radio airplay. Although released in 1970 it was not until March 1972 that the album's single \"Layla\" (a tale of unrequited love inspired by Clapton's relationship with his friend Harrison's wife, Pattie Boyd) made the top ten in both the United States and the United Kingdom.

The band is composed of founding members (and sisters) Martie Erwin Maguire and Emily Erwin Robison, and lead singer Natalie Maines. The band formed in 1989 in Dallas, Texas, and was originally composed of four women performing bluegrass and country music, busking and touring the bluegrass festival circuits and small venues for six years without attracting a major label. After the departure of one bandmate, the replacement of their lead singer, and a slight change in their repertoire, Dixie Chicks soon achieved commercial success, beginning in 1998 with hit songs \"There's Your Trouble\" and \"Wide Open Spaces\". On March 10, 2003, during a London concert, nine days before the March 19, 2003 invasion of Iraq, lead vocalist Maines told the audience: \"We don't want this war, this violence, and we're ashamed that the President of the United States (George W. Bush) is from Texas\". The positive reaction to this statement from the British audience contrasted with the negative reaction including boycotts that ensued in the US, where the band was denounced by talk-show conservatives, while their albums were discarded in public protest. As of 2015, Dixie Chicks have won 13 Grammy Awards, including five in 2007 for Taking the Long Way\u2014which received the Grammy Award for Album of the Year\u2014and \"Not Ready to Make Nice\", a single from that album. By December 2015, with 30.5 million certified albums sold, and sales of 27.5 million albums in the U.S. alone, they had become the top selling all-female band and biggest selling country group in the U.S. during the Nielsen SoundScan era (1991\u2013present)."@en ;

The band then played under Max Weinberg and The Tonight Show Band during their brief 2009\u20132010 stint on The Tonight Show with Conan O'Brien in Los Angeles. They were then briefly known as the The Legally Prohibited Band during their participation with O'Brien in the 2010 The Legally Prohibited from Being Funny on Television Tour. During The Max Weinberg 7 days, the band included Jimmy Vivino on guitar, Richie \"LaBamba\" Rosenberg on trombone, Scott Healy on keyboard, Mike Merritt on bass guitar, Mark \"Love Man\" Pender on trumpet and acoustic guitar, and Jimmy's older brother Jerry Vivino on woodwinds. When the group moved to Los Angeles to become The Tonight Show Band, they added an eighth member, James Wormworth, on percussion. Wormworth had often substituted as drummer when Weinberg toured with Bruce Springsteen as a member of the E Street Band, prior to being made a permanent fixture in the band; Jimmy Vivino had served as the band's leader during those periods. Weinberg did not participate in the Legally Prohibited Tour and his departure from the group and from O'Brien was made official in September 2010."@en ;

Luce's self-titled first album, released in 2001, met with success in the San Francisco Bay Area, winning the California Music Award for Outstanding Debut. It was promoted heavily on the San Francisco radio station KFOG; a single from the album entitled \"Good Day\" peaked at #39 on the Billboard Adult Top 40 chart. \"Good Day\" was heard in the movies 13 Going on 30 and How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days and TV shows The O.C. and Alias, and was also featured in commercials for American Leather and for Northern California Toyota dealers. The band makes appearances all over Northern California and the U.S.; one notable appearance was at Golden Gate Park for the finish of the 2005 Bay to Breakers race. Luce's second album, Never Ending, was released April 19, 2005, and the first single, \"Buy A Dog\", was the most played song on at least 13 radio stations, including KFOG and WRLT in Nashville. On Nov. 6 of '05, Tom Luce and Adam Rossi sang the national anthem at Arrowhead Stadium before the Kansas City Chiefs hosted the Oakland Raiders. In 2007 the band suffered from two setbacks; Tom Luce's house burnt to the ground and the trailer containing all their equipment was stolen while they were touring. For a short time the band broke up before regrouping and reassembling. In September 2008, Luce went back into the recording studio to record an EP of cover songs; this exercise was a way for the band to improve their musicianship and to rejuvenate and inspire the band. Also in 2008, Luce signed with Opus Music Ventures, a Bay Area record label and in 2009 they released their third album titled \"Corner of the World\". On January 22, 2010 Tom Luce and his two brothers created an album titled \"Luce Brothers.\" In April 2010, Luce released \"The Year We'll Have.\" Luce's most recent studio album is \"Fall to Fly\" which was released in February 2013."@en ;

Each song is written in accordance with a number of rules, including the maximum number of staves, the modes or scales that are used, and the fact that the songs must be playable by any small group of instruments. Given the historical associations of the project's name (see Masada), the Hebrew titles of the compositions, and the Jewish imagery on the covers of the associated albums, Zorn was clearly exploring his Jewish roots, stating, \"The idea with Masada is to produce a sort of radical Jewish music, a new Jewish music which is not the traditional one in a different arrangement, but music for the Jews of today.

	dbo:abstract	"The Michael Nyman Band, formerly known as the Campiello Band, is a group formed as a street band for a 1976 production of Carlo Goldoni's 1756 play, Il Campiello directed by Bill Bryden at the Old Vic. The band did not wish to break up after the production ended, so its director, Michael Nyman, began composing music for the group to perform, beginning with \"In Re Don Giovanni\", written in 1977. Originally made up of old instruments such as rebecs, sackbuts and shawms alongside more modern instruments like the banjo and saxophone to produce as loud a sound as possible without amplification, it later switched to a fully amplified line-up of string quartet, double bass, clarinet, three saxophones, horn, trumpet, bass trombone, bass guitar, and piano. This line up has been variously altered and augmented for some works. The band's first recorded album on a professional label was Nyman's second, the self-titled Michael Nyman (1981), which mostly comprised pieces written for the early films of Peter Greenaway. This album has yet to be released on compact disc. Another self-titled album (1995) has appeared as a promotional item compiling tracks from various other albums, and should not be confused with this one. Along with soundtracks to Greenaway's The Draughtsman's Contract, Drowning by Numbers, and The Cook The Thief His Wife & Her Lover, their 1980s output included The Kiss and Other Movements (which includes the titular art song; a song from Nyman's projected Tristram Shandy opera; a tango; a movement from the same work as \"Memorial\" as used in Greenaway's 26 Bathrooms; and a performance of music (not the original soundtrack) from Greenaway's Making a Splash) and the modern dance work And Do They Do. They also made a limited edition recording of Nyman's La Travers\u00E9e de Paris in 1989; many of its individual movements were soon to be dismantled, revised, or simply transplanted whole, to serve as the soundtrack for Greenaway's Prospero's Books (1991). Conversely, Nyman composed music for another adaptation of William Shakespeare's The Tempest, the ballet-opera Noises, Sounds & Sweet Airs, soon after Prospero's Books, some of which was dervied from La Travers\u00E9e de Paris. Their 1992 album, The Essential Michael Nyman Band, may appear to be a greatest hits compilation, but is actually composed of the concert versions of various film pieces, having undergone years of revisions and refinement, are significantly different from their soundtrack counterparts, to a far more severe extent than typical differences between classical music performances. This album also contains two cuts from the film score to A Zed & Two Noughts, which was originally performed by an orchestra of musicians who were never members of the band, with solos by band members Nyman, Balanescu, Perry, and Leonard. Similarly, The Piano was performed by members of the Munich Philharmonic Orchestra with Harle, Roach, Findon, and Nyman, but is also part of the band's repertoire. In 1993, the band joined with an orchestra for the first time in their recording history with MGV: Musique \u00E0 Grand Vitesse, a piece commissioned for the opening of a TGV line, first performed on 26 September 1993, in which the band, according to Nyman's own liner notes, represents the tracks, \"resisting the temptation of the concerto grosso\". The album credit is to \"The Michael Nyman Band and Orchestra\". The group has largely been superseded by the Michael Nyman Orchestra. Such soundtrack albums as Practical Magic, Ravenous, The End of the Affair, The Claim, and The Libertine are credited to this group, first implied on that 1994 album. While the former two titles lack detailed credits, the latter three albums show that most of the band (not to say most of those credited as full members over its history) performs in the Orchestra. The band's existence is far from over, however, as Nyman orchestrated his 2002 opera, Facing Goya, specifically for the band. His previous two opera recordings include band members but are not formally credited to the band, and one, the aforementioned Noises, Sounds & Sweet Airs, uses a full-scale orchestra, without Nyman at the baton. Man and Boy: Dada (2004) and Love Counts (2005; recorded 2007), Nyman's newest operas, feature the band conducted by Paul McGrath.. In 1996, another offshoot group, The Nyman Quartet, consisting of Cathy Thompson, Gabrielle Lester, Kate Musker, and Tony Hinnigan, recorded The Ballad of Kastriot Rexhepi (with Sarah Leonard--the only singer ever credited as a band member) and Exit No Exit, and plan to record the third recording of Nyman's four string quartets. They are produced by David Cunningham. Many of the current and former band members, including John Harle, Alexander Balanescu, Dave Lee, Madeleine Mitchell, Andrew Findon, and Simon Haram, have released solo albums that include performances of Nyman's music."@en ;

They are named after a square in the city of Munich in Germany, meaning \"Munich liberty\". It is considered part of the Neue Deutsche Welle musical movement. They are best known in the English-speaking world for their single \"Keeping the Dream Alive\". This song became a #14 hit single in the UK Singles Chart when released in December 1988, making M\u00FCnchener Freiheit a one-hit wonder there. Due to its December release and rich orchestral sound, \"Keeping the Dream Alive\" still receives a lot of airplay at Christmas time and can be found included on many Christmas compilation albums. In the United States the song failed to chart there when it was originally released, gaining favour with the American public only after it was featured in the soundtrack for the movie Say Anything.... The single has received additional exposure in the United States thanks to the singing talent contest American Idol on the Fox television network. The song has been used in recent seasons as a backdrop to video montages featuring contestants on the programme."@en ;

Longtime drummer Jeremy Taggart left the band in 2014, and a replacement drummer has not yet been announced. The band has sold millions of albums worldwide, won four Juno Awards, and won ten MuchMusic Video Awards \u2014 the most MMVAs ever awarded to any artist or group. Our Lady Peace are one of Canada's most popular bands, they were also one of the few Canadian rock acts to actually achieved success in both decades of the 90s and 2000s. They have released eight studio albums, one live album, and two compilation albums to date, with their 1997 album Clumsy often being considered their signature and most widely recognized work. Our Lady Peace enjoyed many hit singles, ranging from \"Starseed\" in 1994, to \"Somewhere Out There\" in 2002. The band's earlier albums are often praised for their unique sound and style, with lead singer Maida being called \"erratic\" and \"truly unrivaled\" as a vocalist. Their fifth album, Gravity (2002), is sometimes noted to have been a \"radical departure\" from this distinctive style. Lead singer Maida has confirmed the difference, calling Gravity \"vastly different\" from their previous records. The coincidental 2002 departures of both co-founding member Mike Turner and longtime-producer Arnold Lanni, in combination with influence from then-new producer Bob Rock are sometimes credited as main factors in the style evolution."@en ;

Distinguished by their use of philosophical lyrics, sonic experimentation, extended compositions and elaborate live shows, they are one of the most commercially successful and musically influential groups in the history of popular music. Pink Floyd were founded in 1965 by students Syd Barrett, Nick Mason, Roger Waters, and Richard Wright. They gained popularity performing in London's underground music scene during the late 1960s, and under Barrett's leadership released two charting singles and a successful debut album, The Piper at the Gates of Dawn (1967). David Gilmour joined as a fifth member in December 1967; Barrett left the band in April 1968 due to deteriorating mental health. Waters became the band's primary lyricist and, by the mid-1970s, their dominant songwriter, devising the concepts behind their critically and commercially successful albums The Dark Side of the Moon (1973), Wish You Were Here (1975), Animals (1977), The Wall (1979) and The Final Cut (1983). The Dark Side of the Moon and The Wall became two of the best-selling albums of all time. Wright left Pink Floyd in 1979, followed by Waters in 1985. Gilmour and Mason continued as Pink Floyd; Wright rejoined them as a session musician and, later, a band member. The three produced two more albums, A Momentary Lapse of Reason (1987) and The Division Bell (1994), and toured until 1994. After nearly two decades of acrimony, Pink Floyd reunited with Waters in 2005 for a performance at the global awareness event Live 8, but Gilmour and Waters have since stated they have no plans to reunite as a band again. Barrett died in 2006 and Wright in 2008. The final Pink Floyd studio album, The Endless River, recorded without Waters and based on songs recorded in 1993\u20131994, was released in November 2014. Pink Floyd were inducted into the US Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1996, and the UK Music Hall of Fame in 2005. By 2013, the band had sold more than 250 million records worldwide, including 75 million certified units in the United States."@en ;

The band first came to widespread public attention when their performance of \"Soul Sacrifice\" at Woodstock in 1969 provided a contrast to other acts on the bill. This exposure helped propel their first album, also named Santana, into a hit, followed in the next two years by the successful Abraxas and Santana III. In the years that followed lineup changes were common. Carlos Santana's increasing involvement with guru Sri Chinmoy took the band into more esoteric music, though never quite losing its initial Latin influence. In 1998, the group was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, with Carlos Santana, Jose Chepito Areas, David Brown, Gregg Rolie, Mike Carabello and Michael Shrieve being honored. The band has earned eight Grammy Awards and three Latin Grammy Awards, the latter all in 2000. Carlos also won Grammy Awards as a solo artist in 1989 and 2003. Santana has sold more than 90 million records worldwide, making them one of the world\u2019s best-selling groups of all time.

Despite never playing live, they were interviewed by a fanzine named SKUM, in which Sid Vicious proclaimed \"I'll just be the yob that I am now\". The highly controversial song \"Belsen Was a Gas\", about one of the Nazi concentration camps in Nazi Germany, Bergen-Belsen, which was liberated by British troops in 1945, originates from this band, and was later performed live by the Sex Pistols, Public Image Ltd, as well as Sid Vicious' solo act. Also, Viv Albertine wrote \"So Tough\" for this band, with the song eventually appearing on The Slits' debut album Cut.

	dbo:abstract	"The Miracles (also known as Smokey Robinson and the Miracles from 1965 to 1972) were an American rhythm and blues vocal group that was the first successful recording act for Berry Gordy's Motown Records, and one of the most important and influential groups in pop, rock and roll, and R&B music history. Formed in 1955 by Smokey Robinson, Warren \"Pete\" Moore, and Ronnie White, the group started off as the Five Chimes, changing their name to the Matadors two years later. The group then settled on the Miracles after the inclusion of Claudette Robinson in 1958. The most notable Miracles line-up included the Robinsons, Moore, White, Bobby Rogers and Marv Tarplin. After a failed audition with Brunswick Records, the group began working with songwriter Berry Gordy, who helped to produce their first records for the End and Chess labels before establishing Tamla Records in 1959 and signing the Miracles as its first act. The group eventually scored the label's first million-selling hit record with the 1960 Grammy Hall of Fame smash, \"Shop Around\" , and further established themselves as one of Motown's top acts with the hit singles \"You've Really Got a Hold on Me\", \"What's So Good About Goodbye\", \"Way Over There\", \"I'll Try Something New\", \"Mickey's Monkey\", \"Going to a Go-Go\", \"(Come 'Round Here) I'm the One You Need\", \"Just A Mirage\", \"If You Can Want\", \"More Love\", \"I Don't Blame You at All\", \"Ooo Baby Baby\", the multi-award-winning \"The Tracks of My Tears\", \"Special Occasion\", \"I Second That Emotion\", \"Baby Baby Don't Cry\", the number-one Pop smashes \"The Tears of a Clown\" and \"Love Machine\", \"Do It Baby\" , and \"My Girl Has Gone\". Referred to as Motown's \"soul supergroup\", the Miracles recorded 26 Top 40 Pop hits, sixteen of which reached the Billboard Top 20,seven top 10 singles, and a number one single (\"The Tears of a Clown\") while the Robinsons and Tarplin were members. Following the departure of Tarplin and the Robinsons, the rest of the group continued with singer Billy Griffin and scored two final top 20 singles, \"Do It Baby\" and \"Love Machine\", a second # 1 hit, which topped the charts before the group departed for Columbia Records in 1977, recording as a quintet with Donald Griffin, where after a few releases, they disbanded in 1978. In all, the group had over fifty charted hits by the time they disbanded. On the R&B charts, The Miracles scored 26 Top 10 Billboard R&B hits, with 4 R&B # 1's,and 10 U.S. R&B Top 10 Albums. Bobby Rogers and Ronald White revived the group as a touring ensemble sporadically during the 1980s and again in the 1990s with lead singer Sydney Justin. Following White's death in 1995, Rogers continued to tour with different members until he was forced into retirement due to health issues in 2011, dying less than two years later. The Miracles have been awarded many top music industry honors over the years. In 1997, the group received the Pioneer Award at the Rhythm and Blues Foundation for their musical achievements. Four years later, in 2001, they were inducted to the Vocal Group Hall of Fame. In 2004, they were ranked thirty-two on the Rolling Stone magazine's list of The 100 Greatest Artists of All Time, retaining that same position seven years later, in 2011. Four of their hit songs were inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame. In 2009, the group received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. Throughout their careers, the Miracles were also enshrined with honors for their songwriting by both BMI and ASCAP. In 2008, Billboard listed them at #61 on their 100 most successful Billboard artists ever list. After much controversy, the Miracles were inducted to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2012."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"The Mothers of Invention were an American rock band from California that served as the backing musicians for Frank Zappa. Their work is marked by the use of sonic experimentation, innovative album art, and elaborate live shows. Originally an R&B band called The Soul Giants, the band's original lineup included Ray Collins, David Coronado, Ray Hunt, Roy Estrada and Jimmy Carl Black. Zappa was asked to take over as the guitarist following a fight between Collins and Coronado, the band's original saxophonist/leader. Zappa insisted that they perform his original material, changing their name on Mothers Day to The Mothers (which for legal liability reasons was morphed by record executive decision into The Mothers of Invention), and leading them to substantial popular commercial success. Originally formed in 1964, the band first became popular playing in California's underground music scene in the late 1960s. Under Zappa's helm, it was signed to jazz label Verve Records as part of the label's diversification plans. Verve released the Mothers of Invention's d\u00E9but album Freak Out! in 1966, featuring a lineup including Zappa, Collins, Black, Estrada and Elliot Ingber. Under Zappa's leadership and a changing lineup, the band released a series of critically acclaimed albums, including Absolutely Free, We're Only in It for the Money and Uncle Meat, before being disbanded by Zappa in 1969. In 1970, he formed a new version of the Mothers that included Ian Underwood, Jeff Simmons, George Duke, Aynsley Dunbar and singers Mark Volman and Howard Kaylan (formerly of the Turtles, but who for contractual reasons were credited in this band as the Phlorescent Leech & Eddie). Later adding another ex-Turtle, bassist Jim Pons, this lineup endured through 1971, when Zappa was injured by an audience member during a concert appearance. Zappa focused on big-band and orchestral music while recovering from his injuries, and in 1973 formed the Mothers' final lineup, which included drummer Ralph Humphrey, trumpeter Sal Marquez, keyboardist/vocalist George Duke, trombonist Bruce Fowler, bassist Tom Fowler, percussionist Ruth Underwood and keyboardist/saxophonist Ian Underwood. The final album using the Mothers as a backing band, Bongo Fury (1975), featured guitarist Denny Walley and drummer Terry Bozzio, who continued to play for Zappa on non-Mothers releases."@en ;

Cheese characters. The show was created and manufactured by noted inventor Aaron Fechter, through his company Creative Engineering, Inc. in Orlando, Florida; in addition to overseeing the production of the animatronics, Fechter also provided the voices for several characters. Following the completion of rebranding, the show was sold to other restaurants and entertainment centers, such as Circus Pizza, Pistol Pete's Pizza, and Billy Bob's Wonderland. The characters in The Rock-afire Explosion were various anthropomorphized animals, including a brown bear, a grey wolf, a silverback gorilla, and other species. They would perform medleys of classic rock, pop, and country music, as well as original compositions and comedic skits. The show was pioneering in many respects to other animatronics shows of the early 1980s, featuring life-sized characters capable of facial expression; some were even programmed in such a way that they could actually play simple melodies on musical instruments. At the end of the show's tenure, Chuck E. Cheese marketing director Jul Kamen credited Rock-afire with being largely responsible for Showbiz's financial success. In 2008, original Rock-afire Explosion creator and technical engineer Aaron Fechter, along with Chris Thrash reintroduced the ensemble as a cover band for a variety of pop, rock, and hip-hop groups, including acts ranging from the mid 20th century to the present. Reprogramming the tried and true Rock-afire characters to lay down new beats and vocals, Fechter reached new and younger audiences and also re-connected with the older audience the band had originally entertained in Showbiz Pizza restaurants nationwide."@en ;

The trio was formed in 1983 in Skopje, then SR Macedonia. The line up consisted of: Ana Kostovska (vocalist), Kiril D\u017Eajkovski (keyboards) and Ljubomir Stojsavljevi\u0107 (bass guitar). The author of their lyrics was the internationally acclaimed film director Mil\u010Do Man\u010Devski, at that time a correspondent of the magazines D\u017Euboks and Zdravo from New York City. He was also a director of their music video for the song Hot day in Mexico. The group recorded several songs in Macedonian language for the music production of the national Radio-Television Skopje. They released their debut self-titled album in 1984. Most of the songs on the record, which was released for PGP-RTB from Belgrade are in Serbo-Croat, because it was the most widespreaded language in the former Yugoslav federal market. After they disbanded, D\u017Eajkovski started to work with the prominent Macedonian rock band Leb i sol and played on their albums Kao Kakao and Putujemo. Ana Kostovska continued as a solo singer and actress. In 1987 she was a candidate from Macedonia at Jugovizija, the Yugoslav national pre-selection for the Eurovision Song Contest. In 2006 their first album was re-released on audio CD in Republic of Macedonia by Lithium Records, PMG Recordings and AG Records under the title Works and Rew>>works.

The album also includes two cover versions: \"Beastie Boys\" (from the early Beastie Boys EP Pollywog Stew) and \"Nazi Punks Fuck Off!\" (originally by Dead Kennedys), although the vocals of these have been sped up somewhat (and the songs reduced to one verse and one chorus) to fit into 18 and 17 seconds, respectively."@en ;

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/E.S._Posthumus>	rdf:type	dbo:Band ;
	dbo:abstract	"E.S. Posthumus was an independent music group that produced a form of 21st-century classical music that intertwined popular style drum rhythms with orchestral and electronic sounds. Their music is inspired by the Pythagorean philosophy which states that \"music is the harmonization of opposites; the conciliation of warring elements\". The E.S. is an acronym for \"Experimental Sounds\" while Posthumus (Latin: postumus, meaning \"after\" or \"end\") is a word that is meant to represent \"all things past\", suggesting the music was inspired by things that have ended, some time after they ended. The group was formed in 2000 by brothers Helmut and Franz Vonlichten. Helmut and Franz studied piano with their mother. After graduating from high school, Franz worked in recording studios while Helmut attended and graduated from UCLA, with a degree in archaeology. Their music has been licensed by many movie and television production studios, being included in numerous movie trailers and television shows. E.S. Posthumus released three albums overall in their career. On July 22, 2010, it was officially announced that Franz had died about two months before. After giving notice of his brother's death, Helmut stated that while there still may be one or two unreleased songs (one of them being their single \"Christmas Eve\" released in November 2010), the group would no longer be active. In November 2011, it was officially announced that Helmut Vonlichten had formed a new band called Les Friction, and released a preview of his new work with a track called \"Torture\"."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Karate was an American band, formed in Boston, Massachusetts in 1993 by Geoff Farina, Eamonn Vitt and Gavin McCarthy. In 1995, Jeff Goddard joined the band as bass player, and Vitt moved to second guitar. Vitt departed Karate to pursue a medical career in 1997. The band was characterised by their love for improvised music and classic rock and their adherence to the DIY punk ethos of their youth, which made them difficult to classify, being a strange fusion of indie rock, punk, blues, jazz and post-rock. Farina developed hearing problems due to twelve years of performance with Karate and was forced to disband the group in July 2005, quietly closing the door on a 12-year run that included 6 studio albums and almost 700 performances in 20 countries. Their final show was played in Rome, Italy, on July 10, 2005. Their music was primarily released on Southern Records. Karate\u2019s perfectionism and attention to detail is well known among the music scene. Their compulsive behaviour manifested also in naming their last recording, which was originally called \u201C594\u201D since it was believed to be a recording of their 594th show. When Gavin discovered a flyer for a forgotten early show that had somehow evaded Jeff\u2019s memory, the band quickly changed the title to \u2018595\u2019. Finally, In 2007, the former band members decided to release the live album 595. Often, Karate was sent live material from their own performances (often from sound technicians). This happened also after their performance on May 5 at Stuk, Leuven, Belgium. Karate was so astonished by the quality of the recording they decided to release this \"posthumous\" live album of their 595th live performance. On his own, Geoff Farina has also developed a solo career with three albums and a handful of EPs over the years, some released while the band was still around, and thus far one since Karate disbanded."@en ;

dbr:Lars_Frederiksen_and_the_Bastards	rdf:type	dbo:Band ;
	dbo:abstract	"Lars Frederiksen and the Bastards was an American street punk band formed to release the songs that Lars had written. Their songs include subject matter consisting of drinking, fighting, drugs, sex, prostitutes, gangs, and street life. They are the side project band of Lars Frederiksen from Rancid. The band members are Lars Frederiksen (vocals and lead guitar), Gordy Carbone (also credited as \"Unknown Bastard\") (vocals), Jason Woods, aka Big Jay Bastard, (bass), Craig Leg (rhythm guitar) and Scott Abels (also credited as \"Skatty Punk Rock\") (drums). While Craig did not appear on the first album, he has always been a touring member of the band. The band was formed after Lars' friend and bandmate in Rancid, Tim Armstrong suggested writing songs about Lars and his friend Ben growing up in Campbell, California. The band was then put together as an outlet to release these songs, as well as covers of Billy Bragg's \"To Have and to Have Not\", Holland-Dozier-Holland's \"Leaving Here\" (which was also covered by Mot\u00F6rhead). This first album was named Lars Frederiksen and the Bastards. Lars and Tim then got together to write the second Bastards album, Viking, this time the focus being more on Lars' recent life (with the exception of the songs \"1%\", \"The Kids Are Quiet on Sharmon Palms\" and \"The Viking\".) after having \"got outta Campbell\". The album also included cover versions of The Blasters' \"Marie, Marie\" and the Anti-Nowhere League's \"For You\". The song \"Little Rude Girl\" was originally intended to be used as a Rancid song, slated to appear on an aborted split 7\" with Rancid and Richmond, VA punk band Avail on Lookout! Records. The album was mixed by Brett Gurewitz of Bad Religion. It is also currently stated that Lars has no intention of creating another \"Lars Frederiksen and the Bastards\" album.[citation needed]"@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"The Mills Blue Rhythm Band was an American big band of the 1930s. The band was formed in Harlem in 1930, with reedman Bingie Madison the first of its many leaders. It started life as the Coconut Grove Orchestra, changing to Mills Blue Rhythm Band when Irving Mills became its manager in 1931. At various times the same group was known as the \"Blue Rhythm Band\", \"Blue Ribbon Band\", \"Blue Rhythm Boys\", \"The Blue Racketeers\", \"Earl Jackson's Musical Champions\", \"Earl Jackson and his Orchestra\", \"Duke Wilson and his Ten Blackberries\", \"King Carter's Royal Orchestra\", \"Mills Music Masters\", \"Harlem Hot Shots\" and uncredited playing behind Louis Armstrong. The Mills Blue Rhythm Band were based at The Cotton Club in Manhattan. They worked steadily through the 1930s deputizing for the Duke Ellington and Cab Calloway Orchestras; often taking their undesirable engagements. Violinist Carroll Dickerson briefly fronted the band, followed by Drummer Willie Lynch in 1931 and then compere Jimmy Ferguson (Baron Lee). Edgar Hayes, Eddie Mallory and Dave Nelson all had temporary stints as band leader until Lucky Millinder permanently took over the role in 1934. The band recorded 150 sides for a variety of labels including Brunswick, Columbia, Victor, the ARC stable of labels (including Oriole, Perfect, Regal, Romeo, Banner, Melotone, Domino), Variety, and Vocalion. Despite success with a few hit records (including \"Truckin'\" and \"Ride, Red, Ride\") and a strong lineup of talented soloists, the group never attained the prominence of their peers. This is often attributed to the lack of a single identifiable leader, and Irving Mills' preference to have the band perform an understudy role. The group disbanded in 1938. Millinder joined Bill Doggett's band before reforming it into his own orchestra in 1940 Irving Mills revived the Mills Blue Rhythm Band name for two recording sessions in 1947 under the guidance of Van Alexander. The only original band member at either of the 1947 sessions was trumpeter Charlie Shavers. Many of the Mills Blue Rhythm Band's recordings are now considered jazz classics by collectors. Original records regularly appear on auction lists, and recent reissue and remastering projects have made their recordings more widely available."@en ;

Rex. \"Ride a White Swan\" coincided with this change and instantly became a commercial success. From 1970 until 1973, T. Rex encountered in the UK a popularity unseen since the demise of the Beatles, with a run of 11 singles ranked in the British top ten. 1971's Electric Warrior received sustained critical acclaim as a pioneering album of glam rock. It reached the number 1 position in the UK. The follow-up, 1972's The Slider, allowed the band to enter in the top 5 in the USA. At the end of 1973, T. Rex started to have less commercial success but kept on recording one album per year. In 1977, Bolan died in a car accident a couple of months after releasing their final studio album Dandy in the Underworld. Since then, T.

Five years of constant performing established them as one of the premier club bands in the Greater Toronto Area.

An independent video in 1984 for the song \"Take Me As I Am\" brought them limited national exposure, though the song never appeared on any full length release. 1986 saw The Jitters in an opening slot for Huey Lewis and the News at the Canadian National Exhibition, and tying for third place in Q107's Homegrown Contest with the song \"Last of the Red Hot Fools\". These two events helped open doors with Capitol Records who proceeded to sign the band. The Jitters had several songs that were ready for release, and after spending some extra time in the studio with producer Paul Gross, released their eponymous debut in 1987. \"Last Of The Red Hot Fools\" was the first single and became a radio hit throughout the country, and they were nominated at the 1989 Juno Awards in the category of Most Promising Group of the Year. In 1988, they played support for Heart on their UK tour. Three years later, The Jitters released their second and final album Louder Than Words. The result of a collaboration with American songwriter/producer Jules Shear, Louder Than Words was the last effort for the group who split in 1991 due to the pressures of constant club tours."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Virgos Merlot was an American hard rock band formed in 1998. Prior to the formation of Virgos Merlot, many of the band members were in the group The Devine, which later disbanded. After formation, their first album, Signs of a Vacant Soul, was released in 1999. The original lineup disbanded after the release of Signs of a Vacant Soul, with the band later reforming without guitarist Jason Marchant. During this period, they were known simply as Virgos and self-released an album, The Path of Least Resistance. Virgos disbanded in 2002. After touring with Creed as replacement live bassist for Brian Marshall, Brett Hestla joined Dark New Day in 2004. Marchant, Charlton and Ledbetter went on to form the band Red Halo. Chris Dickerson later played bass for Downstem [with Charlton on drums] and Course of Nature. In October 2008, it was stated by four of the original five band members, that they would reunite for a tenth year anniversary, and a show was performed on January 9, 2009 in Birmingham, Alabama. The concert featured Marchant on lead guitar, Deacon on guitar, Dickerson on bass, Charlton on drums, and Chase Davidson from Red Halo on vocals; making Hestla the only former member not returning for the reunion. An EP was also being recorded with three new songs. However, in November 2009, Ledbetter died from complications related to diabetes, leaving the future of the band unknown."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Indian Ocean is an Indian rock band formed in New Delhi in 1990, who are widely recognized as the pioneers of the fusion rock genre in India. Susmit Sen, Asheem Chakravarty, Rahul Ram and Amit Kilam were band members till Chakravarty's death on 25 December 2009, after which Tuheen Chakravorty and Himanshu Joshi were officially inducted into the band as replacements. After the departure of Susmit Sen in 2013, Rahul Ram is the only founding member who appeared on the band's debut album Indian Ocean. The musical style of the band can be at best classified as fusion music. It is an experimental genre, fusing raga (traditional Indian tunes) with rock music, guitars and drums, sometimes using Indian folk songs. It has also been described by some music critics as \"Indo-rock fusion with jazz-spiced rhythms that integrates shlokas, sufism, environmentalism, mythology and revolution\". Since 2010, the band has moved against the lines of record labels. They released their latest album 16/330 Khajoor Road online for free. The main reason for this move was the frustration over negotiating contracts with record companies and fighting over copyright issues. They have turned to concerts and sponsorships for generating revenue rather than playing in the hands of record labels. For a brief amount of time they had the sponsorship of Johnnie Walker. They are also a part of the world's first Music Personalisation Initiative named DRP as one of the five Featured Artists. In its 2014 listing of \"25 Greatest Indian Rock Songs of the last 25 Years\", \"Rolling Stone India\" featured two songs, Ma Rewa and Kandisa from the album, Kandisa (2000)."@en ;

Their music is characterised by a melodic blend of pop, folk and traditional Celtic influences. Often compared to Scottish bands with a similar sound like Big Country, Del Amitri and The Proclaimers, The Silencers have distinguished themselves with their eclectic sounds, prolific output and continued career. Their first single, \"Painted Moon,\" was a minor international hit and invited critical comparisons to Simple Minds and U2. In 1987 they released their first album A Letter From St. Paul, which included \"Painted Moon\" and another minor hit, \"I See Red.\" Buoyed by the huge European hit \"Bulletproof Heart\", the band's third album Dance to the Holy Man is the band's commercial peak to date. Throughout the 1990s, The Silencers saw a popular taste shift away from their songwriter-based style of music toward grunge and electronic music."@en ;

Wolfmother released their self-titled debut album Wolfmother in Australia in 2005, and internationally in 2006, which has since sold over 1.5 million copies worldwide and won the band a number of industry awards. Ross and Heskett left the band in 2008. Stockdale returned with a new lineup featuring Peres, rhythm guitarist Aidan Nemeth and drummer Dave Atkins in 2009, releasing Cosmic Egg later in the year. After more personnel changes, the group's planned third album was released in 2013 as Keep Moving, a Stockdale solo album. Later that year, Wolfmother returned as a trio featuring Peres and drummer Vin Steele for 2014's New Crown. The band's fourth album Victorious was released in February 2016. Wolfmother have been categorised by various commentators within the genres of hard rock, heavy metal, stoner rock and psychedelic rock. They are often compared to influential classic rock and metal bands from the 1960s and 1970s, including Led Zeppelin, Black Sabbath, Blue Cheer and AC/DC. Frontman Stockdale has typically led songwriting for the group, although the material on the band's debut album was co-credited to Ross and Heskett.

It consisted of Adam Nathanson on guitars, Neil Burke on bass, John Kriksciun on drums, and on vocals, Combined Effort all ages shows promoter and fanzine editor Jason O'Toole. They were part of the scene that grew out of CBGB's Sunday matinees and Some Records. Life's Blood gained a loyal following with their aggressive sound that blended East Coast hardcore-punk with melodic Oi!, as well as their biting, intelligent lyrics. Life's Blood performed with bands as diverse as Agnostic Front, Sheer Terror, Beyond, Judge, Project X, and Soulside before breaking up little more than a year later. Nathanson would go on to form Born Against out of its ashes with Sam McPheeters on vocals. Kriksciun would continue drumming for Collapse and Burn, among many other acts. Burke, an artist who works in visual and audio mediums would go on to many important bands, including Born Against, Sinking Body and Men's Recovery Project. In 1992, O'Toole performed and recorded with Factory with past and future members of Intent, Hail Mary, Brown Cuts Neighbors and Limp Wrist. In 2011, O'Toole sang for My Rifle on a self-titled EP backed by former members of Our Gang, Hell No, and Absolution, on Wardance Records. This may be the only punk record to receive a glowing review from Maximumrocknroll despite the vocalist's twenty years in law enforcement. Life's Blood played live on WNYU and WFMU, and played 26 shows throughout New York, New Jersey, Connecticut and Ohio. Their songs have been covered live and on recordings by bands from as far flung as Sweden and Japan as well as by American hardcore bands. A notable cover being the version of \"It's not in your heart\" by MK-ULTRA. Finland's Down Your Throat covered \"Youth Enrage\" on their album \"Real Heroes Die.\" Among Life's Blood's recordings are Defiance originally on Combined Effort, the Vermiform Records compilation EP Murders Among Us, the New York Hardcore compilation Where the Wild Things Are on Blackout Records, the New Breed compilation, a split 7\" with {Sticks And Stones]], as well as a rash of bootlegs.

	dbo:abstract	"Sublime was an American ska punk band from Long Beach, California, formed in 1988. The band's line-up, unchanged until their breakup, consisted of Bradley Nowell (vocals and guitar), Eric Wilson (bass) and Bud Gaugh (drums). Lou Dog, Nowell's dalmatian was the mascot of the band. Michael 'Miguel' Happoldt and Marshall Goodman \"Ras MG\" contributed to and co-wrote several Sublime songs. Nowell died of a heroin overdose in 1996. In 1997, posthumous songs such as \"What I Got\", \"Santeria\", \"Wrong Way\", \"Doin' Time\", and \"April 29, 1992 (Miami)\" were released to U.S. radio. Sublime released three studio albums, one live album, five compilation albums (one of which also contains never-before released material), three EPs and one box set. Although their first two albums\u201440oz. to Freedom (1992) and Robbin' the Hood (1994)\u2014were quite popular in the United States, Sublime did not experience major commercial success until 1996 with their self-titled third album, released two months after Nowell's death, which peaked at No. 13 on the Billboard 200, and spawned the single \"What I Got\", which remains the band's only No. 1 hit single (on the Billboard Alternative Songs chart) in their musical career. As of 2009, the band has sold over 17 million albums worldwide, including about 10 million in the U.S. alone. In 2009, the surviving members decided to reform the band with Rome Ramirez, a young guitarist and admitted Sublime fan from California. However, not long after performing at Cypress Hill's Smokeout Festival, a Los Angeles judge banned the new lineup from using the Sublime name. This was because Nowell had owned rights to the Sublime name, and as a result, they were not allowed to use it without approval and permission from his estate. In January 2010, the lawsuit was settled and the new lineup now performs together as Sublime with Rome, who released their debut album Yours Truly on July 12, 2011. Five months after its release, Gaugh announced his departure from the band."@en ;

Caifanes\u2019 style can be described as a hybrid of British new wave, progressive rock, and Latin percussion underscored by deep, somber, and Latin American-Mexican-Spanish influenced lyrics and the vocal style of Sa\u00FAl Hern\u00E1ndez. Members of Caifanes have cited King Crimson as a major influence. The name Caifanes is derived from 1940s Mexican Pachuco (zoot suiter) slang \"Cai fan\". Its equivalent in English would be something like \u201Ccool dude.\u201D The word has also been used to describe the proverbial Mexican Pachuco, delinquent, or outsider."@en ;

The band charted 32 more singles between then and 2006, including four more that reached No. 1: \"How Your Love Makes Me Feel\" (1997), \"One More Day\" (2001), \"Beautiful Mess\" (2002), and \"I Believe\" (2003). Diamond Rio has recorded nine studio albums, four Greatest Hits compilations, and an album of Christmas music. Three of the band's albums have achieved RIAA platinum certification in the United States. In addition, Diamond Rio has received four Group of the Year awards from the Country Music Association, two Top Vocal Group awards from the Academy of Country Music, and one Grammy Award out of thirteen nominations. The band is known for its vocal harmonies, varied instrumentation, and near-exclusive use of only its own membership on recordings instead of session musicians. Their sound was originally defined by mainstream country, bluegrass, and rock influences, but later albums drew more influence from Christian country music and country pop."@en ;

The single \"Hey Kid\" became a minor hit and its video received some rotation on MTV Guitarist J.J. Bolt and then-future Guns N' Roses members Dizzy Reed and Matt Sorum joined the band to replace Worchell and Adamo. However, before the second album could be released Johnny Crash were dropped by their record label, and Chris suggested moving to Europe. Vicki disagreed and the band split up. In 1992, bassist Andy Rogers died of a heroin overdose.[citation needed] In 2007, an interview with Vicki James Wright stated that the then unreleased album, now titled Unfinished Business, will come out on Suncity Records sometime \"soon\".In 2008, Unfinished Business was released on Suncity Records.

In 1989, after Hunter and Berdon left to pursue other projects, the band was rebranded with the addition of Judd Austin and Trey Sabatelli as \"The Gone Jackals\", releasing their first album Out and About with the Gone Jackals in 1990. The band's music generally consisted of hard, garage and blues rock. Their next album, Bone to Pick (1995) also incorporated heavy metal. The band collaborated with Peter McConnell of LucasArts to produce the soundtrack to the biker-themed adventure game Full Throttle; tracks from Bone to Pick were specifically adapted for this purpose. Blue Pyramid (1998), their third and final album, also included experimentation with psychedelic rock. The band broke up in 1999, though not before signing up a new label for distributing their music in Europe. In late 2001, Karloff started working on a new musical project. Led by his passion for the old style rock music, he formed the Bonedrivers, a blues rock power trio which has since then toured the United States and published a locally acclaimed debut album named Roadhouse Manifesto, an even bigger second outing titled Mobile, and a third one titled Greasefire."@en ;

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Timo_Rautiainen_&_Trio_Niskalaukaus>	rdf:type	dbo:Band ;
	dbo:abstract	"Timo Rautiainen ja Trio Niskalaukaus (fin. \"Timo Rautiainen and Trio Neckshot\") was a metal music band from Finland, formed in 1997. The band was led by Timo Rautiainen, leading member of Finnish metallers Lyijykomppania, a band which still has an underground cult following in the scene. The musical influence of the band ranges from Black Sabbath to more modern metal acts. Lyrically, themes presented in songs range from global issues (such as global warming, genocide, war and nuclear waste or nuclear weapons left at loose) to personal tragedy (such as death of a loved one, school bullying and suicide), typically in a dark and serious tone. They have released 7 albums to date. For more than 20 years, Timo has made music in the Finnish language. However, when a friend came up to him with the idea of making a German spoken album, Timo became very interested. The album produced during this session, In frostigen T\u00E4lern (\"In Frozen Valleys\") (2001), was the first German album by a Finnish act. In 2004 the band released their second album in German, titled Hartes Land (\"Hard Land\"). The albums in German basically consist of songs which have already been released in Finnish and later translated. A visional cue in the band's album art is that no uppercase letters are used in any occasion. Their logo is a hammer crossed with a pickaxe, usually both covered with breeze. The band has published several music videos, some of them dedicated to (and filmed with) Finnish military serving under KFOR mission in Kosovo. A biographical book about Timo and his bands was released in 2003. It was written by Finnish journalist Timo Isoaho. The band announced that it would be going on break for an indefinite period of time as of December 2004. On November 1, 2006, the band announced that they would be breaking up."@en ;

The group is also associated with other major French hip hop artists such as Doc Gyneco and Hamed Daye. The group's name means 'ministry of action, music and rap'. Also 'amer' means 'bitter'. Their first single, Tra\u00EEtres, was released in 1991, and it was followed by the album Pourquoi tant de haine? in 1991. The second album, 95200, came out in 1994. In 1995, after their song Sacrifice de poulet, which appeared on the soundtrack to the film La Haine, provoked the French Minister of the Interior, Charles Pasqua, to attack the group in court. The court's ruling forced the group to pay 250,000 francs of fines, but Mr Pasqua's demands for banning sales of Minist\u00E8re AMER's discs were unsuccessful. However, radio stations were reluctant to play their music after this incident, and the only station who continued to do so was Generation 88.2, an underground parisian station dedicated to hip hop music. Members of the band began to pursue solo careers after the release of their second album, and Stomy Bugsy released his first solo album Le calibre qu'il te faut in 1997. Passi also released Les tentations the same year. After the success these albums enjoyed, Kenzy created the record label Secteur \u00C4 to accommodate Minist\u00E8re AMER and other hip hop artists, such as N\u00E8g' Marrons, \u00C4rsenik, Doc Gyn\u00E9co, Hamed Daye, and Tandem.

In the beginning their name was Radio Chantaje (Blackmail Radio), and later they became No, but upon the knowledge of another band called the same, they changed their name to No de Tijuana (Not From Tijuana), to later just shorten it to Tijuana No!. They were characterized by the social criticism in their lyrics, where they also showed their support to the EZLN, and made reference in their songs to racial, cultural, international, and governmental problems, like the immigration policies in the United States. In 1991 they recorded their first album under an independent label, and one year later (1992) they released the same album (with some design changes) under Culebra Records (BMG), who gave them international recognition promoting the single Pobre de Ti (Poor You). In its early stages they had the participation of Mexican singer Julieta Venegas, who left the band and started a solo career. Luis G\u00FCere\u00F1a, one of the three singers the group had, died in 2004 due to a heart attack while he was watching television at his home in Tijuana. He was discovered by one of his best friends, Paul Thomas, of No Cover Magazine. Thomas tried to revive G\u00FCere\u00F1a to no avail. The group officially disbanded in December 2002, although they have met occasionally to pay tribute to their companion Luis G\u00FCere\u00F1a."@en ;

dbr:Wilco	rdf:type	dbo:Band ;
	dbo:abstract	"Wilco is an American alternative rock band based in Chicago, Illinois. The band was formed in 1994 by the remaining members of alternative country group Uncle Tupelo following singer Jay Farrar's departure. Wilco's lineup changed frequently during its first decade, with only singer Jeff Tweedy and bassist John Stirratt remaining from the original incarnation. Since early 2004, the lineup has been unchanged, consisting of Tweedy, Stirratt, guitarist Nels Cline, multi-instrumentalist Pat Sansone, keyboard player Mikael Jorgensen, and drummer Glenn Kotche. Wilco has released nine studio albums, a live double album, and four collaborations: three with Billy Bragg and one with The Minus 5. Wilco's music has been inspired by a wide variety of artists and styles, including Bill Fay, The Beatles and Television, and has in turn influenced music by a number of modern alternative rock acts. The band continued in the alternative country of Uncle Tupelo on its debut album A.M. (1995), but has since introduced more experimental aspects to their music, including elements of alternative rock and classic pop. Wilco's musical style has evolved from a 1990s country rock sound to a current \"eclectic indie rock collective that touches on many eras and genres.\" Wilco garnered media attention for their fourth album, Yankee Hotel Foxtrot (2002), and the controversy surrounding it. After the recording sessions were complete, Reprise Records rejected the album and dismissed Wilco from the label. As part of a buy-out deal, Reprise gave Wilco the rights to the album for free. After streaming Foxtrot on its website, Wilco sold the album to Nonesuch Records in 2002. Both record labels are subsidiaries of Warner Music Group, leading one critic to say the album showed \"how screwed up the music business is in the early twenty-first century.\" Yankee Hotel Foxtrot is Wilco's most successful release to date, selling over 670,000 copies. Wilco won two Grammy Awards for their fifth studio album, 2004's A Ghost Is Born, including Best Alternative Music Album. Wilco's most recent studio album, Star Wars, was released on July 16, 2015."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Bananarama are an English female pop music vocal group formed in London in 1979 by friends Sara Dallin, Siobhan Fahey and Keren Woodward. Their success on both pop and dance charts have earned the group a listing in The Guinness Book of World Records as the all-female group with the most chart entries in the world, a record which they still hold. They released their debut single \"Aie a Mwana\" in 1981. The group's 10 UK Top 10 hits include \"It Ain't What You Do...\" (1982), \"Really Saying Something\" (1982), \"Shy Boy\" (1982), \"Na Na Hey Hey Kiss Him Goodbye\" (1983), \"Cruel Summer\" (1983), \"Robert De Niro's Waiting...\" (1984) and \"Love in the First Degree\" (1987). In 1986, they had a US number one with another of their UK Top 10 hits, \"Venus\". In total, they had 11 singles reach the US Billboard Hot 100 (1983-1988), including two more in the top 10, with \"Cruel Summer\" (1984) and \"I Heard a Rumour\" (1987). They are associated with the MTV-driven Second British Invasion of the US. In 1988, \"Love in the First Degree\" earned them a Brit Award nomination for Best British Single, while their fourth album Wow! (1987), topped the Australian ARIA albums chart. Following Fahey's departure from the group in 1988, Jacquie O'Sullivan joined the group for three years and they had UK Top 10 hits with \"I Want You Back\" (1988) and \"Help!\" (1989). In addition to their chart success, the band is also known for their vocal style, generally singing in unison rather than in harmony like most vocal groups. Since 1992, Woodward and Dallin have continued Bananarama as a duo, with hits including \"Movin' On\" (1992) and \"More, More, More\" (1993). They returned to the UK Top 20 for the first time since 1991 with the 2005 single \"Move in My Direction\". Between 1982 and 2009, they had 28 singles reach the Top 50 of the UK singles chart."@en ;

Formed in 1983, Bon Jovi consists of lead singer and namesake Jon Bon Jovi (born John Francis Bongiovi, Jr.), pianist and keyboard player David Bryan, and drummer Tico Torres. The band's lineup has remained mostly static during its history, with the only exceptions being the 1994 dismissal of bass player Alec John Such, who was unofficially replaced by Hugh McDonald, and the departure of longtime guitarist and co-songwriter Richie Sambora in 2013. In 1986, Bon Jovi achieved widespread global recognition with their third album, Slippery When Wet. The band's fourth album, New Jersey was equally successful in 1988.

In 1992, the band returned with the album Keep the Faith. Their 2000 single \"It's My Life\", which followed a second hiatus, successfully introduced the band to a younger audience. Bon Jovi have been known to use different styles in their music, which has included country for their 2007 album Lost Highway.

Consisting of singer John McCrea, trumpeter Vince DiFiore, guitarist Xan McCurdy, bassist Gabe Nelson and drummer Paulo Baldi, the band has been noted for McCrea's sarcastic lyrics and deadpan voice, DiFiore's trumpet parts, and their wide-ranging musical influences, including country music, Mariachi, rock, funk, Iranian folk music and hip hop. Cake was formed in 1991 by McCrea, DiFiore, Greg Brown, Frank French and Sean McFessel, who soon left and was replaced by Nelson. Following the self-release of its debut album, Motorcade of Generosity, the band was signed to Capricorn Records in 1995 and released its first single, \"Rock 'n' Roll Lifestyle\", which hit number 35 on the Modern Rock Tracks music chart and was featured on MTV's 120 Minutes; French and Nelson then left the band, and were replaced by Todd Roper and Victor Damiani. Cake's second album, 1996's Fashion Nugget, went platinum on the strength of its lead single, \"The Distance\". Following a tour of Europe and the United States, both Brown and Damiani announced they were leaving Cake, which led to speculation about the band's future; McCrea eventually recruited Xan McCurdy to take over on guitar, and persuaded Nelson to return. Prolonging the Magic, the band's third album, was released in 1998 and went platinum, having shipped over one million units; this was followed three years later by Comfort Eagle, the band's first album on Columbia Records, featuring the single \"Short Skirt/Long Jacket\" which hit number 7 on the Modern Rock Tracks chart. Following a series of tours, including several versions of the Unlimited Sunshine Tour, the band released Pressure Chief in 2004, its second and last album on Columbia. After creating its own label, Upbeat Records, the band released Showroom of Compassion in 2011, which became its first album to debut at the top of the Billboard charts, selling 44,000 copies in the first week after release."@en ;

They originally performed a speed metal style with Venom influences. Kreator's work began in the vein of thrash metal but ventured into industrial metal and gothic metal from 1992 to 1999, before eventually returning to their classic thrash sound to date. The band has achieved worldwide sales of over two million units for combined sales of all their albums, making them one of the best-selling German thrash metal bands of all time. To date, Kreator has released thirteen studio albums, two EPs, one live album and three compilation albums. They gained a large underground fanbase in the international thrash metal community, and were one of the first German thrash metal bands to sign to a major label (Epic Records in 1988). However, Kreator would not have success until later albums, including their thirteenth studio album Phantom Antichrist (2012), which peaked at higher chart positions in many countries.

Their current lineup includes Terry Scott Taylor (Daniel Amos, the Swirling Eddies), Michael Roe (The 77s), Derri Daugherty and Steve Hindalong (The Choir). The original lineup included Gene Eugene (Adam Again), who died in 2000. The band's eclectic blending of folk, blues, country, and rock has been characterized as \"a sort of CCM equivalent to the Traveling Wilburys\". The band released their debut album Scenic Routes in 1992 as a one-time collaboration. Lost Dogs concert performances are filled with between-song jokes and one-liners between the band members (usually poking fun at each other). Many Lost Dogs albums include at least one or two cover songs. Songs covered by Lost Dogs on an album or in concert include Bob Dylan's \"Lord Protect My Child\", Leonard Cohen's \"If It Be Your Will\", The Beatles' \"I'm A Loser\", \"The Chipmunk Song (Christmas Don't Be Late)\", and Stephen Foster's \"Hard Times, Come Again No More\". In March, 2000, shortly after the release of their Gift Horse album, Gene Eugene died. In 2004, the band got together with Steve Hindalong to produce a special album for their summer tour. The result was entitled MUTT, and included new acoustic versions of ten songs originally written and recorded for each band member's regular rock bands. The following year, the band would release the almost entirely instrumental Island Dreams. The Lost Cabin and the Mystery Trees, was released July 2006. In 2008, the Lost Dogs traveled down historic Route 66 with cinematographer Jimmy Abegg. Abegg filmed the band's experiences.

The band was formed in 1996 by lead songwriter and keyboardist Tuomas Holopainen, guitarist Emppu Vuorinen, and lead singer Tarja Turunen. The band soon picked up drummer Jukka Nevalainen, and then bassist Sami V\u00E4nsk\u00E4 after the release of their debut album, Angels Fall First (1997). In 2002, V\u00E4nsk\u00E4 was replaced by Marco Hietala, who also took over the male vocalist role previously filled by Holopainen or guest singers. Although Nightwish have been prominent in their home country since Angels Fall First, they did not achieve worldwide fame until the release of the albums Oceanborn (1998), Wishmaster (2000) and Century Child (2002). Their 2004 album, Once, has sold more than one million copies and was the band's breakthrough in the United States. Their biggest US hit single, \"Wish I Had an Angel\" (2004), received MTV airplay and was included on three US film soundtracks to promote their North American tour. The band produced three more singles and two music videos for Once, as well as a re-recording of \"Sleeping Sun\" for the \"best of\" compilation album, Highest Hopes (2005), before Turunen's dismissal in October 2005. Her last performance with Nightwish was during a concert recorded for the live album/DVD End of an Era. After the concert, the other members informed Turunen with an open letter that she was no longer a member of Nightwish. In May 2007, Nightwish announced Anette Olzon as Turunen's replacement. That September, the band released their sixth album, Dark Passion Play, which has sold almost 2 million copies. The album's lead single, \"Amaranth\", became one of Nightwish's most successful in Europe. The supporting tour, one of the band's largest, started on October 6, 2007 and ended on September 19, 2009. The band released an EP/live album, Made in Hong Kong (And in Various Other Places), in March 2009 as a CD/DVD, and their seventh studio album, Imaginaerum, was released globally on various days in late 2011/early 2012. On October 1, 2012, Nightwish announced that they had parted ways with Olzon and would be finishing the current tour with ReVamp and former After Forever vocalist Floor Jansen. In October 2013, Nightwish made Jansen and longtime session uillean pipes player Troy Donockley permanent members of the band, and they were featured in the acclaimed album Endless Forms Most Beautiful, released in March, 2015. Nightwish is the third-best-selling band and musical entity in Finland with certified sales of nearly 900,000 certified copies.

	dbo:abstract	"Nine Inch Nails (abbreviated NIN; stylized as NI\u0418) is an American industrial rock band, founded in 1988 by Trent Reznor in Cleveland, Ohio. As its main producer, singer, songwriter, and instrumentalist, Reznor is the only official member of the group and remains solely responsible for its direction. Nine Inch Nails' music straddles a wide range of genres. After recording a new album, Reznor usually assembles a live band to perform with him. The touring band features a revolving lineup that often rearranges songs to fit a live setting. On stage, Nine Inch Nails often employs visual elements to accompany performances, which frequently include light shows. Underground music audiences warmly received Nine Inch Nails in its early years. Reznor produced several highly influential records in the 1990s that achieved widespread popularity: many Nine Inch Nails songs became radio hits; and their entire catalog has reached record sales exceeding over 20 million albums worldwide, with 10 million sales certified in the United States alone. In 1997, Reznor appeared in Time magazine's list of the year's most influential people, and Spin magazine described him as \"the most vital artist in music.\"In 2004, Rolling Stone placed Nine Inch Nails at 94 on its list of the 100 greatest artists of all time. Despite this acclaim, the band has had several feuds with the corporate side of the recording industry. In 2007, these corporate entanglements resulted in Reznor announcing that Nine Inch Nails would split from its label and release future material independently. Since 1989, Nine Inch Nails has released eight studio albums. After a hiatus from 2009 to 2013, Nine Inch Nails released Hesitation Marks, through Columbia Records. Prior to this, Ghosts I\u2013IV and The Slip were both independently released in digital form, with physical releases coming later. The digital release of the latter was made available completely free of charge, and the former, while also available for sale, can be acquired legally through means such as file-sharing due to its Creative Commons license. Nine Inch Nails has been nominated for thirteen Grammy Awards and won twice for the songs \"Wish\" and \"Happiness in Slavery\", in 1992 and 1996 respectively. In 2014, Nine Inch Nails was named as nominees for induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, their first year of eligibility. In 2015, they were nominated a second time."@en ;

Their best-known line-up from their heyday (1994\u20131996) consisted of Jarvis Cocker (vocals, guitar), Candida Doyle (keyboards), Russell Senior (guitar, violin), Mark Webber (guitar, keyboards), Steve Mackey (bass) and Nick Banks (drums). Senior quit in 1996 and returned for tours in 2011, while Leo Abrahams had been a touring member of the band since they reunited in 2011, contributing electric and acoustic guitar. Throughout the 1980s, the band struggled to find success, but gained prominence in the UK in the mid-1990s with the release of the albums His 'n' Hers in 1994 and particularly Different Class in 1995, which reached the number one spot in the UK Albums Chart. Different Class spawned four top ten singles, including \"Common People\" and \"Sorted for E's & Wizz\", both of which reached number two in the UK Singles Chart. Pulp's musical style during this period consisted of disco influenced pop-rock coupled with \"kitchen sink drama\"-style lyrics. Jarvis Cocker and the band became reluctant figures in the Britpop movement, and were nominated for the Mercury Music Prize in 1994 for His 'n' Hers; they won the prize in 1996 for Different Class and were nominated again in 1998 for This Is Hardcore. They headlined the Pyramid Stage of the Glastonbury Festival twice. The band released We Love Life, in 2001, after which they entered an extended hiatus, having sold more than 10 million records. Pulp reunited and played live again in 2011, with dates at the Isle of Wight Festival, Reading and Leeds Festivals, Pohoda, Sziget Festival, Primavera Sound, the Exit festival, and the Wireless Festival. A number of additional concert dates have since been added to their schedule. In January 2013 Pulp released \"After You\", a re-recording of a We Love Life demo track, as a digital download single.

	dbo:abstract	"Slayer is an American thrash metal band from Huntington Park, California, formed in 1981 by guitarists Jeff Hanneman and Kerry King. Slayer rose to fame with its 1986 release Reign in Blood, and is credited as one of the \"big four\" thrash metal bands, along with Metallica, Megadeth, and Anthrax. Since its debut album in 1983, the band has released twelve studio albums, two live albums, a box set, six music videos, two extended plays and a cover album. Four of the band's studio albums have received gold certification in the United States. The band has received five Grammy nominations, winning one in 2007 for the song \"Eyes of the Insane\", and one in 2008 for the song \"Final Six\" (both from 2006's Christ Illusion). Slayer has also played at several music festivals worldwide, including Unholy Alliance, Download and Ozzfest. Slayer's musical style involves fast tremolo picking, double bass drumming, riffs in irregular scales and shouted vocals. In the original line-up, King, Hanneman, and lead vocalist/bassist Tom Araya contributed to the band's lyrics, and most of the band's music was written by King and Hanneman, with additional help from Araya and drummer Dave Lombardo. The band's lyrics and album art, which cover topics such as murder, serial killers, necrophilia, torture, genocide, human experimentation, Satanism, hate crimes, terrorism, religion, antireligion, Nazism, and warfare, have generated album bans, delays, lawsuits, and criticism from religious groups and the public. However, its music has been highly influential, often being cited by many bands as an influence musically, visually, and lyrically. Between 1991 and 2013, the band sold 4.9 million albums in the United States."@en ;

The band was one of the few groups to emerge from the early 1980s New York no wave scene and stay intact into the next decade. Formed by Gira in 1982, Swans employed a shifting lineup of musicians until their dissolution in 1997. Besides Gira, the only other constant members were keyboardist/vocalist/songwriter Jarboe from 1984 to 1997, and semi-constant guitarist Norman Westberg. The band became known for its experimental instrumentation and repetitive song structures. In 2010, Gira reformed Swans without Jarboe."@en ;

Their first work appeared on the Soul City label, which was started by Imperial Records/United Artists Records recording artist Johnny Rivers. The group would later record for Bell/Arista Records, ABC Records, and Motown Records. Some of the songwriters popularized by The 5th Dimension went on to careers of their own, especially Ashford & Simpson, who wrote \"California Soul\". The group is also notable for having more success with the songs of Laura Nyro than Nyro did herself, particularly with \"Stoned Soul Picnic\", \"Sweet Blindness\", \"Wedding Bell Blues\", \"Blowin' Away\", and \"Save the Country\". The group also covered music by well known songwriters such as the song \"One Less Bell to Answer\", written by Burt Bacharach and Hal David and the songs and music of Jimmy Webb, who penned their hit \"Up, Up and Away\", including an entire recording of Webb songs called The Magic Garden. The 5th Dimension's famed producer, Bones Howe, utilized Bob Alcivar as the singers' vocal arranger, as well as The Wrecking Crew, a renowned group of studio musicians including drummer Hal Blaine, for their recording sessions."@en ;

Created as a short sketch in Idle's UK television comedy series Rutland Weekend Television, the Rutles gained fame after being the focus of the 1978 mockumentary television film, All You Need Is Cash (The Rutles). Actual Beatle George Harrison notably appeared in the film and assisted in its creation. Encouraged by the positive public reaction to the sketch, featuring Beatles' music pastiches by Innes, the film was written by Idle, who co-directed it with Gary Weis. It had 20 songs written by Innes, which he performed with three musicians as \"The Rutles\". A soundtrack album in 1978 was followed in 1996 by Archaeology, which spoofed the Beatles' Anthology series which had recently been released.

dbr:Four_Tops	rdf:type	dbo:Band ;
	dbo:abstract	"The Four Tops are an American vocal quartet from Detroit, Michigan who helped to define the city's Motown sound of the 1960s. The group's repertoire has included soul music, R&B, disco, adult contemporary, doo-wop, jazz, and show tunes. Founded as The Four Aims, lead singer Levi Stubbs, and groupmates Abdul \"Duke\" Fakir, Renaldo \"Obie\" Benson and Lawrence Payton remained together for over four decades, having gone from 1953 until 1997 without a change in personnel. The Four Tops were among a number of groups, including The Miracles, The Marvelettes, Martha and the Vandellas, The Temptations, and The Supremes, who established the Motown Sound around the world during the 1960s. They were notable for having Stubbs, a baritone, as their lead singer, whereas most male/mixed vocal groups of the time were fronted by a tenor. The group was the main male vocal group for the highly successful songwriting and production team of Holland\u2013Dozier\u2013Holland, who crafted a stream of hit singles on Motown. These included two Billboard Hot 100 number-one hits for the Tops: \"I Can't Help Myself (Sugar Pie Honey Bunch)\" in 1965 and \"Reach Out I'll Be There\" in 1966. After Holland-Dozier-Holland left Motown in 1967, the Four Tops were assigned to a number of producers, primarily Frank Wilson, but generally with less success. When Motown left Detroit in 1972 to move to Los Angeles, California, the Tops stayed in Detroit but signed a new recording deal with ABC Records' Dunhill imprint. Recording mainly in Los Angeles, they continued to have chart singles into the late 1970s, including the million-seller, \"Ain't No Woman\", their second release on Dunhill, produced by Steve Barri and composers Dennis Lambert and Brian Potter. In the 1980s, the Four Tops recorded for Casablanca Records, Arista Records and Motown, returning to that label on two occasions for brief stays. Apart from their Indestructible album (owned by Sony Music Entertainment), Universal Music Group controls the rights to their entire post-1963 catalog (through various mergers and acquisitions), as well as their 1956 single, \"Could It Be You\". A change of line-up was finally forced upon the group when Lawrence Payton died on June 20, 1997. The group initially continued as a three-piece under the name The Tops, before Theo Peoples (formerly of The Temptations) was recruited as the new fourth member. Peoples eventually took over the role of lead singer when Stubbs suffered a stroke in 2000, with Ronnie McNeir then joining the group. On July 1, 2005, Benson died of lung cancer with Payton's son Roquel Payton replacing him. Levi Stubbs died on October 17, 2008. Fakir, McNeir, Payton, and Harold \"Spike\" Bonhart, who replaced Peoples in 2011, are still performing together as the Four Tops. As of 2014, fifty years after their first Motown hit, Fakir is the only surviving founding member of the original group and Payton is a second-generation member."@en ;

A single, \"We Can Get It On\", was made available for radio play shortly before the album's release. However, the single did not have much commercial success. The album itself only sold around 2,000 copies. Rob & Fab did not record or release any further music. Over the next two years, the two stopped speaking to one another. Subsequently, Rob & Fab disbanded, and Taj Records soon went out of business. The 1993 Rob & Fab album was the last performance by Pilatus prior to his death in 1998. Morvan would not release another album until his 2003 solo work, Love Revolution."@en ;

Active between 1985 and 1995, these four artists recorded three major label albums as The Highwaymen: two on Columbia Records and one for Liberty Records. Their Columbia works produced three chart singles, including the Number One \"Highwayman\" in 1985. Between the years of 1997 and 1999, Nelson, Kristofferson, Cash, and Jennings also provided the voice and dramatization for the Louis L'Amour Collection, a four CD box set of seven Louis L'Amour stories published by the HighBridge Company, although the four were not credited as \"The Highwaymen\" in this work. Besides the four formal members of the group, only one recording vocal artist ever appeared on a Highwaymen recording: Johnny Rodriguez, who provided a Spanish vocal on 'Deportee', a Woody Guthrie cover, from \"Highwayman\"."@en ;

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Udora_(band)>	rdf:type	dbo:Band ;
	dbo:abstract	"Udora is a rock band originally from Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais, Brazil. Its members lived for five years in Los Angeles, California, USA and moved back to Brazil in 2006. The band was formed in 1997 by singer/guitarist Gustavo Drummond, drummer Jean Dolabella and bassist Ian Dolabella (Jean's brother) under the name Diesel and was one of the biggest names in the Belo Horizonte underground music scene. Shortly after guitarist Leo Marques joined and around 1999 Ian left the band for being contrary to the exposure they were having, being replaced by bassist Thiago Correa, nicknamed TC. In 2001, the band gained nationwide exposure after winning, through a battle of the bands-style contest, a spot on the main stage of the Rock in Rio 3 festival. They opened the last day of the festival, performing alongside bands like Deftones, Silverchair and the Red Hot Chili Peppers. In 2003, the band decided to move to Los Angeles in an attempt to break into the US market. The name Diesel was dropped to avoid conflict with Diesel jeans. After playing several shows in small local clubs, they were signed to the J Records label and went into the studio with producer Matt Wallace to record their first album as Udora, Liberty Square. However, after a lengthy tour of the US supporting former Alice in Chains guitarist Jerry Cantrell, J Records merged with RCA. The change in management was not well received by the band and they chose to sever their ties with the label. In 2006, singer/guitarist Gustavo Drummond announced that drummer Jean Dolabella was leaving the band, citing \"irreconcilable differences, both personal and musical\" as the motive of his departure. Due to Jean's departure, their tour in Brazil scheduled for May 2006 was canceled. A few months later, Dolabella joined Sepultura, replacing Igor Cavalera on drums. Drummond decided to return to Brazil and record a new Udora album with songs in Portuguese named Goodbye, Al\u00F4. He was joined by bassist Daniel Debarry, who replaced Thiago Correa, and drummer Paulo Henrique Braga, nicknamed PH. The band promoted the album throughout Brazil and got moderate radio airplay while signing a deal with major Brazilian record label Som Livre to re-release their first fully Portuguese work nationally. They enjoyed moderate success with songs being played on national TV teen shows such as Malha\u00E7\u00E3o, on Globo TV. Around 2009, Leo Marques left the band to pursue other musical goals and guitarist, songwriter and long time mate of Drummond's Marcelo Mercedo joined the band. Marcelo also co-wrote a few songs with Drummond on their Brazilian d\u00E9but Goodbye, Al\u00F4. With yet another lineup, the band regrouped to record their fourth album, Belle \u00C9poque, heavily influenced by pop music and a dramatic departure from their first work as Diesel. The album took about 2 and a half years to be produced and recorded and was finally released on August 15, 2011. Although with a new work, the band decided not to launch a tour to support the album and are currently playing small but sparse gigs in their hometown Belo Horizonte. Gustavo Drummond is currently setting up to record his first solo effort, having already released a few demos on his MySpace. According to him, all songs are already written and ready to be recorded."@en ;

The Maines Brothers for which the band was named are Lloyd Maines (steel, rhythm, and electric guitar, vocals), Donnie Maines (percussion, vocals), Kenny Maines (lead vocals, bass guitar, harmonica), and Steve Maines (lead vocals, rhythm guitar). Other members of the band have included Jerry Brownlow, Randy Brownlow, Cary Banks, Richard Bowden, and LaTronda Maines. Terry Allen has collaborated with the band as well. The Maines Brothers Band got its start in the mid-1950s with James and Sonny Maines, father and uncle of the Lloyd/Donnie/Kenny/Steve combo that eventually formed the band. The younger group of brothers initially performed as \"The Little Maines Brothers Band\" before taking over the \"Maines Brothers Band\" moniker in the mid-1970s. The Maines family lived in and around Lubbock, Texas, and the band was based there. Several albums and tracks are named after the area, including \"Hub City Moan\" (1981 album and track) after Lubbock's nickname, the \"Hub City\"; \"Rt. 1 Acuff\" (1980 album) after Acuff, Texas, and \"Panhandle Dancer\" (1982 album) after the Texas Panhandle. In the mid-1980s the band recorded for Mercury/Polygram records and scored a top-20 Country hit in 1985 with \"Everybody Needs Love on Saturday Night\". The Maines Brothers Band performed a reunion set as an opening act for the Dixie Chicks (whose lead singer Natalie Maines is Lloyd Maines's daughter) at Lubbock's United Spirit Arena on August 6, 2000.

Formed in Ripley, Oklahoma in the early 1920s, the band was first known as McGinty's Oklahoma Cowboy Band, for the leader, Billy McGinty, a well-known cowboy, former Rough Rider, and world champion rider with Buffalo Bill's show. The band members were authentic cowboys from ranches in and around Ripley. Their first promoter, George Youngblood, introduced them saying, \"I wish to say of this bunch of cowboys that they are not only good fiddlers, but can ride or rope anything that has horns, hide or hair.\" After McGinty left to become the postmaster of Ripley, Otto Gray (1884\u20131967), took over as bandleader as well as manager. With the extensive traveling generated from their popularity, the original band member dropped out to stay with their jobs and families. Gray filled their places with professional musicians willing to spend most of their time on the road. Playing on the vaudeville circuits in the Midwest and Northeast, and nationwide over some 130 radio stations, they played the first cowboy music most Americans outside of the West had ever heard. One of their most popular tunes was \"Midnight Special\", performed by member Dave \"Pistol Pete\" Cutrell; Cutrell's \"Pistol Pete's Midnight Special\" with McGinty's band was also the first version of \"Midnight Special\" ever recorded. The band lasted until the early 1930s when economic situations led them to disband."@en ;

dbr:Feeder	rdf:type	dbo:Band ;
	dbo:abstract	"Feeder are a Welsh rock formed in Newport, Wales. Feeder has released eight studio albums, three compilations, two EPs, and 34 singles. They have spent a total of 180 weeks on the singles and albums charts combined as of 2012, and have accumulated 25 top 75 singles between 1997 and 2012. Feeder's music has been inspired by a wide variety of artists and styles, including The Police, Nirvana, and The Smashing Pumpkins. Their early material showcased a heavy rock sound reminiscent of grunge, but the band would later introduce more acoustic aspects into their music, including elements of pianos and string orchestras. The band was formed in 1992 under the name of \"Reel\" by vocalist and guitarist Grant Nicholas, drummer Jon Lee and bassist Simon Blight, three of the four members of Raindancer, after the departure of that band's other member, guitarist John Canham. However, Blight left Reel later in 1992, and the band played with many session bassists before hiring Taka Hirose in 1995, a year after the band signed with The Echo Label. Feeder garnered media attention in 2001 for their third album, Echo Park, and its lead single, \"Buck Rogers\", which later become a UK Top 5 single. In January 2002, Jon Lee committed suicide in his Miami home, after which the remaining members began to record and play with former Skunk Anansie drummer Mark Richardson. They released their fourth album, Comfort in Sound later that year, which touched on themes such as loss and coming to terms with death, while also exploring themes of positivity. Richardson was ultimately made an official member, remaining so until May 2009 when he returned to a reformed Skunk Anansie. Feeder employed Australian Damon Wilson and former Mexicolas drummer Tim Trotter for sessions and touring commitments for Renegades (2010), and they have since employed drummer Karl Brazil. Although the band have not had a top 10 release since 2008, they have still charted two more Top 20 albums, with the latest being 2012's Generation Freakshow."@en ;

While they were inspired by another Slovenian radical band Buldo\u017Eer known for utilizing sheer madness in the social and political satire, their lyrics is more self-ironic. The band was formed in Maribor in June 1979. Their name, meaning hungry Franz, is a pun on the name of a character from the novel Catch-22, Hungry Joe, and describes hunger for rock music. The band's music and attitude was a kind of laid back, and they portrayed themselves as a local band from a provincial town. Zoran Predin's lyrics ranged from disturbing ballads (Ne mi dihat za ovratnik, Lipa zelenela je), through love songs (\u010Cakaj me, Naj ti poljub nari\u0161e ustnice), to social and political satire (Praslovan, Na\u0161a Lidija je pri vojakih). The key band members were frontman and songwriter Zoran Predin, and guitarist Oto Rimele. The band made the most creative success by the end of the 1980s, with classical albums such as Ikebana, Adijo pamet, Ne mi dihat za ovratnik, and Na svoji strani (the last one made with the original crew). Their last studio album was released in 1994. La\u010Dni Franz officially ceased to exist in 1997 after a series of compilation albums. Zoran Predin continued solo career after the Franz disbanded. Many band's hits, such as Praslovan, Bog nima telefona, Vaterpolist, Ne mi dihat za ovratnik, \u010Cakaj me or Naj ti poljub nari\u0161e ustnice, have remained in his concert repertoire.

Former Nothing But Happiness and Crash guitarist Ralske started Ultra Vivid Scene in 1987, was signed to 4AD Records in 1988, and released his first UVS EP, She Screamed, in 1988.

The second album, Joy 1967-1990, was released in April 1990. The same month they played their first tour dates in the United Kingdom. The last album, Rev, was released in October 1992, and was performed by a band comprising Julius Klepacz (drums) and Jack Daley (bass) with Ralske on vocals and guitar. This album was picked up by the Chaos imprint of Columbia Records (Sony Music Distribution) during the time rival Warner Bros. was having some success with its imprints' 4AD relationships (4AD/Sire, 4AD/Elektra, 4AD/Reprise). As a live act, Ultra Vivid Scene performed only a handful of US dates in support of the first album in 1989. The second album in 1990 was supported by one month of touring in Europe and two months in the US. 1993 saw one month of US tour dates for the third and final album. Ralske has gone on to do solo work, and has also produced albums for such artists as Rasputina, Ivy and Charles Douglas. His last known musical endeavor was the solo release in 2001 Amor 0 + 01. Since that time, Ralske has worked as a visual artist."@en ;

It was India's first rock band. It is difficult to classify them into a musical genre, as their music was a mixture of a wide variety of influences, including the Baul and folk traditions of Bengali and rock, loosely it can be called folk rock. Established in the 1970s during a period of stagnation in Bengali music, when commercial film songs were the dominant market force, the lyrics (and to some extent the compositions) of leader Gautam Chattopadhyay were radically new. They were of a very personal or social nature, similar to the urban folk movement led by Bob Dylan in the 60s. Though they were almost unknown in their time, in recent years they have undergone a critical re-evaluation much like the Velvet Underground. In recognition of this renewed interest, Gautam released a compilation of Mohiner Ghoraguli covers by contemporary artists, Aabaar Bochhor Kuri Pore in 1995. They have since come to be considered an unrecognised pioneers of the jibonmukhi style and ethics, decades ahead of their times. They are sometimes also credited as the pioneers of the flourishing of Bengali bands in the new millennium. This is debatable as their songwriting was strongly rooted in Bengali folk and also American urban folk, while modern Bengali bands like Fossils and Insomnia are influenced by grunge. Their signature song is Prithibita Naki (\u09AA\u09C3\u09A5\u09BF\u09AC\u09C0\u099F\u09BE \u09A8\u09BE\u0995\u09BF), a reflection on how television creates urban alienation.

dbr:The_Kinks	rdf:type	dbo:Band ;
	dbo:abstract	"The Kinks were an English rock band formed in Muswell Hill, North London, in 1963 by brothers Dave and Ray Davies. They are regarded as one of the most important and influential rock groups of the era. The band emerged in 1964 during the height of British rhythm and blues and Merseybeat, and were briefly part of the British Invasion of the US until their touring ban in 1965. Their third single, the Ray Davies penned \"You Really Got Me\", became an international hit, topping the charts in the United Kingdom and reaching the Top 10 in the United States. Between the mid-1960s and early 1970s, the group released a string of hit singles; studio albums drew good reviews but sold less than compilations of their singles. They gained a reputation for reflecting English culture and lifestyle, fuelled by Ray Davies' observational writing style. Albums such as Face to Face, Something Else, The Kinks Are the Village Green Preservation Society, Arthur, Lola Versus Powerman and the Moneygoround and Muswell Hillbillies, along with their accompanying singles, are considered among the most influential recordings of the period. After a fallow period in the mid Seventies, the band experienced a revival during the late 1970s and early 1980s with albums Sleepwalker, Misfits, Low Budget, Give the People What They Want and State of Confusion. In addition, groups such as Van Halen, the Jam, the Knack, the Pretenders and the Fall covered their songs, helping to boost the Kinks' record sales. In the 1990s, Britpop acts such as Blur and Oasis cited the band as a major influence. The Kinks broke up in 1996, a result of the commercial failures of their last few albums and creative tension between the Davies brothers. Their music was influenced by a wide range of genres, including rhythm and blues, British music hall, folk and country. Ray Davies (lead vocals, rhythm guitar) and Dave Davies (lead guitar, vocals) remained members throughout the group's 32-year run. Longest serving member Mick Avory (drums and percussion) was replaced by Bob Henrit formerly of Argent in 1984. Original bassist Pete Quaife was replaced by John Dalton in 1969 and Dalton was in turn replaced by Jim Rodford in 1978. Session keyboardist Nicky Hopkins accompanied the band in the studio for many of their recordings in the mid-late 1960s. In 1969 keyboardist John Gosling joined the band, making them an official five-piece, while Ian Gibbons replaced him in 1979, playing in the band until its eventual demise. The group had five Top 10 singles on the US Billboard chart. Nine of their albums charted in the Top 40. In the UK, the group had seventeen Top 20 singles and five Top 10 albums. Four of their albums have been certified gold by the RIAA. Among numerous honours, they received the Ivor Novello Award for \"Outstanding Service to British Music\". In 1990, the original four members of the Kinks were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, as well as the UK Music Hall of Fame in November 2005."@en ;

dbr:Chick_Corea_Elektric_Band	rdf:type	dbo:Band ;
	dbo:abstract	"Chick Corea Elektric Band is a jazz fusion band, led by pianist Chick Corea. Following the demise of Return to Forever, Corea established the musical ensemble in 1986. Following a long hiatus, the band reunited to produce To the Stars in 2004. The band's debut album can be described as \"jazz-rock\", though it is much closer to traditional jazz than the jazz-rock albums of the 1970s. The keyboard sounds on the album are typical for the mid-1980s. The drums played by Dave Weckl dominate the album's sound, with the guitar duties split between Scott Henderson and Carlos Rios. The second album, Light Years (1987) is more funk-oriented than its predecessor. Saxophonist Eric Marienthal joins the band and Frank Gambale replaces Henderson and Rios (who still plays on some tracks) to form what is considered the band's definitive lineup. The third album, Eye of the Beholder, relies on softer sounds. Here Corea relies on acoustic piano, with synthesizers largely in the background. Gambale also plays acoustic guitar on some tracks, lending a Flamenco-influenced sound to pieces like \"Eternal Child.\" The Elektric Band's fourth album, Inside Out (1990), features some compositions that fall in the post-bop rather than the fusion category. The four-part piece \"Tale of Daring\", which closes the album, relies on unconventional melodies and relatively free improvisation. But two other compositions, the title track and \"Kicker,\" are more traditional fusion pieces. Corea still uses mostly acoustic piano, but Gambale plays electric guitar throughout. The last album featuring the band's traditional lineup was Beneath the Mask (1991), a return to the electric jazz-funk of the second album. For the next album, Elektric Band II: Paint the World (1993), only Corea and Marienthal returned from the original lineup. Gary Novak became the new drummer, Jimmy Earl took the bass, and Mike Miller played guitar. The album's style can be described as modern jazz, crossing between post-bop and fusion. In 1996, the band teamed up with Steve Vai's Monsters to record a version of \"Rumble\" from West Side Story for the RCA Victor tribute album called The Songs of West Side Story. The original members reunited in 2004 for To the Stars (2004), which is stylistically close to the avant-garde and post-bop on Inside Out. After the final studio album the band has toured also with Victor Wooten who has replaced Patitucci."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"The Greyboy Allstars are a jazz band who released their fourth album, Inland Emperor, in 2013. The band came together in 1994, when a select group of musicians were asked to perform at a record release party for the landmark acid jazz and club staple \u201CFreestylin\u201D by San Diego\u2019s DJ Greyboy, who was well known for spinning `70s soul and funk. The group enjoyed playing together, and decided to continue on as a band. The Greyboy Allstars started playing weekly at San Diego\u2019s now defunct Green Circle, weekends at San Francisco\u2019s Elbo Room and various clubs throughout Europe. By playing danceable boogaloo music within the soul and jazz genres, they became very popular both nationally and internationally. The lineup of the band remains nearly the same, with Karl Denson on horns and vocals, Robert Walter on keyboards, Elgin Park (aka Michael Andrews) on guitars and vocals, and Chris Stillwell on bass. Original drummer Zak Najor was replaced by Aaron Redfield, an old friend of the band and frequent collaborator. While DJ Greyboy is no longer a member of the band, he remains a central figure in their artistic output, having introduced the band to many of the records that inspire their sound, produced their first album and appeared on 2007\u2032s What Happened to Television? Individual members of the group have gone on to score film and television shows, work with platinum artists and bands both on the road and in the studio, and head their own solo projects.[citation needed] For Inland Emperor, they worked out the arrangements during the recording, which took place live over just a few sessions at Elgin Park\u2019s studio in Glendale, CA. Denson says of this accelerated pace of creation, \u201CWe do in one week would take me two months to do in any other situation.\u201D Grammy Award-winning producer/engineer Mickey Petralia (Beck, Peaches, Eels, Flight of the Conchords) mixed the tracks."@en ;

dbr:Army_of_the_Pharaohs	rdf:type	dbo:Band ;
	dbo:abstract	"Army of the Pharaohs (most commonly abbreviated as AOTP or A.O.T.P.) is an American underground hip hop collective originating from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, formed by Jedi Mind Tricks MC Vinnie Paz in 1998. The group has strong links to other underground groups such as; OuterSpace, Snowgoons, La Coka Nostra, Demigodz and Jedi Mind Tricks. It has changed several times ever since its formation. Paz formed the outfit in the late 1990s with the original roster of Bahamadia, Chief Kamachi, Virtuoso, 7L & Esoteric, plus Jedi Mind Tricks' other member Stoupe the Enemy of Mankind. The group first released the \"Five Perfect Exertions\" and \"War Ensemble\" 12\" on Paz's short-lived Recordings in 1998, but then the underground supergroup remained silent for several years. After a couple of successful Jedi Mind Tricks albums and a new deal with Babygrande by 2003, Paz resurrected the crew, adding OuterSpace, Celph Titled, Reef the Lost Cauze, King Syze, Des Devious, and Apathy; however, Stoupe, Bahamadia, and Virtuoso had defected from the group. Babygrande issued their \"Tear It Down\" 12\" and first album, The Torture Papers, in 2006. The 2007 follow-up album, Ritual of Battle, saw Jus Allah and JMT prot\u00E9g\u00E9s Doap Nixon and Demoz joining the Pharaohs. The Unholy Terror was released on March 30, 2010. This album marked the return of Apathy and the addition of two new AOTP members, Block McCloud Journalist. Two songs, \"Godzilla\" and \"Contra Mantra\", were released before the album. This album also marked the departure of Chief Kamachi who left the group because of business issues and an apparent feud with Vinnie Paz & Apathy. In early 2011, Vinnie Paz announced on his Facebook page that In Death Reborn is due to be released in 2012, however the date was pushed back and almost seemed like it was never going to be released. Early in 2012, Houston underground MC Zilla and Connecticut's Blacastan were added to the group. Both artists have made names for themselves with their features and album releases in 2012. In Death Reborn was eventually released on April 22, 2014. The album featured members Vinnie Paz, Apathy, Blacastan, Block McCloud, Celph Titled, Demoz, Des Devious, Doap Nixon, Esoteric, Lawrence Arnell, King Magnetic, King Syze, OuterSpace, Reef the Lost Cauze and Zilla. Their fifth studio album, Heavy Lies the Crown was released on October 21, 2014."@en ;

The project's first EP, V\u00EAn, was released in 2003. V\u00EAn was a studio project of Glanzmann's, but its success led to the recruitment of a full band. The band then released a full-length album, Spirit, in June 2006. In November 2007, Eluveitie was signed by Nuclear Blast. The group rose to fame following the release of their first major-label album, Slania, in February 2008. The album peaked at number 35 in the Swiss charts and number 72 in the German charts. Eluveitie describe themselves as \"The new wave of folk metal\". The band's style incorporates characteristics of melodic death metal combined with the melodies of traditional Celtic music. They use traditional European instruments, including the hurdy-gurdy and bagpipes, amidst guitars and both clean and harsh vocals. Their lyrics include references to Celtic mythology, particularly the Celtic Gaul village. The lyrics are often in the extinct ancient language Gaulish. The name of the band comes from graffiti on a vessel from Mantua (ca. 300 BC). The inscription in Etruscan letters reads eluveitie, which has been interpreted as the Etruscan form of the Celtic (h)elvetios (\u201Cthe Helvetian\u201D), presumably referring to a man of Helvetian descent living in Mantua."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Josh Joplin Group was an American Georgia-based folk rock band led by singer-songwriter Josh Joplin. Joplin brought the group its trademark combination of introspective lyrics, catchy melodies, and lead vocals that, to many, sound identical to those of R.E.M. singer Michael Stipe (to the point that one Joplin song, \"Happy at Last,\" begins, \"I sound like Michael Stipe and I dream like Carl Jung\"). After releasing two independent albums - Projector Head and Boxing Nostalgic - under the name Josh Joplin Band, the group signed to Artemis Records and released Useful Music in 2001. Produced largely by Shawn Mullins, the album received strong reviews but failed to make much commercial impact. It did, however, spawn a mild hit in \"Camera One,\". Featuring a more rock-edged, radio-friendly sound than most of the material on Useful Music, the song peaked at #22 on the Billboard Adult Top 40 chart in 2001, and was featured in an episode of the comedy series Scrubs (season 1, episode 7, \"My Super Ego\"). In September 2002, Josh Joplin Group released its second major-label album, The Future That Was. On this record, Joplin's lyrics were noticeably more clever and playful than on Useful Music, with subject matter including the nature of popularity (\"The Wonderful Ones\"), the absurdity of snobbery among music lovers (\"It's Only Entertainment\"), and the uselessness of trying to predict the future (\"The Future That Was\"). The musical styles were similarly varied, ranging from slow piano- and acoustic guitar-driven pop to upbeat keyboard- and electric guitar-based rock. Like its predecessor, The Future That Was received critical acclaim but sold poorly. Artemis released two singles from the album, \"I Am Not the Only Cowboy\" and \"Wonder Wheel,\" but neither one took off. In the fall of 2003, the band announced that it was breaking up and would play its final two shows in Atlanta in December of that year."@en ;

The band currently resides in Hollywood, California, and is led by vocalist Marshall Goppert under the stage name Nero Bellum. While their early efforts are generally categorized as aggrotech, later releases incorporated a disparate set of musical and aesthetic influences, notably black metal and industrial metal. They belonged to the so-called \u201Csecond wave\u201D of American harsh EBM, along with bands such as Dawn of Ashes, Die Sektor, and Tactical Sekt. The group went on their first hiatus at the end of 2010 due to Bellum\u2019s opiate addiction, but returned to the stage in October 2011 for a performance in New York and released their last album Order of the Shadow: Act 1 in 2013.

	dbo:abstract	"Attacco Decente were a musical group from Brighton, England, active from 1984 to 1996. The band was notable for using unusual acoustic instruments such as hammered dulcimers, Appalachian dulcimers, and tongue drums alongside more conventional instruments such as acoustic guitar and acoustic bass guitar. Their founder member and sole constant was Geoff Smith. Their lyrics, written by Smith, reflected a strong socialist political stance, especially on the early singles and the first album. Although the band were active at the height of Thatcherism, they did not participate in the more moderate Red Wedge collective. The band's first single, \"Trojan Horse\", featured Smith and Graham Barlow. Acoustic guitarist and backing vocalist Mark Allen joined and they released a 12\" EP, \"U.K.A. (United Kingdom of America)\", the sleeve of which featured an endorsement from Billy Bragg. The band released their debut album, The Baby Within Us Marches On, in 1988. Barlow left after the release of the \"I Don't Care How Long It Takes\" single. Smith and Allen recorded the band's second and last album, Crystal Night, as a duo. The band's sound changed somewhat in this incarnation, with the heavily percussive sound of the trio line-up replaced by a mellower, folky feel. There was less emphasis on the tongue drums and more on the hammered dulcimer and Allen's guitar, which took on a markedly flamenco aspect. Smith's lyrics became less overtly political, and more concerned with love and personal relationships. The band split after the Crystal Night album. Smith continued as a solo performer and composer, creating music for film and dance. Allen is now a teacher, but has also continued to work as a singer and guitarist in a number of groups."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"The Spiders from Mars were rock singer David Bowie's backing band in the early 1970s, and consisted of Mick Ronson on guitars, Trevor Bolder on bass guitar, and Mick Woodmansey on drums. The group had its origins in Bowie's earlier backing outfit the Hype, which featured Ronson and Woodmansey, but Tony Visconti on bass. They were briefly signed as a band on its own, known as Ronno. With Bolder taking over bass, they were subsequently named via the landmark 1972 Bowie concept album The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars and were billed as such on the accompanying large-scale Ziggy Stardust Tour. They were present again on Bowie's 1973 album Aladdin Sane. Another leg of the tour followed that year, with the final show captured in the film Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars. The group joined Bowie in the theatrical style of the material's presentation. Ronson's guitar and arranging during the Spiders from Mars era not only fit into this style, but also provided much of the underpinning for later punk rock musicians. In 1975 Bolder and Woodmansey reformed the band without Ronson, and were joined in this lineup by Mike Garson, Dave Black, Pete McDonald. Their self-titled album, released in 1976, was their only album before the group disbanded. The name came from the famous UFO sighting where a stadium crowd thought they had witnessed Martian spacecraft which turned out to be migrating spiders and not from the Martian areographic features often labelled as 'spiders' and 'baby spiders.'"@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"The Whooliganz were a 1990s hip hop music duo consisting of Scott Caan and Alan Maman (the latter of whom is known now as hip hop producer The Alchemist). The duo went by the names Mad Skillz and Mudfoot, respectively. Caan and Maman met as teenagers in the wealthy neighborhood of Beverly Hills, California. The duo began performing throughout the Los Angeles area and gained recognition. Maman's childhood friend Evidence introduced the group to Quincy Jones III and they began work on a demo. They eventually caught the attention of B-Real of Cypress Hill, who invited the teens to join the collective Soul Assassins, which also consisted of Cypress Hill, House of Pain and Funkdoobiest. The Whooliganz toured the country with the Soul Assassins and their connection helped them land a record deal with Tommy Boy Records. The Whooliganz recorded their debut album, Make Way for the W, and the album's first single was \"Put Your Handz Up\", produced by DJ Lethal and released in 1993. But the single and music video did not receive much airplay. A second single, \"Don't Mean Nothin',\" was planned but then Tommy Boy decided to drop the group and not release the album. Another song, \"Whooliganz,\" was released as a single in 1995 in the UK on Positiva/EMI Records, but the duo had already gone its separate ways. Caan followed his father, James Caan, into a successful acting career. Maman turned to making beats and became a rapper and a successful and very well known producer under the stage name The Alchemist."@en ;

Founded in late 1996 by Skiba, bassist Rob Doran, and drummer Glenn Porter, Alkaline Trio released its debut single, \"Sundials\", in 1997. Following its release, Doran departed from the band and was replaced by Dan Andriano. The band subsequently recorded an EP, For Your Lungs Only (1998), and its debut studio album, Goddamnit (1998). Following the release of the band's second album, Maybe I'll Catch Fire (2000), Porter left the band and was replaced by Mike Felumlee for its subsequent album, From Here to Infirmary (2001). Backed by the singles \"Stupid Kid\" and \"Private Eye\", From Here to Infirmary significantly increased the band's exposure, and its follow-up, Good Mourning (2003), charted highly on the Billboard 200. Good Mourning marked the recording debut of current drummer Derek Grant. In 2005, the band released Crimson which expanded upon the band's punk rock influences, with prominent overdubs and additional instrumentation, and continued with this direction on Agony & Irony (2008), which was released on V2 Records. In 2010, the band released This Addiction on its own label Heart & Skull and Epitaph. Recorded in the band's home town of Chicago, with early producer Matt Allison, the album was a conscious effort by the band to return to their punk rock roots; it became the highest charting album of their career, debuting on the Billboard 200 at No. 11. In 2011, the band celebrated its 15-year anniversary with the release of Damnesia, which featured new, acoustic-based recordings of songs from across the band's career. The band's eighth studio album, My Shame Is True, was released on April 2, 2013."@en ;

Critics first described Audioslave as a combination of Soundgarden and Rage Against the Machine, but by the band's second album, Out of Exile, it was noted that they had established a separate identity. Audioslave's trademark sound was created by blending 1970s hard rock with 1990s alternative rock. Moreover, Morello incorporated his well-known, unconventional guitar solos into the mix. As with Rage Against the Machine, the band prided themselves on the fact that all sounds on their albums were produced using only guitar, bass, drums, and vocals. In its six years of existence, Audioslave released three albums, received three Grammy nominations, and became the first American rock band to perform an open-air concert in Cuba. Audioslave disbanded in February 2007 when Cornell issued a statement announcing that he was permanently leaving the band \"due to irresolvable personality conflicts as well as musical differences.\" The 2007 Rage Against the Machine reunion and tour involving the rest of the band as well as solo albums released that same year by Morello and Cornell cemented the supergroup's permanent demise."@en ;

Created following the McCartneys' 1971 album Ram, the band's first two albums, Wild Life and Red Rose Speedway (the latter featuring guitarist Henry McCullough), were viewed as artistic disappointments beside Paul McCartney's work with the Beatles. After the release of the title track of the James Bond movie Live and Let Die, McCullough and Seiwell resigned from the band. The McCartneys and Laine then released 1973's Band on the Run, a commercial and critical success that spawned two top ten singles in \"Jet\" and the title track. Following that album, the band recruited guitarist Jimmy McCulloch and drummer Geoff Britton, only for Britton to quit shortly afterwards and be replaced by Joe English. With the new line-up, Wings released Venus and Mars, which included the US number one single \"Listen to What the Man Said\", and undertook a highly successful world tour over 1975\u201376. Intended as more of a group effort, Wings at the Speed of Sound was issued midway through the tour and featured the hit singles \"Silly Love Songs\" and \"Let 'Em In\". In 1977, the band earned their only UK number one single, with \"Mull of Kintyre\", which became the then-best selling UK single in history. Wings experienced another line-up shuffle, however, with both McCulloch and English departing before the release of the group's 1978 album London Town. The McCartneys and Laine again added new members, recruiting guitarist Laurence Juber and drummer Steve Holley. The resulting album, Back to the Egg, was a relative flop, with its singles under-performing and the critical reception negative. During the supporting tour, Paul McCartney was arrested in Japan for cannabis possession, putting the band on hold. Despite a final US number one, the live version of McCartney's solo single \"Coming Up\", Wings broke up permanently in 1981."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Screaming Trees was an American rock band formed in Ellensburg, Washington in 1985 by vocalist Mark Lanegan, guitarist Gary Lee Conner, bass player Van Conner and drummer Mark Pickerel. Pickerel had been replaced by Barrett Martin by the time the band reached its most successful period. Although widely associated with grunge, the band's sound incorporated hard rock and psychedelic elements. Since its formation, Screaming Trees released seven studio albums, five EPs and three compilations. Screaming Trees is known as one of the \"Godfathers of Grunge\" along with the Melvins, Mudhoney, U-Men, Skin Yard, Soundgarden, Green River, Cosmic Psychos and Malfunkshun.[citation needed] Screaming Trees rose to fame as part of the grunge movement of the early 1990s, along with bands such as Alice in Chains, Pearl Jam, Nirvana and Soundgarden and was one of the most successful underground music acts of the 1990s. The band achieved one top ten single on the Modern Rock Tracks charts. Screaming Trees were plagued by extended inactivity due to their problems with making a follow up to Dust. This led to their official breakup in 2000."@en ;

dbr:Slade	rdf:type	dbo:Band ;
	dbo:abstract	"Slade (originally known as The N'Betweens and now Slade II) are an English glam rock band from Wolverhampton/Walsall. They rose to prominence during the early 1970s with 17 consecutive top 20 hits and six number ones. The British Hit Singles & Albums names them as the most successful British group of the 1970s based on sales of singles. They were the first act to achieve three singles enter at number one; all six of the band's chart-toppers were penned by Noddy Holder and Jim Lea. Total UK sales stand at 6,520,171, and their best-selling single, \"Merry Xmas Everybody\", has sold in excess of one million copies. Following an unsuccessful move to the United States in 1975, Slade's popularity waned but was unexpectedly revived in 1980 when they were last minute replacements for Ozzy Osbourne at the Reading Rock Festival. The band later acknowledged this to have been one of the highlights of their career. The original line up split in 1992 but the band reformed the following year as Slade II. The band has continued, with a number of line-up changes, to the present day. They have now shortened the group name back to Slade. A number of diverse artists have cited Slade as an influence, including alternative rock icons Nirvana and the Smashing Pumpkins, punk pioneers the Ramones, Sex Pistols, the Undertones, the Runaways and the Clash, glam metal bands Kiss, M\u00F6tley Cr\u00FCe, Twisted Sister, Quiet Riot, Poison and Def Leppard and pop-rock stalwarts the Replacements, Cheap Trick and Oasis. The Illustrated Encyclopaedia of Music tells of Holder's powerful vocals, guitarist Dave Hill's equally arresting dress sense and the deliberate misspelling of their song titles for which they became well known."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Dschinghis Khan (known in some countries as Genghis Khan) is a primarily German-language pop band originally formed in 1979 to compete in the Eurovision Song Contest. Steve Bender and Wolfgang Heichel were the only Germans in the group. Louis Hendrik Potgieter was South African, Henriette Heichel was Dutch, and Leslie M\u00E1ndoki and Edina Pop were Hungarian. The group's name was taken from the title of their song, \"Dschinghis Khan\", which was written and produced by Ralph Siegel with lyrics by Bernd Meinunger. In 1980, their single \"Moscow\" (the English-language version of \"Moskau\") topped the charts in Australia and remained No. 1 for six weeks. Its success there had much to do with the Seven Network's use of the song as the theme music for their television coverage of the 1980 Summer Olympics. The Australian single was issued in a die-cut Channel 7 sleeve. In an interview with Russian television presenter Alexandra Glotova, the producer of the group Dschinghis Khan, Heinz Gross, said that in the 1980s, the band was forbidden in the Soviet Union and was accused of anti-communism and nationalism. While the group broke up in the mid-1980s, the German video for \"Moskau\" was a part of the show Disco on ZDF, as was the similarly-staged \"Dschinghis Khan\". 1986 saw a brief reunion as Dschinghis Khan Family. Only Henriette Heichel (vocals), Leslie M\u00E1ndoki (drums) and Louis Potgieter (keyboards) returned from the original lineup. The song \"Wir geh\u00F6r'n zusammen\" led them to a national qualifying round of the Eurovision Song Contest, where they finished in second place. In 1988, Leslie M\u00E1ndoki and \u00C9va Csepregi, the vocalist of Hungarian pop group Neoton Fam\u00EDlia, sang the song \"Korea\" on the opening of the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul. Dancer and front man Louis Potgieter died of AIDS in 1993, while singer Karl-Heinz \"Steve\" Bender died from cancer in 2006."@en ;

The band was one of the most popular and most influential acts of the Yugoslav rock scene. Riblja \u010Corba was formed in 1978 by vocalist Bora \u0110or\u0111evi\u0107, guitarist Rajko Koji\u0107, bass guitarist Mi\u0161a Aleksi\u0107 and drummer Vicko Milatovi\u0107. Their debut release, the single \"Lutka sa naslovne strane\" (1978), saw huge success and launched them to fame. They were soon joined by guitarist Mom\u010Dilo Bajagi\u0107 \"Bajaga\", the new lineup releasing the album Kost u grlu (1979), which was, largely due to \u0110or\u0111evi\u0107's social-related lyrics, a huge commercial and critical success. Their following releases, Pokvarena ma\u0161ta i prljave strasti (1981), Mrtva priroda (1981) and Buvlja pijaca (1982) launched them to the top of the Yugoslav rock scene; \u0110or\u0111evi\u0107's provocative social- and political-related lyrics were praised by the critics and often caused media scandals. In the mid 1980s, the band saw a slight decline in popularity, but made a triumphant comeback with the album Istina (1985), recorded with new guitar duo, Vidoja \"D\u017Eind\u017Eer\" Bo\u017Einovi\u0107 and Nikola \u010Cuturilo. Until the end of the decade and breakup of Yugoslavia, the band managed to sustain their popularity, but after the beginning of Yugoslav wars it heavily declined in Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina, due to \u0110or\u0111evi\u0107's support for Serbian nationalism. However, \u0110or\u0111evi\u0107 also opposed the regime of Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107, demonstrating his attitude on the albums Riblja \u010Corba recorded during the 1990s. Since the beginning of the 2000s, the band manages to remain one of the top acts of the Serbian rock scene, although the albums they released during the 2000s and 2010s saw little critical success."@en ;

Spaeth left the band due to internal conflicts with Simmonds and started the band Clockmaker. The position was filled by guitarist Paul Enzio in time for 1992's Songs for Insects, their Metal Blade Records debut. This was followed up by Mods Carve the Pig: Assassins, Toads and God's Flesh. 1996's Outer Space Is Just a Martini Away subsequently saw a significant change in the band's sound and lineup when Donaldson was replaced by Jared Bryant. Oberlin switched to guitar and bassist Herb Ledbetter was added. Thought Industry continued to strip down their lineup and sound with 1997's moody Black Umbrella, which saw the departure of Lee. Bryant, Enzio and Ledbetter also left the band in 1999 which prompted Oberlin to assemble an entirely new lineup for 2001's magnum opus Short Wave on a Cold Day. Engineer Mike Roche, who recorded Thought Industry's Black Umbrella and Fred Thompson Trio's \"Scary Halloween Sound Effects\" and filled in on bass from time to time, was added as a full-time guitarist along with drummer Cameron Taylor, bassist Mark Baldwin and guitarist Jeff Borkowski."@en ;

Since its inception, the band's line-up has comprised Eddie Vedder (lead vocals), Mike McCready (lead guitar), Stone Gossard (rhythm guitar) and Jeff Ament (bass). The band's fifth member is drummer Matt Cameron (also of Soundgarden), who has been with the band since 1998. Boom Gaspar (piano) has also been a session/touring member with the band since 2002. Drummers Dave Krusen, Matt Chamberlain, Dave Abbruzzese and Jack Irons are former members of the band. Formed after the demise of Gossard and Ament's previous band, Mother Love Bone, Pearl Jam broke into the mainstream with its debut album, Ten, in 1991. One of the key bands in the grunge movement of the early 1990s, over the course of the band's career, its members became noted for their refusal to adhere to traditional music industry practices, including refusing to make proper music videos or give interviews, and engaging in a much-publicized boycott of Ticketmaster. In 2006, Rolling Stone described the band as having \"spent much of the past decade deliberately tearing apart their own fame.\" To date, the band has sold nearly 32 million records in the U.S. and an estimated 60 million worldwide. Pearl Jam has outlasted and outsold many of its contemporaries from the alternative rock breakthrough of the early 1990s, and is considered one of the most influential bands of that decade. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic referred to Pearl Jam as \"the most popular American rock & roll band of the '90s.\""@en ;

It started out on the blogging platform Livejournal, but has now moved to its own dedicated website. The ACT-I-VATE collective features serialized graphic novels from over twenty-five hand-picked professional cartoonists (each of whom generally adds a new episode weekly), and is updated daily. ACT-I-VATE's artists are unpaid, and produce their work without editorial oversight. ACT-I-VATE is also free to view. In addition to the high-quality comics, the site is known for its vocal community of readers and the lengthy discussion threads between artist and reader. ACT-I-VATE debuted on February 1, 2006, with eight cartoonists, and added four more members on April 5, 2006. Since then, the collective has added new hand-picked cartoonists at a regular rate to achieve its current membership. ACT-I-VATE rose to prominence when many of its artists, including Haspiel, Michel Fiffe, Mike Cavallaro, Dan Goldman, and Nick Bertozzi, began to receive publishing deals. Haspiel and Fiffe's three-issue mini-series, Brawl, a \"creature romance double feature\" featuring Haspiel's \"Immortal\" (starring Billy Dogma) and Fiffe's \"Panorama,\" which both originated on ACT-I-VATE, was published by Image Comics in the Fall of 2007. Similarly, Parade (with Fireworks), by Mike Cavallaro, began on ACT-I-VATE, was first excerpted in New York Magazine, and later published by Image.

Their debut album, Coverdale/Page was released on 15 March 1993, reaching No. 4 in the UK and No. 5 on the US Billboard 200 chart. Five singles were released to promote the album: \"Pride and Joy\", \"Shake My Tree\", \"Take Me for a Little While\", \"Take a Look at Yourself\" and \"Over Now\". The album was certified Gold by the RIAA for sales of the LP, CD & Cassette in excess of 500,000 copies and eventually went Platinum. The album also received the official Japanese Sony Music in-house award for sales in excess of 150,000 copies in Japan as well as the EMI in-house sales award for sales in excess of 60,000 copies in the UK. It has been rumoured that Page collaborated with Coverdale in order to irk Page's former Led Zeppelin bandmate Robert Plant,[citation needed] who up to that point had been reluctant to reunite with Page. In interviews at the time, Plant expressed some derision at the guitarist's collaboration with Coverdale, referring to the project as \u2018David Cover-version\u2019. An American arena tour was planned for the summer of 1993, but after sluggish ticket sales the tour was scrapped in favour of a series of concerts in Japan, after which the partnership was dissolved.[citation needed] Page subsequently teamed up with Plant for an \"UnLedded\" MTV project and Coverdale returned to Whitesnake."@en ;

The group was conceived by record producer Igor Matviyenko, and initially consisted of Andrei Grigoriev-Apollonov, Kirill Andreev, and primary vocalist Igor Sorin. They performed under several names (such as \"Apollo-Soyuz\") before settling on \"Ivanushki International\", a name meant to represent their intended blend of Russian (\"Little Ivans\") and international influences, and itself written half in Cyrillic, half in the Latin alphabet, with the second word read as in English. Their debut album, \u041A\u043E\u043D\u0435\u0447\u043D\u043E \u043E\u043D (Konyechno on, Of Course It's Him), was released in 1996. It included three cover versions of songs from the 1980s \u2013 \"\u0412\u0441\u0435\u043B\u0435\u043D\u043D\u0430\u044F\" (Vselennaya, \"The Universe\"), originally performed by Alexander Ivanov, and \"\u0420\u043E\u043D\u0434\u043E\" (Rondo, \"Roundabout\"), \"\u042D\u0442\u0430\u0436\u0438\" (Etazhi, \"Levels\"), and \"\u041C\u0430\u043B\u0438\u043D\u0430\" (\"Malina\", \"Rasberry\") by the group Class. However, it contained several original songs, including the hits \"\u0422\u0443\u0447\u0438\" (Tuchi, \"Clouds\"), \"\u041A\u043E\u043B\u0435\u0447\u043A\u043E\" (Kolechko, \"The Ring\"), \"\u0413\u0434\u0435-\u0442\u043E\" (Gdye-to, \"Somewhere\"), and \"\u041E\u043D\u0430\" (Ona, \"She\"). A remixed version of the album followed one year later, Konyechno on remixed. The remixes were created by Lubeh keyboardist Igor Polonsky, Moral Code X keyboardist Konstantin Smirnov, and DJ Maxim Milyutenko. Alongside the remixed versions, the album contained the new hit \"\u041A\u0443\u043A\u043B\u0430\" (Kukla, \"Doll\") and a cover version of the Lubeh song \"\u0414\u0443\u0441\u044F\" (Dusya). Ivanushki's second studio album, \u0422\u0432\u043E\u0438 \u043F\u0438\u0441\u044C\u043C\u0430 (Tvoi pisma, Your Letters), released later in 1997, repeated the existing formula of original material and covers of past hits. It also included an audio letter from the group. Later that year, Igor Sorin left to pursue a solo career, and was replaced by Oleg Yakovlev, who had appeared in the music video for \"Doll\". Without Sorin, the group continued its string of successes, releasing its perhaps best known song \"\u0422\u043E\u043F\u043E\u043B\u0438\u043D\u044B\u0439 \u043F\u0443\u0445\" (Topoliny pukh, \"Poplar Fuzz\"), a number-one hit in the summer of 1998. On September 1, 1998, Sorin committed suicide, jumping from the window of his high-rise apartment, and died three days later. The following year, the group released \u0424\u0440\u0430\u0433\u043C\u0435\u043D\u0442\u044B \u0436\u0438\u0437\u043D\u0438 (Fragmenti iz zhizni, Fragments of Life), their tribute to him, which contained songs he had written prior to joining Ivanushki, as well as poems he had written, and a song dedicated to him, \"\u042F \u0442\u0435\u0431\u044F \u043D\u0438\u043A\u043E\u0433\u0434\u0430 \u043D\u0435 \u0437\u0430\u0431\u0443\u0434\u0443\" (Ya tyebya nikogda nye zabudu, \"I Will Never Forget You\"). Ivanushki released their first full album with Yakovlev as vocalist, \u041E\u0431 \u044D\u0442\u043E\u043C \u044F \u0431\u0443\u0434\u0443 \u043A\u0440\u0438\u0447\u0430\u0442\u044C \u0432\u0441\u044E \u043D\u043E\u0447\u044C (Ob etom ya budu krichat' vsyu noch, I'll Shout About This All Night ), in April 1999. Recorded from August to November the previous year, it also contained singles such as \"Topoliny pukh\" that had already been released.

	dbo:abstract	"Psihomodo Pop is a Croatian pop punk group. The band was formed in 1983 in Zagreb and has since achieved a somewhat cult following across the area of former Yugoslavia. Formed from the remnants of a band called Neron, Psihomodo Pop initially gained fame across former Yugoslavia in 1988 after the release of their debut album Godina zmaja (The Year of the Dragon). Nema nje was released as a single from the album and became a success due to the music video for the song being played by MTV. This gave Psihomodo Pop the distinction as the first Yugoslavian music act to have their music played on a major music television network. In 1990 the band released their second studio album Sexy magazin and set out on a relatively successful three-month tour across the former Soviet Union. That same year, for concerts in Ljubljana and Zagreb, the band was chosen as the opening act for The Ramones, a band that Psihomodo Pop cited as both a musical act they admire the most as well as their biggest influence. Late 1990 saw Psihomodo Pop abandon their plans for an extended tour in support of their new album due to the outbreak of hostilities leading up to the Croatian War of Independence. The band joined Hrvatski Band Aid (Croatian Band Aid), a project composed of many of Croatia's top music acts, to help create the patriotic song Moja Domovina (My Homeland) condemning the war. After the war and the breakup of Yugoslavia, the band continued their success in Croatia by releasing several commercially and critically acclaimed albums such as Srebrne svinje (Silver Pigs), which spawned the Porin award winning single Starfucker. In 2000, the band released Debakl (Debacle) which won another Porin, this time for Best Rock Album of the Year. The band's eighth and the most recent studio album is Jeee! Jeee! Jeee!, released in 2009."@en ;

The Psy'Aviah videoclip for their single \"Moments (feat. Suzi Q. Smith)\" got banned in 2009 by YouTube which spawned a reaction of disbelief and disapproval towards YouTube in both the press and in online communities. 2010 brought the third album of Psy'Aviah entitled Eclectric, produced by band member Yves Schelpe and mastered by Geert de Wilde of IC 434 in Antwerp. Their third album contained a mix of electric eclecticism, showcasing varying styles while retaining a constant hint of darkness. They invited guests such as Jean-Luc De Meyer of Front 242 fame to sing on the track Oph\u00E9lie, and Jennifer Parkin of Ayria who guested on the track Into The Game. The album Introspection / Extrospection is the band's latest and was released November 25, 2011. It again features a wild range of styles as on Eclectric, and includes a track with Swedish model and ex-Ashbury Heights singer Kari Berg, Dutch singer Lis van den Akker from Dutch act Misery as well as Belgian MC's MC D\u00E9\u00E9joohc\u00E9\u00E9 & Thomas C. Beerten. The album is their third to be released on Alfa Matrix records. The first single Ok (including the remix by M.I.K.E.) and the track SOS Overdose attracted a great deal of attention before the album was actually released. In 2012 A follow up to the album Introspection / Extrospection was released in the form of a DJ-EP Ok / Virtual Gods DJEP with remixes by NUDE, Jan Vervloet. The EP included a cappella versions and dub version of the songs.

From dark, wailing experimental folk in the beginning, the sound began to transform and grow, to where it is now compared to the work of Nick Cave, Swans, and Scott Walker. The group's work has been described as crossing a wide variety of genres and musical styles or traditions, and the band itself is considered highly unique among the modern neofolk and post-industrial scenes in Europe. The ingenuity and constructiveness of Spiritual Front's songs have gained them somewhat of a cult following since their formation in the late 1990s. The band originated in 1999 as a project fronted by Simone \"Hellvis\" Salvatori, a guitarist and singer from Italy. They have since worked extensively \u2014 both solo and with several other projects\u2014 on their musical output. The group has performed subsequent tours throughout Europe, eastern Europe and South America. Their song, The Gift of Life, appeared on the original score of the American slasher film Saw II, Jesus died in Las Vegas appeared in the American Television series 'Las Vegas'.

The group's primary aesthetic assertion posits that genre is \"obsolete\". Although often categorized as purveyors of noise music, TLASILA have been noted to pursue an unorthodox approach, \"construct(ing) songs around an overwhelming plethora of sonic detail, challenging the listener to engage with a surfeit of information,\" deliberately blurring \"the line between harsh metal-on-metal noise and abstract musique concr\u00E8te.\" Smith's lyrics \"distance\" the group \"from any potential peers,\" \"scanning like (they) came from some previously unearthed hermetic treatise.\" Its final album, The Cort\u00E8ge, was released Fan Death Records in 2011."@en ;

dbr:Much_the_Same	rdf:type	dbo:Band ;
	dbo:abstract	"Much the Same is a punk rock band from the suburbs of Chicago, Illinois, United States. Their style is based on the fast, melodic skate punk of the mid-to-late 1990s made popular by bands such as NOFX, Lagwagon, and No Use for a Name. The band began in 1999 under the name Don't Look Down and changed to Much The Same in 2001 after a legal dispute with the now-defunct New Jersey band Don't Look Down. They released Quitters Never Win on A-F Records in 2003 and Survive in 2006. The band announced their break-up on April 23, 2007 following their first and only European tour. They reunited for a final farewell performance on March 26, 2011 at Reggie's Rock Club in Chicago. The sold out show featured both fan favorite songs and a few the band rarely, if ever, played live. The band announced on March 30, 2015 that they have reunited with former Break the Silence drummer, Mike Ford, on drums and will play shows around the Chicago area."@en ;

dbr:Mind_over_Four	rdf:type	dbo:Band ;
	dbo:abstract	"Mind over Four (occasionally written as Mind over 4) was an American heavy metal music group based out of Orange County, California. They started life as a sort of psychedelic punk band but eventually began creating their own unique brand of fierce prog/metal. In interviews they often referred to their music as \"experimetal\". BNR Metal Pages describes them as \"occupy[ing] that gray area between metal and uncommercial hard rock, but with a quirkiness in the songwriting that makes them difficult to describe or categorize\". During the course of the band, they recorded six albums and brought their electrifying live show to 14 countries and many national U.S. tours. The band dissolved shortly after the release of their 1995 album, Empty Hands. Singer Spike Xavier went on to play bass in his brother's band Humble Gods. He also played bass for the funk/metal band Mindfunk and eventually founded Corporate Avenger with Mindfunk vocalist Pat Dubar. Mike Jensen toured with KMFDM as guitar player and later joined the short lived band Overbreaker. Mike has released solo material under the name of Michael Fordays. Rich Castillo released an eclectic mix of solo material ranging from Zappa influenced comedy to smooth jazz instrumentals. Mark Fullerton worked on the production side of the film industry in Los Angeles for 15 years before moving to Utah. He now plays drums in a classic rock cover band called Mesozoic. In the fall of 2014, MO4 was rumored to be in talks of recording a new CD. In the August 21, 1993 issue of Kerrang magazine, a review of Mind Over Four's The Goddess album read: \"At their best, they're untouchable, unbelievable, perhaps the metal discovery of the '90s...utter perfection\". On the back cover photo of the Pantera album Vulgar Display of Power, Phil Anselmo can be seen wearing one of the band's T-shirts."@en ;

The original line up consisted of former Australian Idol contestants, including season one finalist Paulini, season two contestant Ricki-Lee Coulter, season three winner Kate DeAraugo and runner-up Emily Williams. Young Divas released a cover of \"This Time I Know It's for Real\" to attract attention for the tour. The song peaked at number two on the ARIA Singles Chart and was certified platinum by the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA). A cover of \"Happenin' All Over Again\" was later released as their second single, which peaked at number nine and was certified gold. Due to their commercial success, Sony BMG decided that the Young Divas would record a full-length album of classic disco and pop covers titled, Young Divas, in November 2006. The album debuted at number four on the ARIA Albums Chart and was certified double platinum. In June 2007, Coulter parted ways with the group to resume her solo music career and was replaced by season four runner-up Jessica Mauboy.
