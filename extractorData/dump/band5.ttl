	dbo:abstract	"Box of Frogs was a band formed in 1983 by former members of The Yardbirds, who released their first album in 1984. The core group comsisted of Chris Dreja, Paul Samwell-Smith, and Jim McCarty. Vocals on their eponymous album were done by John Fiddler, formerly of Medicine Head and British Lions; on the second album Fiddler sang on five tracks with guests including Graham Parker, Ian Dury and Roger Chapman singing lead on the others. Many musicians guested on their albums (including Rory Gallagher, Earl Slick and Mark Feltham), with several tracks featuring Steve Hackett. Former Yardbirds guitarists Jeff Beck and Jimmy Page guested on their first and second albums respectively. The group formation and name were explained on the sticker affixed to original LP releases: \"On June 23, 1983, as part of London's historic Marquee Club's 25th Anniversary celebrations, three original Yardbirds -- Paul Samwell-Smith, Chris Dreja and Jim McCarty -- found themselves together on stage again. This same venue had been a regular nightspot for the legendary guitar-based blues-rock band that was the springboard for the likes of Clapton, Beck and Page.For Paul, Chris and Jim, the reunion made them realize they had to make more music in the Yardbirds' tradition. They added Medicine Head John Fiddler on vocals to form the nucleus of the band.On Christmas Eve 1983, Jeff Beck joined them at a recording session at a farmhouse south of London and added his unique touch to four of the tracks. As other old friends jumped into the sessions the idea for the group's new name came about. Now with a fresh spirit and basic rock and roll roots there is a new band from across the pond.\" The group showed promise on the first album of rock radio friendly tunes, featuring Jeff Beck. \"Back Where I Started\" was in the top ten in the U.S., and the album was a featured number one on college campuses. Plans were made for a U.S. tour, but it is alleged that Samwell-Smith, Dreja, and McCarty nixed the idea of the tour, much to John Fiddler's dismay. Jeff Beck, who along with Dzal Martin was considered as the lead guitarist for such a tour, was reportedly disgusted at his ex-bandmates' refusal to tour America. He took no part on the second album, \"Strange Land\" (1986) and Fiddler barely chose to do so before walking out. \"Asylum\" is one of the few songs Fiddler sang on, and was the only one featuring Page. The track Back Where I Started is regularly included in the set-list of the revived Yardbirds."@en ;

Fin.K.L won numerous music awards until its unofficial end in 2002, when all of the members pursued solo careers in different areas of entertainment.

The group's lineup is Juris Kulakovs (keyboard, compositions), Juris S\u0113j\u0101ns (bass, vocals), Leons S\u0113j\u0101ns (lead guitar), Ieva Akur\u0101tere (vocals), Raimonds Barta\u0161evics (vocals), Dainis Strazdi\u0146\u0161 (drums). At first, P\u0113rkons played two completely different kinds of music \u2013 instrumental classical music, and wild rock'n'roll bordering on hard rock. The band is better known for the latter. Their songs became the folklore of the youth, speaking about things nobody else dared to speak about. The band was for no expressed reason banned by the Soviet power in 1983. They continued to play as an ensemble of the kolkhoz \"Soviet Latvia\", careful not to mention the title P\u0113rkons again. In 1985, after a concert in Ogre, a group of teenagers demolished two train compartments. After this, the group was banned again immediately, even though it had nothing to do with the incident. (The concert, demolished train, and court trials were documented by Juris Podnieks in the film, Vai viegli b\u016Bt jaunam? (Is It Easy to Be Young). After a few more years, in 1987, they arrived to the song festival Liep\u0101jas dzintars (English: Amber of Liep\u0101ja) as the ensemble of the fishermen's kolkhoz \"Selga\". The texts of their music are at least as rebellious as the music itself, mostly written by M\u0101ris Melgalvs, one of the best known examples is Bal\u0101de par gulbi. The group has also performed Songs of Fredman by the Swedish 18th century song-poet Carl Michael Bellman."@en ;

The band has a history that predates even its current name. Brothers Kirk and Jordi Comstock made their first foray into music while in elementary school. By 1991, both were playing all-ages shows in and around their hometown of Lunenburg, Nova Scotia and it was only a matter of time before they would plant the seed of what would eventually become one of the Maritimes' biggest cult followings. Originally founded under the Madhat moniker, they recruited a bassist (one of nearly a half-dozen who would come and go until 2005) and released the independent EP Freak in 1993. This received the attention of local radio station CKBW who would feature the trio prominently through local programming bringing Madhat to a wider audience. 1995 would bring about Hardhitters, the band's second EP followed by Full Length in 1998, the boys' first full-length effort. The critical success of the latter elevated Madhat to a national audience. In 2005, Madhat renamed themselves Air Traffic Control. They released a new self-titled album on February 12, 2005 to critical acclaim and garnering a nomination for New Group of the Year at the Nova Scotia Music Week conference. The trio's opening track, 'Feel Proud' was selected as the title song for the Electronic Arts game Rugby 2005 and has been featured in the YTV series 15 Love, while 'People Watching' is featured in EA Sports' NHL 17."@en ;

Some songs have had videos directed by guitarist Pat Schulenburg, such as their most recent production \"Twister\". The band regularly tours the United Kingdom. The animations are available on Veitch's website and the band's site. The band's first official single was \"Twister\" as an iTunes exclusive, and they then released \"Love Me Like You Used To\" and \"Ninja\" as a double A-side single. Originally the MP3's of these tunes were available free, but these are new, fully re-recorded versions available for sale. The song \"Soupy George\" has also inspired fans of the band to turn up at gigs wearing soup cans (either real, empty tins of soup or artistic representations) on their heads. The band's debut album, Danger is Dangerous, was released in September 2008. In April 2013, singer Joel Veitch announced on Twitter that the band would no longer be playing live, due to \"kids and moves and stuff\"."@en ;

They make their first public appearance in M\u00E9rida, in the Bullfighting Arena of M\u00E9rida November 20, 1982. In Caracas they were an overwhelming success, enlivening parties and private shows. Then came the professionalization by recording several albums, performing on radio and television. They have toured in Spain, Germany, Portugal and the Caribbean countries. The \"ca\u00F1onera music\" is a musical style born in the capital of Venezuela in the early 20th century. It is the first urban musical expression in this country. It has many similarities with the Dixieland developed in New Orleans. The groups that play \"ca\u00F1onera\" music include several Venezuelan rhythms like the venezuelan merengue, a variant of the pasodoble, joropo, and Venezuelan waltz. Currently there are only two groups dedicated to preserving the traditional music of Caracas: Los Anta\u00F1os del Stadium (1946) and Los Ca\u00F1oneros. Their most recent record is Esta es Caracas (2012), a venezuelan merengue featuring some of the most important singers in Venezuela: Cecilia Todd, Horacio Blanco (lead vocal for the ska band Desorden Publico), Rams\u00E9s Meneses a.k.a.

	dbo:abstract	"Monkey Majik (stylised as MONKEY MAJIK) is a pop rock band formed in 2000 in Sendai, Japan. The band consists of Canadian brothers, Maynard Plant and Blaise Plant, each acting as lead vocalists and guitarists, and two Japanese members: Tax on drums, and Dick on bass. Monkey Majik is signed to Binyl Records, a subsidiary of Avex Records, and are managed by Edwards Entertainment Group. Due to the blend of Eastern and Western pop rock influences, Monkey Majik has often been referred to as a \"hybrid band\". Much of the band's music has been cross-promoted via television programs, commercials, and movies. They were chosen as \u201CGoodwill Ambassadors\u201D for the 80th anniversary of Canada-Japan relations. The band rose to mainstream success after the 2006 success of their singles, \"Fly\", and \"Around the World\", off of the album Thank You, eventually reaching the top Oricon charts and collaborating with major Japanese sensations such as m-flo and SEAMO. As of 2012, they have released seven studio albums, four EP's, three physical live albums, three digital live albums, and three compilation albums, and have certified five singles through the Recording Industry Association of Japan. Since the debut of Monkey Majik, Maynard and Blaise have both simultaneously worked solo ventures into the music industry to much acclaim: Maynard with blanc. and Blaise with The Alphabet Project, of which they have each released two studio albums thus far. They received much acclaim across Japan after their assisting hands-on with clean-up and rescue during the aftermath of the 2011 T\u014Dhoku earthquake and tsunami, which was later documented and broadcast by MTV Japan on a TV special surrounding their work. Since then, Monkey Majik has gained the attention of American rapper and musical entrepreneur, will.i.am, during his world travels sponsored by Intel. Blaise and will.i.am performed a special version of the Monkey Majik song, \"Watching You\", live in Sendai during a private event, during which performance, will.i.am incorporated a freestyle rap. As \"Goodwill Ambassadors\", the band often visits and tours throughout Canada, having performed a special acoustic session in Toronto under this title on February 19, 2012., Blaise has also performed special acoustic live sessions at the Ottawa Japanese \"natsu matsuri\", or summer festival. The band takes Sendai City of Tohoku as the main base."@en ;

The group's name means \"dead hand\", based on a traditional Portuguese nursery rhyme. They are generally considered to be one of the most important bands in the Portuguese rock scene and have since reached a cult status. Since the start of their career, their live concerts became famous for their intensity and dark mood, due to their signature alternative rock sound and the performance of vocalist Adolfo Lux\u00FAria Canibal (a pseudonym, meaning Adolph Cannibal Lust), known for occasional onstage theatrics and his gravelly voice, half-sung, half-spoken singing style. M\u00E3o Morta's music is quite difficult to categorize as they seem to incorporate a variety of genres; from punk rock, metal, to industrial and experimental. Their sound, combined with Adolfo's lyrics, reflects urban violence, a human search for pleasure, freedom and a critique of contemporary consumerist society, often with sarcastic humour."@en ;

The group is best known for their eclectic sampling, quirky lyrics, and their contributions to the evolution of the jazz rap and alternative hip hop subgenres. The members are Posdnuos, Dave and Maseo. The three formed the group in high school and caught the attention of producer Prince Paul with a demo tape of the song \"Plug Tunin'\". With its playful wordplay, innovative sampling, and witty skits, the band's debut album, 3 Feet High and Rising, has been called \"a hip hop masterpiece.\" It is the band's biggest commercial success to date, with their subsequent albums selling progressively less, despite receiving high praise from critics. They were influential in the early stages of rapper/actor Mos Def's career, and are a core part of the Spitkicker collective. They are the second longest standing Native Tongues Posse group, after the Jungle Brothers. In 2006, the group won a Grammy for their collaboration with Gorillaz on the single \"Feel Good Inc.\" In early 2015, they announced plans to release a Kickstarter-funded upcoming 9th studio album And the Anonymous Nobody in September 2015; it was released on August 26, 2016. The album tracks are said to be the result of multiple improvised jam sessions. The album also features guest appearances from artists such as Damon Albarn, Little Dragon, David Byrne and 2 Chainz."@en ;

Their hometown is what gave name to the band. Since 1996, they were joined by percussionist Papo Rom\u00E1n, who left the band in 2006 to dedicate time to his family. The band rose to prominence with their eponymous debut album, which was released in 1996. The album was a hit, spawning several hit singles like \"Salimos de Aqu\u00ED\" and \"El Wanab\u00ED\", and turning the band into one of the most popular musical groups in the island at the moment. Fiel a la Vega followed their debut album with four more studio albums, three of which were released independently. Despite not having the support of a multinational record label or wide publicity, after 20 years, the band is still considered by many as \"the most important rock band in the history of Puerto Rico\". In recent years, the band has seen little activity, with its members being involved in personal projects. Singer Auger has been touring the island solo, and with a musician troupe called La Banda Ac\u00FAstica Rodante, while guitarist Laureano has been pursuing a solo career, while also touring the island with fellow guitarist Joel Rodr\u00EDguez.

After their success waned in the late 1980s, the band split up in 1989 and its members pursued other musical endeavours including group and solo efforts. Brad Gillis and Kelly Keagy teamed up with bassist Gary Moon and released an album without the other original band members in 1995, but the band soon re-united to release two new albums in the latter half of the decade. Despite the departure of original keyboardist Alan Fitzgerald and guitarist Jeff Watson, the band has continued to tour and remains very popular in Asian countries, particularly Japan."@en ;

In 1992, the group moved to the Boston area, where they were joined by second guitarist, Bill Guerra. After releasing Free T.V.s on a Boston area indie label, they were signed by Sony and recorded \"Head to the Ground\" with producer Mike Denneen. It was released on Columbia Records in 1996. The single \"Download (I Will)\" received considerable airplay on North American radio stations, reaching No. 22 on Billboard's Mainstream Rock Tracks chart, and was included (as track 14) on the soundtrack for the film The Cable Guy. The group's first major release ended up being their last with Columbia. This was not at all due to any musical failure\u2014the group's brand of tuneful, post-grunge, melodic rock was truly exceptional and perfectly tailored for radio play-lists, yet the group received little attention from the label despite their song-crafting and high profile support spots with the likes of '90s superstars Stone Temple Pilots. After leaving Columbia in 1997, the band signed to Polydor (U.S.) and was joined by new drummer Mike Piehl. Working with Nick Gatfield (Polydor) and producer Matt Hyde, (Porno for Pyros, Monster Magnet) they recorded their sophomore effort entitled \"Love and Disaster.\" The band recorded and delivered a highly polished rock album at a very precarious time in the music industry. In 1999, immediately following delivery of the album, Universal Music merged with Polygram and thinned their combined rosters. The band was dropped before the record was ever released and the label opted to keep the master recordings even though other labels were eager to sign the band and release the new album. The band dissolved soon thereafter. In 2009, 10 years later, Universal agreed to return the masters to the band and the album was subsequently released online October 2010."@en ;

Former members Matt Tong and Gordon Moakes left the band in 2013 and 2015 respectively. Their brand of music, whilst rooted in rock, retains elements of other genres such as electronica and house music. The band was formed at the 1999 Reading Festival by Okereke and Lissack. They went through a variety of names before settling on Bloc Party in 2003. Moakes joined the band after answering an advert in NME magazine, while Tong was picked via an audition. Bloc Party got their break by giving BBC Radio 1 DJ Steve Lamacq and Franz Ferdinand's lead singer, Alex Kapranos, a copy of their demo \"She's Hearing Voices\". In February 2005, the band released their debut album Silent Alarm. It was critically acclaimed and was named Indie Album of the Year at the 2006 PLUG Awards and NME Album of the year which both honour indie music. That year, the record was also certified platinum in Britain. The band built on this success in 2007 with the release of their second studio album, A Weekend in the City, which reached a peak of number two in the UK Albums Chart and number twelve in the Billboard 200. In August 2008, Bloc Party released their third studio record, Intimacy which entered the UK Albums Chart at number eight and number eighteen on the Billboard 200. The band went on a hiatus in October 2009 to focus on side projects. They reunited in September 2011, and shortly thereafter released their fourth album, Four, which entered the UK Albums Chart at number three. In 2013, Bloc Party released their third EP titled The Nextwave Sessions in August; the band then began an indefinite hiatus to continue with their respective side projects. The band's fifth studio album, Hymns, the first to involve Harris and Bartle, was released on 29 January 2016. Bloc Party have sold over 3 million albums worldwide."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Cake (stylized CAKE) is an American alternative rock band from Sacramento, California. Consisting of singer John McCrea, trumpeter Vince DiFiore, guitarist Xan McCurdy, bassist Gabe Nelson and drummer Paulo Baldi, the band has been noted for McCrea's sarcastic lyrics and monotone vocals, DiFiore's trumpet parts, and their wide-ranging musical influences, including country music, Mariachi, rock, funk, Iranian folk music and hip hop. Cake was formed in 1991 by McCrea, DiFiore, Greg Brown, Frank French and Shon Meckfessel, who soon left and was replaced by Nelson. Following the self-release of its debut album, Motorcade of Generosity, the band was signed to Capricorn Records in 1995 and released its first single, \"Rock 'n' Roll Lifestyle\", which hit number 35 on the Modern Rock Tracks music chart and was featured on MTV's 120 Minutes; French and Nelson then left the band, and were replaced by Todd Roper and Victor Damiani. Cake's second album, 1996's Fashion Nugget, went platinum on the strength of its lead single, \"The Distance\". Following a tour of Europe and the United States, both Brown and Damiani announced they were leaving Cake, which led to speculation about the band's future; McCrea eventually recruited Xan McCurdy to take over on guitar, and persuaded Nelson to return. Prolonging the Magic, the band's third album, was released in 1998 and went platinum, having shipped over one million units; this was followed three years later by Comfort Eagle, the band's first album on Columbia Records, featuring the single \"Short Skirt/Long Jacket\" which hit number 7 on the Modern Rock Tracks chart. Following a series of tours, including several versions of the Unlimited Sunshine Tour, the band released Pressure Chief in 2004, its second and last album on Columbia. After creating its own label, Upbeat Records, the band released Showroom of Compassion in 2011, which became its first album to debut at the top of the Billboard charts, selling 44,000 copies in the first week after release."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Canned Heat is an American rock band formed in Los Angeles in 1965. The group has been noted for its interpretations of blues material and for its efforts to promote interest in this type of music and its original artists. It was launched by two blues enthusiasts, Alan Wilson and Bob Hite, who took the name from Tommy Johnson's 1928 \"Canned Heat Blues\", a song about an alcoholic who had desperately turned to drinking Sterno, generically called \"canned heat\". After appearances at the Monterey and Woodstock festivals at the end of the 1960s, the band acquired worldwide fame with a lineup consisting of Bob Hite (vocals), Alan Wilson (guitar, harmonica and vocals), Henry Vestine and later Harvey Mandel (lead guitar), Larry Taylor (bass), and Adolfo de la Parra (drums). The music and attitude of Canned Heat afforded them a large following and established the band as one of the popular acts of the hippie era. Canned Heat appeared at most major musical events at the end of the 1960s, performing blues standards along with their own material and occasionally indulging in lengthy 'psychedelic' solos. Two of their songs \u2013 \"Going Up the Country\" and \"On the Road Again\" \u2013 became international hits. \"Going Up the Country\" was a remake of the Henry Thomas song \"Bull Doze Blues\", recorded in Louisville, Kentucky, in 1927. \"On the Road Again\" was a cover version of the 1953 Floyd Jones song of the same name, which is reportedly based on the Tommy Johnson song \"Big Road Blues\", recorded in 1928. Since the early 1970s, numerous personnel changes have occurred, although the current lineup includes all three surviving members of the classic lineup: de la Parra (who has remained in the band since first joining in 1967), Mandel, and Taylor. For much of the 1990s and 2000s, de la Parra was the only member from the band's 1960s lineup. He wrote a book about the band's career. Larry Taylor, whose presence in the band has not been steady, is the other surviving member from the earliest lineups. Mandel, Walter Trout and Junior Watson are among the guitarists who gained fame for playing in later editions of the band. British blues pioneer John Mayall found several musicians for his band among former members of Canned Heat."@en ;

Their second album, Colour by Numbers, sold more than 10 million copies worldwide, and the band sold more than 150 million records overall. It has been certified triple platinum in the UK and quadruple platinum in the US. It appeared on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 100 Best Albums of the 1980s and is also included in the book 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die.

Boy George's androgynous style of dressing caught the attention of the public and the media. The group, supporters of the synth pop genre, made numerous forays into reggae and showed a strong propensity for the subgenre of ballads. They are considered one of the most representative and influential groups of the 1980s. They have sold more than 150 million records. Ten of their singles reached the US Top 40, where they are associated with the Second British Invasion of British new wave groups that became popular in the US due to the cable music channel MTV. Culture Club's music combines British new wave and American soul with Jamaican reggae and also other styles such as calypso, salsa or country. In 1984, Culture Club won Brit Awards for Best British Group, Best British Single (\"Karma Chameleon\"), and the Grammy Award for Best New Artist. They were nominated the same year for the Grammy Award for Pop Vocal by Group or Duo but the English rock band The Police won the award.

The duo achieved significant popularity in the late 1990s as part of the French house movement and were met with continuous success in the years following, combining elements of house music with funk, techno, disco, rock music and synthpop influences. They are also known for their visual stylization and disguises associated with their music; the duo have worn ornate helmets and gloves to assume robot personas in most of their public appearances since 2001 and rarely grant interviews or appear on television. The duo were managed from 1996 to 2008 by Pedro Winter (also known as Busy P), the head of Ed Banger Records. Bangalter and de Homem-Christo were originally in an indie rock band named Darlin' which disbanded after a short period of time, leaving the two to experiment musically with drum machines and synthesizers. The duo released their debut studio album Homework through Virgin Records in 1997 to highly positive reviews. The duo's next album Discovery (2001) was even more successful, driven by the release of the hit singles \"One More Time\", \"Digital Love\" and \"Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger\". In March 2005, the duo released their third album Human After All to mixed reviews. However, the singles \"Robot Rock\" and \"Technologic\" achieved considerable success in the United Kingdom. Daft Punk toured throughout 2006 and 2007 and released the live album Alive 2007, which won a Grammy Award for Best Electronic/Dance Album. The duo later composed the score for the Disney film Tron: Legacy in 2010, and released its soundtrack album that same year. In January 2013, Daft Punk left Virgin for Columbia Records, and released their next album Random Access Memories in 2013 to worldwide critical acclaim. The album's lead single \"Get Lucky\" became an international success, peaking on top 10 charts in 32 countries. Random Access Memories won five Grammy Awards in 2014, including Album of the Year and Record of the Year for \"Get Lucky\"."@en ;

Since 1992, the band has consisted of Joe Elliott (lead vocals), Rick Savage (bassist, backing vocals), Rick Allen (drums, backing vocals), Phil Collen (guitar, backing vocals), and Vivian Campbell (guitar, backing vocals). This is the band's longest-standing line-up. The band's strongest commercial success came between the early 1980s and the early 1990s. Their 1981 album, High 'n' Dry, was produced by Robert John \"Mutt\" Lange, who helped them begin to define their style, and the album's standout track \"Bringin' On the Heartbreak\" became one of the first rock videos played on MTV in 1982. The band's next studio album, Pyromania in January 1983, with \"Photograph\" as the lead single, turned Def Leppard into a household name. In the U.S., Pyromania was certified Diamond (10\u00D7 Platinum). In 2003, the album ranked number 384 on Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time. Def Leppard's fourth album Hysteria, released in August 1987, topped the UK and U.S. album charts. As of 2009, it has reached beyond the success of Pyromania, having been certified 12\u00D7 Platinum for sales of over 12 million in the U.S. and has gone on to sell over 25 million copies worldwide. The album spawned seven hit singles, including the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 number one \"Love Bites\", alongside \"Pour Some Sugar on Me\", \"Hysteria\", \"Armageddon It\", \"Animal\", \"Rocket\", and \"Women\". Their next studio album, Adrenalize (the first following the death of guitarist Steve Clark), reached number one in the UK and U.S. charts in 1992, and contained several hits, including \"Let's Get Rocked\" and \"Have You Ever Needed Someone So Bad\". Their 1993 album, Retro Active, contained the acoustic hit song \"Two Steps Behind\", while their greatest-hits album Vault, released in 1995, featured the UK hit \"When Love & Hate Collide\".

	foaf:name	"Enigma"@en ;
	dbo:abstract	"Enigma is a German musical project founded in 1990 by Romanian-German musician and producer Michael Cretu. Cretu had released several solo records, collaborated with various artists, and produced albums for his then wife, German pop singer Sandra, before he conceived the idea of a New Age, Worldbeat project. He recorded the first Enigma studio album, MCMXC a.D. (1990), with contributions from David Fairstein and Frank Peterson. The album remains Enigma's biggest, helped by the international hit single, \"Sadeness (Part I)\", which sold 12 million units alone. According to Cretu, the inspiration for the creation of the project came from his desire to make a kind of music that did not obey \"the old rules and habits\" and presented a new form of artistic expression with mystic and experimental components. Enigma followed MCMXC a.D. with a series of albums that involved several musicians and producers working with Cretu. The first was The Cross of Changes (1993), which incorporated tribal and ethnic influences and sold over 8 million copies worldwide, followed by Le Roi est mort, vive le Roi! (1996), which blended together the Gregorian chants reminiscent from the first album and the strong intercultural soundscapes present in the second. Enigma's fourth album was The Screen Behind the Mirror, released in 2000, which started a slight departure from the previous world music themes towards a heavier electronic atmosphere. This evolution culminated with Voyageur, its fifth and more pop-based album, and 2006's A Posteriori, a work inspired by the future collision between the Milky Way and Andromeda galaxies, with distinct operatic tones and an electronic spectrum closer to Voyageur than the earlier releases. Seven Lives Many Faces, its seventh album, was released in 2008 and contained a mixture of classical and modern elements ranging from ethnic chants to rap and dubstep influences. Its eighth album, The Fall of a Rebel Angel, was announced for a November 2016 release. Enigma has sold over 70 million records worldwide, reached 60 number 1 songs at the charts around the world and achieved over 100 Gold and Platinum certificates. The project has also received 3 Grammy nominations and is one of the best-selling musical acts of all time."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Exodus is an American thrash metal band formed in 1979 in Richmond, California. Spanning a career of 38 years, Exodus has gone through numerous lineup changes, two extended hiatuses, and the deaths of two former band members. Their current lineup consists of vocalist Steve \"Zetro\" Souza, guitarists Gary Holt and Lee Altus, bassist Jack Gibson and drummer Tom Hunting. Hunting is one of the original members, and departed from Exodus twice, in 1989 and 2004, but rejoined in 2007. Holt joined the band shortly after its formation, and is the only member of Exodus to appear on all their releases. Since its formation, Exodus has released ten studio albums, two live albums and two compilations. Along with Possessed, Testament, Death Angel, Vio-Lence, Forbidden, L\u00E4\u00E4z Rockit and Metallica, whose longtime lead guitarist Kirk Hammett was an original member of Exodus, they are often credited as pioneers of the Bay Area thrash metal scene, and have sold over five million albums worldwide as of 2013. Exodus had particular success in the mid-to-late 1980s with their first three studio albums\u2015Bonded by Blood, Pleasures of the Flesh and Fabulous Disaster. The critical praise given to Fabulous Disaster garnered attention from major labels, including Capitol Records, with whom Exodus had signed in 1989. Exodus released two more studio albums (Impact Is Imminent and Force of Habit) before disbanding in 1994. After temporarily reuniting in 1997-1998, Exodus reformed once again in 2001, and since then, they have released five more studio albums, the most recent being 2014's Blood In, Blood Out. The band is expected to release their next studio album in late 2017."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"(This article is about the rock band. For other uses, see Fallout Boy.) Fall Out Boy is an American rock band formed in Wilmette, Illinois, a suburb of Chicago, in 2001. The band consists of vocalist and guitarist Patrick Stump, bassist Pete Wentz, guitarist Joe Trohman, and drummer Andy Hurley. The band originated from Chicago's hardcore punk scene, with which all members were involved at one point. The group was formed by Wentz and Trohman as a pop punk side project of the members' respective hardcore bands, and Stump joined shortly thereafter. The group went through a succession of drummers before landing Hurley and recording the group's debut album, Take This to Your Grave (2003). The album became an underground success and helped the band gain a dedicated fanbase through heavy touring, as well as some moderate commercial success. Take This to Your Grave has commonly been cited as an influential blueprint for pop punk music in the 2000s. With Wentz as the band's lyricist and Stump as the primary composer, the band's 2005 major-label breakthrough, From Under the Cork Tree, produced two hit singles, \"Sugar, We're Goin Down\" and \"Dance, Dance,\" and went double platinum, transforming the group into superstars and making Wentz a celebrity and tabloid fixture. Fall Out Boy received a Best New Artist nomination at the 2006 Grammy Awards. The band's 2007 follow-up, Infinity on High, landed at number one on the Billboard 200 with 260,000 first week sales. It produced two worldwide hit singles, \"This Ain't a Scene, It's an Arms Race\" and \"Thnks fr th Mmrs.\" Folie \u00E0 Deux, the band's fourth album, created a mixed response from fans and commercially undersold expectations. Following the release of Believers Never Die \u2013 Greatest Hits, the band took a hiatus from 2009 to 2012 to \"decompress,\" exploring various side projects. The band regrouped and recorded Save Rock and Roll (2013), which gave the band its second career number one and produced the top 20 single \"My Songs Know What You Did in the Dark (Light Em Up).\" The group's sixth studio album, American Beauty/American Psycho (2015), released worldwide on Island Records, was preceded by the top 10 hit \"Centuries\" and also spawned the 2x platinum single \"Uma Thurman\" which peaked at 22 on Hot 100. The album peaked at No. 1, making it the band's third No. 1 album and the group's fifth consecutive top 10 album."@en ;

During the band's career, they have released nine full-length albums and have evolved through a succession of styles, including nu metal, death metal, groove metal, and thrash metal. Fear Factory was enormously influential on the heavy metal scene in the mid-to-late 1990s. Fear Factory went on hold in March 2002 following some internal disputes, but reformed later that year without founding member Dino Cazares, adding bassist Byron Stroud, and previous bassist Christian Olde Wolbers as guitarist. In April 2009, a new lineup was announced. Cazares returned as lead and rhythm guitarist, and Gene Hoglan as drummer. Bell and Stroud reprised their respective roles, and the band completed a seventh studio album titled Mechanize. Former members Christian Olde Wolbers and Raymond Herrera\u2014both of whom were playing in Arkaea\u2014disputed the legitimacy of the new lineup, and a legal battle from both parties was begun. Fear Factory released its eighth studio album, The Industrialist, in June 2012. Their latest album, Genexus, was released in August 2015. Over the years, Fear Factory has seen changes in its members, with lead vocalist Burton C. Bell being the only consistent member since 1989. The band has performed at three Ozzfests and the inaugural Gigantour. Their singles have charted on the US Mainstream Rock Top 40 and albums on the Billboard Top 40, 100, and 200, and they have sold more than a million albums in the U.S. alone."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Fields of the Nephilim are an English gothic rock band formed in Stevenage, Hertfordshire, England in 1984. The original line-up consisted of vocalist Carl McCoy, saxophonist Gary Wisker, Tony Pettitt on bass, guitarist Paul Wright and drummer Alexander \"Nod\" Wright. After the release of the debut EP Burning the Fields, Wisker left the band to be replaced by Peter Yates as second guitarist to what is widely known as the 'classic' line-up. The current incarnation of the band has released one authorized recording of new material and one double live album since 1990, but the group perform frequently, with Carl McCoy and Tony Pettit remaining from the original lineup. The band's name refers to a Biblical race of giants or angel-human hybrids, known as the Nephilim. Although they have not received substantial mainstream success, the band's seminal sound has proved highly influential, especially in the genre of gothic rock."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Franz Ferdinand are a Scottish rock band, formed in 2002 and based in Glasgow. The band's original lineup was composed of Alex Kapranos (lead vocals and guitar, keyboard), Nick McCarthy (rhythm guitar, keyboards and backing vocals), Bob Hardy (bass guitar), and Paul Thomson (drums, percussion and backing vocals). The band has been known for being one of the most popular post-punk revival bands, garnering multiple UK top 20 hits and selling over 3 million albums worldwide, as of late 2009. They have been nominated for several Grammy Awards and have received two Brit Awards\u2014winning one for Best British Group, as well as one NME Award. The band began by releasing their debut extended play, Darts of Pleasure, in 2003, under Domino Records. The band gained recognition in the United Kingdom after the EP's title track peaked at number 44 on UK Singles Chart. In January 2004, the band released the song \"Take Me Out\". The song went on to achieve global recognition, charting in several countries, and earned a Grammy nomination for Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal. It has since been noted as the band's signature song and has received critical acclaim from critics. The band subsequently released their eponymous debut studio album on 9 February 2004 to critical acclaim. The album won the 2004 Mercury Prize and earned a Grammy nomination for Best Alternative Album. In 2005, the band released their second studio album, You Could Have It So Much Better, which was produced by Rich Costey. The album went on to earn critical acclaim from critics as well as a positive commercial performance, peaking within the top-ten in multiple countries. The album earned a nomination for Best Alternative Album and one of the singles released from the album, \"Do You Want To\", earned a nomination for Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal at the 48th Annual Grammy Awards. The band's third studio album, Tonight: Franz Ferdinand, was announced in late 2008 and released in January 2009. The album was notable for featuring a change in the band's musical style, as the band had shifted from a post-punk-focused sound, which was featured on their first two albums, to a more dance-oriented sound. The album gained a positive commercial performance as well as positive reviews, but not as much acclaim as their first two albums. A remix album of Tonight, titled Blood, was subsequently released in July 2009. Four years after the release of Tonight, the band released their fourth studio album, Right Thoughts, Right Words, Right Action. In 2015, it was announced that Franz Ferdinand and American rock band Sparks had formed the supergroup FFS. The two released the album FFS in June 2015. In 2016, it was announced that Nick McCarthy had taken a break from the band to focus on family matters and other musical projects, but will be returning."@en ;

In 2003, the band announced an indefinite hiatus in order for band members to pursue other musical interests. In the intervening period, the group was occasionally rumored to have broken up, but the band finally reconvened for a tour beginning in late 2010. In October 2012, the band released its fourth album, 'Allelujah! Don't Bend! Ascend!. In March 2015, it released its fifth album, Asunder, Sweet and Other Distress. The band has gained an extremely dedicated cult following, and remain very influential in the post-rock genre. In September, 2013, 'Allelujah! Don't Bend!

To date, Idlewild have released seven full-length studio albums, with their latest, Everything Ever Written, released in February 2015. Initially, Idlewild's sound was faster and more dissonant than many of their 1990s indie rock contemporaries. However, it developed over time from an edgy and angular sound (as heard in their early material\u2014once described by the NME as \"the sound of a flight of stairs falling down a flight of stairs\") to a sweeping, melodic rock sound as displayed on The Remote Part and Warnings/Promises. While Idlewild's sound cannot be easily placed into a specific genre, they have clearly been influenced by the likes of: Gang of Four, Pavement, R.E.M., Blur and Fugazi. In 2010, the band entered an indefinite hiatus, but reunited in late 2013 to begin work on a new studio album."@en ;

The group is composed of Joseph Bruce and Joseph Utsler, who perform under the respective personas of the \"wicked clowns\" Violent J and Shaggy 2 Dope (originally 2 Dope). Insane Clown Posse performs a style of hardcore hip hop known as horrorcore and is known for its elaborate live performances. The duo has earned two platinum and five gold albums. According to Nielsen SoundScan, the entire catalog of the group has sold 6.5 million units in the United States and Canada as of April 2007. Originally known as JJ Boyz and Inner City Posse, the group introduced supernatural- and horror-themed lyrics as a means of distinguishing itself stylistically. The duo founded the independent record label Psychopathic Records with Alex Abbiss as manager, and produced and starred in the feature films Big Money Hustlas and Big Money Rustlas. They formed their own professional wrestling federation, Juggalo Championship Wrestling, and later collaborated with many well-known hip hop and rock musicians. The group has established a dedicated following called Juggalos numbering in the \"tens of thousands\". The songs of Insane Clown Posse center thematically on the mythology of the Dark Carnival, a metaphoric limbo in which the lives of the dead are judged by one of several entities. The Dark Carnival is elaborated through a series of stories called Joker's Cards, each of which offers a specific lesson designed to change the \"evil ways\" of listeners before \"the end consumes us all\". The original lineup of Insane Clown Posse was John Rode (Kid Villain), John Utsler (John Kickjazz), Joe Bruce (Violent J) & Joey Utsler (Shaggy 2 Dope). John Rode left after Dog Beats was released in 1991, and John Utsler left before Carnival of Carnage was released in 1992."@en ;

The band's discography has grown to thirty-eight albums, including sixteen studio albums, eleven live albums, four EPs, and seven compilations. Pioneers of the new wave of British heavy metal, Iron Maiden achieved initial success during the early 1980s. After several line-up changes, the band went on to release a series of UK and US platinum and gold albums, including 1982's The Number of the Beast, 1983's Piece of Mind, 1984's Powerslave, 1985's live release Live After Death, 1986's Somewhere in Time and 1988's Seventh Son of a Seventh Son. Since the return of lead vocalist Bruce Dickinson and guitarist Adrian Smith in 1999, the band have undergone a resurgence in popularity, with their 2010 studio offering, The Final Frontier, peaking at No. 1 in 28 countries and receiving widespread critical acclaim. Their sixteenth studio album, The Book of Souls, was released on 4 September 2015. Despite little radio or television support, Iron Maiden are considered one of the most successful heavy metal bands in history, with The Observer reporting in 2015 that the band have sold over 90 million copies of their albums worldwide. The band won the Ivor Novello Award for international achievement in 2002. As of October 2013, the band have played over 2000 live shows throughout their career. For the past 35 years, the band have been supported by their famous mascot, \"Eddie\", who has appeared on almost all of their album and single covers, as well as in their live shows."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Kiss (often styled as KISS) is an American rock band formed in New York City in January 1973 by Paul Stanley, Gene Simmons, Peter Criss and Ace Frehley. Well known for its members' face paint and stage outfits, the group rose to prominence in the mid-to-late 1970s with their elaborate live performances, which featured fire breathing, blood-spitting, smoking guitars, shooting rockets, levitating drum kits, and pyrotechnics. The band has gone through several lineup changes, with Stanley and Simmons the only remaining original members. The original and best-known lineup consisted of Stanley (lead vocals and rhythm guitar), Simmons (vocals and bass guitar), Ace Frehley (lead guitar and vocals) and Peter Criss (drums and vocals). With their make-up and costumes, they took on the personae of comic book-style characters: The Starchild (Stanley), The Demon (Simmons), The Spaceman or Space Ace (Frehley) and The Catman (Criss). Due to creative differences, both Criss and Frehley had departed the group by 1982. In 1983, Kiss began performing without makeup and costumes, thinking that it was time to leave the makeup behind. The band accordingly experienced a minor commercial resurgence, and their music videos received regular airplay on MTV. Drummer Eric Carr, who had replaced Criss in 1980, died in 1991 of a rare type of heart cancer and was replaced by Eric Singer. In response to a wave of Kiss nostalgia in the mid-1990s, the band announced a reunion of the original lineup in 1996, which also saw the return of their makeup and stage costumes. The resulting Alive/Worldwide Tour was commercially successful. Criss and Frehley have both since left the band again and have been replaced by Singer and Tommy Thayer, respectively. Kiss has sold more than 100 million records worldwide, including 25 million RIAA-certified albums. On April 10, 2014, Kiss was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame."@en ;
