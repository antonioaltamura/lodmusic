	dbo:abstract	"Pl\u00E1hnetan was an Icelandic rock band formed in the spring of 1993 after singer Stef\u00E1n Hilmarsson, Ing\u00F3lfur Gu\u00F0j\u00F3nsson and Sigur\u00F0ur Gr\u00F6ndal wrote several songs for Stef\u00E1n\u2019s forthcoming solo album, but the group got along so well that they decided to continue composing and even form a new band with that material under Stef\u00E1n\u2019s management. The name Pl\u00E1hnetan is a game-word, since the word pl\u00E1neta means planet, but with the addition of the h, the ending part formed is hneta, which mean nut. Therefore, its name could be translated as the planut. In those days Stef\u00E1n and bassist Fri\u00F0rik Sturluson were in the band S\u00E1lin hans J\u00F3ns m\u00EDns while Ing\u00F3lfur Gu\u00F0j\u00F3nsson and Sigur\u00F0ur Gr\u00F6ndal had quit their band Lo\u00F0in Rotta, so they called drummer Ing\u00F3lfur Sigur\u00F0sson, who up to that moment had been playing in bands like S\u00ED\u00F0an Skein S\u00F3l (a.k.a. S.S.S\u00F3l) and Rau\u00F0ir Fletir. The band contacted Steinar Berg \u00CDsleifsson, the owner of label Sk\u00EDfan and got a record deal, which allowed them to released their debut album in June the same year under the title of Speis (Icelandic for Space), a work which dealt with the concept of space and got good reviews by the critics. Some of the songs became very popular and the band took the chance to tour the country to promote the album.After this album, singer Stef\u00E1n released a solo album called L\u00EDf (Life) with the help of the band. By 1994 Fri\u00F0rik left the band and was replaced by bassist Jakob Sm\u00E1ri Magn\u00FAsson, who was known by playing in Tappi T\u00EDkarrass, MX-21 and S.S.S\u00F3l. the new line-up released an album in June called Plast (Plastic) which featured singer Bj\u00F6rgvin Halld\u00F3rsson in the song \u201C\u00C9g Vissi \u00DEa\u00F0\u201D.By the fall Pl\u00E1hnetan released one single called S\u00E6la with the collaboration of singer Emil\u00EDana Torrini. In 1995 they call it to the end when Stef\u00E1n\u2019s band S\u00E1lin Hans J\u00F3ns M\u00EDns started to play again."@en ;

After two rehearsals the band recorded their 7\" eight song debut in Rotterdam. It was not until a year later when Das Oath started to play shows. With only one 7\" released the band hit the road and played all over Europe during the fall of 2000. Upon their return to The Netherlands the band went straight into the studio to record songs for what would become their 9\" / 10\" record. After the recording session the band started to prepare for their first USA tour slated in December 2000. Shows took place on the Westcoast tour in the USA with Total Fury from Japan. One of the highlights was the show at Gilman in Berkeley with Spazz. The tour barely broke even, yet more tours in Europe (with The Locust) and the USA (with Limpwrist and Total Fury). Meanwhile, the limited 10\" version came out for the spring tour on the Eastcoast. The regular 9\" version was finally released late 2001. Shortly upon its released it was banned by the distributor for its controversial artwork. Their self-conscious move away from a typical punk rock aesthetic presaged a signing to Dim Mak Records, an extremely varied and commercial label that released Das Oath's most critically well-received release, their self-titled LP from 2004. A mini-LP saw release in 2006 through Youth Attack, with the compact disc released again by Dim Mak. 2006 also saw the release of a self-titled 11\" on Youth Attack/Coalition with the compact disc on 31G and Das Oath's funereal release, a tour-only all-covers split LP with Ampere. Das Oath featured former/current members of Holy Molar, Failures, Monster X, Charles Bronson, VMW, Mainstrike, Devoid of Faith and Oil."@en ;

Huckins, Rusnack and Gormley were already familiar musically as they had all previously performed together in the New Jersey band Rorschach. A demo tape was quickly recorded and heavily circulated around the New York City area which responded with high praise. The band decided to leave their New Jersey roots and follow Tim to Seattle. The band recorded their 1997 debut LP She Loves Me, She Loves Me Not for Revelation Records. Produced by Billy Anderson, the album had the same familiar sound that fans of Deadguy and Rorschach had come to know along with Singer's melodramatic screams and ramblings. The tracks \"Preacher\" and \"Target Practice\" which were omitted from She Loves Me.. were also released this same year as a 7\" EP through Revelation. In 1997, the band toured with Unsane. They also toured with death metal outfit Obituary. Shortly after the tour, Huckins decided the touring and music were no longer to his liking and was replaced by Seattle hardcore veteran and Kiss It Goodbye illustrator Demian \"Headboy\" Johnston. The band recorded material in 1998 for an EP that was to be released by Sub Pop Records but was never released by the label as Tim Singer soon decided to leave the band, effectively dissolving it. The tracks were eventually released by Revelation Records as the Choke CD/7\" EP."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"The Michael Nyman Band, formerly known as the Campiello Band, is a group formed as a street band for a 1976 production of Carlo Goldoni's 1756 play, Il Campiello directed by Bill Bryden at the Old Vic. The band did not wish to break up after the production ended, so its director, Michael Nyman, began composing music for the group to perform, beginning with \"In Re Don Giovanni\", written in 1977. Originally made up of old instruments such as rebecs, sackbuts and shawms alongside more modern instruments like the banjo and saxophone to produce as loud a sound as possible without amplification, it later switched to a fully amplified line-up of string quartet, double bass, clarinet, three saxophones, horn, trumpet, bass trombone, bass guitar, and piano. This line up has been variously altered and augmented for some works. The band's first recorded album on a professional label was Nyman's second, the self-titled Michael Nyman (1981), which mostly comprised pieces written for the early films of Peter Greenaway. This album has yet to be released on compact disc. Another self-titled album (1995) has appeared as a promotional item compiling tracks from various other albums, and should not be confused with this one. Along with soundtracks to Greenaway's The Draughtsman's Contract, Drowning by Numbers, and The Cook The Thief His Wife & Her Lover, their 1980s output included The Kiss and Other Movements (which includes the titular art song; a song from Nyman's projected Tristram Shandy opera; a tango; a movement from the same work as \"Memorial\" as used in Greenaway's 26 Bathrooms; and a performance of music (not the original soundtrack) from Greenaway's Making a Splash) and the modern dance work And Do They Do. They also made a limited edition recording of Nyman's La Travers\u00E9e de Paris in 1989; many of its individual movements were soon to be dismantled, revised, or simply transplanted whole, to serve as the soundtrack for Greenaway's Prospero's Books (1991). Conversely, Nyman composed music for another adaptation of William Shakespeare's The Tempest, the ballet-opera Noises, Sounds & Sweet Airs, soon after Prospero's Books, some of which was dervied from La Travers\u00E9e de Paris. Their 1992 album, The Essential Michael Nyman Band, may appear to be a greatest hits compilation, but is actually composed of the concert versions of various film pieces, having undergone years of revisions and refinement, are significantly different from their soundtrack counterparts, to a far more severe extent than typical differences between classical music performances. This album also contains two cuts from the film score to A Zed & Two Noughts, which was originally performed by an orchestra of musicians who were never members of the band, with solos by band members Nyman, Balanescu, Perry, and Leonard. Similarly, The Piano was performed by members of the Munich Philharmonic Orchestra with Harle, Roach, Findon, and Nyman, but is also part of the band's repertoire. In 1993, the band joined with an orchestra for the first time in their recording history with MGV: Musique \u00E0 Grand Vitesse, a piece commissioned for the opening of a TGV line, first performed on 26 September 1993, in which the band, according to Nyman's own liner notes, represents the tracks, \"resisting the temptation of the concerto grosso\". The album credit is to \"The Michael Nyman Band and Orchestra\". The group has largely been superseded by the Michael Nyman Orchestra. Such soundtrack albums as Practical Magic, Ravenous, The End of the Affair, The Claim, and The Libertine are credited to this group, first implied on that 1994 album. While the former two titles lack detailed credits, the latter three albums show that most of the band (not to say most of those credited as full members over its history) performs in the Orchestra. The band's existence is far from over, however, as Nyman orchestrated his 2002 opera, Facing Goya, specifically for the band. His previous two opera recordings include band members but are not formally credited to the band, and one, the aforementioned Noises, Sounds & Sweet Airs, uses a full-scale orchestra, without Nyman at the baton. Man and Boy: Dada (2004) and Love Counts (2005; recorded 2007), Nyman's newest operas, feature the band conducted by Paul McGrath.. In 1996, another offshoot group, The Nyman Quartet, consisting of Cathy Thompson, Gabrielle Lester, Kate Musker, and Tony Hinnigan, recorded The Ballad of Kastriot Rexhepi (with Sarah Leonard--the only singer ever credited as a band member) and Exit No Exit, and plan to record the third recording of Nyman's four string quartets. They are produced by David Cunningham. Many of the current and former band members, including John Harle, Alexander Balanescu, Dave Lee, Madeleine Mitchell, Andrew Findon, and Simon Haram, have released solo albums that include performances of Nyman's music."@en ;

Kirchgessner's compositions and way of guitar playing reminds of Deep Purples's Ritchie Blackmore, and Schaab's vocals recalled the screams of Robert Plant from Led Zeppelin. The group played a loud, Deep Purple/Black Sabbath/Led Zeppelin style rock, with a characteristic \"heavy progressive\" instrumentation of lead guitar, organ, bass and drums. The album was produced by Konrad Plank (whose production credits include Kraftwerk's early output and Ash Ra Tempel) at the Windrose Studio, Hamburg. With their sudden shifts of rhythm structures, guitar-with-organ riffing style and some studio effects, particularly phasing, Night Sun never went too close to the ordinary boogie and rock'n'roll trap. Their sound consisted of many elements, all of which will be of interest to fans of Thrash, Stoner, Doom, Power and Prog Metal, and their 1970s roots."@en ;

They performed using three computers, one playing drum samples, one playing basses and the third playing leads and other samples. Artwork controlled the master laptop, to which the other two are synchronised via MIDI. Their sets usually consisted of a mix of original tracks produced together, and live remixes of Benga and Skream's tracks, accompanied by synchronised projected visuals by Novak Collective. They signed to Columbia Records in February 2010. Magnetic Man completed their first full-length sellout tour on 5 November 2010. Their eponymous debut studio album, Magnetic Man, was released through Sony by Columbia Records on 10 October 2010."@en ;

After a number of festival dates in 2007, the band went on hiatus. In 2010, they regrouped to play a number of shows (including a return to WOMAD), releasing a re-mastered retrospective titled Capture. On 20 May 2014 Afro Celt Sound System announced the upcoming release of a new album, Born. In January 2016, a posting to that website revealed that due to a dispute with Emmerson, who announced his departure from the band in 2015, there were two active versions of the band, a version led by Emmerson and a separate line-up headed by James McNally and Martin Russell. Emmerson's version of the band plans to release the album The Source in 2016."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Dead Kennedys are an American punk rock band formed in San Francisco, California in 1978. The band was one of the first American hardcore bands to make a significant impact in the United Kingdom. Dead Kennedys' lyrics were usually political in nature, satirizing establishment political figures (both liberal and conservative) and authority in general, as well as popular culture and even the punk movement itself. During their initial incarnation between 1978 and 1986, they attracted considerable controversy for their provocative lyrics and artwork. Several stores refused to stock their recordings, provoking debate about censorship in rock music; in the mid 80s vocalist and primary lyricist Jello Biafra became an active campaigner against the Parents Music Resource Center. This culminated in an obscenity trial between 1985 and 1986, which resulted in a hung jury. They released a total of four studio albums and one EP before disbanding in 1986. Following the band's dissolution, Biafra continued to collaborate and record with other artists including D.O.A., NoMeansNo and his own bands Lard and the Guantanamo School of Medicine, as well as releasing several spoken word performances. In 2000 (upheld on appeal in 2003), Jello Biafra lost an acrimonious legal case initiated by his former Dead Kennedys band mates over songwriting credits and unpaid royalties. In 2001, the band reformed without Biafra; various singers have since been recruited for vocal duties."@en ;

After releasing four full-length albums and touring extensively throughout the 1980s and early 1990s, Dark Angel disbanded in 1992. They reformed in 2002. However, Dark Angel disbanded once again, due to Ron Rinehart's vocal issues after an accident, which forced the band to cancel plans to tour further.

The band is known for their loud, energetic live shows. In 2007, the band began releasing music through their own imprint label, Born & Bred via Alternative Distribution Alliance. 2007's The Meanest of Times made its debut at No. 20 on the Billboard charts and featured the successful single, \"The State of Massachusetts\", while 2011's Going Out in Style was an even bigger success, making its debut at No. 6, giving the band their highest-charting album to date.

Their music is categorized as being associated with both progressive metal and progressive rock, yet having been heavily influenced by nu metal and psychedelic rock music. The band is also heavily influenced with western bands like Metallica, Megadeth, Limp Bizkit, Rage Against the Machine, Tool, Linkin Park and Oleander, amongst other western music rock artists. The band are noted for being one of the pioneer mainstream rock bands in the Pakistani music industry. Their debut album, Irtiqa, released in 2003, is the first mainstream concept album to be released by a Pakistani artist. The album produced by Zulfiqar J. Khan, Fawad Khan and Mekaal Hasan, was a critical acclaim in Pakistan. In 2007, Entity Paradigm had an interview with a local newspaper in which they announced that the band would disband due to various members aiming to pursue different projects. Early reports from the band hinted towards an album release in late 2004. In 2009, the band announced their official comeback with Fawad Afzal Khan and Ahmed Ali Butt in leading positions. However, two of the main members of the band, Zulfiqar J. Khan and Sajjad A. Khan, decided not to make a comeback due to work on different projects. Qirat Hamed covered their song Bolo Bolo. Fawad Khan in an interview to renowned journalist Adil Mansoor said that Qirats version was better than the bands."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Feeder are a Welsh rock band formed in Newport, Wales. They have released nine studio albums, three compilations, two EPs, and 34 singles. They have spent a total of 181 weeks on the singles and albums charts combined with their own releases as of 2016, and have accumulated 25 top 75 singles between 1997 and 2012. The band have also had two chart appearances as featured or guest performers, with their appearance on the Band Aid 20 single in 2004 being their only number one single if regarded. Feeder's music has been inspired by a wide variety of artists and styles, including The Police, Nirvana, and The Smashing Pumpkins. Their early material showcased a heavy rock sound reminiscent of grunge, but the band would later introduce more acoustic aspects into their music, including elements of pianos and string orchestras. The band was formed in 1992 under the name of \"Reel\" by vocalist and guitarist Grant Nicholas, drummer Jon Lee and bassist Simon Blight, three of the four members of Raindancer, after the departure of that band's other member, guitarist John Canham. However, Blight left Reel later in 1992, and the band played with many session bassists before hiring Taka Hirose in 1995, a year after the band signed with The Echo Label. Feeder garnered media attention in 2001 for their third album, Echo Park, and its lead single, \"Buck Rogers\", which later become a UK Top 5 single. In January 2002, Jon Lee committed suicide in his Miami home, after which the remaining members began to record and play with former Skunk Anansie drummer Mark Richardson. They released their fourth album, Comfort in Sound later that year, which touched on themes such as loss and coming to terms with death, while also exploring themes of positivity. Richardson was ultimately made an official member, remaining so until May 2009 when he returned to a reformed Skunk Anansie. Feeder employed Australian Damon Wilson and former Mexicolas drummer Tim Trotter for sessions and touring commitments for Renegades (2010), and they have since employed drummer Karl Brazil. Between 2010-2016, the band charted three more top 20 albums, with the latest of these being 2016's All Bright Electric returning them to the top 10."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Gong is an international psychedelic rock band known for incorporating elements of jazz and space rock into its musical style. The group was formed in Paris in 1967 by Australian musician Daevid Allen and English vocalist Gilli Smyth. Notable band members have included Didier Malherbe, Pip Pyle, Steve Hillage, Mike Howlett, Pierre Moerlen, Bill Laswell and Theo Travis. Others who have played on stage with Gong include Don Cherry, Chris Cutler, Bill Bruford, Brian Davison, Dave Stewart and Tatsuya Yoshida. Gong released its debut album, Magick Brother, in 1970, which featured a psychedelic pop sound. By the following year, the second album, Camembert Electrique, featured the more psychedelic rock/space rock sound with which they would be most associated. Between 1973 and 1974, Gong released their best known work, the allegorical Radio Gnome Invisible trilogy, describing the adventures of Zero the Hero, the Good Witch Yoni and the Pot Head Pixies from the Planet Gong. In 1975, Daevid Allen & Gilli Smyth left the band, which continued without them, releasing a series of jazz rock albums under the leadership of drummer Pierre Moerlen. This incarnation of the band became known as Pierre Moerlen's Gong. Meanwhile, Smyth formed Mother Gong while Allen initiated a series of spin-off groups, including Planet Gong, New York Gong and Gongmaison, before returning to lead Gong once again in 1990 until his death in 2015. With Allen's encouragement, the band decided to continue and released the album Rejoice! I'm Dead! on 16 September 2016."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Guns N' Roses is an American hard rock band from Los Angeles formed in 1985. The classic lineup, as signed to Geffen Records in 1986, consisted of vocalist Axl Rose, lead guitarist Slash, rhythm guitarist Izzy Stradlin, bassist Duff McKagan, and drummer Steven Adler. The current lineup consists of Rose, Slash, McKagan, keyboardists Dizzy Reed and Melissa Reese, guitarist Richard Fortus and drummer Frank Ferrer. The band has released six studio albums, accumulating sales of more than 100 million records worldwide, including shipments of 45 million in the United States, making Guns N' Roses one of the world's best-selling bands of all time. Guns N' Roses' debut album, Appetite for Destruction (1987), reached number one on the Billboard 200 a year after its release, on the strength of \"Sweet Child o' Mine\", the group's only single to reach number one on the Billboard Hot 100. The album has sold approximately 30 million copies worldwide, including 18 million units in the United States, making it the best-selling debut album of all time in the US, as well as the eleventh best-selling album in the United States. The success of the debut was followed by the eight-song album G N' R Lies (1988) which reached number two on the Billboard 200. The twin albums Use Your Illusion I and Use Your Illusion II (1991) debuted at number two and number one on the Billboard 200 respectively and have sold a combined 35 million copies worldwide, including 14 million units in the United States. The cover album \"The Spaghetti Incident?\" (1993) was the band's last studio album to feature Slash and McKagan. After more than a decade of work and several lineup changes, Guns N' Roses released the long-awaited album Chinese Democracy (2008) which, at an estimated $14 million in production costs, is the most expensive rock album to ever be produced in music history. It debuted at number three on the Billboard 200 but undersold industry expectations, despite mostly positive critical reception. Classic era members Slash and McKagan both rejoined the band in 2016. Guns N' Roses has been credited with reviving the mainstream popularity of rock music, at a time when popular music was dominated by dance music and glam metal. Its late 1980s and early 1990s years have been described as the period in which the group brought forth a \"hedonistic rebelliousness\" reminiscent of the early Rolling Stones, a reputation that had earned the group the nickname \"the most dangerous band in the world\". The band's classic lineup, along with later members Reed and drummer Matt Sorum, was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2012, in its first year of eligibility."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Gym Class Heroes are an American rap rock-hip hop band from Geneva, New York, United States. The group formed in 1997 when Travie McCoy met drummer Matt McGinley during their high school gym class. The band's music displays a wide variety of influences, including hip hop, rock, funk, and reggae. After the addition of guitarist Disashi Lumumba-Kasongo and bassist Eric Roberts in 2003, the group was signed to Fueled by Ramen and Decaydance Records (Fall Out Boy bassist Pete Wentz's independent record label), on which they released their debut album, The Papercut Chronicles. The group gained a strong fanbase while promoting the album, appearing at festivals such as The Bamboozle and Warped Tour. In 2006, the group released the gold-selling album As Cruel as School Children. Since that release, the band's single \"Cupid's Chokehold\" reached No. 4 on the Billboard Hot 100, and \"Clothes Off!!\" peaked at No. 5 in the United Kingdom. On September 9, 2008, Gym Class Heroes released their third album, The Quilt, which contained numerous collaborations with other artists. The band went on hiatus in 2009, a time in which the members pursued various side projects. McCoy released his solo debut album Lazarus in June 2010. Lumumba-Kasongo has been working on his side-project Soul, while McGinley now drums in the rock group Kill the Frontman. The group released The Papercut Chronicles II on November 15, 2011. It has since become one of their most successful albums to date."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"HIM (previously known as HER in the United States) is a rock band from Helsinki, Finland. The band was formed in the early 1990s by vocalist Ville Valo and bassist Mikko \"Mige\" Paananen under the name His Infernal Majesty. The band broke up in 1993, but was reformed in 1995 by Valo and guitarist Mikko \"Linde\" Lindstr\u00F6m. After being rejoined by Mige, as well as keyboardist Antto Melasniemi and drummer Juhana \"P\u00E4tk\u00E4\" Rantala, the band, now called HIM, released their debut album Greatest Love Songs Vol. 666 in 1997. In 2000, now with drummer Mika \"Gas Lipstick\" Karppinen and keyboardist Juska Salminen, the band released the album Razorblade Romance, which reached the number-one spot in Finland, Austria and Germany. Its first single, \"Join Me in Death\", also charted at number-one in Finland and Germany, eventually going platinum in their home country. Following the addition of Janne \"Burton\" Puurtinen on keyboards, HIM released Deep Shadows and Brilliant Highlights and Love Metal in 2001 and 2003, respectively. Both cracked the top ten in several countries, with latter being the band's first album to chart in the UK. After relocating to Los Angeles, HIM released Dark Light in 2005, which became the group's most successful album to date, cracking the top ten in five countries. With Dark Light, HIM also became the first-ever Finnish group to receive a gold album in the United States. Dark Light was followed by Venus Doom in 2007, the making of which was marred by personal problems faced by Valo. Despite this, the album gave the band their highest chart position ever in the US at number 12. After 2010's Screamworks: Love in Theory and Practice, HIM were put on hiatus, after drummer Gas Lipstick was diagnosed with a repetitive stress injury and nerve damage in his hands. Following several months of uncertainty, the band regrouped and eventually released the album Tears on Tape in 2013. In 2015, Gas Lipstick announced his departure from the band after 16 years, to pursue other musical projects. He was subsequently replaced by Jukka \"Kosmo\" Kr\u00F6ger. HIM is internationally one of the most commercially successful Finnish bands of all time, with seven platinum and over ten gold albums, and sales of over six million records. The band have released eight studio albums, six compilations, three video releases, and one live and one remix album. HIM's music and their logo, the heartagram, have also appeared in several films and TV series, such as The Thirteenth Floor, Transformers, Viva La Bam and LA Ink."@en ;

In 1998, after releasing multiple EPs and three full-length albums, the band briefly disbanded, but soon reformed, announcing their continuation as Hot Water Music at the concert recorded for Live at the Hardback. They are represented by David \"Beno\" Benveniste's Velvet Hammer Music and Management Group. In late 2005, Hot Water Music stated they were going on a hiatus following Chuck Ragan's departure. On May 13, 2006 however, the hiatus became seemingly permanent and Hot Water Music officially disbanded. The three remaining members then started a new project, The Draft, whose first album, In a Million Pieces, was released on September 12, 2006. Chuck Ragan also continued with a more low-key music career, releasing material through No Idea Records and Side One Dummy Records. He is currently signed to the latter. The band members have also participated in many side projects. The four most popular of these are Blacktop Cadence, Cro(w)s, Unitas and Rumbleseat. A collection of Hot Water Music work on No Idea records has been released, titled Till the Wheels Fall Off . It was released on CD and on LP. According to Jason Black in an interview with Alternative Press, the compilation will feature \"a song [called \"Home\"] that hasn't come out anywhere...it was one of two that didn't make it [onto The New What Next].\" The band's name was taken from the collection of short stories by Charles Bukowski of the same name."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Iced Earth is an American heavy metal band from Tampa, Florida. It was formed in 1985 under the name Purgatory by guitarist and main songwriter Jon Schaffer and original drummer Greg Seymour. Iced Earth released their debut album in 1990 and have since released eleven studio albums, four EPs, three compilations, three box sets, three live albums and one cover album. After releasing their first two studio albums in 1990 and 1991, respectively, Iced Earth took a three-year layoff from 1992 to 1995, after which the band returned with new lead vocalist Matt Barlow. Iced Earth went on to release four studio albums with Barlow between 1995 and 2001, respectively; 1995's Burnt Offerings, 1996's The Dark Saga, 1998's Something Wicked This Way Comes and 2001's Horror Show. After Horror Show, Barlow quit the band and joined the police force, while Iced Earth continued on with Tim \"Ripper\" Owens, of Judas Priest fame, on vocals. With Owens, the band released two studio albums (2004's The Glorious Burden and 2007's Framing Armageddon). In late 2007, Matt Barlow rejoined the band. Iced Earth recorded the album The Crucible of Man with Barlow in 2008. In 2011 Barlow left the band again. Later that year, Into Eternity frontman Stu Block became Iced Earth's new lead vocalist. Dystopia, Block's first album with the group, was released in October 2011. It received a positive response; some critics called Dystopia one of Iced Earth's best albums. Block's second album with the group, Plagues of Babylon, was released in January 2014. Before arriving at their current lineup, Iced Earth has had numerous line-up changes, with founder Jon Schaffer staying as the last remaining member. As of 2013, there have been over twenty musicians in and out of Iced Earth since its formation in 1985 (see: List of Iced Earth band members for more details). Currently, the band is composed of rhythm guitarist Jon Schaffer, lead guitarist Jake Dreyer, singer Stu Block, bassist Luke Appleton and drummer Brent Smedley."@en ;

The band achieved commercial success, not only in Australia but also in the United States. They have sold more than 30 million records; six studio albums reached the top 10 on the Australian Kent Music Report albums chart including Diamantina Cocktail (April 1977) and First Under the Wire (July 1979), which both peaked at No. 2. Nine singles appeared in the top 20 on the related singles chart, with \"Help Is on Its Way\" (1977) as their only number-one hit. Ten singles reached the top 20 on the Billboard Hot 100 with \"Reminiscing\" their highest peaking at No. 3. Only First Under the Wire appeared in the top 10 albums on the Billboard 200. Early members were Beeb Birtles, Ric Formosa, Graeham Goble, Roger McLachlan, Derek Pellicci and Glenn Shorrock. Most of the group's 1970s and 1980s material was written by Goble and/or Shorrock, with contributions from Birtles, David Briggs (who replaced Formosa) and Pellicci. Little River Band have received many music awards in Australia. In May 2001 the Australasian Performing Right Association (APRA), as part of its 75th anniversary celebrations, named \"Cool Change\", written by Shorrock, as one of the Top 30 Australian songs of all time. The 1976 line-up of Birtles, Briggs, Goble, Pellicci, Shorrock and George McArdle (who replaced McLachlan), were inducted into the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) Hall of Fame at the 18th Annual ARIA Music Awards of 2004. Little River Band have undergone numerous personnel changes, with over 30 members since their formation. None of the musicians now performing as Little River Band are original members. In the 1980s members included John Farnham, David Hirschfelder, Stephen Housden, Wayne Nelson and Steve Prestwich. As of March 2015 the line-up is Nelson with Rich Herring, Greg Hind, Chris Marion and Ryan Ricks. Two former members have died, Barry Sullivan in October 2003 (aged 57) and Prestwich in January 2011 (aged 56)."@en ;

Previous bassists for the band include John Nichols from 1993 to 1994; Zak Sally from 1994 to 2005 and Matt Livingston from 2005 to 2008. The music of Low is characterized by slow tempos and minimalist arrangements. Early descriptions sometimes referred to it as a rock subgenre called \"slowcore\" often compared to the band Bedhead, who played this style during the 1980s and early 1990s. However, Low's members ultimately disapproved of the term. Parker and Sparhawk's striking vocal harmonies represent perhaps the group's most distinctive element; critic Denise Sullivan writes that their shared vocals are \"as chilling as anything Gram and Emmylou ever conspired on\u2014though that's not to say it's country-tinged, just straight from the heart.\""@en ;

Their lineup has consisted of Daisuke-han, Nao, Maximum the Ryo-kun, and Ue-chan since 1999. Each member alternates singing lead vocals, often within the same song, with the exception of Ue-chan, who provides backup vocals almost exclusively. The group is best known for their unconventional and experimental style of alternative metal music. Over their career, they have found success incorporating elements of heavy metal, hardcore punk, pop, funk, hip hop and ska into their sound. Stylistically, their music runs the gamut from being dark and serious, to ironic or humorous, often with drastic shifts in tempo and mood over the course of a song. Their music videos often have a tongue-in-cheek aspect as well, such as \"Rolling1000t00n\", which features an underdog (with the requisite karate training montage) facing up to a bully, or \"Koi no Mega Lover\", which features an awkward young man whose clumsy amorous advances are rejected by a beautiful girl at a party."@en ;

John, Shyam and Saadat played their first gig together in January 2001, and since then have shared the stage with numerous groups across numerous states, including the Dismemberment Plan, the Brian Jonestown Massacre, Bardo Pond, Tristeza, Gogogo Airheart, Wolf Colonel, The Bravery, The Rosebuds, Shout Out Louds, and Bis. Metropolitan released their second full-length album, \"Down For You Is Up,\" in March 2002. The album was recorded at Inner Ear Studios in Arlington, Virginia and produced by Chad Clark (Dismemberment Plan, Fugazi, Beauty Pill). The third full-length, \"The Lines They Get Broken,\" was released in 2005. It was produced by Archie Moore (Velocity Girl) and Jason Caddell (Dismemberment Plan). Continuing to expand, Miguel Lacsamana joined the group in 2005 as well, adding additional guitar and keyboard talent to fill out the live sound."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"The Modern Jazz Quartet (MJQ) was a jazz combo established in 1952 that played music influenced by classical, cool jazz, blues and bebop. The band performed over a 40-year span with only one personnel change. For the majority of their career the group comprised John Lewis (piano and musical director), Milt Jackson (vibraphone), Percy Heath (double bass) and Connie Kay (drums). Under Lewis's leadership they carved their own niche by specializing in elegant, restrained music that used sophisticated counterpoint yet nonetheless retained a strong blues feel. Lewis firmly believed that J.S. Bach and the blues were compatible, combining classical form with jazz improvisation and polyphony. The band was also noted for its ability to play alongside a variety of other groups. Initially active into the 1970s until Jackson quit due to creative disagreement and frustration with their busy touring schedule in 1974, the MJQ reformed intermittently into the 1990s."@en ;

Muse released their debut album, Showbiz, in 1999, showcasing Bellamy's falsetto and a melancholic alternative rock style. Their second album, Origin of Symmetry (2001), expanded their sound, incorporating wider instrumentation and romantic classical influences, and earned them a reputation for energetic live performances. Absolution (2003) saw further classical influence, with orchestra on tracks such as \"Butterflies and Hurricanes\". The first of five consecutive UK number one albums, it also brought them American success. Black Holes and Revelations (2006) incorporated electronic and pop elements, influenced by 1980s groups such as Depeche Mode, which is displayed in singles such as \"Supermassive Black Hole\". The Resistance (2009) and The 2nd Law (2012), explored themes of government oppression and civil uprising and cemented Muse as one of the world's major stadium acts. Their seventh album, Drones (2015), was a concept album about drone warfare and returned to a harder rock sound. Muse have won numerous awards, including two Grammy Awards, winning the Grammys for Best Rock Album for The Resistance and Drones, two Brit Awards, winning Best British Live Act twice, five MTV Europe Music Awards and eight NME Awards.

For their early studio albums and live performances, the band was often accompanied by music programmer Hideki Matsutake. Each of its members were seasoned veterans of the music industry before Hosono formed the band as a one-off exploration of computerized exotica, initially paying tribute to performers such as Les Baxter and Martin Denny while also parodying Western conceptions of the orient. Over the course of YMO's career, the group continued to embrace new technologies, fusing them with classic pop forms, and indulging in sociopolitical, technological, or musical subversion. They are often considered influential innovators in the field of popular electronic music. They contributed to the development of synthpop, ambient house, electronica, electro, contemporary J-pop, house, techno, and hip hop music. More broadly, their influence is evident across various genres of popular music, including electronic dance, ambient music, chiptune, game music, and pop music. YMO were pioneers in their use of synthesizers, samplers, sequencers, drum machines, computers, and digital recording technology in popular music, during a time when these technologies were seen as novelties. The band is considered \"ahead of their time,\" for anticipating the global trend towards drum machines and sampling, for having anticipated the \"electropop boom\" of the 1980s, their \"pro-technological viewpoint,\" their use of video game sounds and bleeps, and for experimenting heavily with computers and electronic instruments."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Pennywise is an American punk rock band from Hermosa Beach, California, United States, formed in 1988. The name is derived from the monster, It, from the Stephen King novel of the same title. Between their 1991 self-titled debut and 2005's The Fuse, Pennywise had released an album every two years on Epitaph Records, a label owned by Bad Religion guitarist Brett Gurewitz. To date, the band has released eleven full-length studio albums (the last being 2014's Yesterdays), one live album, two EPs and one DVD. Although their first two studio albums were critically acclaimed, Pennywise would not experience worldwide commercial success until the 1995 release of their third studio album, About Time, which peaked at number ninety-six on the Billboard 200, and number fifty-five on Australia's ARIA Charts. The band's mainstream success was signified by a growing interest in punk rock during the 1990s, along with fellow California bands NOFX, Rancid, Blink-182, Bad Religion, Green Day, The Offspring, Lagwagon and Sublime. By 2007, the band had independently sold over three million records worldwide, making them one of the most successful independent punk acts of all time. Pennywise's current line-up consists of Jim Lindberg (vocals), Fletcher Dragge (guitars), Randy Bradbury (bass) and Byron McMackin (drums). They had kept their original line-up together until bassist Jason Thirsk died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound in 1996, due to issues with his alcoholism, after which Bradbury joined as his replacement. In August 2009, Lindberg decided to leave the band; he was replaced in February 2010 by Ignite singer Zoli T\u00E9gl\u00E1s. With T\u00E9gl\u00E1s, the band recorded their tenth studio album All or Nothing, which was released on May 1, 2012. Lindberg rejoined the band later that year after T\u00E9gl\u00E1s was sidelined by a back injury."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Phuture is an American, Chicago-based acid-house group, founded in 1985 by Spanky, DJ Pierre and Herb J. The group's 12-minute track \"Acid Tracks\" (1987) is one of several recordings that lay claim to being the first-ever acid house record. \"Acid Tracks\" featured characteristic bass lines from the Roland TB-303 bass synthesizer\u2014which was manipulated to produce resonant and squelchy sounds uncharacteristic for a bass guitar it was designed to emulate. The track rose to popularity at DJ Ron Hardy's Music Box club in Chicago and has since been re-pressed many times. Phuture released a great number of acid tracks now considered classics, usually as 12-inch vinyl maxi singles. The music the group produces is dark and monotonous. Many tracks are very long, even passing the 10-minute mark (such as \"Acid Tracks\"). Sparse lyrics are occasionally related to drugs, like the lyrics of \"Your Only Friend\" (1987), which describe cocaine addiction, or a simple chant, such as on \"Spirit\" (1994). The group also recorded under several pseudonyms, generally using the substitution of ph or pf for f. For example, the name Phortune or Pfortune."@en ;

The Big Tymers consisted of Cash Money Records co-founder Birdman and former Cash Money in-house producer Mannie Fresh. Baby later changed his stage name to Birdman after the duo was dissolved. The Big Tymers released their debut album in 1997 titled How You Luv That, and a re-release version of their debut album, How You Luv That Vol. 2 which gave them an abundant amount of publicity afterwards. They recorded their first platinum-selling album in 2000 titled I Got That Work. The lead single from I Got That Work, \"Number One Stunna\" peaked at No. 24 on the Billboard Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Singles & Tracks. The group released its most successful album in 2002 titled Hood Rich. The album reached No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 200 and spawned a major hit in \"Still Fly\" which reached No. 11 on the Billboard Hot 100. Later in 2002, Mannie Fresh resigned from Cash Money Records because of financial dispute with Birdman, and his brother Slim. The group later reunited again in 2003 for their final album titled Big Money Heavyweight. During an appearance on MTV RapFix, Lil Wayne announced that there will be a Big Tymers album featuring Birdman, himself, and Drake. Birdman stated that Mannie Fresh will not be a part of the project. The project is now unlikely to happen, due to the fading relationship between Birdman and Lil Wayne."@en ;

Though the Kittens saw little commercial success during their period of activity, they have since won praise as \"[a]rguably the best American band who never made it\" in the '90s heyday of alternative rock. In the 1995 movie Empire Records, the character Mark, played by Ethan Embry, is wearing a \"Chainsaw Kittens\" t-shirt throughout the movie.

The band began to receive national attention in Denmark around the time of the full-length release, and began touring Germany in 2003. Their second full-length, Skeleton, was released in 2005 on Danish label Morningside Records and German label Pop-U-Loud, and on US label The Control Group in 2006. The band began a North American tour after being nominated for a Canadian Music Week Indie award and has since performed at the Indies ceremony, SXSW, KEXP, and in cities in the US, Canada, and Europe. The band has also received positive press from Pitchfork Media, The New York Times, and Spin, among others. Figurines's sound has been most often compared to that of Pavement, Modest Mouse, and Built to Spill. The band released their third record When the Deer Wore Blue in 2007 with Chicago-based co-producer/engineer Jeremy Lemos, who has worked with Smog, Jim O'Rourke, Loose Fur, and many other Windy City acts in the past. The new material is more psychedelic than previous efforts, but remains faithful to the melodic-pop sounds of Skeleton and Shake a Mountain on several tracks, including \"Hey, Girl\", the first single from the record. In 2010 they released their 4th record titled \"Figurines\"."@en ;

Until his death in 2008, the band often featured guest vocals and percussion by Jimmy Carl Black, former drummer and vocalist from Zappa's Mothers of Invention, with whom they also performed songs by Captain Beefheart. Since their debut, the Muffin Men have featured no less than seven original Zappa band members, along with original Mothers Of Invention drummer/vocalist Jimmy Carl Black, as well as performing with Don Preston and Bunk Gardner in 1993. In 1994 they played a nine-week European tour with guest vocalist Ike Willis, and again teamed up with Willis in 2003 for a special Zappanale festival show, which also featured Napoleon Murphy Brock. (Zappanale is a yearly tribute concert festival dedicated to Frank Zappa's compositions.) Mike Keneally has also appeared with the band, along with Ray White, and Robert Martin. Denny Walley has performed on several occasions since 2010. Rather than play pieces note-for-note, the band plays Zappa's material working to the strengths of the current line-up, often giving the music a different slant to the original versions. 25th anniversary gigs (2015) feature a core line-up of 3 original members - Rhino, Jumpy and Roddie, with Phil Hearn on keys."@en ;

The YC's were influenced not only by the other punk bands in town at that time such as D.O.A. and the Pointed Sticks, but also by the Dolls, the Stooges, and 1960s garage rock. Although the band only recorded two EPs and a single before breaking up, their single \"Hawaii\" is one of the classic Canadian punk anthems. Historically significant (at least to the Vancouver scene), The K-Tels were the first punk band to play the Smilin' Buddha. They also supported the Boomtown Rats on a tour across Canada. Just before the release of Hawaii, they were forced to change their name when threatened with legal action by the K-Tel corporation. The band's leader and songwriter was Art Bergmann, who went on to become one of the key figures in Canadian alternative rock in the 1980s and 1990s. Founding member and bassist Jim Bescott died in an accident in Vancouver on August 31, 2005 at the age of 52. Their two EPs and single, plus unreleased live tracks, were re-released in 1995 on the album No Escape, with liner notes written by Buck Cherry.

In the Spring of 2002, a Popstars competition was held in Finland to find members to form a pop band. 454 young women participated in the singing trials. 25 girls made it to the final selection round. Members of the first Popstars band in Finland were Jenni Vartiainen, Susanna Korvala, Ushma Karnani, and Jonna Pirinen. After a few weeks arguments between the girls increased, and Jonna decided to leave the band for a solo career. Ushma, Susanna, and Jenni continued. They decided to adopt the name Gimmel. Gimmel is the third letter in the Hebrew alphabet, and it also means the number three. A gimmel ring was a Renaissance betrothal and wedding ring made in three parts, or two. The band's debut single \"Etsit muijaa seuraavaa\" was released on 25 October 2002. It sold gold in a few days and platinum in one and a half weeks. In its first week on the charts, the single peaked at number one the Finnish Singles Chart and held that position for four weeks. Gimmel's first album Lentoon came out on 22 November 2002 and, just after it was published, it went to the number one spot in the Finnish Albums Chart, remaining there for three weeks. In 2002, the album sold almost 85 000 copies, becoming the best-selling album of the year. Gimmel's second single Roviolla was released on 27 January 2003 and it peaked at number three on the Singles Chart. The single features a previously unpublished piece called Tatuointi. At the 2003 Emma Awards, the band won the Awards for New Pop/Rock Artist of the Year, Debut Album of the Year and Best-Selling Album of the Year. In the summer of 2003, they released their second album Kaksi kertaa enemm\u00E4n, and in the end of the year a music video Harmaata lunta. The band broke up on 16 October 2004."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"The Doug Anthony All Stars (or Doug Anthony Allstars, DAAS, D.A.A.S. or stylised as D\u22C6A\u2020A\u262DS) are an Australian musical comedy, alternative rock and vocal group who initially performed together between 1984 and 1994. The band is an acoustic trio, originally comprising Paul McDermott and Tim Ferguson on main vocals and Richard Fidler on guitar and backing vocals. The 2014 DAAS Live reformation tour features Paul Livingston (aka Flacco) on guitar and vibes. DAAS are known for their aggressive, provocative style; their habit of involving audience members and their tendency to attack topical and sometimes controversial issues in their comedy. DAAS began performing as buskers on the streets of Canberra in 1984, while they were attending university. After winning the Pick of the Fringe award at the 1986 Adelaide Fringe Festival, the group relocated from Canberra to Melbourne, but it was not until they travelled to the Edinburgh Festival Fringe in 1987 that they first achieved success. They quickly gained popularity in the United Kingdom, where they made numerous television appearances, but remained virtually unknown in Australia until 1989 when they were made regular performers on the Australian comedy show The Big Gig. These appearances gained them recognition, and they remained a popular feature of the show until 1991 when they left to create their own ABC comedy series, DAAS Kapital. The group have released four live recordings and one studio album, DAAS Icon, which achieved some independent success in Australia but was briefly banned in Britain. They also released a collection of dark short stories in 1989, entitled Book, which took a markedly different tone from their comedic stage performances. They also made two live concert videos and one film, The Edinburgh Years. The group split up in 1994, following a final farewell tour of Australia. Although they reunited in 2003 to perform together at a benefit concert, were interviewed together in 2008 in support of their DVD, and reunited for a one-off show to launch the DAAS Kapital DVD in 2013, the three ruled out the suggestion of a reunion tour at the time. In December 2013, McDermott and Ferguson announced they would be performing \"as DAAS\" for the group's 30th anniversary, at the Canberra Comedy Festival in March 2014, with Paul Livingston performing the role of Fidler. This current line-up has announced subsequent shows in Hobart, Melbourne, Wollongong, Perth, Brisbane and Bendigo, with more dates to follow."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Alter Ego is the original Peruvian neo-progressive rock band whose style goes from the ever changing art rock from the 1990s mixed with new sounds from the 1970s. Their style crosses between symphonic rock, hard rock to power ballads and R&B. The band was founded in 1992 by pianist/composer and lead singer Juan Carlos Oganes in Per\u00FA (South America), who assembled five other musicians and developed a sound that was rare for the time in that part of the world. They combined much of the anthem-type compositions of Juan Carlos Oganes with nice and lush vocal harmonies in the style of Queen and Yes. The album was produced by him and recorded at Emporium Digital Studios. Alter Ego paid much attention to theatrics and used the cinematographic expertise of Oganes -to create a sense of audiovisual entertainment. Oganes also directed their videos. They recorded much material since their first years and many of those songs ended in their 1997 debut album called Utopia. By the end of the 1990s, friction within the band led to their momentary split in 2000. Some time after, a new line up was to be formed by Oganes to play new material which was supposed to be released as an album called 'Cinema' back in 1999 before their split. A new album is scheduled to be out by the middle of this decade. Juan Carlos Oganes is also known as an actor, audiovisual producer and filmmaker having directed some short and feature films with his company Emporium Digital Studios."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Angels & Airwaves is an American supergroup, currently featuring Tom DeLonge (guitarist, keyboardist and vocalist) and Ilan Rubin (drummer, keyboardist, guitarist, bassist and backing vocalist). Former members are Ryan Sinn (bassist), Adam \"Atom\" Willard (drummer), Matt Wachter (bassist). The status of David Kennedy (guitarist) and Eddie Breckenridge (bassist) is currently unknown. The band formed after Blink-182 went on hiatus in 2005. They continued to record and tour despite DeLonge reigniting his career with Blink-182 in 2009, and after DeLonge subsequently parted with Blink in 2015, he began to focus on Angels & Airwaves more extensively. The band has released five studio albums We Don't Need to Whisper (2006), I-Empire (2007), Love (2010), Love: Part Two (2011) and The Dream Walker (2014). The project also resulted in the documentary film Start the Machine (2008). In 2011, accompanying the two Love albums, the group scored and produced the science fiction drama film Love by director William Eubank in 460 theatres nationwide during their multimedia event, Love Live. The band released an animated short named Poet Anderson: The Dream Walker and their fifth album, The Dream Walker, on December 9. Other related media, such as comic books and a live-action film, are to follow in 2015. The group has been described by DeLonge as more than a band, but more accurately \"an art project [that approaches] larger human themes and tackles them in different mediums\"(sic), or simply \"a multimedia project\". This has been seen in the group's films, live events, and novel approach to fan-artist interaction. Of the first two albums, the band says that they were mainly influenced by the music of Radiohead and Pink Floyd, combining them with the grandiosity of U2. Of the first album, Delonge said that it would be \"the best music in generations\", but afterwards admitted that during this time he was addicted to painkillers."@en ;

Influences include 1960s garage rock bands such as The Sonics, The Standells and Shadows of Knight, The Velvet Underground, The Stooges and New York Dolls; and punk rock bands such as The Damned, The Heartbreakers and The Saints; and early hardcore punk bands such as Black Flag, Bad Brains and Dead Kennedys. \"Demons\" has often been compared to contemporary groups like New Bomb Turks, The Hellacopters and Electric Frankenstein. The band established themselves in the mid-1990s Swedish punk/garage rock scene with releases such as Electrocute and \"Demons\"... Come Bursting Out!. \"Demons\" initially gained more popularity in the United States than in their homeland, and thus much of their music has been released on American record labels, most notably Gearhead Records based in Oakland, California. They have completed several US and European tours, including two appearances at SXSW."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Keane are an English rock band from Battle, East Sussex, formed in 1995. The group currently comprises Tim Rice-Oxley (piano, synthesisers, backing vocals), Richard Hughes (drums, percussion, backing vocals), Jesse Quin (bass guitar, acoustic/electric guitar, backing vocals) and Tom Chaplin (lead vocals, acoustic/electric guitar). Their original line-up included founder and guitarist Dominic Scott, who left in 2001. Keane achieved mainstream, international success with the release of their debut album, Hopes and Fears, in 2004. Topping the UK charts, the album won the 2005 Brit Award for Best British Album and was the second best-selling British album of 2004. Their second album, Under the Iron Sea, released in 2006, topped the UK album charts and debuting at number four on the US Billboard 200. Their third album, Perfect Symmetry, was released in October 2008. In May 2008, both Hopes and Fears (number 13) and Under the Iron Sea (number 8) were voted by readers of Q magazine as among the best British albums ever, with Keane, The Beatles, Oasis and Radiohead the only artists having two albums in the top 20. In 2009, Hopes and Fears was listed as the ninth best-selling album of the 2000s decade in the UK. Their EP, Night Train, was released in May 2010. Their fourth studio album, Strangeland, was released in May 2012, and again peaked at number one on the UK Albums Chart. Keane are known for using a piano (or a synth) as the lead instrument instead of guitars, differentiating them from most other rock bands. The inclusion of a distorted piano effect in 2006 and various synthesisers were a common feature in their music that back then combined the piano rock sound used during their first album and the more electronic sound which developed on the second and third albums. Since the start of their career, the band have sold over 10 million albums worldwide."@en ;

For a time, the band featured Christian themes in their music and was regarded as a Christian band, however this theme was eventually met with debate among the members and the band currently no longer considers themselves a \"Christian band\". To date, Zao has released ten full-length albums, four EPs, a two-disc DVD documentary and multiple concert tours, garnering a limited but global fanbase and earning critical praise in the process."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"MOJOFLY is a now defunct pop-rock band from the Philippines. Formed in '99 by bassist Ricci Gurango after his departure from Hungry Young Poets, MOJOFLY reeled in mainstream and alternative crowds alike with the debut album Birth Day (1999) and follow-up A Million Stories (2002), both released under Sony BMG Philippines. Then-lead singer Kitchie Nadal helped propel singles such as Another Day and Scooter Boy to national recognition. But in May 2003, Nadal left the group to embark on a solo career. Mojofly then introduced Lougee Basabas as the band\u2019s new frontwoman in only a matter of days. By year\u2019s end the group joined the \u201Cindie\u201D bandwagon with their self-titled EP, sold-out despite being available only in gigs. Because of Mata and the revived, revv-ed up Lougee-version of Minamalas, MOJOFLY (EP) showed the new sound of their group. The band went on to release an LP aptly entitled MOJOFLY Now (June, 2005), still under independent label luKas Music of artist manager and music publisher Karin Araneta. This time distributed nationwide by EMI Music Philippines, Lougee took over the reins in songwriting and gained MOJOFLY \u201Cstreet cred\u201D through her novel, cutting-edge compositions. Currently promoting MOJOFLY Now Special Edition (August, 2006), the 2-disc package marries the original \u201805 full-length and an A-VCD featuring live tracks from their first major concert at the Music Museum (September, 2005) and the 3D-animated music video of Tumatakbo. MOJOFLY is the first local artist to venture into full 3D animation in Philippine music video history. The work was previewed at the 19th Singapore International Film Festival (April, 2006) and won Best Animated Video and Favorite Indie Video at the MTV Pilipinas Video Music Awards 2006] (August, 2006). Apart from once garnering the much-coveted slot for MTV Lokal Artist-of-the-Month (March, 2005), MOJOFLY also boasts a list of celebrity endorsements from Del Monte Pizza Sauce to Penshoppe and Cream Silk Conditioners. The theme song Choose and vast multi-media exposure from the Cream Silk \u201CGirl Power, Pink Power\u201D campaign brought MOJOFLY\u2019s sound and Lougee\u2019s vivid image into every household. On 2008, Ricci Gurango, the last original member of MOJOFLY, left the band. The remaining members took in Richard Carandang and Ace Evangelista to play the bass and lead guitar. With the new members, the band decided to rename their group as Delara."@en ;

The amalgamation of these three names, of these three semantic ideas, is the word Berrog\u00FCetto, that would come to mean the shout of the ghetto - the oppressed ones.

The band originally formed in 2007 as Inflikted but changed its name for legal reasons. The group's creation marked the end of a 10-year feud between the Cavalera brothers who founded Sepultura in the early 1980s. Following the brothers' falling out, Max had formed a new band, Soulfly, and Igor had recorded four studio albums with Sepultura before leaving the band in January 2006. In July 2006, Max received an unexpected call from his brother, and by the end of the conversation, Max had invited Igor to visit him in Phoenix, Arizona, to perform in a Soulfly show. Igor joined Soulfly in concert and performed two Sepultura songs. After the show, Max suggested they begin a new project, and Igor accepted. To complete the band, Max chose Soulfly guitarist Marc Rizzo and the Gojira frontman Joe Duplantier to play bass guitar. The group then recorded their debut album at Undercity Studios in Los Angeles with engineer and co-producer Logan Mader in July 2007. Named after the band's original moniker, Inflikted was released through Roadrunner Records on 25 March 2008."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Deerhunter is an American indie rock band from Atlanta, Georgia, formed in 2001. The band consists of Bradford Cox (vocals, guitar, keyboards), Moses Archuleta (drums), Lockett Pundt (guitar, vocals), Josh McKay (bass), Javier Morales (keys, sax) and Rhasaan Manning (percussion). Founded by Cox and Archuleta, Deerhunter's first stable line-up included guitarist Colin Mee and bass guitarist Justin Bosworth. After recording a split EP with Alphabets, Bosworth died of head injuries, suffered during a skateboarding accident. His death influenced the recording of the band's first studio album, Turn It Up Faggot (2005), with Josh Fauver occupying the vacant role of bass guitarist. Following the album's release, Cox asked childhood friend, Lockett Pundt, to join Deerhunter as its second guitarist and occasional lead vocalist. Recorded in two days, the band's follow-up, Cryptograms (2007), combined ambient work and indie rock songs. The release was quickly followed by the EP, Fluorescent Grey. While touring the releases, Mee departed from Deerhunter, due to disagreements over the band's schedule, but rejoined soon after. Deerhunter released two studio albums, Microcastle and Weird Era Cont., in 2008. Both albums were recorded without the participation of Mee, who again departed for a second and final time. The band enlisted former cheerleader and high school friend of Cox, Whitney Petty, as his touring replacement. Recorded as a four-piece with producer Ben H. Allen, the band's fourth studio album, Halcyon Digest (2010), was released to widespread critical acclaim. In 2012, the departure of long-time bassist Fauver placed the band's future in doubt. Cox, Pundt and Archuleta regrouped with new members, bassist Josh McKay and guitarist Frankie Broyles, to record the garage rock-influenced Monomania (2013). The following year, Cox suffered a serious car crash which greatly influenced the band's seventh studio album, Fading Frontier (2015). Deerhunter have described themselves as \"ambient punk,\" though they incorporate a wide range of genres, including noise rock, garage rock, art rock, shoegaze, and post-punk, as well as significant pop elements."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Die! Die! Die! is a New Zealand noise pop/punk/post-punk band from Dunedin, formed in late 2003 and initially signed to Capital Recordings. The band has its origins in Carriage H, a Dunedin high school band which was formed in 1999 and made the finals of the 2000 Pepsismokefree Rockquest. Band members were Andrew Wilson (bass)Tiddy Smith (guitar, vocals), and Michael Prain (drums). Carriage H released one EP, Power of Grey Skull in 2002 and disbanded shortly afterwards. Wilson and Prain then formed Die! Die! Die! Their self-titled album Die! Die! Die! was released in 2005 in New Zealand, with an international release soon after. It was recorded in Chicago's Electrical Audio by Steve Albini. 2006 saw the release of the four-track EP Locust Weeks. This EP was included in the British release of the album, released by Pet Piranha Records. The band's second album, Promises, Promises was released in New Zealand in October 2007, and worldwide shortly after. Produced by Shayne Carter (Straitjacket Fits, Dimmer), the album saw the band move away from the more hardcore tendencies of their first record towards a more bass- and drum-heavy sound, helped in part by new bassist Lachlan Anderson. After touring relentlessly for almost three years worldwide, the band completed their third album Form in August 2009, which was released on Flying Nun Records in July 2010. Form debuted at number 1 on the independent charts and number 19 on the National Album charts. Produced by Nick Roughan of Skeptics, the album garnered critical acclaim (including Roughan and the band winning Producer in the 2011 New Zealand Music Awards and a nomination the same year for Best Alternative Album. The album saw the band move further towards the sound they began on Promises, Promises. The band's fourth album, Harmony, recorded in late 2010, was released in August 2012. It was also shortlisted for the 2011 Taite Music Prize. All the band's releases prior to Form are available on American Label SAF Records. Die! Die! Die! have toured with Franz Ferdinand, Slint, The Brian Jonestown Massacre, Wolfmother and The Blood Brothers, and have played several major festivals around the world including spots at SXSW and Incubate."@en ;

They reached their peak of popularity with their album The World Is Ours, released in 2000; the videos for singles \"Here Comes The Pain\" and \"If You Ever Leave Me Standing\" were put into heavy rotation by German alternative music channels such as VIVA Zwei. Farmer Boys has obtained a cult following in later years. Their musical style is a blend of Machine Head's groove metal and Paradise Lost's gothic metal; their lyrical matter, however, unusually to the style, often revolves around the darker side of agriculture - bestiality (\"Farm Sweet Farm\"), torture of animals (\"When a Chicken Cries For Love\"), suicide (\"Relieve the Tension)\" and slaughterhouses (\"When Pigs Fly\"). Their later albums have strayed away from the subject matter. Matthias Sayer also provided guest vocals for Apocalyptica's single Hope Vol.2. As of June 2007, very little news regarding the band has been forthcoming since the release of The Other Side in 2004. There are concerns amongst the fans that the band has split up, however there has been no formal press release regarding this. In 2008 after four years had passed since the release of The Other Side the group performed a reunion concert in Stuttgart on 22 December. Having been silent since 2008, however, in 2011 the band played a concert at Summer Breeze Open Air, on 20 August in Dinkelsb\u00FChl, Germany. No official statement was made concerning about new possible studio album or the future of the band."@en ;

The Band used to be called \"The Ghosts\", but changed their name to Ghostwood \"because 7 million other bands already have the name 'Ghosts'.\". They played their last show under the former name with Lost Valentinos at the Sydney Club The Annandale on 18 May 2007. Ghostwood's first release is their eponymous EP, with tracks Red Version, Blue Version, Ghost, Run and Pencils. The single Red Version was iTunes single of the week in late August 2007. Some say that all the songs on the EP are about Pok\u00E9mon, as emphasised by the titles, all of which except Pencils reference the video game series. Gabby (Vocalist and songwriter for the band) has stated in an interview that the song Red Version is about the Pok\u00E9mon Trading Card Game, but Blue Version is not. Throughout 2011 Ghostwood have had high rotation Radio play on Australia's triple j with new songs \" Sunset Mirage\" & \" Cutlass\", the first of new tracks to be released along with the 3rd & EP titled track \" I am Overcast\" in June 2011."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Jaffa Phonix are a Palestinian band whose music consists of electronica, hip hop and big beat. The current band members are Faisal Abu Ghaben (composer/vocalist), Ali Abu Ghaben (lyricist/vocalist), DJ Feedo (turntablist). The Ghaben brothers were born in Kuwait and fled to Egypt after the Gulf War, because of the PLO's support of Saddam Hussein. The lyrics on their first album, Resolution 194, dealt with the Palestinian refugees' cause and the effects on Palestinian society after Nakba. After several live performances, the band started to deviate from hip hop to a style which combined big beat and dance instrumentals with varied lyrical elements. Jaffa Phonix first emerged from the underground hip/hop scene in Egypt, and garnered mainstream recognition after a track from their first album, \"Osti\" (My Story), was played on the Egypt's biggest radio station, Nile FM. The band's performance took place in Cairo, November 24, 2006, was in front of almost 15,000 people at the second SOS music festival."@en ;

The band's vocalist Erkki Sepp\u00E4nen speaks fluent Russian after his years at Oxford University and working in the embassy in Moscow. The other members of the band are ex-Sentenced members Sami Lopakka (guitar) and Sami Kukkohovi, bassist Jaakko Yl\u00E4-Rautio and drummer Antti Karihtala. KYPCK's debut album \"\u0427\u0435\u0440\u043D\u043E\" (Cherno, Black) was released in 2008, their second album \"\u041D\u0438\u0436\u0435\" (Nizhe, Lower) in 2011, and their third \"\u0418\u043C\u0435\u043D\u0430 \u043D\u0430 \u0441\u0442\u0435\u043D\u0435\" (Imena na Stene, The Names on the Wall) in 2014. The band's fourth album will be released in the autumn of 2016. The experienced outfit is something out of the ordinary on stage, as well. KYPCK's live performances have been distinctive from the very beginning, including Soviet Era video projections and peculiar instruments like bassist Yl\u00E4-Rautio's 1-stringed bass Kypcklop, and guitarist Lopakka's 6-stringer, built by Amfisound Guitars, around a genuine Kalashnikov AK-47 assault rifle. KYPCK have created their own genre Doomsday Metal and broken numerous barriers on their way: The first album sang entirely in the Russian language to have been released worldwide. The lengthiest Russian tour ever by a Western band - from St. Petersburg to Siberia's Irkutsk. Songs on the playlist of Russia's biggest rock radio station, who have strictly ruled out including non-Russian bands in their playlist rotation. In 2015, the band was banned from entering Belarus. All of KYPCK's albums include cyrillic Russian lyrics and English translations in the booklet of the album."@en ;

The band plays a mix of rock, ska, jazz, salsa, folk, rap, reggae, funk and cumbia. The lineup has changed over the years, but the main members have always been the co-founders: singer Guillermo Ogalde Gluzman (known as Goy karamelo) and Mario Yarke. The band has collaborated with several famous musicians, such as Manu Chao, Fermin Muguruza, Sergent Garcia, Ska-P and David Byrne. With Todos Tus Muertos, Kortatu and Mano Negra, they are among the most influential bands of the Latin punk rock world."@en ;

Although Nightwish has been prominent in their home country since the release of their first single, \u201CThe Carpenter\u201D (1997) and debut album Angels Fall First, they did not achieve worldwide fame until the release of the albums Oceanborn, Wishmaster and Century Child, which were released in 1998, 2000 and 2002 respectively. Their 2004 album, Once, which has sold more than 1.2 million copies, led to Nightwish video clips being shown on MTV in the United States and inclusion of their music in US movie soundtracks. Their biggest US hit single, \u201CWish I Had an Angel\u201D (2004), made it onto three US film soundtracks as a means to promote their North American tour. The band produced three more singles and two music videos for the album, as well as \u201CSleeping Sun\u201D, from the 2005 \u201Cbest of\u201D compilation album, Highest Hopes, prior to vocalist Tarja Turunen\u2019s dismissal. In May 2007, former Alyson Avenue frontwoman, Anette Olzon, was revealed as Turunen\u2019s replacement, and in the autumn, the band released a new album \u2013 Dark Passion Play, which has sold more than 1.5 million copies. The supporting tour started on October 6, 2007 and ended on September 19, 2009. A new E.P./live album, Made in Hong Kong (And in Various Other Places), was released in March 2009 as a MCD/DVD.

They played their last shows on June 5, 2009, at the Ramshead in Annapolis, Maryland, and on June 6, 2009, at The Birchmere in Alexandria, Virginia. Navarro continues to tour as a solo performer. He is the cousin of guitarist Dave Navarro, who has played with Red Hot Chili Peppers and Jane's Addiction, among other groups. Keep The Light Alive: Celebrating The Music of Lowen & Navarro was released November 2009 with Lowen & Navarro songs performed by Jackson Browne, John Ondrasik of Five For Fighting, Keb' Mo', The Bangles, Severin Browne, Joel Rafael, Andy Chase, The Refugees, Freebo, Eddie From Ohio, Phil Parlapiano, Charlie Wadhams, and Stonehoney.

An EP entitled Middle of the Night was released in 2013, which was led by the single \"Every Time I Touch You\".

	dbo:abstract	"OutKast was an American hip hop duo formed in 1992, in East Point, Atlanta, Georgia, composed of Atlanta-based rappers Andr\u00E9 \"Andr\u00E9 3000\" Benjamin (formerly known as Dr\u00E9) and Antwan \"Big Boi\" Patton. Achieving both critical acclaim and commercial success in the mid-late 1990s and early 2000s, the duo helped popularize Southern hip hop styles while developing distinctive personas and an idiosyncratic sound that incorporated genres such as funk, psychedelia, techno, and gospel. Benjamin and Patton formed the group as high school students in 1992. OutKast released their debut album Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik in 1994, which gained popularity after the single \"Player's Ball\", reached number one on the Billboard Hot Rap Tracks chart. With successive releases including ATLiens (1996) and Aquemini (1998), the duo further developed their sound, experimenting with a variety of styles and achieving commercial success. In 2000, Outkast released the critically acclaimed Stankonia, which included the singles \"Ms. Jackson\" and \"B.O.B.\". In 2003, the duo released the double album Speakerboxxx/The Love Below, which featured the number one singles \"Hey Ya!\" and \"The Way You Move\" and would eventually win the Grammy Award for Album of the Year. Outkast next released the soundtrack for the 2006 musical film Idlewild, which they also starred in. In 2007, the duo went on hiatus and both members have since pursued solo careers. In 2014, Outkast reunited to celebrate their 20th anniversary by performing at more than 40 festivals worldwide in 2014, beginning at the Coachella Festival in April. The duo is one of the most successful hip-hop groups of all time, having received six Grammy Awards. Between six studio albums and a greatest hits release, Outkast has sold over 25 million records. Meanwhile, they have garnered widespread critical acclaim, with publications such as Rolling Stone and Pitchfork Media listing albums such as Aquemini and Stankonia among the best of their era."@en ;

Although all the members of the group are openly Christian, they have not been marketed in the Christian market since the band is on a secular label. The band toured across the United States, from their home state of California to the East Coast, in 2008. On October 4, 2010, Frontman Ross Kenyon announced that the band would be disbanding after their Japan tour. The band played their farewell show on November 7, 2010 in Pomona, CA. The band temporarily reformed in August 2012 to write and record their third full-length record titled \"All is Calm\" through Kickstarter. All is Calm was released on July 30, 2013 and a short tour was booked to promote the new record. Although Confide has stated they will not be reforming permanently, drummer Joel Piper said that there is possibility for them to play again in the future, but nothing permanent."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Much the Same is a punk rock band from the suburbs of Chicago, Illinois, United States. Their style is based on the fast, melodic skate punk of the mid-to-late 1990s made popular by bands such as NOFX, Lagwagon, and No Use for a Name. The band began in 1999 under the name Don't Look Down and changed to Much The Same in 2001 after a legal dispute with the now-defunct New Jersey band Don't Look Down. They released Quitters Never Win on A-F Records in 2003 and Survive in 2006. The band announced their break-up on April 23, 2007 following their first and only European tour. They reunited for a final farewell performance on March 26, 2011 at Reggie's Rock Club in Chicago. The sold out show featured both fan favorite songs and a few the band rarely, if ever, played live. The band announced on March 30, 2015 that they have reunited with former Break the Silence drummer, Mike Ford, on drums and will play shows around the Chicago area."@en ;

Two of their albums have peaked into the top 50 on the ARIA Albums Chart, Ocean Songs (1998) and Toward the Low Sun (2012). During their career they have spent much of their time overseas, when not performing together Turner is based in Melbourne, White lives in New York, and Ellis in Paris. Australian rock music historian Ian McFarlane described them as providing a \"rumbling, dynamic sound incorporated open-ended, improvisational, electric rock ... minus the jazz-rock histrionics\".

	dbo:abstract	"AC/DC are an Australian rock band, formed in 1973 by brothers Malcolm and Angus Young. A hard rock/blues rock band, they have also been considered a heavy metal band, although they have always dubbed their music simply \"rock and roll\". AC/DC underwent several line-up changes before releasing their first album, High Voltage, in 1975; Malcolm and Angus were the only original members left in the band. Membership subsequently stabilised until bassist Mark Evans was replaced by Cliff Williams in 1977 for the album Powerage. Within months of recording the album Highway to Hell, lead singer and co-songwriter Bon Scott died on 19 February 1980 after a night of heavy alcohol consumption. The group considered disbanding, but buoyed by support from Scott's parents, decided to continue and set about finding a new vocalist. Ex-Geordie singer Brian Johnson was auditioned and selected to replace Scott. Later that year, the band released the new album, Back in Black, which was made as a tribute to Bon Scott. The album launched them to new heights of success and became their all-time best-seller. The band's next album, For Those About to Rock We Salute You, was their first album to reach number one in the United States. Drummer Phil Rudd was fired in 1983 and replaced by ex-A II Z drummer Simon Wright, who left to join Dio in 1989. The band experienced a resurgence in the early 1990s with the release of The Razors Edge. Phil Rudd returned in 1994 after Chris Slade, who was with the band from 1989 to 1994, was asked to leave in favour of him, and contributed to the band's 1995 album Ballbreaker. Stiff Upper Lip, released in 2000, was well received by critics. The band's studio album, Black Ice, released in 2008, was the second-highest-selling album of that year, and their biggest chart hit since For Those About to Rock, eventually reaching No.1 on all charts worldwide. The band's line-up remained the same until 2014 with Malcolm Young's retirement and Rudd's legal troubles. In 2016, Johnson was advised to stop touring on account of worsening hearing loss and Guns N' Roses frontman Axl Rose stepped in as the band's vocalist for the remainder of that year's dates. Long-term bass player Cliff Williams subsequently indicated that he would retire from the band on the completion of their current world tour. AC/DC have sold more than 200 million records worldwide, including 71.5 million albums in the United States alone, adding them to the List of highest-certified music artists in the United States and the List of best-selling music artists. Back in Black has sold an estimated 50 million units worldwide, making it the fifth-highest-selling album by any artist \u2013 and the third-highest-selling album by any band. The album has sold 22 million units in the US alone, where it is the sixth-highest-selling album of all time. AC/DC ranked fourth on VH1's list of the \"100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock\" and were named the seventh \"Greatest Heavy Metal Band of All Time\" by MTV. In 2004, AC/DC ranked No. 72 on the Rolling Stone list of the \"100 Greatest Artists of All Time\". Producer Rick Rubin, who wrote an essay on the band for the Rolling Stone list, referred to AC/DC as \"the greatest rock and roll band of all time.\" In 2010, AC/DC were ranked number 23 in the VH1 list of the \"100 Greatest Artists of All Time\"."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Coldplay are a British rock band formed in 1996 by lead vocalist and pianist Chris Martin and lead guitarist Jonny Buckland at University College London (UCL). After they formed under the name Pectoralz, Guy Berryman joined the group as a bassist and they changed their name to Starfish. Will Champion joined as a drummer and backing vocalist, completing the performing line-up. Creative Director Phil Harvey is often referred to as the official fifth member by the band.

	dbo:abstract	"Fairport Convention are an English folk rock and electric folk band. Formed in 1967, they are widely regarded as a key group in the English folk rock movement. Their seminal album Liege & Lief is considered to have launched the electric folk or English folk rock movement, which provided a distinctively English identity to rock music and helped awaken much wider interest in traditional music in general. The large number of personnel who have been part of the band are among the most highly regarded and influential musicians of their era and have gone on to participate in a large number of significant bands, or enjoyed important solo careers. Since 1979, they have hosted the Cropredy Festival, which is the largest such annual event in England. Individually and collectively the members of Fairport Convention have received numerous awards recognising their contribution to music and culture. As of 2016, they continue to record and tour."@en ;
