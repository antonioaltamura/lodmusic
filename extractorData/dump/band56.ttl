	dbo:abstract	"Alice in Chains is an American rock band formed in Seattle, Washington, in 1987 by guitarist and songwriter Jerry Cantrell and original lead vocalist Layne Staley. The initial lineup was rounded out by drummer Sean Kinney and bassist Mike Starr, who was replaced in 1993 by Mike Inez. Although widely associated with grunge music, the band's sound incorporates heavy metal elements. Since its formation, Alice in Chains has released five studio albums, three EPs, two live albums, four compilations, and two DVDs. The band is known for its distinctive vocal style, which often included the harmonized vocals of Staley and Cantrell (and later William DuVall). Alice in Chains rose to international fame as part of the grunge movement of the early 1990s, along with other Seattle bands such as Nirvana, Pearl Jam, and Soundgarden. The band was one of the most successful music acts of the 1990s, selling over 20 million records worldwide, and over 14 million records in the US alone. In 1992 the band's second album, Dirt, was released to critical acclaim and was certified quadruple platinum. Their third album, Alice in Chains, was released in 1995 and has been certified double platinum. It achieved No. 1 position on the Billboard 200 chart. The band has had 14 top ten songs on the Mainstream Rock Tracks chart and nine Grammy Award nominations. Although never officially disbanding, Alice in Chains was plagued by extended inactivity from 1996 onwards due to Staley's substance abuse, which resulted in his death in 2002. The band reunited in 2005 for a live benefit show, performing with a number of guest vocalists. They toured in 2006, with William DuVall taking over as lead vocalist full-time. The new line-up released the band's fourth studio album, Black Gives Way to Blue, in 2009. The album received gold certification by the RIAA. In 2013, the band released The Devil Put Dinosaurs Here, its fifth studio album. The band has toured extensively and released several videos in support of these albums. Alice in Chains is currently working on their sixth studio album."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Buzzcocks are an English punk rock band, formed in Bolton, England in 1976 by singer-songwriter-guitarist Pete Shelley and singer-songwriter Howard Devoto. They are regarded as an important influence on the Manchester music scene, the independent record label movement, punk rock, power pop, and indie rock. They achieved commercial success with singles that fused pop craftsmanship with rapid-fire punk energy. These singles were collected on Singles Going Steady, described by critic Ned Raggett as a \"punk masterpiece\". Devoto and Shelley chose the name \"Buzzcocks\" after reading the headline, \"It's the Buzz, Cock!\", in a review of the TV series Rock Follies in Time Out magazine. The \"buzz\" is the excitement of playing on stage; \"cock\" is Manchester slang meaning \"mate\" (as in friend/buddy). They thought it captured the excitement of the Sex Pistols and nascent punk scene. Devoto left the band in 1977, after which Pete Shelley became the principal singer-songwriter."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Cream were a 1960s British rock supergroup power trio consisting of bassist/singer Jack Bruce, drummer Ginger Baker, and guitarist/singer Eric Clapton. The group's third album, Wheels of Fire (1968), was the world's first platinum-selling double album. The band is widely regarded as the world's first successful supergroup. In their career, they sold more than 15 million copies of their albums worldwide. Their music included songs based on traditional blues such as \"Crossroads\" and \"Spoonful\", and modern blues such as \"Born Under a Bad Sign\", as well as more eccentric songs such as \"Strange Brew\", \"Tales of Brave Ulysses\" and \"Toad\". The band's biggest hits are \"I Feel Free\" (UK, number 11), \"Sunshine of Your Love\" (US, number 5), \"White Room\" (US, number 6), \"Crossroads\" (US, number 28), and \"Badge\" (UK, number 18). The band made a significant impact on the popular music of the time, and, along with Jimi Hendrix and other notable guitarists and bands, popularised the use of the wah-wah pedal. They provided a heavy yet technically proficient musical theme that foreshadowed and influenced the emergence of British bands such as Led Zeppelin, The Jeff Beck Group, Deep Purple and Black Sabbath in the late 1960s and the early 1970s. The band's live performances influenced progressive rock acts such as Rush. The band was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1993. They were included in both Rolling Stone and VH1's lists of the \"100 Greatest Artists of All Time,\" at number 67 and 61 respectively. They were also ranked number 16 on VH1's \"100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock\"."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Deep Purple are an English rock band formed in Hertford in 1968. They are considered to be among the pioneers of heavy metal and modern hard rock, although their musical approach changed over the years. Originally formed as a progressive rock band, the band shifted to a heavier sound in 1970. Deep Purple, together with Led Zeppelin and Black Sabbath, have been referred to as the \"unholy trinity of British hard rock and heavy metal in the early to mid-seventies\". They were listed in the 1975 Guinness Book of World Records as \"the globe's loudest band\" for a 1972 concert at London's Rainbow Theatre, and have sold over 100 million albums worldwide. Deep Purple have had several line-up changes and an eight-year hiatus (1976\u20131984). The 1968\u20131976 line-ups are commonly labelled Mark I, II, III and IV. Their second and most commercially successful line-up featured Ian Gillan (vocals), Jon Lord (organ), Roger Glover (bass), Ian Paice (drums), and Ritchie Blackmore (guitar). This line-up was active from 1969 to 1973, and was revived from 1984 to 1989, and again from 1992 to 1993. The band achieved more modest success in the intervening periods between 1968 and 1969 with the line-up including Rod Evans (vocals) and Nick Simper (bass, backing vocals), between 1974 and 1976 (Tommy Bolin replacing Blackmore in 1975) with the line-up including David Coverdale (vocals) and Glenn Hughes (bass, vocals), and between 1989 and 1992 with the line-up including Joe Lynn Turner (vocals). The band's line-up (currently featuring Ian Gillan, and guitarist Steve Morse from 1994) has been much more stable in recent years, although organist Jon Lord's retirement from the band in 2002 (being succeeded by Don Airey) left Ian Paice as the only original Deep Purple member still in the band. Deep Purple were ranked number 22 on VH1's Greatest Artists of Hard Rock programme and a poll on British radio station Planet Rock ranked them 5th among the \"most influential bands ever\". The band received the Legend Award at the 2008 World Music Awards. Having been nominated for the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2012 and 2013 but failing to get enough votes for induction, Deep Purple were finally announced as inductees into the Hall of Fame in December 2015. They were officially inducted on 8 April 2016."@en ;

Crystal Castles are known for their chaotic live shows and lo-fi melancholic homemade productions.

In 2005 Ethan Kath released the digital singles \"Magic Spells\" and \"Untrust Us\" under the moniker Crystal Castles. As they grew popular online he began receiving offers from record labels. In 2006 Kath recruited vocalist Alice Glass for the band's first physical four-track EP \"Alice Practice\" which was released on vinyl. Their debut album, Crystal Castles, was released in 2008 and was listed on NME's \"Top 100 Greatest Albums of the Decade\" list at No. 39.

Their first official concert according to the band was on February 14, 1990. Their first album, La Invasi\u00F3n de los Bl\u00E1tidos, set them apart from any other Mexican rock band, since the album contained irreverent, humorous, curse-word laden lyrics and aggressive sound, that at the time were not expected in Mexican music. \"Cuca\" is an apocope for cucaracha (cockroach) and \"bl\u00E1tidos\" means blattodea, which is the scientific name given to cockroachs. In 1999, the band split for unspecified reasons. In March 2004, they reunited for a series of concerts in La Concha Ac\u00FAstica del Parque Agua Azul of Guadalajara which were edited into a new DVD titled VIVA CUCA."@en ;

Bocek and Zurick were both members of Joan of Arc at the time, but quit when the four formed Ghosts and Vodka (Zurick would return to Joan of Arc several years later). Ghosts and Vodka continued to play until 2001 when Villareal and Zurick opted to concentrate on Owls, which saw them reuniting with their ex-Cap'n Jazz bandmates Mike and Tim Kinsella. In 2003, the Sixgunlover label compiled the group's full anthology onto one CD. In March 2009, the band put a blog up on their Myspace with news of their first practice in 8 years, but later that year announced that they were not continuing in the near future."@en ;

The name was chosen in homage to his home state of South Dakota and also as a parody of Kid Rock. In the summer of 1999, Darren recorded the five songs that would appear on the So Pretty ep with long-time friend and producer, Alex Oana, at City Cabin (formerly Blackberry Way). Darren moved to Minneapolis, Minnesota that winter and self-released the So Pretty ep in the spring of 2000. The ep caught the attention of Alan Sparhawk, singer and guitarist for the seminal slow-core band, Low (band) and he offered to release the ep on his label, Chairkickers' Union under the condition that it be expanded into a full-length lp. The LP version of \"So Pretty\" was released in the spring of 2002 with three additional songs. In 2004 his second album, \"The West is the Future\" was also released by Chairkickers. It was recorded live at Seedy Underbelly in Minneapolis, MN by Alex Oana and featured Zak Sally, the bassist from Low. A Winner's Shadow, was released on March 11, 2008 on Graveface Records. His new album, \"'Listen to the Crows as They Take Flight\" was released by Graveface in October 2011."@en ;

dbr:Mexican_Pets	rdf:type	dbo:Band ;
	foaf:name	"Mexican Pets"@en ;
	dbo:abstract	"Mexican Pets were formed by Pat Clafferty and Jill Hahn in Dublin, Ireland in 1990 inspired by American bands such as H\u00FCsker D\u00FC and Dinosaur Jr. The two soon drafted Derrick Dalton in on bass whose distinct and accomplished style was an invaluable contribution to the band's sound. The band never featured a permanent drummer and a string of players graced the stool including two guys called Eric, both of them American. Having made several demo recordings and playing extensive gigs around the country, they had their first break up. Each of its members pursued other musical interests until the spring of 1994 when they reformed. In that same year they found a permanent drummer in Fionan O Leary. Jill Hahn then moved to Manchester, replaced by Brian Gough on other guitar and organ. They recorded their first album Nobody's Working Title on Independent Records that summer and continued to play across the country. It was then that Andy Cairns from northern rockers Therapy? released four singles on his label Blunt. Two of these singles featured the songs off the band's first record and 6 brand new songs were quickly penned for the final two. This was also released on CD format under the title \"The Voice of Trucker Youth\". Every one of the four singles was each awarded 'single of the week' by Hot Press. One bizarre event was when they played Whelans in Dublin's city centre. Having seen a poster for the band, the Mexican Ambassador turned up at the gig with his driver and bodyguard curious to see who the Mexican act were. The ambassador watched the gig and came backstage and thanked the band for their performance. So enthralled by the band that he invited them out to the embassy on his retirement where they performed an a cappella version of 'A Gringo like Me', for the ambassador and crowd including the Papal Nuncio to Ireland. In 1995, Derrick Dalton left and was replaced by John Duff. The band began to play their first gigs in London, frequenting the infamous venues in Camden town and it was not long before they came to the attention of the legendary Seymour Stein who came to see them play with The Poster Children and Steelpole Bathtub in London. 1996 saw The Pets tour in Germany and the Netherlands and several return visits to London. In August of that year they recorded their final album Humbucker which featured a tougher guitar driven sound. The record was again funded by Cairns who had become an invaluable patron of the band. Having promoted the record with a series of gigs and a brief tour of England the band called it a day in May 1997 for reasons unknown. In 2006, following discussions between Clafferty, O Leary and Gough, the band was kick started once more. The late Derrick Dalton, who was playing in the band Crumb, was asked if he would pick up his Bass once more. Thankfully he agreed. Derrick was taken from us too early and we extend our sympathies to his family and many friends. The band wish to publicly thank Dave O'Grady for his tireless and challenging work in managing the band. We also wish to say thank you to Dan Oggly and Andy Cairns. Pat Clafferty went on to record an album in his home studio called \"A Prayer to St. Jude\" Original founder Pat continues to write songs and having located to Donegal, he will release a brand new record with all new material, under the Mexican Pets moniker once more."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Killdozer was an American noise rock band, formed in Madison, Wisconsin in 1983, with members Bill Hobson, Dan Hobson and Michael Gerald. They took their name from the 1974 TV movie, directed by Jerry London, itself based on a Theodore Sturgeon short story. They released their first album, Intellectuals are the Shoeshine Boys of the Ruling Elite, in the same year. The band split in 1990 but reformed in 1993, losing guitarist Bill Hobson and gaining Paul Zagoras, and continued until they split up in 1996. Their farewell tour was officially titled \"Fuck You, We Quit!\", and included Erik Tunison of Die Kreuzen in place of Dan Hobson on drums and Jeff Ditzenberger on additional guitar. The band released nine albums, including a post-breakup live CD, The Last Waltz. Killdozer was notable for its slow, grinding song structures and blackly humorous lyrics, growled ominously by singer/guitarist Michael Gerald at the top of his lungs. Many of their songs were disturbing narratives of small-town life gone awry, and later had a jaded, left wing political perspective. Killdozer is regarded by many to have helped set the foundation for grunge music, despite that genre's association with the city of Seattle. The band also became famous for its cover songs, an example being Don McLean's \"American Pie\". A version exists on their 1989 all-covers album For Ladies Only. Gerald also did a cover of Jessi Colter's \"I'm Not Lisa\" for the band's 1986 EP Burl, dedicated \"in loving memory of\" the still-living-at-the-time Burl Ives. The EP in its entirety can be found on the CD version of their 1994 album Uncompromising War on Art Under the Dictatorship of the Proletariat."@en ;

Upon their development, Dance Gavin Dance released their debut EP, Whatever I Say Is Royal Ocean in 2006 and signed to Rise Records thereafter. The band released their full-length debut studio album, Downtown Battle Mountain, in May 2007, which spawned the singles \"And I Told Them I Invented Times New Roman\" and \"Lemon Meringue Tie\". Throughout 2008, the band's vocalist Jonny Craig and guitarist Sean O'Sullivan left the band and were replaced by vocalist Kurt Travis (also from A Lot Like Birds) and guitarist Zac Garren. The band released their second full-length album, Dance Gavin Dance, in August. The album peaked at No. 172 on the U.S. Billboard 200 chart and No. 26 on the Top Independent Albums chart. Vocalist Jon Mess and bass guitarist Eric Lodge left the band before the album's release. Bassist Jason Ellis replaced Lodge. Happiness was released as the band's third studio album in June 2009, peaking at No. 145 on the Billboard 200 Albums chart and No. 30 on the Top Independent Albums chart and is the group's first release in which guitarist Will Swan pursued screaming vocals along with guitar parts for an album.

	dbo:abstract	"Diante do Trono (IPA: [dj\u0250\u0303.t\u0268 du t\u027Eonu]; lit.: Before the Throne) is a Brazilian contemporary Christian music band formed in 1997 in the city of Belo Horizonte, in the Lagoinha Baptist Church. It is led by singer, songwriter and pastor Ana Paula Valad\u00E3o. The group became popular in Brazil after the release of their first work, the disc Diante do Trono 1998. However, it was the albums \u00C1guas Purificadoras and Preciso de Ti that gained them international recognition, turning them into the main worship ministry in Latin America and one of the most successful in Brazilian music. In one presentation, held in 2003 during the recording of the album Quero Me Apaixonar, Diante do Trono gathered about 2 million people. The band has won trophies for Talent and Promise, and was also nominated for a Latin Grammy in 2012 with the Sol da Justi\u00E7a work. Diante do Trono has sold over 15 million records in various formats, one of the record holders of record sales in Brazil. The band, from its inception had a brass orchestra and strings, has had several instrumental changes throughout its career, especially the period of the years 2008 and 2010, when the only members that remained from the initial training group were Ana Paula Valad\u00E3o, vocalist and band leader, and Elias Fernandes, rhythm guitarist of the set. With the end of the orchestra the band's sound became noticeably more pop rock. The band's music is characterized by congregational singing and contemporary Christian music, with influences of pop rock, progressive rock and folk. The band had also created the Center for Ministerial Training Diante do Trono (CTMDT), a preparatory center for musicians and singers in the area of missions, as well as the Arts Factory, which in a partnership with the Lagoinha Baptist Church trains professionals in diverse areas such as singing, theater and dance, and has part of his discography devoted entirely to children. Diante do Trono participates in social projects, such as India Project, which collects and help Indian girls in prostitution, food donations to cities in the North of Minas Gerais in 2003, and a campaign of bone marrow donations in Barretos, during the recording of their thirteenth album in 2010."@en ;

In the mid-1990s Ninety Pound Wuss established itself as part of the Christian punk scene with their self-titled debut. The release of their second album, Where Meager Die Of Self Interest (1997) saw the band's sound take a dramatic shift, becoming much darker and more dynamically complex. Ninety Pound Wuss continued this development further on their post-punk swan song, Short Hand Operation (1999), by not only displaying an increased use of guitar effects and synthesizers, but also by showcasing some of the strongest songwriting of their career. However, the juxtaposition of being a punk band associated with the Christian music industry proved too exhausting and would ultimately lead to their disbandment in 2000."@en ;

Initially, the music of Poupp\u00E9e Fabrikk (PF) borrowed heavily from minimalistic electronic acts such as Deutsch Amerikanische Freundschaft and Nitzer Ebb, but with the addition of Jouni Olilla and Jonas Aneheim on guitar PF moved towards a more Die Krupps-style electronic/metal mix. The \"Your Pain - Our Gain\" CD was meant to be released in 1996, but due to differences in opinion between the band and the record company (Energy Rekords) it was delayed until 1999. In 1996 the band decided to take a break and PF was put on hold and the band members worked on various solo projects. In 2000 the band re-united for a gig at the Tinitus Electronic Festival and announced that they were making a comeback and returning to their roots. They released a four track mini CD entitled \"Elite Electronics\". A year later though, both Jouni and Henrik left the band to concentrate on their respective solo careers. PF disbanded shortly afterwards. After seven years of absence from the scene the band re-united in 2009, Christian R filling the place of former member Jouni Ollila. In October 2010, they once again re-united for a gig; this time at Bodyfest on Fryshuset."@en ;

Each of them has a younger sister who was unable to pronounce her brother's name when very young; \"Geggy\" and \"Tah\" were the baby girls' mispronunciations of their brothers' names. Their first release, Grand Opening, appeared in 1994 on David Byrne's label Luaka Bop. For their 1996 release Sacred Cow, they added drummer Daren Hahn to the lineup. Also on Luaka Bop, the album spawned the hit single \"Whoever You Are\" which peaked at #16 on the Billboard Modern Rock Tracks chart (the song would also appear in a Mercedes-Benz commercial circa 2001). Gina is the name of the last track and the name of the dog on the covers of both Grand Opening and Sacred Cow. Gina's owner was Susan Rogers, the producer of Grand Opening and Sacred Cow whose credits also include Prince, The Jacksons, David Byrne, Barenaked Ladies and Edie Brickell. In 1999, the band announced a new album entitled Music Inspired by the Fragrance, and released two songs (\"Space Heater\" and \"Sweat\") on the web in mp3 format. However, in part because of Luaka Bop's move from Warner Bros. to Virgin Records, the album went unreleased until 2001, by which point it had acquired a new title: Into the Oh. Into the Oh was released on Luaka Bop / Virgin with new band members including Los Angeles session percussionist and composer \"Lavey\" Bruce Millstein. In 2006, Kurstin formed a new band, The Bird and the Bee. In 2010, Kurstin was nominated for a Grammy Award in the Best Producer, Non-Classical division for his work on Lily Allen's It's Not Me, It's You."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"During the tour supporting their second studio effort, Di'Anno was fired from the band after drug and alcohol abuse affected his live performance. Vocalist Bruce Dickinson left his previous band, Samson, to audition for Iron Maiden in September 1981 and joined shortly afterwards. After the release of their third album, The Number of the Beast, drummer Nicko McBrain replaced Burr, who left due to personal and scheduling problems on the subsequent Beast on the Road tour. This is considered by many as their quintessential lineup, with which they released a series of high-impact works. In 1990, prior to the recording of their eighth studio album, Smith was asked to leave the band due to a lack of enthusiasm, brought about by the \"stripped-down\" musical direction they were taking, which Smith considered \"a step backwards\". Janick Gers, an old friend of Dickinson's who performed on his debut solo album, became the new guitarist. This formation recorded one more album before Dickinson departed in 1993, in order to pursue his solo career further. The band listened to hundreds of tapes submitted by vocalists before asking Blaze Bayley to audition, with whom they would go on to release two studio albums, after which Bayley left the band by mutual consent in January 1999. At that point, the band were in talks with Dickinson, who, after a meeting with Steve Harris and Rod Smallwood (the group's manager) in Brighton, agreed to rejoin along with Adrian Smith, who was telephoned a few hours later. Iron Maiden thus became a six-piece band and have gone on to make five further studio releases. The current lineup is now the longest and most stable in the band's history."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"(See also: Mahlathini and the Mahotella Queens) The Mahotella Queens is a South African female group formed in 1964 by music producer Rupert Bopape. Originally a studio recording group consisting of around five or six singers, the current line-up of the Queens comprises Hilda Tloubatla, Nobesuthu Mbadu and Amanda Nkosi. The group is noted for their distinct vocal harmony sound, guitar-led mbaqanga music and fast-paced stage dancing. Bopape was a talent scout and producer at the independent Gallo Africa's then-subsidiary dedicated to black music, Mavuthela Music Company. He formed the Mahotella Queens as the company's resident girl group and the ensemble, often led by the deep-voiced male vocals of Simon 'Mahlathini' Nkabinde, went on to have many hit records during the 1960s. The Queens line-up during this period usually comprised Hilda Tloubatla, Juliet Mazamisa, Ethel Mngomezulu, Nobesuthu Mbadu and Mildred Mangxola. The Queens and Mahlathini were backed by Mavuthela's house band, the Makgona Tsohle Band (comprising several talented instrumentalists including Marks Mankwane on lead guitar and West Nkosi on alto saxophone). In 1972 the line-up of the Mahotella Queens disintegrated after royalty disagreements with Bopape; Mahlathini left the company in a similar dispute with the producer. However, with a change of membership, the Queens remained productive and popular into the 1970s and 1980s. In 1987, following the explosion of interest in South African music, the Queens line-up was rejigged and three of its original singers \u2013 Hilda Tloubatla, Nobesuthu Mbadu and Mildred Mangxola \u2013 returned to the group. In combination with Mahlathini, the group forged a successful international touring career that lasts to this day. In spite of the deaths of Mahlathini, Marks Mankwane and West Nkosi during the late 1990s, the Mahotella Queens continue to perform and record in the 21st century. In 2013, long-serving member Mildred Mangxola retired from the group. She was replaced by a new recruit, Amanda Nkosi."@en ;

The band made their live-debut at the Scorched Tundra Festival in Gothenburg, December 2012. In 2014 Nonexist started recording album number three entitled Throne of Scars. It features nine tracks and is produced and mixed by Johan Reinholdz at Multipass Studios with the assistance of Markus Nilsson at Sunnan\u00E5 Studio in Malm\u00F6. The style of the songs retain the atmosphere from the previous album; dark, intense, varied and heavy while also adding some new influences in the mix. \"Throne of Scars\" was mixed and ready in April 2015 and during the same time the band signed a deal with Danish label Mighty Music. The album was released in Japan by Trooper Entertainment, in August and in the rest of the world by Mighty Music on October 10, 2015. In November 2015 Johan Liiva quit the band and Reinholdz took over the frontman-duties doing both guitar and vocals in the studio and also live - where the band now is active with Faithful Darkness-members Johan Aldg\u00E5rd and Joakim Strandberg Nilsson as well as Andromeda-bassplayer Linus Abrhamson completing the line-up. Nonexist is currently working on an EP called \"The New Flesh\" which will feature songs from \"Throne of Scars\" as well as tracks from previous albums with Reinholdz' vocals."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Early Man is a heavy metal band from Brooklyn, New York, now based in Los Angeles, California. Guitarist and vocalist Mike Conte began performing under the name \"Early Man\" in the early 2000s, and when drummer Adam Bennati moved to New York in 2003, the two formed the nucleus for the current line-up. Drawing influence from bands such as Black Sabbath, Mercyful Fate, Megadeth, Judas Priest, Kreator, Celtic Frost, and early Metallica, their traditional approach quickly gained the attention of the independent music scene and they released their first EP in early 2005 on Monitor Records. Matador Records quickly signed them and released their debut LP, \"Closing In\", in the fall of the same year. Lead guitarist Pete Macy was added to the band's lineup in 2005. The band has used several bass players over the years and at times will perform without one. The band cut ties with Matador Records and signed with The End Records in 2008. They released \"Beware The Circling Fin\", a 4-song EP on October 14, 2008, and tours with Iced Earth, High On Fire, 3 Inches Of Blood, Toxic Holocaust, Skeletonwitch, and Valient Thorr soon followed. The follow-up to the group's debut album is entitled \"Death Potion\". It was recorded and produced by Jack Endino. \"Death Potion\" was released on July 20, 2010, and the band did a fall tour with Evile and Bonded by Blood. Prior to the tour Mike Conte announced that he had officially cut ties with Adam Bennati. The band is currently using various touring drummers for live shows. In July 2011 it was announced that Mike Conte is the Composer for a new show debuting on the Cartoon Network called Secret Mountain Fort Awesome. Conte is in charge of all of the music for the show which premiered in the fall of 2011."@en ;

The band has released fifteen studio albums and completed numerous international tours. The band was founded after the demise of Cave and Harvey's former group the Birthday Party, the members of which met at a boarding school in Victoria, Australia. Deviating from the noise rock roots of their contemporaries, Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds have produced alternative rock that has been influenced by various genres, such as punk rock, gothic rock, no wave and blues. Their early material\u2014From Her to Eternity (1984), The Firstborn Is Dead (1985), Your Funeral... My Trial (1986) and Tender Prey (1988)\u2014primarily featured a post-punk sound. The band has progressively incorporated other songwriting elements; for example, the 2008 release Dig, Lazarus, Dig!!! experimented with garage rock, also an influence of the side project Grinderman. Synthesizers and minimal guitar work feature prominently on Push the Sky Away (2013), recorded after the departure of Harvey in 2009."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Northstar was an American band formed in 1997 in Huntsville, Alabama. Since the band's inception, they have had around five guitarists and three different bassists, have been a three-piece, four-piece, and a five-piece. Due to a lack of a dedicated music scene in the Huntsville area, the band decided to start touring the country in 2000. They booked their first tour, bought a van, and set out on the road. Since then, they have been on several U.S. and Canadian tours with bands including Taking Back Sunday, Say Anything, Lucero, Hot Rod Circuit, Piebald, Moneen and The Jealous Sound. While touring to promote Pollyanna the band also made a brief visit to the U.K. with Modest Mouse. After two years of booking, promoting, and producing everything themselves, the band signed a deal with Triple Crown Records of New York City in June 2002. With all the band's numerous changes to the setup of band members over the years, the final and most common line-up was Nick Torres on lead vocals and guitar, Tyler Odom on guitar, Jake Fisher on bass and backing vocals, and Gabe Renfroe on Drums. This was the line-up on their last album Pollyanna, although Shawn Regan did replace Jake Fisher right before their signing to Triple Crown Records. Shawn took over bass duties on recording the band's debut Is This Thing Loaded? and toured for over a year in support of the album until Jake's return to the band. Northstar broke up in April 2005. Nick Torres and Tyler Odom created Cassino. The demos for Cassino were recorded with Matt Squire and used drummer Will Noon, of Straylight Run fame. A collection of B-sides and alternate recordings, entitled Broken Parachute, has been announced by Nashville-based Speak Music Media. The original release date was summer 2006, but this date has been pushed back frequently. The five track EP has been expanded to a nine track full-length upon the discovery of an old Northstar demo. It was released on January 8, 2008."@en ;

Formed in 1986, they are best known for their 1989 single \"Living in Oblivion\". The band is one of the primary bands which carried electronic music's transition from the late 1980s into the 1990s and beyond. With a current lineup consisting of Claude Strilio, Dania Morales and Paul Rijnders, the past members have included Carlos Pacheco, Mike Zacek, Gary Strilio, Dave South and Barry Bunch. The band is noted for its melodic, synth-driven dance beats from its early years as well as its fusion of electronics and guitars which is its current musical focus. The band's songs, lyrics, as well as Claude's vocals have been widely regarded in the electronic music community as some of the finest. The band also receives praise for its album artwork which ranges from oil paintings to electronic paintings which are all works of Claude Strilio. Anything Box, (also known as Abox by its loyal fan-base), has released several albums, EPs and singles and continues to perform their energetic live shows around the world. The band's name comes from the title of a book of short stories by Zenna Henderson, The Anything Box. In the title story, a young girl imagines the world as she would have it, apparently by staring at an empty space between her hands. Her school teacher discovers that the box is invisible, but real. Anything Box's most recent release is The Future Past EP (Endpop, June 2007) which features a remake and remixes of their 1990 fan-favorite \"Carmen\" as well as a Spanish version of the song. This marks the first time Anything Box has released a song in Spanish, which has often been requested by their fans."@en ;

After serving as a backing band for outlaw country acts David Allan Coe and Johnny Paycheck, the band signed to a recording contract with Atlantic Records, releasing their self-titled debut album that year. Throughout the 1990s, they released four more albums for Atlantic. Confederate Railroad has released six studio albums. In addition, more than twenty of their singles have entered the Billboard Hot Country Songs charts. Only two changes in membership have occurred, both in the late 1990s-early 2000s: Michael Lamb was replaced by Jimmy Dormire on lead guitar, and Cody McCarver took over for Chris McDaniel, the band's original keyboardist. In addition to his work with Confederate Railroad, McCarver has released one solo album and two singles. Dormire was replaced in 2008 by Rusty Hendrix. The band's most recent studio album, Lucky To Be Alive, was issued on the D&B Masterworks label on July 15, 2016.

Their musical style, difficult to categorize, owes more to freeform jazz, psychedelic rock, and experimental avant-garde music than to traditional folk music, and may be loosely attributed to such genres as free folk, psychedelic folk, freak folk or New Weird America. The Davenport Family name existed actively until 2005. Presently, all original members participate in a similar band, which operates under the name Second Family Band. The recordings and performances typically include varying combinations of drums and other percussion, guitars, vocals, synthesizers, piano, organs, violins, flutes, electronics, sound sculpture, field recordings, more synths, sitar, sticks, rocks, and stones. Their music is almost always improvised, with a rare exception of overdubbing and other studio composed manipulations, especially in the early days of the group. The group is noted for usually shunning the recording studio, preferring field recording in locations such as barns, caves, or pastures. Consequently, environmental sounds such as dogs barking, birds singing, and other ambient noise may be heard on record."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Goldblade are an English punk rock band from Manchester, England. The band formed in early 1995 when ex Membranes frontman, John Robb, put the band together with Wayne Simmons and former Membranes and A Witness vocalist Keith Curtis on bass, Rob Haynes (ex Houndgod and Killing for Pleasure/K.F.P.) on drums and Jay Taylor on guitar. The band signed to Ultimate Records and released their first single, \"Soul Power\", before releasing several more singles and two albums - Home Turf (1996/97), and Goldblade Drop the Bomb (1998) before Simmons departed. In 2000, Goldblade then recruited a new percussionist, Martin Gray, into the line up and recorded two further singles \"AC/DC\" and \"Who Was The Killa?\" together with a third album Do You Believe In The Power Of Rock 'n' Roll all released in 2002 on a new label, Twenty Stone Blatt. In 2001, Jay Taylor left the band to concentrate on his Bonebox project, and two new members Johny Skullknuckles and Pete 'Gorgeous' Byrchmore (ex-Nightingales, and U.K Subs) were recruited to begin work on the next album, Rebel Songs (2004). Second percussionist Gray left shortly after the recording sessions, and the album was released in 2005 on the Captain Oi! label. The band continued gigging and recording as a five-piece, with the next album Mutiny (also on Captain Oi! Records) released in 2008. Both \"Rebel Songs\" and \"Mutiny\" were also issued internationally. Goldblade continue to tour extensively. They regularly appear at major UK music festivals, including Glastonbury Festival, Reading Festival, Wickerman Festival and Rebellion Festival, and several smaller ones (Strummercamp). They have played in St Petersburg to 25,000 people, in Serbia and, in early 2010, in Algiers (being one of only a handful of Western bands to do so). In March 2010, Skullknuckles departed to be replaced by another guitarist Andy Taylor (not the one from Duran Duran). Goldblade issued a compilation album, Beyond God & Elvis in China (on Kids-Union Records) in September 2010, following it with dates in Beijing. On 20 May 2013 Goldblade released the album The Terror Of Modern Life on Overground Records in CD, Vinyl and download formats."@en ;

Although it was not the first Soviet band to play heavy music, Aria was the first to break through to mainstream media and commercial success. According to several public polls, Aria ranks among top 10 most popular Russian rock bands. Their sound resembled that of NWOBHM bands, for which they were dubbed the \"Russian Iron Maiden\" in the media. Most of Aria's lyrics have been written not by the band's members but by professional poets Margarita Pushkina and Alexander Yelin. Aria is the root of so-called \"Aria Family\": several bands formed by its former members. In 1987, four ex-members of Aria formed the band Master, who are still considered, along with Aria, one of the most influential Russian metal bands. Vocalist Valery Kipelov, who was the main voice of the band for the majority of albums they have released, departed in 2002 and formed his own heavy-metal band Kipelov. Till Lindemann & Richard Kruspe of Rammstein have covered an Aria song, \"Shtil\" (\u0428\u0442\u0438\u043B\u044C).

Up to 2009, Big Big Train worked mostly as a studio project band headed by Spawton and Poole with changing line-ups and guest musicians. Since their sixth album The Underfall Yard, which received critical acclaim from the progressive rock community, a more stable lineup has been established, and the band performed their first live concerts in seventeen years at Kings Place, London, in August 2015. The gigs were voted Event Of The Year by the readers of Prog magazine. Stone & Steel, a Blu-ray featuring the 2014 rehearsals at Real World Studios and four of the songs performed at Kings Place, was released on 21 March 2016. Big Big Train were the winners of the Breakthrough Award at the Progressive Music Awards held at Kew Gardens, London on 3 September 2013, and have been nominated in several other categories in recent years.

Their music had a profound impact on bluegrass, country, Southern Gospel, pop and rock musicians as well as on the U.S. folk revival of the 1960s. They were the first vocal group to become country music stars. Their recordings of songs such as \"Wabash Cannonball\", \"Can the Circle Be Unbroken\", \"Wildwood Flower\", \"Keep On the Sunny Side\" and \"I'm Thinking Tonight of My Blue Eyes\" made these songs country standards. The latter's tune was used for Roy Acuff's \"The Great Speckled Bird\", Hank Thompson's \"The Wild Side of Life\" and Kitty Wells' \"It Wasn't God Who Made Honky Tonk Angels\", making the song a hit all over again in other incarnations. The original group consisted of Alvin Pleasant \"A.P.\" Delaney Carter (1891\u20131960), his wife Sara Dougherty Carter (1898\u20131979), and his sister-in-law Maybelle Addington Carter (1909\u20131978). Maybelle was married to A.P.'s brother Ezra (Eck) Carter, and was also Sara's first cousin. All three were born and raised in southwestern Virginia, where they were immersed in the tight harmonies of mountain gospel music and shape note singing. Throughout the group's career, Sara Carter sang lead vocals; Maybelle sang harmony and accompanied the group instrumentally; on some songs A.P. did not perform at all but at times sang harmony and background vocals and, once in a while, lead vocal. Maybelle's distinctive guitar playing style became a hallmark of the group."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Death Cab for Cutie is an American alternative rock band, formed in Bellingham, Washington in 1997. The band comprises Ben Gibbard (vocals, guitar, piano), Nick Harmer (bass), Dave Depper (guitar, keyboards, vocals), Zac Rae (keyboards, guitar), and Jason McGerr (drums). In 2014, founding guitarist and producer Chris Walla announced that he would be departing from the band after recording their eighth studio album, Kintsugi. The band was originally a solo project by Ben Gibbard, when he released the demo album You Can Play These Songs with Chords to positive reception. This led to a record deal with Barsuk Records. Gibbard decided to expand the project into a complete band, releasing their debut album Something About Airplanes in 1998, and their second album, We Have the Facts and We're Voting Yes, in 2000; both records were positively received in the indie community. Their third album, 2001's The Photo Album, gave the band their first charting single, and the release of the group's fourth album Transatlanticism, in 2003, gained the band mainstream critical and commercial success. After signing with Atlantic Records, Death Cab For Cutie released their fifth album and major-label debut Plans in 2005, which received platinum certification from the Recording Industry Association of America. The band released their sixth album Narrow Stairs in 2008, which served as a stylistic departure for the group. Their seventh album, 2011's Codes and Keys, featured the band's first number one single, \"You Are a Tourist\". Their eighth studio album Kintsugi, the last to feature Walla, was released on March 31, 2015. Death Cab for Cutie's music has been labeled as indie rock, indie pop, and alternative rock. It is noted for its use of unconventional instrumentation, as well as Gibbard's distinctive voice and unique lyrical style. Since their formation, the band has released eight full-length studio albums, four EPs, two live EPs, one live album, and one demo album."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"The Dixie Chicks are an American country music band which has also crossed over into other genres, including pop and alternative country. The band is composed of founding members (and sisters) Martie Erwin Maguire and Emily Erwin Robison, and lead singer Natalie Maines. The band formed in 1989 in Dallas, Texas, and was originally composed of four women performing bluegrass and country music, busking and touring the bluegrass festival circuits and small venues for six years without attracting a major label. After the departure of one bandmate, the replacement of their lead singer, and a slight change in their repertoire, Dixie Chicks soon achieved commercial success, beginning in 1998 with hit songs \"There's Your Trouble\" and \"Wide Open Spaces\". On March 10, 2003, during a London concert, nine days before the March 19, 2003 invasion of Iraq, lead vocalist Maines told the audience: \"We don't want this war, this violence, and we're ashamed that the President of the United States (George W. Bush) is from Texas\". The positive reaction to this statement from the British audience contrasted with the negative reaction including boycotts that ensued in the US, where the band was denounced by talk-show conservatives, while their albums were discarded in public protest. As of 2015, Dixie Chicks have won 13 Grammy Awards, including five in 2007 for Taking the Long Way\u2014which received the Grammy Award for Album of the Year\u2014and \"Not Ready to Make Nice\", a single from that album. By December 2015, with 30.5 million certified albums sold, and sales of 27.5 million albums in the U.S. alone, they had become the top selling all-female band and biggest-selling country group in the U.S. during the Nielsen SoundScan era (1991\u2013present)."@en ;

In October 2007, Nilsen moved from Vancouver to Toronto. She resided there settling in Parkdale writing the songs that were to become \"Nuclearize Me\", which Now Magazine described as \"Reminiscent of Belle & Sebastian\u2019s fuller late-period material, it\u2019s steady and sure, intimate and honest, with songs that are so damn smartly crafted.\", recorded with Dave Draves at Little Bullhorn Studios in Ottawa.

	dbo:abstract	"ArnoCorps is a rock music group based in San Francisco, CA. The band combines a militaristic appearance with a musical style rooted in skate punk and heavy metal. Describing their music as Action Adventure Hardcore Rock and Roll, the focus of the band is on energetic live performances which feature interaction with the audience. Attendees and fans are referred to by the band as \"Goddamn Heroes and Sheroes.\" ArnoCorps is the world's first band to feature lyrics based exclusively on the films of Arnold Schwarzenegger, with particular emphasis on his action roles from the 1980s such as The Terminator, Predator and Total Recall, with many of the lyrics paralleling movie dialogue and plots, similar to The Misfits' lyrical focus on horror films and B-movies. As a further part of their concept, ArnoCorps claim to be inspired by ancient folklore and mythology originating from the alps of their \"native\" Austria, suggesting that there are actually sociological and philosophical topics being addressed in their lyrics. ArnoCorps went further to charge several Hollywood movie studios with \"stealing\" the lore and mythology of Austria for plot material and dialogue in the films they have parodied. In 2004 the band attempted to launch a class-action lawsuit against the studios on behalf of the Austrian people, although the case failed to go to court. The band's stage show sees all six members dressed in combat fatigues and camouflage paint (most likely inspired by Predator and Commando) and address the audience in \"ballsy\" accents. Each band member uses a pseudonym and have heroic backstories. ArnoCorps often performs with two bass players in their line-up (an arrangement they refer to as \"heroic symmetry\"). After releasing two self-produced EPs in 2000 and 2001, the band built a fan following in the San Francisco Bay Area. The band's full length concept album was announced for release in 2005, titled The Greatest Band Of All Time, and produced by Jamie Hill. British metal label Anticulture Records released the album in the UK and Europe in February 2006. After receiving critical praise in British magazines such as Metal Hammer and Total Guitar along with mainstream radio airplay on BBC Radio 1, ArnoCorps headlined tours of the UK and Ireland in the summers of 2006, 2008, 2012 and 2014. The first tour earned the band a 10 out of 10 rating from the BBC for a performance in Manchester, England, an appearance on commercial radio station Kerrang! 105.2 and a rave review of their London show in the October 2006 issue of Bizarre. In 2008, ArnoCorps was voted \"Best San Francisco (local) Rock Band\" by the readers of SF Weekly. The band started a Kickstarter program to fund their latest project, The Fantastic EP, which covers the Conan films among other new tracks."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Bloodbound is a Swedish power metal band formed in 2004. They released their first album, Nosferatu, in 2005 and their second, Book of the Dead, in May 2007. The brainchild of former Street Talk members Fredrik Bergh and Tomas Olsson, the band has also included Michael Bormann (Jaded Heart), Urban breed (Tad Morose) and Pelle \u00C5kerlind (Morgana Lefay). Their debut album Nosferatu featured former Tad Morose singer Urban breed on vocals. Released on 16 December 2005 (in Japan; European release date 24 February 2006), Nosferatu features artwork by Mark Wilkinson (Iron Maiden, Judas Priest, Marillion) and received an early rave review from the Swedish rock magazine Power Play. Based solely on the strength of their debut album, the band opened for Evergrey and headlined day one of the Gothenburg Metal Festival. After Urban breed announced his departure from Bloodbound in fall 2006, former Tad Morose singer Kristian Andr\u00E8n briefly joined the band for some live dates. In March 2007, they announced their new singer, German Michael Bormann, who laid down vocals on the band's second album Book of the Dead. Bormann, however, played no live shows with Bloodbound: for their first performance after releasing Book of the Dead (9 June 2007 at Sweden Rock Festival), Urban breed handled the vocal duties. Urban also performed with the band at subsequent shows, including Bolln\u00E4s Festivalen, 21 July 2007. Bloodbound played two sets, both backed up by a symphony orchestra. For the second set they backed Paul Di'Anno of Iron Maiden fame. In October 2007, they announced that original singer Urban breed had officially re-joined and would sing during the band's tour in support of HammerFall. On 13 April 2010, breed announced on his forum that Bloodbound had decided to continue with another singer, ending his second tenure with the band. Despite the band's apparent black metal image (the band members have worn make-up in the \"corpse paint\" style in the promotional photos on their albums and Web site, and during some live shows), Bloodbound's music does not fit into the black metal category. Instead, it is more similar in style to power metal bands such as Helloween and Iron Maiden, although the lyrics sometimes approach darker subjects. In 2009 the band signed a worldwide deal with the label Blistering Records for their third album release, titled Tabula Rasa. The album was set for release on 26 April 2009."@en ;

They wrote, produced, recorded, and distributed all of their music under the leadership of songwriter and producer Jeff Rosenstock. Rosenstock and several other contributors were previously members of The Arrogant Sons of Bitches. As that band was breaking up, Rosenstock recorded the first BtMI! song, \"Sweet Home Cananada,\" using his PowerBook's built-in microphone. \"I wrote that song and put it out to see if anybody wanted it. That was how it started, people showed interest and I like recording stuff.\" The band was known for their DIY punk ethic, embodied in actions such as distributing six albums worth of their own material for free on their website, and offering free stencils and paint for fans to create their own T-shirts. They also made it a point to play all-ages shows with ticket prices of $10 or less, and offered fans a chance to perform on stage if they learned a song and brought an instrument to the show. This sparked comparisons such as \"the Fugazi for the internet age of punk.\" Over time, the band's lineup shifted from \"pretty much a free-for-all\" to a fairly steady five-member lineup. In 2012, the band announced an indefinite hiatus, stating that their summer US tour would likely be their last because \"the 9 - 10 months of our lives when we are not playing music are not fantastic.\" They added, \"We are beautiful complicated fucking snowflakes that blow wherever the wind takes us and you better fucking respect that shit, maaaan.\" Following an international farewell tour in 2013, the band played their final show in Brooklyn on January 19, 2014. BTMI recordings have been featured on television shows such as Weeds and The Office."@en ;

His last gig with them was November 2015. On March 6, 2016 the band informed their fans of Ryder's decision to leave the group by placing a link to a Noise 11 article on their Facebook page. The article also announced that Ryder would be replaced by ex-CDB and Australia's Got Talent winner Andrew De Silva. The group also includes Peter 'Maz' Maslen on drums, percussion and vocals; Greg O'Connor on keyboards and guitar; and from 1992 Ian Tilley on bass guitar and vocals. Their top 20 albums are Boom Crash Opera (September 1987), These Here Are Crazy Times (October 1989), and Fabulous Beast (March 1993). Their top 20 singles are \"Great Wall\", \"Hands up in the Air\" (both 1986), \"Onion Skin\" (1989) and \"Gimme\" (1994). In the United States \"Onion Skin\" reached No. 8 on the Billboard component chart, Modern Rock Tracks. Australian musicologist, Ian McFarlane, noted that the group had a \"strong visual image and the uncanny ability of its principal songwriters to pen catchy, commercial songs ensured a string of successful releases\"."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Calle 13 was a Puerto Rican band formed by stepbrothers Ren\u00E9 P\u00E9rez Joglar (born February 23, 1978 in Hato Rey) who calls himself Residente (lead singer, songwriter) and Eduardo Jos\u00E9 Cabra Mart\u00EDnez (born September 10, 1978 in Santurce), who calls himself Visitante (multi-instrumentalist, vocalist, beat producer) and their half-sister Ileana Cabra Joglar aka PG-13 or recently ILE (backing vocals). Stepbrothers P\u00E9rez and Cabra first got a record deal with White Lion Records after sending the label a demo tape, and after the controversial song \"Querido F.B.I.\" was released, the group gained notoriety in Puerto Rico. In 2005, Calle 13 released its eponymously titled debut album, which became very popular due to the singles \"Se Vale T\u00F3-T\u00F3\" and \"\u00A1Atr\u00E9vete-te-te!\". In 2007, the group released its second album, Residente o Visitante, which was also very successful and experimented with a wide variety of genres. The album helped the group gain success throughout Latin America and win three Latin Grammys. The group released its third album, Los de Atr\u00E1s Vienen Conmigo, in 2008, which won Album of the Year at the 2009 Latin Grammy Awards. Calle 13 released Entren Los Que Quieran in November 2010 and its latest album, Multi Viral, on March 1, 2014. Calle 13 is noted for its eclectic musical style, often using unconventional instrumentation in its music, which distances the group from the reggaeton genre. The band is also known for its satirical lyrics as well as social commentary about Latin American issues and culture. The stepbrothers are strong supporters of the Puerto Rican independence movement, a stance that has generated controversy. For their work, the group has won twenty-one Latin Grammy Awards, holding the record for the most Latin Grammy wins. They have also won three Grammy Awards."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Carabao (Thai: \u0E04\u0E32\u0E23\u0E32\u0E1A\u0E32\u0E27) is a Thai rock band that is very popular in Thailand and other Asian countries. The group was formed in 1981 by university students Yuenyong Opakul (Aed) and Kirati Promsaka Na Sakon Nakhon (Keo or Khiao) who met while studying at Map\u00FAa Institute of Technology in the Philippines. The word carabao means \"buffalo\", a symbol of fighting, hard work, and patience. They are known for their Phleng phuea chiwit (\u0E40\u0E1E\u0E25\u0E07\u0E40\u0E1E\u0E37\u0E48\u0E2D\u0E0A\u0E35\u0E27\u0E34\u0E15) or 'songs for life'. This kind of music came to prominence through the protest songs of the 1970s political upheaval in Thailand, especially from the band Caravan. Carabao have blended the acoustic/folk style of 'peua chiwit' with other forms of Thai music, western rock and country music, and various kinds of world music like Latin music and reggae, earning such labels as 'ethnic rockers' and 'Kings of 3Cha' or 'Rolling Stones of Asia'. MTV Asia calls them \"veteran\". Carabao's songs often tackle social and political issues, demanding social justice and taking on the causes of the ordinary Thai people, but they have also created love songs and more philosophical songs that carry messages for people everywhere. Lead singer/songwriter Aed Carabao is loved by many and is also famous for his sharp tongue and open criticism of corrupt politicians, big business, and environmental destruction. At least one or two songs on most albums up to the mid-'90s were banned by the government and coverage of the band rarely appeared on government TV and radio stations. Despite this, Carabao is the most popular Thai rock group of all time. Carabao reached cult status long ago and is now one of the most successful legendary rock groups in the world. They have been compared to the rock band U2."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Celtic Woman is an all-female Irish musical ensemble conceived and created by David Kavanagh, Sharon Browne and David Downes, a former musical director of the Irish stage show Riverdance. In 2004, he recruited five Irish female musicians who had not previously performed together: vocalists Chlo\u00EB Agnew, \u00D3rla Fallon, Lisa Kelly and M\u00E9av N\u00ED Mhaolchatha, and fiddler M\u00E1ir\u00E9ad Nesbitt, and shaped them into the first lineup of the group that he named \"Celtic Woman,\" a specialty group. Downes chose a repertoire that ranged from traditional Celtic tunes to modern songs. The group's line-up has changed over the years; in 2009, the group consisted of Chlo\u00EB Agnew, Lynn Hilary, Lisa Kelly, Alex Sharpe and fiddler M\u00E1ir\u00E9ad Nesbitt; Alex Sharpe left the group in May 2010. Ten albums have been released under the name \"Celtic Woman:\" Celtic Woman, Celtic Woman: A Christmas Celebration, Celtic Woman: A New Journey, Celtic Woman: The Greatest Journey, Celtic Woman: Songs from the Heart, Celtic Woman: Lullaby, Celtic Woman: Believe, Celtic Woman: Home for Christmas,\" \"Celtic Woman: Emerald - Musical Gems. and Celtic Woman: Destiny. The group has undertaken a number of world tours. Cumulatively, albums by Celtic Woman have sold over nine million records worldwide. The foundation for Celtic music's popularity outside Ireland and Europe was built by tapping into the success of artists such as Enya, Moya Brennan and Clannad, along with stage shows Riverdance and Lord of the Dance. Celtic Woman has been described as being \"Riverdance for the voice.\" Celtic Woman has been named Billboard World Album Artist of the Year six times."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Centro-matic was an American band based in Denton, Texas. It started in 1995 as a side-project for Will Johnson. It released a few singles that year and grew into a full-fledged group in 1997. The initial 60 songs recorded in a Millstadt, Illinois studio supplied the material for the quieter, more emotional Navigational on Idol Records and the louder, lo-fi The Static vs. the Strings, Vol. 1 on Quality Park Records. Throughout his career, Johnson has had a reputation for being prolific and dynamic. So much so, that he built an entirely separate band, the much quieter side-project, South San Gabriel, named after the San Gabriel river fork north of Austin, Texas. The group consists of the same players from Centro-matic with the inclusion of guests, but focuses on more introspective and subdued offerings from Johnson's repertoire. Will has alternated between the two projects, while also releasing solo albums. Centro-matic released Distance and Clime on Idol in 2001 and \"Love You Just the Same\" on Misra in 2003. South San Gabriel released Welcome, Convalescense and The Carlton Chronicles in 2003 and 2005, respectively. Johnson's solo albums, Murder of Tides and Vultures Await, appeared in 2002 and 2004. Centro-matic followed up Love You Just the Same with Fort Recovery in March 2006. The two-disc set Dual Hawks was released in 2008, with one disc featuring the songs of Centro-matic and the other featuring South San Gabriel. Johnson was recently introduced as an \"official member\" of the band Monsters of Folk, also consisting of Conor Oberst, Jim James, and M. Ward, on an episode of Austin City Limits the group performed on. On the taping, and on tour, Johnson serves as the band's drummer, provides backup vocals, as well as performing some material of his own. Johnson was also a member of the group The Undertow Orchestra, featuring David Bazan, Mark Eitzel and the late Vic Chesnutt.Johnson and Scott Danbom have performed as part of Drive-By Truckers frontman Patterson Hood's band, during his solo tours. In September, 2014 the band announced that it would cease performing following their December, 2014 tour. They played their final show at Dan's Silverleaf in Denton, Texas on December 21, 2014."@en ;

They didn't expect the remix to be so successful in Brazilian dance clubs and playlists. After that, Angel and Dreams (written by Gisele) were recorded and Dalimas became one of the most famous dance groups in Brazil. On 2004, Gisele performed Livin' On A Prayer and Dreams at the 2004 Planet Pop Festival, a two-day dance music festival in S\u00E3o Paulo, Brazil, in front of more than 7.000 people. In the same night, Lasgo and Ian Van Dahl also performed. On 2005, they were back in the second edition of the Festival, performing in the same night as Jan Wayne, Cuva and Magic Box. When 2006 arrived, Dalimas had a massive and loyal fanbase, including an official fanclub and a 6.000 members community in Orkut. Gisele performed songs from her debut album \"Dreams\" on the 2006 Planet Pop Festival, in front of an estimated 10.000 people and on the same night as Belgian dance acts Lasgo and Ian Van Dahl."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Panic! at the Disco is an American rock band from Las Vegas, Nevada, formed in 2004 and featuring the current lineup of vocalist Brendon Urie, accompanied on tour by bassist Dallon Weekes, guitarist Kenneth Harris and drummer Dan Pawlovich. Founded by childhood friends Ryan Ross, Spencer Smith, Brent Wilson and Brendon Urie, Panic! at the Disco recorded its first demos while its members were in high school. Shortly after, the band recorded and released its debut studio album, A Fever You Can't Sweat Out (2005). Popularized by the lead single, \"I Write Sins Not Tragedies\", the album was certified double platinum in the US. In 2006, founding bassist Brent Wilson was fired from the band during an extensive world tour, and subsequently replaced by Jon Walker. Influenced by 1960s rock bands the Beatles, the Zombies and the Beach Boys, and preceded by the hit single, \"Nine in the Afternoon\", the band's second studio album, Pretty. Odd. (2008), marked a significant departure from the sound of the band's debut, and ultimately led to the departure of guitarist and principal songwriter Ryan Ross and bassist Jon Walker, who favored the band's new direction. The duo subsequently formed a new band, the Young Veins, leaving Brendon Urie and Spencer Smith as the sole remaining members of Panic! at the Disco. Continuing as a duo, Urie and Smith released a new single, \"New Perspective\", and recruited Dallon Weekes as the group's bassist and Ian Crawford as the band's lead guitarist to accompany the band during live performances. Weekes was later inducted into the band's lineup as a full-time member in 2010, nearing the end of the recording of the band's third studio album, Vices & Virtues (2011). The album was recorded solely by Urie and Smith, with producers John Feldmann and Butch Walker. As a three-piece, Urie, Smith, and Weekes recorded and released the band's fourth studio album, Too Weird to Live, Too Rare to Die!, in 2013. Prior to the release of the album, Smith unofficially left the band due to health and drug-related issues, leaving Urie and Weekes as the remaining members. In 2015, Smith officially left the band after not performing live with the band since his departure in 2013. Shortly thereafter, Weekes reverted to being a touring member once again, leaving Brendon Urie as the only member of the official lineup. In April 2015, \"Hallelujah\" was released as the first single from Panic! at the Disco's fifth studio album, Death of a Bachelor (2016)."@en ;

The group is most notable for basing their first two and the fifth album upon the self-produced The Dragonland Chronicles fantasy saga and for the original symphonic/electronic parts by Elias Holmlid. The band was founded in September/October 1999 by guitarist Nicklas Magnusson and Jonas Heidgert. Soon after Daniel Kvist, Magnus Olin and Christer Pederson joined in. Their first demo was recorded on January 2000. Only 3 months before the recording of their debut album, The Battle of the Ivory Plains started, Kvist decided to leave the band and was soon replaced by Olof M\u00F6rck. The album was released on April 30, 2001, and the second album, Holy War, was released on February 8, 2002. Both featured singer Jonas Heidgert on drums. In 2003, Dragonland invited Japanese power metal band Galneryus to play with throughout the Japan tour. That was also the first time Dragonland performed the song, \"to the End of the World\", which was included a year later in their third album, Starfall, which was released on October 27, 2004, featuring Jesse Lindskog on drums. Johanna Andersson, Tom S. Englund and Henrik Danhage (Tom and Henrik from Evergrey) provided guest performances on the album, including vocals and guitar solos. Their fourth album, Astronomy, was released on November 11, 2006. Nightrage's Marios Iliopoulos, Amaranthe's Elize Ryd and Jake E and Dead by April's Jimmie Strimell provided guest appearances on this album. Work on a fifth Dragonland album was announced via Blabbermouth on the 27th of April, 2008. In September 2009, Dragonland launched their re-designed Myspace site, together with a high-quality preproduction of \"The Shadow of The Mithril Mountains\", a song from the fifth album. It took some time before the album was completely ready.Five years after \"Astronomy\" the band finally released the new album, Under the Grey Banner, on November 11, 2011. Where \"Starfall\" and \"Astronomy\" are two separate albums, \"Under the Grey Banner\" continues the story of their first two albums. On October 25, 2014, it was announced that there will be two new albums, which are a reissue of the first album, the Battle of the Ivory Plains, and a remastered version of the second album, Holy War. Both albums will have brand new cover artwork, and they will be released on December 5 this year. In the first album, there will also be a new song, \"a New Dawn\", as its bonus track. That song does not resemble Evergrey's new song, \"a New Dawn\" (Evergrey is the progressive metal band whose guitarists Tom S. Englund (who is also the lead singer) and Henrik Danhage contributed to Dragonland's third album, Starfall, as mentioned above)."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Electric President is a Jacksonville, Florida musical group started in 2003 by Ben Cooper and Alex Kane. Both were in Helicopter Project prior to its breakup though no music from this group was ever released. Afterwards the pair decided to continue to make music together. They subsequently completed three albums in six months. Ben Cooper is also a member of Radical Face (Formerly known as Radical Face Versus Phalex Sledgehammer), Iron Orchestra, and Mother's Basement. The Electric President tracks and most of Ben Coopers projects are recorded in a tool shed in back of his house that he has converted into a recording studio. Electric President's first release was a pseudo-eponymous album (named \"Self-Titled\" rather than \"Electric President\") in early 2006. They gained limited mainstream fame after their music was featured on Fox Network's hit show The OC. At the end of the thirteenth episode of season three, titled \"The Pot Stirrer\", the song \"Insomnia\" is prominently featured in the closing sequence. Electric President's self-titled debut album, S/T, was released in 2006 on German electronica label Morr Music. The record Sleep Well was released June 9, 2008 for Europe and June 24, 2008 for the US. In Mid-April 2008, the album leaked on file-sharing networks. In 2009 Electric President left Morr Music and released their third album, The Violent Blue, with Fake Four Inc. The album was largely made up of songs left over from the making of the groups previous album, Sleep Well. After The Violent Blue, Electric President went into hiatus as Alex Kane wanted to further his career and Ben Cooper focused on other projects, like Radical Face. Electric President's mix of glitch, electronica and indie songwriting has been compared to The Postal Service, Styrofoam, The Weakerthans and Anticon's cLOUDDEAD. In 2013, Ben Cooper announced on the Radical Face website that himself and Alex were planning a fourth Electric President album. He also hinted that it could be a dance record."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"The EAV (Erste Allgemeine Verunsicherung, German for \"First General Confusion/Uninsurance\") is an Austrian band that was formed in 1977. Nino Holm first established a band called \"Anti-Pasta\", but it was not successful and it dissolved after three years. Holm then decided together with his friend Thomas Spitzer to create a new band. While they were undecided on a name, they saw a bus stop in a branch of \"Erste Allgemeine Versicherung\" (\"First General Insurance\"), abbreviated EAV, and so they came to the name \"Erste Allgemeine Verunsicherung-EAV\". They initially faced legal difficulty in Austria due to the (obviously intended) similarity of their band name to that of the corporation \"Erste Allgemeine Versicherung\". This was later dropped and the insurance company was even known to sponsor them on a few occasions. The EAV often changed their members. Their members as of today are Klaus Eberhartinger (Vocals), Thomas Spitzer (Guitar, Vocals), Kurt Keinrath (Guitar, Keyboard, bass guitar), Franz Kreimer (Keyboard), Alvis Reid (Bass guitar) and Aaron Thier (Drums). The stage shows are known for lavishness in both backdrop and costumes, the latter often selected and changed for specific songs that are then acted out by either the vocalist or other members. Despite the band's failed attempt to gain international fame, they still remain quite popular in Germany and Austria."@en ;

Other projects include live performance, film, comics and the Flaming Fire Illustrated Bible (described as the largest illustrated Bible in the world). The band is on avant rock label Silly Bird Records, home to bands like Autobody and the Irving Klaw Trio. Their projects and music have been featured in such news and music publications as The New York Times, Arthur Magazine, The New Yorker, Vice Magazine, The Boston Globe, Venus Magazine, The Omaha World Herald, The Omaha Reader, The Lincoln Journal Star, Blastitude, Dead Angel, Mick Mercer's The Mick and Baltimore City Paper. The group features cartoonist Lauren Weinstein on lead vocals with Patrick Hambrecht, the band songwriter. Hambrecht, a Southern Baptist from Papillion, Nebraska, moved to New York City in 1996. Their music has been described as a mix of psychedelic folk, noise music and pop music, similar to other New Weird America artists, but with a more aggressive, transgressive bent, akin to bands like Psychic TV. The group's prior incarnation, Rock Rock Chicken Pox, featured Dame Darcy and members of Laddio Bolocko. The band has three albums; Get Old and Die with Flaming Fire, Songs from the Shining Temple and When the High Bell Rings. Their music has been featured on various compilations, including WFMU's Tunes From the Toxic Terrain and Psycho-O-Path Records' Space is No Place, NYC: Noise from the Underground.

	dbo:abstract	"Fools Garden is a German musical group, formed in 1991 under the name Fool's Garden, comprising singer Peter Freudenthaler, guitarist Volker Hinkel, bassist Thomas Mangold, keyboardist Roland R\u00F6hl and drummer Ralf Wochele. They debuted in 1991 with the eponymous album Fool's Garden (where the band was essentially formed by Freudenthaler and Hinkel with additional musicians), while the proper first album which saw the complete band was Once in a Blue Moon (1993). Two years later Fool's Garden issued their third album Dish of the Day, scoring a European and Asian chart hit with \"Lemon Tree\". The re-issued track peaked at #26 in the UK Singles Chart in August 1996. Go And Ask Peggy For The Principal Thing followed in 1997, along with three albums in 2000, 2003 and 2005. In 2003, three members left the band, and were replaced by Dirk Bl\u00FCmlein (bassist), Claus M\u00FCller (drummer) and Gabriel Holz (second guitarist, who then left the band in 2007), and the name of the band changed to Fools Garden (without the apostrophe). The band has taken the habit of covering rock and roll songs during live performances (The Beatles' \"Ticket to Ride\" or The Who's \"My Generation\"). Fools Garden's interest in British music is such that cover versions of The Beatles's songs \"Cry Baby Cry\" and \"Martha My Dear\" appeared on their studio albums. The band released a greatest hits compilation album in October 2009.

There was some controversy in the Swedish mass media at the time regarding the song's lyrics. They ended up on the top charts for the first time with the album Alwayz Somethang (1997) and the single \"Caught up in da Game\". With the album The Face (2001) and the songs \"She\u2019s A Freak\", \"Bullet\", \"Blazin\", and \"Enter The Dragon\" they established a characteristic style: a G-funk base with a blend of heavy guitars, rapping, singing, and unusual samplings. In 2004 they had a Swedish hit with the song \"No. 1 Swartskalle\" (Svartskalle is a traditionally derogatory Swedish slang term for immigrants that are non-blonde and non-Nordic looking.) Infinite Mass is, alongside The Latin Kings and Looptroop, one of the more important groups that has emerged from the Swedish hip hop scene."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"INVSN (formerly Invasionen and before that The Lost Patrol Band) is the music project of Swedish Punk rock musician Dennis Lyxz\u00E9n. In contrast to his other projects, Refused and The (International) Noise Conspiracy, this started out as a solo career and much more folkish and softer than his prior music endeavors. The band was previously called the Lost Patrol Band; however, the name was changed because the American group, The Lost Patrol holds the North American trademark on the name. As the name changed, the band started to write music in Swedish. In 1999, Lyxz\u00E9n put together a release titled \"Songs in the Key of Resistance\" which was written in the political vein that Lyxz\u00E9n's fans best know him for. The album received mixed reactions. Critics often blasted the album for straying from its creator's punk roots, while others were impressed by Lyxz\u00E9n's ability to diversify his musical output. The Lost Patrol returned in 2003 with \"Songs about Running Away\". According to Lyxz\u00E9n, the album had been supposed to be just as subversive and political as his previous album, yet due to relationship problems, it ended up being an emotional outburst. Guests such as David Sandstr\u00F6m (Refused), Stefan Granberg (Randy) and Lisa Miskovsky helped to make this album one of Lyxz\u00E9n's most experimental. In 2005, Burning Heart Records reported that The Lost Patrol has grown from Lyxz\u00E9n's solo project into a full-fledged band. This is reflected in the title of the 2005 album The Lost Patrol Band. The album also represents a further change in style, this time encompassing the upbeat sounds of 1970s/'80s punk and power pop. In 2013 the group signed to Razor & Tie and changed their name to INVSN."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Kryst the Conqueror (Pronounced \"Christ the Conqueror\") was an American Christian metal project formed in August of 1987 by two former members of the horror punk band, The Misfits. The project was led by bassist Jerry Only, who adopted a new stage name, \"Mo The Great\" (or alternately, \"Mocavious Kryst\"), and his younger brother, guitarist Doyle Wolfgang von Frankenstein. The band fused fantastical and sci-fi imagery with religious themes and messages. The band has also been referred to as a \"guitar shop project\", as Only and Doyle constantly tweaked and refined their instruments throughout the band's existence, in an attempt to create what they felt would be the ultimate bass and guitar. In 1988, they formed The Doyle Fan Club in order to promote the new project and stay in touch with fans of The Misfits. According to various interviews conducted at the time, and a series of fan club letters written by Jerry Only (as \"Mo The Great\") from 1988 to 1990, Kryst the Conqueror was meant to be Only's vision of the \"perfect\" band. He hoped the \"righteous\" message of the band would reach out to fans, especially those who had followed former Misfits frontman, Glenn Danzig's post-Misfits career with the bands Samhain and Danzig - bands which Jerry felt were satanic, evil and possibly damaging to impressionable youths. A full album, Deliver Us From Evil, was recorded, although it has never been officially released in its entirety. Instead, five of the album's tracks were released in 1990 as an EP for a special Christmas package. The band never had an official lead singer, although noted Yngwie Malmsteen vocalist, Jeff Scott Soto, was hired to record vocals for the album. Although it has been rumoured for many years that Soto was under contract with Malmsteen this is in fact untrue. Soto set the record straight in and interview about his time recording the vocals for their debut in March 2015, he was billed on the EP as \"Kryst the Conqueror\"). Also, Dave \"The Snake\" Sabo did a guest guitar solo on the song \"Spellbound.\" Though the band never played live, Kryst the Conqueror survived as a non-active band until 1995, at which time Jerry and Doyle reached an out of court settlement with Glenn Danzig, granting them the rights to perform as The Misfits. Kryst the Conqueror was then quickly revamped into what would become the second incarnation of The Misfits. Some Kryst the Conqueror songs were eventually re-written into songs for the \"resurrected\" Misfits."@en ;

While they were inspired by another Slovenian radical band Buldo\u017Eer known for utilizing sheer madness in the social and political satire, their lyrics is more self-ironic. The band was formed in Maribor in June 1979. Their name, meaning hungry Franz, is a pun on the name of a character from the novel Catch-22, Hungry Joe, and describes hunger for rock music. The band's music and attitude was a kind of laid back, and they portrayed themselves as a local band from a provincial town. Zoran Predin's lyrics ranged from disturbing ballads (Ne mi dihat za ovratnik, Lipa zelenela je), through love songs (\u010Cakaj me, Naj ti poljub nari\u0161e ustnice), to social and political satire (Praslovan, Na\u0161a Lidija je pri vojakih). The key band members were frontman and songwriter Zoran Predin, and guitarist Oto Rimele. The band made the most creative success by the end of the 1980s, with classical albums such as Ikebana, Adijo pamet, Ne mi dihat za ovratnik, and Na svoji strani (the last one made with the original crew). Their last studio album was released in 1994. La\u010Dni Franz officially ceased to exist in 1997 after a series of compilation albums. Zoran Predin continued solo career after the Franz disbanded. Many band's hits, such as Praslovan, Bog nima telefona, Vaterpolist, Ne mi dihat za ovratnik, \u010Cakaj me or Naj ti poljub nari\u0161e ustnice, have remained in his concert repertoire. The band briefly regathered in winter 2005 - 2006, and held a series of concerts in Slovenia, Belgrade, and Zagreb."@en ;

The band changed their name to Love Outside Andromeda to avoid confusion with the Swedish band of the same name. The band have since released two studio albums; Love Outside Andromeda (2004) and Longing Was a Safe Place to Hide (2006), both on Shock records. The band announced a hiatus at the start of 2007 however, as each of the members are now involved in significant other projects, there are no plans to reunite."@en ;

Luca Turilli's name was added to the \"Dreamquest\" title to avoid confusion with a little-known French band. Turilli developed the band to focus on his ability on the keyboard as his previous two projects mainly demonstrated his talent on the guitar and drums. The identity of the vocalist, credited only as \"Mystique\", is still in question. Fans have speculated Mystique's identity to be Bridget Fogle, who contributed to Turilli's 3rd album The Infinite Wonders of Creation, but as of 2015, this has not been confirmed. Shortly after the release of Lost Horizons, Turilli began work on a second Dreamquest album. In December 2006, it was reported that only the mixing was left to be completed. In 2011, however, Turilli ended work on all his various projects to concentrate on the newly formed Luca Turilli's Rhapsody."@en ;

The original members were Patty Brard, Jos\u00E9 Hoebee and Marga Scheide. In 1979, Luv' was \"Holland's best export act\" and thus received the \"Conamus Export Prize\". The band sold more than seven million records worldwide (singles and albums). Among their greatest hits were: U.O.Me (Welcome To Waldolala), You're the Greatest Lover, Trojan Horse, Casanova and Ooh, Yes I Do. The formation went through line-up changes and the original singers reunited several times. They had a hectic schedule between 2006 and 2008. They gave a farewell performance on August 11, 2012 in Spaarnwoude at the Dutch Valley Festival. Two members of the pop act have had a successful solo career in their homeland: Patty as a TV personality and Jos\u00E9 as a vocalist.

	foaf:name	"Minnesota Youth Symphonies"@en ;
	dbo:abstract	"Minnesota Youth Symphonies, commonly referred to as MYS, was founded in 1972 by Ralph Winkler. The program has four orchestras composed of elementary through high school-aged musicians. Participation is based on an audition in which the prospective student must perform an appropriate solo, orchestral excerpt, scales and arpeggios, and must sight-read. Placement is based solely on audition results, rather than age. The String Orchestra, composed only of stringed instruments, is conducted by Pat Kelly, and is for students at the intermediate level. The Philharmonic Orchestra, conducted by Former Minnesota Orchestra Education Director Jim Bartsch, is a full orchestra for music students at the advanced-intermediate level. The Repertory Orchestra, conducted by MYS Co-Artistic Director Claudette Laureano, is offered for advanced students. The highest-level orchestra, the Symphony Orchestra, is conducted by MYS Co-Artistic Director Manny Laureano, and is a collegiate-level full orchestra. The orchestras perform three major concerts in the Twin Cities area, primarily at Orchestra Hall in Minneapolis. There are also other performance opportunities throughout the year. Student musicians throughout Minnesota and western Wisconsin audition annually for a position in one of the four orchestras, which rehearse on Saturday mornings. MYS also hosts various workshops and classes, and an annual summer music program that usually consists of a Chamber String workshop and a Composition workshop. Directors MYS has been under the artistic direction of Manny Laureano, principal trumpet of the Minnesota Orchestra, and his wife, Claudette Laureano, director of the Breck School's String Program, since 1988. Previous music/artistic directors have included Ralph Winkler, Ed Forner (former Assistant Conductor with the St. Paul Chamber Orchestra and Professor of Music at Macalester College), William McGlaughlin, Dr. Clyn D. Barrus and David Tuburgen. Under Winkler and Forner's initial leadership, MYS grew from a single orchestra to 3 ensembles ranging from beginning students to college-level musicians. Under Dr. Barrus' leadership, MYS grew to four orchestras and over 400 students. Under the Laureanos' leadership, MYS became known nationally as one of the nation's leading youth symphony organizations, adding a summer program and community outreach programs serving over 600 students. Alumni Several alumni of the Minnesota Youth Symphonies program hold positions with professional orchestras, such as the Cleveland Orchestra, Minnesota Orchestra, the Dallas Symphony Orchestra, the Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra and the St. Paul Chamber Orchestra.[1] Notable Years In 1972, the St. Paul Chamber Orchestra Society ended its sponsorship of the St. Paul Youth Orchestra. Many of the youth orchestra musicians and their parents were determined to continue the program. They persuaded its music director, Ralph Winkler, to establish a new youth orchestra, the Minnesota Youth Symphony. MYS was established as a place for serious young musicians to learn and be challenged. The students\u2019 hard work earned them an invitation in 1973 to perform in Romania, making MYS the first American youth orchestra to tour in a communist country. In 1992, the MYS Symphony Orchestra became the first orchestra to ever perform in the Super Bowl\u2019s half-time show when Super Bowl XXVI was played at the Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome in Minneapolis. MYS worked with one of the most distinguished film composers of the 20th century when Elmer Bernstein guest-conducted \u201CThe Magnificent Seven\u201D with the MYS Philharmonic Orchestra in 1997. MYS has collaborated with many noted guest artists, conductors and performing groups including Minnesota Orchestra Music Director Osmo Vanska, Butch Thompson, Charles Lazarus, Jorja Fleezanis, Bel Canto Chorus, St. Paul City Ballet, Minnesota Boys Choir, Ignacio \"Nachito\" Herrera, Doc Severinsen and the T.C. Swing Dancers, among many others. In the winter of 2007, MYS Symphony Orchestra, under the baton of Manny Laureano, performed Stravinksy's \"Rite of Spring\" in concert at Orchestra Hall, which was a first for MYS and maybe any other youth orchestra in Minnesota. The 2007-2008 season was particularly notable, as it marked the 35th Anniversary of MYS as well as the 20th Anniversary of Co-Artistic Directors Claudette and Manny Laureano. In honour of these events, each of the Minnesota Youth Symphonies\u2019 four orchestras premiered original works by Minnesotan composers. Full orchestral pieces were commissioned from composers Stephen Paulus, Shelley Hanson and MYS alumnus Edward (Teddy) Niedermaier. To select the fourth work, MYS held a composition competition open to MYS students and alumni under the age of 21. Aaron Hirsch, of Sleepy Eye, Minnesota won this contest with his composition for string orchestra. Since then, MYS has celebrated 40 years in existence, and the Laureanos have continued in artistic leadership. MYS has continued to collaborate with various artists and organizations from the Twin Cities and beyond. In 2015, MYS was invited to take part in the opening concerts at the newly renovated Ordway. During the roughly two-year renovation of Orchestra Hall, MYS has performed in various venues around the Twin Cities, such as churches and concert halls. The four orchestras continue to excel in artistic excellence season after season, and the MYS organization continues to expand in opportunities for youth to grow artistically and to be exposed to the best orchestral music education possible."@en ;

Currently, this line-up remains intact, with the exception of Lewis, who left the group to focus on his marriage to Toni Braxton and produce for her and other artists. The group is well known for its diverse musical style (able to play anything from traditional jazz to mainstream R&B and rock-based music to funk grooves and even Latin and Jamaican-based rhythms) and also its captivating live performances. The band is also well known for their well written and produced R&B ballads, mainly in the 1990s.

The band is composed of two brothers, Luther Dickinson (guitar, lowebow, vocals) and Cody Dickinson (drums, keyboards, electric washboard), and Chris Chew (electric bass guitar). Duwayne Burnside, who formerly played second guitar in the band, is a son of R. L. Burnside, who also played on some of the band's tracks. The Allstars' first release, Shake Hands with Shorty, was nominated for a Grammy Award for \"Best Contemporary Blues Album\". Since then, 51 Phantom and Electric Blue Watermelon have received nominations in the same category. The group also won a Blues Music Award for \"Best New Artist Debut\" in 2001. The band made its network television debut in 2000 on Late Night with Conan O'Brien and served as the house band on the program Last Call with Carson Daly for a short period in 2004. The band backs and tours with John Hiatt and released an album with him, Master of Disaster. All the members of the Allstars have also teamed up with Robert Randolph and John Medeski to form the Word. In November 2007, Luther Dickinson joined the Black Crowes as lead guitarist and has appeared on their albums Warpaint (2008), Before the Frost...Until the Freeze (2009) and Croweology (2010). He currently devotes his time to both the Black Crowes and the North Mississippi Allstars. Cody Dickinson has also started a side project, Hill Country Revue, featuring Daniel Coburn, Kirk Smithhart, Doc Samba and Ed Cleveland. They are sometimes joined by Luther Dickinson and members of the Burnside family. They have released two albums, Make a Move (2009) and Zebra Ranch (2010). Luther and Cody Dickinson's father was the Memphis musician and record producer Jim Dickinson. Besides releasing music in his own name, he worked with Ry Cooder, Bob Dylan, the Rolling Stones, and Primal Scream. Jim Dickinson also established the Zebra Ranch recording studio complex during the 1990s in Hernando, Mississippi. His career spanned more than four decades before his death, on August 15, 2009. The band opened for Robert Plant and the Band of Joy on their concert tour in 2011. They also opened for the Dave Matthews Band in the spring of 2013. The band released the album World Boogie Is Coming in 2013 and the album Freedom & Dreams in 2015. In 2015, Luther Dickinson announced that Chris Chew had left the band."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Pain (typeset as PAIN) is a musical project from Sweden that mix heavy metal with influences from electronic music and techno. The project started out as a hobby project for front man Peter T\u00E4gtgren, whose idea was to fuse heavy metal with 1980s-inspired electro-industrial and techno influences. T\u00E4gtgren, who is also the vocalist/guitarist of Hypocrisy and producer of his own The Abyss studios, is the only current member. Pain's self-titled debut was released in 1997, and since then Pain has released six more albums and a DVD. Starting with their second, all of Pain's albums have made the Swedish charts, thanks in large part to hit singles such as \"End of the Line\", \"Shut Your Mouth\", and \"Same Old Song\". In early February 2006, Blabbermouth.net reported that Pain had signed with Roadrunner Records. Currently, Pain is under the Nuclear Blast Records banner. In 2008, Pain was on tour as a supporting performer for the Finnish symphonic power metal band Nightwish. During this tour singer Peter T\u00E4gtgren, drummer David Wallin, and bassist Johan Husgafvel were assaulted by a gang in Leipzig. T\u00E4gtgren received 10 stitches in his face, Wallin suffered a concussion and stitches to his head, and Husgafvel had his nose broken. Pain supported Nightwish on the second half of their Dark Passion Play World Tour, along with Finnish pop rock band Indica, beginning with the first show in London, UK on 11 March 2009. Pain released their seventh album, You Only Live Twice, on 3 June 2011 via Nuclear Blast. They released their eighth studio album entitled Coming Home on September 9, 2016."@en ;

The group released its debut album All We Know Is Falling in 2005, with the album reaching number eight on the UK Rock Chart and number thirty on Billboard's Heatseekers Chart. While it only had a minimal commercial performance initially, the album and its lead single \"Pressure\" were eventually certified Gold by the RIAA after the success of the band's later material. The band's second album, Riot!, was released in 2007. Due to the success of the singles \"Misery Business\", \"crushcrushcrush\", and \"That's What You Get\", Riot! was a mainstream success and was certified Platinum in the United States. They then received a Best New Artist nomination at the 2008 Grammy Awards. Their 2009 follow-up, Brand New Eyes, is the band's second-highest charting album to date, landing at number two on the Billboard 200 with 175,000 first week sales. It produced the top-forty single \"The Only Exception\" and went platinum in Ireland and the UK, as well as gold in the US, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. Following the departure of Josh and Zac Farro in 2010, the band released their self-titled fourth album in 2013. It gave the band their first career number one on the US Billboard 200 and was also the number one album in the United Kingdom, Ireland, Australia, New Zealand, Brazil, Argentina and Mexico. It included the singles \"Still Into You\" and \"Ain't It Fun\", with the latter winning the Grammy Award for Best Rock Song for Hayley Williams and Taylor York as songwriters, making it Paramore's first Grammy win.

	dbo:abstract	"The Pat McGee Band is a rock band from Richmond, Virginia. Formed by frontman Pat McGee, who attended Longwood University in Farmville, VA. On the heels of his solo release From the Wood in 1995, the Pat McGee Band signed with Warner Bros. Records subsidiary Giant Records in 1999. Shine, the band's major-label debut, was released in 2000 with the national singles \"Runaway\" and \"Rebecca\". After two years of delays, the band released their second album with Warner, Save Me, in 2004. The band was dropped from the label that year and picked up by Kirtland Records. An enhanced Save Me is now being distributed through Kirtland with the radio single \"Must Have Been Love\". Former guitarist and vocalist Al Walsh left the band in an amicable split at the end of 2001. Keyboardist and vocalist Jonathan Williams left in 2003 but rejoined the band in late 2005. Both were significant contributors to the band's sound, particularly in the form of backing vocals. The band didn't see another background vocalist until the 2003 addition of keyboardist/guitarist Todd Wright. Longtime bassist John Small left the band in 2004. With Jonathan's return, Todd Wright has left the band. Todd is now finding success as the front man of his own band, Getaway Car, where he's backed by guitarist Matt Miceli and Crix Reardon - while still a part of Pat McGee Band - on bass. Drummer Chris Williams died peacefully in his home October 28, 2006. As of June 2007, the band has severed ties with Kirtland Records and is once again recording independently. As of 2008, Matt \"Chew\" Calvarese has increasingly sat in as the band's new drummer."@en ;

After a 3-year hiatus (during which Joe Pernice recorded under his own name and as Chappaquiddick Skyline), Pernice Brothers returned in 2001 with The World Won't End; after parting with Sub Pop, the album was released on Pernice's own label, Ashmont Records, co-owned with his long-time manager Joyce Linehan, which in 2003 released Yours, Mine and Ours. After a 2004 tour, the band released their first live album in early 2005, Nobody's Watching/Nobody's Listening, and, in June of the same year, released their fourth studio album, Discover a Lovelier You.

Their music is characterized by very short, thrashcore-like, fast songs thematically concerned with zombies and the apocalypse, as the band name would imply. Their lyrics have a political undercurrent that uses horrific imagery as a metaphor to touch on various political, personal, and social issues. They have released two albums: This Is a Spark of Life, on Indecision Records and featuring artwork by Dan Henk, and a split with Leeds, UK-based, and fellow zombie enthusiasts, Send More Paramedics, called Tales Told by Dead Men, released in North America on Hell Bent Records and in Europe on In at the Deep End Records. They also contributed a cover of Welcome to the Jungle to a Guns N' Roses tribute album released by Reignition Records. Although the term \"zombiecore\" has been used with reference to Zombie Apocalypse, the band itself has never made any claim to any specific genre."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Pinhead Gunpowder is an American punk rock band that formed in East Bay, California, in 1990. The band has consisted of Aaron Cometbus (drums, lyrics), Bill Schneider (bass), Billie Joe Armstrong (guitar, vocals) and Jason White (guitar, vocals) for the majority of its existence. Sarah Kirsch (guitar, vocals), formerly known as Mike Kirsch, was the original guitarist, in place of White, but left the band citing personal differences with Green Day (the band for which Billie Joe Armstrong is most famous) and their major label debut album Dookie (1994). The band's name comes from a brand of \"high octane\" green tea served at the Arcata co-op and discovered by Aaron Cometbus during one of his many dumpster diving adventures. Cometbus, who releases the Cometbus fanzine, has played in many East Bay area bands such as Crimpshrine, Sweet Baby, The Thorns of Life and many more; Schneider is Green Day's former guitar tech and tour manager. Jason White plays additional guitar for Green Day; along with founding the seminal punk rock band Chino Horde. White has played in The Influents as well as The Big Cats. Sarah Kirsch has also been an active member in several East Bay bands such as Fuel, Torches to Rome, Bread and Circuits and many others. The vast majority of Pinhead Gunpowder's songs were written by Cometbus, although a few songs such as \"27\", \"Anniversary Song\" and \"New Blood\" were written by Billie Joe Armstrong under the pseudonym \"Wilhelm Fink\". Pinhead Gunpowder is a very elusive band. Over their 24+ year existence they have only released a few albums and only played 18 shows in total (that are known of). All of these shows have been on the west coast of the USA, mostly in the Bay Area. Their two lead singers are both members of Green Day and because of that the majority of their time is spent recording and touring for Green Day. Founder, drummer, and lyricist Aaron Cometbus is also busy writing his Cometbus zine, several novels, and in 2014 his first volume of poetry as well as producing artwork and playing in numerous bands. As a result of their busy lives Cometbus wrote that they knew upon forming Pinhead Gunpowder that it would have to be a part-time band that they could all come back to when they had free time."@en ;

Al Jourgensen of Ministry has called them \"the best f**king band in the world.\" In addition to their touring, the band has also appeared several times on European television. The band was named after the Russian cosmonaut/dog Laika. As announced in an email to the band's mailing list on April 23, 2008, Laika and the Cosmonauts drew their twenty-year career to a close with an American tour, ending with shows at the Continental Club in Austin, Texas that fall. A compilation album, Cosmopolis, was released contemporaneously with the tour."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Fififf Teeners (or The 5:15ers) is the name given to the side project of musicians Josh Homme and Chris Goss. The alias of the duo was first used when they co-produced Queens of the Stone Age's Rated R, and again for the band's fifth studio album, Era Vulgaris. To date, the pair have only performed as the 5:15ers once, at the ArthurBall held at the Echoplex, a club in Echo Park, California. The set was a mix of tracks from both their respective careers, including a number of Masters of Reality songs, \"100 Days\" from Mark Lanegan's Bubblegum (Which both Goss and Homme contributed to) and \"You Would Know\" by Queens of the Stone Age. Another song played was a cover of \"Space For Rent\" by the Danish three-piece WhoMadeWho. The performance also included original work, with the song \"Into the Hollow\" later appearing on Era Vulgaris. When asked in February 2007 about the future of the project, Goss answered, \"There will be one show and more to follow. We're focusing on the show, but we have talked about doing a record\". Despite this, nothing has come into fruition since. On the band's musical direction, Goss opined that \"[It will be] something that's neither Masters of Reality or Queens of the Stone Age. This one will be more 'art fag.'\""@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Porno para Ricardo (English: Porn for Richard) is a Cuban rock band founded in 1998. It is considered to be one of the most visible examples of young Cubans disagreement with the Castro's rule. Their lyrics are mostly about politics and contemporary Cuban society, and are harshly critical of the Cuban government. Their lyrics are frequently very explicit and strongly critical of Castro. The band was originally well received by the Cuban cultural scene. However, in 2003 Gorki \u00C1guila, the leader of the band, was arrested under drugs charges at a music festival in Pinar del Rio. He was imprisoned for 4 years only to be released after serving 2 years in prison. After his release, his lyrics became increasingly political. In March 2004 Gorki was nominated for the British Index on Censorship prize in the category \"Music\". The critical stance of the group against the regime accelerated only to be prohibited and their website cancelled the same year. In August 2008 \u00C1guila was arrested by the Cuban police with the charge of dangerousness, which allows them to detain people whom they think they are likely to commit crimes. The charge carries a penalty of up to four years in prison. He was eventually ordered to pay a $30 fine (2 months salary) for the lesser offense of public disorder which he paid after some hesitation in coins, after prosecutors dropped the more serious charge following intense international pressure after broad media coverage. This is an unprecedented event in Cuban jurisprudence; the communist government is usually strict about punishment given to independent journalists and other dissident voices. The group organizes a small recording studio for other prohibited groups that cannot play in Cuba called Paja Recolds."@en ;
