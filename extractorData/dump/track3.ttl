In the United States in October 1985, the song became the only A-ha song to reach the top position of the Billboard Hot 100, due in no small part to the wide exposure on MTV of its innovative music video, directed by Steve Barron.

	dbo:abstract	"\"Turn It On Again\" is a single from the English rock band Genesis, from their 1980 album Duke. It reached number 8 in the UK Singles Chart. The lyrics, written by Mike Rutherford, deal with a man who does nothing more than watch his television, so much that he becomes obsessed with the people he watches on it, believing them to be his friends. The song is also characterised by a rhythmic structure uncharacteristically complex for pop music but commonplace in the band's progressive rock back catalogue, with verse/chorus sections in alternating time signatures, 64 to 74 (134), while the intro and bridge sections are in 44 and 54 (94). The song was originally much slower, written mostly by Mike Rutherford, with help from Phil Collins. He explains in the Songbook DVD \"I had this riff, [plays lead riff on guitar] but at the time I was playing it like this, [plays slower] and Phil said 'why don't you try it in a faster speed?' and then he said to me 'do you realize it is in 138?' and I said 'What do you mean it's in 13? It's in 44 isn't it?' 'No, it's 13'\". Collins confirms \"You can't dance to it. You see people trying to dance to it every now and again, they get on the off beat but they don't know why\". \"Turn It On Again\" was built out of various left-over song sections from different projects by each member: The second set of verses was originally conceived by Tony Banks for A Curious Feeling, \"We kind of put [Rutherford's riff] \u2013 the bit he didn't use on Smallcreep's Day, curiously enough \u2013 with the bit I didn't use on A Curious Feeling, and put these two together. We made it much more rocky, both bits became much more rocky, my bit was a bit more epic, and Mike's bit was a bit slower and a bit more heavy-metal. And then Phil gave it a much more straightforward drum part perhaps neither of us would ever thought that we would want that on that bit [...] We put on one or two other bits, too, that ended up from there\". The video for the song appeared on MTV's first day of broadcast. \"Turn It On Again\" has been a favourite in Genesis's live shows. Consequently, the group's 1999 compilation album Turn It On Again: The Hits (as was its 2007 expanded reissue, subtitled The Tour Edition) was named after it, as was the band's 2007 Turn It On Again: The Tour reunion tour. On their tours in the 1980s, the band would attach a medley of 1960's pop songs (referred to by the band as the \"Blues Brothers\" medley, as the first song was \"Everybody Needs Somebody to Love\"); the song would be returned to its album form for the We Can't Dance tour and the band would later regard the medley as a poor decision.[citation needed]"@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"Through the Rain\" is a song by American singer Mariah Carey, taken from her ninth studio album, Charmbracelet (2002). It was written by Carey and Lionel Cole, and produced by the former and Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis. The song was released as the album's lead single on October 17, 2002, and a shorter version was used as the ending credits theme for a 2002 drama known as You're Under Arrest. Classified by Carey as a ballad, it is influenced by pop and R&B music genres, and features a simple and under-stated piano melody, backed by soft electronic synthesizers. \"Through the Rain\" was meant to be an insight into Carey personal struggles throughout 2001, and lyrically talks about encouraging others. The song has been well-received, with many complimenting its inspirational lyrical content, and described it as an open window into Carey's personal life for listeners. Commercially it was Carey's lowest charting lead single to date on the US Billboard Hot 100, and her first lead single to that point to not reach the top ten in the United States. Though stalling at number 81, it managed to achieve higher placements in international markets, reaching the top in Spain and peaking within the top ten in Canada, the Netherlands, Italy, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. Carey performed \"Through the Rain\" live on several television and award show appearances around the world. She debuted the song at the 2002 NRJ Awards, and features it on a one-hour special titled Mariah Carey: Shining Through the Rain, which aired three days later on MTV. In the United States, Carey performed the song on Today, The Oprah Winfrey Show, and American Music Awards of 2003s. Throughout Europe, Carey performed the song on The Graham Norton Show and on talent competition, Fame Academy. Additionally, \"Through the Rain\" was included on the set-list of Carey's Charmbracelet World Tour: An Intimate Evening with Mariah Carey, which spanned throughout 2003\u201304. The music video, directed by Dave Meyers, was set in the late 1960s. It features a past and present story-line based on Carey's childhood, and stars J. D. Williams and Jamie-Lynn Sigler as the singer's parents. The video begins with past scenes of Carey's mother being disowned by her family after becoming romantically involved with a black man, and finds the singer in the present walking through a heavy rainstorm in New York. The song was covered on live television by Filipino singers Regine Velasquez and Charice Pempengco."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"Runaway Child, Running Wild\" (shown as \"Run Away Child, Running Wild\" on the label of the original single) is a 1969 hit single for the Gordy (Motown) label, performed by The Temptations and produced by Norman Whitfield. The single was both the second from their landmark Cloud Nine LP, and the second of their \"psychedelic soul\" tracks penned by Whitfield and former Motown artist Barrett Strong. Featuring all five Temptations - Dennis Edwards, Eddie Kendricks, Paul Williams, Melvin Franklin, and Otis Williams - trading verses and harmony lines, \"Runaway Child, Running Wild\" paints a tale of a young boy (presumably a preteen) who runs away from home after being punished for playing hooky. The boy wanders the dark streets alone, eventually realizing he cannot survive on his own, but cannot find his way home, and ends up lost, frightened by strangers, unfamiliar landmarks, and his own thoughts. \"Runaway child runnin' wild,\" the Temptations tell the boy during the chorus, \"you better go back home/where you belong\". The Temptations alternately express and depict his fears, with the tension of the record building to a climax over the first five minutes of the record. At this point, the vocals fade out, and the record briefly gives voice to its young protagonist, who cries desperately for his mother before fading into the mix. \"Runaway Child\" then segues into an extended instrumental passage, during which Earl Van Dyke's organ, Joe Messina's electric guitar, and Dennis Coffey's distorted wah-wah pedal guitar take center stage for four minutes. After the instrumental builds the song up to a second climax, the track is stripped to a bassline and repeating hi-hat figure, and The Temptations return to the mix to issue one final admonition to the runaway: \"Listen to your heart beat/it's beating much too fast/go back home/where you belong\". The single version of \"Runaway Child\" only features the first five minutes of the song, fading out before the instrumental section begins. \"Runaway Child, Running Wild\" is often cited as one of the best songs on the subject of runaways, and Temptation Otis Williams often hears from fans that the record's terrifying depiction of running away kept them from doing so as children. The single peaked at number one on the Billboard Hot Rhythm & Blues Singles, and reached #6 on the Billboard Pop Singles chart. Earl Van Dyke, who performs the prominent organ solo during the instrumental section of the record, recorded his own instrumental version of \"Runaway Child, Running Wild\", which was released as a single the same year."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"Son of a Preacher Man\" is a song recorded by Dusty Springfield in September 1968 and featured on the album Dusty in Memphis. It was written by John Hurley and Ronnie Wilkins.

It was only upon hearing Springfield's version, a UK and American hit in 1969, that Aretha Franklin reconsidered and recorded the song herself including it on her 1970 album, This Girl's in Love with You, and it charted only as a less popular a-side of the b-side hit single \"Call Me\". Springfield's version was produced by Jerry Wexler, Tom Dowd and Arif Mardin for her first album for the Atlantic Records label and became an international hit reaching No.10 in the United States and No.9 in her native UK when released in late 1968. The album Dusty in Memphis was released in stereo though its singles were remixed and released in mono. \"Son of a Preacher Man\" was to be the last Top Ten chart hit for the artist for almost 20 years until she teamed up with Pet Shop Boys for the single \"What Have I Done to Deserve This?\" in 1987."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"The Simpsons Theme\", also referred to as \"The Simpsons Main Title Theme\" in album releases, is the theme music of the animated television series The Simpsons. It plays during the opening sequence and was composed by Danny Elfman in 1989, after series creator Matt Groening approached him requesting a retro-style theme. The piece, which took 3 days, 2 hours, 48 minutes, and 19 seconds to create, has been noted by Elfman as the most popular of his career. The theme, as used for the opening sequence, was re-arranged during season 2, and the current arrangement by Alf Clausen was introduced at the beginning of the third season. It has also been edited many times to coincide with edits of various lengths for the opening sequence, and there have been extended edits and re-recordings for lengthened opening sequences. Several versions of the saxophone solo riff, ostensibly played by character Lisa Simpson in the animated sequence, have been created over the course of the series. The theme is in the acoustic scale. A slightly different arrangement of the theme usually plays over the end credits of the show. Originally, there were two main versions of the closing theme, with the longer version ending in a lower key. Both versions were re-arranged for season 3, but only the short version was in use by the time the show switched domestic production from Klasky Csupo to Film Roman season 4, and that version was edited to be even shorter by the end of season 6. The alternate longer closing theme however resurfaced in a handful of post-season 4 episodes, but mostly in credit sequences that do not play music during the first half of the sequence (either with dialogue heard underneath or video footage playing under the first half of the credits)."@en ;

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ain\u0027t_That_a_Shame>	rdf:type	dbo:MusicalWork ;
	dbo:abstract	"\"Ain't That a Shame\" is a song written by Fats Domino and Dave Bartholomew. Released by Imperial Records in 1955, the song was a hit for Domino, eventually selling a million copies. It reached #1 on the \"Black Singles\" chart and #10 on the \"Pop Singles\" chart. The song is ranked #438 on the Rolling Stone magazine's list of The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time. The song gained national fame after being re-recorded by white recording artist Pat Boone. Domino's version soon became more popular, bringing Domino's music to the mass market a half dozen years after his first major recording, \"The Fat Man\". After \"Ain't That a Shame\", mainstream artists began covering Domino's songs. Teresa Brewer, for instance, performed the Domino rewrite of a folk song called \"Bo Weevil\". The Four Seasons version hit #22 on the Billboard charts in 1963. According to legend, Pat Boone suggested the title and lyrics be altered to \"Isn't That A Shame\" to make it more appealing to a broader audience but was dissuaded by his producers. Despite his suggestion being rejected, Boone had his first Billboard number-one single in 1955. Domino complimented Boone's cover of the song. Boone likes to tell the story about a Fats Domino concert and Domino invited Boone on stage. Domino showed a big gold ring and said \"Pat Boone bought me this ring.\" This was the first song that John Lennon learned to play. He later covered it on Rock 'n' Roll."@en ;

It was the band's first entry on the Billboard Hot 100, and appears on the albums Born on a Pirate Ship, Rock Spectacle and Disc One: All Their Greatest Hits. The music video for the song which garnered a Best Director nomination at the 1997 MuchMusic Video Awards, was directed by fellow Canadian and fan Jason Priestley at his own suggestion. Steven Page has said that the song was partly inspired by \"Back to the Old House\" by The Smiths.[citation needed] While some[weasel words] have misinterpreted the lyrics to mean that the man in the song is stalking an ex-girlfriend and breaks into her apartment to terrorize her, Page has said that this is definitely not the case.[citation needed] The person in the song and his girlfriend are still together and happy, having \"bought an old house on the Danforth\" (Danforth Avenue in Toronto). However, he goes back to visit \"the old apartment\" \"where we used to live,\" and winds up breaking in to reminisce. Although recalling \"broken glass,\" the \"crooked landing, crooked landlord,\" and other disadvantages, he nonetheless feels nostalgia for \"fading memories / blending into dull tableaux.\" The song, thanks in part to its video, which Priestley strongly supported and urged American networks to play, drew a notable level of attention in the U.S.[citation needed] Priestley also invited the band to play the song at the fictional night club, \"The Peach Pit After Dark\" on his series Beverly Hills, 90210. With some isolated exceptions, this was the band's first break into the American market, which continued with their next release, a live version of \"Brian Wilson\" from the ceritfied-gold album Rock Spectacle.[citation needed] The live version of \"The Old Apartment\" from that album was included on later American radio singles as a B-side option for stations.[citation needed] The studio version of the song has two main versions: the original album version and a radio mix, which was a completely new mix of the song. Notable differences in the radio mix, besides a completely new audio mix, include an 8-bar instrumental intro and in Page's noticeably filtered vocal bridge. Apple Inc. included the music video on the Mac OS 8 installation CD as a QuickTime example. Then-new band member Kevin Hearn was, as with \"Shoe Box,\" in the music video for this song even though he was not involved in the recording of the song.[citation needed] He plays an electric guitar, while Steven Page (who both played guitar and sang on the original) does not have a guitar in the video."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"Thieves in the Temple\" is a song by American musician Prince from the 1990 soundtrack album, Graffiti Bridge. Added at the last minute, it was the final song recorded for the album. \"Thieves in the Temple\" topped the US R&B chart and became a number six hit in the US, and a number seven hit in the UK. The single also peaked at number 9 on the dance charts. The track has a unique sound, starting quietly with echoed keyboards and vocals before the main section of the song booms in with a pulsating synth bass, syncopated drum machines, Middle Eastern melodies and opera-like layered vocals. Prince also samples a harmonica solo from a recording by The Chambers Brothers. The vocals are emotional, and accuse the subject of rejecting Prince and lying to him. The \"temple\" in the title recalls the ever-present spirituality in many of Prince's songs.

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pearl\u0027s_a_Singer>	rdf:type	dbo:MusicalWork ;
	dbo:abstract	"\"Pearl's a Singer\" is a song made famous by the British singer Elkie Brooks, as taken from her 1977 album Two Days Away which was produced by the song's co-writers Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller. The original version of \"Pearl's a Singer\" had been introduced by the duo Dino and Sembello - also the song's co-writers - on their 1974 self-titled album which Leiber and Stoller had produced. The song is a ballad, telling the story of a failed singer who still dreams of the success she might have had. \"Pearl's a Singer\" afforded Elkie Brooks her debut chart single - thirteen years after she'd recorded her first track - reaching #8 in the UK Singles Chart in spring 1977. It remained her highest placing in that chart until \"No More the Fool\" reached #5, early in 1987. Brooks would recall that at a rehearsal session for her Two Days Away album \"Jerry Leiber [said]: 'I want to play you this song, I don't think you're going to like it, it's too countryish for you but I'll play it for you anyway.'I said: 'Go on, I've got an open mind, I like a lot of country [music].' I listened to 'Pearl's a Singer' and told [Leiber & Stoller] I liked it but that they needed to [modify it with] a middle section. To which Jerry said: 'No problem'. And with that he disappeared and came back half an hour later with the [modified] version of 'Pearl's a Singer'\" which Brooks recorded. Brooks - \"To be honest [in the mid-1970s] I just wanted to enjoy myself in music and I never thought 'Pearl' was going to be a big hit but [after] it was released on my birthday in 1977 the record company really pushed it, [it] got played on all the radio stations and became very successful. No one was more surprised than me.\" \"Pearl's a Singer\" has also been recorded by Bernadette Peters (album Bernadette/ 1980), by Viktor Lazlo (album My Delicious Poisons/ 1991), and by Annie Schilder (nl) (album Anny En Ik/ 2007). The Czech rendering \"\u010Cern\u00FD Zp\u011Bv\u00E1k\" was recorded by Jana Kratochv\u00EDlov\u00E1 (cs) in 1978; the German rendering \"Tingel-Tangel \" was recorded by Wencke Myhre for her 1979 album So bin ich; the Swiss German rendering \"Pearl tuet singe\" was recorded by Toni Vescoli (als) for his 1999 album Tegsass. \"Pearl's a Singer\" is featured in the score of the Leiber & Stoller musical revue Smokey Joe's Cafe. Richard Digance parodied the song as \"Earl's a winger\", about an inept footballer."@en ;

It's quite funny, because we did this gig in Los Angeles and Frankie Knuckles played this track at the party afterwards. Neil came over and said, 'Why don't we make records like this?' I said, 'Neil, it is us.' So that's how much we know about dance music!\" The video was directed by Eric Watson and filmed in Newcastle and North Tyneside. Filming locations included the Bigg Market, Newcastle Quayside, Railway Terrace in Wallsend, Byker, Whitley Bay and the Tyne and Wear Metro. The black and white video co-stars Paul Gascoigne's sister Anna Gascoigne. The single's B-side was \"It Must Be Obvious\", with the USA release also featuring the remix of \"Paninaro\", which was originally released on Disco.

Before 2007, the song never charted in America. It then peaked at #36 on the Modern Rock Tracks, due to an EP being released by Warner Bros.

	dbo:abstract	"\"Bombers\" is the second single by Tubeway Army, released in 1978. The song is in a somewhat more conventional rock style than their punk-oriented debut, \"That's Too Bad\", and features sound effects simulating air raid sirens, dive bombers, and machine gun fire. Like its predecessor, the single earned indifferent reviews and failed to chart. It is one of the few recordings in his career which Numan did not produce himself. Though their musical styles differ, the song's subject matter is generally seen as a thinly disguised rewrite of David Bowie's \"Five Years\", the opening track of The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars (1972). Both songs feature detached observations of urban panic caused by impending catastrophe. \"Bombers\" (which has nothing to do with another Bowie track of the same name) is sung from the perspective of both a witness on the ground (\"Look up, I hear the scream of sirens on the wall\") and the bomber pilot (\"And me I know just where you are, you see I'm a bomber man\"). The B-sides were \"Blue Eyes\", which harked back to the fast-paced punk style of \"That's Too Bad\", and \"O.D. Receiver\", a slower piece whose lyrics reflected a Burroughsian world of drug addiction. All tracks on the original vinyl single were credited to 'Valerian', the name that Numan (born Gary Webb) had chosen for himself prior to Tubeway Army's debut; these would be his last releases using that nom de plume; henceforward he would call himself Gary Numan. \"Bombers\" was also later released as a gatefold with the single \"That's Too Bad\""@en ;

It was written by Carey, Justin Smith, Norman Whitfield and Cameron Giles, and produced by the former and Just Blaze. The song was released as the album's second single on November 26, 2002. Initially, \"The One\" had been chosen as the second single from the album, however, halfway through the filming of a music video for it, the singer decided to release \"Boy (I Need You)\" instead. Considered by Carey as one of her favorites, the track is a reworked version of rapper Cam'ron's song \"Oh Boy\" released earlier that year. The song was met with generally mixed reviews from contemporary critics. Many praised Carey's versatility and considered it as one of the stand-out tracks of Charmbracelet for having a different production when compared to the others. However, the sample hook of the song was described as \"annoying\". The single failed to make much impact on the charts around the world; it reached number 68 on the US Billboard Hip-Hop/R&B Songs chart and number 57 on the US Hot Singles Sales chart. Elsewhere, the song reached the top 20 in the United Kingdom, while peaking within the top 40 in Australia, the Netherlands, Ireland and New Zealand. The music video, directed by Joseph Kahn, incorporates elements of Japanese culture and features Carey's alter-ego Bianca. It was also the first time that Carey worked with Kahn in a music video, which premiered on an episode of MTV's Making the Video in 2003. Following the release of \"Through the Rain\", Carey embarked on several stateside, European and Asian promotional tours in support of Charmbracelet, as well as its accompanying singles.

The new version also served as the second single from the soundtrack of Austin Powers in Goldmember. \"Boys\" is a R&B and hip hop song, including funk influences. The remix carries a slower tempo than the album version, and both versions are noted to be reminiscent of Janet Jackson. Some critics praised Williams and Spears' chemistry, as well as the production on the track, while others did not think the song worked well.

Eriksen, Tor Erik Hermansen and Johnt\u00E1 Austin, and produced by the former three. It was released as the album's second single on April 15, 2008. The song is influenced by pop and R&B music genres, and features a piano and keyboard-driven melody. Lyrically, the song is a dialogue in between Carey and her deceased father throughout the verses, and a universal salute to departed loved ones on the chorus. The song received generally positive reviews, with many critics considering it a highlight from the album. Though expected by critics to have surely become Carey's 19th chart-topping single in the United States, following the success of \"Touch My Body\", the track only managed to reach a peak position of number 19 on the Billboard Hot 100. In the other countries the song achieved relatively weak charting, peaking within the top ten in New Zealand, and the top-fifty in Canada, Ireland, Slovakia, and the United Kingdom. \"Bye Bye\" was performed on few live televised appearances, in comparison to the large promotional boost given to \"Touch My Body\". Carey first performed the song on T4, followed by Good Morning America and The Oprah Winfrey Show. Carey performed \"Bye Bye\" for the final time on the seventh season of American Idol, where she was featured as a mentor for the top-seven week.

	dbo:abstract	"\"Come On Over Baby (All I Want Is You)\" is a song by American singer Christina Aguilera, taken from her debut studio album Christina Aguilera. It was released on September 26, 2000 by RCA Records as the fourth and final single from the album, and was the first where she was given significant creative control. The song was written by Johan Aberg, Paul Rein, Christina Aguilera, Ron Fair, C. Blackmon, R. Cham, E. Dawkins, Shelly Peiken, and Guy Roche; a re-recorded version included a rapped verse written by Aguilera. Lyrically, it sees Aguilera eyeing a prospective boyfriend. Upon its release, \"Come on Over Baby (All I Want Is You)\" achieved international commercial success. It became Aguilera's third single to peak at number one on the US Billboard Hot 100, also reaching the top ten of countries including Australia and the United Kingdom. The song's accompanying music video saw Aguilera experiment with her styling, beginning an evolution of image reinventions seen in the ensuing years of her career. Later in 2000, a Spanish-language version of the song was adapted by Rudy P\u00E9rez titled \"Ven Conmigo (Solamente T\u00FA)\" which was recorded for Aguilera's second studio album Mi Reflejo. \"Ven Conmigo (Solamente T\u00FA)\" was released on August 8, 2000 to Latin radio stations in the United States. The song was featured in the videogame Dead or Alive Xtreme Beach Volleyball."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"Complex\" is a song by British musician Gary Numan. It was the second single to be taken from his 1979 album The Pleasure Principle. The single reached number six in the UK Singles Chart. The recording's backing track uses conventional acoustic drums, acoustic piano, and electric bass guitar, however the distinctive lead parts are performed on violin, viola, and heavily flanged and reverberated analogue monosynth, an unusual combination in popular music. Lyrically, the song alludes to a psychological complex, expressing a paranoia that might have been directed at critics, fans, stalkers or false friends, depending on one's point of view: A BBC Radio 1 review panel speculated that this song was \"the first electronic ballad\", although this is untrue, as it post-dates recordings such as \"Hiroshima Mon Amour\" by Ultravox and \"Neon Lights\" by Kraftwerk by a couple of years. Numan rarely performed \"Complex\" in concert throughout the '80s and '90s, with versions appearing on the recently re-released and expanded 1980 recordings captured on Living Ornaments '80, as well as the Micromusic video from his final Wembley Arena concert in 1981 and its CD counterpart Living Ornaments '81. He revived the song on stage in September 2003, as captured in the \"Hope Bleeds\" DVD and CD."@en ;

It made #48 in mid August of the same year, giving Feeder their first top 50 hit despite the band still yet to appear on Radio 1's playlist at the time. The song refers to a relationship. The b-side \"Here In The Bubble\" was a working title for the \"Polythene\" album, which leads to many fans wondering if this track would have been on the album had the original title of the same name stayed. Also on the single is an acoustic version of the album track \"Forgive\". Kerrang! referred to the song as \"one of the finest slices of pop-coated rock you could ever wish to hear\", and rated the single \"KKKK\" (four stars out of five), further noting that the full single was another of \"Grant Nicholas' big-booted, gorgeously bruised stompers\" and commented \"one wonders what you have to do to get played on Radio 1 these days\". HMV promoted the single with a press advertisement in Kerrang! on 16 August 1997. Nonetheless, by the time of the advertisement, HMV had banned Feeder from playing live in their stores after hundreds of fans crowd surfed during the song when the band performed the song during a brief set at the Portsmouth HMV branch on 11 August, which was the second performance of their HMV brief acoustic set tour to promote the single which had began earlier that day in Southampton. As Kerrang! reported, more than three-hundred fans came to see the band perform the song, but as the record store bosses were unpleased with the crowd surfing, and when the band travelled to the Bristol HMV the following day as their next in their promotional tour, they were told they could sign autographs but not perform live at any HMV branch again."@en ;

Influenced by the recent events off the September 11 attacks in New York City and Washington D.C. in North America, Hamasaki sought a new inspiration for her then-forthcoming album; instead off writing songs about confusion, loneliness and love like her previous efforts, she was encouraged to engage in more peaceful and worldly themes. This resulted into several songs on I Am..., including \"Daybreak\". Musically, there are two versions; the album version which is influenced by pop rock and Americanized alternative rock music, while the single version utilizes synthpop, trip hop and dark ambient music. The lyrical content talks about achievement and self-empowerment. Upon the release, \"Daybreak\" received mixed to favorable reviews from most music critics, who had praised Hamasaki's vocal abilities and likened the production, while critics were divided with the single version and lack of innovation. An accompanying music video was shot by Wataru Takeishi for the single version, which featured Hamasaki walking on deserted highway in early hours off the morning. Commercially, \"Daybreak\" had fair charting response in her native Japan. The song debuted at number two on both Daily and Weekly Oricon chart, becoming her first single to miss the top spot since \"Audience\". Although certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of Japan (RIAJ), it remained her last single to not peak at number one for over a decade until it was surpassed by her 2013 recording \"Feel the Love/Merry-Go-Round\" at number five.

The song originated from Saturday Night Live executive producer Lorne Michaels, who asked Samberg to write a track to showcase Timberlake's singing abilities. \"Dick in a Box\" was recorded in one night while its music video filmed the following day. After being screened by NBC executives for content, the short debuted less than a few hours later. In its original network airing, the word \"dick\", a recurring word in the chorus, was bleeped 16 times. Saturday Night Live producers made the decision to publish the uncensored version of the short online after its broadcast debut under the titles \u201CSpecial Treat in a Box\u201D or \u201CSpecial Christmas Box\u201D. Like its predecessor, \"Lazy Sunday\", \"Dick in a Box\" became a major viral hit on the Internet. It received a very favorable audience and critical reception.

Written by Steve Harris, the band's bass player and primary songwriter, it serves as the title track to Iron Maiden's 1992 album Fear of the Dark. The single \"Fear of the Dark (live)\" is the 26th single released by the band. This live version of the song (as well as the live versions of \"Bring Your Daughter... to the Slaughter\", \"Be Quick or Be Dead\", and \"Tailgunner\") are taken from the live album A Real Live One. The single reached number 8 in the UK charts. The live version of \"Hooks in You\" was recorded at the Wembley Arena, London, UK on 17 December 1990. The initial pressing of the 7\" cut-to-shape vinyl picture disc listed Hooks In You (live) as the B-side but actually played Tailgunner (live). This mis-press was quickly corrected by EMI on future pressings. The song has been covered by German a cappella metal band van Canto on their album Hero, as well as the Italian metal band Graveworm on their 2001 album Scourge of Malice, by the also Italian death metal band Infernal Poetry on their 2005 album Beholding the Unpure and by the Finnish band Sturm und Drang as the bonus track on their 2008 album Rock 'n Roll Children. The song was covered by Fightstar for Kerrang! magazine's Maiden Heaven tribute album. The Flight 666 version of the song was released as downloadable content for the Rock Band video game series on 9 June 2009. \"Fear of the Dark\" was nominated for a Grammy Award in 1994 in the \"Best Metal Performance\" category, but lost to \"I Don't Want To Change The World\" by Ozzy Osbourne. When the song is performed live, the audience always sings along to the melody during the soft (and sometimes the heavy) sections, at times becoming louder than the band themselves.

The song was written by Beyonc\u00E9, Sean Garrett, and Pharrell for Beyonc\u00E9's second solo studio album, B'Day (2006). Produced by The Neptunes, it was released as the fifth UK and seventh overall single on July 30, 2007 through Columbia Records. \"Green Light\" is an R&B-funk song with lyrics detailing a break-up song in which the female protagonist gives her love interest the permission to move out. The song also finds Beyonc\u00E9 using fairly aggressive tone. Written in the key of A minor, \"Green Light\" samples the \"uh-oh-oh-oh-oh\" vocals which music critics noted to have a flagrant resemblance to Beyonc\u00E9's own 2003 hit single, \"Crazy in Love\". A remix of the song features American rapper Young Buck. \"Green Light\" was generally well received by music critics who universally praised the beat, bass, groove, and angry tone used by Beyonc\u00E9 in the song. The single performed moderately on charts, peaking at number 12 on the UK Singles Chart and at number 46 in Ireland. The Freemasons remix of the track peaked at number eighteen on the Dutch Top 40 chart. The single's accompanying music video was directed by Melina Matsoukas and co-directed by Beyonc\u00E9. It is inspired by Robert Palmer's 1985 music video \"Addicted to Love\". Beyonc\u00E9 considered the video, which is her second to feature her all-female tour band called the Suga Mama, her toughest shoot. The song was a part of the set list on her world tour The Beyonc\u00E9 Experience (2007)."@en ;

The song features vocals from American rapper Andr\u00E9 3000. \"Green Light\" shows a shift in musical style for Legend, opting for a funk and electro sound composed of electronic synths and fast, synthesized beats. The song also features the use of several horn instruments, including the saxophone, trombone and trumpet. \"Green Light\" was well received by contemporary music critics who praised it for the departure in musical style and called it a \"certified club banger\". The single performed well on the charts, reaching number twenty-four on the Billboard Hot 100, tying for \"Ordinary People\" as Legend's highest peaking single on the chart at the time. It also stands as his best selling single, earning a platinum certification by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) until \"All of Me\" sold 4 million downloads by September 2014.

The song is not related to the popular birthday song \"Happy Birthday to You\". The first album it appeared on was The Birthday Party. It was later included as track two on the 1992 compilation Hits. The release of the single was part of the band's rebranding of themselves as The Birthday Party before their relocation to London. It is notable for several reasons. The mundanity of the song's lyrical subject matter, an eleven-year-old boy's birthday party, contrasts strongly to the discordance of the music. The song is also an excellent showcase for the sub-vocalisations that marked Nick Cave's early singing style, including grunts, wordless shrieks and on two separate occasions an impersonation of a barking dog. The song also displays the band's innovative use of two lead guitarists playing two separate riffs.[citation needed]"@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"Heartbreaker\" is a song by American singer-songwriter Mariah Carey. It was released on September 21, 1999 by Columbia Records as the lead single from Carey's seventh studio album, Rainbow (1999). The song was written by Carey and Jay-Z and produced by the former and DJ Clue. Additional writers are credited, since the song's hook is built around a sample from \"Attack of the Name Game\" by Stacy Lattisaw. \"Heartbreaker\" pushed Carey even further into the R&B and hip-hop market, becoming her first commercial single to feature a hip-hop artist. Lyrically, the song talks about a relationship from the female perspective, and how the protagonist incessantly returns to her lover, even though he continuously cheats on her and breaks her heart. The song received mixed reviews from music critics, many of which felt it was not original or innovative in terms of a creative step forward. Additionally, it was compared heavily to Carey's previous song \"Fantasy\" (1995), which also built its hook from a sampled beat. \"Heartbreaker\" topped the charts in Canada and US Billboard Hot 100, becoming Carey's 14th chart topper there. Across Europe and Australia, the song topped the charts in New Zealand, and was a top five single in France and the United Kingdom. Carey performed \"Heartbreaker\" live on several television and award show appearances around the world, as well as on her concert tours. The song's music video, directed by Brett Ratner, is one of the most expensive ever made, costing over $2.5 million. The video features Carey and her friends visiting a film theater and catching her boyfriend (played by Jerry O'Connell) on a date with another woman. Carey played herself and a brunette villainess named Bianca, during a physical altercation scene in between the two women. Due to contractual agreements at the time of its filming, Jay-Z was unable to make an appearance in the video, instead being portrayed as an animated cartoon. The video was inspired by several films including Grease and Enter the Dragon."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"Hero\" is a song by American singer-songwriter Mariah Carey. It was released on October 19, 1993 via Columbia Records as the second single from Carey's third studio album, Music Box (1993). Originally intended for Gloria Estefan, the song was written and produced by Carey and Walter Afanasieff. While writing the song, Carey did not connect to its style or sound, therefore forfeiting it over to the soundtrack of the film of the same name. However, after being convinced to keep it, she personalized it, giving it a more pop and R&B melody,[citation needed] as well as changing some of the lyrics to more precisely fit her personality. Lyrically, the song is regarded as one of Carey's most inspirational and personal ballads, with its protagonist declaring that even though we may feel discouraged or down at times, in reality we are \"heroes\" if we look inside ourselves and see our own inner strength; in time, it will help us \"find the way.\" The song received mixed reviews by contemporary music critics for its lyrical content, while Carey's vocal performance was praised. Aside from its lyrics, \"Hero\" derived its hook and sound from several musical instruments such as the guitar, piano and organ. The song experienced strong success in several international markets, and also became Carey's eighth chart topper on the Billboard Hot 100. Additionally, it was ranked number 53 on the Decade-End Chart. Outside the United States, \"Hero\" enjoyed strong charting, reaching the top five in Canada, France, Ireland, New Zealand and Norway and the top ten in Australia and the United Kingdom. Due to fan requests and letters, as well as their connection to its personal meaning and content, the song remains one of Carey's most performed songs. Deemed by many as her signature song, the song was originally performed on The Arsenio Hall Show, The Tonight Show with Jay Leno, and Hey Hey It's Saturday during its original chart run. Additionally, Carey performed it on several live telethons and specials, such as Pavarotti and Friends and Michael Jackson & Friends in 1999, America: A Tribute to Heroes in 2001, Live 8 in 2005, and the inaugural ball for Barack Obama in 2009. Additionally, the song was featured on the set-lists of all of Carey's tours, usually serving as the encore or closing number, and making its debut during the album's accompanying set of concerts, the Music Box Tour. The song was included on several of Carey's compilation albums, #1's (1998), Greatest Hits (2001), The Ballads (2008), and #1 to Infinity (2015). Throughout the course of her career, Carey has re-recorded the song twice, and filmed other music videos aside from the original. The first music video for the song was filmed by Larry Jordan in July 1993 during a private concert at Proctor's Theatre, later released on the home video Here Is Mariah Carey. In 2001, following the September 11 attacks, Carey re-recorded the song as a mash-up single titled \"Never Too Far/Hero Medley,\" a medley with her single at the time, \"Never Too Far.\" Additionally, prior to the release of her compilation album The Ballads, Carey re-recorded \"Hero\" and filmed a new video featuring behind the scenes footage of the studio. \"Hero\" won two ASCAP Rhythm & Soul Music Awards, one ASCAP Pop Music Award and one BMI Pop Award for the Songwriter Award. The song has been covered many times during both studio and live recordings, such as on global singing competitions."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"Holy Wars... The Punishment Due\" is the opening track of thrash metal band Megadeth's 1990 album Rust in Peace. The song has an unusual structure, shifting at 2:26 after an acoustic bridge by Marty Friedman to a different, slower and heavier section called \"The Punishment Due\", before speeding up again. The entire song is commonly referred to as \"Holy Wars\". The lyrics deal with the Northern Ireland conflict. In an interview with the UK magazine Guitarist, Mustaine says that he was inspired to write the song in Northern Ireland, when he discovered bootlegged Megadeth T-shirts were on sale and was dissuaded from taking action to have them removed on the basis that they were part of fund raising activities for \"The Cause\" (i.e. the Provisional Irish Republican Army). \"The Punishment Due\" is based on the popular Marvel comic book character, the Punisher. A cover version of the song is playable in the band simulation game Rock Revolution. The master recording is purchasable as part of the Rust in Peace album pack on the Rock Band band simulation platform, is playable in the Guitar Hero: Warriors of Rock game, and is available as DLC for Rocksmith 2014. The \"Holy Wars... The Punishment Due\" video was filmed in August 1990 (around the time of the Gulf War in 1990). It depicts news footage of various armed conflicts, mainly from the Middle East."@en ;

It was released as a single on 1 November 1976, as the follow-up to \"Dancing Queen\" (both from the album Arrival). The B-side, \"Crazy World\", was recorded in 1974 during the sessions for the album ABBA. The song (originally titled \"Been and Gone and Done It\") is sung from the viewpoint of a woman who, despite hard work, can barely keep her finances in surplus, and therefore desires a well-off man. ABBA perform parts of \"Money, Money, Money\" live in the 1977 film ABBA: The Movie. In the popular musical, Mamma Mia!, the song is sung by the character of Donna as she explains how hard she has to work to keep the taverna in order and her dreams of a better life. In the 2008 film, Meryl Streep sings the song."@en ;

The video was shot over a period of two days in November 2003 at the Sunset Tower, a hotel in Los Angeles, California. It was directed by Asia Argento, who guest stars in the video along with Eric Szmanda & former band member Gidget Gein whose \"In Case of Emergency Break Heart\" sculpture is featured in the video. The sculpture is an edition of three,the one in the video being owned by Asia Argento and the other is owned by artist and friend of Gidget Gein, Damian Crowley and the third version is owned by UnPOP art movement co-founder and friend Aaron Partridge. Along with the release of the album, Lest We Forget, Manson released a single DVD with the uncut, banned from the label, original version of the music video. The only way to receive this though was to order it through Manson's website. It came also with the CD/DVD package. The explicit version of the DVD was released with the (s)AINT video in Australia and Europe. Japan required an edited version of the video due to censorship laws on showing female genitalia in media."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"Shangri-La\" is a song written by Ray Davies of The Kinks. The song appeared on the 1969 concept album, Arthur (Or the Decline and Fall of the British Empire). The song's inspiration can be traced back to when the band visited the Davies brothers' sister, Rose, and her family in Australia, the \"designed community\" that the family lived in serving as the initial lyrical inspiration. The song's highly ironic lyrics comment on British class society while portraying Arthur, the album's ill-fated protagonist, and his empty life in the suburbs. The musical aspects of the song both reflect and comment on the mood of the lyrics. \"Shangri-La\" was released as the second single from Arthur in the United Kingdom, backed with \"This Man He Weeps Tonight.\" The single was a commercial failure, not reaching the charts in any countries besides the Netherlands. The members of the band, however, thought highly of the song, with both Dave Davies and John Dalton singling it out for praise."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"Sheena Is a Parasite\" was the debut single by the UK band The Horrors, released in April 2006. It did not chart, as it contained both stickers and inserts, therefore breaking chart rules. The title and content were adapted from The Ramones single \"Sheena Is a Punk Rocker\" as well as The Cramps' \"Sheena's in a Goth Gang\", and chronicled the demise of punk music and its cultural influence. The music video was directed by Chris Cunningham, ending a seven-year music video hiatus for the much respected Cunningham, who admitted to being \"mildly obsessed\" with the track after coming across it on MySpace. Following several Aphex Twin videos in Cunningham's filmography, the video was expected to be suitably twisted and quirky. The video starred Academy Award nominee Samantha Morton as the song's manic, transmogrifying subject who whipped around like a banshee and spewed her intestines at the camera. Sharply edited and shot on a low budget, the video was instantly banned from MTV UK purely on the basis of the use of strobe lights, not because of the gory subject matter (as was erroneously reported by the [NME]). Cunningham did not want to edit out the strobing as he felt it would compromise his work. The video did air on MTV2 in America. The B-side was a Screaming Lord Sutch cover, although this version was more inspired by the previous cover by The Gruesomes. In October 2011, NME placed \"Sheena Is a Parasite\" at No. 96 on its list \"150 Best Tracks of the Past 15 Years\"."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"Stripped\" is Depeche Mode's fifteenth UK single, released on 10 February 1986. It was the first single from the album Black Celebration, and the band's thirteenth overall and sixth consecutive single to hit the UK Top 20, peaking at number 15. \"Stripped\" is well known for its innovative use of sampling. The underlying beat is a distorted and slowed-down sound of a motorcycle engine running, while the main melody begins with a car's ignition starting, and the end uses sounds of fireworks. The band's U.S. label Sire Records, however, decided to use the B-side \"But Not Tonight\" on the soundtrack to the movie Modern Girls and included the song on US editions of Black Celebration. As a result, the single was flipped, and released as \"But Not Tonight\" in the United States to help promote the movie. The band was not happy with this decision, seeing \"But Not Tonight\" as a useless pop track recorded in less than a day. The single did not chart. Surprisingly, despite previous criticism of the song by the band, an acoustic version of \"But Not Tonight\" was sometimes performed by Martin Gore on Depeche Mode\u2019s Delta Machine Tour and is included in the 2014 album \"Live in Berlin\". The other two B-Sides are \"Breathing in Fumes\" and \"Black Day\". \"Breathing in Fumes\" was a new song using samples from \"Stripped\", mixed by the band and Thomas Stiehler. \"Black Day\" is an acoustic, alternate version of \"Black Celebration\" sung by Martin Gore, and is co-written by him, Alan Wilder, and producer Daniel Miller \u2013 the only Depeche Mode song where Miller receives a writing credit. The \"Highland Mix\" of \"Stripped\" was mixed by Mark Ellis (better known as Flood), who in the future would produce Depeche Mode's Violator and Songs of Faith and Devotion records. Some editions of the Black Celebration CD include the extended remix of \"But Not Tonight\" along with \"Black Day\" and \"Breathing in Fumes\" as bonus tracks. The music video for \"Stripped\" was the last Depeche Mode video to be directed by Peter Care and was filmed outside of Hansa Studios in Berlin. The music video for \"But Not Tonight\" was directed by Tamra Davis and is available in multiple versions. \"Stripped\" was featured in the film Say Anything...."@en ;

A last minute decision was made to switch the songs. \"Vow\" was relegated to bonus track on the CD single. \"Subhuman\" was released as the band's second single exclusively in the United Kingdom, and it gave Garbage their first chart appearance, peaking at #50 on the UK Singles Chart. The single was promoted by a press junket organised by the record label on a boat sailing down London's River Thames, and attracted media attention for the distinctive rubber packaging of the vinyl format. \"Subhuman\" was also used by the label as an opportunity to massively raise general awareness of Garbage and as an advertising campaign to brand the \"G\" logo by promoting the single release with plain white flyers, stickers, carrier bags, t-shirts and subway posters emblazoned with the band's \"G\" logo. \"Subhuman\" was never intended to be an album cut, and was not included on the standard editions of the band's debut album, Garbage which was released later that year.

	dbo:abstract	"\"Thriller\" is a song recorded by American singer Michael Jackson, composed by Rod Temperton, and produced by Quincy Jones. It is the seventh and final single released by Epic Records from his 1982 studio album Thriller. A 14-minute video showing Jackson in a Halloween-themed performance was first shown on December 2, 1983. The song was not released as a single until January 23, 1984. \"Thriller\" has appeared on multiple greatest hits compilation albums from Jackson, including \"HIStory\" (1995), \"Number Ones\" (2003), \"The Essential Michael Jackson\" (2005) and \"Michael Jackson's This Is It\" (2009) and was remixed for the \"Immortal\" album in 2011. The song has a voice-over from actor Vincent Price. In the song, sound effects such as a creaking door, thunder, feet walking on wooden planks, winds and howling dogs can be heard, and the lyrics contain frightening themes and elements. \"Thriller\" received positive reviews from critics and became Jackson's seventh top-ten single on the Billboard Hot 100 Chart from the album, while reaching the top of the charts in France and Belgium and the top ten in many other countries. \"Thriller\" was adapted by \"American Werewolf In London\" director John Landis into a highly successful music video, known independently as \"Michael Jackson's Thriller\". At fourteen minutes the video is substantially longer than the song, which ties together a narrative featuring Jackson and actress Ola Ray in a setting heavily inspired by horror films of the 1950s. In the video's most iconic scene, Jackson leads other actors costumed as zombies in a choreographed dance routine. Though it garnered some criticism for its occult theme and violent imagery, the video was immediately popular and received high critical acclaim, being nominated for six MTV Video Music Awards in 1984 and winning three. In 2009 it was added to the National Film Registry by the Library of Congress, the first music video ever selected."@en ;

In many countries, it was issued as the second single from the album, in February 1971, becoming a top-ten hit in the United States, Canada and elsewhere, and topping singles charts in Australia and Switzerland. In the United Kingdom, \"What Is Life\" appeared as the B-side to \"My Sweet Lord\", which was the best-selling single there of 1971. Harrison's backing musicians on the song include Eric Clapton and the entire Delaney & Bonnie Friends band, with whom he had toured during the final months of the Beatles. Harrison co-produced the recording with Phil Spector, whose Wall of Sound production also employed a prominent string arrangement by John Barham and multiple acoustic rhythm guitars, played by Harrison's fellow Apple Records signings Badfinger. An uptempo composition in the soul genre, \"What Is Life\" is one of several Harrison love songs that appear to be directed at both a woman and a deity. Harrison wrote the song in 1969 and originally intended it as a track for his friend and Apple prot\u00E9g\u00E9 Billy Preston to record. Built around a descending guitar riff, it is one of Harrison's most popular compositions and was a regular inclusion in his live performances. Rolling Stone magazine has variously described it as a \"classic\" and an \"exultant song of surrender\". \"What Is Life\" has appeared in the soundtrack for feature films such as Goodfellas (1990), Patch Adams (1998), Big Daddy (1999) and This Is 40 (2012). Harrison's original recording was included on the compilations The Best of George Harrison and Let It Roll, and live versions appear on his album Live in Japan (1992) and in Martin Scorsese's 2011 documentary George Harrison: Living in the Material World. In 1972, Olivia Newton-John had a UK hit with her version of the song. Ronnie Aldrich, the Ventures, the Four Freshmen and Shawn Mullins are among the other artists who have covered the track."@en ;

It is the opening track from their 1987 album The Joshua Tree and was released as the album's third single in August 1987. The song's hook is a repeating guitar arpeggio using a delay effect, played during the song's introduction and again at the end. Lead vocalist Bono wrote the lyrics in response to the notion that it is possible to identify a person's religion and income based on the street on which they lived, particularly in Belfast. During the band's difficulties recording the song, producer Brian Eno considered erasing the song's tapes to have them start from scratch. \"Where the Streets Have No Name\" was praised by critics and became a commercial success, peaking at number thirteen in the US, number fourteen in Canada, number ten in the Netherlands, and number four in the United Kingdom. The song has become one of the band's most popular songs and has remained a staple of their live act since the song debuted in 1987 on The Joshua Tree Tour. The song was notably performed on a Los Angeles rooftop for the filming of its music video, which won a Grammy Award for Best Performance Music Video. In February 2013, the song was used by the NFL's Baltimore Ravens as the team's entrance song in Super Bowl XLVII.

	dbo:abstract	"\"We Will Rock You\" is a song written by Brian May and recorded and performed by Queen for their 1977 album News of the World. Rolling Stone ranked it number 330 of \"The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time\" in 2004, and the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) placed it at number 146 on its list of Songs of the Century. In 2009, \"We Will Rock You\" was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame. Other than the last 30 seconds containing a guitar solo by May, the song is generally set in a cappella form, using only stomping and clapping as a rhythmic beat. In 1977, \"We Will Rock You\" and \"We Are the Champions\" were issued together as a worldwide top ten single. Soon after the album was released, many radio stations began playing the songs consecutively and without interruption. Since its release, \"We Will Rock You\" has been covered, remixed, sampled, parodied, referenced and used by multiple recording artists, TV shows, films and other media worldwide. Since its release, the song has become a cliche at sports events around the world as a stadium anthem, mostly due to its simple rhythm."@en ;

New versions of the song with simpler instrumentation were subsequently released by both the Beatles and McCartney.

	dbo:abstract	"\"Ironic\" is a song by Canadian-American singer Alanis Morissette. It was released in February 1996 as the third single from her third studio album, Jagged Little Pill (1995). It was written by Morissette and Glen Ballard, and was produced by him. Maverick. \"Ironic\" is a pop rock song written in the key of B major, and includes a moderate tempo of eighty-two beats per minute. The lyrics present several situations which are said to be \"ironic\", which has led to debates about whether any of them fit the accepted meaning of irony. The track topped the Canadian RPM Top Singles chart for six weeks, and reached the top five in Australia, New Zealand and Norway. In the United States, the song reached number four on April 13, 1996, and currently is her highest-charting single on the Billboard Hot 100. \"Ironic\" was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). The song won the Juno Award for Single of the Year, and received two Grammy Award nominations in 1997, for Record of the Year and Best Short Form Music Video. French director St\u00E9phane Sednaoui filmed the music video. In it, Morissette drives through a winter landscape, and she plays multiple roles as her passengers. MTV nominated the music video for six MTV Video Music Awards in 1996, winning three of them. The music video was listed on VH1's \"Greatest Music Videos\" list and was parodied by Allison Rheaume and \"Weird Al\" Yankovic. In 2004, Morissette changed the lyrics of \"Ironic\" to denote her support for same-sex marriage at the fifteenth GLAAD Media Awards. This version was included on her albums iTunes Originals (2004) and Jagged Little Pill Acoustic (2005), and was performed at the House of Blues in 2005, along with Canadian singer Avril Lavigne. \"Ironic\" was included on the set list of her tour Jagged Little Pill World Tour (1995), and her compilation albums MTV Unplugged (1999), The Collection (2005), among others.

dbr:Video_Killed_the_Radio_Star	rdf:type	dbo:MusicalWork ;
	dbo:abstract	"\"Video Killed the Radio Star\" is a song written by Trevor Horn, Geoff Downes and Bruce Woolley in 1978. It was first recorded by Bruce Woolley and The Camera Club (with Thomas Dolby on keyboards) for their album English Garden, and later by British group The Buggles, consisting of Horn and Downes. The track was recorded and mixed in 1979, released as their debut single on 7 September 1979 by Island Records, and included on their first album The Age of Plastic. The backing track was recorded at Virgin's Town House in West London, and mixing and vocal recording would later take place at Sarm East Studios. Like all the other tracks from the LP, \"Video\"'s theme was promotion of technology while worrying about its effects. This song relates to concerns about mixed attitudes towards 20th-century inventions and machines for the media arts. Musically, the song performs like an extended jingle and the composition plays in the key of D-flat major in common time at a tempo of 132 beats per minute. The track has been positively received, with reviewers praising its unusual musical pop elements. Although the song includes several common pop characteristics and six basic chords are used in its structure, Downes and writer Timothy Warner described the piece as musically complicated, due to its use of suspended and minor ninth chords for enhancement that gave the song a \"slightly different feel.\" Commercially, \"Video Killed the Radio Star\" was also a success. The track topped sixteen international music charts, including the official singles charts of the group's home country of the UK and other nations such as Australia, Austria, France, Italy, Ireland, Spain, Sweden and Switzerland, as well as the Japanese Oricon International Chart. It also peaked within the top 10 in Canada, Germany, New Zealand and South Africa, the top 20 in Belgium and the Netherlands, and barely in the top 40 in the United States. The song's music video was written, directed, and edited by Russell Mulcahy, and is well-remembered as the first music video shown on MTV in the United States at 12:01am on 1 August 1981, and the first video shown on MTV Classic in the United Kingdom on 1 March 2010. The song has received several critical accolades, such as being ranked number 40 on VH1's 100 Greatest One-Hit Wonders of the '80s. It has been covered by many recording artists. Trevor Horn has done performances of the song, both at Buggles reunion performances and with The Producers, since 1998."@en ;

Although it was released as the final Supremes song featuring Diana Ross, who left the group for a solo career in January 1970, it was recorded as Ross' first solo single and Supremes members Mary Wilson and Cindy Birdsong do not sing on the recording. Both appear on the B-side, \"He's My Sunny Boy.\" The single topped the Billboard Hot 100 pop singles chart for one week. Reaching number-one on the American pop chart in the final 1969 issue of Billboard magazine (dated December 27), the single was not only the final number-one in 12 chart-topping pop hits for The Supremes, but it also holds the distinction of being the final American number-one hit of the 1960s."@en ;

At the time, this was a record as the biggest such fall to ever occur in UK chart history, but it was then beaten five months later by Embrace with their single \"My Weakness is None of Your Business\" (which fell from #9 to #44 the following week). The duo were admirers of the sound of Motiv8,[citation needed] who had remixed various other artists at the time. Neil Tennant asked the man behind Motiv8 (Steve Rodway) to remix this single, even visiting Rodway at work in his studio during the remix.[citation needed] After it was finished and delivered, Tennant insisted that a synth line, which Rodway had come up with on the Motiv8 version, should be used on the Pet Shop Boys' own main mix. After unsuccessful attempts to recreate Rodway's riff, it eventually had to be sampled from the Motiv8 mix.[citation needed] Thus, as well as appearing on the Motiv8 remix, it appears on the Pet Shop Boys' main version."@en ;

The artistic attitude of \"All You Need Is Love\" epitomised that of The JAMs' subsequent recordings: making use of popular music by taking extensive samples of other artists' work, and juxtaposing these with each other, adding beatbox rhythms and Bill Drummond's Scottish-accented raps, poems and narrations.

It was written by Fergie and Toby Gad while the production was helmed by will.i.am. The song was released as the fourth single from the album on May 22, 2007. \"Big Girls Don't Cry\" deviates from the hip-hop and urban music of Fergie's previous singles and opts for a more simplistic pop sound that incorporates acoustic and classical elements. It features credits from about thirty instrumentalists, many of which play the violins, violas and celli on the track. It is one of the few songs on the album that does not sample any other songs. Lyrically, the song talks about moving on from the pain of divorce. The critical reception of \"Big Girls Don't Cry\" was positive, with many praising the maturity and simplicity displayed on the single as well as the message. The song was a commercial success domestically, attaining the top position on the Billboard Hot 100. It became her third single to do so and earned her the accolade of being the first female artist with three number one singles from one album since 2000 with Christina Aguilera's first three number one singles. \"Big Girls Don't Cry\" also became Fergie's highest selling single in the country with 3,833,000 units sold as of August 2012, and her longest charting with nearly fifty weeks logged on the Hot 100 between May 2007 and March 2008. The song peaked at number one in Canada and was present for fifty-three weeks on the chart. The song also reached number one in various international territories including Denmark, Ireland, New Zealand, Norway and Australia, where it spent nine weeks at the top position. Besides France and Hungary, \"Big Girls Don't Cry\" reached the top ten in all other international markets like the Netherlands, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. It was used in an episode of Pretty Little Liars, \"Father Knows Best\". It was also performed on the 2012 Glee episode \"Prom-asaurus\" by Rachel Berry (Lea Michele), Kurt Hummel (Chris Colfer), and Blaine Anderson (Darren Criss). The accompanying music video for the song was directed by Anthony Mandler and released in May 2007. It consists over Fergie and her love interest, portrayed by actor Milo Ventimiglia, in scenes documenting their turbulent relationship that ultimately ends with Fergie packing up her belongings and driving away in her car. The music video featured Fergie in apparel designed by Candie's and was used by the brand to promote their clothing line."@en ;

It became the first single released by Koopa to reach the UK top 40, charting at number 31. The song became notable when it was revealed that it would be the first single to reach the UK's chart without being released on any traditional 'physical' format. This occurred after a change in chart rules a week previously, which meant that all legally downloaded singles would be eligible to chart. The single's success led to speculation as to whether it represented the first in a new trend of bands charting without getting a deal with a record company."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"Don't Cry for Me Argentina\" is a song recorded by Julie Covington for the 1976 concept album, Evita, and was later included in the 1978 musical of the same name. The song was written and composed by Andrew Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice while they were researching the life of Argentinian leader Eva Per\u00F3n. It appeared at the opening and near the end of the show, initially as the spirit of the dead Eva exhorting the people of Argentina not to mourn her, and finally during Eva's speech from the balcony of Casa Rosada. Covington was signed by the songwriters for the track, based on her previous work in musicals. The Evita album had taken 3\u20134 months to record, since Rice was not satisfied with the intensity of the initial recordings. It had a number of different titles before \"Don't Cry for Me Argentina\" was decided as the final one. The song shares its melody with \"Oh What a Circus\" from the same show and lyrically consists of platitudes where Eva tries to win the favour of the people of Argentina. It was released in the United Kingdom on 12 November 1976 as the first single from the album, accompanied by national and trade advertising, full-colour posters, display sleeves as well as radio interviews. The song reached number-one on the UK Singles Chart and earned a gold certification from the British Phonographic Industry (BPI), with over a million copies sold. It also reached the top of the charts in Australia, Belgium, Ireland, New Zealand and the Netherlands. \"Don't Cry for Me Argentina\" was critically appreciated, with Rice and Lloyd Webber winning the 1977 Ivor Novello award in the category of Best Song Musically and Lyrically. When Evita moved to a London theatre, Covington\u2014who had become disenchanted with the whole project\u2014refused to reprise the part of Eva and the role went to Elaine Page. \"Don't Cry for Me Argentina\" has been covered by multiple artists, including The Carpenters, Olivia Newton-John, Sin\u00E9ad O'Connor as well as the TV series Glee\u200D actors Lea Michele and Chris Colfer. In 1996, American singer Madonna starred in the film adaptation of the musical in the title role. Her version of \"Don't Cry for Me Argentina\" was released as the second single from the film soundtrack on 4 February 1997. A separate version called the \"Miami Mix\", which included re-recorded vocals in English and Spanish and an Argentinean bandoneon in the song's intro, was promoted to radio. Madonna's vocals received positive critical response and the song went on to reach the top of the charts across Europe, Spain and the remix reached number-one on US Dance Club Songs charts. The song also reached the top-ten of the charts a number of nations, including the US Billboard Hot 100 chart, and received gold certifications from five of them."@en ;

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Don\u0027t_Forget_About_Us>	rdf:type	dbo:MusicalWork ;
	dbo:abstract	"\"Don't Forget About Us\" is a song by American singer-songwriter Mariah Carey. It was written by Carey, Jermaine Dupri, Bryan-Michael Cox and Johnt\u00E1 Austin, and released as the fifth single on December 12, 2005, for the re-issue of her tenth studio album, The Emancipation of Mimi (2005). Co-produced by the former three, the song is influenced by R&B and hip hop soul music genres, and lyrically chronicles the emotions felt by the protagonist after the loss of their relationship. Carey explained that the true meaning of the song is to be interpreted by the listener, therefore not disclosing its entire meaning publicly. The song received generally positive reviews from music critics, with many heavily comparing it to Carey's previous single \"We Belong Together\". Several reviewers felt the song's similarity marked Carey's lack of creativity with it, while others embraced its radio-friendly formula. \"Don't Forget About Us\" became Carey's seventeenth chart topping single on the US Billboard Hot 100, tying the record for most number-one singles by a solo artist set by Elvis Presley 36 years before. Internationally, the song topped the singles chart in Belgium and Finland, and reached the top-ten in Hungary and the Netherlands. Carey performed the song at the 33rd annual American Music Awards, and during the half-time of the Thanksgiving game between the Detroit Lions and the Atlanta Falcons. Additionally, the song was included on the set-lists of Carey's The Adventures of Mimi and Angels Advocate Tours. The song's music video chronicles the two time frames, Carey in the present, as well as the past memories she shared with her ex-lover that continue to haunt her. At the 49th annual Grammy Awards, \"Don't Forget About Us\" was nominated for two awards during the ceremony held on February 11, 2007."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"Don't Let Me Be the Last to Know\" is a song recorded by American singer Britney Spears for her second studio album, Oops!... I Did It Again (2000). It was released on March 5, 2001, by JIVE Records as the fourth and final single from the album. After meeting with producer Robert John \"Mutt\" Lange in Switzerland, Spears recorded several songs for the album, including \"Don't Let Me Be the Last to Know\", which she considered one of her favorites on the album. Additional lyrics were written by guitar player Keith Scott and country pop singer Shania Twain. The teen-pop ballad speaks of a woman wanting to hear her boyfriend say that he needs loves her, and features a sound similar to David Bowie and Iggy Pop's song \"China Girl\" (1983). \"Don't Let Me Be the Last to Know\" received mostly positive reviews from music critics, who considered it a good break from the album's genre and praised Spears' vocals, comparing them to those of Twain and Stevie Wonder. The song attained moderate commercial success, reaching number one in Romania, and peaking inside the top ten in Austria, Europe and Switzerland, while reaching top twenty positions in many European countries. \"Don't Let Me Be the Last to Know\" was only released for mainstream radio in the United States; therefore, it failed to chart on any major music chart in the country. An accompanying music video, directed by Herb Ritts, portrays Spears in love scenes with her fictional boyfriend, played by French model Brice Durand. The singer's real-life boyfriend at the time Justin Timberlake, however, was said to be annoyed at the kissing scenes, while the original video was considered too racy at the time by Spears' mother, Lynne, because it contained sexually explicit material. Parts of the video were edited before its release to the public on March 2, 2001. As part of promotion for the song, Spears performed it at TRL, Saturday Night Live, and The View. It has also been included on four of her concert tours. \"Don't Let Me Be the Last to Know\" was nominated at Nickelodeon Kids' Choice Awards in the category of \"Best Song\" in 2002. Spears has named \"Don't Let Me Be the Last to Know\" one of her favorite songs from her career."@en ;

dbr:Margaritaville	rdf:type	dbo:MusicalWork ;
	dbo:abstract	"\"Margaritaville\" is a 1977 song by American popular music singer-songwriter Jimmy Buffett from the album Changes in Latitudes, Changes in Attitudes. This song was written about a drink Buffett discovered at Lung's Cocina del Sur restaurant on Anderson Lane in Austin, Texas, and the first huge surge of tourists who descended on Key West, Florida around that time. He wrote most of the song that night at a friend's house in Austin, and finished it while spending time in Key West. In the United States \"Margaritaville\" reached number eight on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, and went to number one on the Easy Listening chart, also peaking at #13 on the Hot Country Songs chart. Billboard ranked it number 14 on its 1977 Pop Singles year-end chart. It remains Buffett's highest charting solo single. Named for the cocktail margarita, with lyrics reflecting a laid-back lifestyle in a tropical climate, \"Margaritaville\" has come to define Buffett's music and career. The relative importance of the song to Buffett's career is referred to obliquely in a parenthetical plural in the title of a Buffett greatest hits compilation album, Songs You Know By Heart: Jimmy Buffett's Greatest Hit(s). The name has been used in the title of other Buffett compilation albums such as Meet Me In Margaritaville: The Ultimate Collection and is also the name of several commercial products licensed by Buffett (see below). Popular culture references, throughout the years and remakes attest to the song's continuing popularity. \"Margaritaville\" has been inducted into the 2016 Grammy Hall of Fame for its cultural and historic significance."@en ;

The single is Powderfinger's most successful; it peaked at number four on the Australian ARIA Singles Chart, and charted in the United States on the Hot Modern Rock Tracks chart\u2014the first Powderfinger song to do so. Powderfinger frontman Bernard Fanning wrote the lyrics for \"My Happiness\" as a reflection on the time the band spent touring to promote their work, and the loneliness that came as a result. It was inspired by his love of gospel and soul music. The rest of the band are co-credited with Fanning for composing the track. Despite its melancholy mood, \"My Happiness\" is considered by many to be a love song, a suggestion Fanning regards as mystifying. \"My Happiness\" was released as a single with \"My Kind of Scene\" as a B-side. It was instantly successful, charting highly in Australia and New Zealand. It won an ARIA Award and an APRA Award and topped the Triple J Hottest 100 in 2000 as well as coming 27th in the 2009 Hottest 100 of all Time. \"My Happiness\" was highly praised by critics, with even negative reviews of Odyssey Number Five noting it as a highlight, especially for its catchy chorus. \"My Kind of Scene\" was equally popular.

dbr:My_Sweet_Lord	rdf:type	dbo:MusicalWork ;
	dbo:abstract	"\"My Sweet Lord\" is a song by English musician and former Beatle George Harrison that was released in November 1970 on his triple album All Things Must Pass. Also issued as a single, Harrison's first as a solo artist, \"My Sweet Lord\" topped charts worldwide and was the biggest-selling single of 1971 in the UK. In America and Britain, the song was the first number 1 single by an ex-Beatle. Harrison originally gave the song to his fellow Apple Records artist Billy Preston to record; this version, which Harrison co-produced, appeared on Preston's Encouraging Words album in September 1970. Harrison wrote \"My Sweet Lord\" in praise of the Hindu god Krishna, while at the same time intending the lyrics to serve as a call to abandon religious sectarianism through his deliberate blending of the Hebrew word hallelujah with chants of \"Hare Krishna\" and Vedic prayer. The recording features producer Phil Spector's Wall of Sound treatment and heralded the arrival of Harrison's much-admired slide guitar technique, which one biographer described as being \"musically as distinctive a signature as the mark of Zorro\". Preston, Ringo Starr, Eric Clapton and the group Badfinger are among the other musicians appearing on the recording. Later in the 1970s, \"My Sweet Lord\" was at the centre of a heavily publicised copyright infringement suit, due to its similarity to the Ronnie Mack song \"He's So Fine\", a 1963 hit for the New York girl group the Chiffons. In 1976, Harrison was found to have subconsciously plagiarised the earlier tune, a verdict that had repercussions throughout the music industry. He claimed to have used the out-of-copyright \"Oh Happy Day\", a Christian hymn, as his inspiration for the song's melody. Harrison performed \"My Sweet Lord\" at the Concert for Bangladesh in August 1971, and it remains the most popular composition from his post-Beatles career. He reworked the song as \"My Sweet Lord (2000)\" for inclusion as a bonus track on the 30th anniversary reissue of All Things Must Pass. Many artists have covered the song including Andy Williams, Peggy Lee, Edwin Starr, Johnny Mathis, Nina Simone, Julio Iglesias, Richie Havens, Megadeth, Boy George, Elton John, Jim James, Bonnie Bramlett and Elliott Smith. \"My Sweet Lord\" is ranked 460th on Rolling Stone magazine's list of \"the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time\". The song reached number 1 in Britain for a second time when re-released in January 2002, two months after Harrison's death. As of 2016, \"My Sweet Lord\" remains the last number 1 hit in the UK by a former member of the Beatles."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"Reach Out I'll Be There\" (also formatted as \"Reach Out (I'll Be There)\") is a 1966 song recorded by the Four Tops for the Motown label. Written and produced by Motown's main production team Holland\u2013Dozier\u2013Holland, the song is one of the most well-known Motown tunes of the 1960s and is today considered The Tops' signature song. It was the number one song on the Rhythm & Blues charts for two weeks, and on the Billboard Hot 100 for two weeks, from October 15\u201322, 1966. It replaced \"Cherish\" by The Association, and was itself replaced by \"96 Tears\" by Question Mark & the Mysterians. Billboard ranked the record as the no. 4 song for 1966. Rolling Stone later ranked this version #206 on their list of \"The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time\". This version is also currently ranked as the 56th best song of all time, as well as the #4 song of 1966, in an aggregation of critics' lists at Acclaimed Music. The track also reached no. 1 in the UK Singles Chart, becoming Motown's second UK chart-topper after The Supremes hit no. 1 with \"Baby Love\" in late 1964. It had replaced Jim Reeves' \"Distant Drums\" at number one in October 1966 and stayed there for three weeks before being replaced by The Beach Boys' \"Good Vibrations\" in November."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"Souvenir\" is a song written by Paul Humphreys and Martin Cooper of Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark and released as the first single from their 1981 album Architecture & Morality. It is sung by Humphreys, who ordinarily functions as keyboard player and backing vocalist. The track has minimal lyrical content and is characterised by slowed-down choir sounds offset by pulsing major key piano chords. Its \"gentle, sparkling\" synthesizer hook substitutes for a vocal chorus, as with other OMD compositions. \"Souvenir\" became a major international hit for the band. Peaking at number 3 on the UK Singles Chart, it remains the group's highest-charting single in their home country, along with 1991's \"Sailing on the Seven Seas\". The song also reached the Top 10 in several European territories, including topping the charts in France, Spain and Portugal. Having gained little mainstream airplay in recent years, \"Souvenir\" has been hailed as a forgotten classic within popular music. The makers of the New Musical Express and Uncut, in the 2011 publication 501 Lost Songs, lauded the track as a \"classic piece of early '80s melancholy.\" Dave Thompson in AllMusic wrote: \"OMD at their most luminescent, 'Souvenir' was a permanent memento of the group's early power.\" Critic Ned Raggett praised Humphreys' vocal, as well as the mid-song instrumental break. Erasure vocalist Andy Bell has said that he is always moved to tears upon hearing \"Souvenir\"."@en ;

The \"Sunshine Superman\" single was backed with \"The Trip\" on both the United States and United Kingdom releases. It has been described as having, \"proven to be [one of the] classics of the era,\" and as, \"the quintessential bright summer sing along\". \"Sunshine Superman\" reached the top of the Billboard Hot 100 in the United States, and subsequently became the title track of Donovan's third album, Sunshine Superman. A different mix of \"The Trip\" (without harmonica) is also included in the album. It was the first product from the highly successful three-year collaboration between Donovan and producer Mickie Most and is generally considered to be one of the first examples of the musical genre that came to be known as psychedelia. The song features styles of psychedelic folk, psychedelic rock and psychedelic pop. The song was written for Donovan's future wife Linda Lawrence. The lyrics of the song mention not only Superman, but also another DC Comics superhero, Green Lantern. Chart positions were No. 1 , and No. 2 (the single was released in December 1966 in the UK).

	dbo:abstract	"\"Tell Him\" is a duet between Barbra Streisand and Celine Dion. It was released on November 3, 1997 as the first single from Dion's Let's Talk About Love and Streisand's Higher Ground albums. On March 24, 1997 Dion became the first artist ever to perform twice on the same Academy Awards night. In addition to singing \"Because You Loved Me,\" she also sang \"I Finally Found Someone\" from the movie The Mirror Has Two Faces, recorded by Barbra Streisand and Bryan Adams. Streisand preferred not to perform that night and Natalie Cole had been scheduled to sing her song instead. But Cole pulled out and two days before the Oscar night, Dion was asked if she could do it. Although nervous, she accepted and managed to perform on the night. A few days later, Streisand sent Dion flowers and a note: \"I watched the tape afterwards, you sang my song beautifully and I regret I wasn't in the room to hear you, next time let's make one together. I really wish your song would have won, you are a wonderful singer.\" That note wasn't left without an answer and Ren\u00E9 Ang\u00E9lil called up David Foster to write a song for them, and the result was \"Tell Him.\" On October 7, 1997 \"Tell Him\" had its first runs on the United States radio waves. This duet was rejected however by non-adult contemporary radio stations. Even if the song was a large adult contemporary hit, Sony Music Entertainment cancelled the U.S. single release, because it did not have a broad enough support to put the song on top of the charts. However, \"Tell Him\" was a huge hit outside the U.S. A radio version of the song was commissioned. This version featuring a high-frequent flute playing during Dion's bridge. It was the opening track of the all releases of the song. The music video was directed by Scott Floyd Lochmus and premiered on VH1, on October 24, 1997.

	dbo:abstract	"\"Tell Me a Lie\" is a song written by Mickey Buckins and Barbara Wyrick, and most notably recorded by American country music artist Janie Fricke. It was released in September 1983 as the fourth single from the album It Ain't Easy. In 1983, Janie Fricke picked up the song \"Tell Me a Lie\" as to be released as her next single in 1983. During this time, Fricke racked up a good amount of hits, like \"It Ain't Easy Bein' Easy\" and \"I Need Someone to Hold Me When I Cry\". The song had been originally recorded and released during the 1970s by country recording artist Lynn Anderson. The song had been released on Anderson's You're My Man album, which featured her number 1 hit single \"You're My Man\". However, because of the big success of \"You're My Man\", \"Tell Me a Lie\" was never released as a single by Anderson, probably because she had other songs that she'd wanted to release as singles. \"Tell Me a Lie\" would however become a Top 20 pop hit and a minor country hit for female singer Sami Jo in 1974. In 1981, Bettye LaVette recorded an R&B version of the song on Motown. It was released as the title track of her album the following year. Shortly thereafter, Fricke's record producer at the time Billy Sherrill, had suggested that Fricke would record the song. Listening to Sherrill, Fricke recorded the song in 1983. By this time though, Fricke had produced a number 1 hit in 1983 called \"It Ain't Easy Bein' Easy\". Fricke soon released \"Tell Me a Lie\" as a single on the country charts that year. By 1983, \"Tell Me a Lie\" was Janie Fricke's fourth number one hit on the Country charts. The song and its album that it was featured on titled It Ain't Easy became very successful and became one of Fricke's signature songs. Since the song's release, it has been included in numerous multi-artist compilation albums. Despite the song's pop production, as well as its success on the country charts, it did not reach the pop singles chart. In 2004, Fricke released a bluegrass album, entitled The Bluegrass Sessions, which featured remakes of Fricke's biggest hits. The album featured \"Tell Me a Lie\"."@en ;

Frank Baum's The Wonderful Wizard of Oz. The movie featured an entirely African American cast and was based on the 1975 Broadway musical The Wiz. After the original soundtrack version was recorded, Michael Jackson and Quincy Jones went back into the studio and re-recorded the track. It was the re-recording that was released in January 1979 as the second single from The Wiz: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack, following the release of \"Ease On Down the Road\" in 1978, and was Michael's first solo chart single on Epic Records. The 7\" version included \"You Can't Win, parts 1 & 2\". The full length version was released on 12\" and was included on The Ultimate Collection in 2004. The single only charted in the United States, where it reached number 81 on the Billboard Hot 100 and number 42 on the R&B singles chart. Since its release, the song has been well received by music critics. The song has been performed by contemporary singers such as Jill Scott and Charles Grigsby. In 1982, part 2 of the song, in which Michael Jackson repeatedly sings \"Can't get outta the game\", was vocally overdubbed and retitled \"Can't Get Outta the Rain\"; it became the B-side of the first single of his landmark album Thriller: \"The Girl Is Mine\"."@en ;

Written and produced by Dr. Luke along with Cathy Dennis and Steven Wolf, it was released on 24 September 2007 by Island Records as the lead single from the album, the first to feature Amelle Berrabah on all tracks. An uptempo pop track that combines heavy elements of pop rock, and dance-pop, it infuses light electronic sounds. Lyrically, \"About You Now\" finds the protagonist thinking deeply over her relationship with her love interest from whom she parted. The song was generally well received by music critics, who complimented its genre mixing production as well as its aurally remarkable US pop influence. Some of them also described the song as a \"pop-electro-rock masterpiece\" and called it the best Sugababes single in years. Upon its release, \"About You Now\" became the group's sixth UK number one hit and highest-charting single since 2005's \"Push the Button.\" It remained atop the UK Singles Chart for four weeks. It also reached the top of the charts in Hungary, as well as the top ten in Austria, Belgium, Germany, Ireland, Norway, and Spain. The Sugababes' highest-selling single to date, it has sold 540,500 copies as of October 2015. \"About You Now\" was nominated for a 2008 BRIT Award for Best British Single. In the 2009 edition of Guinness World Records, \"About You Now\" was listed as the \"first track by a British pop act to top the singles chart solely on downloads\". The song was also named as the \"biggest chart mover to the number one position in the UK\". In December 2009, it was revealed by BBC that \"About You Now\" was the UK's fifth most-played song of the decade (2000\u201309).

	dbo:abstract	"\"These Are the Days of Our Lives\" is a song by the British rock band Queen. Although credited to the whole band, it was largely written by their drummer Roger Taylor, and is the eighth track on the band's 1991 album Innuendo. Keyboards were programmed by the four band members in the studio, and conga percussion (a synthesised conga) was recorded by their producer David Richards (although it was mimed in the video by Roger Taylor). It was released as a single in the United States on Freddie Mercury's 45th birthday, 5 September 1991, and as double A-side single in the UK three months later on 9 December, in the wake of Mercury's death, with the seminal Queen track \"Bohemian Rhapsody\". The single debuted at #1 on the UK Singles Chart, and remained at the top for five weeks. The song was awarded a BRIT Award for \"Best Single\" in 1992. \"These Are the Days of Our Lives\" hearkens back to similarly themed 1975 Queen song \"Love of My Life\", twice using the line \"I still love you\". At the end of the song, Mercury simply speaks those words, as he would often do in live versions of \"Love of My Life.\""@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"Ain't Nobody\" is a song recorded by the American band Rufus and Chaka Khan. It was released on November 4, 1983, as a bonus track for their live album Stompin' at the Savoy. \"Ain't Nobody\" quickly gathered popularity, and reached number one on the U.S. R&B chart, and number twenty-two on the US Billboard Hot 100. It has become one of Khan's signature songs. Rufus keyboardist David \"Hawk\" Wolinski wrote the song around a repeating synthesizer loop backed by a Linn LM-1 drum computer. However, drummer John J. R. Robinson played real drums for the recording session. The band did a democratic vote and they decided to include the song in their album repertoire. Once the song was recorded, Warner executives wanted to issue another song as the album's first single.[citation needed] Wolinski threatened to give the song to Michael Jackson and producer Quincy Jones for Thriller if the song was not the lead-off single. The label relented and \"Ain't Nobody\" was issued and hit number 1 on the R&B chart for the week ending October 15, 1983. The song was also included in the soundtrack of the movie Breakin'."@en ;

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Baby,_Please_Don\u0027t_Go>	rdf:type	dbo:MusicalWork ;
	dbo:abstract	"\"Baby, Please Don't Go\" is a blues song which has been called \"one of the most played, arranged, and rearranged pieces in blues history\" by music historian Gerard Herzhaft. It was likely an adaptation of \"Long John\", an old folk theme dating back to slavery in the United States. Delta blues musician Big Joe Williams popularized it with several versions beginning in 1935. The song's roots have been traced back to nineteenth-century American songs which deal with themes of bondage and imprisonment. \"Baby, Please Don't Go\" became an early blues standard with recordings by several blues musicians, such as Papa Charlie McCoy, Leonard \"Baby Doo\" Caston, Lightnin' Hopkins, John Lee Hooker and Big Bill Broonzy. After World War II, Chicago blues and rhythm and blues artists adapted the song to newer music styles. In 1952, a doo-wop version by the Orioles reached the top ten on the race records chart. In 1953, Muddy Waters recorded the song as an electric Chicago-ensemble blues piece, which influenced many subsequent renditions. In the 1960s, \"Baby, Please Don't Go\" became a popular rock song after the Northern Irish group Them recorded it in 1964. Several music writers have identified Jimmy Page, a studio guitarist at the time, as participating in the recording, although his exact contributions are unclear. Subsequently, Them's uptempo rock arrangement has become a rock standard. \"Baby, Please Don't Go\" has been inducted into both the Blues and Rock and Roll Halls of Fame."@en ;

The name is taken from the Greek goddess, Athena, who famously depicted in Athenian statues under the form of Pallas Athena. Hence, the name of the song is a suggestion of religion and icons and sets the mood for a dark piece concerning the power that religion has over man. The lyrics are rather sparse, but the phrase beginning the piece, \"God is on top of it, that's all,\" delivered as though from an African-American preacher, is ominous and intimidating, accompanied with the sound of strings delivering a sorrowful melody. The piece develops into a techno dance piece, using string sounds to hold the ominous mood while overlaid atop bass and drums. David Bowie's saxophone playing is amplified into a scream-like sound, which solos, along with Lester Bowie on trumpet. A lyric, \"We are, we are, we are, we are praying,\" is repeated through the close of the song in a somber, monk-like fashion. Ultimately, the song restates Bowie's interest in how man relates with God. Bowie used to play a drum'n'bass version of the song during his 1997 Earthling tour, and a live version recorded at Paradiso, Holland 10 June 1997 was released as a single under the name Tao Jones Index, a very limited edition only available on 12\" vinyl. Bowie played as Tao Jones Index during his performance in a dance tent at Phoenix Festival in 1997. It is a pun based on his birth name, David Jones, and his then recent bond offering to the Dow Jones Index. Tao, a Chinese character pronounced \"dao,\" not only stands for the Chinese equivalent to Bowie's first initial, \"D\", but also has heavy religious implications through its correlation to Taoism, therefore contributing to the religious overtones of \"Pallas Athena.\" The Chinese character \u9053 means \"the way\" (the path, the route). It was announced in March 2010 that a digital download EP would be made available in June 2010."@en ;

Recorded and released in 1987, it was a number-one hit in many countries and is sometimes regarded as a significant milestone in the development of British house music and music sampling. The song derives its title directly from a lyrical sample from \"I Know You Got Soul\", a hit single by 4th & B'way/Island labelmates, Eric B. & Rakim, released only months prior in that same year. The single was the product of an uneasy collaboration between electronica-fusion group Colourbox and alternative rock band A R Kane, two groups signed to the independent label 4AD. The link-up was suggested by label founder Ivo Watts-Russell after the two groups had independently sounded him out about the possibility of releasing a commercially oriented dance record, inspired by the American house music that was starting to make an impact on the UK chart. When the M|A|R|R|S project was first released early in 1987, the popularity of the style of the song had already started to grow."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"Ring the Alarm\" is a song recorded by American singer Beyonc\u00E9 Knowles for her second studio album, B'Day (2006). It was composed by Knowles, Britney Spears, Kasseem \"Swizz Beatz\" Dean and Sean Garrett. Columbia Records released \"Ring the Alarm\" as the second single from B'Day in the United States on October 17, 2006, while \"Irreplaceable\" (2006) was serviced as the album's second international and third US single. The song's development was motivated by Knowles' role in the Broadway musical adaptation Dreamgirls (2006). The cover art of \"Ring the Alarm\" proved controversial because Knowles used alligators during the photography session. People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA), declared that Knowles' posing with a baby alligator was arguably abusive to an animal. \"Ring the Alarm\" is an R&B song with punk rock influences. Its introduction features a blaring siren, which sets an aggressive tone. The song's lyrics revolve a woman who feels threatened, and is unwilling to allow another woman to profit from the protagonist's efforts to improve her lover's life. The lyrics were rumored to be about Barbadian recording artist Rihanna's relationship with Jay-Z; Knowles refuted the allegation in an interview with Seventeen magazine. The song was received with mixed reception for contemporary music critics, who noted that it was different from Knowles' previous work. While some commended her willingness to take risks, others were polarized about her aggressive vocals. \"Ring the Alarm\" was nominated for Best Female R&B Vocal Performance at the 49th Grammy Awards. The single debuted at number 12 on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart, becoming Knowles' highest US debut. It reached number 11 on the chart, becoming her first solo single to peak below the top 10. Its accompanying music video was inspired by the 1992 film Basic Instinct and was directed by Sophie Muller. It was filmed inside a cavernous hangar on the Brooklyn waterfront in New York City. The video garnered generally mixed reviews critics, who universally thought that it was eccentric. Knowles promoted \"Ring the Alarm\" through various live performances on televised shows and awards ceremonies, including the 2006 MTV Video Music Awards. The song was included on her set list on The Beyonc\u00E9 Experience (2007) in Los Angeles and her world tour, I Am... Tour. (2009\u201310)"@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"Be Strong\" is a pop ballad written by Bridget Benenate, Matthew Gerrard, and Delta Goodrem, produced by Gerrard for Goodrem's second album Mistaken Identity (2004). It was released as the album's fifth and final single in Australia as a digital download on 16 October 2005. At the time of release, digital downloads were not included as part of the main singles chart, therefore it was ineligible to chart. In the DVD for her album Mistaken Identity, Goodrem reveals she wrote the song in support of her good friend and fellow cancer sufferer, late actress Belinda Emmett. \"Be Strong\" was released with two exclusive and previously unreleased live B-sides: \"Be Strong\" and \"Last Night on Earth\", both recorded at the Sydney Super Dome on Goodrem's 2005 Visualise Tour. The video for \"Be Strong\" was also a hit on both the TV and the internet, taking out the number-one spot on the Yahoo! Music Video chart. It featured footage from Goodrem's before-mentioned, Visualise Tour in 2005. The single was also released as a strictly limited edition promotional CD single.

It was released on 13 September 1997 as a tribute single to the late Diana, Princess of Wales, with the global proceeds from the song going towards Diana's charities. In many countries, it was pressed as a double A-side with \"Something About the Way You Look Tonight\". It was produced by Sir George Martin. According to the Recording Industry Association of America, with certified sales, it is \"the best-selling single of all time.\" The Guinness World Records 2009 states that the song is \"the biggest-selling single since UK and US singles charts began in the 1950s, having accumulated worldwide sales of 33 million copies\". After being released, \"Candle in the Wind 1997\" entered at number one in the UK Singles Chart, John's fourth UK number one single, and became the best-selling single in UK Chart history. In October it became John's ninth U.S. number one single, where it topped the Billboard Hot 100 for 14 weeks, and is the best-selling single in Billboard history, and was the first single certified Diamond in the U.S. The song topped the German Singles Chart for seven weeks, the Australian ARIA Charts for six weeks, reached number one in Japan, Canada, France and music charts around the world. The 1997 version won John the Grammy Award for Best Male Pop Vocal Performance at the 40th Grammy Awards ceremony in 1998. At the 1998 Brit Awards the song was nominated for the Brit Award for Best British Single. The lyrics of the earlier version of \"Candle in the Wind\", written by Bernie Taupin, were a tribute to Marilyn Monroe. The opening lines of the 1973 version, \"Goodbye Norma Jeane, though I never knew you at all,\" were adapted to \"Goodbye England's rose, may you ever grow in our hearts.\" Most of the lyrics were adapted to suit the circumstances of Diana's life and death, but a notable omission was the line, \"Even when you died, the press still hounded you.\" which was replaced with the lyric, \"Even though we try, the truth brings us to tears.\""@en ;

It reached No. 3 in Canada, and it was a No. 1 hit on the U.S. adult contemporary chart. The song's No. 7 UK chart placing meant that Astley became the first male solo artist to have his first eight singles reach the British Top 10. The song is a moving soul ballad, unlike many of Astley's other more famous dance-oriented hit singles (\"Never Gonna Give You Up\"). It was co-written by British singer-songwriter Rob Fisher, formerly one half of the 1980s pop group Naked Eyes and Climie Fisher. To date, the song was Astley's last appearance in the Top 10 in either the U.S. or U.K. The song has been sung by Rick Astley in duet with Soren Sko and covered by Thomas Anders (ex-Modern Talking)."@en ;

The track was number one on the UK Singles Chart for five weeks, and ended 2007 as the year's third biggest-selling single in that country. In the U.S., \"Grace Kelly\" was made available for digital download on 16 January 2007. This song was also #89 on MTV Asia's list of Top 100 Hits of 2007. It was designed to be a mocking satire of musicians who try to reinvent themselves to be popular. The song is titled after Academy Award-winning American film and stage actress, and Princess of Monaco, Grace Kelly. The bit of dialogue used in the song is from the film The Country Girl. Mika claims the song was inspired after a bad experience with a record company executive, in which he was told to be more like Craig David. The lyric \"So I try a little Freddie\" is a reference to Queen's Freddie Mercury, to whose singing voice Mika's has been compared. On at least one occasion, Mika confirmed that he used the main melody from Figaro's famous aria Largo al factotum in the opera The Barber of Seville by Gioachino Rossini. Mika performed the song at the MTV Europe Music Awards 2007 in Munich, and at the 2008 BRIT Awards at the Earls Court Exhibition Centre, London where it was nominated for Best British Single.

dbr:Hung_Up	rdf:type	dbo:MusicalWork ;
	dbo:abstract	"\"Hung Up\" is a song by American singer Madonna from her tenth studio album Confessions on a Dance Floor (2005). It was written and produced by Madonna in collaboration with Stuart Price, and released as the lead single from the album. Initially used in a number of television advertisements and serials, the song was released as the album's lead single on October 17, 2005. It has also made an appearance on her 2009 greatest hits album, Celebration. It also became Madonna's first track to be released to the iTunes Store for digital download. \"Hung Up\" prominently features a sample from the instrumental introduction to ABBA's hit single \"Gimme! Gimme! Gimme! (A Man After Midnight)\", for which Madonna personally bought permission from ABBA's songwriters Benny Andersson and Bj\u00F6rn Ulvaeus. Musically the song is influenced by 1980s pop, with a chugging groove and chorus and a background element of a ticking clock that suggests the fear of wasting time. Lyrically the song is written as a traditional dance number about a strong, independent woman who has relationship troubles. \"Hung Up\" received critical praise from reviewers, who believed that the track would restore the singer's popularity, which had diminished following the release of her 2003 album American Life. Critics suggested it was her best dance track to date and have compared it favorably to other Madonna tracks in the same genre. They also complimented the effective synchronization of the ABBA sample with the actual song. \"Hung Up\" became a worldwide commercial success, peaking atop the charts of 41 countries and earning a place in the Guinness Book of World Records. It was Madonna's 36th top 10 single on the Billboard Hot 100, tying her with Elvis Presley as the artist with most top ten hits. It also became the most successful dance song of the decade in the United States. \"Hung Up\" remains one of the best-selling singles of all time, with sales of over nine million copies worldwide. The music video is a tribute to John Travolta, his movies and to dancing in general. Directed by Johan Renck, the clip starts with Madonna clad in a pink leotard dancing alone in a ballet studio and concludes at a gaming parlor where she dances with her backup troupe. Interspersed are scenes of people displaying their dancing skills in a variety of settings, including a Los Angeles residential neighborhood, a small restaurant and the London Underground. It also features the physical discipline Parkour. Madonna has performed the song in a number of live appearances, including as the finale number in 2006's Confessions Tour, a heavy metal-inspired arrangement in the 2008 Sticky & Sweet Tour and during the 2012 MDNA Tour where the singer performed the song while slacklining."@en ;

It was produced by Narada Michael Walden, and written by George Merrill and Shannon Rubicam of the band Boy Meets Girl, who had previously written the number-one Whitney Houston hit \"How Will I Know.\" The original arrangement was more of a country tune, but was transformed by Walden to make it a dance song. The song received mixed reviews from critics, who compared the musical arrangement to her own \"How Will I Know\" and Cyndi Lauper's \"Girls Just Want to Have Fun.\" The song won the Grammy Award for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance at the 30th Grammy Awards. The single was a commercial success, topping the charts in 13 countries including Australia, Italy, Germany and the UK. In the US, it became her fourth consecutive number one single and sold over one million copies, making it her biggest hit in that country at the time.

	dbo:abstract	"\"I Want to Break Free\" (About this sound sample ) is a song by British rock band Queen, from their eleventh studio album The Works (1984). Written by bassist John Deacon, it was distributed as a single on 7-inch and 12-inch vinyl records and 3-inch and 5-inch CDs. The song had three versions: album, single and extended, differing in length by more than a factor of 2. It came to be included in most live concerts by the group, in several videos, and in The Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert where it was sung by Lisa Stansfield. The song is largely known for its music video for which all the band members dressed in women's clothes, a concept proposed by Roger Taylor, which parodied the long-running ITV soap opera Coronation Street. The second part of the video included a composition rehearsed and performed with the Royal Ballet and choreographed by Wayne Eagling. Whereas the parody was acclaimed in the United Kingdom, it was considered controversial in the United States and banned by MTV and other stations. After its release in 1984 the single of the song was well received all over Europe and South America, where it was listed within top ten and regarded as an anthem of fight against oppression. The single reached only the 45th position in the US charts, but reached number 3 in the UK and was certified silver with 200,000+ copies sold."@en ;

It also reached #7 on the UK Singles Chart. The song was certified Gold by the RIAA, signifying sales of one million copies in the US. The song is Simon's longest-charting hit. Her earlier hit \"You're So Vain\" spent three weeks at #1; however, its chart run was two months shorter than that of \"Nobody Does It Better.\" The title of the theme was later used for Simon's 1999 greatest hits compilation, The Very Best of Carly Simon: Nobody Does It Better. Among the most successful Bond theme songs, \"Nobody Does It Better\" received an Academy Award nomination for Best Original Song where it lost to \"You Light Up My Life\", as well as a Golden Globe Award nomination.

It achieved huge success in many countries, topping many international charts. In France, the song held the country's number one slot for seven weeks and as of August 2014, it was the 19th best-selling single of the 21st century in France, with 565,000 units sold. In 2004, the song was covered by 3rd Wish featuring Baby Bash produced by Mintman, but this version was less successful than the original version (#7 In Switzerland, #2 in Austria, #12 in France). Later, in 2005, the song was covered by Los Hor\u00F3scopos de Durango in their album Y Seguimos con Duranguense. Latin R&B artist Frankie J made an English and more soul-styled version of the song, featuring Baby Bash, which was called \"Obsession (No Es Amor)\". This version, although not having success in Latin America and Europe, was successful in the U.S., even reaching number three on the Billboard Hot 100 chart."@en ;

In an interview with Rolling Stone, Brandon Flowers said \"This is the story of trying to meet someone in a club.\" It is written in the key of B-flat minor. When the Killers first started out, their music was little noticed by music-buyers and the media, which is why \"Somebody Told Me\" has been released twice in slightly different forms. The first, with the pink background cover, is the rarer version of the single as it was their first release of it; due to poor sales not as many were produced. When re-released, the cover-art sported a blue background color and is the more common version of the single. The single peaked at #51 on the US Billboard Hot 100. In the UK it charted at number 28 upon its first release in March 2004 becoming the band's first top 40 hit, it was then re-released in January 2005 and reached number 3. Although not as successful as \"Mr. Brightside\", it still became one of the band's biggest hits to date. In Australia, the song was ranked #4 on Triple J's Hottest 100 of 2004. In 2009 it was voted at Number 9 in UK radio station XFM's Top 100 songs of the decade."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"Waiting for Tonight\" is a song written by Maria Christensen, Michael Garvin, and Phil Temple. It was originally written and recorded for American girl group 3rd Party's debut studio album, Alive (1997). Two years after the group disbanded, American entertainer Jennifer Lopez recorded her own version of the song for her debut studio album, On the 6 (1999). Ric Wake and Richie Jones provided production for Lopez's dance-pop version of \"Waiting for Tonight\", which differs from the German-sounding Europop version that was recorded by 3rd Party. A Spanish version of the song, entitled \"Una Noche M\u00E1s\", was adapted by Manny Benito and also recorded for the album. \"Waiting for Tonight\" was released on November 1, 1999, by the Work Group, as the third single from On the 6. \"Waiting for Tonight\" is considered by various publications, such as Entertainment Weekly and the Chicago Tribune, to be the best song of Lopez's career. Contemporary music critics have also credited the song with making her a leading artist in the dance-pop movement. It was used frequently as a celebratory anthem in anticipation for the dawn of the new millennium. The single was a commercial success, reaching the top ten in Australia, Finland, France, Italy, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Spain, the United Kingdom, and the United States. \"Waiting for Tonight\" became Lopez's first song to top the US Billboard Hot Dance Club Songs chart. The song earned her a nomination for Best Dance Recording at the 42nd Annual Grammy Awards in 2000. The accompanying music video for \"Waiting for Tonight\" was directed by Francis Lawrence and depicts a Y2K dance party. The video was widely popular, receiving heavy rotation on MTV, and its emphasis on Lopez's body led to increased media attention surrounding the entertainer. It was nominated for numerous awards, including two at the 2000 MTV Video Music Awards, where it received the Best Dance Video recognition. Critics have noted the clip being the inspiration for music videos by Adam Lambert, Rihanna, and Selena Gomez, among others. Lopez has performed \"Waiting for Tonight\" on various television programs, such as Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve, at various award ceremonies, such as the 11th Billboard Music Awards, and in two of her concert tours, with the most recent being the Dance Again World Tour."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"What's on Your Mind (Pure Energy)\" is a song by American synthpop band Information Society that was released as a single in 1988. The \"Pure Energy\" subtitle derives from a sample of Leonard Nimoy's voice from the Star Trek episode \"Errand of Mercy\". There is also a sample of DeForest Kelley's voice from the episode \"I, Mudd\". John Leland of Spin magazine called it a \"pretty potent dance record\". In 2009, VH1 ran a countdown of the 100 Greatest One Hit Wonders Of The '80s. Information Society's \"What's on Your Mind (Pure Energy)\" placed at #74 on the countdown despite the fact that the group had two other Top 40 hits: \"Walking Away\" (#9) and \"Think\" (#28). The song was a big hit in the US, spending 25 weeks on the Billboard Hot 100, peaking at #3 in October 1988. The song was featured in Loverboy and American Psycho. A remixed version was included in American Psycho's soundtrack. In 1989, Pittsburgh radio station WYDD-FM executed an early viral marketing plan by playing this song non-stop in a loop for 25.5 hours \u2014 focusing on a repeat of the \"Pure Energy\" sample from Leonard Nimoy as Star Trek's Mr. Spock. The marketing stunt caused listeners to call emergency services concerned that some calamity befell the DJs and other station employees. Bob Hank, general manager at the time, told reporters he was only trying to draw attention to the station's switch in format and new call letters WNRJ (W-N-R-J = \"energy\"). \"We were just trying to draw a little bit of attention,\" Hank said. \"We never dreamed it would go this far\"."@en ;

It also is rumored that the song talks about the relationship the two had in the TV series 24. The song was retitled \"What Goes Around... Comes Around\" for its December 19, 2006, release as the third single from FutureSex/LoveSounds. It became Timberlake's third consecutive number-one hit on the Billboard Hot 100.

dbr:What_It_Feels_Like_for_a_Girl	rdf:type	dbo:MusicalWork ;
	dbo:abstract	"\"What It Feels Like for a Girl\" is a song by American singer-songwriter Madonna, taken from her eighth studio album Music (2000). The song was released as the third single from the album on April 17, 2001 by Maverick Records, with two other versions being also released: a dance-remix produced by Above & Beyond and a Spanish version titled \"Lo Que Siente La Mujer\". It was written by Madonna, Guy Sigsworth and David Torn, who was credited later, while production was handled by Madonna, Sigsworth and Mark Stent. Lyrically, it conveys society's double standard toward women, addressing hurtful myths about female inferiority. To emphasize the message, the song opens with a spoken word sample of Charlotte Gainsbourg from the movie The Cement Garden. The song received acclaim from most music critics, who agreed it was a highlight from the album, while also remarking that the song was one of her most mature musical ventures of her career. Commercially, \"What It Feels Like for a Girl\" was successful in most music charts around the world, peaking in the top ten in countries including Australia, Canada, Denmark, Finland, Japan and the United Kingdom. Though it was a more low peak on the US Billboard Hot 100, peaking at number 23, it managed to achieve success on component charts in the United States, topping the US Hot Dance Club Play chart. An accompanying music video for the song was filmed by Madonna's then-husband Guy Ritchie and premiered on March 22, 2001. It features Madonna in a blonde bob wig as she was portraying a reckless woman on a crime spree. The video was criticized for its depiction of violence and abuse, which caused MTV to ban it before 9pm. The single was also released on DVD and VHS containing the music video. The song was used as a video interlude and was performed in Spanish on the Drowned World Tour. The song was also covered by the Fox TV series Glee, which was commercially featured on the episode \"The Power of Madonna\", as well as the following EP."@en ;

A live version of \"Ice Machine\" (recorded during the Some Great Reward tour) is available on the 12\" version of the 1984 single \"Blasphemous Rumours.\" Due to a poor chart placement in the UK (#57), \"Dreaming of Me\" did not originally appear on Speak and Spell, but did show up in the CD re-release as a bonus track.

	dbo:abstract	"\"In My Pocket\" is a song by American recording artist Mandy Moore for her self-titled third studio album. It was released on May 29, 2001, by Epic Records as the lead single from the record. The teen pop song takes influences from pop rock genres and was written by Randall Barlow, Emilio Estefan, Liza Quintana, and Gian Marco Zignago. It was produced by Emilio Estefan Jr. & Randall M. Barlow. \"In My Pocket\" is a dance-pop and teen pop, with a Middle Eastern sound; the song was notably more mature than Moore's past material, and was an entirely different approach for her as an artist at the time. Opening to mixed reviews from music critics, \"In My Pocket\" instantly entered the top 30 in Australia and New Zealand. In the United States, the single received minor success, failing to chart on the Billboard Hot 100. However, it debuted at number two on the chart's extension, Bubbling Under Hot 100 Singles, on June 12, 2001. The song also reached number twenty on the Billboard Pop 100 component chart, where it charted for nine weeks. The music video for \"In My Pocket\" was directed by American director Matthew Rolston, known for directing the Backstreet Boys' \"Shape Of My Heart\" and Janet Jackson's \"Every Time\". His shooting was done in Los Angeles, California, though the video is set in a nightclub in Miami with Middle-Eastern elements. The video and song are notable for portraying an increasingly provocative image, and straying from Moore's bubblegum pop roots."@en ;

In the United States, the single reached No. 56 on the Cash Box Top 100 Singles chart and No. 1 on the Billboard Christmas Singles chart. \"Step into Christmas\" was later included as a bonus track on the 1995 remastered re-issue of the album Caribou, even though it was released in the Goodbye Yellow Brick Road era. It also appears on the albums Elton John's Christmas Party, Rare Masters, To Be Continued, and various Christmas compilation albums. Two versions with different vocals exist. According to liner notes about the song by Elton John and Bernie Taupin (in Rare Masters and Elton John's Christmas Party), the track and its B-side, both produced by Gus Dudgeon, were recorded during a quickie session at Morgan Studios in London, owned by drummer Barry Morgan, who had played on several of Elton's early albums. \"Step into Christmas\" was mixed to sound like one of producer Phil Spector's 1960s recordings, using plenty of compression and imitating his trademark \"wall of sound\" technique. This was intentional according to both John and Taupin, and an homage of sorts to Christmas songs by Spector-produced groups such as The Ronettes. In 2009, \"Step into Christmas\" was the ninth most played Christmas song in the United Kingdom."@en ;

Written by guitarist and vocalist James Mercer, it concerns his hometown of Albuquerque, New Mexico and his experiences there in his late twenties. The lyrics are fueled with \"angst and confusion,\" as Mercer was finding himself constantly depressed and disconnected from his friends and scene. The song attracted attention from Sub Pop Records, who issued the song as a single in February 2001. The buzz created by the song led to positive press for the group's debut album, Oh, Inverted World. The song began to be licensed in a variety of media beginning in 2002, including various television programs and a McDonald's advert that aired during the 2002 Winter Olympics. Although the song never charted on any international charts, it became a sensation following its appearance in the film Garden State (2004), where a character referred to it as a song that \"will change your life.\" The band saw increased record sales and notoriety as a result. Critics were very positive in their assessments of \"New Slang\", with many calling it one of the best songs from Oh, Inverted World.

	dbo:abstract	"\"4 in the Morning\" is a song by American singer and songwriter Gwen Stefani from her second studio album The Sweet Escape (2006). It was written by Stefani and co-written and produced by Tony Kanal, with additional production by Mark \"Spike\" Stent. Interscope Records serviced the song to US mainstream radio on May 8, 2007, as the album's third single; elsewhere it was released in June 2007. Described as one of her favorite songs on the album, Stefani began writing the song while pregnant and finished with Kanal, having Roberta Flack and Billy Idol hits as influences to built the track. \"4 in the Morning\" was defined as a 1980s-inspired midtempo synthpop ballad, with its instrumentation consisting in a light keyboard during its intro through its break, a guitar, synthetic strings and a slick sheen. Lyrically, the song talks about a relationship on the edge, with the protagonist trying to save their love. The song received generally positive reviews from music critics, who noted it as an improvement over her last singles, while praising its tempo and highlighting her vocals. Commercially, it failed to replicate the commercial success of previous singles in the United States, peaking at number 54, however it proved to be successful elsewhere, reaching the top-ten in New Zealand and Australia, while charting inside the top 20 in several European countries. Its accompanying music video was directed by Stefani's longtime collaborator Sophie Muller and features the singer lying in bed and walking around her apartment while performing the song in a melancholic mood. The song was performed during The Sweet Escape Tour and in some concerts Stefani made during 2015."@en ;

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bangla_Desh_(song)>	rdf:type	dbo:MusicalWork ;
	dbo:abstract	"\"Bangla Desh\" is a song by English musician George Harrison. It was released as a non-album single in July 1971, to raise awareness for the millions of refugees from the country formerly known as East Pakistan, following the 1970 Bhola cyclone and the outbreak of the Bangladesh Liberation War. Harrison's inspiration for the song came from his friend Ravi Shankar, a Bengali musician, who approached Harrison for help in trying to alleviate the suffering. \"Bangla Desh\" has been described as \"one of the most cogent social statements in music history\" and helped gain international support for Bangladeshi independence by establishing the name of the fledgling nation around the world. In 2005, United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan identified the song's success in personalising the Bangladesh crisis, through its emotive description of Shankar's request for help. \"Bangla Desh\" appeared at the height of Harrison's popularity as a solo artist, following the break-up of the Beatles and the acclaim afforded his 1970 triple album All Things Must Pass. It was pop music's first charity single, and its release took place three days before the Harrison-sponsored Concert for Bangladesh shows at New York's Madison Square Garden. The single became a top ten hit in the United Kingdom and elsewhere in Europe, and peaked at number 23 on America's Billboard Hot 100. The recording was co-produced by Phil Spector and features contributions from Leon Russell, Jim Horn, Ringo Starr and Jim Keltner. The Los Angeles session for the song marked the start of two enduring musical associations in Harrison's solo career, with Keltner and Horn. Backed by these musicians and others including Eric Clapton and Billy Preston, Harrison performed \"Bangla Desh\" at the UNICEF concerts, on 1 August 1971, as a rousing encore. In a review of the Concert for Bangladesh live album for Rolling Stone magazine, Jon Landau identified this reading as \"the concert's single greatest performance by all concerned\". The studio recording appeared on the 1976 compilation The Best of George Harrison, which remained its only official CD release until September 2014, when it was included as a bonus track on the Apple Years 1968\u201375 reissue of Harrison's Living in the Material World album. Artists who have covered the song include Stu Phillips & the Hollyridge Strings and Italian saxophonist Fausto Papetti."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"Didn't I (Blow Your Mind This Time)\" is a 1969 single by The Delfonics, produced by Thom Bell and released on the Philly Groove record label. The recording is considered one of the most notable early Philly soul singles and is regarded as a classic, winning a Grammy Award for Best R&B Performance by a Duo or Group. Typical of the genre, \"Didn't I\" is a slow love ballad, with layered strings, horns, and chromatic production. Among The Delfonics' signature songs, \"Didn't I (Blow Your Mind This Time)\" was a #3 hit on the Billboard R&B singles chart, #10 on the Billboard pop chart in 1970, and #22 on the UK Singles Chart in 1971. The song has been extensively covered since 1970, with versions by Aretha Franklin (from \"Young, Gifted and Black\" in 1971), brothers David and Jimmy Ruffin, Regina Belle, Jackie Jackson, Millie Jackson, The Trammps, Maxine Nightingale and Patti LaBelle. The song was also featured as a song that actually drives the plot in the motion picture Jackie Brown (Max hears the LP vinyl version for the first time at Jackie's house and they talk about the Delfonics as he gets to know her, then later he buys the cassette version) and was included in its soundtrack. Daryl Hall and Todd Rundgren covered this song in Episode 40 of Live From Daryl's House."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"Wouldn't It Be Nice\" is the opening track on the 1966 album Pet Sounds by the American rock band the Beach Boys. It was composed, arranged, and produced by Brian Wilson with words largely by Tony Asher. After a 1990s court case, an additional credit was awarded to Mike Love for the song's coda's vocal arrangement and lyric. It was released as a single two months after the album's release with \"God Only Knows\" as its B-side. In other countries, the sides were flipped, with \"Wouldn't It Be Nice\" as the single's B-side Its lyrics describe a couple in love lamenting about being too young to run off to get married, fantasizing about how nice it would be if they were adults. Like other tracks for Pet Sounds, Wilson constructed the song's symphonic Wall of Sound arrangement using a variety of instruments not normally associated with popular music of its time, including accordions and a detuned twelve-string guitar. The music contains classical music devices that are unusual for a rock song, such as bitonality and ritardando. After recording the instrumental track, the Beach Boys overdubbed their voices to Wilson's exact specifications. In 2006, Pitchfork Media placed it at number 7 on its list of \"The 200 Greatest Songs of the 1960s\"."@en ;

The lyrics allude to the constellation of Orion, implying that the arms of the figure in the sky are wide enough to hold him and his lover together, although the lovers are far apart.[citation needed] Prince had to surrender all publishing rights to the songs on the Batman album including \"The Arms of Orion\" to Warner Bros. as part of the deal to compose, perform, and produce the soundtrack."@en ;

It was released in the United Kingdom as a CD single on December 8, 2008. Development of \"Rehab\" began while Rihanna was accompanying Timbaland on Justin Timberlake's FutureSex/LoveShow tour in 2007. Timberlake wrote the song in collaboration with his producers, Hannon Lane and Timbaland, and provided additional vocals. \"Rehab\" is a mid-paced R&B song with an emotional, melancholy chorus; the lyrics are about the protagonist's painful memories of her former lover, who is portrayed metaphorically as a disease. Critics were divided on the song's production and composition, some comparing the structure to that of Timberlake's 2007 single \"What Goes Around... Comes Around\". \"Rehab\" reached top-ten positions on the singles charts in Austria, Germany, the Netherlands and Norway. It reached number 16 on the UK Singles Chart and number 18 on the US Billboard magazine's Hot 100. It was certified double platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).

Additional writing and production was done by Kara DioGuardi and Greg Wells, while Lohan recorded the song on her trailer during the shoot of Herbie: Fully Loaded. \"Confessions of a Broken Heart (Daughter to Father)\" was first previewed at AOL Music's First Listen on September 30, 2005 and was sent to radio in the United States on October 18, 2005 by Casablanca Records as the first single from the album. \"Confessions of a Broken Heart (Daughter to Father)\" received mixed reviews from music critics, who praised Lohan's conviction on the song, but considering it a clich\u00E9 \"I-hate-you-Daddy\" lament. The song achieved mild commercial success, peaking at number 7 in Australia, number 74 in Austria, number 14 on the United States Hot Digital Songs, and at number 57 on Billboard Hot 100. An accompanying music video, directed by Lohan herself, portrays the singer and her actual sister, Ali, listening to her parents arguing and fighting in the living room of their home. \"Confessions of a Broken Heart (Daughter to Father)\" was performed by Lohan at the American Music Awards of 2005."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"Beauty Is Only Skin Deep\" is a 1964 song, that became a 1966 hit single recorded by The Temptations for the Gordy (Motown) label. Written by Norman Whitfield and Edward Holland, Jr., and produced by Whitfield, the song was a number three pop hit and a number one R&B hit in the United States. The song's theme is inner beauty, and its value over physical appearance. David Ruffin sings lead on this song, relating the story of a man who's become frustrated with dating pretty women with \"ugly\" attitudes. He now praises his current girl, whom he does not find as physically beautiful, but feels that her personality more than makes up for it. \"She may be fine on the outside/but so untrue on the inside\", is a typical lyric from the song. Norman Whitfield recorded the song's instrumental track in 1964, two years before he got together with Eddie Holland to have lyrics written for the song. Several artists recorded \"Beauty Is Only Skin Deep\" before the Temptations, including David Ruffin's older brother Jimmy Ruffin, and The Miracles, who were actually the first to record it in 1964, but their version was not released as a single. It was later included on their 1966 Away We a Go-Go album. After Whitfield's previous production for the Temptations, \"Ain't Too Proud to Beg\", hit number-one on the Billboard R&B singles chart, he prepared \"Beauty Is Only Skin Deep\" as a showcase for Ruffin and the Temptations. It was chosen as a single by Billie Jean Brown, head of Motown's quality control department. The group appealed the decision to Motown head Berry Gordy, who preferred it to the group's choice. The record proved much more successful than the group members expected: \"Beauty Is Only Skin Deep\" was an R&B number-one hit, the Temptations' fourth, and reached number-three on the Billboard Pop Singles Chart. The song never appeared on a regular Temptations studio LP, but was featured on the group's first Greatest Hits record."@en ;

It was written by Samuel Barnes, Scott LaRock, Makeba Riddick, Jean-Claude Oliver, Lawrence Parker, and produced by Poke & Tone. It was released on September 13, 2005, as the second and final single from the album. The lyrics revolve around \"basically telling a guy, 'If it's lovin' that you want, you should make me your girl because I've got what you need\". The song received mixed reviews from music critics, many of whom praised and criticised Rihanna's vocal performance; its composition was also complimented. \"If It's Lovin' that You Want\" achieved moderate success around the world, reaching the top forty in few European countries, while reaching the top ten in Australia, Ireland and New Zealand. In the United States, the song failed to match the commercial success of Rihanna's previous single, \"Pon de Replay\", peaking at number 36 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. It managed, however, to reach number nine on the Pop Songs chart. The song's accompanying music video, directed by Marcus Raboy, was shot on a beach in California, and features the singer enjoying various activities, such as dancing and riding jet skis with her friends."@en ;

The song (named after the chorus line \"You sexy motherfucker\") caused some controversy, and an edited version, \"Sexy Mutha,\" was created for radio and the music video, as well as the \"clean version\" of the U.S. album. \"Sexy MF\" is a merger of \"old school\" funk with modern R&B music. The song is built around the drums and bass, though the bass-line is somewhat subdued. Added to this is a consistent electric rhythm guitar undertone and horn stabs from the NPG Hornz. Throughout the song, the horns are given the chance to shine, along with a sax solo from Brian Gallagher. Musical solos are also provided by Levi Seacer, Jr. (guitar) and Tommy Barbarella (organ). The music and most of the lyrics were composed by Prince, while Seacer came up with the chorus and the song's title. Tony M. delivers a rap which he wrote. Recently, it has been covered by the Dave Matthews Band as a segue into their hit \"Jimi Thing.\" The song was recorded in Paisley Park Studios' Studio A.

	dbo:abstract	"\"A Pain That I'm Used To\" is the second single and opening track of the album Playing the Angel by Depeche Mode, and the forty-second DM single overall. The single was released on 12 December 2005 by Mute Records. The single contains remixes by UK Mute label mates Goldfrapp, and Jacques Lu Cont (Stuart Price). There are also two radio versions. The first one is only a slight remix, whereas the second contains a completely different, more electronic introduction and instrumentation. Although \"Better Days\" was mentioned to be the B-side for the single in its press release, it ended up being a track called \"Newborn\" when the tracklists were released. \"Better Days\" went on to be the B-side to the following single, \"Suffer Well\". \"Newborn\" is a slow song that transforms into a harder song during the chorus. It is a fan-favourite in terms of B-sides. The single was only physically released in the UK. The US only had a digital release (i.e., iTunes). The song reached number 15 upon UK release. In the US, the song debuted at number 45 on the Hot Dance Music/Club Play chart on 14 January 2006. It eventually reached number 6. The music video is directed by Uwe Flade, who also directed the \"Precious\" single. It features much more live action sequences (in a race track), than the \"Precious\" video and even David Gahan's \"Bottle Living\" video. Depeche Mode's live drummer Christian Eigner also appears in the video. The song was featured on the Bones episode Two Bodies in the Lab. It is also featured in the first trailer for the 2010 film The Sorcerer's Apprentice. The Jacques Lu Cont Remix also appears on the soundtrack to EA Sports' 2006 FIFA World Cup video game."@en ;

dbr:Beat_of_My_Heart	rdf:type	dbo:MusicalWork ;
	dbo:abstract	"\"Beat of My Heart\" is a song recorded by American singer Hilary Duff for her first compilation album, Most Wanted (2005). It was written by Duff and the Dead Executives, a record production team consisting of Jason Epperson, Joel and Benji Madden. Along with the three other new songs on Most Wanted, \"Beat of My Heart\" was crafted with the intention of having a \"totally different sound\" from Duff's previous material. It is an up-tempo new wave-inspired electropop song that incorporates elements of bubblegum pop and dance music in its production. Lyrically, \"Beat of My Heart\" can be interpreted in many different ways. For Duff, it tells the story of a woman \"com[ing] out of her shell again\" after a bad break-up. Following the success of \"Wake Up\", \"Beat of My Heart\" was issued as the second international single from Most Wanted. It was released in Australia by Festival Mushroom Records on December 11, 2005 and in several European countries on March 6, 2006, by Angel Records. The single was a moderate commercial success. It managed to chart in four different countries, reaching its highest position in Italy, where it peaked at number eight. In addition, it reached the top twenty in Australia and Spain and the low-end of the chart in Switzerland. Critical reaction to \"Beat of My Heart\" was generally mixed, with many criticizing the song for being repetitive and childish, while others gave it credit for presenting an easy-to-listen-to sound. The music video for \"Beat of My Heart\" was directed by Phil Harder. The video, which paid homage to bond girls, debuted a \"more mature\" image of Duff. It emulates the title sequences of James Bond films from the 1960s to present-day, high-tech 3D designs. Duff has performed \"Beat of My Heart\" live on all of her concert tours since its inception. A pre-recorded performance of the song was played during the 2006 edition of Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve, which would later become a regular feature during future editions of the program. The song and video were parodied on the American sketchy comedy series Mad TV. The parody satirizes Duff's thinness and Hollywood's obsession with body image."@en ;

It was written by George Harrison with John Lennon, as a parody of the Shadows style. (The Shadows, who backed Cliff Richard, were the biggest British instrumental rock & roll group at the time of the recording.) It imitates the lead guitar with typical Hank Marvin licks, the melodic bass fills, and even has an imitation during the second middle eight of the famous Jet Harris yell. It is the only Beatles track to be credited to Lennon and Harrison alone. It was intended to be released as the B-side of \"Why\", another Sheridan song with the Beatles, but the record company chose to release another song instead. In early 1964, as the Beatles were gaining popularity, the record company Polydor decided to release it, with \"Why\" changed to the b-side. \"Cry for a Shadow\"'s original title was \"Beatle Bop\". \"Cry for a Shadow\" was the only officially released Beatles single to feature Pete Best on drums.

Written and produced by Carey and James \"Big Jim\" Wright, the song is influenced by Gospel, soul, and R&B music genres. Its arrangement is built on piano chords and guitar melodies, and features Carey's pastor Clarence Keaton, who recites two Biblical verses during the song's introduction and bridge. Carey described \"Fly Like a Bird\" as the most personal and religious track from The Emancipation of Mimi, with its lyrics featuring a veritable prayer to God: \"Fly like a bird, take to the sky, I need you now Lord, carry me high!\". At the time of its release, \"Fly Like a Bird\" received acclaim from music critics. While many praised Carey's strong vocal performance throughout its climax, many pinpointed on its lyrical content and compared it to Carey's debut song, \"Vision of Love\". Released as the final single from its parent album, the song was only sent to adult contemporary and gospel radio stations, during the same time \"Say Somethin'\" was commissioned to mainstream channels. Carey performed the song on several high profile industry events, including the 48th annual Grammy Awards, the Shelter from the Storm: A Concert for the Gulf Coast concert charity benefit, and Idol Gives Back.

dbr:I_Hate_U	rdf:type	dbo:MusicalWork ;
	dbo:abstract	"\"I Hate U\" (also spelled \"Eye Hate U\" to reflect the pictograph in the published title) is a song by American musician Prince from his 1995 album The Gold Experience. The track was the lead single in support of the album, released on September 12, 1995. \"I Hate U\" was nearly a solo effort from Prince, although he credited Minneapolis musician Ricky Peterson with co-production and arranging, as well as providing additional keyboards. Beginning with crashing drums, the \"NPG Operator\" welcomes the listener to \"The Hate Experience\" (which Prince would later entitle the song's maxi-single), before leading into the first verse where Prince sings in delicate falsetto about a cheating woman, whom he hates \"like a day without sunshine\". A church-like organ moves the song along, while a musical segment borrowed from \"Baby\" (a track from his 1978 album For You) provides breaks throughout the track. After the second verse and chorus, the song enters a lengthy middle section which is sung/spoken in Prince's normal voice. This section is a \"courtroom drama\" where Prince submits his evidence of his cheating lover to a judge. When he asks the woman to state her name for the court, he interrupts her with a vocal reference from the album's previous track \u2014 \"Billy Jack Bitch\". Toward the end of the drama, he states that being without her is killing him emotionally and that he actually still loves her. After a final chorus, again using an impassioned falsetto, Prince launches into a brief but effective guitar solo which climaxes and ends the song."@en ;

dbr:Kiss_on_My_List	rdf:type	dbo:MusicalWork ;
	dbo:abstract	"\"Kiss on My List\" is a song by the American duo Hall & Oates. It was written by Daryl Hall and Janna Allen, and produced by the duo. It was the third single release from their ninth studio album, Voices (1980), and became their second U.S. Billboard Hot 100 number-one single (after \"Rich Girl\" in 1977). It spent three weeks at the top spot. The song was written with the intention of Janna Allen, sister of Hall's longtime girlfriend Sara Allen, singing it, as she was interested in starting a music career. Hall cut a demo version as a guide for her, but later when his manager found the tape lying around the studio, he insisted that Hall and Oates cut the song themselves. In fact, the production team liked the demo so much that they didn't do a second take, instead adding background vocals and instrumentation to the demo and mixing them together. Hall recalled that's why the drums sounded so \"dinky.\" The song has been widely misinterpreted, with many listeners thinking the lyrics say \"Kiss on my lips.\" Hall calls it an anti-love song, with the song title being tongue-in-cheek sarcasm in that the kiss is not that important, in that it's on a list of other things that are just as important. The song was one of the music videos that aired on MTV's first day of broadcast. While two other songs from the album had returned the duo to chart activity, it was the success of \"Kiss on My List\" that confirmed the start of the duo's sustained run as one of American pop's top-selling acts, a run that lasted into 1990. According to Daryl Hall, Eddie Van Halen copied the synth part of this song and used it for the song \"Jump\" by Van Halen."@en ;

The song was written by Elena Kiper, Ivan Shapovalov, Valeriy Polienko and Sergio Galoyan, while production was handled by Trevor Horn. The song was included in the group's compilation album The Best (2006). The song was released on 5 May 2003 by Interscope Records as the second single off the studio album. Musically, the song is a eurodance-inspired song, and lyrically it talks about the group running away from people as they don't understand their love towards one another. There is also the Russian counterpart entitled \"Nas Ne Dogonyat\". \"Not Gonna Get Us\" received mixed to positive reviews from music critics, praising the production and highlighted the song as an album standout, however some critics were not impressed by the lyrical content. The song was a commercial success worldwide, peaking inside the top ten in countries including Finland, Italy, Austria, Sweden, Belgium, Ireland and the United Kingdom. The song also peaked at number one on the US Hot Dance Club Songs, becoming the group's only number one single in the US component charts. An accompanying music video was shot for the single, where it starts with the girls getting a mugshot, until escaping to a truck, where they drive off through snow in Siberia. The song was shot by Ivan Shapovalov, who also features in a cameo appearance in the song as a construction worker. The song also received a minor controversial image, where it featured a more rebel image. The song has also been performed on all of the group's concert tours, and was also performed at the MTV Movie Awards in 2003. In 2009, t.A.T.u. played a special concert featuring the song at the Eurovision Song Contest with a Russian Army Choir, the Alexandrov Ensemble."@en .

	dbo:abstract	"\"Rock and Roll All Nite\" is a song by Kiss, originally released on their 1975 album Dressed to Kill. It was released as the A-side of their fifth single, with the album track \"Getaway.\" The studio version of the song peaked at No. 68 on the Billboard singles chart, besting the band's previous charting single, \"Kissin' Time\" (#89). A subsequent live version, released as a single in October 1975, eventually reached No. 12 in early 1976, the first of six Top 20 songs for Kiss in the 1970s. \"Rock and Roll All Nite\" became Kiss's most identifiable song and has served as the group's closing concert number in almost every concert since 1976. In 2008 it was named the 16th greatest hard rock song of all time by VH1. The members of Kiss were under intense pressure to put together their third album, 1975's Dressed to Kill. They were abruptly called off tour to work on a follow-up to 1974's Hotter Than Hell when the album began to die on the charts, even though they had no new songs ready. The sessions were being produced by the head of their label, Neil Bogart, who was upset that the band had yet to successfully capture the excitement of their live act on record and wanted to correct the problem himself. Rushed to come up with material, the band dipped into their backlog of older songs, as well as writing new ones and then recording them immediately. Bogart suggested that head songwriters Paul Stanley and Gene Simmons come up with an anthem that would serve as a rallying cry for Kiss and their fans, suggesting something akin to Sly & the Family Stone's \"I Want to Take You Higher.\" While writing back at the hotel, Stanley came up with the line \"I want to rock and roll all night, and party every day.\" After showing the new line to Simmons, he added parts from an older song, reportedly titled \"Drive Me Wild.\"[citation needed] When the song was issued as a single a few months later, it did not storm up the charts. With record label Casablanca in deep financial trouble, Kiss was thinking of leaving for another label, but decided to issue a live album, Alive!, later in 1975. The live version of the song was longer than the studio take (including an Ace Frehley guitar solo that was absent from the original), but, as Bogart hoped, it became a number 12 hit, driving straight up the charts the album from which it was taken."@en ;

The song proved as successful as the band's previous hits, \"This Love\" and \"Harder to Breathe\", hitting number 1 on the Mainstream Top 40 and Adult Top 40 charts, but it prompted many alternative radio outlets to remove Maroon 5 from their playlists, on the ground that the band's newer songs were too light for alt-rock audiences. These stations continued to play \"Harder to Breathe\" and \"This Love\", but Maroon 5's newer hits were played only on pop and adult contemporary stations. As of June 2014, the song has sold over 3,000,000 copies in the US."@en ;

The lyrics of the song refer to apartheid in Africa and explain the bit of the middle of the song, sung in Kiswahili that, while imperfect, still makes sense in the context of the song:Lala pamoja na mimi / Nyumbani yako, nyumbani yako / Sababu wewe hapana kaa na mimi / Nyumbani yako, nyumbani yakoThe rough translation of these lyrics is \"Sleep (together) with me / At your place [house], at your place / Why don't you stay with me / At your place, at your place.\" The single's B-side is a rendition of \"In the Hall of the Mountain King\", a piece taken from Grieg's Peer Gynt suite."@en ;

It also reached #7 in both the U.S. (where it was certified Gold) and Canada, making it Summer's first transatlantic hit since 1979. It was her 14th and final US Top 10 hit. It was also the last Top 40 hit of Summer's career. This was Summer's first U.S. single to be released on Atlantic Records, a division of Warner Bros. Records. Since 1980 she had been signed to Geffen (also a division of Warner Bros.) but her work across Europe had always been distributed by Warner Bros.' main label. This would continue to be the case following her signing to Atlantic. The video was directed by Dieter Trattmann."@en ;

In 2008, the song won the award for the Popjustice \u00A320 Music Prize, an annual prize awarded by a panel of judges organised by music website Popjustice to the singer(s) of the best British pop single of the past year. \"Call the Shots\" proved to be commercially successful upon its release, charting at number three on the UK Singles Chart, continuing the band's string of hits by becoming their sixteenth consecutive single to chart within the top ten, and being later certified Silver by the British Phonographic Industry. The song also peaked at number nine on the Irish Singles Chart. The accompanying music video was directed by Sean de Sparengo, and features the girls in purple dresses performing on Malibu Beach at night with flames and white fabric surrounding them.

	dbo:abstract	"\"Taking Chances\" is a song recorded by Canadian recording artist Celine Dion, taken from her ninth English studio album of the same name (2007). It was written by songwriter Kara DioGuardi and former Eurythmics member Dave Stewart for their band named Platinum Weird. It was supposed to be released as a single in February 2007 for their unreleased self-titled album. However, after DioGuardi and Stewart recorded the song, they played it for Dion's husband Ren\u00E9 Ang\u00E9lil, who loved it and Dion recorded it. It was released as the first single from Taking Chances in September 2007. \"Taking Chances\" is a pop rock ballad, which begins with Dion crooning softly over a near-acoustic musical backdrop, before the soft rock bombast kicks in. Lyrically, it is about trusting and baring our souls to each other and committing to making something special. The line, \"So talk to me, like lovers do\" came from the Eurythmics song \"Here Comes the Rain Again.\" The song received positive reviews from music critics, who praised Dion for taking risks and called it a hopeful and heartfelt song. The song was a success around the world, peaking inside the top ten in Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France, Italy and Switzerland. It also peaked at number 40 on the UK Singles Chart, while on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, it reached number 54. It also topped the Hot Dance Club Play chart. The song was nominated for the Single of the Year at the Juno Awards of 2009. \"Taking Chances\" was covered on Fox's hit TV show Glee by Lea Michele's character Rachel Berry. Her version peaked at number 71 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"Dogs\" is a UK single released by The Who in June 1968. It reached number 25 on the UK singles chart. The B-side of the UK single was \"Call Me Lightning\". Both songs were originally released mixed in mono only, as they were not originally intended for album release. The lyrics of \"Dogs\" were inspired by Townshend's friend Chris Morphet who had a fascination with greyhound racing. Morphet contributes harmonica and backing vocals. It was recorded at London's Advision Studios in May 1968. Townshend booked this studio as it was the first in the UK to install professional reel-to-reel eight-track equipment. Prior to this The Who had only used recorders with a maximum of four tracks. The song was not a major commercial success at the time of its release, perhaps because of its rather bizarre and campy style. Entwistle later said that it sounded much more like the Small Faces and suggested that it would have perhaps been better for both groups if they had recorded it instead. Pete said in the notes to the 1974 LP Odds & Sods that this was one of the songs recorded during a period when the group went \"slightly mad.\" The song contains both singing and spoken sections and has vocal contributions from three members of the group, Roger, Pete and John. It includes the memorable closing phrase, \"Nice dog, yes, lovely form, lovely buttocks\", spoken by Pete. A subsequent song \"Dogs (Part Two)\" was later released as the B-side of \"Pinball Wizard\" in 1969. Despite the similar titles the two songs are musically unrelated. \"Dogs (Part Two)\" is an instrumental credited to Keith Moon. Both \"Dogs\" songs were included on the 1987 U.S. collection Two's Missing. That album is out of print, but \"Dogs\" is still available in a 1990s era stereo remix on the box set 30 Years of Maximum R&B; a stereo mix of \"Dogs (Part Two)\" was included on the bonus disc of the Tommy deluxe edition in 2003."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"Don't Give Up\" is a song written by English rock musician Peter Gabriel and recorded as a duet with Kate Bush for Gabriel's album So. The single version was released as the second single from the album in the UK in 1986 and fifth in the United States in 1987. It spent eleven weeks in the UK Top 75 chart in 1986, peaking at number nine. The song was inspired by the Depression-era photographs of Dorothea Lange, showing poverty-stricken Americans in dust bowl conditions. Gabriel saw Lange's images in a 1973 book titled In This Proud Land. He felt that a song based on this was wholly appropriate to difficult economic conditions in England under Margaret Thatcher. He composed lyrics within a situation about a man whose unemployment causes stress in his domestic relationship. The verses, sung by Gabriel, describe the man's feelings of isolation and despair; the choruses, sung by Bush, offer words of hope and encouragement. Gabriel originally wrote the song from a reference point of American roots music and he approached country singer Dolly Parton to sing it with him. However, Parton turned it down, so his friend Kate Bush took her place. Two videos were created for the song. The first, by Godley & Creme, consisted of a single take of the singers in an embrace, as the sun enters total eclipse and re-emerges; the second, by Jim Blashfield, featured Gabriel and Bush's faces superimposed over film of a town and its people in disrepair."@en ;

It was produced by Rodney \"Darkchild\" Jerkins and Beyonc\u00E9 for her second solo album, B'Day (2006). \"D\u00E9j\u00E0 Vu\" is an R&B song, which incorporates elements of the 1970s funk and soul music. Its music is largely based on live instrumentation, including bass guitar, hi-hat, horns, except Roland TR-808 drum machine, which is a non-live instrument. The song's title and lyrics refer to a woman being constantly reminded of a past lover. \"D\u00E9j\u00E0 Vu\" was released as the album's lead single to US radios on June 24, 2006. The song received generally mixed critical reviews. Many critics noted the similarities of \"D\u00E9j\u00E0 Vu\" with Beyonc\u00E9's own 2003 song \"Crazy in Love\". Critics commended the assertiveness and the sensuality with which Beyonc\u00E9 sings the lyrics and compared her vocal delivery to that of Tina Turner in the late 1980s. \"D\u00E9j\u00E0 Vu\" and its Freemasons club remix version received three nominations at Best Remixed Recording, Non-Classical at the 2007 Grammy Awards. It was recognized as the Best Song of 2006 at the Music of Black Origin (MOBO) Awards. Commercially, \"D\u00E9j\u00E0 Vu\" peaked at number four on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart.

The song was written solely by Madonna, while the production was handled by John \"Jellybean\" Benitez at her request. It was released as the second single from the film's soundtrack album on October 3, 1985, by Geffen Records. \"Gambler\" was never released in the United States, at the request of Madonna's own Sire Records. The music video of the song is an excerpt from the film. Musically, \"Gambler\" is an upbeat synthpop and disco song, featuring instrumentation from drums, electronic handclaps and percussion, which is accompanied by a bass synth and keyboards. The lyrics talk about Madonna asserting her self-independence. Critics gave a mixed review of the song, but it was commercially successful, reaching the top-ten in the charts of Australia, Belgium, Ireland, Italy, Netherlands, Norway and the United Kingdom. Madonna has performed the song only once, on her 1985 The Virgin Tour, which was documented on the live video release Madonna Live: The Virgin Tour."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"Instant Karma!\" \u2013 sometimes referred to as \"Instant Karma! (We All Shine On)\" \u2013 is a song written by English musician John Lennon, released as a single on Apple Records in February 1970. In the UK, the single was credited to \"Lennon/Ono with the Plastic Ono Band\". The song reached the top five in the British and American singles charts, competing with the Beatles' \"Let It Be\" in America, where it became the first solo single by a member of the band to sell a million copies. \"Instant Karma!\" was written, recorded and released within a period of ten days, making it one of the fastest-released songs in pop music history. The recording was produced by Phil Spector, marking a comeback for the American producer after his self-imposed retirement in 1966, and leading to him being offered the producer's role on the Beatles' Let It Be album (1970). Recorded at London's Abbey Road Studios, \"Instant Karma!\" employs Spector's signature Wall of Sound technique and features contributions from George Harrison, Klaus Voormann, Alan White and Billy Preston. The B-side was a song composed and performed by Yoko Ono, titled \"Who Has Seen the Wind?\" Recently shorn of the long hair synonymous with their 1969 campaign for world peace, Lennon and Ono promoted the single with an appearance on Britain's Top of the Pops. \"Instant Karma!\" has appeared on many Lennon compilations, including Shaved Fish (1975), Lennon Legend (1997) and Power to the People: The Hits (2010). A version recorded at the \"One to One\" concerts in August 1972 was included on his posthumously released Live in New York City album (1986). The song continues to receive critical praise as one of the finest recordings from Lennon's solo career. Paul Weller, Duran Duran and U2 are among the acts who have covered \"Instant Karma!\", the chorus of which inspired the title to Stephen King's 1977 novel The Shining."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"Jump\" is a song by American singer Madonna from her tenth studio album Confessions on a Dance Floor (2005). Written by Madonna, Stuart Price and Joe Henry, the song was supposed to be released as the third single of the album. However, since \"Get Together\" was decided as the third single, \"Jump\" was released as the fourth and final single from the album, on October 31, 2006 by Warner Bros. Records. The song incorporates techno music with tributes to Pet Shop Boys. Madonna sings in her lower register in the song. Its lyrics talk about self-empowerment and sufficiency while looking for the prospects of a new relationship. Contemporary critics complimented the song and its empowerment theme. They compared it to Madonna's '80s music and praised the club-anthem like quality of the song. The song peaked inside the top ten of the charts of some European countries, while peaking the charts in Italy and Hungary. In the United States, \"Jump\" placed in several Billboard dance charts and became one of the most popular dance hits of the decade. The accompanying music video was shot in Tokyo during Madonna's 2006 Confessions Tour stopover. It portrayed Madonna in a blond bob wig and a leather ensemble singing the song in front of a number of neon signs. The video also featured dancers who performed the physical discipline parkour. It was also incorporated in her Confessions Tour, where Madonna and her dancers jumped around the stage actively, while singing the song. The song was used in the movie The Devil Wears Prada (2005) and the Ugly Betty season 2 finale."@en ;

It was released on December 2, 2000 by Epic Records as the lead single from the album. The song was written by Damon Sharpe, Georgette Franklin, Jeremy Monroe, Amille D. Harris, and Greg Lawson, and was produced by Ric Wake, Richie Jones, and Cory Rooney. At the time of the song's release, Lopez was transitioning into a sex symbol and in a relationship with American rapper Sean Combs. Lyrically, \"Love Don't Cost a Thing\" is described as an \"exploration of love\" in which Lopez is unhappy about her materialistic lover; provoking much media analysis as to whether or not it was an innuendo towards Combs. Ultimately, the pair's courtship ended shortly after its release. Described as \"frothy\" and \"catchy\" by critics, it was noted for its message about love and commercial appeal to women. \"Love Don't Cost a Thing\" was met with worldwide commercial success, and is considered \"classic Lopez\". It peaked within the top ten in the United States and foreign markets including Australia, France, Germany and Ireland, as well as peaking at number one in Canada, New Zealand and the United Kingdom, among other countries. \"Love Don't Cost a Thing\" was also a radio hit, becoming her first single to top the American Hot 100 airplay chart. The music video for \"Love Don't Cost a Thing\" directed by Paul Hunter and choreographed by Darrin Dewitt Henson was met with acclaim, garnering MTV Video Music Award and ALMA Award nominations. It became one of the year's most-viewed clips, and was highly requested on the music video broadcasting series, Total Request Live. The music video subsequently became notorious after Lopez married Cris Judd, one of the back-up dancers who appeared in it. Lopez has performed \"Love Don't Cost a Thing\" live on numerous occasions, including the 2000 MTV Europe Music Awards and the 2001 MTV Video Music Awards in New York City, held days before 9/11."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"Nasty Girl\" is a song by rapper The Notorious B.I.G. It was released in 2005 in the US and on January 16, 2006 in the UK. The single reached #1 in the United Kingdom (this being his first #1 in the country, just under a year after \"rival\" rapper 2Pac had also achieved his first #1 there also with \"Ghetto Gospel\"). The song features guest appearances from Jagged Edge, P. Diddy, Avery Storm, and Nelly and the video also contains guest appearances from Pharrell, Usher, Fat Joe, 8 Ball & MJG, Teairra Mari, Jazze Pha, DJ Green Lantern, Naomi Campbell and Memphis Bleek. It can be found on the album Duets: The Final Chapter, a remixed album of Biggie Smalls' work. The lyrical section rapped by Notorious B.I.G is actually lifted from another of his songs called \"Nasty Boy\", featured on from his second album Life After Death. Despite this, the production to the song \"Nasty Boy\" is completely different from that for \"Nasty Girl\", and apart from the lyrical sample, and the second verse (rapped by P. Diddy) rapped in the style of Biggie's second verse of Nasty Boy, the two songs bear no similarities. The chorus, sung by Jagged Edge, which has the line \"Grab your titties for B.I.G.\", references \"Player's Anthem\", which he says \"Bitches, rub your titties if you love Big Poppa\". The Notorious B.I.G. claimed that he was recording \"Nasty Boy\" when Tupac Shakur was shot in Las Vegas on September 7, 1996. Instead of traveling to Las Vegas for the Mike Tyson and Bruce Seldon fight, he recorded his verse in the morning and saw the fight at home. A slightly different version of the single also appeared on Nelly's Sweatsuit album. \"Nasty Girl\" was used as the opening theme for Germany's Next Topmodel, Cycle 1. \"Nasty Girl\" samples Eumir Deodato's song \"Skatin'\"."@en .

	dbo:abstract	"\"Never Again\" is a song recorded by American pop singer Kelly Clarkson for her third studio album, My December (2007). Clarkson co-wrote the song with Jimmy Messer while produced by American producer and musician David Kahne. Clarkson stated that the song was written as a counterpart to the songs from her second studio album, Breakaway (2004), and was almost removed because of its harsh lyrical nature. RCA Records serviced the song to mainstream radios in the United States on April 24, 2007. \"Never Again\" features a stronger rock sound than Clarkson's previous releases, but maintains some pop undertones. It relies on strings, guitar riffs and drums and is centered on angry, abrasive lyrics. \"Never Again\" received positive reviews from music critics, with many citing it as a darker counterpart to \"Since U Been Gone\" (2004) and as one of her best releases. The song fared well in international as well as domestic markets, but failed to mimic the success of her previous lead singles. It peaked at number eight on the Billboard Hot 100 and was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). It was also certified gold in Canada and Australia while peaking within the top ten in both regions. The song has sold over one million downloads in the United States. The accompanying music video for \"Never Again\" was released on May 1, 2007 in the United States. It portrays Clarkson being drowned in a bathtub and in various scenes acting as a ghost, haunting her ex-boyfriend following the end of their relationship."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"One Step Beyond\" is a tune written by Jamaican ska singer Prince Buster as a B-side for his single \"Al Capone\". It was made famous by British band Madness who covered it for their debut 1979 album, One Step Beyond..., also named after the song. Although Buster's version was mostly instrumental except for the song title shouted for a few times, the Madness version features a spoken intro by Chas Smash and a barely audible but insistent background chant of \"here we go!\". The spoken line, \"Don't watch that, watch this\", in the intro is from another Prince Buster song, \"The Scorcher\". Also, that line became a trademark during the early promos of MTV, where the video was in heavy rotation. According to Alan Winstanley, one of the producers, the released Madness version was a rough mix, created by taking the original 1 minute 10 second instrumental and repeating it, with the second half treated with an Eventide harmonizer to make it sound slightly different. Langer and Winstanley intended to do a full remix but found that the double-length rough mix had already been sent for mastering before they got the opportunity. The song is often used to begin live performances by the band."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"The Pleasure Principle\" is a song by American singer-songwriter Janet Jackson, recorded for her third studio album, Control (1986). It was written by and produced by Monte Moir, and was released as the sixth single from the album on May 12, 1987 by A&M Records. \"The Pleasure Principle\" is an \"independent woman\" anthem about love gone wrong built around a dance beat. The photo for the single cover was shot by fashion photographer David LaChapelle. The accompanying music video for \"The Pleasure Principle\" was directed by Dominic Sena. It depicts Jackson entering a loft wearing only a t-shirt and jeans to practice her dancing. The video was seen by critics as iconic, and was nominated at two categories at the 1988 MTV Video Music Awards, eventually winning one. \"The Pleasure Principle\" was performed on many of Jackson's tours, most recently on her 2011 Number Ones: Up Close and Personal tour. The song was also performed on some promotional appearances, including at the 2006 Billboard Music Awards. In 2008, Jackson's lingerie line was named after the song. It has been included in two of Jackson's greatest hits albums, Design of a Decade: 1986\u20131996 (1995) and Number Ones (2009)."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"Tonight, Tonight, Tonight\" is the second track on the 1986 album Invisible Touch by Genesis. It peaked at No. 3 in the U.S. and No. 18 in the UK as the fourth single from the album. The working title was \"Monkey, Zulu\". The single included an edited version (at 4:32) and the first part of \"Domino\" (\"In the Glow of the Night\") as the B-side. A new edit of the single version was released on the 1999 compilation Turn It On Again: The Hits (as well as its \"sequel\" The Tour Edition) and later on The Platinum Collection. This revised edit features a different cross fade and different edit points as compared to the original 1987 edit version. Some singles that included the full version of the song included the second part of \"Domino\" (\"The Last Domino\") as the B-side. Other releases contained the song \"Paperlate\" and a 12\" remix of \"Tonight, Tonight, Tonight\". The full live version from the Live at Wembley Stadium video was included as a B-side on the \"Tell Me Why\" CD single. The song was performed during concerts in support of Invisible Touch. A shorter version (which segued into \"Invisible Touch\") was played on the We Can't Dance and Turn It On Again tours, albeit transposed down a key to account for the deepening of Phil Collins' voice."@en ;

The song was the only single released worldwide by Lauper that did not have a music video. It peaked at number five on the Billboard Hot 100, becoming Lauper's fourth top five single in the U.S. Lauper became the first woman in the 26-year history of Billboard to take four singles from the same album to Top 5 on the Hot 100.

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Angie_(song)>	rdf:type	dbo:MusicalWork ;
	dbo:abstract	"\"Angie\" is a song by the rock band The Rolling Stones, featured on their 1973 album Goats Head Soup. Written by Mick Jagger and Keith Richards and recorded in November and December 1972, \"Angie\" is an acoustic-guitar-driven ballad which tells of the end of a romance. The song's distinctive piano accompaniment was played by Nicky Hopkins, a Rolling Stones recording-session regular. The strings on the piece (as well as on another song, \"Winter\") were arranged by Nicky Harrison. An unusual feature of the original recording is that singer Mick Jagger's vocal guide track (made before the final vocals were performed) is faintly audible throughout the song (an effect sometimes called a \"ghost vocal\"). Released as a single in August 1973, \"Angie\" went straight to the top of the US Billboard Hot 100 and reached No. 5 on the UK singles chart. The song was also a No. 1 hit in both Canada and Australia for five weeks each and topped the charts in many countries throughout Europe and the rest of the world. Because of the song's length, some radio stations made edits to shorten it to 3 minutes, omitting the longer coda and the second instrumental section of the song. There was speculation that the song was about David Bowie's first wife Angela, the actress Angie Dickinson, Keith Richards' newborn daughter Dandelion Angela, and others. In 1993, in an interview for the liner notes to the Rolling Stones' compilation album Jump Back: The Best of The Rolling Stones, Richards said that the title was inspired by his baby daughter. However, in his 2010 memoir Life, Richards said that he had chosen the name at random when writing the song \u2014 before he knew that his baby would be named Angela or even knew that his baby would be a girl \u2014 and that the song \"was not about any particular person.\" According to NME, Jagger's contributions to the lyrics referred to his breakup with Marianne Faithfull. The Rolling Stones have frequently performed the song in concert; it was included in set lists on their 1973, 1975, and 1976 tours, and they have performed it on every tour since their 1982 European tour. Concert renditions were released on the albums Stripped and Live Licks. In the documentary Protagonist, the former German terrorist Hans-Joachim Klein remarks that the song inspired him to adopt \"Angie\" as the moniker he used during his militant activities in the 1970s. In 2005, the German political party CDU used the song in its election campaign for Angela Merkel, although the Rolling Stones had not given them permission to do so."@en ;

As well as its musical qualities, it is noted for its innovative video, directed by Bowie and David Mallet. The lyrics revisit Bowie's Major Tom character from 1969's \"Space Oddity\" in a darker theme, which he referenced once again in 1995 with \"Hallo Spaceboy\". The song's original title was \"People Are Turning to Gold.\" Interviewed in 1980, Bowie described the song as a \"nursery rhyme\": \"It's very much a 1980s nursery rhyme. I think 1980s nursery rhymes will have a lot to do with the 1880s/1890s nursery rhymes which are all rather horrid and had little boys with their ears being cut off and stuff like that\". Years later, Bowie said that with \"Ashes to Ashes\" he was \"wrapping up the seventies really\" for himself, which \"seemed a good enough epitaph for it\". AllMusic critic Dave Thompson described the track and its the accompanying music video as \"a very deliberate acknowledgement of the then-burgeoning new romantic scene.\""@en ;

Jackson said that the song's lyrics were not a reference to sex, but could be about whatever people wanted them to be about. \"Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough\" was Jackson's first single to hit #1 on the United States Billboard Hot 100 chart in seven years, and his first solo #1 on the Soul singles chart. It remained at #1 for six weeks on Billboard's Soul chart. The song was a worldwide success. Within a few months of release, the 45 was certified Gold, and eventually earned a Platinum certification for sales in excess of two million US copies. \"Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough\" was well received by contemporary music critics. An accompanying music video for the song was released in October 1979. The video shows Jackson dancing, as well as being shown in a triplicate, in different color backgrounds. The song also won Jackson his first solo Grammy and American Music Awards. \"Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough\" is considered to be the first song to showcase Jackson's talent as a solo artist, both as a singer and songwriter.

The song is memorable for the line \"Hello, is it me you're looking for?\". That phrase started the song's composition, as James Anthony Carmichael visited Richie, and once the singer greeted him that way Carmichael replied \"Finish that song.\" Richie initially felt that the song was \"corny\" but ultimately \"by the time I finished the verse, I fell in love with the song again.\" The guitar solo on the song was played by session guitarist Louie Shelton."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"I'm Real\" is the name of two songs recorded by Jennifer Lopez, both primarily for her second studio album, J.Lo (2001). The original version was released as the album's fourth single; Ja Rule of The Inc. Records (formerly known as Murder Inc. Records) wrote and was featured on a new version of the song, entitled \"I'm Real (Murder Remix)\", which was featured on a reissue of J.Lo in July 2001, on Lopez's remix album, J to tha L\u2013O! The Remixes (2002), and Ja Rule's third studio album, Pain Is Love (2001). The original pop and R&B version was well received by music critics who complimented the '80s style, while the remix received mixed reviews for the lyrics. However, both songs have been appreciated for the use of the samples. Singer Ashanti (also on The Inc.) provided backing vocals on the Murder Remix. The \"Murder Inc. Remix\" topped the Billboard Hot 100 for five non-consecutive weeks, beginning September 8, 2001, and also topped the Hot 100 Airplay chart. The two songs are essentially different songs with the same title. Much controversy followed the song after its release. Two music videos were made for the track, with the first depicting Lopez driving a motorcycle throughout the highway and featuring a dance-break, while the second video features Ja Rule and Irv Gotti."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"I'm with Stupid\" is a song by British synthpop band Pet Shop Boys and is featured on their 2006 album, Fundamental. It was released 8 May 2006 as the lead single from the album in the United Kingdom and the rest of the European Union (see 2006 in British music). It became the duo's 21st Top 10 single in the UK, peaking at #8. Though ostensibly about a romantic relationship with a man perceived by the public as a \"moron\", the song has been acknowledged as being, on another level, about Tony Blair's beleaguered relationship with George W. Bush. The protagonist of the song is eventually brought to wonder if the other's stupidity might not be a front: (See also special relationship as a term in international relations.) It received its official first play 31 March on BBC Radio 2 and charted at number eight in the UK Singles Chart, becoming the duo's twenty-first UK top ten single. One of the single's B-sides, \"The Resurrectionist\", is about body-snatching in the English Regency era, carried out by people literally called \"resurrectionists\". \"I'm with Stupid\" was performed on the 23 April 2006 episode of Top of the Pops, in the latest in a long series of Pet Shop Boys performances on the UK music programme. The performance was planned to include six dancers, wearing masks depicting Blair's and Bush's faces. The BBC's editorial department objected, however, citing the need to be politically \"impartial\"; in the end, only one Blair mask and one Bush mask was used, with the remaining four masks replaced by ones depicting Bill Clinton, David Cameron, Menzies Campbell, and Vladimir Putin.The song was later performed in Germany in the form the BBC had objected to. Remixers of the single include Melnyk, Max Tundra, Abe Duque and Pet Shop Boys themselves. Several of the official remixes were not released on physical media at all, being exclusively available on iTunes Music Store and other online music stores. In addition, the single has yet to be released in any form in the United States."@en ;

Evans was an up-and-coming R&B artist at the time. The remix, produced by the Trackmasters samples DeBarge's 1983 song \"Stay with Me\". The song peaked at #2 on the Billboard Hot 100 and topped the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart. It was the highest debuting single of all time, tying with Michael Jackson and Janet Jackson song \"Scream\" when it entered the Hot 100 at #5 at the time. It remained the highest debuting single for a rap song on the Hot 100 until Puff Daddy's tribute song \"I'll Be Missing You\" debuted at #1. (Lauryn Hill and Eminem would later equal this feat, with the former's \"Doo Wop (That Thing)\" entering in the top spot in 1998 and the latter with \"Not Afraid\" in 2010.)"@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"Someday (I Will Understand)\" is a song recorded by American singer Britney Spears. It was written by Spears and produced by Guy Sigsworth. The song was released on August 18, 2005, by Jive Records, as the sole single from Spears' first extended play, Britney & Kevin: Chaotic (2005). In July 2004, Spears announced her engagement to American dancer Kevin Federline, later revealing she would be taking another career break to start a family. Spears wrote the song two weeks before knowing she was pregnant with her first child, Sean Preston Federline. A pop ballad, \"Someday (I Will Understand)\" lyrics refer to a feeling of empowerment as a pregnant woman. A remixed version of the song was included on the 2005 remix compilation, B in the Mix: The Remixes. \"Someday (I Will Understand)\" has received mixed reviews from music critics. A few reviewers considered it as a lesson on the singer's history and a \"tear-jerker\" ballad, while others considered it a non-savable \"flop single\". The song reached the top ten in Denmark, Sweden and Switzerland and also charted in a number of European countries. An accompanying music video, directed by Michael Haussman, premiered on the finale of Britney & Kevin: Chaotic. Entirely shot in black-and-white, the music video features Spears as a pregnant woman and portrays a transformation of her character. Contemporary critics noted the video as a departure from Spears' previous music videos, while comparing the imagery of it to American entertainer Madonna's Kabbalah makeover."@en ;

It was written and produced by Christian Karlsson and Pontus Winnberg (known collectively as Bloodshy & Avant), with additional writing from Cathy Dennis and Henrik Jonback. The song released on January 13, 2004, by Jive Records, as the second single from the album. After trying to choose between \"(I Got That) Boom Boom\" and \"Outrageous\" to be the second single from In the Zone, Spears selected \"Toxic\" instead. A dance-pop song with electropop influences, \"Toxic\" features varied instrumentation, such as drums, synthesizers and surf guitar. It is accompanied by high-pitched Bollywood strings and breathy vocals. Its lyrics draw an extended metaphor of a lover as a dangerous yet addictive drug. The song has received critical acclaim by music critics, who deemed it as the strongest track of In the Zone and praised its hook and chorus. \"Toxic\" attained worldwide success, reaching the top-five in 15 countries, while topping the charts in Australia, Canada, Hungary, Ireland, Norway and the United Kingdom. In the United States, it became her fourth Top 10 single. The accompanying music video for the song was directed by Joseph Kahn and features references to Blade Runner, The Seven Year Itch and the films of John Woo. It portrays Spears as a secret agent in the search of a vial of green liquid. After she steals it, she enters an apartment and poisons her unfaithful boyfriend. The video also includes interspersed scenes of Spears naked with diamonds on her body. After Janet Jackson's Super Bowl incident, the video was considered too racy for MTV and was moved to late-night programming. Spears has performed \"Toxic\" in a number of live appearances, including the 2004 NRJ Music Awards and in three of her concert tours. It was the opening number of The Onyx Hotel Tour (2004), where she sang atop of a bus wearing a black catsuit; Spears also performed remixed versions of the song at The Circus Starring Britney Spears (2009), the Femme Fatale Tour (2011) and Britney: Piece of Me (2013). \"Toxic\" has been covered by artists such as Mark Ronson, A Static Lullaby, Reece Mastin and Ingrid Michaelson, and in television series Glee. The song has also appeared in feature films such as Knocked Up, You Again and television series Doctor Who. \"Toxic\" won Spears her first Grammy at the 2005 ceremony in the category of Best Dance Recording, while gaining her credibility amongst critics. The song has been included in lists by Pitchfork, NME and Rolling Stone as one of the best songs of the decade."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"Un-Break My Heart\" is a song performed by American recording artist Toni Braxton, taken from her second studio album, Secrets (1996). The ballad was written by Diane Warren. Braxton expressed a dislike for the song; however, L.A. Reid was able to convince the singer to record it and include on her album. It was released as the second single from the album in October 1996, through LaFace Records. Lyrically, the song alludes to a \"blistering heartbreak\" in which Braxton begs a former lover to return and undo the pain he has caused. It won a Grammy Award for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance in 1997. \"Un-Break My Heart\" attained commercial success worldwide. In the United States, the song reached number one on the Billboard Hot 100, where it stayed a total of eleven weeks, while reaching the same position on the Hot Dance Club Songs and Adult Contemporary component charts. When Billboard celebrated their 40 years charting from 1958 to 1998, the song was declared as the most successful song by a solo artist in the Billboard Hot 100 history. In Europe, the song reached the top five in more than ten countries while peaking at number one in Austria, Belgium (Wallonia), Sweden, and Switzerland. Bille Woodruff directed the accompanying video for the single. It portrays Braxton mourning the death of her lover, while remembering the good times they had together.

It was written by Hamasaki and produced by Max Matsuura. The song is a dance with elements of trance music. Like majority of the tracks from the album, \"Whatever\" was written in third person narrative, and all lyrically deal with themes of loneliness, chaos, confusion, and the burden of her responsibilities, aimed mostly towards her public image as an recording artist. It was released as the lead single from the album on 10 February 1999 by Avex Trax and Avex Taiwan. Critical reception towards \"Whatever\" has been mixed; while critics commended Hamasaki's music change to dance music and the songs arrangement, \"Whatever\" was criticized for Hamasaki's vocal delivery and song writing. In Japan, \"Whatever\" became her single to reach the top five on the Oricon Singles Chart, peaking at number five. \"Whatever\" also reached number five on the Japanese Count Down TV chart. \"Whatever\" was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of Japan (RIAJ) for shipments of 200,000 units. The accompanying music video was directed by Wataru Takeishi, featuring Hamasaki in a room flowing with water. A child with angel wings and dreads is seen walking around a destroyed town, with scene of Hamasaki taking the place of the child's position. \"Whatever\" has been included on several concert tours and New Year Countdown shows held and hosted by Hamasaki, and has featured on one of her greatest hits compilations."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"When I Grow Up\" is a song by American girl group The Pussycat Dolls from their second and final studio album Doll Domination (2008). It was released by Interscope Records on June 3, 2008, as the lead single from the album. \"When I Grow Up\" was their first single following the departure of the group's longest-standing member Carmit Bachar. It was first recorded for Nicole Scherzinger's planned solo project, Her Name Is Nicole, but after its cancellation and Scherzinger's return to the group, she felt that the song was better suited for the group. It was written by Theron Thomas, Timothy Thomas and Rodney \"Darkchild\" Jerkins, who also produced the song. It is an uptempo electropop song with elements of the 1966 song, \"He's Always There\" by British rock band The Yardbirds. \"When I Grow Up\" speaks about the desire to be famous, and was described as being \"autobiographical\" by Scherzinger. The single was received favorably by contemporary music critics, many of whom highlighted it as a stand-out. It peaked at number nine on the US Billboard Hot 100, becoming the group's highest charting single since \"Buttons\" (2006). The song has sold over two million digital copies in the United States, making the Pussycat Dolls the first female group in digital history to have three singles pass the two million mark in digital sales. The song reached the top-five in countries such as Australia, Canada, France, Ireland, New Zealand and the United Kingdom, and the top-ten in Austria, Denmark, Germany and Switzerland. The song's accompanying music video premiered on June 13, 2008. Directed by Joseph Khan, it portrays the Pussycat Dolls in a traffic jam on Hollywood Boulevard. It was complimented for its dance breakdown, and was nominated in five categories at the 2008 MTV Video Music Awards, the most of that ceremony, and went on to win Best Dance Video. The Pussycat Dolls performed the song on television shows including Jimmy Kimmel Live! and So You Think You Can Dance, as well several award shows including the 2008 American Music Awards, and throughout their Doll Domination Tour (2009)."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"Young Guns (Go for It)\" (mostly written with an exclamation mark as \"Young Guns (Go for It!)\") was a song by British pop duo Wham! which was released in 1982 on Innervision Records. It was written by George Michael, one half of the duo. The song was Wham!'s first hit, although it came with some help from the BBC music programme Top of the Pops, which invited Wham! on to the show as a last-minute replacement for another act which had pulled out. It helped that the producer of Top of the Pops had seen them previously on another programme: Saturday Superstore. Wham! were just outside the Top 40 threshold of the UK Singles Chart at the time, which meant they had not climbed high enough in normal circumstances to get on the show, but they were recruited nonetheless as the highest-placed artists still climbing the charts from outside the 40. The song entered the chart initially at Number 73, went up to Number 48, then dropped to Number 52 and the week after that, it jumped to Number 42. Their appearance on Top of the Pops broke the record wide open and on the following Monday the distribution centre received some thirty thousand orders. This sent the record to Number 24 before eventually peaking at Number 3 in November 1982. George wrote the song about a teenage lad's worry that his best friend was getting too committed to a girl when he should have been enjoying his youth and the single life. It featured a middle eight aside in which the girl conversely tried to get her boyfriend to ditch the best friend, prompting a vocal battle, akin to a tug of war, between the girlfriend and the best friend which prompted the \"go for it!\" aspect of the song, as featured in the title. On Top of the Pops, George mimed the vocals to his Wham! partner Andrew Ridgeley, who \"acted\" the part of the teenage bridegroom-in-waiting. They were flanked by backing singers Dee C. Lee and Shirlie Holliman."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"Cognoscenti vs. Intelligentsia\" (also known as \"C vs. I\", meaning \"the experts versus the intellectual elite\") is a song by the Cuban Boys. The song consists almost in its entirety of a sampled loop from \"Whistle Stop\" by Roger Miller which was featured in the Disney movie Robin Hood. The sample was first featured on the Internet as part of \"The Hampster Dance\" song on the website of the same name. The song's closing lines are of an announcer of a children's radio show: This last line, usually omitted on radio play, is itself a sample from Kermit Schafer's 1950s \"recreation\" of a supposed on-air blooper by 1920s children's radio presenter, \"Uncle Don\". In fact, this faux pas is an urban legend. The sample caused many complaints to the band's label EMI, enough for a Parental Advisory sticker to be included on the single by the end of the single's first week of release, presumably by those assuming the song to be aimed at children. Additionally, the sample was left unedited on Now 45 and when the song was played by Jo Whiley on BBC Radio 1 in November, the broadcast of the song which eventually greenlit the single's release by EMI, the sample was again unedited, causing much controversy. Another notable quote within the song is taken from the 1950s dramatization of Jules Verne's Journey to the Center of the Earth: \"Don't be too happy. After a couple of months of this you'll be smacking your lips at the thought of salt beef.\" The song was first aired on John Peel's BBC Radio 1 show on April 7, 1999 and quickly became one of the most requested songs on his show, surpassing even \"God Save the Queen\" by the Sex Pistols. After being included on a free sampler CD on the industry magazine The Tip Sheet, the song caught the attention of numerous large record labels including EMI, Parlophone and RCA, thanks mostly to the efforts of Jonathan King. The band eventually signed for EMI. They were given \u00A325,000 to record a video for the song which ended up featuring a giant fibreglass melon covered in trifle and a live-action hamster singing along. Originally scheduled for release as a single in November 1999, the release date was threatened to be pushed back to some time in January 2000 until the song was played on Jo Whiley's afternoon radio show. It received much the same attention as when it had been played on Peel's show. The decision was made to move the release to December 13 to put it in line for the Christmas number 1 slot. It managed to get to number 4, being beaten by Westlife's \"I Have a Dream\". The song did however top John Peel's Festive Fifty for that year. Naturally, the song grew extreme reactions. Music journalist Charles Shaar Murray said the song was \"eloquent in it\u2019s sheer vacuity\" during a highbrow debate on Channel 4 News, and Cliff Richard, whose song \"The Millennium Prayer\", which had been number 1 in the three weeks before the chart debut of \"Cognoscenti vs. Intelligentsia\" and was released to very negative reviews, said the song was \"awful\" during an appearance on Newsround. The band's performance on Top of the Pops of the song, reportedly unaired, saw the band dressed in lab coats and covered in cobwebs. Because of the relative obscurity of the Cuban Boys both before and after the single, they are generally considered to be a one-hit wonder. The people behind the Cuban Boys went on to score further one-hit wonder successes with a remake of \"Rhinestone Cowboy\" with Glen Campbell, a novelty kids band called the Barndance Boys, and the US club hit \"I Am Gothic\" under the name Spray."@en ;

In addition to being one of the songs that helped break Aerosmith into the mainstream in the 1970s, it also helped revitalize their career in the 1980s when it was covered by rappers Run\u2013D.M.C. on their 1986 album Raising Hell. This cover was a touchstone for the new musical subgenre of rap rock, or the melding of rock and hip hop. It became an international hit and won both groups a Soul Train Music Award for Best Rap \u2013 Single in 1987."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"What's Love Got to Do with It\" is a song recorded by the American singer Tina Turner, released in 1984. It was taken from her fifth solo album, Private Dancer and became Turner's most successful single. Although Turner had already scored a UK Top 10 and U.S. Top 30 hit some months earlier with her rendition of \"Let's Stay Together\", \"What's Love Got To Do With It\" gave Turner her first and only U.S. number one. The song ranked #309 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of \"The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time\". It also ranked #38 on Songs of the Century. It was the 17th best-selling single of 1984 in the United Kingdom. In 1993, the song's title was used as the title for the biographical film about Turner's life. It was featured in the Miami Vice episode \"Calderone's Return (Part II)\", as Sonny Crockett and Ricardo Tubbs leave St. Andrews Island by boat and end credits. In 2012, \"What's Love Got to Do with It\" was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame giving Turner her 3rd Grammy Hall of Fame Award and her 11th Grammy Award."@en ;

The song was originally featured in Jackson's 1986 3D film Captain EO. It is the sixth song on the album. The song also appeared as a dance attack and level song for the later revisions of Michael Jackson's Moonwalker video game (originally the first revision used excerpts of Thriller). As with earlier songs in his career such as \"Can You Feel It\" and \"We Are the World\", the lyrics emphasize global unity, love and outreach. The song was also featured in the trailer for Jackson's 1988 film Moonwalker. In July 2009, a short part of the song has been used by singer Madonna as a tribute during the second leg of her Sticky & Sweet Tour. A Jackson impersonator performed his signature moves, while dancing to a medley of Jackson's songs. According to Quincy Jones in an interview that was featured in the 2001 special edition of Bad, Jackson wanted to include \"Streetwalker\" instead of \"Another Part of Me\". However, after manager Frank DiLeo was caught dancing along to the song, it was decided that \"Another Part of Me\" would be featured on the album. \"Streetwalker\" was later released on the 2001 special edition and the second disc of 25th anniversary re-issue."@en ;

The band's new sound bridged the gap between the public's taste for post-grunge rock anthems, and the slinky mechanical seduction of electronica. After an argument with Liam Gallagher of Oasis, Hutchence added some additional vocals to the chorus, which the rest of the band were unaware of until months after the album's release. When listening for it, the chorus can either be heard as \"I am elegantly wasted\" or \"I am better than Oasis\". This was further to an altercation between Michael Hutchence and the Gallagher brothers at the 1996 BRIT awards. At the awards Noel collected an award from Hutchence by saying \"Has-beens should not be presenting awards to gonna-be's.\" It was also reported that Liam Gallagher and Michael Hutchence had a scuffle backstage with Hutchence throwing a fire extinguisher at Liam following some disparaging remarks he made about his then lover Paula Yates.

She imagines her body in their place, which makes her feel better about returning to her safe home and the arms of her lover. \"Hyperballad\" was heavily lauded from contemporary music critics, who stated that it was the best song of Bj\u00F6rk's career. The song's lyrical content, vocal performance and experimentation in its production and composition were also highly praised. The song was moderately successful in the countries it charted in, including Finland, Australia, United States, Sweden and the United Kingdom (where it was the last of three top-10 hits, after \"Army of Me\" and \"It's Oh So Quiet\"). A music video was shot for the single, featuring a digitalized Bj\u00F6rk running through a field. Bj\u00F6rk performed the song at the 1997 Tibetan Freedom Concert in New York, which was recorded by Sylvia Massy for Capitol Records. This live version was subsequently included on the second disc of the Tibetan Freedom Concert album released later that year."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"Never Too Far/Hero Medley\" is a medley recorded by American singer-songwriter Mariah Carey, first released as a charity single on December 11, 2001 through Virgin Records America and serving as the lead single for Carey's second compilation album, Greatest Hits (2001). The medley combines the first verse of \"Never Too Far\", co-written and co-produced by Carey and Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis, with a re-recorded version of the first verse and bridge of \"Hero\", written and produced by Carey and Walter Afanasieff. As the latter did not receive co-production credits due to the change in instrumentation, Randy Jackson was named as producer alongside Carey instead. The single was meant to express a message of unity and love in the aftermath of the September 11 attacks. Though Carey did not promote Glitter (2001), due to her hospitalization, she embarked on a short promotional tour for the single, and attended several charitable events. Carey performed the medley live at the 2001 Radio Music Awards, British music program Top of the Pops, the United We Stand: What More Can I Give concert benefit, and her own special titled, At Home For The Holidays With Mariah Carey. Following the singles release, the song managed to attain a peak position of number eighty-one on the Billboard Hot 100, in light of all of Carey's live appearances. Though promoted throughout Europe, the single was never given an official release outside the United States, therefore failing to chart in any other significant global music market."@en ;

The song is notable both for being one of John's most critically and commercially successful singles, becoming a #7 hit record in the singer's native United Kingdom, and for being one of the most aggressively bombastic, hard rock inspired tracks ever recorded by the artist. Featuring energetic, rapid-fire piano playing reminiscent of Jerry Lee Lewis, the track was composed along with John's long-time song-writing partner Bernie Taupin and has been a staple of the artist's live performances for many years, being played over 1,300 times live (making it one of John's top ten most performed tracks in his entire discography) as of December 2015."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"5 Colours in Her Hair\" is the debut single by English pop rock band McFly. It was also the band's first UK number one. It stayed at the top for two weeks. The song was written by two of the band members, Tom Fletcher and Danny Jones, and Busted member James Bourne. The track is especially well known for its \"Doo, Doo, Doo, Doo, Doo, Doo!\" lyrics, played at the beginning and at the ending of the song. The CD also features a duet with Busted singing a cover of The Kinks song \"Lola\". Overall, it spent twelve weeks in the UK Singles Chart. It also reached number seven in Ireland. The song was inspired by Suzanne Lee, a character played by actress Emily Corrie in the TV series As If, who wore coloured dreadlocks. The music itself is indebted to 1960s surf and beat music. The song was also nominated for The Record of the Year in 2004, but finished in second place just one point behind the winner, \"Thunderbirds / 3AM\" by Busted."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"Dress You Up\" is a song by American singer Madonna from her second studio album Like a Virgin (1984). It was released on July 24, 1985 as the album's final single, by Sire Records. The song was the last track to be added to the album as it was submitted late by songwriters Andrea LaRusso and Peggy Stanziale. Madonna pushed for the song's inclusion on Like a Virgin as she particularly liked its lyrics. Musically, the song is a drum beat driven dance track featuring instrumentation from guitars and vocals from a choir and a guitar solo played by Nile Rodgers, who also produced the song. The lyrics are an extended metaphor for fashion and sex, comparing dressing up with passion. A live performance from Madonna's first tour was used as the music video. Critics reacted positively to the dance-pop nature of the track. \"Dress You Up\" became Madonna's sixth consecutive top-five single in the United States. It also reached the top-ten in Australia, Belgium, Canada, Ireland, New Zealand and the United Kingdom. The song was performed on four of Madonna's concert tours, most recently on the Rebel Heart Tour (2015\u201316). \"Dress You Up\" was added to the \"Filthy Fifteen\" list of the Parents Music Resource Center, due to the sexual nature of its lyrics. The song has been covered in different forms by a number of artists."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"November Spawned a Monster\" is a song by Morrissey. It was released as a single in 1990. It was written by Morrissey and Clive Langer. It also features one of Morrissey's former colleagues from The Smiths, Andy Rourke. In reaching number 12 in the British chart it was a marked improvement over Morrissey's previous single, \"Ouija Board, Ouija Board\", but still failed to chart as high as the singer's first four releases. The track is one of Morrissey's personal favourites, and has been played live many times by the singer. It along with its b-side \"He Knows I'd Love to See Him\" appears on the compilation album Bona Drag. The song tackles the plight of the disabled, an unusual subject matter for a pop single. As ever with Morrissey the tone and sentiments are riddled with ambiguity. His use of words such as 'monster' and 'twisted' creates a strange mix of revulsion, sympathy and black comedy, all used to enlighten, and disturb, the audience. By forcing the ambivalent persona of tormentor and saviour, Morrissey forces the listener to confront their own prejudices head on.\" The song is quoting Les Chants de Maldoror (Chant 2, verse 7), in which a hermaphrodite perceives himself as a monster and dreams of love. In November 2014 Alex Broun's play November Spawned a Monster, inspired by Morrissey's song, premiered at The Old Fitzroy, in Sydney, Australia, directed by Robert Chuter (director) and starring James Wright."@en ;

The track features vocals from Missy Elliott. The single was released on September 29, 2003 in Europe, but was not released in the United Kingdom until March 8, 2004. The track itself refers to people downloading and burning music instead of buying it, which at the time, was an epidemic affecting rappers and their album sales. All of the tracks' verses are resung verses from classic rap songs, however some of the lyrics are changed to show the artist's originality. Timbaland's verse is a rewriter of \"I Know You Got Soul\" by Eric B. & Rakim, Missy's verse is a rewrite of \"Paper Thin\" by MC Lyte, and Magoo's verse is a rewrite of \"I Got It Made\" by Special Ed. The music video for the track shows Timbaland, Missy and Magoo in various scenes, but mostly near a brick wall with an Emcee, which they borrowed their verse's from, and a spraypainted image of themselves. The video also features a rap interlude by rapper Sebastian. The video also features dancer, Mari Koda, who would later star in the dance movie Step Up 3D.[citation needed]"@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"I Can't Help Myself (Sugar Pie Honey Bunch)\" is a 1965 hit song recorded by the Four Tops for the Motown label. Written and produced by Motown's main production team Holland\u2013Dozier\u2013Holland, the song is one of the most well-known Motown tunes of the 1960s. The song reached number one on the R&B charts and was also the number-one song on the Billboard Hot 100 for two non-consecutive weeks, from June 12 to June 19 and from June 26 to July 3 in 1965. It replaced \"Back in My Arms Again\" by labelmates The Supremes, was first replaced by \"Mr. Tambourine Man\" by The Byrds, then regained the top spot before being replaced by \"(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction\" by The Rolling Stones. Billboard ranked the record as the No. 2 song of 1965. It was also the Four Tops first Top 40 single in the UK, reaching #23. The song finds lead singer Levi Stubbs, assisted by the other three Tops and The Andantes, pleadingly professing his love to a woman: \"Sugar pie, honey bunch/I'm weaker than a man should be!/Can't help myself/I'm a fool in love, you see.\" Like most of his lead parts, Stubbs' vocals are recorded in a tone that straddles the line between singing and shouting, similar to the tone of a black Baptist preacher. The melodic and chordal progressions are very similar to the Supremes' \"Where Did Our Love Go\". Allmusic critic Ed Hogan claims that the song uses the same chords as The Supremes' 1964 hit \"Where Did Our Love Go,\" also written by Holland-Dozier-Holland. Rolling Stone magazine ranked the song #415 on their list of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time. It has been covered extensively since 1965, including versions done for several television commercials."@en ;

Released following a highly publicized campaign by Yayo's record label, G-Unit Records, to release Yayo from a prison sentence being served prior to the song's release, \"So Seductive\" is an uptempo \"club banger\" containing elements of string instruments and a repetitive bassline in its instrumentation. The song received little promotion from Yayo at the time of its release, as he was still under house arrest following the end of his prison sentence, although he has since performed the song during various live performances. \"So Seductive\" became Yayo's most commercially successful song, reaching number 48 on the US Billboard Hot 100; it also remains Yayo's only song to chart outside the United States, peaking in the top 30 of the Irish and United Kingdom singles charts. The song received generally positive reviews from music critics, who complimented its energy and 50 Cent's performance in the chorus, although some wrote negatively towards Yayo's rapping and also noted a lack of originality in the song's production. \"So Seductive\" was nominated for best \"Club Banger\" at the 2005 Vibe Awards, but lost to \"1 Thing\" by Amerie."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"Jack Names the Planets\" is a song by Ash. It was their first official single release in February 1994. The single was originally released on vinyl only and is entirely different from the album version that appears on their EP, Trailer. The single was re-released in a limited edition 2002 on 2 December in CD format with and the Raptor 12\" version of \"Season\" as an extra B-side, as part of the promotion for the Intergalactic Sonic 7\u2033s greatest hits collection. The song first appeared on the Shed demo tape, recorded in 1992 and again on the Garage Girl and Pipe Smokin' Brick demo-tapes. Ash were first signed when a copy of Garage Girl was given to Stephen 'Tav' Tavner, who signed them on the basis of \"Jack Names the Planets\". Only 2,000 copies of the single were released, and the single was recorded on a \u00A3300 budget. However, the band was unhappy with the version released on the 1994 single, and re-recorded it for their first album. The title of the track is taken from a chapter of the Stephen King and Peter Straub novel, The Talisman. This book is further referenced in some of the lyrics. The single's B-side, \"Don't Know\", first appeared on the Garage Girl demo tape. In 1995, the song appeared on the soundtrack for the film Angus. Clips from the movie were interspersed with footage of Ash performing as figures in moving posters for the video of \"Jack Names the Planets\", which was also released in 1995. Phil Harder directed the video. The first 50,000 pressings of Ash's first full-length album, 1977, began with \"Jack Names the Planets\" and \"Don't Know\" as hidden tracks found by rewinding the CD, before the usual opener \"Lose Control\". \"Jack Names the Planets\" also appeared on Ash's first greatest hits collection Intergalactic Sonic 7\u2033s, and is considered a fan and band favourite. It is rare not to be included in the band's live setlist. During the spoken section at the beginning of the song, two Dutchmen, Oscar \"Wilde\" Vermeer and Patrick \"The Brewer\" Schrama (who met Tim Wheeler during a holiday in France), suggest that the song should have been called \"Jack Names The Planet Nieuw-Vennep\", given that, in their opinion, \"Nieuw-Vennep\" is a good name for a planet. Nieuw-Vennep is a town of thirty thousand inhabitants in the west of Holland, midway between The Hague and Amsterdam."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"Lookin' Out My Back Door\" is a song recorded by the American band Creedence Clearwater Revival, also known as CCR. The song was written by the band's lead singer, guitarist, and songwriter, John Fogerty. The song is included on their 1970 album Cosmo's Factory, the group's fifth album, which was also their fifth and final No. 2 Billboard hit. It was certified Gold and in the early 1990s was also certified Platinum. In 2003 Cosmo's Factory was ranked 265 on Rolling Stone's list of 500 greatest albums of all time. However, the album signaled the decline and subsequent end for the band. \"Lookin' Out My Back Door\" was a direct tribute to the Bakersfield Sound, a form of music that influenced John Fogerty and the Creedence sound. Buck Owens, one of the architects of the Bakersfield Sound, is even mentioned in the song's lyrics."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"All the Things She Said\" is a song by Russian group t.A.T.u. from their fourth studio album 200 km/h in the Wrong Lane (2002). The song was released as the album's lead single on 19 August 2002. It was written by Sergio Galoyan, Trevor Horn, Martin Kierszenbaum, Elena Kiper and Valeriy Polienko, while production was by Horn. \"All The Things She Said\" is the English-language version of their 1999 single \"Ya Soshla S Uma\". \"All The Things She Said\" received mixed reviews from music critics, while some commended the production and lyrical content, others called it a gimmick and suggestive. The song reached number one in several countries around the world, including Australia, Austria, France, New Zealand, Switzerland and the UK. \"All The Things She Said\" reached number twenty on the US Billboard Hot 100, the first Russian act to accomplish this. Ivan Shapovalov commissioned the accompanying music video for the single, which shows the group behind a fence in school uniforms, trying to escape. The music video caused considerable controversy in several nations because it depicted themes of lesbianism. Several organisations protested the video to be banned, while some music stations removed the scene with the girls kissing. The song had been performed many times, including on many MTV live shows, along with a megamix with \"Not Gonna Get Us\" at the MTV Movie Awards."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"Diamonds and Pearls\" is the title track to Prince and The New Power Generation's 1991 hit album. The song is an upbeat ballad, given a rock edge with guitar and heavy drumming. The song also features the vocals of NPG member Rosie Gaines. The ballad is an expression of love and not lust, as is the theme on some of the other singles from the album. The song was a top 10 hit, reaching #3 in the U.S. and the top spot on the R&B charts. The infamous pearls in the music video come from Connie Parente, a Los Angeles jewelry collector and designer. The B-side is a mix of excerpts of other Diamonds and Pearls tracks, which serves to promote the album. There was no extended version of the song released. The UK B-side included some of the mixes on the \"Cream\" maxi single. The repeated lyric \"If I gave you diamonds and pearls, would you be a happy boy or a girl?\" echoes the lyrics \"I'll buy you diamonds and pearls only if you're good girl\" from Prince's 1982 song, \"International Lover\". Rapper Lil Wayne sampled the song on his mixtape Da Drought, with the term \"Diamonds & Girls\". Polish jazz pianist Marcin Wasilewski and his trio included an instrumental version of the song on their 2008 ECM album January."@en ;

dbr:Evil_on_Your_Mind	rdf:type	dbo:MusicalWork ;
	dbo:abstract	"\"Evil on Your Mind\" is the name of a popular Country music song, originally made famous by Grand Ole Opry star Jan Howard in 1966. In the mid-'60s, Jan Howard was not acquiring any significant hits. Only one of her songs hit the Top 20: in 1960, \"The One You Slip Around With\" hit No. 13. In 1966, Howard wrote and released her first single of the year, \"Evil on Your Mind\". The song was written by her husband at the time, songwriter Harlan Howard. The song hit the Top 5 on the Billboard Country music charts, peaking at No. 5 there. An album of the same name was released that year, featuring Howard's big hit. A successful follow-up single entitled \"Bad Seed\" hit the Top 10 that year. The song set the stage for a number of Top 20 and Top 10 hits that Howard would have as a solo and duet artist between 1966 and 1971. The song talks about a husband trying to convince his wife to visit her sister out west, but the narrator (the wife) notices that something is going on, which her husband is trying to hide. She believes he is thinking of having an affair, which she calls \"evil on your mind\". The song has been featured in the book Heartaches By the Number: The 500 Greatest Country Singles. A rock music group named The Stumbleweeds recorded Howard's \"Evil on Your Mind\". An answer song version was recorded by Burl Ives as \"Evil Off My Mind\" and became a modest country hit later that year, peaking at #47 in Billboard. The Ives record was one of the handful of answer songs by a male vocalist to a female star's hit; generally it was the other way around. Ella Fitzgerald recorded this song on her 1968 Capitol recording \"Misty Blue\", where it is attributed to Harlan Howard of Wilderness Music."@en ;

A promotional version of the single was released on 14 August 2006, featuring the full version and a shorter version called \"edited version\" in the US promo CD and \"rock club mix\" in the UK promo CD (both versions are identical). The single was not allowed to have a place in the UK charts because the overall music time on the CD exceeded the time limit for it to be classed as a single. On 17 July 2006, a music video for the song was uploaded on the band's official website. It had initially been released only for paying fan club members, but it was leaked within minutes and viewed by many fans who posted the link on various Iron Maiden discussion forums. The video displays them performing in the studio along with classic photos and clips of the band over their lengthy career. The guitar solo in \"The Reincarnation of Benjamin Breeg\" is played by Dave Murray."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"Touch Me I'm Sick\" is a song by the American alternative rock band Mudhoney. It was recorded in March 1988 at Seattle's Reciprocal Recording studio with producer Jack Endino. \"Touch Me I'm Sick\" was released as Mudhoney's debut single by independent record label Sub Pop on August 1, 1988. The song's lyrics, which feature dark humor, are a sarcastic take on issues such as disease and violent sex. When it was first released, \"Touch Me I'm Sick\" was a hit on the indie circuit, and is still the band's most recognizable song. The heavily distorted and fuzzy guitars, snarling vocals, blunt bass line and energetic drumming contributed to a dirty sound that influenced many local musicians, and helped develop the nascent Seattle grunge scene. According to Allmusic, \"the song's raw, primal energy made it an instant anthem which still stands as one of [grunge's] all-time classics\"."@en ;

dbr:Walking_in_Memphis	rdf:type	dbo:MusicalWork ;
	dbo:abstract	"\"Walking in Memphis\" is a song composed and originally recorded by the Jewish-American singer-songwriter Marc Cohn, for whom it remains his signature song. Cohn said the song is \"100 percent autobiographical\". He described it as a song about \"a Jewish gospel-music-lover\", and as \"a pretty literal transcription of a visit I made ... in 1986. I went to Graceland, I heard Al Green preach the gospel, I saw W. C. Handy's statue. But the song is about more than just a place, it's about a kind of spiritual awakening, one of those trips where you're different when you leave.\"[page needed][clarification needed : please provide URL] It reflects on Cohn's experience as a Jew who feels the Gospel spirit of Memphis. The last verse refers to Cohn's inspirational encounter with singer Muriel Wilkins, with whom he performed \"Amazing Grace\". This all culminates in the iconic lyric, \"\u2009'Tell me are you a Christian, child?' and I said, 'Ma'am, I am tonight!'\u2009\" Cohn finds it funny that many listeners infer from the lyric that he is a Christian or born again. \"But to me,\" Cohn said, \"that line could have only been written by a Jew. It's such a Jewish line, and I love that.\" Cohn reached number 13 in 1991 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. It was the only Top 40 hit for Cohn. \"Walking in Memphis\" has since been remade several times, notably in 1995 by Cher (number 11 UK) and in 2003 by Lonestar (number 8 C&W/ number 61 Hot 100)."@en ;

That same year, French singer Nicoletta sold two million copies of the song,[citation needed] as \"Je ne pense que t'aimer\", the version which subsequently inspired Dusty Springfield's version.[citation needed] That same year Quebec singer Michel Pagliaro (lead singer of the band Les Chanceliers) released a cover of this song in French (\"A Paris la Nuit\").

It was the third single from their 1999 studio album, Dysfunction, and served as a breakthrough hit. \"Mudshovel\" reached number 14 on the Modern Rock Charts and number 10 on the Mainstream Rock charts. It originally appeared in a heavier form as 'Mudshuvel' on their debut album Tormented. The new version was given a radio-friendly makeover with beefed up production while almost eliminating the screams, palm muted guitar and double bass drums in the chorus. During Staind concerts, \"Mudshovel\" is usually played as an encore. It has become one of the most definitive songs for Staind's distinctive heavy side, and was the gateway to their further success. A music video was filmed for the single. It mostly consists of the band playing in an enclosed arena on an elevated glass stage above a mosh pit and frontman Aaron Lewis clutching a loose gate. Interspersed with this is a storyline involving a man being cheated on by his wife/girlfriend, only for her to be cheated on as well in the ending. Musically, \"Mudshovel\" relies on a distinctive three-note bass line that shifts into a rumbling low. It opens the song and is preceded by tense vocals and a heavy ensemble of flanging guitar and drums which make up the verses. The chorus features chunky guitar riffs and a repeated murmuring of the song title. The song was featured in Midway Entertainment's Hockey game \"NHL Hitz 20-02\". The single stayed in the top ten Mainstream Rock Charts for only 1 week. The stage that the band is performing on is the same stage that Limp Bizkit used their music video of \"My Generation\"."@en ;

Despite the success of \"Sha-La-La-La-Lee\" the band never really liked the song and felt it did not represent their sound, which was more R&B and soul oriented. The song was seen by some as the beginning of the end for the Small Faces; it was following the release of this song that the group became often viewed in the music press as just another teenybopper band, who should not be taken as seriously as some of their contemporaries, such as The Who and Rolling Stones. Whereas previously their fans tended to be music-mad mods, their following now included young teenage girls who were more interested in the good looks of the young male musicians than in their music. At most of their concerts, like many of their contemporaries, the band could not even be heard above the girl fans' loud and constant screaming. This situation would ultimately end in Marriott becoming so disenchanted that he would finally leave The Small Faces in a bid to be seen as a serious musician and form his next group, the heavier rock and blues-sounding Humble Pie. Small Faces performed \"Sha-La-La-La-Lee\" live for the Dick Clark show in the United States, telerecorded from the UK."@en ;

The song discusses school bullying, despite this not being Harris and Klebold's motivation for the shooting: \"Why do I have to be one that the cool kids just to walk by, without being tripped, thrown down on the ground and kicked? Insulting me for no reason. I was treated like shit! The teachers let it happen. I've even seen some of them teachers laughing. thats why I had a smile on my face when I started blasting.I was the nicest person in the world.

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/She\u0027s_Not_Just_a_Pretty_Face>	rdf:type	dbo:MusicalWork ;
	dbo:abstract	"\"She's Not Just a Pretty Face\" is a song co-written and recorded by Canadian country music singer Shania Twain. It was the fourth country single from her album Up!. The song was written by Robert John \"Mutt\" Lange and Twain. Twain had announced that \"Nah!\" would be the next single after \"Forever and for Always\", but \"She's Not Just a Pretty Face\" was released instead. It became Twain's 15th top ten single on Billboard Country. The song was originally to be released to the UK as a pop single, but that plan was cancelled. It was however released to Eastern Europe as the fourth single, where it did reasonably well in some countries. \"She's Not Just a Pretty Face\" debuted in North America on October 6, 2003. Despite reaching the top ten, \"She's Not Just a Pretty Face\" was not included in Twain's 2004 Greatest Hits CD. The song was also nominated for Best Female Country Vocal Performance at the 2005 Grammy Awards. The song was also performed on some highly rated TV shows, The Oprah Winfrey Show, the 2003 Country Music Awards, and the 2003 Billboard Music Awards, all helping it land in the top ten."@en ;
