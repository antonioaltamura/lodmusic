In 1959, McGlown started dating future Temptations member Paul Williams, who was then singing with the Primes. Around the same time, the Primes' booking agent and manager Milton Jenkins was scouting the Detroit neighborhoods looking for girls to become part of the Primes' sister act. After he discovered Florence Ballard, Ballard set about recruiting other girls she knew, quickly asking Mary Wilson, who asked Diana Ross to join. Due to her connection with Williams, McGlown became the last to join the Primettes. Along with their guitarist, Marv Tarplin, the girls performed for Berry Gordy who, although impressed, told them they were too young for the business and encouraged them to finish school. On Lupine Records, McGlown sang backing vocals for Mary Wilson on \"Pretty Baby\" and backing vocals for Diana Ross on \"Tears of Sorrow\". These became the only known recordings of McGlown, although her voice does not stand out by itself in either song. While all four members sang lead on stage, it is only the other three members who ever had leads on studio recordings. McGlown eventually became Mrs. Betty Travis and left the Primettes in 1960 to concentrate on her new marriage. She was replaced by Barbara Martin the same year. Betty McGlown-Travis died of diabetes in January 2008 at Beaumont Hospital in Royal Oak, Michigan at the age of 66."@en ;

Haley is the youngest child of rock and roll pioneer Bill Haley from his marriage to his last wife Martha; she grew up in Harlingen and she was only five years old when her father died in 1981. At 18 years old she left home and set out to find her musical identity which landed her in Houston, Tx. She is classically trained on piano and an accomplished self-taught guitarist and songwriter. During the mid-1990s she left Houston and moved to Los Angeles.She managed to catch the eye of producer Michael Sembello, and worked closely with him writing, recording and arranging tracks which appeared in television and movies. Gina also worked closely with songwriter Richard Rudolph and published songs through Music Sales Group. Her first self-titled album was released in Japan in 1999 Heat Wave.During these years in Los Angeles she sang with the world music group called The Bridge whose members included Edu Falcao, Daniel Jobim, Paulinho Da Costa, Vincent Colaiuta and Michael Sembello. Gina later formed her own group, the Gina Haley Band and continues to work in the musical field in her home state of Texas. On July 6, 2005, she performed with her father's old band, The Comets at the Viper Room in West Hollywood as part of 50th anniversary celebrations of her father's famous song \"Rock Around the Clock\" reaching the No. 1 position on American sales charts, as well as what would have been Bill Haley's 80th birthday. In June 2008, the Gina Haley Band performed at the Bill Haley induction to the South Texas Music Walk of Fame in Corpus Christi, TX. Other inductees included Chelo Silva, Pat Grogan, Joe Gallardo, Max Stalling, and The Reverend Horton Heat.Meeting Jim Heath a.k.a. Reverend Horton Heat, was an important event in Gina's life. Jim had not intended to perform at the induction ceremony as his band had not traveled with him but decided to dedicate a Bill Haley song to Gina, a song that inspired him to become a musician. That song was \"Rock the Joint\". After years of contemplating making a rockabilly album Gina had finally decided that it was time to carry on her father's legacy. A year later she sang \"Rock the Joint\" with Reverend Horton Heat at a concert in Dallas, TX. She is now preparing a rockabilly show that is due to start next March 2011 in the UK with an album to follow.She continues to perform in Texas with the Gina Haley Band, aka GHB in her original alternative country sound."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Jan Bradley (born Addie Bradley, July 6, 1943 in Byhalia, Mississippi) is an American soul singer. Bradley grew up in Robbins, Illinois. She was noticed by manager Don Talty (who also managed Phil Upchurch) at a high school talent show singing with The Passions. After graduating, she auditioned for Curtis Mayfield, and soon recorded the Mayfield-penned \"We Girls\", which became a hit regionally in the Midwest (on Talty's Formal Records label). Several singles followed, and another Mayfield song originally issued on Formal, \"Mama Didn't Lie\" (b/w \"Lovers Like Me\"), was released nationally in the U.S. by Chess Records in 1963 and hit #8 R&B and #14 on the Billboard Hot 100. Following the single's success, Mayfield and Chess got into a legal battle over the publishing rights to Mayfield's songs, and as a result Bradley was no longer able to work with him. She started writing her own songs and released several further singles on Chess. \"I'm Over You\" hit #24 R&B in 1965; other Chess releases included \"Just a Summer Memory\" b/w \"He'll Wait on Me\", \"It's Just Your Way\", and \"These Tears\" b/w \"Baby What Can I Do\". Bradley continued working with Talty after her arrangement with Chess ended, releasing singles for the smaller Adanti, Hootenanny, Doylen, Spectra Sound, and Night Owl labels. Bradley stopped singing professionally in the early 1970s; she raised a family and became a social worker. She resides in the south suburbs of Chicago and has two children named Timothy and Jamila. She is also the grandmother of three and continues to sing in her church choir. Her records remained popular among devotees of Northern soul. Her catalog of music, both writing and singing, includes soul, pop and even rock and roll."@en ;

Kid606's music is similar to the work of his friend and colleague Lesser, as well as hardcore and IDM acts such as Atari Teenage Riot, Autechre, Mr. Oizo, and Matmos. He is primarily inspired not by his electronic contemporaries, but by his love of the industrial music, death metal, and industrial metal of the 1980s and 1990s, particularly bands like Godflesh and Napalm Death. His music is known for its high tempo breakbeats and liberal use of noise and sampling, as well as its punk aesthetic, uninhibited genre-mixing, and irreverent sense of humor. However, he is equally adept at creating more serious tracks that often reside in the realm of ambient and glitch (\"Parenthood\" from Kill Sound Before Sound Kills You and the entirety of P.S. I Love You being good examples). Notable releases by Kid606 include Don't Sweat the Technics (VC140: 1998), Down with the Scene (IPC-7:2000), P.S. I Love You (MP93: 2000), and Kill Sound Before Sound Kills You (IPC-46:2003). He collaborated or participated in the groups Flossin, Spacewurm, Ariel and Disc.

Tubby's innovative studio work, which saw him elevate the role of the mixing engineer to a creative fame previously only reserved for composers and musicians, would prove to be influential across many genres of popular music. He is often cited as the inventor of the concept of the remix, and so may be seen as a direct antecedent of much dance and electronic music production. Singer Mikey Dread stated, \"King Tubby truly understood sound in a scientific sense. He knew how the circuits worked and what the electrons did. That's why he could do what he did\"."@en .

His stage name was created by mixing the names of Olivia Newton-John, singer; and Ted Bundy, serial killer. In 1993 Brian's new band Collapsing Lungs (also known as L.U.N.G.S.) was signed to Atlantic Records. In 1996 Brian along with notable DJ Grynch created a new band, Nation of Fear. They released the song \"Immortal\" on a compilation CD for the (now defunct) rock station 94.9 WZTA. Later that year Nation of Fear would release their well-received self-titled album on DiMar Records. They would go on tour with Genitorturers and were even joined on tour by Lords of Acid. Nation of Fear (like their tour-mates) were known for stage antics including S&M, powertools, and pyrotechnics. In 1998 the band's second release Everything Beautiful Rusts, while receiving much more attention, failed to keep the band together and by 2000 they had broken up.

A record deal with Elektra Records produced Davis' first two albums; Blame It on Me, which was chosen as one of Time's five best albums of 1997, and 2001's Fortune Cookies, which featured production by The Neptunes and Ed Tuton. She released videos of the songs \"32 Flavors\" and \"Crazy.\" Davis achieved a radio hit with the single \"32 Flavors\" from her debut album. The song is a cover version of a track written and previously recorded by Ani DiFranco. Blame It on Me stayed on the Billboard Top 200 for seven weeks, peaking at #157 in February 1998 and reaching sales of over 240,000 in the United States. \"Murder\", also from Blame It on Me, was sampled on Jay-Z's Vol. 3... Life and Times of S. Carter. After a guest appearance on the 1999 soundtrack to The Mod Squad, Davis left Elektra and signed a single deal with SME Records. She released the single \"Carry On\" on this label, and the song was featured in a Super Bowl commercial for Sony Electronics. Tired of major record labels, Davis went independent in 2005 and formed her own, label Tigress Records.

Despite having a background in cello playing, Parker was heavily influenced by electronic pioneers such as Art Of Noise and Jean Michel Jarre. She formed the group Inky Blacknuss with producers Alex Knight and Ian Tregoning in 1993 for Andrew Weatherall's Sabrettes label, before signing to hip hop label Mo' Wax for her solo output, releasing her debut album Kiss My Arp (a reference to the vintage ARP synthesisers) in 1999. Electronic music producer David Morley was an important part of her musical output as co-writer and almost all her studio work took place in his studio in Germany (now Belgium). In 2002 Parker formed the Touchin' Bass imprint after splitting from Mo' Wax, citing problems with the label's management merger, and the subsequent hold up in releasing any of her further projects. With her long-time production partner David Morley, her output became rooted in a darker, less organic sound than her work with Mo' Wax. Her output referenced classic electro music from the 1980s, relying heavily on the use of drum machines such as the Roland TR-808, as well as electro's Miami Bass connection by collaborating with DJ Assault and DJ Godfather on her Freaky Bitches 12\".

	dbo:abstract	"Gregory Page (born April 14, 1963) is an American and Irish singer, songwriter, guitarist, cabaret artist, record producer and filmmaker. He was born in London, England on Easter Sunday in 1963. His Armenian and Irish parents met while they were on tour with their bands en route to the Middle East. His Irish Mother was the lead singer in the all-girl group \"The Beat-Chics\", who opened four concerts for The Beatles in Spain, August 1965. According to an interview with KGTV reporter Phil Konstantin, Gregory showed little interest in academic or business studies as a boy. However, he was always fascinated listening to 78 rpm records on his grandfather's phonograph. Upon arriving in the United States, he began a series of odd jobs, including as a cab driver and cook. He also began tirelessly writing and recording his own brand of music. It is easy to observe that the voice and music of Al Bowlly had a definite effect on Page's career. According to Page: \"The tightrope my music teeters upon is the struggle between tradition & progress, history & fantasy. I am the songbird & the worm.\" Besides working on his own music, Page has also worked with an array of artists such as Jason Mraz, John Doe, Jewel, Tom Brosseau, Steve Poltz, John C. Reilly and A.J. Croce. According to Jason Mraz: \"He\u2019s the real deal, a rare gift.\" In 1996, John Doe, formerly of the band X, provided lead guitar on and produced his independently released Fare thee Well album. His collaboration and friendship with Croce enticed him to join A.J.'s label Seedling Records and to release his CD, Love Made Me Drunk. In the 1990s, Gregory was a member of The Rugburns. He is currently living in Southern California and frequently tours Europe and Australia."@en ;

In 1997, M\u00E4enp\u00E4\u00E4 had to put his musical career on hold to take part in Finland's compulsory military service.

She is signed under Singapore record company Play Music which practises packaging and marketing their new artistes as cartoon caricatures on album covers and music videos. Jocie was depicted as a sweet innocent cartoon girl and became famous within weeks of her debut single release. The former Singapore Polytechnic student has been an instant success, with her two singles selling a combined 55,000 copies. Jocie is viewed as Warner Music Taiwan's priority artiste with an extensive multimillion-dollar marketing campaign planned for her regional debut and poised to follow in the footsteps of Warner's top Singaporean artiste, Stefanie Sun Yanzi. Her two music videos alone cost a staggering $250,000 to shoot, with top director Lai Wei-kang at the helm. Jocie was the first artiste to be granted legal copyrights to sing \u201C\"Mouse Loves Rice\" (\u8001\u9F20\u7231\u5927\u7C73)\u201D outside of China; the resulting hit single was the first to make it to the top of Singapore\u2019s RIAS sales chart in 2005. Her first album in 2006, \u4E0D\u6015\u4E0D\u6015 (No More Panic), out-competed its competitors and became number one on the RIAS sales chart only 10 days after its release. When released in Taiwan, it would sell more than 60,000 copies and attained Platinum status. For Singapore\u2019s 2006 May-Day concert, she was invited to perform alongside other big Singaporean stars such as Stefanie Sun in front of a crowd of 20,000. Jocie won many \u201Cbest newcomer\u201D type awards in 2006 such as the \u201CBest Female Newcomer\u201D award from both the 3rd Annual Hit King Awards event that was held in Guangzhou, China and the 6th Annual Global Chinese Music Award Ceremony; she would also win \u201CBest Newcomer\u201D during the Guangdong Radio Station\u2019s 9+2 Billboard Music Pioneer Awards Ceremony along with \u201C2006\u2019s Most Popular Song\u201D award for her \u201CBu Pa Bu Pa\u201D single.

	dbo:abstract	"Jono El Grande (born July 29, 1973) is the stage name of Jon Andreas H\u00E5tun. Jono El Grande is an autodidactic Norwegian composer, band leader, guitarist and conductor. He cites as his major sources of influence Captain Beefheart, '60s Frank Zappa, King Crimson, Igor Stravinsky and Art Rock. Jono El Grande claims that his extreme mixture of genres and timbres is a result of his musical vision: moving away from the traditional concept of 'music as a result of social processes'. Although Jono El Grande is enjoying modest growth on the European avant-garde scene, he is most well known in his own country for his eccentric and amusing performance art/dada-inspired live shows. In 2000 he formed The Jono El Grande Orchestra, renamed Jono El Grande & The Luxury Band in 2005. Jono El Grande has released six albums, Utopian Dances (Krusedull Prod. - 1999), Fevergreens (Rune Grammofon - 2003), Neo Dada (Rune Grammofon - 2009), \"Phantom Stimulance\" (Rune Grammofon - 2010), The Choko King (Rune Arkiv - 2011) and \"Melody Of A Muddled Mason\" (Rune Grammofon - 2015), in addition to contribute with compositions on other projects (both Rune Grammofons anniversary albums Money Will Ruin Everything 1 & 2\u201D and on Wire Tapper #21\u201D, the avant-garde music magazine The Wire\u2019s 21st edition of their CD series). Jono El Grande served as festival composer for Happy Days 2007, presented by Ny Musikk, the Norwegian section of ISCM \u2013 International Society For Contemporary Music. He also became a member of Norwegian Society Of Composers fall 2010. He played at the Zappanale #22 (August 2011) and world premiered a new orchestral piece for the Bergen located sinfonietta orchestra BIT20 Ensemble December 2011. In 2014 he wrote and released the classical piece \"Til Anbj\u00F8rg\" (For Anbjorg) for his late wife. In November 2014 he world premiered a new piece for Trondheim Sinfonietta at Rockheim in Trondheim.

Mari\u00E1ngel has been one of the most publicized Miss Venezuelas in the recent years, having been compared to Alicia Machado (Miss Universe 1996). Like Alicia, she won her national title against every prediction (in a contest where the results are almost never surprise) and was considered a \"rebel\" Miss Venezuela. Also, like Alicia, she turned in a spectacular performance at Miss Universe, in comparison to more \"conventional\" titleholders, and overcame a number of major odds both within and outside her control."@en .

	dbo:abstract	"Natalia Rodr\u00EDguez Gallego, usually known as Natalia (born 11 December 1982) is a Spanish singer. She was a contestant on the successful Spanish TV show Operaci\u00F3n Triunfo in 2001, where she finished 14th. In 2002, she released her album No soy un \u00E1ngel (I'm Not an Angel), produced by British dance producers Xenomania and the first single off the album, Vas a volverme loca, a cover version of Charlotte NIelsen's hit \"You Got Me Going Crazy\". In 2003, Natalia released Besa mi piel (Kiss My Skin). On this album, she included 4 of her own compositions (including the first single, also called 'Besa Mi Piel'). In 2004, she released Natalia, her third album. The first single was track penned by Lucie Silvas called Sombras (Shadows). The video (which featured Natalia in a haunted house being seduced by a ghost) was regarded as too inappropriate for young children and wasn't shown on Spanish TV until the late evening, which caused a flop in sales. Amid this, the second single, Que No Puede Ser (No, It Can't Be), became a lot more successful than the first single, due to another expensive video (this time, based on the film Mean Girls) and a big promotional tour across Spain, where Natalia sang live on many important TV shows. This album, however, was mainly based on rock music. It included a version of AC/DC's Highway to Hell. Natalia has appeared on many other artists albums. In 2004, she appeared on an album by Spanish singer Tony Aguilar on a song called Vuelve. With addition to this, Natalia has appeared on American rapper AT's album Electric Grease with the song \u201CI Love This Game\u201D. Natalia took a break for a year. However, in September 2005, she made her comeback. First of all, she came first in the Spanish reality TV program Gente de Primera, where celebrities take a member of the public and transform them into pop stars. In June 2006, Natalia released her fourth album, Nada es lo que crees (Nothing's What You Think). It got to number No.9, four places lower than 'Natalia'. The first single, \u201CLoco por m\u00ED\u201D (Mad About Me), got to No.1 in the Spanish chart, solely on Internet Downloads. In January 2007, half a year after the first single was released, it was announced that the second single would be A T\u00ED (To You). However, without a promotional video, it did not make the Spanish chart. In November 2007, Natalia returned with a new album, Radikal, and a new single, Rebelde en Libertad. Radikal debuted in the Spanish charts at 56. From 2010 to 2013, Natalia released six singles v\u00EDa Internet: the single \"Free Yourself\" and \"Ind\u00F3mita\" were huge hits."@en .

After releasing a platinum-selling compilation album in 2006, Knight went on to tour the UK with a reformed Take That.

She is an active campaigner for anti-Aids organisations such as the Stop AIDS Campaign and The Terrence Higgins Trust and is also a vocal campaigner against homophobic lyrics in urban music.

	dbo:abstract	"Parks was born in Philadelphia, the son of a psychiatrist. Carson's early musical training began as a student at the internationally acclaimed American Boychoir School (formerly known as The Columbus Boychoir School). After attending Phillips Academy in Andover, Massachusetts, the University of Miami and then Carnegie Mellon University, he began working in Los Angeles. In 1959, with college friend Bernie Armstrong, he formed the Steeltown Two and first recorded for the small Gini label. The duo also worked as one half of a reformed version of Terry Gilkyson's band, The Easy Riders, and in 1960 they performed on the soundtrack of the John Wayne film The Alamo. The pair also worked as The Kinsmen with singer Bud Dashiell, before Parks left in 1962. He then formed a new version of the Steeltown Two, with his younger brother, Van Dyke Parks, occasionally adding singer Pat Peyton as the Steeltown Three and the Southcoasters. Following the success of The New Christy Minstrels, Gilkyson and the Parks brothers then formed a choral group, The Greenwood County Singers, featuring five boys and two girls. They released four albums on Kapp Records between 1963 and 1965, later becoming known as The Greenwood Singers and finally The Greenwoods. The group had two minor hits, \"Please Don't Sell My Daddy No More Wine\" reaching #64 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1966, and included singer Gaile Foote, whom Carson Parks married."@en ;

He was born in 1955 in Caldwell, Idaho. His compositions include \"As Now We Take the Sacrament\" (Hymns 1985, no. 169), as well as \"A Young Man Prepared\" and \"The Shepherd's Carol\" (Children's Songbook pp. 166, 40, respectively). In 1996, Carter was commissioned to compose \"Come unto Christ, the Holy One of Israel\" for the LDS Church's 1997 Sesquicentennial Celebration. In 1993, he received a commission to compose \"Refuge and Rest,\" a multimedia oratorio to commemorate the July 1996 Sesquicentennial Celebration of Winter Quarters. Later that year \"Refuge and Rest\" was expanded to include the Mormon pioneers' exodus from Winter Quarters to the Salt Lake Valley. It was performed numerous times in Utah in 1997 under the title \"Seasons of Faith.\" Carter has contributed several dozen compositions to LDS Church magazines since the late 1970s. The Mormon Tabernacle Choir has performed and recorded some of his works including \"Come unto Him,\" \"The Pledge of Allegiance,\" and \"Come unto Christ, the Holy One of Israel.\" \"Shine for Me Again, Star of Bethlehem,\" a Christmas song collaboration in 1981 with lyricist Sherri Otteson Bird, remains a best seller throughout the LDS Church. Carter worked as a member of the LDS Church's General Music Committee from 1986 to 2004. He traveled to regional LDS Church music workshops speaking and teaching in many subject areas. He contributed an article on church music policy to the Ensign magazine. His choral group, \"Dan Carter Singers\", performed for approximately 10 years throughout Utah and other regional locations, in churches and communities. The group's focus was to perform new, inspiring LDS music. The group recorded one CD in 1996 titled, \"Come unto Him \u2014 Music by Dan Carter.\" Carter has approximately 500 pieces of music in print and continues to compose and publish. More recently his musical works focus on music for theatrical productions."@en ;

Although primarily remembered as a country music icon, his genre-spanning songs and sound embraced rock and roll, rockabilly, blues, folk, and gospel. This crossover appeal won Cash the rare honor of multiple inductions in the Country Music, Rock and Roll, and Gospel Music Halls of Fame. Cash was known for his deep, calm bass-baritone voice, the distinctive sound of his Tennessee Three backing band, a rebelliousness coupled with an increasingly somber and humble demeanor, free prison concerts, and a trademark look, which earned him the nickname \"The Man in Black\". He traditionally began his concerts with the simple \"Hello, I'm Johnny Cash\", followed by his signature \"Folsom Prison Blues\". Much of Cash's music contained themes of sorrow, moral tribulation and redemption, especially in the later stages of his career. His best-known songs included \"I Walk the Line\", \"Folsom Prison Blues\", \"Ring of Fire\", \"Get Rhythm\" and \"Man in Black\". He also recorded humorous numbers like \"One Piece at a Time\" and \"A Boy Named Sue\"; a duet with his future wife, June Carter, called \"Jackson\" (followed by many further duets after their marriage); and railroad songs including \"Hey, Porter\", \"Orange Blossom Special\" and \"Rock Island Line\". During the last stage of his career, Cash covered songs by several late 20th century rock artists, notably \"Hurt\" by Nine Inch Nails and \"Personal Jesus\" by Depeche Mode."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Juhani Juice Leskinen (former Pauli Matti Juhani \"Juice\" Leskinen), better known as Juice Leskinen (pronounced [\u02C8juis\u025B] , not like the English word juice; born 19 February 1950 in Juankoski \u2013 died 24 November 2006 in Tampere), was one of the most prominent Finnish singer-songwriters of the late 20th century. From the early 1970s onward he released nearly 30 full-length albums, as well as writing song lyrics for dozens of Finnish artists. Several of Leskinen's songs have reached classic status in Finnish popular music, e.g., \"Viidestoista y\u00F6\", \"Kaksoisel\u00E4m\u00E4\u00E4\" and \"Syksyn s\u00E4vel\". His early records are considered staples of the so-called Manserock movement of the mid-'70s. In addition to Leskinen's musical work, he extended his focus to poetry and playwriting with nine collections of verse and seven plays published. After moving to Tampere to study in 1970, Leskinen began his recording career in 1973 with the eponymous debut album of Juice Leskinen & Coitus Int. One more record, Per Vers, runoilija, was made under the same band name, but from then on he released records with several line-ups, most notably Juice Leskinen Slam and Juice Leskinen Grand Slam from the late1970s until the mid 1980s. Although concentrating more on poetry from the early 1990s, Leskinen still released new music every few years despite his failing health caused by years of unhealthy life habits. After the longest hiatus of his recording career, L marked Leskinen's 50th birthday in 2000. His last record, Senaattori ja boheemi (released in 2004), is a collaboration with Mikko Alatalo, a return to their partnership of the early 1970s. He wrote Nuku pommiin in 1982 for the Eurovision Song Contest. Juice Leskinen's most famous songs include \"Viidestoista y\u00F6\" (Fifteenth Night), \"Musta aurinko nousee\", \"Marilyn\", \"Rakkauden ammattilainen\" (Professional of Love) and \"Norjalainen villapaita\" (Norwegian cardigan). He qualified 38th in the poll of the 100 Greatest Finns held during the summer of 2004. Leskinen died in 2006 after suffering from renal insufficiency, cirrhosis and diabetes. He is buried in Kalevankangas cemetery, Tampere, near the main gate. Leskinen has gained a considerable amount of posthumous recognition. A musical about Leskinen, titled Juice - taiteilijael\u00E4m\u00E4\u00E4 (an artist's life) is under production, and premiered in Tampere on 30 August 2011.In 2015, two film companies announced they are planning a biography film. One of them changed plans later."@en ;

The power of Stubbs' emotional, often dramatic vocals have received praise from many critics over the years; for example, Allmusic's Ed Hogan has remarked that Stubbs' had a \"pleading urgency in his voice that perfectly captured the longing anxiousness of the songs written by the producing trio of Holland-Dozier-Holland\". As well, War band member Lonnie Jordan told Billboard.com he felt \"blessed\" to meet Stubbs and thought that the Four Tops singer's \"voice was so good he was just, like, from another planet.\" He was also a voice artist in film and animated television series, most famously having provided the voice of the alien plant in the 1986 comedic horror film Little Shop of Horrors (an adaption of the stage musical of the same name) as well as Mother Brain in the 1989 TV series Captain N: The Game Master. Stubbs was admired by his peers for his impressive vocal range, having influenced many later pop and soul artists such as Daryl Hall of Hall and Oates. Stubbs had five children. Living in Detroit, Michigan for much of his life, including his last days, he was married to Clineice Stubbs for over forty years until his death. His last performance was at the Four Tops' \"50th Anniversary Concert\" on July 28, 2004 at the Detroit Opera House."@en ;

He rose to fame in 2006 following the success of his debut album, Lupe Fiasco's Food & Liquor. He also performs as the frontman of rock band Japanese Cartoon under his real name. As an entrepreneur, Fiasco is the chief executive officer of 1st & 15th Entertainment. Raised in Chicago, Jaco developed an interest in hip hop after initially disliking the genre for its use of vulgarity and misogyny. After adopting the name Lupe Fiasco and recording songs in his father's basement, 19-year-old Fiasco joined a group called Da Pak. The group disbanded shortly after its inception, and Fiasco soon met rapper Jay-Z who helped him sign a record deal with Atlantic Records. In September 2006, Fiasco released his debut album Lupe Fiasco's Food & Liquor on the label, which received three Grammy nominations. He released his second album, Lupe Fiasco's The Cool, in December 2007. The lead single \"Superstar\" became his first top 40 hit on the Billboard Hot 100. After a two-year delay, Lasers was released in March 2011 to mixed reviews; however, it became his first album to debut at number one on the Billboard 200. His latest album, Tetsuo & Youth, was released in January 2015. In addition to music, Fiasco has pursued other business ventures, including fashion. He runs two clothing lines, Righteous Kung-Fu and Trilly & Truly; he has designed sneakers for Reebok. He has been involved with charitable activities, including the Summit on the Summit expedition, and in 2010 he recorded a benefit single for victims of the 2010 Haiti earthquake. Fiasco is also noted for his anti-establishment views, which he has expressed in both interviews and his music."@en ;

She found fame in the all-female R&B/garage trio Mis-Teeq. The trio disbanded in 2005 and Dixon pursued a music career as a solo artist, signing to Polydor Records. She began recording her debut solo album, Fired Up, in 2006, but due to poor record sales of her first two singles, \"Lipstick\" and \"Knockdown\", she was dropped from Polydor. In 2007, Dixon won Strictly Come Dancing. Her television exposure led to a successful comeback, which included her signing to Asylum Records, an offshoot of Warner Music Group. Dixon then released a second album, entitled The Alesha Show, in 2008, which received platinum certification from BPI in the UK and spawned four singles including \"The Boy Does Nothing\" and \"Breathe Slow\", the latter of which became her highest charting single and earned her a Brit Award nomination. In September 2009, Dixon became a judge on the seventh series of Strictly Come Dancing, replacing Arlene Phillips. The replacement of Phillips by Dixon attracted criticism, as some questioned the extent of Dixon's dancing knowledge.  In 2010, Dixon returned for the eighth series of Strictly Come Dancing and released her third studio album, The Entertainer. In January 2012, shortly after completing the ninth series and her third year as a judge on Strictly Come Dancing, Dixon quit to become a judge on Britain's Got Talent."@en ;

Suzuki attempted to resurrect her career under her own steam with two indie singles before signing to Avex Trax in 2005. She released \"Delightful\", a dance song that reached No. 3 on the Japanese Oricon charts with a style similar to electronic club music, significantly different from her pop idol days. Since her appearance in the 2006 film Rainbow Song, Suzuki has gradually made a name for herself in the acting field, starring in various movies, television series and musicals."@en ;

Agurbash was born in Minsk, Belarussian SSR, Soviet Union. In 1988, she won the first Miss Belarus title when she was a student of the Belarusian Academy of Arts. Between 1990 and 1995, she was in the band Verasy. In 1991, Angelica earned her second title \"Miss Photo USSR\" becoming the most photoed model in Belarus. After Angelica left Verasy, she has had numerous hit singles as well as releasing three albums - \"Paper Moon\", \"Night Without a Dream\" and \"For You\". In 2002, she presented her brand-new album \"The Farewell Kiss of Lika Yalinskaya\" the same year. Agurbash was the Belarusian Eurovision Song Contest entrant in 2005. Her original song, Boys and Girls, a rock ballad themed after the Beslan school hostage crisis, was chosen by a jury after a pre-selection vote by Belarusian viewers. However, due to the song's poor reception across Europe, the Belarusian state broadcaster decided in a highly unusual move to allow Angelica to sing a different song in Kiev. She ordered songs from two composers with successful Eurovision records: the Israeli author of 1998 winner Diva Svika Pick, and the author of Antique's hit Die For You Nikos Terzis. After long hesitation, Agurbash picked the Greek disco anthem Love Me Tonight. The song change succeeded in producing hype around the Belarusian entry, to which added also a transformer dress, inspired by Marie N's victory in 2002. She entered the show amongst the pre show favourites. However, in the contest she did not fare as well as expected, failing to make it past the semi-finals. \"Love Me Tonight\" ended 13th out of 25."@en ;

At the age of thirteen, Ueto made her acting debut, in the film Satsujinsha: Killer of Paraiso (1999), and she and fellow Japan Bish\u014Djo Contest participants, Mami Nejiki, Mai Fujiya, and Manami Nishiwaki, formed the unsuccessful idol group Z-1. In 2002, after their disbandment, Ueto continued her music career as a solo artist, under the record label Pony Canyon, where she debuted with the single \"Pureness.\" Ueto's breakthrough came when she was cast as a high school student suffering from gender dysphoria, in the sixth season of the long-running TBS drama 3-nen B-gumi Kinpachi-sensei. Her critically acclaimed performance led to several leading roles and endorsements, eventually establishing herself as one of Japan's most recognizable faces. As one of Japan's most ubiquitous celebrities, Ueto constantly appears on billboards, shop windows and train adverts, and has held the annual title of CM Queen five times since 2004. She has also ventured onto the big screen, in the lead role in Ryuhei Kitamura's blockbuster Azumi (2003), which earned her a Japan Academy Award for Best Actress nomination; its sequel, Azumi 2: Death or Love (2005); and the film adaption of Thermae Romae (2012)."@en ;

His principal instruments were banjo and 12-string guitar. He introduced a then-unknown Joan Baez at the Newport Folk Festival of 1959. He produced a number of LPs in the decade from 1956 to 1965. His best known album, Gibson & Camp at the Gate of Horn, was released in 1961. His songs have been recorded by, among others, the Limeliters, Peter, Paul and Mary, Simon & Garfunkel, the Byrds, the Smothers Brothers, Phil Ochs, and the Kingston Trio. His career was interrupted by his addiction to drugs and alcohol. After getting sober he attempted a comeback in 1978, but the musical scene had changed and his traditional style of folk music was out of favor with young audiences. He did, however, continue his artistic career with albums, musicals, plays, and television performances. In 1993 he was diagnosed with progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), and died of that disease at the age of 64."@en ;

Carlile garnered wider recognition for her 2007 single The Story, from the album of the same name, was a greater commercial success, and was used by General Motors for commercials. Carlile has released six albums including The Story (2007), Give Up the Ghost (2009) and Live at Benaroya Hall with the Seattle Symphony (2011), the last reaching number 14 on the Top Rock Albums chart. Her 2015 album The Firewatcher's Daughter garnered her further acclaim and her first Grammy Award nomination. Carlile's music through the years has been categorized in several genres, including pop, rock, alternative country, and folk. She said of her style, \"I've gone through all sorts of vocal phases, from pop to blues to R&B, but no matter what I do, I just can't get the country and western out of my voice.\" Carlile has been a part of several activism campaigns and advocates for causes ranging from spreading awareness for health issues to women empowerment."@en ;

Following the release of her debut album, she received numerous awards from different organizations and multiple album certifications by the Philippine Association of the Record Industry (PARI).

In the same year, she staged a Nina Live! concert at the Araneta Coliseum, which became her biggest solo concert to date. In 2006, she released her self-titled album, which earned her the most nominations (eight) for the Awit Awards. Later, she was criticized for releasing too many covers, and got in a feud with her ex-boyfriend Nyoy Volante's parents when she filed a lawsuit against them. She regained success in 2009 after performing and touring with the Sessionistas. In the same year, she released her last studio album under Warner, Renditions of the Soul, which was taken from her Wave 89.1 radio show of the same title. The album was both critically and commercially successful. She signed a recording deal with Universal Records in 2010, and represented her country in the Pattaya International Music Festival a year later. In a career spanning over a decade, Girado was cited as the artist who popularized the acoustic phenomenon in the Philippines. In 2004, the Philippine Business Excellence Award named her as the No. 1 Female R&B Singer in the country. In addition, MEGA listed her as One of the Women to Watch in 2004. In 2009, Nina Live! was certified Diamond by the PARI, becoming the fourth biggest-selling album in OPM history.
