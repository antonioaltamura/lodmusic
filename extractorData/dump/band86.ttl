	dbo:abstract	"Lostprophets /l\u0252st\u02C8pr\u0252f\u026Ats/ was a Welsh rock band from Pontypridd formed in 1997. Founded by lead vocalist Ian Watkins, bassist (later guitarist) Mike Lewis, drummer Mike Chiplin and guitarist Lee Gaze, they were originally a side-project to hardcore punk band Public Disturbance. They were also part of the Cardiff music scene. Lostprophets released five studio albums, with their final release Weapons released on 2 April 2012. The band achieved two Top 10 hits on the UK Singles Chart (\"Last Train Home\" and \"Rooftops\"), one number-one single on the US Alternative Songs chart (\"Last Train Home\"), several Kerrang! Awards and nominations, and sold 3.5 million albums worldwide. In December 2012, Watkins was charged with multiple sexual offences against children. The band cancelled all tour dates, and the other members announced the disbanding of Lostprophets in October 2013 before the end of Watkins' trial. Watkins pleaded guilty to several (but not all) charges in November 2013, and in December 2013 was sentenced to 29 years imprisonment plus six years on licence. In June 2014, the remaining members formed No Devotion with American singer Geoff Rickly as their lead vocalist."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Manic Street Preachers are a Welsh rock band formed in 1986 in Blackwood, Wales and consisting of James Dean Bradfield (lead vocals, lead guitar), Nicky Wire (bass guitar, lyrics) and Sean Moore (drums, percussion). They are often colloquially known as \"The Manics.\" After the release of their first single, \"Suicide Alley\", Richey Edwards joined the band as co-lyricist and rhythm guitarist. The band proclaimed their debut album Generation Terrorists would be the \"greatest rock album ever\" and hoped to sell sixteen million copies around the world, \"from Bangkok to Senegal\", after which they would split up. Despite the album's failure to meet this level of success, the band carried on with their career. The group later became a trio when Edwards disappeared on 1 February 1995. Bradfield, Moore and Wire went on to gain critical and commercial success. The band have released twelve albums and three compilations, Forever Delayed, Lipstick Traces (A Secret History of Manic Street Preachers) and National Treasures \u2013 The Complete Singles. Their early combination of androgynous glam imagery, critical social lyrics about \"culture, alienation, boredom and despair\" and a furious rock sound gained them a loyal following over the years and assured them a cult status. The band's later albums retained a leftist politicisation and intellectual lyrical style while adopting a broader alternative rock sound. To date, they have sold more than 10 million albums worldwide. Over their career the Manics have headlined several festivals including Glastonbury, T in the Park, V Festival and Reading. They have won eleven NME Awards, eight Q Awards and four BRIT Awards. The Manics were also nominated for the Mercury Prize in 1996 and 1999, and have had one nomination for the MTV Europe Music Awards. The group has reached number 1 in the UK charts three times: in 1998 with the album This Is My Truth Tell Me Yours, and the single \"If You Tolerate This Your Children Will Be Next\" and again in 2000 with the single \"The Masses Against the Classes\"."@en ;

The group mainly consisted of Stephen Malkmus (vocals and guitar), Scott Kannberg (guitar and vocals), Mark Ibold (bass), Steve West (drums) and Bob Nastanovich (percussion and vocals). Initially conceived as a recording project, the band at first avoided press or live performances, while attracting considerable underground attention with their early releases. Gradually evolving into a more polished band, Pavement recorded five full-length albums and nine EPs over the course of their decade-long career, though they disbanded with some acrimony in 1999 as the members moved on to other projects. In 2010, they undertook a well-received reunion tour. Though only briefly brushing the mainstream with the single \"Cut Your Hair\" in 1994, Pavement was a successful indie rock band. Rather than signing with a major label as many of their 1980s forebears had done, they remained signed to independent labels throughout their career and have often been described as one of the most influential bands to emerge from the American underground in the '90s. Some prominent music critics, such as Robert Christgau and Stephen Thomas Erlewine, went so far as to call them the best band of the 1990s. In their career, they also achieved a significant cult following."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Yazoo (known as Yaz in North America for legal reasons involving Yazoo Records) were a British synthpop duo from Basildon, Essex, England, consisting of former Depeche Mode member Vince Clarke (keyboards) and Alison Moyet (vocals). Formed in late 1981 after Clarke responded to an advertisement Moyet placed in a UK music magazine, over the next 18 months the duo made two critically acclaimed albums, Upstairs at Eric's and You and Me Both, blending Clarke's synthesizer melodies with Moyet's blues- and soul-influenced vocals. Yazoo enjoyed worldwide success, particularly in their home country where three of their four singles reached the top three of the UK Singles Chart and both their albums made the top two of the albums chart. In North America they are best known for the song \"Situation\", originally only a B-side in the UK but which was a club and airplay hit in the US and Canada before being released as the band's debut single in North America. Despite their success, the duo split acrimoniously in the spring of 1983 due to a combination of Clarke's reluctance to make more records under the Yazoo name, a clash of personalities, and a lack of communication between the pair. Clarke went on to form Erasure, another successful and longer-lasting synthpop duo, while Moyet embarked on a highly successful solo career. Although their musical career was short, Yazoo's combination of electronic instrumentation and soulful female vocals has been cited as an influence on the house music scene that emerged in the mid-1980s, as well as bands such as LCD Soundsystem (who name-checked them on their debut single \"Losing My Edge\"), Hercules and Love Affair (whose leader Andy Butler has said that \"Situation\" was his biggest musical inspiration as a child), La Roux, Shiny Toy Guns and Blaqk Audio. In 2008, 25 years after splitting up, Clarke and Moyet reconciled and reformed Yazoo to play a successful tour of the UK, Europe and North America in support of the reissue of Yazoo's two studio albums and a box set of their material. The pair briefly reunited again in May 2011 to play three Yazoo songs at a music festival organised by their record label."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Bananarama are a British female pop music vocal group formed in London in 1979 by friends Sara Dallin, Siobhan Fahey and Keren Woodward. Their success on both pop and dance charts have earned the group a listing in The Guinness Book of World Records as the all-female group with the most chart entries in the world, a record which they still hold. They released their debut single \"Aie a Mwana\" in 1981. The group's 10 UK Top 10 hits include \"It Ain't What You Do...\" (1982), \"Really Saying Something\" (1982), \"Shy Boy\" (1982), \"Na Na Hey Hey Kiss Him Goodbye\" (1983), \"Cruel Summer\" (1983), \"Robert De Niro's Waiting...\" (1984) and \"Love in the First Degree\" (1987). In 1986, they had a US number one with another of their UK Top 10 hits, \"Venus\". In total, they had 11 singles reach the US Billboard Hot 100 (1983-1988), including two more in the top 10, with \"Cruel Summer\" (1984) and \"I Heard a Rumour\" (1987). They are associated with the MTV-driven Second British Invasion of the US. In 1988, \"Love in the First Degree\" earned them a Brit Award nomination for Best British Single, while their fourth album Wow! (1987), topped the Australian ARIA albums chart. Their 1988 music video for the group's hit cover of The Supremes 1971 smash single \"Nathan Jones\" earned them another Brit Award nomination. Following Fahey's departure from the group in 1988, Jacquie O'Sullivan joined the group for three years and they had UK Top 10 hits with \"I Want You Back\" (1988) and \"Help!\" (1989). In addition to their chart success, the band is also known for their vocal style, generally singing in unison rather than in harmony like most vocal groups. Since 1992, Woodward and Dallin have continued Bananarama as a duo, with hits including \"Movin' On\" (1992) and \"More, More, More\" (1993). They returned to the UK Top 20 for the first time since 1991 with the 2005 single \"Move in My Direction\". Between 1982 and 2009, they had 28 singles reach the Top 50 of the UK singles chart."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Bon Jovi is an American rock band from Sayreville, New Jersey. Formed in 1983, Bon Jovi consists of lead singer and namesake Jon Bon Jovi (born John Francis Bongiovi, Jr.), pianist and keyboardist David Bryan, drummer Tico Torres, lead guitarist Phil X, and bassist Hugh McDonald. The band's lineup has remained mostly static during its history, with the only exceptions being the 1994 dismissal of bass player Alec John Such, who was unofficially replaced by Hugh McDonald, and the departure of longtime guitarist and co-songwriter Richie Sambora in 2013. Phil X and McDonald would later both become official members in 2016. In 1986, Bon Jovi achieved widespread global recognition with their third album, Slippery When Wet. The band's fourth album, New Jersey was equally successful in 1988. After touring and recording non-stop during the late 1980s, the band went on hiatus following the New Jersey Tour in 1990, during which time Jon Bon Jovi and Richie Sambora both released successful solo albums. In 1992, the band returned with the album Keep the Faith. Their 2000 single \"It's My Life\", which followed a second hiatus, successfully introduced the band to a younger audience. Bon Jovi have been known to use different styles in their music, which has included country for their 2007 album Lost Highway. On March 12, 2013, Bon Jovi released their 12th studio album, What About Now. Thus far, Bon Jovi has released 13 studio albums, plus two compilations and two live albums. The band has sold more than 130 million records worldwide and performed more than 2,700 concerts in over 50 countries for more than 34 million fans. Bon Jovi was inducted into the UK Music Hall of Fame in 2006. The band was also honored with the Award of Merit at the American Music Awards in 2004, and as songwriters and collaborators, Jon Bon Jovi and Richie Sambora were inducted into Songwriters Hall of Fame in 2009."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Dream Theater is an American progressive metal band formed in 1985 under the name Majesty by John Petrucci, John Myung, and Mike Portnoy while they attended Berklee College of Music in Massachusetts. They subsequently dropped out of their studies to concentrate further on the band that would ultimately become Dream Theater. Though a number of lineup changes followed, the three original members remained together along with James LaBrie and Jordan Rudess until September 8, 2010, when Portnoy left the band. In October 2010, the band held auditions for a drummer to replace Portnoy. Mike Mangini was announced as the new permanent drummer on April 29, 2011. The band is well known for the technical proficiency of its instrumentalists, who have won many awards from music instruction magazines. Guitarist John Petrucci has been named as the third player on the G3 tour six times, more than any invited players. In 2009 he was named the No. 2 best metal guitarist by Joel McIver in his book The 100 Greatest Metal Guitarists. He was also named as one of the \"Top 10 Fastest Shredders of All Time\" by GuitarOne magazine. Jordan Rudess is considered to be one of the greatest keyboard players of all time by many publications like MusicRadar. Former drummer Mike Portnoy has won 26 awards from Modern Drummer magazine and is also the second youngest person (at the age of 37) to be inducted into the Rock Drummer Hall of Fame. His replacement Mike Mangini has also previously set 5 WFD records. John Myung was voted the greatest bassist of all time in a poll conducted by MusicRadar in August through September 2010. The band was inducted into the Long Island Music Hall of Fame in 2010. The band's highest-selling album is the gold-selling Images and Words (1992), which reached No. 61 on the Billboard 200 chart. Both the 1994 release Awake and their 2002 release Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence also entered the charts at No. 32 and No. 46 respectively and received mostly positive reviews. Metropolis Pt. 2: Scenes from a Memory was ranked number 95 on the October 2006 issue of Guitar World magazine's list of The greatest 100 guitar albums of all time. It is ranked as the 15th Greatest Concept Album (as of March 2003) by Classic Rock Magazine and as the number one all-time progressive album by Rolling Stone (as of July 2012). Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence also led to Dream Theater becoming the initial band reviewed in the music section of Entertainment Weekly during its opening week of release, despite the magazine generally preferring more mainstream music. The band's eleventh studio album, A Dramatic Turn of Events, was released on September 13, 2011. On November 30, 2011, the album's lead single, \"On the Backs of Angels\", was nominated for a Grammy Award in the \"Best Hard Rock/Metal Performance\" category, marking the band's first ever Grammy nomination. Dream Theater's self-titled twelfth studio album was released on September 23, 2013 and earned their second Grammy Award nomination, this time for \u201CBest Metal Performance\u201D, for the album's first single, \"The Enemy Inside\". On April 9, 2013, Images and Words won Loudwire's fan voted March Metal Madness for world's best metal album beating albums by Dio, AC/DC, Judas Priest, Megadeth and Metallica. As of 2011, Dream Theater has sold over 12 million records worldwide."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Lost Dogs are an American musical supergroup formed in 1991, comprising vocalists, songwriters, and guitarists from multiple Christian alternative rock bands. Their current lineup includes Terry Scott Taylor (Daniel Amos, the Swirling Eddies), Michael Roe (The 77s), Derri Daugherty and Steve Hindalong (The Choir). The original lineup included Gene Eugene (Adam Again), who died in 2000. The band's eclectic blending of folk, blues, country, and rock has been characterized as \"a sort of CCM equivalent to the Traveling Wilburys\". The band released their debut album Scenic Routes in 1992 as a one-time collaboration. Lost Dogs concert performances are filled with between-song jokes and one-liners between the band members (usually poking fun at each other). Many Lost Dogs albums include at least one or two cover songs. Songs covered by Lost Dogs on an album or in concert include Bob Dylan's \"Lord Protect My Child\", Leonard Cohen's \"If It Be Your Will\", The Beatles' \"I'm A Loser\", \"The Chipmunk Song (Christmas Don't Be Late)\", and Stephen Foster's \"Hard Times, Come Again No More\". In March, 2000, shortly after the release of their Gift Horse album, Gene Eugene died. In 2004, the band got together with Steve Hindalong to produce a special album for their summer tour. The result was entitled MUTT, and included new acoustic versions of ten songs originally written and recorded for each band member's regular rock bands. The following year, the band would release the almost entirely instrumental Island Dreams. The Lost Cabin and the Mystery Trees, was released July 2006. In 2008, the Lost Dogs traveled down historic Route 66 with cinematographer Jimmy Abegg. Abegg filmed the band's experiences. The band then wrote and recorded 14 songs inspired by their journey, which was released as Old Angel in May 2010."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Nine Inch Nails (abbreviated NIN; stylized as NI\u0418) is an American industrial rock band, founded in 1988 by Trent Reznor in Cleveland, Ohio. As its main producer, singer, songwriter, and instrumentalist, Reznor is the only official member of the group and remains solely responsible for its direction. Nine Inch Nails' music straddles a wide range of genres. After recording a new album, Reznor usually assembles a live band to perform with him. The touring band features a revolving lineup that often rearranges songs to fit a live setting. On stage, Nine Inch Nails often employs visual elements to accompany performances, which frequently include light shows. Underground music audiences warmly received Nine Inch Nails in its early years. Reznor produced several highly influential records in the 1990s that achieved widespread popularity: many Nine Inch Nails songs became radio hits; and their entire catalog has reached record sales exceeding over 20 million albums worldwide, with 10 million sales certified in the United States alone. In 1997, Reznor appeared in Time magazine's list of the year's most influential people, and Spin magazine described him as \"the most vital artist in music.\"In 2004, Rolling Stone placed Nine Inch Nails at 94 on its list of the 100 greatest artists of all time. Despite this acclaim, the band has had several feuds with the corporate side of the recording industry. In 2007, these corporate entanglements resulted in Reznor announcing that Nine Inch Nails would split from its label and release future material independently. Since 1989, Nine Inch Nails has released eight studio albums. After a hiatus from 2009 to 2013, Nine Inch Nails released Hesitation Marks, through Columbia Records. Prior to this, Ghosts I\u2013IV and The Slip were both independently released in digital form, with physical releases coming later. The digital release of the latter was made available completely free of charge, and the former, while also available for sale, can be acquired legally through means such as file-sharing due to its Creative Commons license. Nine Inch Nails has been nominated for thirteen Grammy Awards and won twice for the songs \"Wish\" and \"Happiness in Slavery\", in 1992 and 1996 respectively. In 2014, Nine Inch Nails was named as nominees for induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, their first year of eligibility. In 2015, they were nominated a second time."@en ;

It started out on the blogging platform Livejournal, but has now moved to its own dedicated website. The ACT-I-VATE collective features serialized graphic novels from over twenty-five hand-picked professional cartoonists (each of whom generally adds a new episode weekly), and is updated daily. ACT-I-VATE's artists are unpaid, and produce their work without editorial oversight. ACT-I-VATE is also free to view. In addition to the high-quality comics, the site is known for its vocal community of readers and the lengthy discussion threads between artist and reader. ACT-I-VATE debuted on February 1, 2006, with eight cartoonists, and added four more members on April 5, 2006. Since then, the collective has added new hand-picked cartoonists at a regular rate to achieve its current membership. ACT-I-VATE rose to prominence when many of its artists, including Haspiel, Michel Fiffe, Mike Cavallaro, Dan Goldman, and Nick Bertozzi, began to receive publishing deals. Haspiel and Fiffe's three-issue mini-series, Brawl, a \"creature romance double feature\" featuring Haspiel's \"Immortal\" (starring Billy Dogma) and Fiffe's \"Panorama,\" which both originated on ACT-I-VATE, was published by Image Comics in the Fall of 2007. Similarly, Parade (with Fireworks), by Mike Cavallaro, began on ACT-I-VATE, was first excerpted in New York Magazine, and later published by Image.

	dbo:abstract	"Breakfast with Amy was an Alternative Christian rock band that formed in 1986 in La Habra, California at the La Habra Four-Square church. At that time, the band consisted of vocalist David Koval, bassist Jeff \"Tennessee Beans\" Beahn, guitarist Christopher Colbert, and drummer Paul Pellegrin. The pastor of the church was throwing a Saturday night concert. A band had backed out and he needed a replacement. David, Christopher, Paul and Jeff quickly formed \"Friends of Amy\" to perform. The band was later joined by Caryn Barker (married the guitarist Christopher Colbert about 1989, divorced about 1996) and Charlotte Stripland on bass. Charlotte was later permanently replaced in 1989 by Bob \"Edwin\" Wohler. Brothers Eric and Jeremy Wood filled in on Bass and Drums respectively in the final days of the band. The band initially released an independent demo tape in 1987. It featured 3 songs (Funeral, Ferris Wheel and Love Song) and was recorded at Half Moon Studio by engineer Dan Bush. For the demo, the line-up featured Rich Berger on Drums. In 1988 the band released a professionally recorded demo tape (see side B of the Narrowpath release). In 1989, Breakfast with Amy was approached by Greg Sostrom of Narrowpath Records and subsequently signed by him in 1990. This led to the formal release of their studio album Everything Was Beautiful and Nothing Hurt. The album was recorded at Casbah studios in Fullerton, California during two sessions about a year apart. The A side featured new material recorded at the time the band signed with Narrowpath Records of Concord, California. It was produced by the legendary Chaz Ramierez known for his work in the Orange County New Wave and Punk scenes. The B side featured their first studio tracks (previously sold at concerts). After limited release through Narrowpath, the band signed with Michael Knott's Blonde Vinyl Records in 1991. With a new label that could better represent the band's progressive music and image, Breakfast with Amy quickly moved to the forefront of the underground Christian rock scene that had been taking shape in Southern California since the early 80's. During the short lifespan of Blonde Vinyl, Breakfast with Amy released 2 studio albums. After the collapse of Blonde Vinyl Records (largely due to a poor distribution network, ill equipped to handle \"new\" music in the Gospel market) the band dissolved. In 1995, they released their final album (a live compilation), Live At The Hawleywould Bowl!, under Flying Tart Records. The band never truly found a mainstream audience in or out of Christian circles. In 1995, Gray Dot records re-released their first album with completely re-mastered tracks andfour bonus demo tracks (culled from their original demo). Today, Breakfast with Amy is remembered by fans of the fledgling alternative Christian rock scene as oneof the staples of Blonde Vinyl Records, being present on nearly all of their compilation CDs (as well as other alternative Christian rock compilations) and being one of only a few artists on the label to make a music video. For those lucky enough to have seen them live, the band may be best remembered for their outlandish stage shows. A typical performance featured costumes, Go go dancing, flaming taxidermy, and movie projectors used as stage lighting. Shows often ended with instrument destruction and a 5 minute wall of feedback. Due to these factors, the band was rarely invited back to a venue be it a club or a church. Stylistically, the band is best described as Post-punk, mixing elements of Psychedelic rock, Art rock, and Punk rock into an odd amalgam. Some of the songs have decidedly Pop music melodies, while others feature layer after layer of guitar dissonance and feedback. Musical influences include U2, Echo & the Bunnymen, Sonic Youth, The Who, The Ramones, The Sex Pistols and The New York Dolls."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Coverdale\u2022Page was a musical collaboration featuring Whitesnake and former Deep Purple lead vocalist David Coverdale, and former Led Zeppelin guitarist Jimmy Page. The project between the two artists commenced in 1991 at the suggestion of American A&R executive John Kalodner, as both artists were signed to Geffen Records at the time in North America. Their debut album, Coverdale/Page was released on 15 March 1993, reaching No. 4 in the UK and No. 5 on the US Billboard 200 chart. Five singles were released to promote the album: \"Pride and Joy\", \"Shake My Tree\", \"Take Me for a Little While\", \"Take a Look at Yourself\" and \"Over Now\". The album was certified Gold by the RIAA for sales of the LP, CD & Cassette in excess of 500,000 copies and eventually went Platinum. The album also received the official Japanese Sony Music in-house award for sales in excess of 150,000 copies in Japan as well as the EMI in-house sales award for sales in excess of 60,000 copies in the UK. Prior to the formation of the duo, Page's former Led Zeppelin bandmate Robert Plant had been reluctant to reunite with Page. In interviews at the time, Plant expressed some derision at the guitarist's collaboration with Coverdale, referring to the project as \u2018David Cover-version\u2019. An American arena tour was planned for the summer of 1993, but after sluggish ticket sales the tour was scrapped in favour of a series of concerts in Japan, after which the partnership was dissolved. Page subsequently teamed up with Plant for an \"UnLedded\" MTV project and Coverdale returned to Whitesnake."@en ;

The project's first EP, V\u00EAn, was released in 2003. V\u00EAn was a studio project of Glanzmann's, but its success led to the recruitment of a full band. The band then released a full-length album, Spirit, in June 2006. In November 2007, Eluveitie was signed by Nuclear Blast. The group rose to fame following the release of their first major-label album, Slania, in February 2008. The album peaked at number 35 in the Swiss charts and number 72 in the German charts. Eluveitie describe themselves as \"The new wave of folk metal\". The band's style incorporates characteristics of melodic death metal combined with the melodies of traditional Celtic music. They use traditional European instruments, including the hurdy-gurdy and bagpipes, amidst guitars and both clean and harsh vocals. Their lyrics include references to Celtic mythology, particularly the Celtic Gaul village. The lyrics are often in the extinct ancient language Gaulish. The name of the band comes from graffiti on a vessel from Mantua (ca. 300 BC). The inscription in Etruscan letters reads eluveitie, which has been interpreted as the Etruscan form of the Celtic (h)elvetios (\u201Cthe Helvetian\u201D), presumably referring to a man of Helvetian descent living in Mantua."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Ivanushki International (written in Russian as \"\u0418\u0432\u0430\u043D\u0443\u0448\u043A\u0438 International\") is a Russian boy band founded in Moscow in 1994. The group was conceived by record producer Igor Matviyenko, and initially consisted of Andrei Grigoriev-Apollonov, Kirill Andreev, and primary vocalist Igor Sorin. They performed under several names (such as \"Apollo-Soyuz\") before settling on \"Ivanushki International\", a name meant to represent their intended blend of Russian (\"Little Ivans\") and international influences, and itself written half in Cyrillic, half in the Latin alphabet, with the second word read as in English. Their debut album, \u041A\u043E\u043D\u0435\u0447\u043D\u043E \u043E\u043D (Konyechno on, Of Course It's Him), was released in 1996. It included three cover versions of songs from the 1980s \u2013 \"\u0412\u0441\u0435\u043B\u0435\u043D\u043D\u0430\u044F\" (Vselennaya, \"The Universe\"), originally performed by Alexander Ivanov, and \"\u0420\u043E\u043D\u0434\u043E\" (Rondo, \"Roundabout\"), \"\u042D\u0442\u0430\u0436\u0438\" (Etazhi, \"Levels\"), and \"\u041C\u0430\u043B\u0438\u043D\u0430\" (\"Malina\", \"Rasberry\") by the group Class. However, it contained several original songs, including the hits \"\u0422\u0443\u0447\u0438\" (Tuchi, \"Clouds\"), \"\u041A\u043E\u043B\u0435\u0447\u043A\u043E\" (Kolechko, \"The Ring\"), \"\u0413\u0434\u0435-\u0442\u043E\" (Gdye-to, \"Somewhere\"), and \"\u041E\u043D\u0430\" (Ona, \"She\"). A remixed version of the album followed one year later, Konyechno on remixed. The remixes were created by Lubeh keyboardist Igor Polonsky, Moral Code X keyboardist Konstantin Smirnov, and DJ Maxim Milyutenko. Alongside the remixed versions, the album contained the new hit \"\u041A\u0443\u043A\u043B\u0430\" (Kukla, \"Doll\") and a cover version of the Lubeh song \"\u0414\u0443\u0441\u044F\" (Dusya). Ivanushki's second studio album, \u0422\u0432\u043E\u0438 \u043F\u0438\u0441\u044C\u043C\u0430 (Tvoi pisma, Your Letters), released later in 1997, repeated the existing formula of original material and covers of past hits. It also included an audio letter from the group. Later that year, Igor Sorin left to pursue a solo career, and was replaced by Oleg Yakovlev, who had appeared in the music video for \"Doll\". Without Sorin, the group continued its string of successes, releasing its perhaps best known song \"\u0422\u043E\u043F\u043E\u043B\u0438\u043D\u044B\u0439 \u043F\u0443\u0445\" (Topoliny pukh, \"Poplar Fuzz\"), a number-one hit in the summer of 1998. On September 1, 1998, Sorin committed suicide, jumping from the window of his high-rise apartment, and died three days later. The following year, the group released \u0424\u0440\u0430\u0433\u043C\u0435\u043D\u0442\u044B \u0436\u0438\u0437\u043D\u0438 (Fragmenti iz zhizni, Fragments of Life), their tribute to him, which contained songs he had written prior to joining Ivanushki, as well as poems he had written, and a song dedicated to him, \"\u042F \u0442\u0435\u0431\u044F \u043D\u0438\u043A\u043E\u0433\u0434\u0430 \u043D\u0435 \u0437\u0430\u0431\u0443\u0434\u0443\" (Ya tyebya nikogda nye zabudu, \"I Will Never Forget You\"). Ivanushki released their first full album with Yakovlev as vocalist, \u041E\u0431 \u044D\u0442\u043E\u043C \u044F \u0431\u0443\u0434\u0443 \u043A\u0440\u0438\u0447\u0430\u0442\u044C \u0432\u0441\u044E \u043D\u043E\u0447\u044C (Ob etom ya budu krichat' vsyu noch, I'll Shout About This All Night ), in April 1999. Recorded from August to November the previous year, it also contained singles such as \"Topoliny pukh\" that had already been released. It was followed in 2000 by \u041F\u043E\u0434\u043E\u0436\u0434\u0438 \u043C\u0435\u043D\u044F\u2026 (Podoshdi menya, Wait for Me), after which the group released their first compilation album, Ivanushki.Best.Ru."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"The Jake White Project was a short-lived New Jersey band that recorded three albums between 2004 and 2006. The Jake White Project (aka JWP) was formed in 2004 in Whippany, New Jersey. It was the brainchild of Jake White, a songwriter from Millburn, New Jersey who had previously played in local bands Blue Eclipse and Stinson. He was joined by two high school friends; guitarist Doug Atkins and drummer Karim Faris, along with guitarist Greg Sierpowski and keyboardist Faris Faris (brother of Karim). Once recording commenced, singer-songwriter Liliana Rose sang a few songs on the debut. The band's first album, Recreation, was released in June 2004. Shortly before the album tour, Sandra Myers took over as female lead vocalist. JWP members Jake White and Faris Faris were contracted to write songs for two independent movie releases by film company New Generation Cinema in 2004.[1] In May 2005, the band released its sophomore effort, Southbound, followed by another summer tour. After the tour, both Faris brothers, Atkins, and Myers left the group. White and Sierpowski acted as a duo in making the third (and final) Jake White Project album, On My Own, in June 2006. Following the release of the album, the group formally disbanded. White and Sierpowski both went on to record their respective solo material. Atkins now plays with up and coming singer/songwriter Jessica Rose and DiTaranto is with New York metal band Forsakken."@en ;

	foaf:name	"Kill II This"@en ;
	dbo:abstract	"Kill II This (sometimes typeset as Kill 2 This) are a Metal band from Manchester, England. KILL II THIS blend extreme metal music with elements of industrial electronica, hip-hop and even opera. Terrorizer magazine summed it up by saying, \"Their sound crosses clever industrial style sampling with fearsome guitar. Kill II This have created a beast which is threatening yet danceable.\" They experienced the highs of critical acclaim and prestigious tours. They also had to deal with forced line up changes, which from time to time tested the band's resolve. But with guitarist Mark Mynett at the helm they carried on regardless, creating one innovative album after another. The first album, \"Another Cross II Bare,\" was released in 1997 and featured Jeff Singer (drums), Pete Stone (Bass) and Nick Arlea (vocals). KILL II THIS supported GRIP INC. and SKINLAB for some UK dates in June 1997 then MEGADETH on their \"Cryptic Writings\" European tour. In 1998 the second album, \"Deviate,\" was released to huge praise from press and fans alike. Matt Pollock and Caroline Campbell were recruited for vocal and bass duties, while Ben Calvert replaced Jeff Singer on drums for touring duties after the album had been recorded. Metal Hammer's review said, \"Here is an album brimming with deflowered gems; downbeat riffs that don't depress and confident grooves.\" 2000 saw KILL II THIS out on a British tour supported by EARTHTONE 9 and LINEA 77. The band's third effort, \"Trinity,\" featured FEAR FACTORY frontman Burton C. Bell guesting on the cover of FRANKIE GOES TO HOLLYWOOD's \"Two Tribes.\" The band was confirmed as support to the GODFLESH and DEVIN TOWNSEND package tour of Britain during December 2001. They would also open for SOIL's UK debut gig in January 2002. Kerrang! said, \" Kill II This set about putting the last 20 years of heavy guitar music into a blender, and arrive at a sound that puts them out as one of THE most cutting edge bands around.\" The fourth album, 2003's 'Mass.[Down.]-Sin.(Drone) was recorded with vocalist Phil Bretnall and drummer Steve Rooney. Pete Stone returned on bass. European tours with Anthrax, Fear Factory, Type O Negative, Slipknot and Machine Head followed as well as a headline European tour with Area 54 as support. In the Spring of 2004 Mark Mynett revealed that the fifth KILL II THIS album would be the band's last. However, plans for the swan song KILL II THIS outing took on a new direction when the record, entitled, \"A New Spiritual Mountain,\" was released under the brand new band name CITY OF GOD. This new outfit comprised Jeff Singer, fresh from his stints with PARADISE LOST and BLAZE, Simon Gordon, ex-XENTRIX / Hellfighter, and Tim Preston, ex-DEARLY BEHEADED. The band didn't tour in support of this album and it seemed KILL II THIS had indeed come to an end. Mark Mynett is now a Senior Lecturer in Music Technology & Production at the University of Huddersfield and currently resides in Manchester, England. Mynett has recently had the cover feature published in November 2009's issue of Sound on Sound magazine where he discusses 'Extreme Metal Production'. Mynett still actively produces albums from his studio in Huddersfield, England."@en ;

By the time they began working on their second album, II, Europe had reunited, and Last Autumn's Dream had to replace Lev\u00E9n, Haugland and Michaeli with Marcel Jacob (Talisman), Jamie Borger (Talisman, Treat) and Thomas Lassar (Crystal Blue), respectively. II was released in 2005. Thomas Lassar left the band after II, paring the band down to a quartet. The band then released the albums Winter in Paradise in 2006 and Saturn Skyline in 2007.

They formed in 2004 as the trio of Fay Davis-Jeffers on keyboard and vocals, former founding member of Alkaline Trio Rob Doran on bass, and Butchy Fuego on drums. Their sound is very atmospheric and has a dark ambience that is similar to other instrumental avant-garde groups. Much of the group's offerings are rhythmically complex as well. The vocals offered by Fay give the band a well rounded sound like that of another female fronted indie band, the Fiery Furnaces, whom Pit er Pat toured with in the winter of 2007. The group released nine records between 2004\u20132008, touring extensively throughout the United States, Europe, and Mexico. After the album \"High Time\" was released in October 2008, Doran left the group for other pursuits. In the spring of 2009, Fuego and Davis-Jeffers toured as a duo for the first time, performing all new music. The tour included a performance at All Tomorrow's Parties festival in Minehead, England. In 2004, Pit er Pat performed on the second volume of the Burn to Shine DVD series. On July 7, 2007 Butchy Fuego participated in the Yamantaka Eye (Boredoms) lead drum collaboration/concert 77 Boadrum at Empire-Fulton Ferry State Park in Brooklyn, New York. On their 2007 Covers EP, Pit er Pat had guest instrumentalist add some woodwind and brass to their sound.

A key artist in \"VIA\" (vocal-instrumental ensemble) wave of Soviet music, it was one of the first officially state-recognized bands to feature elements of rock music in USSR. Zemlyane used to mix hard rock music with synthpop, and Zemlyane's frontman Sergey Skachkov plays keytar. Most of their lyrics deal with risk, courage, and masculinity. They sang about cosmonauts, stunts, pilots, and sailors. In 2010, their 1980s hit \"Trava u doma\" (\"Grass by the Home\") was awarded with the official status of the first anthem of Russian cosmonautics. Russian cosmonauts have traditionally taken this song with them getting assigned for orbital deployments.

Formed in 1991, the group is known for their consistently hook-laden song structures, characterized by blast beats, complex riffing, slam riffs and heavy breakdowns. Additionally, their reality-based lyrics characterized by political/modern themes are notable in death metal. Various line-up changes throughout the years have left John Gallagher the remaining original member, as well as the band's driving force. According to Gallagher, the band name was chosen while the members were of adolescent ages and was intended to be offensive."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Josh Joplin Group was an American Georgia-based folk rock band led by singer-songwriter Josh Joplin. Joplin brought the group its trademark combination of introspective lyrics, catchy melodies, and lead vocals that, to many, sound identical to those of R.E.M. singer Michael Stipe (to the point that one Joplin song, \"Happy at Last,\" begins, \"I sound like Michael Stipe and I dream like Carl Jung\"). After releasing two independent albums - Projector Head and Boxing Nostalgic - under the name Josh Joplin Band, the group signed to Artemis Records and released Useful Music in 2001. Produced largely by Shawn Mullins, the album received strong reviews but failed to make much commercial impact. It did, however, spawn a mild hit in \"Camera One,\". Featuring a more rock-edged, radio-friendly sound than most of the material on Useful Music, the song peaked at #22 on the Billboard Adult Top 40 chart in 2001, and was featured in an episode of the comedy series Scrubs (season 1, episode 7, \"My Super Ego\"). In September 2002, Josh Joplin Group released its second major-label album, The Future That Was. On this record, Joplin's lyrics were noticeably more clever and playful than on Useful Music, with subject matter including the nature of popularity (\"The Wonderful Ones\"), the absurdity of snobbery among music lovers (\"It's Only Entertainment\"), and the uselessness of trying to predict the future (\"The Future That Was\"). The musical styles were similarly varied, ranging from slow piano- and acoustic guitar-driven pop to upbeat keyboard- and electric guitar-based rock. Like its predecessor, The Future That Was received critical acclaim but sold poorly. Artemis released two singles from the album, \"I Am Not the Only Cowboy\" and \"Wonder Wheel,\" but neither one took off. In the fall of 2003, the band announced that it was breaking up and would play its final two shows in Atlanta in December of that year."@en ;

The Evin sisters announced that as of late 2006 the band was considered on hiatus due to the loss of Burns and Warrington, but with the addition of two new members in early 2007, the band was in the process of rebuilding. The band announced its return in 2009, and released their third album Tigerlily independently in Canada on 24 August 2010, after their original label Maverick folded in 2006."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"AfterImage is a Filipino rock band who was active in the 1990s. They disbanded in 2001 after 11 years as a band, having released three studio albums. After disbanding, Wency Cornejo, the band's vocalist, pursued a solo career. AfterImage was the band behind the commercially popular songs \"Habang May Buhay\" (While There's Life), \"Next in Line\", and \"Mangarap Ka\" (Dream). In 2008, the band reunited and released their fourth studio album. The band's first album, entitled Touch the Sun, was released in 1992 on Dyna Records (now Dyna Music). Among the eight songs that the album contained, four were released as singles: \"Bai (Sa Langit ang Ating Tagpuan)\", \"Only You\", \"Next in Line\", and \"Pagtawid\". The title of the album, which was the concluding part of the lyric to \"Next in Line\", was said to have just been a spontaneous utter of phrase which Cornejo made during the recording session for the said song. The band, having thought that the phrase, \"touch the sun\" had captured the essence and concept of the entire album, prompted them to use it as the album's title. The recurrent theme of the songs in the album was a personal expression of hopes, frustrations, and self-renewal - which the band hoped to touch not only their own lives but also the lives of other people. The album is also said to be a celebration of about 4 years of musical experimentation. According to them, \"It is quite difficult to put all the songs in the album in one perspective, considering they encompass so many growths the band has undergone.\""@en ;

Crass popularised the anarcho-punk movement of the punk subculture, advocating direct action, animal rights, feminism and environmentalism. The band used and advocated a DIY punk ethic approach to its sound collages, leaflets, albums and films. Crass spray-painted stencilled graffiti messages in the London Underground system and on advertising billboards, coordinated squats and organised political action. The band expressed its ideals by dressing in black, military-surplus-style clothing and using a stage backdrop amalgamating icons of perceived authority such as the Christian cross, the swastika, the Union Jack and the ouroboros. The band was critical of punk subculture and youth culture in general. Crass promoted an anarchism which became more common in the punk-music scene. They are considered art punk in their use of tape collages, graphics, spoken word releases, poetry and improvisation."@en ;

dbr:Klaudt_Indian_Family	rdf:type	dbo:Band ;
	foaf:name	"The Klaudt Indian Family"@en ;
	dbo:abstract	"The Klaudt Indian Family was a professional southern gospel group. They were noted as being one of the most diverse groups to ever travel the gospel music circuits. Reverend Reinhold Klaudt was a German cattleman who married Lillian White Corn Little Soldier of the Arikara-Mandan tribe of Indians. She was a direct descendant of one of General Custer's scouts at the Battle of Little Big Horn and also a descendant of Chief Sitting Bull. Their story began on the Fort Berthold Indian Reservation in North Dakota. Together, they raised a family dedicated to spreading the gospel through song. Originally from \"the badlands of North Dakota,\" the Klaudt Indian Family traveled the countryside spreading the gospel. The Klaudts were members of the Church of God, and the Klaudts desired for their children to be educated in that faith at the Bible Training School in Cleveland, Tennessee. All of the children received their formal education there, where they expanded their musical abilities. The family consisted of Vernon, Melvin, Raymond, and Ken and their sister Ramona. The Klaudt Indian Family began performing with Mom and Dad Klaudt, Vernon, Ramona, and Melvin. The other siblings joined the group as the years passed. Dad Klaudt left the performing group after several years to concentrate on being the business manager for the group. The Klaudts settled in the Atlanta area and soon began traveling across the country holding revival services and singing in gospel concerts. The Klaudt Indian Family featured various instruments in their program including the upright bass, trumpet, tenor saxophone, baritone saxophone, trombone, and piano. Their music had a jazz flavor that helped open doors to the group previously unknown to the typical gospel quartet. They were also one of the first gospel singing aggregations to use a custom designed motor coach in their travels and also used semi-trucks to haul tent equipment that would expand to a seating capacity of 3,000. The gospel music audiences in the early years must have been taken aback at the performances of the Klaudt Indian Family. While all the other groups in gospel music were using only a piano for their accompaniment, the Klaudts would showcase their music with strings and horns. Not only did their instrumentation set them apart from the norm, but they often performed in elaborate Native American costumes. This unique presentation allowed them to appear in many venues across the country. They quickly became a fixture on the Wally Fowler All Night Singing programs. It has been said that the Klaudt Indian Family was the first nationally known gospel music group, due to their engagements throughout the country. In addition to gospel concerts and church venues, they played engagements in Las Vegas, state fairs, professional sports games, and theme parks. In their heyday, they would typically play more than 400 dates a year. In addition to their singing, the Klaudt Indian Family also had their own recording label. They recorded several other gospel groups on their Family Tone label, and published sheet music and song folios to distribute to the gospel music community. The Klaudt Indian Family demonstrated their versatility in their musical arrangements as they would perform in various aggregations including a male quartet, mixed trio, male trio, duets, solos, and instrumentals in their programs and on their recordings. Solos by Mom Klaudt backed by her boys highlighted each Klaudt Indian Family performance. Television was a vital part in the growing popularity of the Klaudt Indian Family. They were fixtures on the syndicated program, Bob Poole's Gospel Favorites. The Klaudt Indian Family traveled as a group for more than five decades before retiring in the early 1980s. The Klaudts came out of retirement to perform for the last time on the stage of the Grand Ole Gospel Reunion in 1996 which featured Mom Klaudt at age 90. Mom Klaudt died in March 2001 and Dad died about four months later. Mrs. Klaudt was inducted into the Southern Gospel Music Association Hall of Fame in 2004. Most of her family was there to share in this honor. According to the website SoGospelNews.com, Vernon Klaudt, the oldest remaining member of the Klaudt Indian Family died September 9, 2006 At 4:45 PM. Vernon succumbed to the disease of cancer that wracked his body for over eight years. During his last months he found time to travel in and around Atlanta, Georgia. His last ministerial effort was to raise the necessary monies to pay the 2006-2007 winter heat bill for the Fort Berthold Reservation's Indian Mission. This mission was very close to the heart of Vernon, for many of his immediate and extended Indian family received their salvation experience in this little mission. The siblings are all still living and involved in various business ventures. They continue to keep the ministry of the Klaudt Indian Family alive. They have established the Klaudt Indian Memorial Foundation to fund scholarships through Lee University in Cleveland, Tennessee and the New Orleans Baptist Theological Seminary in New Orleans, Louisiana. The purpose of the scholarships is to honor the heritage and legacy of Mom and Dad Klaudt and to promote the teaching of gospel music to a new generation. On November 24, 2007 the Klaudt Indian Family was inducted into the Atlanta Country Music Hall of Fame and \"Lillian Little Soldier Klaudt\" was inducted into the Southern Gospel Museum and Hall of Fame. On August 24, 2008 the Klaudt Indian Family received the \"Lifetime Achievement Award\" presented by the Atlanta Society of Entertainers. During the year of 2010 The Klaudt Indian Family, through their 501 (c) 3 Public Charity, the \"Klaudt Indian Memorial Foundation\" is producing a TV Ministry. The TV Ministry entitled, Just Keep Singing, is presently viewed through several TV outlets in Georgia. The TV program is produced in the studios of TV 57 WATC Atlanta Georgia. Melvin Klaudt, host of the program uses, not only the Klaudts videos, but also features some of the legendary groups of the past along with many of the present day Southern Gospel Groups. The television program is now viewed world wide throughout their collaboration with aic-TV. aic-TV is an American Indian ministry out of Oklahoma City, Oklahoma."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"The Apolinario Mabini Hiking Society, later popularly known as APO Hiking Society, or simply APO, was a Filipino musical group. The group had its fledgling beginnings in 1969 at the Ateneo de Manila high school, with 15 members: John Paul Micayabas, Lito de Joya, Sonny Santiago, Gus Cosio, Renato Garcia, Chito Kintanar, Kenny Barton, Bruce Brown, Butch Dans, Kinjo Sawada, Ric Segreto, Goff Macaraeg, Doden Besa, Jim Paredes, and Boboy Garovillo. The group's name was created from the acronym AMHS representing their school with a witty twist having an irreverent reference to the paralyzed Philippine revolutionary intellectual and hero, Apolinario Mabini, and later shortened to \"Apo\", an Ilocano term for a wise man or a Tagalog term of grandchildren, and later re-branded to \"APO\" (all caps). Contrary to popular belief, the \"Apo\" name was not a reference to the Philippines's highest peak, the potentially-active stratovolcano Mount Apo. As the students advanced into college, Danny Javier joined the group. After graduation, the majority of its members left to pursue individual careers, with only three members remaining, made up of Jim Paredes, Boboy Garovillo and Danny Javier. In the span of their professional career, Apo emerged as a principal adherent of the musical movement termed Original Pilipino Music (a.k.a. OPM), a milieu in which their original musical contributions and cultural influence became essential. The Apo became involved in record production, talent management and organizing artists under the Organisasyon ng Pilipinong Mang-aawit (O.P.M., acronym translation: \"Organization of Philippine Singers/musicians\"). The group expanded its activities into establishing and furthering the careers of new OPM artists in the Philippines. To date, the group has released 27 albums in four decades of its career. Two hugely successful tribute albums were produced in 2006 and 2007 by its management group, featuring numerous young bands freshly reinterpreting Apo's expansive repertoire. The group frequently utilized their brand name, \"Apo,\" as a clever component for Tagalog puns in titles for television shows, live programs and marketing materials, for example, as in nA PO, which transliterates as \"already\" (polite/formal usage), and also as ap\u00F3 (meaning, \"grandchild\"). The puns have been minimally extended into English, as in (APOcalyptic)."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"A Perfect Circle is an American rock supergroup formed in 1999 by guitarist Billy Howerdel and Tool vocalist Maynard James Keenan. The original incarnation of the band also included Paz Lenchantin on bass, Troy Van Leeuwen on guitar, and Tim Alexander on drums, with Josh Freese as the primary drummer after the band's initial round of touring prior to their first album. The latest lineup features Puscifer and Ashes Divide bassist Matt McJunkins; former The Smashing Pumpkins guitarist James Iha; and Puscifer and Ashes Divide touring drummer, Jeff Friedl. Despite having a varied cast since inception, the stylistic content of the songs has remained consistent with Howerdel as composer, and Keenan penning the lyrics and melodies. A Perfect Circle has released three albums: their debut Mer de Noms in 2000, a follow up, Thirteenth Step in 2003, and an album of cover songs titled Emotive in 2004. Shortly after Emotive's release, the band went into hiatus while members focused on other projects, the most notably being Keenan's work with Tool and Puscifer, and Howerdel's putting out a solo album, Keep Telling Myself It's Alright, under the moniker Ashes Divide. In late 2008, Keenan and Howerdel announced the band would reform, though the band's activity would ultimately be sporadic in the coming years. The band toured in 2011 and 2013, and then released a live album, A Perfect Circle Live: Featuring Stone and Echo, and a greatest hits album, Three Sixty in late 2013. Work on new material has been alluded to by members since 2008, though progress has been slow due to Keenan's other commitments and uncertainty in the direction of the releases. The only new studio material released since the band's hiatus was the single \"By and Down\" in 2013."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Aerosmith is an American rock band, sometimes referred to as \"the Bad Boys from Boston\" and \"America's Greatest Rock and Roll Band\". Their style, which is rooted in blues-based hard rock, has come to also incorporate elements of pop, heavy metal, and rhythm and blues, and has inspired many subsequent rock artists. They were formed in Boston, Massachusetts in 1970. Guitarist Joe Perry and bassist Tom Hamilton, originally in a band together called the Jam Band, met up with vocalist/pianist/harmonicist Steven Tyler, drummer Joey Kramer, and guitarist Ray Tabano, and formed Aerosmith. In 1971, Tabano was replaced by Brad Whitford, and the band began developing a following in Boston. They were signed to Columbia Records in 1972, and released a string of gold and platinum albums, beginning with their 1973 eponymous debut album, followed by Get Your Wings in 1974. In 1975, the band broke into the mainstream with the album Toys in the Attic, and their 1976 follow-up Rocks cemented their status as hard rock superstars. Two additional albums followed in 1977 and 1979. Their first five albums have since attained multi-platinum status. Throughout the 1970s, the band toured extensively and charted a dozen Hot 100 singles. By the end of the decade, they were among the most popular hard rock bands in the world and developed a loyal following of fans, often referred to as the \"Blue Army\". However, drug addiction and internal conflict took their toll on the band, which led to the departures of Perry and Whitford in 1979 and 1981, respectively; they were replaced by Jimmy Crespo and Rick Dufay. The band did not fare well between 1980 and 1984, releasing the album Rock in a Hard Place, which was certified gold but failed to match their previous successes. Perry and Whitford returned to Aerosmith in 1984 and the band signed a new deal with Geffen Records. After a comeback tour, the band recorded Done with Mirrors (1985), which won some critical praise but failed to come close to commercial expectations. It was not until the band's collaboration with rap group Run\u2013D.M.C. in 1986, and the 1987 multi-platinum release Permanent Vacation, that they regained the level of popularity they had experienced in the 1970s. In the late 1980s and 1990s, the band scored several hits and won numerous awards for music from the multi-platinum albums Pump (1989), Get a Grip (1993), and Nine Lives (1997), and embarked on their most extensive concert tours to date. The band also became a pop culture phenomenon with popular music videos and notable appearances in television, film, and video games. Their comeback has been described as one of the most remarkable and spectacular in rock 'n' roll history. Additional albums followed in 2001, 2004, and 2012. Since 2001, the band has toured every year except 2008. After 47 years of performing, the band continues to tour and record music, but is contemplating a farewell tour slated to begin in 2017. Aerosmith is the best-selling American hard rock band of all time, having sold more than 150 million records worldwide, including over 70 million records in the United States alone. With 25 gold albums, 18 platinum albums, and 12 multi-platinum albums, they hold the record for the most total certifications by an American band and are tied for the most multi-platinum albums by an American band. The band has scored 21 Top 40 hits on the Billboard Hot 100, nine number-one Mainstream Rock hits, four Grammy Awards, six American Music Awards, and ten MTV Video Music Awards. They were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2001, and were included among both Rolling Stone's and VH1's lists of the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time. In 2013, the band's principal songwriters, Tyler and Perry, were inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Alabama is an American country, Southern rock and bluegrass band formed in Fort Payne, Alabama in 1969. The band was founded by Randy Owen (lead vocals, rhythm guitar) and his cousin Teddy Gentry (bass guitar, background vocals), soon joined by their other cousin, Jeff Cook (lead guitar, fiddle, keyboards). First operating under the name Wildcountry, the group toured the Southeast bar circuit in the early 1970s, and began writing original songs. They changed their name to Alabama in 1977 and following the chart success of two singles, were approached by RCA Records for a record deal. Alabama's biggest success came in the 1980s, where the band had over 27 number one hits, seven multi-platinum albums and received numerous awards. Alabama's first single on RCA Records, \"Tennessee River\", began a streak of number one singles, including \"Love in the First Degree\" (1981), \"Mountain Music\" (1982), \"Dixieland Delight\" (1983), \"If You're Gonna Play in Texas (You Gotta Have a Fiddle in the Band)\" (1984) and \"Song of the South\" (1987). The group's popularity waned slightly in the 1990s, although they continued to produce hit singles and multi-platinum record sales. Alabama disbanded in 2006 following a farewell tour and two albums of inspirational music, but reunited in 2010 and have continued to record and tour worldwide. The band's blend of traditional country music and Southern rock combined with elements of gospel, and pop music gave it a crossover appeal that helped lead to their success. They also toured extensively and incorporated production elements such as lighting and \"sets\" inspired by rock concerts into their shows. The band has over 30 number one country records on the Billboard charts to their credit and have sold over 75 million records, making them one of the world's best-selling bands of all time. AllMusic credited the band with popularizing the idea of a country band, and wrote that \"it's unlikely that any other country group will be able to surpass the success of Alabama.\""@en ;

The band is composed of vocalist Johan Hegg, guitarists Olavi Mikkonen and Johan S\u00F6derberg and bassist Ted Lundstr\u00F6m. Amon Amarth has released ten studio albums, one compilation album, one EP, one video album, and ten music videos. Its first studio album, Once Sent from the Golden Hall, debuted in 1998. Four more studio releases followed, before the band saw its breakthrough with the 2008 album Twilight of the Thunder God, which debuted at No. 11 on the Swedish album charts and No. 50 on the US Billboard 200. Three more albums, Surtur Rising, Deceiver of the Gods, and Jomsviking followed in 2011, 2013, and 2016, respectively."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Anal Cunt, also known as AxCx and A.C., was an American grindcore band that formed in Newton, Massachusetts in 1988. Since its inception, the band underwent a number of line-up changes. Known for its grindcore musical style and controversial lyrics, Anal Cunt released eight full-length studio albums in addition to a number of compilations and extended plays. On June 11, 2011, the band's frontman and founder Seth Putnam died of a suspected heart attack, ending the band. They have been categorized as grindcore, noisecore, noisegrind and hardcore. The band is often referred to by their initials A.C. (often written as AxCx) due to the offensive nature of their name and censorship limits on some radio and publications, and many of their album covers simply display the initials A.C. However, the band managed to subvert even this abbreviation by drawing these letters in a manner resembling an anus and a vulva. Their early material contained no pre-written lyrics or music. Rather, the band developed a style which consisted of extremely loud, fast, and aggressive noise that was created entirely on the spot. Over the years, the band eventually shifted their style and slowly began to incorporate more riffs and pre-written lyrics into their songs. It was not until then that the band earned the reputation for intentionally being outrageous and offensive. In 2011, they released a \"cock rock\" album entitled Fuckin' A. An album of material similar to their old grindcore albums called Wearing Out Our Welcome was released digitally in 2010."@en ;

The group's mostly instrumental compositions were novel melodic sound collages based on digital sampler technology, which was new at the time. Inspired by turn-of-the-20th-century revolutions in music, the Art of Noise were initially packaged as a faceless anti- or non-group, blurring the distinction between the art and its creators. The band is noted for innovative use of electronics and computers in pop music and particularly for innovative use of sampling. From the earliest releases on ZTT, the band referred to itself as both Art of Noise and The Art of Noise. Official and unofficial releases and press material use both versions."@en ;

Sugababes singer Heidi Range was included in the original line-up but was replaced by Hamilton. The group's debut album Right Now was released in October 2000 and peaked at number 39 in the UK. After four top ten singles, Katona quit the group and was replaced by former Precious singer Jenny Frost. \"Whole Again\" (recorded before Katona left), their next single, became their most successful single when it topped the UK singles chart and became the 13th best-selling single of the 2000s. The group re-released their debut album, with some tracks re-recorded with Frost's vocals. The album hit number one in the UK with the album going double platinum after selling over 600,000 copies in the UK. Between 2002 and 2004, the group released a further two studio albums, Feels So Good (which also went double platinum in the UK) and Ladies Night, and a greatest hits album before announcing a break following their 2004 tour. To date the group have had three UK number-one singles: \"Whole Again\", the fourth-best-selling song of all time by a girl group; \"Eternal Flame\", a song originally recorded by The Bangles; and \"The Tide Is High (Get the Feeling)\", a song originally recorded by The Paragons and by Blondie. The group split up in 2004 after selling over 10 million records worldwide. After making sporadic appearances in 2006 and 2008, it was announced that McClarnon, Hamilton, and Katona would reunite for the ITV2 series The Big Reunion, along with five other pop groups of their time\u2014B*Witched, Five, Liberty X, Honeyz and 911. Frost was unable to take part in the comeback because of her pregnancy, but Hamilton has since confirmed that Frost would be welcomed back if she wanted to rejoin the group in the future."@en ;

The quartet was one of the Soviet Union's best known in the West during the Cold War era, through concert performances in the United States and Europe and through distribution of their recordings. The quartet had a close relationship with composer Dmitri Shostakovich, who personally consulted them on each of his quartets. They also performed with the pianist Sviatoslav Richter on many occasions. They have recorded all of Shostakovich's string quartets as well as all of Beethoven's quartets. Their many recordings include works by a wide range of composers on the Melodiya, Teldec, Virgin Records, and Chandos Records labels. The original Borodin quartet's sound was characterised by an almost symphonic volume and a highly developed ability to phrase whilst maintaining group cohesion. Although it has seen many changes in personnel over its life span, all members of the quartet have been graduates of the Moscow Conservatory."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Buffalo Springfield was an American-Canadian rock band, formed in Los Angeles in 1966. Their original lineup included Stephen Stills (guitar, keyboards, vocals), Dewey Martin (drums, vocals), Bruce Palmer (electric bass), Richie Furay (guitar, vocals), and Neil Young (guitar, harmonica, piano, vocals). Pioneering the folk rock genre, Buffalo Springfield, along with the Byrds, combined elements of folk and country music with British invasion influences into their early works. Their second studio album, Buffalo Springfield Again, marked their progression to psychedelia and hard rock. With a name taken from a steamroller, the group signed to Atlantic Records in 1966 and released their debut single \u201CNowadays Clancy Can\u2019t Even Sing\" - a regional hit in Los Angeles. The following January, the group released the protest song they were most prominently known for, \"For What It's Worth\". After various drug-related arrests and line-up changes, the group decided to break up in 1968. Stephen Stills went on to form the folk rock supergroup Crosby, Stills & Nash with David Crosby of the Byrds and Graham Nash of the Hollies. Neil Young had launched his successful solo career and reunited with Stills in Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young in 1969. The group was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1997."@en ;

In August 1971, the band became Lips (a trio consisting of Criss and his Chelsea bandmates Michael Benvenga and Stan Penridge). By the spring of 1973, Lips was just the duo of Criss and Penridge and eventually disbanded completely. Their sound has been compared to the Moody Blues and Procol Harum.

Two songs from that album, \"Somebody to Love\" and \"White Rabbit\", are among Rolling Stone's \"500 Greatest Songs of All Time.\" The \"classic\" line-up of Jefferson Airplane remained stable from 1967 to early 1970, and consisted of Marty Balin, Jack Casady, Spencer Dryden, Paul Kantner, Jorma Kaukonen and Grace Slick.

Both Madness and UB40 spent 214 weeks on the UK singles charts over the course of the decade, holding the record for most weeks spent by a group in the 1980s UK singles charts.

	dbo:abstract	"Ministry is an American industrial metal band founded by lead singer and only original member Al Jourgensen in 1981. Originally a new wave synthpop outfit, Ministry changed its style to become one of the pioneers of industrial metal in the mid-1980s. Ministry found mainstream success in the early 1990s with their fifth studio album Psalm 69: The Way to Succeed and the Way to Suck Eggs (1992) and touring as part of the Lollapalooza festival. After 27 years of performing, Jourgensen decided to end the band in 2008, saying a reunion would never happen. However, in August 2011, a reunion was announced, when Ministry confirmed they would play one of their first shows in four years at the Wacken Open Air festival in August 2012. Ministry released a new album, Relapse, on March 23, 2012, which was followed by a world tour. Following the death of long time guitarist Mike Scaccia, Ministry released their most recent studio album From Beer to Eternity in September 2013, and subsequently began to tour again with new guitarist Cesar Soto."@en ;
