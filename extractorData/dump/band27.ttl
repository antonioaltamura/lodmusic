Kurt Dahlke was replaced by Chrislo Haas (electronic instruments, bass guitar, saxophone) in 1979. Since 1981, the band has consisted of Delgado-L\u00F3pez and G\u00F6rl. D.A.F.'s most famous songs are \"Kebab-Tr\u00E4ume\" and, from the album Alles ist gut, the grimly sarcastic \"Der Mussolini\", a pulsing dance song. The lyrics \"Dance the Mussolini, move your behind, clap your hands, and now the Adolf Hitler, and now the Jesus Christ, and now the Communism\", caused a scandal. In interviews they claimed to not target anything or anyone specific while creating lyrics to be taken as a parody of words and phrases floating around in the public media. \"Sato-Sato\" and \"Der Mussolini\" are both examples of songs written around Delgado-L\u00F3pez's fascination with the sound of a particular word. A few months before the 2003 invasion of Iraq D.A.F. released \"The Sheriff (An Anti-American Song)\". The album Alles ist gut (Everything is fine) received the German \"Schallplattenpreis\" award by the \"Deutsche Phono-Akademie\", an association of the German recording industry."@en ;

It sold over 6 million copies and became the most exported French album at the time. It was followed by Era 2 in 2000 and The Mass in 2003. In 2008 the project saw a significant departure from its previous themes and presented a more electronic soundscape with Arabic influences in its fourth album, Reborn. In the following two years, Era released Classics and Classics 2, which consisted in contemporary reinterpretations of classical works by Johann Sebastian Bach, Giuseppe Verdi, Antonio Vivaldi, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, Ludwig van Beethoven and Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky, amongst others. In 2013, Era released its latest work, an album in collaboration with French singer and actress Arielle Dombasle entitled Arielle Dombasle by Era.

The band was formed after Patrick desired to start his own band after leaving Nine Inch Nails as their touring guitarist. Their debut album, Short Bus, was released in 1995, and ended up going platinum, selling over one million copies, largely due to the success of the band's single \"Hey Man Nice Shot.\" After the album, the band would go through the first of many line-up changes, leaving Patrick as the only consistent member across all music releases. After Liesegang's departure in 1997, Patrick recorded a follow up album with the Short Bus  touring band members, who became full-time members thereafter. The resulting effort, Title of Record, also went platinum, off the success of the song \"Take a Picture\", in 1999. A third album, The Amalgamut, was released in 2002 with the same members, though sales stalled with Patrick checking into rehab after years of heavy alcohol and drug abuse just as touring for the album had began. The band went into hiatus while Patrick went to rehab, and then formed a new band, Army of Anyone, which released one self-titled album. After Army of Anyone went into hiatus, Patrick returned to Filter, releasing Anthems for the Damned in 2008, The Trouble with Angels in 2010, and The Sun Comes Out Tonight in 2013, with a revolving door of different musicians. A seventh studio album, Crazy Eyes, recorded with Patrick and another entirely new lineup, was released on April 8, 2016."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Gang of Four are an English post-punk group, formed in 1977 in Leeds. The original members were singer Jon King, guitarist Andy Gill, bass guitarist Dave Allen and drummer Hugo Burnham. There have been many different line-ups including, among other notable musicians, Sara Lee and Gail Ann Dorsey. After a brief lull in the 1980s, different constellations of the band recorded two studio albums in the 1990s. Between 2004 and 2006 the original line-up was reunited; as of 2013, Gill is the sole original member. The band plays a stripped-down mix of punk rock, funk and dub, with an emphasis on the social and political ills of society. Gang of Four are widely considered one of the leading bands of the late 1970s/early 1980s post-punk movement. Their early 80s albums (Songs of the Free and Hard) found them softening some of their more jarring qualities, and drifting towards dance-punk and disco. Their debut album, Entertainment!, was ranked as fifth greatest punk album of all time  and at Number 483 in Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time. The album was listed by Pitchfork Media as the 8th best album of the 1970s. David Fricke of Rolling Stone described Gang of Four as \"probably the best politically motivated band in rock & roll.\". Rolling Stone described the album: \"Fusing James Brown and early hip-hop with the bullet-point minimalism of the Ramones, Gang of Four were a genuine revolutionary force in their pursuit of working-class justice. The Leeds foursome bound their Marxist critique in tightly wound knots of enraged funk and avenging-disco syncopation\"."@en ;

They released only one album, 1979's (GI), produced by Joan Jett, and were featured the following year in Penelope Spheeris' documentary film The Decline of Western Civilization, which chronicled the Los Angeles punk movement. The Germs disbanded following Crash's suicide on December 7, 1980. Their music was influential to many later punk rock acts. Smear went on to achieve greater fame performing with Nirvana and Foo Fighters. In 2005, actor Shane West was cast to play Crash in the biographical film What We Do Is Secret, named after a song by the Germs. He performed with Smear, Doom and Bolles at a production party for the film, after which the Germs reformed with West as singer. The new lineup of the band toured the United States several times, including performances on the 2006 and 2008 Warped Tours."@en ;

Although group members were born in France, their parents were mostly gitanos, berber-moroccan and spanish gypsies who fled Catalonia during the 1930s Spanish Civil War. They are known for bringing Catalan rumba, a pop-oriented music distantly derived from traditional flamenco music, to worldwide audiences. The group originally called itself Los Reyes. Their music has a particular rumba flamenca style, with pop influences; many songs of the Gipsy Kings fit social dances, such as salsa and rumba. Their music has been described as a place where \"Spanish flamenco and gypsy rhapsody meet salsa funk\"."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Kent is a Swedish rock band that formed in Eskilstuna, Sweden in 1990. With members Joakim Berg, Martin Sk\u00F6ld, Sami Sirvi\u00F6 and Markus Mustonen, the band has had numerous radio hits throughout Sweden and Scandinavia and consecutive number one studio albums on the Sweden top list (Sverigetopplistan) beginning with the release of Verkligen (1996) and led by the single \"Kr\u00E4m (s\u00E5 n\u00E4ra f\u00E5r ingen g\u00E5)\". With origins rooted in distorted rock, they found mainstream success through their alternative rock albums of the mid-1990s, 2000s and 2010s, the latter decades during which they adopted elements of synthpop. With five number-one singles, 21 Swedish Grammy Awards, ten number-one albums, and over 3 million record sales, Kent is considered the most popular rock/pop group within Sweden and throughout Scandinavia. Vapen & ammunition (2002) topped the Swedish charts for 95 weeks. Kent is often compared to bands like U2, Coldplay and Depeche Mode. Because Kent's songs are primarily performed in Swedish, they are unfamiliar to most English-speaking audiences. Kent briefly attempted an international career with English versions of the albums Isola (1997) and Hagnesta Hill (1999) and an accompanying American tour for the former, but stopped after finding less success than they had in Scandinavia. Joakim Berg, the lead singer and lyricist, says \"there are two kinds of lyrics I write. One kind is based in places and the other is based in feelings. You move between those two whether you want to or not.\" \"VinterNoll2\" is an unlockable track in Career Mode on Guitar Hero World Tour. They have their own SingStar called SingStar Kent released on PlayStation 2 and 3. The band announced on March 16, 2016 that they would release their final album, titled D\u00E5 som nu f\u00F6r alltid, after 26 years of performing. The album was released on May 20, 2016. The band's announcement noted that the dissolution of the band is voluntary and is despite their continued success."@en ;

Composed of 14 members, the band was founded in the late 1990s. Leningrad soon became notorious for vulgar lyrics (including lots of Russian mat) and celebration of alcoholism, which were also the main reasons most radio stations initially avoided the band. This did not stop Leningrad's growing popularity, partly because of the rich brass sound. The band eventually made its way to radio and TV (with censored words bleeped out), with Shnurov even presenting some New Year's Eve TV shows. In 2007 the group began experimenting with female backup vocals, finally choosing jazz singer Yuliya Kogan as a permanent band member. Disbanded in 2008, Leningrad reunited in 2010. Several new songs and videos have been released since, most of them featuring lead vocals by Kogan rather than Shnur."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Maroon 5 is an American pop rock band that originated in Los Angeles, California. It currently consists of lead vocalist Adam Levine, lead guitarist James Valentine, keyboardist and rhythm guitarist Jesse Carmichael, bassist Mickey Madden, drummer Matt Flynn and keyboardist PJ Morton. Before the current group was established, the original four members, Adam Levine (lead vocals, lead guitar), Jesse Carmichael (rhythm guitar, backing vocals), Mickey Madden (bass guitar) and Ryan Dusick (drums), formed a band known as Kara's Flowers in 1994, while they were still in high school. The band, which self-released an album called We Like Digging?, then signed to Reprise Records and released the album The Fourth World in 1997. After the album garnered a tepid response, the band parted ways with the record label and the members attended college. In 2001, the band changed its image by adding guitarist James Valentine and pursuing a new direction under the name Maroon 5. At this point, Carmichael switched to playing keyboards, which has since become his main instrument in the band. After these changes, Maroon 5 signed with a subsidiary of J Records, Octone Records, and released their debut album, Songs About Jane, in June 2002. The album's lead single, \"Harder to Breathe\", received heavy airplay, which helped the album to debut at number six on the Billboard 200 chart. In 2004, the album went platinum and has been dubbed \"the sleeper hit of the millennium\". The band won the Grammy Award for Best New Artist in 2005. For the next few years, Maroon 5 toured extensively worldwide in support of Songs About Jane and produced two live recordings: 2004's 1.22.03.Acoustic and 2005's Live \u2013 Friday the 13th. In 2006, Dusick officially left Maroon 5 after suffering from serious wrist and shoulder injuries and was replaced by Matt Flynn. The band then recorded their second album, It Won't Be Soon Before Long and released it in May 2007. The album reached number one on the US Billboard 200 chart and the lead single, \"Makes Me Wonder\", became the band's first number-one single on the Billboard Hot 100. In September 2010, Maroon 5 released their third studio album Hands All Over, which was re-released in 2011 to include the single \"Moves like Jagger\" featuring Christina Aguilera. While the original version of the album received mixed reviews, \"Moves like Jagger\" reached the number one position on the Billboard Hot 100. The band released their fourth album, Overexposed, on June 26, 2012. All four singles of the album were highly successful on the Billboard Hot 100, including second single \"One More Night\", which reached number one for 9 weeks straight. Keyboardist PJ Morton became an official member of the band in 2012, after gaining little success with his previous albums as an R&B vocalist. The addition of PJ Morton meant that for the first time, Maroon 5 had six official members. The same year, the bass player of Phantom Planet, Sam Farrar, became an official touring member, playing many different instruments (including guitars, percussion and additional keyboards), singing backing vocals and also providing samples and other special effects. In 2014, the band signed with Interscope Records and released their fifth studio album, V. Maroon 5 has sold more than 20 million albums and 70 million singles worldwide."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Ministry is an American industrial metal band founded by lead singer and only original member Al Jourgensen in 1981. Originally a new wave synthpop outfit, Ministry changed its style to become one of the pioneers of industrial metal in the mid-1980s. Ministry found mainstream success in the early 1990s with their fifth studio album Psalm 69: The Way to Succeed and the Way to Suck Eggs (1992) and touring as part of the Lollapalooza festival. After 27 years of performing, Jourgensen decided to end the band in 2008, saying a reunion would never happen. However, in August 2011, a reunion was announced, when Ministry confirmed they would play one of their first shows in four years at the Wacken Open Air festival in August 2012. Ministry released a new album, Relapse, on March 23, 2012, which was followed by a world tour. Following the death of long time guitarist Mike Scaccia, Ministry released their most recent studio album From Beer to Eternity in September 2013, and subsequently began to tour again with new guitarist Cesar Soto."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Misfits are an American horror punk band often recognized as the progenitors of the horror punk subgenre, blending punk rock and other musical influences with horror film themes and imagery. Founded in 1977 in Lodi, New Jersey the original lineup consisted of singer and songwriter Glenn Danzig, bassist Jerry Only, and drummer Manny Mart\u00EDnez. Danzig and Only were the only consistent members throughout the next six years. During this time they released several EPs and singles, and with Only's brother Doyle as guitarist, the albums Walk Among Us (1982) and Earth A.D./Wolfs Blood (1983), both considered touchstones of the early-1980s hardcore punk movement. Misfits disbanded in 1983 and Danzig went on to form Samhain and then the eponymous Danzig. Several albums of reissued and previously unreleased material were issued after the group's dissolution, and their music became influential to punk rock, heavy metal, and alternative rock music of the late 1990s and early 2000s. After a series of legal battles with Danzig, Only and Doyle regained the rights to record and perform as the Misfits. They formed a new version of the band in 1995 with singer Michale Graves and drummer Dr. Chud. This incarnation of Misfits had a sound much more rooted in heavy metal, and released the albums American Psycho (1997) and Famous Monsters (1999) before dissolving in 2000. Jerry Only then took over lead vocals and recruited former Black Flag guitarist Dez Cadena and former Ramones drummer Marky Ramone for a Misfits 25th Anniversary tour. This lineup released an album of cover songs entitled Project 1950 and toured for several years. In 2005 Ramone was replaced by Robo, who had played with Black Flag in the early 1980s and had also previously been Misfits' drummer from 1982 to 1983. This lineup released a single titled \"Land of the Dead\" in 2009. The Misfits' lineup of Only, Cadena, and drummer Eric \"Chupacabra\" Arce released a new album titled The Devil's Rain in October 2011. In 2015 it was announced that Cadena would be taking a break from music after receiving a cancer diagnosis, and was replaced by Only's son Jerry Caiafa II. That same year Soulfly's Marc Rizzo joined the band, also playing guitar, filling in for Cadena before Caiafa would move on to become the sole guitarist for the band. In September 2016, for the first time in 33 years, Danzig, Only and Doyle reunited for two headlining shows at the Riot Fest, along with original Slayer drummer Dave Lombardo and second guitarist Acey Slade."@en ;

The band's line-up consisted of vocalist and guitarist Justin Pierre, lead guitarist Joshua Cain, keyboardist Jesse Johnson, bassist Matthew Taylor, and drummer Tony Thaxton. Over the course of their nearly twenty-year career, the group toured heavily and released six studio albums, the majority on independent label Epitaph Records. The band's sound, at times described as pop punk or emo, made notable use of the Moog synthesizer. The group was formed in 1997 by Cain and Pierre, but it was not until 2002 that the group had formed a stable lineup, at which point they began recording music. The band signed to Epitaph in 2003, which released the band's debut album, I Am the Movie. Their breakthrough album, Commit This to Memory, arrived in 2005, and their third record, Even If It Kills Me (2007), also achieved commercial success. The band briefly signed to major label Columbia for their fourth record, My Dinosaur Life (2010), and rejoined Epitaph for Go in 2012, after which Thaxton left the group and was replaced by Claudio Rivera. Their final album Panic Stations was released in 2015. In 2016, the band announced their split and the So Long, Farewell tour, for which Thaxton rejoined the band."@en ;

The range of the improvisation is such that instruments are not tuned to each other, tempos and time signatures are not imposed, and the members push the ranges of their instrumentation by engaging in constant innovation."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"OSI is an American progressive rock band, originally formed by Fates Warning guitarist Jim Matheos in 2002. Chroma Key keyboardist and vocalist Kevin Moore is the only other full-time member of the band. The collaboration may be considered a studio project, as its members and contributors write and track most of their material independently, sharing and developing tracks long-distance, only coming together at the end of the process for mixing and additional tracking. The band's name is a reference to the Office of Strategic Influence, a short-lived American government agency formed in 2001 to support the War on Terror through propaganda. The band has featured a number of guest musicians on its albums, including Sean Malone, Steven Wilson, Mikael \u00C5kerfeldt, Joey Vera and Gavin Harrison. Matheos recruited Moore, Dream Theater's then-drummer Mike Portnoy and Sean Malone (Fretless Bass and Chapman Stickist) to perform on what was originally planned to be a Matheos solo album. Matheos and Portnoy originally planned to produce a progressive metal album similar to Matheos' work in Fates Warning, however Moore's impact changed the music's direction and genre, incorporating electronica into the original progressive metal sound. The band's debut album was released by InsideOut Music in 2003. OSI was originally intended to be a one-off project, but Matheos and Moore found they both had gaps in their schedules so produced a follow-up. Free was released in 2006, with Portnoy returning to play drums as a session musician rather than a full band member, due to personal and musical differences between him and Moore. Blood was released in 2009, with Porcupine Tree drummer Gavin Harrison replacing Portnoy. The fourth album Fire Make Thunder was released in 2012 by Metal Blade Records, with Harrison once again on drums."@en ;

With later albums the music became more melodic and punk-influenced, and the band eventually gained attention with their 1998 release www.pitchshifter.com for its fusion of electronic music like drum 'n bass with metal and rock, which has been compared with other electronic groups like The Prodigy. Albeit the band has found little mainstream success, the band managed to gain a platinum with the release of the Mortal Kombat: Annihilation soundtrack and their 2000 release Deviant peaking at 39 in Billboard 200. Since its formation, the band has released six studio albums, three EPs and eight music videos. The band has played in various festivals around the world including Ozzfest, Phoenix Festival and Damnation Festival."@en ;

The duo then began performing at local events, eventually singing background for R&B superstar, Tyrese. Through Tyrese, they met production duo Damon Thomas and Harvey Mason Jr. of The Underdogs for Underdog Entertainment, and were introduced to Clive Davis who subsequently signed them to the J Records imprint in 2004.

	dbo:abstract	"10cc are an English rock band founded in Stockport who achieved their greatest commercial success in the 1970s. The band initially consisted of four musicians \u2013 Graham Gouldman, Eric Stewart, Kevin Godley, and Lol Creme \u2013 who had written and recorded together for some three years, before assuming the name \"10cc\" in 1972. 10cc featured two songwriting teams, one \"commercial\" and one \"artistic\". Stewart and Gouldman were predominantly pop-songwriters, who created most of the band's accessible songs. By way of contrast, Godley and Creme were the predominantly experimental half of 10cc, featuring an Art School sensibility and cinematic inspired writing. Every member of 10cc was a multi-instrumentalist, singer, writer and producer, and the writing teams frequently switched partners, so that Godley/Gouldman or Creme/Stewart compositions were not uncommon. After Godley and Creme left the band in 1976, Gouldman and Stewart were the main creative forces behind 10cc. Stewart left the band in 1996, and Gouldman continues to lead a touring version of 10cc. Most of the band's albums were recorded at their own Strawberry Studios (North) in Stockport and Strawberry Studios (South) in Dorking, with most of those engineered by Stewart. 10cc was co-managed by Ric Dixon and Harvey Lisberg at Kennedy Street, who had represented the individual members of the band since the mid-1960s."@en ;

The band was formed in 1988 by vocalist and guitarist Nick Hexum, lead guitarist Jim Watson (who would later be replaced by Tim Mahoney), bassist Aaron \"P-Nut\" Wills. and drummer Chad Sexton. In 1992, Doug \"SA\" Martinez joined to sing and provide turntables for 311's later albums, rounding out the current line-up. The band's name originates from the police code for indecent exposure in Omaha, Nebraska, after the original guitarist for the band was arrested for streaking. To date, 311 has released eleven studio albums, two live albums, four compilation albums, four EPs and four DVDs. After a series of independent releases, 311 was signed to Capricorn Records in 1992 and released the albums Music (1993) and Grassroots (1994) to moderate success. They achieved greater success with their 1995 triple platinum self-titled album, which reached number 12 on the Billboard 200 on the strength of the singles \"Down\" and \"All Mixed Up\", the former of which topped the Billboard Hot Modern Rock Tracks in 1996. The band's next three albums \u2014 Transistor (1997), Soundsystem (1999) and From Chaos (2001) \u2014 were also successful, with the first going platinum and the last two going gold. Their 2004 compilation album Greatest Hits '93\u2013'03 was also certified gold. The band's most recent studio album is 2014's Stereolithic. As of 2011, 311 has sold over 8.5 million records in the United States."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"3 Doors Down is an American rock band from Escatawpa, Mississippi that formed in 1996. The band originally consisted of Brad Arnold (lead vocals/drums), Todd Harrell (bass) and Matt Roberts (lead guitar, backing vocals). They were soon joined by rhythm guitarist Chris Henderson, and later by drummer Richard Liles, who played for the band during their tour supporting their first album. Daniel Adair played drums on tour from 2002\u20132005. This configuration played nearly 1,000 shows across the world following the release of their hugely successful Away from the Sun album. In 2005, when Adair was hired full-time by Nickelback, Greg Upchurch (Puddle of Mudd) joined to play drums full-time. In 2012, original guitarist Matt Roberts departed due to health issues. Chet Roberts, who was formerly Chris Henderson's guitar tech, became Roberts' successor. In 2013, Harrell was fired from the band after being charged with vehicular homicide. Bassist Justin Biltonen replaced him. The band rose to international fame with their first single, \"Kryptonite\", which charted in the top three on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. The band then signed onto Republic Records and released their debut album, The Better Life, in 2000. The album was the 11th-best-selling album of the year and was certified 6x platinum in the United States. Their second album, Away from the Sun, (2002) continued the band's success; it debuted at No. 8 on the Billboard 200 chart, went multi-platinum in the United States like its predecessor, and spawned the hits \"When I'm Gone\" and \"Here Without You\". The band followed it up by extensive touring for two years before releasing their third album, Seventeen Days, in 2005. The album debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 chart and was certified platinum within its first month of release. Their fourth, self-titled album, 3 Doors Down (2008), also debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 chart. The band's fifth studio album, Time of My Life (2011) debuted at No. 3 at the charts. The band has shared the stage with artists such as Daughtry, Pop Evil, Red Sun Rising, Black Stone Cherry, Megadeth, Staind, Nickelback, Three Days Grace, Oleander_(band), Alter Bridge, Breaking Benjamin, Seether, Shinedown, Hinder, Mentors, ZZ Top, and Lynyrd Skynyrd.

	dbo:abstract	"A Tribe Called Quest is an American hip-hop trio that was formed in 1985, and was composed of MC and producer Q-Tip, MC Phife Dawg and DJ and producer Ali Shaheed Muhammad. A fourth member, rapper Jarobi White, left the group after their first album in 1991. He continued to contribute to the band sporadically before rejoining for their 2006 reunion. Along with De La Soul, the group was a central part of the Native Tongues Posse, and enjoyed the most commercial success out of all the groups to emerge from that collective. Many of their songs, such as \"Bonita Applebum\", \"Can I Kick It?\", \"I Left My Wallet in El Segundo\", \"Scenario\", \"Check the Rhime\", \"Jazz (We've Got)\", \"Award Tour\" and \"Electric Relaxation\" are regarded as classics. The group released five albums between 1990 and 1998 and disbanded in 1998. In 2006, the group reunited and toured the United States. The group is regarded as a pioneer of alternative hip-hop music, having helped to pave the way for many innovative artists. John Bush of AllMusic called them \"the most intelligent, artistic rap group during the 1990s,\" while the editors of About.com ranked them number four on their list of the \"25 Best Rap Groups of All Time.\" In 2005, A Tribe Called Quest received a Special Achievement Award at the Billboard R&B Hip-Hop Awards in Atlanta. In 2007, the group was formally honored at the 4th VH1 Hip-Hop Honors."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Avantasia is a German supergroup rock opera project created by Tobias Sammet, vocalist of the band Edguy. It has been characterized as a rock opera, as it features the contributions of various vocalists and musicians and it consists of concept albums.

The project can be divided into three periods of activity. The first, 1999\u20132002, saw the release of a self-titled single and the full-length albums The Metal Opera and The Metal Opera Part II. The second, 2006\u20132011, consists of the EPs Lost in Space Part I & II and The Wicked Trilogy, composed of the albums The Scarecrow, The Wicked Symphony and Angel of Babylon. The third period, 2013\u20132016, begins with the album The Mystery of Time and ends with the Ghostlights release.
