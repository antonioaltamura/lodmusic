Returning to Britain in 1962, he sold records from the back of his car to the Jamaican community.

Folk performers whom he befriended include Bob Dylan, Tom Paxton, Patrick Sky, Phil Ochs, Ramblin' Jack Elliott, and Joni Mitchell. Bob Dylan recorded Van Ronk's arrangement of the traditional song \"House of the Rising Sun\" on his first album, which The Animals turned into a chart-topping rock single in 1964, helping inaugurate the folk-rock movement.

Pete attended Chaminade College Preparatory Middle School, but was expelled in the middle of his 8th grade year. He then attended Taft High School, where he met the rest of Bad Religion. Pete recorded some of the tracks on Bad Religion's 1982 debut How Could Hell Be Any Worse?. After the release of that album, he departed, then returned two years later to record the EP Back to the Known (1985). When Bad Religion brought the How Could Hell Be Any Worse? line-up back together in 1986, Pete recorded the band's first three reunion albums, Suffer (1988), No Control (1989) and Against the Grain (1990), which are widely considered to be among Bad Religion's most important works. Pete left Bad Religion again in the spring of 1991, due to his role in drumming for The Fishermen and to raise his family. It seems to have been an amicable departure, as he was thanked in the booklet of the Generator album, which would be Bad Religion's first release with Pete's replacement Bobby Schayer. In a 2003 show in Las Vegas, Finestone reunited with Bad Religion to play the drums for \"Fuck Armageddon...This Is Hell\" with the band live on stage. Pete is from the San Fernando Valley town of Northridge, roughly 20 miles north of Los Angeles, where Bad Religion is centered, and makes a living building workout machines at a local business. He was a former music student of original Circle Jerks drummer Lucky Lehrer and is featured in Bad Religion's 1989 European tour documentary Along the Way. Pete is still drumming today and is rumoured to be playing in several bands including Black On Sunshine and Jackass as well as doing studio work and film scoring. There's even a Peter Finestone tribute page in honour of his drumming talents. Pete also composed music for the recent film score, The Still Life released in 2006 with Dave \"The Snake\" Sabo, Skid Row; Adrian Young, No Doubt; Dizzy Reed, Guns N' Roses; Darius Rucker, Hootie and the Blowfish; Delaney Bramlett, Bonnie and Delaney and Friends; Eddie Hedges, Blessid Union of Souls; Dean Dinning, Toad the Wet Sprocket; Louise Post, Veruca Salt and Sonny Mone, Crazy Horse."@en ;

Fabo is currently signed to Atlantic Records, and has gone solo. Fader called Fabo \"an unquestioned living legend for certain segments of the rap community\" and said that \"Young Thug even paid tribute in his breakout 'Stoner.'\" D4L's breakout song Laffy Taffy dethroned Mariah Carey's \"Don't Forget About Us\" to claim the No. 1 spot on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. \"Laffy Taffy\" made Nielsen SoundScan history with digital download sales of over 175,000 copies, marking a new one-week high for sales of a single track. This achievement smashes the previous record set by Kanye West's \"Gold Digger,\" more than doubling the latter's one-week sales figure of 80,500. D4L earned recognition by the RIAA for highest certified master ringtone honors, going 3x multi-platinum for their song, Laffy Taffy. In November 2013, Complex (magazine) named D4L with the likes of industry greats Eminem, Lil Wayne, and Timbaland as one of The 10 Major Influences on Today's Rap Sound. The magazine credits D4L for influence on current California production style as well as the obvious \"ringtone\" rap, pop rap and dance-style rap music. Complex goes on to say, \"And no doubt group member, Fabo, a true star, was influential, particularly in the South.\" After a brief hiatus from the music scene, Fabo, who now goes by the stage name 2$ Fabo, returned in 2013 with a new single called \"Catch Me on That Molly,\" which was produced by King Dominus. In 2014, 2$ Fabo released the well-received We Amongst U, which Stereogum called their mixtape of the week and \"a hell of a good time.\" Additionally, Fader called \"We Amongst U\" the \"most fun mixtape of 2014.\" It goes on to describe the song \"Krazy Bout That Money,\" as being \"nothing short of ecstatic, a twinkling, Nard & B-reminiscent production over which Fabo delivers the most impassioned love letter to cash I've ever heard. It feels like hearing \"The World's Greatest\" for the first time."@en ;

Forrest has performed many times with the Red Hot Chili Peppers dating back to the mid-1980s and most recently in 2009 at an awards event honoring Kiedis for his commitment to helping other addicts with the addiction and recovery process. Forrest was also one of the last people to see actor River Phoenix alive the night he died of a drug overdose. In 2008, he began releasing a series of live digital EPs exclusively at his official website. In 2010, Forrest began hosting a weekly radio show, All Up In The Interweb, airing Wednesday nights on Indie1031.com. Forrest is the subject of Bob and the Monster, a documentary about his music career and battles with drug addiction. The documentary was released in March 2011 and continues to play on the film festival circuit. The DVD was released in September 2013. Forrest released a new album, Survival Songs, on October 9, 2015. It is a folk album featuring new material and folk versions of existing Thelonious Monster and Bicycle Thief songs."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Federico Aubele (born 1974) is an Argentine singer-songwriter whose music blends a variety of genres and styles: singer-songwriter, electronic and dub music. Born and raised in Buenos Aires, he started playing music at 12. He moved to Berlin in 2002 (during the Argentine crisis), where he lived for several years. After submitting a demo via email to Thievery Corporation's Eighteenth Street Lounge Music, he was signed quickly to the label, and released his debut album Gran Hotel Buenos Aires, produced by Thievery Corporation, in 2004. In 2006, he played at the Austin City Limits Music Festival. His song \"Esta Noche\" was featured in the 5th season of Alias (TV series) (episode 8) and \"La Esquina\" was featured in the 2007 movie The Take, starring John Leguizano. After Berlin, he moved to Barcelona where he began working on his new album, Panamericana (a title to indicate the many musical influences and in part named after the Pan-American Highway), which was released on September 18, 2007, also produced by Thievery Corporation. In 2009 he released Amatoria, a much more mellow album which featured a duet with Sabina Sciubba from Brazilian Girls and a collaboration with Miho Hatori. In late 2010 Federico finished the self produced Album Berlin 13, which was released in March 2011, and had a much stronger electronic music influence. He now lives in Brooklyn, NY."@en .

His experience within the Swedish metal scene goes back 17 years, and has included many of its luminaries; Liers in Wait, with Kristian W\u00E5hlin; Luciferion, an early band of Dark Tranquillity's Michael Nicklasson; and Crystal Age, consisting of Oscar Dronjak (HammerFall, ex-Ceremonial Oath) and Fredrik Larsson (ex-HammerFall). Dimension Zero features former In Flames guitarist Jesper Str\u00F6mblad, also formerly of Ceremonial Oath and HammerFall. Nilsson's style generally sways within the \"blastbeat/double bass\" tempo that is typical of death metal. However, one exception can be seen in Diabolique, which takes strong influence from gothic metal. Nilsson started as a guitarist in his early days but switched to play the drums. He still plays guitar and wrote one of the songs on Dimension Zero's debut album Silent Night Fever. He also wrote a lot of the music in the band Crystal Age."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Harald N\u00E6vdal (born 6 July 1970) known by his stage names Demonaz Doom Occulta and Demonaz, is a Norwegian musician best known as the founding guitarist and chief lyricist for the black metal band Immortal. In Immortal, he is known for his lyrics which, unconventionally for black metal, focus on icy landscapes and a fictional land called Blashyrkh. The story of Blashyrkh is gradually told throughout Immortal's albums. When writing lyrics he often takes long walks in the Norwegian countryside near his hometown of Bergen for inspiration. He was known for his simplistic but extremely fast guitar parts which always featured power chords. He and frontman Abbath comprised the core of Immortal in its early years, with other members fluctuating and little stability until drummer Horgh joined the band in 1997. Demonaz played guitar on the albums Diabolical Fullmoon Mysticism, Pure Holocaust and Battles in the North, with his last musical contribution to Immortal being the 1997 album Blizzard Beasts. That same year, he was diagnosed with acute tendinopathy and could no longer play guitar at the speed required for Immortal. Instead, he continues to write lyrics for the band and often takes the role of manager. He often accompanies the band on tour and is still seen by Abbath, Horgh and Apollyon as a member of the band even though it is unlikely he will ever be able to play guitar as part of the band. Demonaz has appeared in all of Immortal's music videos, including the music video for All Shall Fall, which was released in September 2010. Demonaz has started a band called Demonaz where he is the vocalist. The band also includes most of the members of the band I. He wrote the lyrics for the I album Between Two Worlds. He has released his debut album, March of the Norse, in April/May 2011. On 31 May 2016, according to Immortal's official Facebook page, Demonaz was officially annnouned as the band's new lead singer following the departure of Abbath in 2015."@en ;

He represented Israel in the Eurovision Song Contest 2010 with the song \"Milim\" (\"\u05DE\u05D9\u05DC\u05D9\u05DD\", \"Words\"). Skaat has been singing and performing in public since he was a child. At the age of six, he won a children's song festival competition. While still in elementary school he appeared on national television and as a teenager, he was the lead singer for both his city's and high school's bands. During his mandatory duty with the Israeli Defense Forces, he sang in the Communication Corps Band. Skaat's professional breakthrough came when he was a contestant on the second season of Kochav Nolad (\"\u05DB\u05D5\u05DB\u05D1 \u05E0\u05D5\u05DC\u05D3\", \"A Star is Born\"), a reality competition television show similar in format to American Idol, and finished in second place. After the show ended, he signed a recording contract with Hed Arzi, one of the largest music companies in Israel. His debut album, the self-titled Harel Skaat, was released in July 2006. It produced five hit singles, including the romantic ballad, \"Ve'at\" (\"\u05D5\u05D0\u05EA\", \"And You\"), which was the number one song of the year on both of the major Israeli year-end Hebrew song charts. The album has been certified platinum in Israel. He followed up the album with a concert tour, which surpassed 200 concert shows, a milestone in Israeli music. In early 2008, Skaat and Hed Arzi became embroiled in a year-long legal dispute. Shortly after the dispute was resolved, he entered into a new agreement with Aroma Music and Partner Communications and recorded his second album entitled Dmuyot (\u05D3\u05DE\u05D5\u05D9\u05D5\u05EA, Figures). The album was released in September 2009 and has been certified gold in Israel. Generally classified in the media as a pop singer, Skaat has been influenced by a wide variety of music, and his albums have featured an eclectic mix of songs, from rock to romantic ballads. His singing and performing talents have been widely praised by critics and Israeli music industry professionals, but his albums have received only mixed reviews. All of the songs on his official albums and EP have been sung in Hebrew, but Skaat has occasionally sung in English and in French in live concerts; he is currently working on a new album, which will be recorded in English. In December 2009, the Israel Broadcasting Authority selected Skaat internally to be Israel\u2019s representative for the Eurovision Song Contest 2010. The contest was held in Oslo, Norway, in late May 2010 and Israel placed 14th out of 39 entries."@en .

Duff began her acting career at a young age, and quickly became labeled a teen idol as the title character of the Disney Channel comedy series Lizzie McGuire (2001\u20132004). The series proved to be a hit, leading to a film adaptation of the series to be released. Duff began working on numerous projects with the Disney Channel, including the film Cadet Kelly (2002). She later began work on an album, releasing the Christmas themed Santa Claus Lane (2002) through Walt Disney Records. Upon signing with Hollywood Records, Duff began working on her second studio album, Metamorphosis (2003). The album achieved critical and commercial success, topping the Billboard 200 and selling over three million copies in the United States alone. The album also found success in both Canada and Japan. Duff's success in both acting and music led to her becoming a household name, with merchandise such as dolls, clothing, and fragrances being released. Duff began to expand her career into theatrical films, with leading roles in projects such as Agent Cody Banks (2003), Cheaper by the Dozen (2003), A Cinderella Story (2004), and Cheaper by the Dozen 2 (2005). She continued to have success in music, with her albums Hilary Duff (2004) and Most Wanted (2005) achieving Platinum status in the United States.

His songs are being featured in a series of tribute albums, starting with St. Jeffrey's Day: The Songs of Jeffrey Frederick, Volume I (2008).

Rowles was born in Whakatane, New Zealand, and is part M\u0101ori. His father, Eddie Hohapata Rowles, played for the 1938 M\u0101ori All Blacks. His mother was P\u0101keh\u0101. He was brought up in Kawerau, in the North Island of New Zealand. Rowles' birth name was simply John Rowles; he added the middle name \"Edward\" after his brother of that name died at a young age. Rowles is best known in New Zealand and Australia, though he has also performed in the United States, particularly Las Vegas, Nevada and Hawaii, where he was managed by Kimo Wilder McVay. In the United Kingdom he was best known for the hit, \"If I Only Had Time\", which reached number 3 in the UK Singles Chart in spring 1968, and stayed in the chart for eighteen weeks. This was a cover version of the French song \"Je n'aurai pas le temps\" with which the French singer Michel Fugain had a hit in 1967. The song also charted big in the Netherlands, reaching #2, after which the Franck Pourcel had a minor hit with an instrumental version of the song, bearing the original French song title. Rowles had another Top 20 hit in the UK with \"Hush . . . Not a Word to Mary\", also in 1968. This song also charted in the Netherlands. In the USA \"Cheryl Moana Marie\" got noticed in the summer of 1970 by some West Coast radio stations, but it lasted until the end of 1970 for the song to chart nationally, peaking at #64 in the Billboard Hot 100 and #78 in the Cash Box Top 100 resp. in early 1971."@en .

He is recognized as a major cultural icon in Taiwan, Hong Kong, and China. Stylistically, Lo defies classification, though his contribution to Taiwanese campus folk song (\u6821\u5712\u6C11\u6B4C) genre was most significant. His early music in particular shows strong folk roots, and many of his songs tap into native Taiwanese cultural influences. Some songs are reminiscent of 1950s American diner and soda shop rock, and others exhibit a 1970s lounge lizard growl. What captured the hearts of a generation, however, were his lyrics, touching on issues of life, attitudes, social responsibility, and the political problems of both Chinese Mainland and Taiwan with an underhandedly critical strain of dark humor. The lyrical style is not particularly artsy or complex, but rather conversational; the cleverness comes in the meaning, not how the words are put together."@en .

In Vienna he performed in a nightclub as a solo jazz pianist, joined later by saxophonist Wolfgang Puschnig. The duo formed the core of an ensemble that in 1977 became the Vienna Art Orchestra. R\u00FCegg's distinctive, often humorous compositions have drawn on a range of influences from traditional folk music to classics. He has also led the VAO to explore the big band repertory of American jazz composers such as Duke Ellington. Besides the traditional big-band complement, his orchestrations have prominently featured such instruments as the tuba, piccolo, bass clarinet, alphorn, exotic percussion, and wordless vocals. R\u00FCegg has composed hundreds of pieces for the Vienna Art Orchestra, other European big bands, and classical orchestras, as well as theatre music and film music. Since 1994 he has composed several works for soloist and chamber orchestra. Besides managing the VAO, R\u00FCegg has conducted workshops in Europe, worked as artistic director for music festivals, and headed multimedia and music-related projects. From 1983 to 1987 he directed the Vienna Art Choir. In 1991 he produced the film Mozart's Balls, commissioned by the BBC for the 1991 Mozart Year. R\u00FCegg founded the Porgy & Bess music club in Vienna and the Hans Koller Prize for Austrian jazz. In 2011 in New York he composed the music for the new show of the Big Apple Circus. In 2013 he arranged for and played piano for singer Lia Pale from Wels, Upper Austria."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Brett W. Gurewitz (born May 12, 1962), nicknamed Mr. Brett, is the guitarist and a songwriter of Bad Religion. He is also the owner of the music label Epitaph Records (which has handled many Bad Religion releases) and sister-labels ANTI-, Burning Heart Records, Fat Possum Records, and Hellcat Records. He has produced albums for Bad Religion as well as Epitaph Records labelmates NOFX, Rancid, and Pennywise, among others. Gurewitz also had a project called Error, which also featured Atticus Ross, Leopold Ross, and Greg Puciato. Gurewitz joined Bad Religion in 1980 at the age of 18, when he, Greg Graffin, Jay Bentley and Jay Ziskrout agreed to form a band. After releasing two albums and one EP, Gurewitz left Bad Religion in 1983, but rejoined three years later when the How Could Hell Be Any Worse? line-up (adding guitarist Greg Hetson as the second guitarist) was reuniting, and recorded five more albums with the band before they signed to Atlantic Records in 1993. Their Atlantic debut, Stranger Than Fiction (1994), was a breakthrough success, scoring their biggest hits \"21st Century (Digital Boy)\" and \"Infected\". However, he was overwhelmed by Epitaph's new popularity (including the unexpected success of the label's then-current acts The Offspring and Rancid) and decided to quit Bad Religion once again in 1994. Gurewitz continued working at Epitaph after his departure from Bad Religion, and released the \"Hate You\" single in 1996 with his one-off project Daredevils. During that time, he entered a period of drug addiction. By 1999, Gurewitz had successfully completed drug rehabilitation and reconciled with Graffin to co-write a song \"Believe It\", which appears on Bad Religion's 2000 album The New America. He eventually rejoined the band in 2001 to write and record the album The Process of Belief (2002). He remains with the band today, but only occasionally joins them live, such as when they are performing near his hometown or for televised appearances. Bad Religion has since released four more albums, the latest being True North (2013). Brett hasn't played lead guitar at live performances with Bad Religion since 2007, however he occasionally contributes lead guitar to songs on some records. He did the solo in the song \"Sorrow\", as well the last lead parts of \"Only Rain\", \"Ad Hominem\", and \"My Head Is Full Of Ghosts\". His lead guitar work has been much less frequent on later albums, due greatly to the presence of fellow punk rock veterans, and accomplished musicians, Brian Baker and Greg Hetson. He played no lead guitar on the albums \"New Maps Of Hell\" and \"The Empire Strikes First\". In the past, Brett has engineered several albums using the pseudonym \"The Legendary Starbolt\"."@en ;

Ballard struggled with alcoholism, depression, and poverty for three years. She was making an attempt for a musical comeback when she died of a heart attack in February 1976 at age 32. Ballard's death was considered by one critic as \"one of rock's greatest tragedies\". Ballard was posthumously inducted to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of the Supremes in 1988."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Brian Patrick Carroll (born May 13, 1969), known professionally as Buckethead, is an American guitarist and multi-instrumentalist who has worked within many genres of music. He has released 264 studio albums, four special releases and one EP. He has also performed on more than 50 other albums by other artists. His music spans many diverse areas such as progressive metal, funk, blues, jazz, bluegrass, ambient, and avant-garde music. Buckethead is famous for wearing a KFC bucket on his head, emblazoned with an orange bumper sticker reading FUNERAL in capital black block letters, and an expressionless plain white mask, which, according to Buckethead, was inspired by his seeing Halloween 4: The Return of Michael Myers. At one point, he changed to a plain white bucket that no longer bore the KFC logo, but subsequently reverted to his trademark KFC bucket. He also incorporates nunchaku and robot dancing into his stage performances. As an instrumentalist, Buckethead has received critical acclaim for his electric guitar playing, and is considered one of today's more innovative guitarists. He has been voted number 8 on a list in GuitarOne magazine of the \"Top 10 Fastest Guitar Shredders of All Time\" as well as being included in Guitar World's lists of the \"25 all-time weirdest guitarists\" and the \"50 fastest guitarists of all time\".He performs primarily as a solo artist, though he has collaborated extensively with a wide variety of high-profile artists such as Bill Laswell, Bootsy Collins, Bernie Worrell, Iggy Pop, Les Claypool, Serj Tankian, Bill Moseley, Mike Patton, Viggo Mortensen, That 1 Guy, Bassnectar, and was a member of Guns N' Roses from 2000 to 2004. Buckethead has also written and performed music for major motion pictures, including: Saw II, Ghosts of Mars, Beverly Hills Ninja, Mortal Kombat, Mortal Kombat: Annihilation, Last Action Hero, and contributed lead guitar to the track \"Firebird\" featured on the Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Movie soundtrack."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Regina Ann \"Gina\" Schock (born August 31, 1959 in Baltimore, Maryland) is best known as the drummer in the all-woman rock band The Go-Go's. Schock's career began as drummer for Edie and the Eggs, a band assembled to feature the John Waters star Edith Massey. After her stint in Edie and the Eggs, Schock relocated to Los Angeles, California, and soon joined The Go-Go's. Schock recorded and toured steadily with The Go-Go's until the group disbanded in 1985 and reformed a few years later. She had open-heart surgery before the tour supporting the band's 1984 album Talk Show. In 1985 she was occasionally seen on television appearances as the drummer of the Norwegian band a-ha. However this was just for promo on television as she was never part of the official band. Following the dissolution of The Go-Go's, Schock continued drumming with various artists, and would also hone her singing and songwriting skills. In 1987 she and Vance DeGeneres formed House of Schock, which released one album for Capitol Records. The Go-Go's reformed in 1990; Schock has toured and recorded with them since. She also works as a writer and producer for new bands. Schock's songs have appeared in films including The Accused, Superstar, and Bull Durham. She has acted for television and in several films, including those of underground director Relah Eckstein. Schock has also worked with Gary Myrick, Dominique Davalos, A-ha, Feargal Sharkey, John Mellencamp, Little Richard, Nona Hendryx, Steve Plunkett and Debbi Peterson. Gina has collaborated with Alanis Morissette, Carnie Wilson and Wendy Wilson of the pop trio Wilson Phillips, and Debbie Peterson of The Bangles. Gina also produced the Go-Go's 5.1 DVD of the 2001 concert, Live in Central Park. Most recently, Schock is one of the cowriters of the title track for the Miley Cyrus album Breakout. She also cowrote \"Falling Down\", \"Kiss and Tell\", \"Stop and Erase\", and \"Crush\" for Selena Gomez & the Scene's debut album Kiss & Tell. She currently lives in San Francisco."@en ;

Born in 1947, Riperton grew up in Chicago's Bronzeville neighborhood on the South Side. As a child, she studied music, drama, and dance at Chicago's Lincoln Center. In her teen years, she sang lead vocals for the Chicago-based girl group, The Gems. Her early affiliation with the legendary Chicago-based Chess Records afforded her the opportunity to sing backup for various established artists such as Etta James, Fontella Bass, Ramsey Lewis, Bo Diddley, Chuck Berry, and Muddy Waters. While at Chess, Riperton also sang lead for the experimental rock/soul group Rotary Connection, from 1967 to 1971. On April 5, 1975, Riperton reached the apex of her career with her #1 single, \"Lovin' You\". The single was the last release from her 1974 gold album entitled Perfect Angel. In January 1976, Riperton was diagnosed with breast cancer and underwent a radical mastectomy. By the time of diagnosis, the cancer had metastasized and she was given about six months to live. Despite the grim prognosis, she continued recording and touring. She was one of the first celebrities to go public with her breast cancer diagnosis, but did not disclose she was terminally ill. In 1977, she became a spokesperson for the American Cancer Society. In 1978, she received the American Cancer Society's Courage Award which was presented to her at the White House by President Jimmy Carter. She died at age 31 on July 12, 1979."@en ;

After his debut album Fear Itself garnered both critical and commercial success, Casual went on to become one of the most prominent and recognizable faces on the Hieroglyphics roster, releasing five full-length LPs over the span of his twenty-year career. Despite the lackluster sales of the LPs following his debut, which were preceded by an absence of both critical and popular acclaim, Owens has garnered a following amongst devoted hip hop fans, particularly in the Bay Area hip hop scene, largely due to his specialization in hardcore battle rhymes."@en ;
