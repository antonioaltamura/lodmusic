	dbo:abstract	"Master is a death metal band formed in Chicago, United States in 1983 as the band Warcry fell apart. However, the band was put on hold due to internal problems shortly after its inception. Paul Speckmann then formed the band Death Strike, which in 1985 he renamed to Master. In 1985 Master obtained a record deal with Combat Records and recorded an album, which was not released until 2003 by Displeased Records as Unreleased 1985 album. In 1990 the band was signed by the German label Nuclear Blast Records, who also had contracted Speckmann's other band Abomination. The actual debut album of Master, titled simply Master, was recorded twice; first with Mittelbrun on guitars and Schmidt on drums. This recording was not accepted by the record company Nuclear Blast. Hence it was re-recorded with Nickeas (drums) and Martinelli (guitar), which was eventually released as the Speckmann Project in 1991. The first recording was released under the name Master in 1990. In 1991, the second album was released: On the Seventh Day God Created ... Master, featuring Paul Masvidal on lead guitar, followed by the Collection of Souls in 1993 both on Nuclear Blast. Thereafter their record deal ended and Master went on hiatus to find a new record label. Five years layer, Faith Is in Season was released on Pavement Music. Speckmann then focused on several other projects, including the resurrected Abomination and eventually joined the Czech band Krabathor, for which Speckmann relocated to the Czech Republic. In 2002 the next album was released, titled Let's Start a War on System Shock, which also contracted Krabathor. In 2004 Spirit of the West followed. Master then switched labels again, to the German label Twilight Vertrieb and released Four More Years of Terror in 2005. The album Slaves to Society was released in May 2007. The band embarked on a European tour in May and June 2007, followed by yet another tour with Chicago legend Lividity beginning on September 8, 2007 until September 30, 2007. Slaves to Society has been re-released on Ibex Moon Records in Pennsylvania in September 2008. The spring of 2009 found the band touring successfully for 38 days playing 30 shows across the European continent. The US version of Master toured in July 2009 for 21 shows in America."@en ;

Goswell, Halstead and McCutcheon previously played in Thames Valley shoegazing band Slowdive. The band initially existed as a trio, consisting of Halstead, Goswell, and McCutcheon. After Slowdive were dropped by Creation Records, the trio decided to change musical direction to a dream pop/country rock/folk music style, and were signed by 4AD Records. They took on the new name \"Mojave,\"  but upon the discovery of another band already using the name, the \"3\" was added (in reference to the group's three members). Rowe (formerly of Chapterhouse) and Forrester joined shortly after the release of their first album. Both Halstead (the main songwriter for the band) and Goswell have released solo albums, also for 4AD. McCutcheon founded and is currently playing with his band called The Loose Salute who are signed to Heavenly Records and Graveface Records. In 2006, Mojave 3 did a Take-Away Show session with Vincent Moon. According to Halstead, the band is on hiatus as of 2008, but they are planning to release at least one more album in the future. Despite still being listed as \"on hiatus\", the band returned to playing live in 2011, including gigs supporting Band of Horses. During a radio interview on Israeli radio station Kol HaCampus on 7 May 2011, Halstead said the band are working on new material, and may be recording during the summer."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"New Edition is an American boy band formed in Boston in 1978. The group reached its height of popularity during the 1980s. They were the progenitors of the boy band movement of the 1980s and 1990s and led the way for groups like New Kids on the Block (also formed in the Boston area), The Boys, Boyz II Men, Hi-Five, Backstreet Boys and NSYNC. The group recorded mostly as a quintet. During the group's first bout of fame in 1983, its members were Ricky Bell, Michael Bivins, Bobby Brown, Ronnie DeVoe, and Ralph Tresvant. Early hits included \"Candy Girl,\" \"Cool It Now\" and \"Mr. Telephone Man\". Brown was voted out of the group in 1985 and embarked on a solo career. The group continued for a time with its remaining four members, but eventually recruited singer Johnny Gill, who would be introduced on their 1988 album Heart Break. The group went on hiatus in 1990, while its various members worked on side projects, such as the group Bell Biv DeVoe. Gill and Tresvant also recorded successful solo albums. All six members of New Edition reunited in 1996 to record the group's sixth studio album Home Again. During the ill-fated Home Again Tour, both Bobby Brown and Michael Bivins eventually quit the group, forcing the remainder of the tour to be canceled. Various reunions have occurred since, usually with the 1987-1990 lineup, though occasionally also including Brown. Their last studio album was 2004's One Love. As of 2010, two New Edition descendants were recording and touring: Bell Biv DeVoe and Heads of State (which features Brown, Tresvant and Gill). On May 3, 2011 New Edition issued a press release on their official website announcing that all six members were reuniting as New Edition to kick off the 30th anniversary celebration of \"Candy Girl\" with their fans."@en ;

They subsequently dropped out of their studies to concentrate further on the band that would ultimately become Dream Theater. Though a number of lineup changes followed, the three original members remained together along with James LaBrie and Jordan Rudess until September 8, 2010, when Portnoy left the band. In October 2010, the band held auditions for a drummer to replace Portnoy. Mike Mangini was announced as the new permanent drummer on April 29, 2011. The band is well known for the technical proficiency of its instrumentalists, who have won many awards from music instruction magazines. Guitarist John Petrucci has been named as the third player on the G3 tour six times, more than any invited players. In 2009 he was named the No. 2 best metal guitarist by Joel McIver in his book The 100 Greatest Metal Guitarists. He was also named as one of the \"Top 10 Fastest Shredders of All Time\" by GuitarOne magazine. Jordan Rudess is considered to be one of the greatest keyboard players of all time by many publications like MusicRadar. Former drummer Mike Portnoy has won 26 awards from Modern Drummer magazine and is also the second youngest person (at the age of 37) to be inducted into the Rock Drummer Hall of Fame. His replacement Mike Mangini has also previously set 5 WFD records. John Myung was voted the greatest bassist of all time in a poll conducted by MusicRadar in August through September 2010. The band was inducted into the Long Island Music Hall of Fame in 2010. The band's highest-selling album is the gold-selling Images and Words (1992), which reached No. 61 on the Billboard 200 chart. Both the 1994 release Awake and their 2002 release Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence also entered the charts at No. 32 and No. 46 respectively and received mostly positive reviews. Metropolis Pt. 2: Scenes from a Memory was ranked number 95 on the October 2006 issue of Guitar World magazine's list of The greatest 100 guitar albums of all time. It is ranked as the 15th Greatest Concept Album (as of March 2003) by Classic Rock Magazine and as the number one all-time progressive album by Rolling Stone (as of July 2012). Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence also led to Dream Theater becoming the initial band reviewed in the music section of Entertainment Weekly during its opening week of release, despite the magazine generally preferring more mainstream music. The band's eleventh studio album, A Dramatic Turn of Events, was released on September 13, 2011. On November 30, 2011, the album's lead single, \"On the Backs of Angels\", was nominated for a Grammy Award in the \"Best Hard Rock/Metal Performance\" category, marking the band's first ever Grammy nomination. Dream Theater's self-titled twelfth studio album was released on September 23, 2013 and earned their second Grammy Award nomination, this time for \u201CBest Metal Performance\u201D, for the album's first single, \"The Enemy Inside\". On April 9, 2013, Images and Words won Loudwire's fan voted March Metal Madness for world's best metal album beating albums by Dio, AC/DC, Judas Priest, Megadeth and Metallica. As of 2011, Dream Theater has sold over 12 million records worldwide."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Lost Dogs are an American musical supergroup formed in 1991, comprising vocalists, songwriters, and guitarists from multiple Christian alternative rock bands. Their current lineup includes Terry Scott Taylor (Daniel Amos, the Swirling Eddies), Michael Roe (The 77s), Derri Daugherty and Steve Hindalong (The Choir). The original lineup included Gene Eugene (Adam Again), who died in 2000. The band's eclectic blending of folk, blues, country, and rock has been characterized as \"a sort of CCM equivalent to the Traveling Wilburys\". The band released their debut album Scenic Routes in 1992 as a one-time collaboration. Lost Dogs concert performances are filled with between-song jokes and one-liners between the band members (usually poking fun at each other). Many Lost Dogs albums include at least one or two cover songs. Songs covered by Lost Dogs on an album or in concert include Bob Dylan's \"Lord Protect My Child\", Leonard Cohen's \"If It Be Your Will\", The Beatles' \"I'm A Loser\", \"The Chipmunk Song (Christmas Don't Be Late)\", and Stephen Foster's \"Hard Times, Come Again No More\". In March, 2000, shortly after the release of their Gift Horse album, Gene Eugene died. In 2004, the band got together with Steve Hindalong to produce a special album for their summer tour. The result was entitled MUTT, and included new acoustic versions of ten songs originally written and recorded for each band member's regular rock bands. The following year, the band would release the almost entirely instrumental Island Dreams. The Lost Cabin and the Mystery Trees, was released July 2006. In 2008, the Lost Dogs traveled down historic Route 66 with cinematographer Jimmy Abegg. Abegg filmed the band's experiences. The band then wrote and recorded 14 songs inspired by their journey, which was released as Old Angel in May 2010."@en ;

They then signed to Midnight Records, and two years after their debut released What Remains, produced by Tim Lee of The Windbreakers. Thomas left in 1987, later releasing a series of solo albums, and Kitchen also left, leaving Brown and Rasor to continue, with the acoustic Painted Post EP released in mid-1987. A live album recorded in 1984 followed, released on the Greek Di-Di label, before the original line-up came back together to record their final album, Sand Down the Moon. After disbanding in 1990, an expanded reissue of A Journey Through the Past was released in 2001. In 2003 a remixed edition of Green House: 20th Anniversary Edition with a bonus disc of live recordings was released.

	dbo:abstract	"Folk Face were a comedy band formed in 2005 by BBC Radio 1 DJ Dave Vitty and BBC Newsreader Dominic Byrne. Mainly appearing on The Chris Moyles Show, they also appeared in person at the Glastonbury Festival and at several Radio 1 events. They mainly did cover versions in a tongue-in-cheek folk music style. They appeared at the Glastonbury Festival in 2005, but disbanded soon after, only re-forming for a one-off on 20 June 2007 for The Chris Moyles Show to give away tickets for the Glastonbury Festival 2007. Byrne played guitar for the band, however Vitty played different instruments, these being the bongos in 2005 and the nose flute in 2007. They auditioned for Dave Grohl on 6 July 2007, while Grohl was in London for Live Earth, in the hope of securing a warm up slot at one of the Foo Fighters future gigs. Grohl was reminded of this and asked to consider it while on air on Radio 1 on the 22 November 2007, however no confirmation of an offer for supporting the band, this time for the Radio 1 Foo Fighters Gig at Wembley on 7 June 2008, was made. Folk Face also played live on 15 February 2008, at Mote Park in Kent, when Radio 1 announced that their One Big Weekend would be coming from Maidstone, also playing the actual event on 10 May 2008. Folk Face were mistaken for band Scouting for Girls who also played live at the launch, in the BBC's in-house magazine Ariel. Folk Face auditioned for Sir Andrew Lloyd Webber, for a chance to represent the UK at the 2009 Eurovision Song Contest. Folk Face failed to impress Lloyd Webber, who commented that the lyrics could have upset Russia among other countries. More recently, Folk Face played a song at the 2009 Big Weekend in Swindon, as part of the breakfast show team's set of song parodies. They also toured the UK for the first time through August and September 2010. On 11 April 2011, they announced on The Chris Moyles Show that Folk Face would play Glastonbury Festival 2011. On 10 January 2013 Dominic Byrne tweeted that it was a \"sad day today with the news that Folkface are no more.\" However, he did state that there was the possibility that the band could re-form for a farewell show in the summer."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Friends of the Bride were a short-lived London-based indie pop band (sometimes shortened to 'FoTB'). Consisting of Bobby Grindrod (vocals), Osamu Yano (guitar), Kerin Smith (bass) and Billy Reeves AKA Brian Feltham (drums); the band won the 2006 London leg of the BBC's Electric Proms 'Next Stage' competition and secured their first gig as part of the festival (which also featured performances by The Who, James Brown and Paul Weller). Drawing from a diverse range of influences that included 1960s jazz, Northern soul and Y\u00E9-y\u00E9 as well as new wave music, garage rock and Anthony Newley, the band employed a traditional 'Tin Pan Alley'-inspired songwriting approach. Despite their traditional indie format (guitar, bass, drums and vocals), front man Bobby Grindrod was known for his unique jazz-influenced vocal style and they were cited by The Times as \"head[ing] the nu croon scene\". In 2007, Grindrod's unusually smart appearance (influenced by early to mid-1960s fashion) prompted London's Metro newspaper to run a full page style feature on him. Such shameless appreciation for 1960s styling has led to accusations of 'retroism', however the band refuted this; claiming that all contemporary music is clearly and heavily indebted to the past and therefore \"[i]n its current usage, 'retro' is a misleading and repressive term that should be avoided at all costs\". Friends of the Bride released two singles (Buckle Up, Sunshine! and So, You Think You Can Dance?) on London's Young and Lost Club label in 2007 as well as contributing You Can't Take him Anywhere and Hey Buddy to a split EP (also featuring contributions from Manchester electro-pop group, Modernaire) on Brainlove Records in 2008. Between 2000 and 2006, Bobby Grindrod fronted Bath-based new wave/garage rock outfit, The Fog Band who released an acclaimed EP The Law of The Sea on Bath's Purr Records. Initially, his vocal approach was heavily influenced by 1960s Rhythm and blues but as the band progressed he began to experiment with a 'cleaner' vocal approach (retained and developed in Friends of the Bride). Fog Band songwriter Oli Daltrey (son of Peter Daltrey, lead singer of 1960s psychedelic band, Kaleidoscope) began to accommodate this development in songs like 'The Cummerbund Years' and an exciting future beckoned. Despite this, the band soon became inexplicably defunct. In 2006, Grindrod contributed to the short-lived music project, A Conversation Piece alongside Pagan Wanderer Lu and Simon Love (lead singer of The Loves). He also provided some backing vocals and narration on The Loves' second album, Technicolour, in the same year. Billy Reeves and Kerin Smith previously performed in '90s indie band theaudience alongside Sophie Ellis-Bextor."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Get Well Soon is a music and band project of the German singer, songwriter and instrumentalist Konstantin Gropper (born September 28, 1982 in Biberach an der Ri\u00DF, Upper Swabia, Baden-W\u00FCrttemberg). Gropper worked 3 years on his debut album Rest Now, Weary Head! You Will Get Well Soon which was released in Germany, Austria, Switzerland, France, Benelux, Spain, Italy by the Label City Slang and by Nude Records in the UK and Ireland in January 2008 following lots of positive reviews in the biggest German, French and UK music magazines. The lyrics are known to be slightly philosophical and cynical (e.g. Witches! Witches! Rest Now In The Fire and We Are Safe Inside While They Burn Down Our House). The album entered the German Album Charts on no. 28. It also entered the Austrian and Swiss charts and was successful in Benelux as well. The release tour with 19 most sold out shows was the most successful newcomer tour in Germany in 2008. The Album release was followed by great press reviews (NME, Word Magazine, Uncut, Artrocker, Guardian). The album was released in France in September 2008 and entered the official French album charts on no. 91. In 2008 Konstantin Gropper also wrote exclusive tracks for the latest Wim Wenders movie Palermo Shooting, alongside other artists like Portishead and Nick Cave. The second album Vexations was released in Europe in January 2010. Unlike the debut, it was preproduced by Konstantin Gropper and then was recorded with a full band in a studio. It entered the German album charts at number 11 (charts entries in most European countries) and the European charts on 52. It was followed by great press reviews (NME, Word Magazin, Mojo, Musikexpress, Visions, Spex, Uncle Sallys, FAZ, SZ, Le Monde, Liberation etc..). The release was followed by a soldout 36 shows tour throughout Europe. In 2011 Konstantin Gropper wrote the scoremusic to the first season of the French series Xanadu, which was broadcast in France and Germany by ARTE TV."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Humanimal was a musical project featuring Pontus Norgren (Great King Rat) and Marcel Jacob (Talisman). The band's name idea come from Marcel Jacob who used the following quote: \"...we might be human but in the end, we still being animals\". The main idea was to have a hard rock record with three singers: Leif Sundin (Great King Rat, John Norum, Michael Schenker Group), Jeff Scott Soto (Talisman, ex-Yngwie Malmsteen) and Mats Lev\u00E9n (Krux, At Vance, ex-Yngwie Malmsteen). After some research and testing, they decided to go with one singer, because they also thought it would be easier for the listeners if they only used one, and well they chose Jeff Scott Soto. After that, again Norgren and Jacob were thinking about who could be the best drummer that they should use for that kind of musical project and they chose Tomas Broman (Great King Rat, Electric Boys, Amaze Me, Hughes Turner Project, Glenn Hughes). They released their only record on January 28, 2002 in USA and February 1 in Europe, but by popular demand the record label made a second edition to reach at least three European countries. Also on June 17, 2002, the record label released a 3-track EP called \"Find My Way Home\". In May the band played a couple of shows to support it. Unfortunately, this was not a good moment for the guys owing to some personal, professional and legal problems. Pontus and Marcel had a falling-out and this meant that Pontus was out both of Talisman and Humanimal, then on October 19 of that year, Humanimal split."@en ;

The group was conceived by record producer Igor Matviyenko, and initially consisted of Andrei Grigoriev-Apollonov, Kirill Andreev, and primary vocalist Igor Sorin. They performed under several names (such as \"Apollo-Soyuz\") before settling on \"Ivanushki International\", a name meant to represent their intended blend of Russian (\"Little Ivans\") and international influences, and itself written half in Cyrillic, half in the Latin alphabet, with the second word read as in English. Their debut album, \u041A\u043E\u043D\u0435\u0447\u043D\u043E \u043E\u043D (Konyechno on, Of Course It's Him), was released in 1996. It included three cover versions of songs from the 1980s \u2013 \"\u0412\u0441\u0435\u043B\u0435\u043D\u043D\u0430\u044F\" (Vselennaya, \"The Universe\"), originally performed by Alexander Ivanov, and \"\u0420\u043E\u043D\u0434\u043E\" (Rondo, \"Roundabout\"), \"\u042D\u0442\u0430\u0436\u0438\" (Etazhi, \"Levels\"), and \"\u041C\u0430\u043B\u0438\u043D\u0430\" (\"Malina\", \"Rasberry\") by the group Class. However, it contained several original songs, including the hits \"\u0422\u0443\u0447\u0438\" (Tuchi, \"Clouds\"), \"\u041A\u043E\u043B\u0435\u0447\u043A\u043E\" (Kolechko, \"The Ring\"), \"\u0413\u0434\u0435-\u0442\u043E\" (Gdye-to, \"Somewhere\"), and \"\u041E\u043D\u0430\" (Ona, \"She\"). A remixed version of the album followed one year later, Konyechno on remixed. The remixes were created by Lubeh keyboardist Igor Polonsky, Moral Code X keyboardist Konstantin Smirnov, and DJ Maxim Milyutenko. Alongside the remixed versions, the album contained the new hit \"\u041A\u0443\u043A\u043B\u0430\" (Kukla, \"Doll\") and a cover version of the Lubeh song \"\u0414\u0443\u0441\u044F\" (Dusya). Ivanushki's second studio album, \u0422\u0432\u043E\u0438 \u043F\u0438\u0441\u044C\u043C\u0430 (Tvoi pisma, Your Letters), released later in 1997, repeated the existing formula of original material and covers of past hits. It also included an audio letter from the group. Later that year, Igor Sorin left to pursue a solo career, and was replaced by Oleg Yakovlev, who had appeared in the music video for \"Doll\". Without Sorin, the group continued its string of successes, releasing its perhaps best known song \"\u0422\u043E\u043F\u043E\u043B\u0438\u043D\u044B\u0439 \u043F\u0443\u0445\" (Topoliny pukh, \"Poplar Fuzz\"), a number-one hit in the summer of 1998. On September 1, 1998, Sorin committed suicide, jumping from the window of his high-rise apartment, and died three days later. The following year, the group released \u0424\u0440\u0430\u0433\u043C\u0435\u043D\u0442\u044B \u0436\u0438\u0437\u043D\u0438 (Fragmenti iz zhizni, Fragments of Life), their tribute to him, which contained songs he had written prior to joining Ivanushki, as well as poems he had written, and a song dedicated to him, \"\u042F \u0442\u0435\u0431\u044F \u043D\u0438\u043A\u043E\u0433\u0434\u0430 \u043D\u0435 \u0437\u0430\u0431\u0443\u0434\u0443\" (Ya tyebya nikogda nye zabudu, \"I Will Never Forget You\").

	foaf:name	"Kill II This"@en ;
	dbo:abstract	"Kill II This (sometimes typeset as Kill 2 This) are a Metal band from Manchester, England. KILL II THIS blend extreme metal music with elements of industrial electronica, hip-hop and even opera. Terrorizer magazine summed it up by saying, \"Their sound crosses clever industrial style sampling with fearsome guitar. Kill II This have created a beast which is threatening yet danceable.\" They experienced the highs of critical acclaim and prestigious tours. They also had to deal with forced line up changes, which from time to time tested the band's resolve. But with guitarist Mark Mynett at the helm they carried on regardless, creating one innovative album after another. The first album, \"Another Cross II Bare,\" was released in 1997 and featured Jeff Singer (drums), Pete Stone (Bass) and Nick Arlea (vocals). KILL II THIS supported GRIP INC. and SKINLAB for some UK dates in June 1997 then MEGADETH on their \"Cryptic Writings\" European tour. In 1998 the second album, \"Deviate,\" was released to huge praise from press and fans alike. Matt Pollock and Caroline Campbell were recruited for vocal and bass duties, while Ben Calvert replaced Jeff Singer on drums for touring duties after the album had been recorded. Metal Hammer's review said, \"Here is an album brimming with deflowered gems; downbeat riffs that don't depress and confident grooves.\" 2000 saw KILL II THIS out on a British tour supported by EARTHTONE 9 and LINEA 77. The band's third effort, \"Trinity,\" featured FEAR FACTORY frontman Burton C. Bell guesting on the cover of FRANKIE GOES TO HOLLYWOOD's \"Two Tribes.\" The band was confirmed as support to the GODFLESH and DEVIN TOWNSEND package tour of Britain during December 2001. They would also open for SOIL's UK debut gig in January 2002. Kerrang! said, \" Kill II This set about putting the last 20 years of heavy guitar music into a blender, and arrive at a sound that puts them out as one of THE most cutting edge bands around.\" The fourth album, 2003's 'Mass.[Down.]-Sin.(Drone) was recorded with vocalist Phil Bretnall and drummer Steve Rooney. Pete Stone returned on bass. European tours with Anthrax, Fear Factory, Type O Negative, Slipknot and Machine Head followed as well as a headline European tour with Area 54 as support. In the Spring of 2004 Mark Mynett revealed that the fifth KILL II THIS album would be the band's last. However, plans for the swan song KILL II THIS outing took on a new direction when the record, entitled, \"A New Spiritual Mountain,\" was released under the brand new band name CITY OF GOD. This new outfit comprised Jeff Singer, fresh from his stints with PARADISE LOST and BLAZE, Simon Gordon, ex-XENTRIX / Hellfighter, and Tim Preston, ex-DEARLY BEHEADED. The band didn't tour in support of this album and it seemed KILL II THIS had indeed come to an end. Mark Mynett is now a Senior Lecturer in Music Technology & Production at the University of Huddersfield and currently resides in Manchester, England. Mynett has recently had the cover feature published in November 2009's issue of Sound on Sound magazine where he discusses 'Extreme Metal Production'. Mynett still actively produces albums from his studio in Huddersfield, England."@en ;

When searching for other band members, they asked bassist John Lev\u00E9n, drummer Ian Haugland and keyboardist Mic Michaeli, all from the band Europe, if they were interested to be part of this new musical project and since that moment the band began working on their self-titled debut album, which was released in 2003. By the time they began working on their second album, II, Europe had reunited, and Last Autumn's Dream had to replace Lev\u00E9n, Haugland and Michaeli with Marcel Jacob (Talisman), Jamie Borger (Talisman, Treat) and Thomas Lassar (Crystal Blue), respectively. II was released in 2005. Thomas Lassar left the band after II, paring the band down to a quartet. The band then released the albums Winter in Paradise in 2006 and Saturn Skyline in 2007. On June 6, 2007, the band released their first greatest hits album, Impressions: The Very Best of LAD, an exclusive released for the Japanese market.

The Chorale consists of trained volunteer musicians from the greater New York City area and seeks to broaden public interest in fine choral music by performing a full range of musical styles at the highest quality. Audience members have commended the warmth and body of the chorale\u2019s tone, and a concert review in Soundview News praised its \u201Cpoignant elegance.\u201D Since its premiere at Lincoln Center\u2019s Alice Tully Hall in 2006, the Chorale has expanded its artistic influence, performing two concerts in its most recent season. To date, the New York City Master Chorale has performed at a variety of venues, including Carnegie Hall, Lincoln Center's Avery Fisher Hall, Riverside Church, Church of St. Paul the Apostle and Symphony Space, and has collaborated with both the Park Avenue Symphony and the Astoria Symphony. Recent repertoire has included Beethoven\u2019s Ninth Symphony, the Mozart Requiem, Rachmaninoff\u2019s Vespers, the Faur\u00E9 Requiem, Leonard Bernstein\u2019s Chichester Psalms and Morten Lauridsen\u2019s Lux \u00C6terna, along with choral works by American composers including Aaron Copland, Samuel Barber and Randall Thompson, and spirituals by Moses Hogan. During the 2008\u20132009 season, the Chorale premiered a new American work for chorus, orchestra and narrator at Lincoln Center. The Journey, composed by Aaron Fruchtman, tells the tale of pioneers moving west on the Oregon Trail. The performance was narrated by Academy Award nominee Bruce Dern. During the 2009 - 2010 season, the Chorale presented the Durufl\u00E9 Requiem. They also collaborated with the Rock Creek Singers of the Gay Men's Chorus of Washington DC to present the Durufl\u00E9 Messe Cum Jubilo. The 2010 - 2011 season was the Chorale's Fifth Anniversary season, during which the Chorale had its European debut, performing the European premiere of Paul Leavitt: Requime at \u00C9glise Saint-Sulpice. The Chorale also performed at St. Patrick's Cathedral in December 2010. The New York City Master Chorale also has a commitment to providing outreach to New York City\u2019s public schools and community. In addition to engaging community members through its regular concerts, Dr. Kano and the singers visit low-income public schools, exposing more than 400 students per year to choral music. These classroom lessons include conversations with students about the value and role of classical music and providing them with complimentary tickets to the chorale\u2019s concerts. The majority of the students who partake in the program and who attend the concerts have had little to no exposure to classical music. Additionally, the Chorale performs free concerts at area churches to bring the experience of classical music to local communities. NYCMC is the only New York City area chorus with such outreach programs in its schools and community."@en ;

Additionally, their reality-based lyrics characterized by political/modern themes are notable in death metal. Various line-up changes throughout the years have left John Gallagher the remaining original member, as well as the band's driving force. According to Gallagher, the band name was chosen while the members were of adolescent ages and was intended to be offensive."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"EPMD is an American hip hop group from Brentwood, New York. The group's name is a concatenation of the members' names \"E\" and \"PMD\" or an acronym for \"Erick and Parrish Making Dollars\", referencing its members, emcees Erick Sermon (\"E\" aka E Double) and Parrish Smith (\"PMD\" aka Parrish Mic Doc). During an interview on college radio station WHOV in 1987, Parrish Smith stated that the name evolved from the original: \"We were originally known as \"EEPMD\" (Easy Erick and Parrish the Microphone Doctor), but chose to go with EPMD because it was easier to say.\" He also stated that they dropped the two \"E's\" because N.W.A.'s Eric Wright was already using \"Eazy-E\" as his stage name. The group has been active for 31 years (minus two breakups in 1993 and 1999), and is one of the most prominent acts in east coast hip hop. Diamond J and DJ K La Boss were DJs for the group and their current DJ is DJ Scratch The word \"business\" is used in every title of the group's albums. Every album also has a track with \"Jane\" in the title."@en ;

Among other periodicals, they have been featured in Rolling Stone Magazine, CMJ, and The Cincinnati Post. The Ass Ponys went on hiatus in 2005, after releasing the compilation album The Okra Years - 4 years after their last original material was released in Lohio. More importantly, it appears that core band members are focused on new projects, so new Ass Ponys output seems unlikely any time soon. Vocalist Chuck Cleaver is focusing his attention on a new band, Wussy. Bill Alletzhauser currently fronts the band The Hiders. Randy Cheek plays with The Libertines US, The Fairmount Girls and The Ready Stance. Chuck Cleaver and Randy Cheek performed together at TedxCincinnati in November 2013.

	dbo:abstract	"Kind of Pluto is an Australian band. It was formed in 2002 by Melbourne singer/songwriter Steven Gates and drummer Simm Thom. Later, they added keyboardist Ben Ryderman and bassist Tommy Kende. Gates, who also performs with the comedy group Tripod, has been writing and performing his own original music since the age of sixteen. Before Kind of Pluto, Gates refined his songwriting skills by performing solo acoustic spots all over Australia. In 1999, he took his songs as far as New York City and Philadelphia. Gates decided to create an acoustic duo with friend and drummer Simm Thom. Kind of Pluto's first EP was launched on 19 October 2001 at Melbourne's 9th Ward. Kind of Pluto received nationwide airplay with their first release, a self-titled EP described by Time Off Magazine as \"brilliantly warm, fresh and ethereal. Absolutely shines with inspiration.\" The EP's first track, Familiar, was given strong rotation on the Triple J network. A 'Live at the Wireless' session for Richard Kingsmill's Oz Music Show brought them much attention from listeners and record companies alike. \"Everyone's A Pornstar\" was played on the Triple J network as well. The band was also been chosen by Nova 100 as Melbourne Band of the Week and enjoyed extensive radio play with Sleepwalker. Other radio stations to support Kind of Pluto include Triple R and PBS. Since early 2005, the band has been on an extended hiatus - perhaps never to return - with Ben Rynderman departing the group at the end of 2004."@en ;

The group, also known as The I.N.C., included Eyceurokk (Eyce, Uneek and Rokkdiesel), Lord Digga, Paula Perry and R&B vocalist Leschea. Ace first gained notice in the rap world as a member of the legendary Juice Crew, and with the release of his acclaimed 1990 debut Take a Look Around, which featured an appearance from Eyceurokk. In 1992, Ace formed the I.N.C. crew and recorded their first group album, SlaughtaHouse, which was released in May 1993. Ace provided almost all of the rapping, with Lord Digga serving as the hype-man. Digga was also responsible for a bulk of the beats, producing five of the album's songs as part of the duo Bluez Brothers. Paula Perry was the main performer on the song \"Who U Jackin'?\", Leschea provided vocals for \"Don't Fuck Around (Outro)\", and Eyceurokk appeared on the tracks '\"Slaughtahouse\"' (as MC Negro), \"Ain't U Da Masta\" and \"Saturday Nite Live\". The album was highly acclaimed, but sold only moderately well. Some versions of SlaughtaHouse included the hidden bonus track, \"Born to Roll\", which became a huge hit in 1994, breaking into the Top 25 on the Billboard Hot 100 singles chart. Eyceurokk split from the crew after SlaughtaHouse, leaving the group to four members. In 1995, the crew released their second album, Sittin' On Chrome, which featured \"Born to Roll\", as well as two more Hot 100 hit singles, \"The I.N.C. Ride\" and \"Sittin' on Chrome\". The album, produced by Ace, Bluez Bruthas (Lord Digga and Witch Doctor), Uneek and Louie Vega, featured a sound Ace called \"Brooklyn Bass Music\". The album was also highly acclaimed, and sold better than SlaughtaHouse, but still wasn't able to push a strong amount of units. The crew split up in 1996, after Ace began having personal conflicts with Lord Digga and Paula Perry. Ace was largely missing from the scene until 2001, when he returned with his acclaimed solo album Disposable Arts. According to a 2006 interview on Prince Paul's XM Radio show, Ace stated that he and Lord Digga are finally speaking again, but Ace has yet to collaborate with either Digga or Paula Perry since the crew's break-up. However, he did work with Leschea on \"Type I Hate\" from his 2001 album, Disposable Arts and \"Bklyn Masala\" from his 2004 album, A Long Hot Summer."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"A-ha (stylized as a-ha; Norwegian pronunciation: [\u0251\u02C8h\u0251\u02D0]) is a Norwegian band formed in Oslo in 1982. The band was founded by Morten Harket (vocals), Magne Furuholmen (keyboards) and P\u00E5l Waaktaar-Savoy (guitars). The group rose to fame during the mid-1980s after being discovered by musician and producer John Ratcliff, and continued global success in the 1990s and 2000s. A-ha achieved their biggest success with their debut album, Hunting High and Low, in 1985. That album peaked at number one in their native Norway, number 2 in the UK, and number 15 on the US Billboard album chart; yielded two international number-one singles, \"Take On Me\" and \"The Sun Always Shines on TV\"; and earned the band a Grammy Award nomination as Best New Artist. In the UK, Hunting High and Low continued its chart success into the following year, becoming one of the best-selling albums of 1986. In 1994, after their fifth studio album, Memorial Beach, failed to achieve the commercial success of their previous albums, the band went on a hiatus. Following a performance at the Nobel Peace Prize Concert in 1998, the band returned to the studio and recorded their sixth album, 2000's Minor Earth Major Sky, which was another number-one hit in Norway and resulted in a new tour. A seventh studio album, Lifelines, was released in 2002, and an eighth album, Analogue, in 2005, was certified Silver in the UK \u2013 their most successful album there since 1990's East of the Sun, West of the Moon. Their ninth album, Foot of the Mountain, was first released on 19 June 2009 and returned the band to the UK top 5 for the first time since 1988, being certified Silver there and Platinum in Germany. The album peaked at number 2 in Norway (their first release not to reach number one in their home territory). On 15 October 2009, the band announced they would split after a worldwide tour in 2010, the Ending on a High Note Tour. Thousands of fans from at least 40 different countries on six continents congregated to see A-ha for the last leg of the tour. On 4 December 2014, A-ha officially announced its participation at Rock In Rio 2015 which celebrated 30 years for both the band and the event. In 2015, it was announced that A-ha would re-unite for two years. Their tenth studio album, Cast in Steel, was released on 4 September 2015. A tour, named for the album, in support of the album happened in autumn 2015 and March\u2013May 2016. Through 2009, the band has sold more than 100 million records worldwide. In less than a year, during 2010, the band earned an estimated 500 million Norwegian Kroner from concert tickets, merchandise and the release of a greatest hits album, making them one of the 40\u201350 largest grossing bands in the world. The band were (and still are) listed in the Guinness World Records book, beginning in 1991, for having the largest paying audience; they shocked the international entertainment press by drawing an audience of 198,000 at Rio's Maracan\u00E3 Stadium. Another record for the band is for singer Morten Harket, who was (and is still) listed in the Guinness World Records book in 2001 for the longest live note held; he held a note in Summer Moved On for 22 seconds."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"A Perfect Circle is an American rock supergroup formed in 1999 by guitarist Billy Howerdel and Tool vocalist Maynard James Keenan. The original incarnation of the band also included Paz Lenchantin on bass, Troy Van Leeuwen on guitar, and Tim Alexander on drums, with Josh Freese as the primary drummer after the band's initial round of touring prior to their first album. The latest lineup features Puscifer and Ashes Divide bassist Matt McJunkins; former The Smashing Pumpkins guitarist James Iha; and Puscifer and Ashes Divide touring drummer, Jeff Friedl. Despite having a varied cast since inception, the stylistic content of the songs has remained consistent with Howerdel as composer, and Keenan penning the lyrics and melodies. A Perfect Circle has released three albums: their debut Mer de Noms in 2000, a follow up, Thirteenth Step in 2003, and an album of cover songs titled Emotive in 2004. Shortly after Emotive's release, the band went into hiatus while members focused on other projects, the most notably being Keenan's work with Tool and Puscifer, and Howerdel's putting out a solo album, Keep Telling Myself It's Alright, under the moniker Ashes Divide. In late 2008, Keenan and Howerdel announced the band would reform, though the band's activity would ultimately be sporadic in the coming years. The band toured in 2011 and 2013, and then released a live album, A Perfect Circle Live: Featuring Stone and Echo, and a greatest hits album, Three Sixty in late 2013. Work on new material has been alluded to by members since 2008, though progress has been slow due to Keenan's other commitments and uncertainty in the direction of the releases. The only new studio material released since the band's hiatus was the single \"By and Down\" in 2013."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Aerosmith is an American rock band, sometimes referred to as \"the Bad Boys from Boston\" and \"America's Greatest Rock and Roll Band\". Their style, which is rooted in blues-based hard rock, has come to also incorporate elements of pop, heavy metal, and rhythm and blues, and has inspired many subsequent rock artists. They were formed in Boston, Massachusetts in 1970. Guitarist Joe Perry and bassist Tom Hamilton, originally in a band together called the Jam Band, met up with vocalist/pianist/harmonicist Steven Tyler, drummer Joey Kramer, and guitarist Ray Tabano, and formed Aerosmith. In 1971, Tabano was replaced by Brad Whitford, and the band began developing a following in Boston. They were signed to Columbia Records in 1972, and released a string of gold and platinum albums, beginning with their 1973 eponymous debut album, followed by Get Your Wings in 1974. In 1975, the band broke into the mainstream with the album Toys in the Attic, and their 1976 follow-up Rocks cemented their status as hard rock superstars. Two additional albums followed in 1977 and 1979. Their first five albums have since attained multi-platinum status. Throughout the 1970s, the band toured extensively and charted a dozen Hot 100 singles. By the end of the decade, they were among the most popular hard rock bands in the world and developed a loyal following of fans, often referred to as the \"Blue Army\". However, drug addiction and internal conflict took their toll on the band, which led to the departures of Perry and Whitford in 1979 and 1981, respectively; they were replaced by Jimmy Crespo and Rick Dufay. The band did not fare well between 1980 and 1984, releasing the album Rock in a Hard Place, which was certified gold but failed to match their previous successes. Perry and Whitford returned to Aerosmith in 1984 and the band signed a new deal with Geffen Records. After a comeback tour, the band recorded Done with Mirrors (1985), which won some critical praise but failed to come close to commercial expectations. It was not until the band's collaboration with rap group Run\u2013D.M.C. in 1986, and the 1987 multi-platinum release Permanent Vacation, that they regained the level of popularity they had experienced in the 1970s. In the late 1980s and 1990s, the band scored several hits and won numerous awards for music from the multi-platinum albums Pump (1989), Get a Grip (1993), and Nine Lives (1997), and embarked on their most extensive concert tours to date. The band also became a pop culture phenomenon with popular music videos and notable appearances in television, film, and video games. Their comeback has been described as one of the most remarkable and spectacular in rock 'n' roll history. Additional albums followed in 2001, 2004, and 2012. Since 2001, the band has toured every year except 2008. After 47 years of performing, the band continues to tour and record music, but is contemplating a farewell tour slated to begin in 2017. Aerosmith is the best-selling American hard rock band of all time, having sold more than 150 million records worldwide, including over 70 million records in the United States alone. With 25 gold albums, 18 platinum albums, and 12 multi-platinum albums, they hold the record for the most total certifications by an American band and are tied for the most multi-platinum albums by an American band. The band has scored 21 Top 40 hits on the Billboard Hot 100, nine number-one Mainstream Rock hits, four Grammy Awards, six American Music Awards, and ten MTV Video Music Awards. They were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2001, and were included among both Rolling Stone's and VH1's lists of the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time. In 2013, the band's principal songwriters, Tyler and Perry, were inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Alabama is an American country, Southern rock and bluegrass band formed in Fort Payne, Alabama in 1969. The band was founded by Randy Owen (lead vocals, rhythm guitar) and his cousin Teddy Gentry (bass guitar, background vocals), soon joined by their other cousin, Jeff Cook (lead guitar, fiddle, keyboards). First operating under the name Wildcountry, the group toured the Southeast bar circuit in the early 1970s, and began writing original songs. They changed their name to Alabama in 1977 and following the chart success of two singles, were approached by RCA Records for a record deal. Alabama's biggest success came in the 1980s, where the band had over 27 number one hits, seven multi-platinum albums and received numerous awards. Alabama's first single on RCA Records, \"Tennessee River\", began a streak of number one singles, including \"Love in the First Degree\" (1981), \"Mountain Music\" (1982), \"Dixieland Delight\" (1983), \"If You're Gonna Play in Texas (You Gotta Have a Fiddle in the Band)\" (1984) and \"Song of the South\" (1987). The group's popularity waned slightly in the 1990s, although they continued to produce hit singles and multi-platinum record sales. Alabama disbanded in 2006 following a farewell tour and two albums of inspirational music, but reunited in 2010 and have continued to record and tour worldwide. The band's blend of traditional country music and Southern rock combined with elements of gospel, and pop music gave it a crossover appeal that helped lead to their success. They also toured extensively and incorporated production elements such as lighting and \"sets\" inspired by rock concerts into their shows. The band has over 30 number one country records on the Billboard charts to their credit and have sold over 75 million records, making them one of the world's best-selling bands of all time. AllMusic credited the band with popularizing the idea of a country band, and wrote that \"it's unlikely that any other country group will be able to surpass the success of Alabama.\""@en ;

Tolkien\u2032s Middle-earth. The band's lyrics mostly deal with the Vikings, their mythology and their history, and thus Amon Amarth is often considered one of the leading Viking metal bands. The band is composed of vocalist Johan Hegg, guitarists Olavi Mikkonen and Johan S\u00F6derberg and bassist Ted Lundstr\u00F6m. Amon Amarth has released ten studio albums, one compilation album, one EP, one video album, and ten music videos. Its first studio album, Once Sent from the Golden Hall, debuted in 1998. Four more studio releases followed, before the band saw its breakthrough with the 2008 album Twilight of the Thunder God, which debuted at No. 11 on the Swedish album charts and No. 50 on the US Billboard 200. Three more albums, Surtur Rising, Deceiver of the Gods, and Jomsviking followed in 2011, 2013, and 2016, respectively."@en ;

The group formed in 1989 and achieved huge success around the globe in the late 1990s and early 2000s. The group released three albums: Aquarium in 1997, Aquarius in 2000 and Megalomania in 2011. The group sold an estimated 33 million albums and singles, making them the most profitable Danish band ever. In their prime, Aqua's singles managed to chart top ten in a number of countries where European pop acts would not normally succeed, including the United States, Canada, Brazil, Australia, and Japan. The group managed to top the UK Singles Chart with three of their singles. The group also caused controversy with the double entendres in their \"Barbie Girl\" single, with the Barbie doll makers Mattel filing a lawsuit against the group. The lawsuit was finally dismissed by a judge in 2002, who ruled \"The parties are advised to chill.\" The band's members are vocalists Lene Nystr\u00F8m and Ren\u00E9 Dif, keyboardist S\u00F8ren Rasted, and guitarist Claus Norreen. During their split, Nystr\u00F8m, Dif and Rasted all achieved solo chart success, and Norreen continued in the music industry remixing other artists' material. At a press event on 26 October 2007, the group announced a reunion tour, as well as the release of a compilation album featuring new material. Their third album, Megalomania, was released on 3 October 2011."@en ;

Sugababes singer Heidi Range was included in the original line-up but was replaced by Hamilton. The group's debut album Right Now was released in October 2000 and peaked at number 39 in the UK. After four top ten singles, Katona quit the group and was replaced by former Precious singer Jenny Frost. \"Whole Again\" (recorded before Katona left), their next single, became their most successful single when it topped the UK singles chart and became the 13th best-selling single of the 2000s. The group re-released their debut album, with some tracks re-recorded with Frost's vocals. The album hit number one in the UK with the album going double platinum after selling over 600,000 copies in the UK. Between 2002 and 2004, the group released a further two studio albums, Feels So Good (which also went double platinum in the UK) and Ladies Night, and a greatest hits album before announcing a break following their 2004 tour. To date the group have had three UK number-one singles: \"Whole Again\", the fourth-best-selling song of all time by a girl group; \"Eternal Flame\", a song originally recorded by The Bangles; and \"The Tide Is High (Get the Feeling)\", a song originally recorded by The Paragons and by Blondie. The group split up in 2004 after selling over 10 million records worldwide. After making sporadic appearances in 2006 and 2008, it was announced that McClarnon, Hamilton, and Katona would reunite for the ITV2 series The Big Reunion, along with five other pop groups of their time\u2014B*Witched, Five, Liberty X, Honeyz and 911. Frost was unable to take part in the comeback because of her pregnancy, but Hamilton has since confirmed that Frost would be welcomed back if she wanted to rejoin the group in the future."@en ;

In 2016, Bandana announced a reunion concert (without Ivonne Guzm\u00E1n) at the Lola Membrives Theatre in Buenos Aires; due to the high demand for tickets, the group has added five more dates.

The quartet was one of the Soviet Union's best known in the West during the Cold War era, through concert performances in the United States and Europe and through distribution of their recordings. The quartet had a close relationship with composer Dmitri Shostakovich, who personally consulted them on each of his quartets. They also performed with the pianist Sviatoslav Richter on many occasions. They have recorded all of Shostakovich's string quartets as well as all of Beethoven's quartets. Their many recordings include works by a wide range of composers on the Melodiya, Teldec, Virgin Records, and Chandos Records labels. The original Borodin quartet's sound was characterised by an almost symphonic volume and a highly developed ability to phrase whilst maintaining group cohesion. Although it has seen many changes in personnel over its life span, all members of the quartet have been graduates of the Moscow Conservatory."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"The Cherry Poppin' Daddies are an American band established in Eugene, Oregon in 1989. Formed by singer Steve Perry and bassist Dan Schmid, the band has experienced many membership changes over the years, with only Perry, Schmid and trumpeter Dana Heitman currently remaining from the founding line-up. The Daddies' music is primarily a mix of swing and ska, contrastingly encompassing both traditional jazz-influenced forms of the genres as well as modern rock, pop and punk hybrids, characterized by a prominent horn section and Perry's darkly mordant lyricism. While the band's earliest releases were rooted mostly in punk rock and funk, their subsequent studio albums have since incorporated elements from many diverse genres of popular music and Americana into their sound, including rockabilly, rhythm and blues, soul and world music. Having first established themselves in the West Coast third wave ska scene, the Daddies ultimately broke into the musical mainstream with their 1997 swing compilation Zoot Suit Riot. Released at the onset of the late 1990s swing revival, Zoot Suit Riot sold over two million copies in the United States while its eponymous single became a radio hit, launching the Daddies to the forefront of the neo-swing movement. By the end of the decade, however, the Daddies' mainstream popularity declined with that of the swing revival's, and the resulting commercial failure of their ska-flavored follow-up Soul Caddy led to an abrupt hiatus in 2000. The Daddies officially regrouped in 2002 to resume part-time touring, eventually returning to recording with the independently released Susquehanna in 2008. Their tenth and most recent album The Boop-A-Doo, a collection of 1920s and 1930s cover songs, was released in January 2016."@en ;

The band's music received praise across the media, especially from the BBC, which played a large part in their rise to prominence by promoting Florence and the Machine as part of BBC Introducing. At the 2009 Brit Awards they received the Brit Awards \"Critics' Choice\" award. The band's music is renowned for its dramatic and eccentric production and also Welch's powerful vocal performances. The band's debut studio album, Lungs, was released on 6 July 2009, and held the number-two position for its first five weeks on the UK Albums Chart. On 17 January 2010, the album reached the top position, after being on the chart for twenty-eight consecutive weeks. As of October 2010, the album had been in the top forty in the United Kingdom for sixty-five consecutive weeks, making it one of the best-selling albums of 2009 and 2010. The group's second studio album, Ceremonials, released in October 2011, entered the charts at number one in the UK and number six in the US. The band's third album, How Big, How Blue, How Beautiful, was released on 2 June 2015. It topped the UK charts, and debuted at number one on the US Billboard 200, their first to do so. The album reached number one in a total of eight countries and the top ten of twenty.

	dbo:abstract	"LCD Soundsystem is an American rock band from Brooklyn, New York. Formed in 2002, it is fronted by musician James Murphy, co-founder of DFA Records, the record label the band are signed to (alongside Columbia Records). The band began by recording and releasing multiple singles from 2002 to 2004 leading up to their eponymous debut studio album, which was released in 2005. It garnered critical acclaim as well as a Grammy nomination for Best Electronic/Dance Album. Their single \"Daft Punk Is Playing at My House\", which has become the band's most successful single, also received a Grammy nomination for Best Dance Recording. In the following year, LCD Soundsystem recorded and released \"45:33\", a forty-six minute-long composition that was made as a \"workout track\" especially for Nike as part of their Nike+ Original Run series. In 2007, the band released their second studio album, Sound of Silver, to critical acclaim and another Grammy nomination for Best Electronic/Dance Album. Three years later, LCD Soundsystem released their third studio album, This Is Happening, which became their first top-ten album in their home country of the United States. In February 2011, a statement was posted on the band's website that announced its disbandment. It was to be made official following a large farewell concert at Madison Square Garden on April 2, 2011. The farewell concert is chronicled in the documentary film Shut Up and Play the Hits and was also made available as a live album, titled The Long Goodbye, in April 2014. After a series of rumors hinting at a possible band reunion, LCD Soundsystem released the single \"Christmas Will Break Your Heart\" in December 2015, making it their first single in five years. LCD Soundsystem later confirmed their reunion and announced an expanded tour, including appearances at several high-profile music festivals, as well as a new studio album, which will be released in either 2016 or 2017."@en ;

The band consists of Emily Haines (lead vocals, synthesizers, guitar, tambourine, harmonica, piano), James Shaw (guitar, synthesizers, theremin, backing vocals), Joshua Winstead (bass, synthesizers, backing vocals) and Joules Scott-Key (drums, percussion). Although the band is Canadian, Haines was born in India and Winstead is American. The band started in 1998 as a duo formed by Haines and Shaw with the name \"Mainstream\". After releasing an EP titled Mainstream EP, they changed the band's name to Metric, after a sound that was programmed by Shaw on his keyboard. In 2001, Winstead and Scott-Key joined them. The band's first official studio album, Old World Underground, Where Are You Now?, was released on September 2, 2003. It was followed by the album Live It Out, released on October 4, 2005, which was nominated for the 2006 Polaris Music Prize for the \"Canadian Album of the Year\" and for the 2006 Juno Awards for \"Best Alternative Album\". Their third studio album, Grow Up and Blow Away, was recorded in 2001 and it was initially planned as their debut album. The album was delayed for many years and it was finally released on June 26, 2007, with some changes to the track list. Some songs were also slightly reworked. Metric's fourth album Fantasies was released on April 7, 2009. It was shortlisted for the 2009 Polaris Music Prize for \"Canadian Album of the Year\", and won the \"Alternative Album of the Year\" at the 2010 Juno Awards. Metric also won the 2010 \"Group of the Year\". The fifth Metric studio album, Synthetica, was released on June 12, 2012. The band won two awards at 2013 Juno Awards: \"Alternative Album of the Year\" for Synthetica and \"Producer of the Year\" for James Shaw. The art director/designer/photographer Justin Broadbent also won an award for \"Recording Package of the Year\" for Synthetica.

	dbo:abstract	"Ministry is an American industrial metal band founded by lead singer and only original member Al Jourgensen in 1981. Originally a new wave synthpop outfit, Ministry changed its style to become one of the pioneers of industrial metal in the mid-1980s. Ministry found mainstream success in the early 1990s with their fifth studio album Psalm 69: The Way to Succeed and the Way to Suck Eggs (1992) and touring as part of the Lollapalooza festival. After 27 years of performing, Jourgensen decided to end the band in 2008, saying a reunion would never happen. However, in August 2011, a reunion was announced, when Ministry confirmed they would play one of their first shows in four years at the Wacken Open Air festival in August 2012. Ministry released a new album, Relapse, on March 23, 2012, which was followed by a world tour. Following the death of long time guitarist Mike Scaccia, Ministry released their most recent studio album From Beer to Eternity in September 2013, and subsequently began to tour again with new guitarist Cesar Soto."@en ;
