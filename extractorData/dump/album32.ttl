dbr:Music_of_the_Mana_series	dbo:abstract	"The Mana series, known in Japan as Seiken Densetsu (\u8056\u5263\u4F1D\u8AAC, lit. \"Holy Sword Legend\"), is a role-playing video game series from Square Enix, created by Koichi Ishii. The series began as a handheld side story to Square's flagship franchise Final Fantasy, although most Final Fantasy-inspired elements were subsequently dropped, starting with the second installment, Secret of Mana. It has since grown to include games of various genres within the fictional world of Mana. The music of the Mana series includes soundtracks and arranged albums of music from the series, which is currently composed of Final Fantasy Adventure and its remake Sword of Mana, Secret of Mana, Seiken Densetsu 3, Legend of Mana, Dawn of Mana, Children of Mana, Friends of Mana, Heroes of Mana, Circle of Mana, and Rise of Mana. Each game except for Friends and Circle has produced a soundtrack album, while Adventure has sparked an arranged album as well as a combined soundtrack and arranged album, Legend of Mana has an additional promotional EP, and music from Secret and Seiken Densetsu 3 were combined together into an arranged album. For the series' 20th anniversary, a 20-disc box set of previously-released albums was produced, as well as an album of arrangements by Kenji Ito, composer for several games in the series. The music of Final Fantasy Adventure was composed by Kenji Ito, while Hiroki Kikuta composed Secret of Mana and Seiken Densetsu 3 and Yoko Shimomura wrote the score to Legend of Mana. The music of the World of Mana subseries, composed of Children, Dawn, Friends, and Heroes of Mana, was composed by many different composers, with Ito, Kikuta, Shimomura, Tsuyoshi Sekito, Masayoshi Soken, and Ryuichi Sakamoto composing Dawn, Ito, Masaharu Iwata, and Takayuki Aihara writing Children, and Shimomura composing the music of Friends and Heroes. Rise of Mana was composed by an ensemble group including Ito, Kikuta, Shimomura, Sekito, Yasuhiro Yamanaka, and Kokia. Music from the series has been performed in live concerts such as the Orchestral Game Concerts and the Symphonic Game Music Concerts, and made up one fourth of the Symphonic Fantasies concert in Cologne, Germany. Music from the Mana series has also been arranged for the piano and published as sheet music books."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Suite XVI is the sixteenth studio album by The Stranglers, and saw the band return as a four piece after the departure of Paul Roberts. Lead vocals are shared between guitarist Baz Warne and bassist Jean-Jacques Burnel. The album was released on 18 September 2006 and was supported by an extensive UK tour by the band. The album peaked at number 89 in the UK Albums Chart. The album continues, but also builds on, the shift to a more recognisable sound seen in the previous album, Norfolk Coast with a sound much more akin to the band's earlier sound during the 1970s and early 1980s.[citation needed] Tracks range from the aggression of \"Summat Outanowt\", through the catchy \"She's Slipping Away\" to the machine-gun punk delivery of \"A Soldier's Diary\" (which, according to drummer Jet Black, is the fastest track yet recorded by the band) and back to the melodic ballad of \"Bless You (Save You, Spare You, Damn You)\". There's a foray into country with the biting \"I Hate You\" and the album finishes off with \"Relentless\" \u2014 a sonically relentless exploration of the passing of time. \"See Me Coming\" was originally recorded by Jean-Jacques Burnel for the Japanese animated TV series Gankutsuou.[citation needed] The album was released in Japan with two bonus tracks (taken from the B-side of the UK Single \"Spectre of Love\")."@en ;

This album has them gravitating more towards thrash metal, which has often been cited as the Kokko brothers' primary musical influence. The vocals have changed to lower death vocals, compared to their higher pitched growls in previous albums. The instrumental \"Svieri Doroga\" is a combination of the name of their first demo Svieri Obraza and a track on that demo entitled \"Vezi Doroga\". The name of the title track and album comes from a song originally recorded ten years earlier when the band was still named \"Ancestor\". The video for \"The Groan of Wind\" shows the band members playing inside a cave, with alternating shots of a young boy and girl running from their possessed family members. They are later rescued by a disfigured old man, the Swamplord (Odin), whose picture is on the cover of the album. The album ranked in the top three melodic death metal/Gothenburg albums in 2006.

	dbo:abstract	"Winter in the Belly of a Snake is a 2002 album by Canadian breakcore artist Venetian Snares, released on Planet Mu. The album is generally categorised as glitchcore or breakcore due to the complicated drum patterns, often consisting of only short \"clicks and cuts\" and resonant squeaks, squelches, and buzzes but mostly also with a distorted bass drum. Some short tracks have no such drum patterns and are better described as ambient industrial or subtler kinds of noise. A few pieces contain vocals, some of which\u2014such as the opener \"Dad\"\u2014feature vocals from Funk himself, also most prominently in \"She\", which was written by Misfits and Danzig singer Glenn Danzig, and the track \"Frauj\u00E4ger\" (German, meaning \"Woman Hunter\") which contains heavily distorted vocals by Aiwaz. Also, the track \"January\" samples popular American storyteller Garrison Keillor saying \"It's January\" and \"I realized that if my body broke, I would break into blossom\". The cover art is by the British artist Trevor Brown. Winter in the Belly of a Snake was described as \"a masterpiece of brutally-calculated drill & bass programming combined with ill, Clive-Barker-esque atmospherics and quirky, twisted melodies.\""@en ;

It was released on July 11, 2006 by Red House Records and debuted at number one on the Folk Music Radio Airplay Chart. One departure from previous recordings is the inclusion of a couple of cover songs that blend nicely with Gorka's own compositions. Gorka received some encouragement from Nanci Griffith to record Townes Van Zandt's \"Snow Don't Fall\", and pays tribute to a personal hero by covering Stan Rogers' \"Lockkeeper\". Gorka also shares writing credit with his wife, Laurie Allman, on several tracks. Many of Gorka's past collaborators also return to perform here. Nanci Griffith, Lucy Kaplansky, and Alice Peacock each lend their voices to various tracks. Meanwhile distinctive fretless bass player Michael Manring and multi-instrumentalist John Jennings also contribute their skills. The album made a number of \"best of 2006\" lists and was nominated as a \"Contemporary Release of the Year\" by the North American Folk Music & Dance Alliance (an award that was given to the Wailin' Jennys for the album, Firecracker).

	dbo:abstract	"Blue Afternoon, released in 1969, was Tim Buckley's first self-produced record and his debut for Herb Cohen and Frank Zappa's Straight record label. This was Buckley's fourth album after Tim Buckley, Goodbye and Hello, and Happy Sad. Blue Afternoon used the same group of musicians as Happy Sad, with the inclusion of drummer Jimmy Madison. Several tracks on Blue Afternoon are songs Buckley had intended to record on earlier albums but had not completed. \"Chase the Blues Away\" and \"Happy Time\" are numbers he had worked on in the summer of 1968 for possible inclusion on Happy Sad and demos can be heard on the Rhino label's Works in Progress album. On Blue Afternoon, Buckley takes the folk song as his starting point and expands it, drawing on jazz influences to create new dynamics and to emphasize atmosphere and mood. This approach can perhaps be best appreciated on the mournful track \"The River\".[opinion] During the same four weeks in which he recorded Blue Afternoon, he also recorded its follow-up, Lorca, and material for Starsailor. Blue Afternoon, like Starsailor, was re-released on CD format only once in the United States, in 1989 on the Enigma Retro label. It was later re-issued by Warners/Rhino Records UK in 2011 as part of the 'Original Album Series' box set, with Buckley's four LPs released on Elektra Records. In late 2005, the album was made available on the iTunes Store."@en ;

The record was made by hand-cutting vinyl records onto an eight-track recorder without computer splicing or samplers. The album took Eric San 4 years to record, more than the 6 months he originally told Ninja Tunes it would take. The album was issued with a comic book drawn by Eric San himself. It detailed a DJ captured by a corporation, shrunken down to 1/10 his original size, and placed in a box of fictional Disco -o- Flakes cereal. He breaks out of the box four years later and struggles to become a DJ. The CD is enhanced with a video game modeled on Asteroids called \"Vinoids,\" in which you have to destroy radioactive records before they reach Earth.

dbr:Here_You_Come_Again	rdf:type	schema:MusicAlbum ;
	dbo:abstract	"Here You Come Again, released in 1977, is the 19th solo studio album by Dolly Parton. The album included Parton's first significant \"crossover\" success, the Grammy award-winning title single, which scored #3 on the US pop singles charts during the early months of 1978. Both the album and title single also scored #1 on the US country music albums and singles charts respectively. \"Here You Come Again\"' was a rare example of a Parton success that she did not write herself; it was composed by the songwriting team of Barry Mann and Cynthia Weil. In addition to four of Parton's own compositions, the album also included work by Bobby Goldsboro, John Sebastian, and Kenny Rogers. In addition to the title single, Parton's composition \"Two Doors Down\" also scored on both the US pop and country music charts. After the success of the title track on the pop charts, Parton rerecorded \"Two Doors Down\" in a more laid back, pop style several months after the album's release, releasing the new version as a single, and also having it replace the original version of the song on subsequent pressings of the album. The single version of \"Two Doors Down\" was released along with \"It's All Wrong, but It's All Right\" as a double-A-sided single in April 1978, scoring #1 on the U.S. country singles charts, and scoring the top twenty on the U.S. pop music charts. The song had also been a top-ten country music success for newcomer Zella Lehr earlier during 1978. Initial reaction to Here You Come Again was mixed, with many critics and fans disliking the more \"produced\" sound of the album, though it proved to be Parton's first album to be certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America, for shipping a million copies. The album stayed at #1 on the Billboard Top Country Albums chart for nine consecutive weeks. It stayed in the Top Ten for 35 weeks. The album's vivid, color-saturated cover was designed by graphic artist Ed Caraeff, who would also create covers for Parton's next two albums. The distinctive \"Dolly\" signature logo, created by Michael Manoogian, would become Parton's de facto logo, appearing on all of her solo albums for the remainder of her association with RCA, as well as much of her promotional material. After being out of print on CD since a very limited run in 1998, the album was finally released for digital download on 4 December 2015."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Mes Courants \u00C9lectriques (English: My Electric Currents) is the second studio album by the French singer Aliz\u00E9e. It was released on 18 March 2003. Though not as successful as her previous album, Gourmandises, this album still sold more than 400,000 copies in the first three months of its release. Unlike her previous album, which was entirely in French, this album has English versions of four of its songs. As with Aliz\u00E9e's first album, the entire production was the work of Myl\u00E8ne Farmer (Lyrics) and Laurent Boutonnat (Music), but this would be the pair's last work with Aliz\u00E9e. Unlike Aliz\u00E9e's earlier album, this album was customised for different markets, with slightly different contents. The French version did not contain any English versions of any of the tracks, whereas the international version included four English language renditions. The Japan version refers to \"J'en ai marre !\" as \"Mon bain de mousse\". In Taiwan and Hong Kong, and other traditional Chinese spoken parts of Asia, this album was launched as a 2-CD set, along with an Enhanced CD, not playable on DVD/VCD players, featuring videos of \"Moi... Lolita\" and \"I'm Fed Up !\". Following Aliz\u00E9e's decline in popularity in the past few years, the physical version of the album is now out of print, with new unused copies retailing at around 40 Euros from online marketplace sellers."@en ;

Receiving mixed reviews the album was originally released as an LP and a cassette in May 1984 before it was reissued on CD in August. The album was reissued on CD in 2003, along with the other four of the band's first five studio albums, having been remastered and expanded before again being reissued in 2008 with a live bonus disc.

It was released on Action Records in the United Kingdom in 2003, and then on Narnack Records in the United States, with a slightly altered tracklisting, in 2004. The subtitle is explained by the fact that the tracks were originally scheduled for release under the title Country on the Click. The tracks were recorded between December 2002 and January 2003, and mixed, by Grant Showbiz and Jim Watts, in February 2003. Promos were sent out and three of the new songs were previewed in the band's 23rd Peel Session, recorded 19 February and broadcast 13 March 2003. The release was delayed after a mix appeared on the internet, prompting Mark E. Smith to remix, partially re-record, re-sequence and rename the album. However, the original title still appears on the CD spine. The album features the song \"Theme from Sparta F.C.\", which, since 2005, has been used as the theme music to the Final Score section of BBC television's Saturday afternoon sports coverage. In 2006, Smith was also invited to read out the classified football results on the BBCi interactive service \"Score\"; this performance was in turn released by the Sonic Arts Network on their Stewart Lee-compiled album The Topography of Chance. An alternative version of the tune, \"Theme from Sparta F.C. #2\", was released as a UK single in 2004, and this version also appears on the US versions of the album.

It was released on November 17, 1998 on 550 Records (with distribution from Sony Records). At some stores, a limited edition 12\" vinyl single for \"In Love\" was bundled for free with Volume 1. It featured a remix of the song by Thievery Corporation, as well as a couple of cuts off of the album. Although Folds, Southern and Painter were the primary contributors to the records, a large cast of other musicians were included as well. William Shatner provided vocals on \"In Love\" (as well as the reprise, \"Still in Love\"). Painter's wife, Fleming McWilliams, sang on several tracks. Frally Hynes, Folds' Australian then-girlfriend (and wife from 1999 to 2007) performed frantic lead vocals on \"Root to This\" (\"root\" being a crude Australian slang term for sexual intercourse). Folds sang on a number of songs as well. The track \"Rubber Sled\" is a humorous reference to Ben Folds Five bass player Robert Sledge. A clip of Brick by Ben Folds Five is playing in the background at the beginning of this song, though played at twice its normal speed, and a sample of Folds yelling \"Robert Sledge on the bass guitar!\" can be heard approximately halfway through the song. \"I Paid My Money\" was at least almost a decade old at the time it was recorded in 1998. The original 1990 demo version featured Folds singing over an African-American choir. Audio Antihero founder Jamie Halliday named \"In Love\" by Fear of Pop and William Shatner as his \"favourite song of all time.\""@en ;

A second single \"We Are One Tonight\" was released in early 2006, but without much success on the Billboard charts. The album was marred by major controversy over the inclusion of XCP copy protection distributed on all copies of the disc. This led to bassist Tim Foreman posting a detailed work-around on the band's website (which was promptly removed by Columbia Records). Nothing Is Sound was at the forefront of the Sony BMG CD copy prevention scandal, which eventually led to the recall of all CDs that contained the protection."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Take This to Your Grave is the debut studio album by American rock band Fall Out Boy. It was released on May 6, 2003, by Fueled by Ramen. The album was produced by Sean O'Keefe. When the band was signed to Island Records, Island employed an unusual strategy that allowed the band to sign with independent label Fueled by Ramen for their debut, to later move to the major label for a second album. O'Keefe had helped with the band's demo, and the group returned to Smart Studios in Madison, Wisconsin to record the bulk of their first album. Living on a stranger's floor for part of the time and running out of money halfway through, the band recorded seven songs in nine days, bringing them together with the additional three from the demo. While Stump had previously written all prior lyrics and took them lightly, Wentz took the process with a considerable seriousness and obsessively picked apart his bandmates' lyrics. The \"exhausting\" process led to numerous revisions of single songs and several arguments. The album cover, which features all four bandmates sitting on a broken futon, features a blue tint reminiscent of jazz records and was the second choice after the original was rejected by the label. The album created gradual interest in the band as they toured across the country, including a five-day stint on Warped Tour 2004. The album was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), with sales of 634,000 copies, as of August 2008. The record produced three singles, including the minor success \"Grand Theft Autumn/Where Is Your Boy\". The album has often been named as a vital blueprint for pop punk music, with Alternative Press calling the record a \"subcultural touchstone [...] a magical, transcendent and deceptively smart pop-punk masterpiece that ushered in a vibrant scene resurgence with a potent combination of charisma, new media marketing and hardcore-punk urgency.\""@en ;

The performance included here is from the opening night of his tour at the Casino Rama, just outside Toronto, Ontario in Canada. Despite this, the CD booklet for Tour 2003 confusingly carries a review for a later August show in Detroit. As ever, the line-up of Starr's celebrity companions has changed once again. Bandleader Mark Rivera remains, as does singing percussionist Sheila E. New to the mix are Paul Carrack of Squeeze and Mike + The Mechanics fame, Colin Hay from Australian band Men at Work and John Waite, a solo artist who also had fronted The Babys and Bad English. Having already exhausted the appearances of most of his 1960s and 1970s contemporaries, Starr's new participants clearly add a strong 1980s element to Tour 2003, giving this recording a different edge. While Starr typically performs his well-known hits from his heyday, he does venture here to include \"Memphis In Your Mind\" from Ringo Rama. Some critics were quick to note that this live album was Starr's seventh official release of the sort in fourteen years. Tour 2003 generally received lackluster reviews upon release.

The album marks the only appearance of bassist Gavin Fox, following the departure of Bob Fairfoull in 2002, and is the first album to feature touring guitarist Allan Stewart as a permanent member. During the recording of the album, Roddy Woomble described the process as feeling \"so different, in every way, than any of our other records,\" and cited that Idlewild felt like a \"new band\". The album is a departure from the sound of their earlier material, blending contemporary folk influences with melodic rock. Mike Diver, from Drowned in Sound, described the album as \"the opinion-splitter in Idlewild\u2019s canon of work. It marked the final chapter in the group\u2019s relationship with Parlophone.\" Guitarist Rod Jones, stated that the album is \"more stripped back and direct\" than previous albums, and that it has a sense of \"frailty\" to it, while drummer, Colin Newton, noted that the album is \"not an immediate sounding record; in fact I can imagine it being quite difficult to get into at first. I think it fits together quite well, but there isn\u2019t anything that\u2019s instantly catchy like \"When I Argue I See Shapes\" or \"You Held the World in Your Arms\". Lyrically, Woomble describes the album as sounding like \"a series of public service announcements.\" Woomble credited Jones with influencing the sound of the band's previous album, The Remote Part, but noted that Warnings/Promises \"had more of my influence on it, bringing it into roots and folksy territories.\" The album entered the UK Album Chart at #9, and is currently certified as Silver in the UK, having sold over 60,000 copies. It was performed in full on 20 December 2008, at King Tut's Wah Wah Hut. The track 'Too Long Awake' features on the video game, Saints Row."@en ;

The band asked Atco for time to re-record the album, but the label, not wanting to miss the Christmas holiday season, insisted that the record be released as it was. However, the label did give Stills and Young permission to personally mix the mono version of the LP themselves, and the Buffalo Springfield have long insisted that their mono version was superior to the stereo version.[citation needed]"@en ;

Jeremy Spencer did not feature on the album apart from \"a couple of piano things\" (according to Mick Fleetwood in Q magazine in 1990). The record, appearing after the group's sudden success in the pop charts, offered a broader stylistic range than the classic blues of the group's first two albums. The title is taken from Duke Orsino's opening line, \"If music be the food of love, then play on,\" from William Shakespeare's comedy play Twelfth night. This was the band's first release with Warner/Reprise after being lured away from Blue Horizon and a one-off with Immediate Records. Forty years on, Fleetwood Mac remain with Warner. The album, which at its original UK release had an unusually long running time, has been released with four different song line-ups. The original CD compiled all songs from the two US LP versions, both of which omitted tracks from the original UK version. In August 2013, a remastered edition of the album was reissued on vinyl and CD, restoring its original 1969 UK track listing. This version reached No. 112 on the UK Albums chart."@en ;

On the seal, the album title is misnamed as A Little South of Insanity. There are no listings to support where or when each performance was culled from - only the listing that all tracks are from either the Get A Grip or Nine Lives World Tours. However, during the track \"Sweet Emotion\" (on disc 2), Tyler shouts out \"Seattle\", and in \"Falling in Love (Is Hard on the Knees)\" (on disc 1) he says \"Ohhhh, West Palm Beach!\" A bootleg called Yokohama Arena 3/12/98 has \"Last Child\" being recorded at the same time as the title revealed to where the song was performed, also, Tyler says, \"Motherfucker\" out loud as if it were edited in this live album. Eat the Rich is recorded from Costa Rica on November, 1994. At the beginning of disc 2, before starting \"Back in the Saddle\", Tyler shouts, \"I've got blisters on my sisters!\", referencing a similar thing Ringo Starr shouted at the end of The Beatles song \"Helter Skelter\"."@en ;

The album was re-released by Epitaph Records on September 15, 2008. The lyrical content can also be seen as a departure for Graffin. In most Bad Religion songs, he deals with subjects such as mass globalisation or world pollution.

It was a huge international success for the band, as it spent 3 weeks at number 1 position in the U.S. album charts and many weeks in the top 10 album charts of The Billboard 200, the UK and New Zealand. It sold 4 million copies in 2001. The album was certified 5x platinum by the RIAA. A total of 5 singles were released from this album, \"It's Been Awhile\", \"Fade\", \"Outside\", \"For You\" and \"Epiphany\", all of which did reasonably well. There were videos made for each of these songs (some of which can be found on Staind's MTV Unplugged DVD). The first four singles had varying degrees of success in the UK, \"It's Been Awhile\" charting the highest of the four released in both countries. The album also includes a track called \"Waste\" dedicated to two teenage fans who committed suicide. Like Staind's previous album Dysfunction, Break The Cycle is a nu metal and alternative metal album.

Its music incorporates a range of contemporary genres with a mix of slow ballads and dance tracks. Originally, Carey wrote four songs with Ben Margulies, which solely constituted her demo tape. While altered and partially re-sung after being signed to Columbia, all four songs made the final cut for the album. Aside from Margulies, Carey worked with a range of professional writers and producers, all of whom were hired by Columbia CEO, Tommy Mottola. Mariah Carey featured production and writing from Rhett Lawrence, Ric Wake and Narada Michael Walden, all of whom were top record producers at the time. Together with Carey, they conceived the album and reconstructed her original demo tape. Upon release, the album received generally positive reviews from music critics, who complimented Carey's voice and technique, as well as the album's content. It became a commercial success as well, topping the Billboard 200 album chart for eleven consecutive weeks. Mariah Carey was certified nine-times platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), denoting shipments of nine million copies in the United States. The album experienced similar success in Canada, where it topped the charts and was certified seven-times platinum. Mariah Carey fared well in other worldwide territories, reaching the top ten in the Netherlands, Australia, New Zealand, Norway, Sweden and United Kingdom. Worldwide, the album has sold 15 million copies. Five singles were released from the album, four of which became number-one hits on the Hot 100. \"Vision of Love\" was chosen as the album's lead single, topping the charts in Canada, New Zealand, and the United States. The song was critically lauded, and was regarded as one of the strongest debut singles by a female singer. The album's second single, \"Love Takes Time\" was also well received and peaked the charts in Canada and the US. With the following two singles, \"Someday\" and \"I Don't Wanna Cry\" reaching number one in the US, Carey became the first artist since The Jackson 5 to have their first four singles top the charts in the United States."@en ;

It was also their only release on Fat Wreck Chords. It is first Rancid release with four members, with the inclusion of Lars Fredriksen on guitar and vocals. Previously a three-piece, Rancid was in need of a second guitar player to refine their sound. They had briefly performed live with Billie Joe Armstrong of Green Day as their second guitar player, but Billie Joe decided to stay with Green Day rather than become a full member of Rancid. \"Radio\" was written in the short time that Billie Joe was in the band, and he therefore was a co-writer of the song. After Billie Joe decided to leave, Frederiksen filled the spot. Frederiksen had previously been a member of the British punk rock band the UK Subs. \"Radio\" and \"Dope Sick Girl\" were both re-recorded for the band's second album, Let's Go, which was released the next year. The versions on the EP, \"Radio\" in particular, are arranged differently than the versions on Let's Go. Fat Wreck Chords reissued the EP on January 15, 2009, on white vinyl."@en ;

The album was Cold's most commercially successful, debuting at #3 on the Billboard album charts, with over 101,000 copies sold in its first week. Early pressings of Year of the Spider were shipped with a DVD and a temporary tattoo of the Cold spider logo. The DVD included the making of the (as well as the actual) video for \"Stupid Girl\", fan testimonials, and some home video shot during the recording of the album. This is also the last album with guitarists Terry Balsamo and Kelly Hayes. A year prior to the album's release, the mellow ballad \"Gone Away\" was released on the WWE Tough Enough 2 soundtrack. Its music video, which met with considerable airplay upon release, listed it as from the album Year of the Spider despite the long wait for its release. \"Gone Away\" was subsequently used as a hidden track; the song begins at 16:06 after 13 minutes and 13 seconds of silence (a reference to the superstitious nature of the band's previous effort 13 Ways to Bleed on Stage). The album was frequently postponed from its projected release date. As early as April 2002, Year of the Spider was scheduled by Geffen for an October 2002 release.

	dbo:abstract	"Hellbilly Deluxe (released with the subtitle 13 Tales of Cadaverous Cavorting Inside the Spookshow International) is the solo debut studio album by American musician and filmmaker Rob Zombie. The album serves as his first release outside out the band White Zombie, with whom he released two multi-platinum studio albums. Hellbilly Deluxe was released on August 25, 1998 through Geffen Records. Musically, the project portrays Zombie's love for classic horror films with heavy metal and electronic music. The album's lyrics speak of murder, chaos, and supernatural forces. The majority of Hellbilly Deluxe was recorded in California, and was produced by both Zombie and Scott Humphrey; Zombie is credited as the sole writer on all of the songs. Hellbilly Deluxe was released to a generally positive critical reception, with the album's production being praised. The album proved to be a commercial success, reaching the top five of the Billboard 200 and selling over three million copies in the United States. Hellbilly Deluxe outsold all of Zombie's releases with his former band, and established him as a successful solo artist. The project appeared on multiple charts worldwide, though failed to duplicate the success it had in North America. Since its release, the album has garnered the title of a \"shock rock classic\" by numerous publications. The album was preceded by the release of Zombie's debut single, \"Dragula\". The song was a hit in the United States, and appeared on the singles chart in the United Kingdom. \"Living Dead Girl\" was released as the album's second single, and achieved a similar amount of success as its predecessor. The album's third and final single was \"Superbeast\", which failed to emulate the commercial performance of the album's first two singles. All three of the song were used extensively in the media, appearing in various films and video games. \"Dragula\" is often referred to as Zombie's signature song, and remains his highest selling single worldwide. Hellbilly Deluxe is Zombie's most successful album to date."@en ;

dbr:Reconstruction_Site	rdf:type	schema:MusicAlbum ;
	dbo:abstract	"Reconstruction Site is a 2003 album by The Weakerthans. A song cycle about grief, regret, loss and eventual hope, the album is thematically framed by three tracks, \"(Manifest)\", \"(Hospital Vespers)\" and \"(Past-Due)\", which set three different sonnets following a terminally ill hospital patient into the aftermath of his death to the same melody. Other songs examine the album's themes from different angles: \"Plea from a Cat Named Virtute\" is written from the perspective of a depressed person's cat, \"One Great City!\" is about Samson's love\u2013hate relationship with his hometown of Winnipeg, and \"Our Retired Explorer\" imagines a dinner date between philosopher Michel Foucault and a hopelessly nostalgic member of Ernest Shackleton's expedition to Antarctica. Guest musicians on the album include Sarah Harmer and Christine Fellows. The album's cover art was designed by Canadian artist and fellow Winnipegger Marcel Dzama. The song \"One Great City!\" serves as the theme song to the Canadian television comedy-drama series Less Than Kind. In 2013, the album made Ballast's list of top 50 Canadian albums of all time."@en ;

It was recorded with a 21-piece orchestra and released in 1996. It has a slower and quieter sound than Sunny Day Real Estate's often-bombastic albums. The album was recorded after Enigk converted to Christianity; this conversion had been originally thought to have brought on the disbanding of Sunny Day Real Estate, which was later cleared up as a smaller part of more internal struggles in the band. Sunny Day Real Estate reunited in 1997, when they released How It Feels to Be Something On. The sound of that record furthers the mellower sound developed on Return of the Frog Queen. According to the 1997 Sub Pop mail-order catalog, Lou Barlow, of fellow Sub Pop band Sebadoh, cited Frog Queen as his favorite album of 1996."@en ;

Released separately in May 1981 on Barking Pumpkin Records, it was subsequently reissued as a triple album box set in 1982. As the title implies, the album consists solely of instrumentals and improvised solos, largely performed on electric guitar. The album series was conceived after Zappa shelved a proposed live album, Warts and All, and two tracks intended for that album appear on this series. The individual Shut Up 'n Play Yer Guitar albums and box set have been well received by critics, and Zappa subsequently produced two more albums focusing solely on guitar-oriented music: Guitar (1988) and Trance-Fusion (posthumously released in 2006).

dbr:Thing-Fish	rdf:type	schema:MusicAlbum ;
	dbo:abstract	"Thing-Fish is an album by Frank Zappa, originally released as a triple album box set on Barking Pumpkin Records in 1984. It was billed as a cast recording for a proposed musical of the same name, which was ultimately not produced by Zappa, but later performed in 2003, ten years after his death. The album's storyline is inspired by Broadway theatre, AIDS, eugenics, conspiracy theories, feminism, homosexuality and African American culture. It involves an evil, racist prince/theater critic who creates a disease intended to eradicate African Americans and homosexuals. The disease is tested on prisoners who are turned into \"Mammy Nuns\" led by the story's narrator, Thing-Fish. The story within a story is a satire of a White Anglo-Saxon Protestant couple, Harry and Rhonda (actually played by Italian-Americans), who attend a play performed by the \"Mammy Nuns\", and find themselves confronted with their pasts: Harry presented as a homosexual boy, Rhonda presented as a sex doll brought to life. The story was constructed during the recording sessions, which included producing new overdubs for recordings which previously appeared on Zappa's albums Zoot Allures, Tinseltown Rebellion, You Are What You Is and Ship Arriving Too Late to Save a Drowning Witch. The release of the album was delayed when Barking Pumpkin Records' previous distributor, MCA, refused to distribute the album. It was instead released by Capitol Records in the United States, accompanied by a \"Warning/Guarantee\" written by Zappa himself. Thing-Fish was initially received poorly by critics, who criticized the use of previously recorded material, but has since been reappraised for its highly satirical content. This is Official Release #41."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Welcome Back, My Friends, to the Show That Never Ends... Ladies and Gentlemen, Emerson, Lake & Palmer is a 1974 live album by progressive rock band Emerson, Lake & Palmer. It was originally packaged as a three-disk vinyl set in a gatefold (\"trifold\" with two sections opening away from the centre) cover, the inside of which used the letters \"E\", \"L\" and \"P\" as retainers for the individual disks. The album reached No. 4 on the Billboard album chart, making it ELP's highest charting album in the US. This was the last ELP release for almost three years while the band took an extended break to recover and pursue some solo projects that eventually ended up on their next release Works in 1977. The album was recorded during the 1973/1974 Someone Get Me a Ladder world tour. The title of the album comes from the introduction to the performance, itself a paraphrase of the opening line of the song \"Karn Evil 9: First Impression, Part 2\". The \"welcome back my friends\" hook was also used by Alan Freeman on some of his radio shows. The Quadraphonic mix of the album was only released in the Quadraphonic 8-track cartridge format, as a three-tape set. Despite the tape cartridge box art sharing the Quadradisc record logo, a planned CD-4 quad vinyl version of the 3 record set had to be scrapped, due to engineering issues with master tapes that prevented JVC from cutting a stable master to meet strict CD-4 format specifications. Most of the original recordings included on the album had been first issued as a presentation for the syndicated US radio show \"King Biscuit Flower Hour\".

	dbo:abstract	"Karen Carpenter is the only solo project by singer/drummer Karen Carpenter, released on CD by A&M Records in 1996. The album was recorded in New York with producer Phil Ramone in 1979 and 1980, during the time that her brother Richard was being treated for an addiction to Quaaludes. Some of the songs from the album were later featured on The Carpenters' 1989 compilation Lovelines and later releases. In the liner notes, Karen dedicated the project to her brother \"To Richard, with all my heart.\".[discuss] The liner notes, including comments from Richard Carpenter and producer Phil Ramone, include Richard's explanation for shelving the album in 1981, and his later decision to release it as Karen approved it. Karen was backed by various New York and Los Angeles studio musicians, including Steve Gadd, Greg Phillinganes, Louis Johnson and members of Billy Joel's band. A&M executives in New York approved of the material, but the executives in Los Angeles, including Herb Alpert and Jerry Moss, responded negatively. Ramone recalls that Karen broke down in tears. Devastated, she accepted A&M's urging not to release the album. Richard dismisses the reports that he put the stake through it and their mother Agnes disapproved as \"all poppycock\" and says that the decision was up to Karen, who respected the opinions of her elders and she finally decided that it wasn't being released. An episode of E! True Hollywood Story claims that Herb Alpert called the album \"unreleaseable\". Quincy Jones championed releasing the album to Derek Green, an A&M Records vice-president, but Alpert, Green and Moss insisted the album had to be cancelled. The production of the album cost $400,000 of Karen's own money and $100,000 fronted by A&M Records. The $100,000 fronted by A&M was offset against Carpenters' future album royalties. On February 3, 1983, the day before Karen's death, she called Ramone to discuss the album; according to Ramone, Karen said, \"I hope you don't mind if I curse. I still love our fucking record!\" It remained shelved until 1996 \u2014 thirteen years after Karen's death. The songs on the album were mixed according to Karen's instructions.[citation needed]"@en ;

dbr:Dance_Naked	rdf:type	schema:MusicAlbum ;
	dbo:abstract	"Dance Naked is the 13th album by American singer-songwriter and musician John Mellencamp released in 1994. The album was released in response to the record company's accusations that Mellencamp's previous album, Human Wheels, didn't \"fit the format.\" Mellencamp was irritated with this remark, feeling that none of his albums ever fit the format. As a result, he wrote several purposely radio-friendly songs and recorded them within the span of 14 days at his Belmont Mall recording studio in Belmont, Indiana, intending to show the lack of effort required to produce the type of album they were asking for. Although Mellencamp claims that Dance Naked was merely an easy output to give the company what it wanted, the album was still well received. The most notable accomplishment was the largely successful single \"Wild Night,\" a cover of the 1971 song by Van Morrison. The song featured Me'shell Ndegeocello on a duet with Mellencamp as well as the prominent bass lead. The single reached #3 on the Billboard Hot 100 and charted at #1 on the Adult Contemporary List for 8 weeks. The album itself reached #13 on the Billboard 200 and produced several music videos: two versions for \"Wild Night,\" another for the title track \"Dance Naked,\" and two unreleased videos for \"L.U.V.\" and \"Another Sunny Day 12/25.\" Dance Naked was re-mastered and re-released on July 19, 2005, along with three other Mellencamp albums. The re-mastered edition includes an acoustic version of \"Wild Night\" as a bonus track. Spin Magazine named Dance Naked the 20th best album of 1994."@en ;

In 1998, the album was selected as one of The Source's 100 Best Rap Albums.

In the time between the release of this album and their debut, The End of the Ring Wars, the band parted company with drummer Louis Ruiz and introduced Josh \"Cobra\" Baruth, whose very intricate, percussive and expressive drumming is prominent on Mare Vitalis. Along with this new dimension, the group progressed from the angst-ridden, distortion-laden emo-rock of their debut for a far more atmospheric blend of distinctive, repeated guitar arpeggios and found sounds, while each song displayed a mastery of crescendo and a uniformity of atmosphere. Still very much a song-based work, however, it is essentially a concept album on the life and movements of the sea, as the titles of tracks \"Fishing The Sky\" and \"Poseidon\" suggest. The album ends with a lengthy secret track of droning feedback and swirling sounds which foreshadows the experimental post-rock of the Low Level Owl albums released the following year."@en ;

The title track saw a limited release in Italy, when the band visited the country during their tour in March 1983.

So with this album we became more familiar with many more instruments. In our minds we were trying to do for a rock album what Peter Gabriel does to pop by infusing various cultures, percussion and exotic sounds into it.\" The Edges of Twilight helped propel the band into mainstream success in their native Canada, where it reached double platinum status and earned the band several Juno nominations, including \"Best Rock Album\" and \"Group of the Year\". The title of the album is taken from a chapter of the book Fire in the Head, by the American author Tom Cowan, which also inspired the name of the first track on the album. The album includes a hidden song which features a spoken word performance by the folk legend Roy Harper, who is a friend of the band. On the cover is a statue by William Wetmore Story called Angel of Grief. To commemorate the 20th anniversary of The Edges of Twilight, The Tea Party released a deluxe remastered CD, remastered LP, and a North American tour. The deluxe CD also includes a bonus disc that includes alternate, live, radio sessions and bonus audio and the booklet features the story of the album with new band interviews and previously unseen photos. A series of original artworks were commissioned by the band from Australian artist, Robert Buratti which were released worldwide. Buratti also created a series of short films which were projected as a backdrop to the band while performing across Canada and Australia."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Tomcats Screaming Outside is the first solo album from British musician Roland Orzabal of the group Tears for Fears, and was released on 2 April 2001. Although Orzabal had effectively made two solo albums under the Tears for Fears moniker in the 1990s (following the departure of bandmate Curt Smith), this was the first recording to be released under his own name. This album was Orzabal's last to feature contributions from Alan Griffiths, who co-wrote most of the tracks on this album as well as the previous two Tears for Fears albums. The album was given a low-key release and did not chart, but earned some critical acclaim for its clever melding of pop songwriting and drum 'n bass, ambient techno and trip hop textures. Dan Gennoe claimed in Amazon.com's editorial review: \"Solo album or not, Tomcats Screaming Outside is the best Tears for Fears album in a decade.\" In a 2000 interview Orzabal commented on his influences for the album: \"I started out with an absolute concrete vision of where I wanted to go so I started with a very different rhythm approach, with drum and bass/jungle...and I ended up with something that wasn't the original plan.\" The US release of the album (on Gold Circle Records) had the unfortunate coincidence to be released on September 11, 2001 the same day the United States experienced its worst-ever terrorist attack, and drew little notice outside TFF's core fan base."@en ;

dbr:Trio_II	rdf:type	schema:MusicAlbum ;
	dbo:abstract	"Trio II is the second album featuring collaboration between American singer/songwriters Emmylou Harris, Linda Ronstadt, and Dolly Parton. A dozen years after the release of their multi-Platinum, Grammy-winning Trio album, the country music supergroup returned with another in the same vein. Five of the ten tracks on this album first appeared on Linda Ronstadt's 1995 album Feels Like Home. These five tracks were \"Lover's Return\", \"High Sierra\", a cover of Neil Young's \"After the Gold Rush\" (with Valerie Carter and string arrangements by David Campbell), \"The Blue Train\" (a Top 40 solo hit for Ronstadt), and the title song to the Ronstadt album, the Randy Newman-composed \"Feels Like Home\". The album reached the Top Five on Billboard's Country Albums chart as well as #62 on Billboard's main album listing. The songs were actually recorded in 1994 by Parton, Ronstadt and Harris, but label disputes and conflicting schedules of the three women prevented its release at the time. Eventually, Ronstadt remixed the five above-mentioned tracks (sans Parton's vocals) to include in Feels Like Home. In 1999 (after Parton and Harris had parted ways with their respective labels), they decided to finally release the album as originally recorded. Though it yielded no hit singles (mainstream U.S. country radio had long since dropped most artists approaching or over 50 from their playlists by the late 1990s), Trio 2 was certified Gold by the RIAA, and won the trio another Grammy Award in 2000. Childhood photos of Harris, Parton and Ronstadt were used for the album's cover, when a photo shoot proved impossible (due to the three artists' busy schedules), though they did manage to assemble for a short promotional tour in early 1999, and to film a popular music video for \"After the Gold Rush\" which was filmed inside a synagogue in New York City that January. Though scheduling conflicts would not allow for an extended concert tour, the three did do a short promotional tour to support the album, including performances on CBS This Morning, The Tonight Show with Jay Leno, The Today Show, and The Late Show with David Letterman. \"Softly & Tenderly\" was recorded for the album but was cut. It was included on the 2007 Emmylou Harris boxset, Songbird: Rare Tracks and Forgotten Gems."@en ;

It was recorded and produced by the band and Nick Raskulinecz at Studio 606 in Los Angeles, California, and was released on August 1, 2006, through Roadrunner Records. Writing for the album began as early as 2003 when vocalist Corey Taylor and guitarist James Root were writing material for their other band, Slipknot. In January 2006 Stone Sour began recording the follow-up to their 2002 debut album Stone Sour, during which time drummer Joel Ekman left the band due to family constraints. He was eventually replaced by ex-Soulfly drummer Roy Mayorga who played on all but two tracks on the album. Following the release of the album, Stone Sour went on to promote it for over a year; releasing five singles and touring in several regions, including the United States, Canada, Japan and several countries in Europe. The album received generally positive reviews. It was praised for showing a progression in the band's song writing ability and musical style. It was also certified Gold in the United States and Canada and the single \"30/30-150\" was nominated for Best Metal Performance at the 49th Grammy Awards. On June 26, 2007 Stone Sour released a special edition version of the album, it included six previously unreleased tracks and a bonus DVD which featured three music videos and a complete live performance of the band in Moscow. It remains their best-selling album to date, mostly due to the success of the single \"Through Glass.\""@en ;

Fan the Flame (Part 1) contains more mid-tempo songs and melancholy lyrical content. The male background vocals on \"Total Stranger\" were performed by British pop band Londonbeat and the London Community Gospel Choir provided backing vocals for \"Unhappy Birthday\". The songs \"Unhappy Birthday\" and \"Gone 2 Long\" were later re-recorded as uptempo dance tracks for Dead or Alive's next album Nukleopatra. Fan the Flame (Part 2) was recorded but never released, and is often confused with the acoustic album Love Pete, which was made available during a US personal appearance tour in 1992 and has since been widely bootlegged with the title Fan the Flame (Part 2): The Acoustic Sessions.In his autobiography Pete Burns strongly criticizes its subsequent illegal distribution and those fans who continue to buy it.

Honus stated that they desired to acquire a sound that he felt they had lost since before they became Man Man, and said to \"rectify\" this that they went on several Creative Commons websites to find songs they felt had the poignant sting of their proto-sound."@en ;

dbr:Ten_Out_of_10	rdf:type	schema:MusicAlbum ;
	dbo:abstract	"Ten Out of 10 is the eighth studio album by 10cc and was released in 1981. It failed to chart in the US or UK. The album marked the first involvement with the band by American singer-songwriter Andrew Gold, who was also invited to join the band, but declined because of other commitments. Gouldman said the band's label in the U.S., Warner Bros. Records wanted more of an American flavour to the album. \"They were keen for us to work with an American producer or writer. Well, we hadn't had any big success since '78, and we wanted to get hot again. When they suggested Andrew Gold, I was over the moon. I'd always adored his work, and I reckoned he would be a kindred spirit ... I felt really we needed some new blood, but it didn't work out. Andrew was doing so much stuff in America that it just wasn't practical, although he really wanted to do it.\" Gouldman later admitted greater involvement by Gold might have lifted the band's early 1980s output from its mediocrity. \"We should either have tried to change direction, which we didn't, or got someone else in the band, which we almost did. The albums weren't really bad, there was always the integrity, and the production values, but in retrospect, I find them rather dour, rather lacklustre. That's why I thought we should have got someone else in, to kick us up the arse. We didn't see what was going on around us, maybe we should have got a producer at that point.\" Gold was invited to record with the band by Lenny Waronker, head of A&R at Warners. He explained: \"He was of the opinion that, although the album was very strong, it might benefit the US audience to have a few additional cuts tailored more for the American ear. As he knew I was an Anglophile, we might hit it off well.\"Soon I was in the UK, co-writing and co-producing three tracks for the album, which was a blast to do and turned out very well. During the course of my three-week stay, Eric, Graham and I fell in love, as it were, and soon they asked me to join the band, which was an extremely exciting offer. For various reasons, which now seem dumb to me, and after great consideration, I demurred in favour of pursuing my own career and returned to America.\" Although the album featured two of the musicians used on 1980s' Look Hear? \u2013 drummer Paul Burgess on all but two tracks, guitarist and singer Rick Fenn on two tracks \u2013 Ten Out of 10 was clearly a return to the core duo of Graham Gouldman and Eric Stewart. A variety of session musicians, including pianist Vic Emerson of Sad Caf\u00E9, were employed for the album, but unlike its predecessor, they were not acknowledged on the album as part of \"the group\". Instead they were credited by name after the contributions of Gouldman and Stewart, who were identified only as \"Graham\" and \"Eric\". The only band member photos on the album were those of Gouldman and Stewart. The album yielded the following singles: \"Les Nouveaux Riches\"/\"I Hate To Eat Alone\" (UK release); \"Don't Turn Me Away\"/\"Tomorrow's World Today\"; \"The Power of Love\"/\"You're Coming Home Again\" (released with \"Action Man in a Motown Suit\" as the B-side in some countries); \"Memories\"/\"Overdraft in Overdrive\" (Holland only); \"Run Away\"/\"Action Man in a Motown Suit\"; \"We've Heard It All Before\"/\"Overdraft in Overdrive\" (UK only). \"Memories\" was also scheduled for UK release in February 1982 but substituted with \"The Power of Love\" a month later. Recording was split between the band's two studios, Strawberry Studios South at Dorking, Surrey, and Strawberry Studios North at Stockport, Greater Manchester. Cover design for the album was by Visible Ink Ltd, which also created the cover for ABC's The Lexicon of Love (1982). Following Ten Out of 10, the band ended its stint with Warner Bros. Records. Their following release, Windows in the Jungle, would be released on Mercury Records."@en ;

It is the second album of his project, the Hofner Blue Notes. The book relates the history of 'The Delmonts', an imaginary band in the early 1960s, who evolved into The Hofner Bluenotes. It also gives a brief history of the Hofner guitar, and its importance in the development of music in Britain. The book is lavishly illustrated with period photos and mocked up posters and newspaper cuttings about the band, together with some of Rea's paintings, and photos of Hofner guitars. The music was recorded by Rea (guitars), Colin Hodgkinson (bass) and Martin Ditcham (drums), who feature in the book, together with Niel Drinkwater and Robert Ahwai. After the album was released, Rea started a European tour. He and his band would perform as a quintet. The concerts were divided in three sections: in the first, they would play only songs from Delmonts (CD1), then some blues songs from Fabulous Hofner Blue Notes (CD2), and in the third part Rea's greatest hits (like: The Road to Hell, Josephine, On the Beach ...)."@en ;

It was recorded at an after-show party following their performances at the Storsj\u00F6yran festival in \u00D6stersund, Sweden. The track \"Balloon Ranger\" was said by Ane to be analogous to her troubles learning the English language, or rather how she sometimes comes up with nonsense words that have no inherent meaning. She later used the song's title for the name of her record label. Versions of the album were released in the UK and US in 2006, and in Japan in 2007, each with different tracklistings and different artwork. The original album was re-released on CD for the European market in spring 2010, featuring new artwork (the same as that used for the 2006 US release) and a bonus track, \"Half Open Door\"."@en ;

Unlike the more nostalgic themes of many Kinks albums prior to Low Budget, the album contains many songs that appeal to current events of the time. Musically, the album is a continuation of the band's \"arena rock\" phase, resulting in a more rock-based sound and more modern production techniques. Despite being a relative failure in the UK, Low Budget was a great success for the group in the US, not only becoming their best-selling non-compilation album, but also peaking at #11 on the American album charts. The lead single, \"(Wish I Could Fly Like) Superman\" was also a minor hit in the US, reaching #41. The album was also praised by many critics in the US, although reception was more mixed in the band's native UK."@en ;

The album is eclectic in nature, ranging all the way from industrial metal with \"Schattenreiter\", thrash metal with \"Geisterstunde\", and even rockabilly with \"Im Tiefen Gras\" to the gothic-influenced \"Spieler\" with many songs emanating a dance music feel to them.

	dbo:abstract	"Silverball is the eleventh full-length original-material studio album by Barenaked Ladies. The album was released on June 2, 2015. The album is the band's third studio album since the departure of founding member Steven Page in February 2009. The album was recorded in late 2014 and early 2015 with producer Gavin Brown. \"Matter of Time\", a song from the album, was a digital pre-release give-away to ticketbuyers of the band's Last Summer On Earth 2015 tour. The cover art for the album, which shares a name with one of its songs, apparently depicts a pinball sitting on a pinball table surface, reflecting the darkened figure of a man playing. Lead singer and guitarist Ed Robertson, an acknowledged longtime video game fanatic turned his interest towards pinball in the 2010s, amassing a collection of machines. The lead single from the album, \"Say What You Want\", was made available for streaming on April 27, 2015, then for digital download the following day. On May 4, 2015, a video for the title track, \"Silverball\", was released as a thank you from Robertson to the community of the pinball website Pinside.com for their technical assistance with his pinball machines as well as the experience he has had as a part of the community. It was released for digital download the following day. For a limited time, Best Buy offered a retailer-exclusive edition of the album in the United States including \"Counting Down\" and \"Fall Back On\", two songs which were initially cut from the album. Both songs are exclusive to Spotify in Canada, who also offer a track-by-track commentary by the band for the album. In Canada, the album debuted with 4,000 copies sold in its first week of release. A lyric video for the second single, \"Duct Tape Heart\", was released July 10, 2015. The album was released on vinyl July 31, 2015. The proper music video for \"Duct Tape Heart\", containing live footage of the band's performance at Red Rocks Amphitheatre on the Last Summer On Earth 2015 tour, was released on October 19, 2015 to coincide with the start of the Canadian leg of the Silverball tour. BNL Rocks Red Rocks, a live album recorded at Red Rocks Amphitheatre during the touring for Silverball, is set to be released May 20, 2016."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Song Spells, No. 1: Cedarsmoke, while not an official studio album, is the 4th LP by the Los Angeles based band Sea Wolf, led by Alex Brown Church. Song Spells is a new Sea Wolf project made up of a series of non-studio albums written and recorded within four month periods. Church has said he will 'do the albums in between official albums', while indicating that the band would begin work on the next official studio album immediately following the release of Cedarsmoke. Unlike the band's 3 studio LP's, Leaves in the River (2007), White Water, White Bloom (2009) and Old World Romance (2012), which all saw wide releases through Dangerbird Records, Cedarsmoke began as a 'stripped down' unofficial album and was meant to explore the sonic landscape and feel of the earliest Sea Wolf songs while also providing an outlet for Church to experiment with new ideas and working methods. Geared toward existing fans of the band, the album was not intended as the next 'official' label-backed studio album, and was funded through a highly successful Kickstarter campaign. During the 4 month process of writing and recording the album, the idea of the series came about, and while it was never intended to be released on a wide scale, soon after its completion it was announced that this first entry in the series would be 'given back to fans' by releasing it exclusively through music streaming service Spotify and as a pay-what-you-wish download on the band's website."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Drum's Not Dead is the third album by experimental rock band Liars, released in 2006 through Mute Records. It was recorded in at Planet Roc studios in Berlin and produced by Angus Andrew. The sound is characterized by pounding drums, highly distorted guitar drones, and falsetto vocals. Upon initial release, the album featured a DVD with three different music videos for each song. The album's title and several track names refer to two fictional characters: Drum and Mount Heart Attack. For the band they are like Yin and Yang, each a state of being. Drum is assertive and productive, the spirit of creative confidence. With two drum kits integral to many of these percussive, propulsive, highly rhythmic convulsions, Drum came to be acknowledged as a fourth member of the band. Conversely, Mount Heart Attack is the reaction to Drum's action, the embodiment of stress and self-doubt. Both became key elements in the creative process. Pitchfork Media ranked the album number 6 on their list of the Top 50 albums of 2006."@en ;

However, all the members had performed with core duo Paul Butler and Aaron Fletcher before the album was produced, whether in other projects or simply in informal jams. The album was originally planned to be recorded in Butler's shed (the same one where Sunshine Hit Me was produced). However, the band decided to record it at the famous Abbey Road Studios; Indeed, Free the Bees is a much more slick-sounding and uptempo album than their debut, but the group's diverse range of styles and influences remain intact. \"Chicken Payback\" was used in a UK advert for Sure Deodorant For Men during the 2006 World Cup and was subsequently used in adverts for Age UK."@en ;

However unlike their debut it did not sell very well, and led to the band being dumped by their label (679 Recordings). With this album The Futureheads garnered comparisons to Blur, and particularly the album Modern Life Is Rubbish. It was produced by Ben Hillier, who has also produced for Blur and Depeche Mode. Singer/lyricist/guitarist Barry Hyde has revealed recently that second single \"Worry About It Later\" concerns \"...modern attitudes towards casual sex\". The song 'News and Tributes' is dedicated to the victims of the Munich air disaster, when a plane with many Manchester United players on board crashed in Munich in 1958.

Like The Capitol Albums, Volume 1, the CDs did not contain the original George Martin mixes released in Britain in the 1960s. Instead, the CDs were mastered from mixes prepared by Capitol A&R executive Dave Dexter, Jr., who, in 1965 took the submaster tapes from Capitol Records' vaults and added reverb to several tracks and simulated stereo on mono tracks (the proof that these are Dexter's mixes being the false start on \"I'm Looking Through You\"). Initially, however, the CDs only used Dexter's stereo mixes, with the mono tracks consisting of the two stereo channels folded into a single channel. Dexter's mono mixes were made available on the second pressings of these albums. The official release date of 11 April 2006, was the 42nd anniversary of The Beatles holding a record 14 positions in the Billboard Hot 100 chart.

The sleeve depicts a futuristic updated version of the band's Princess logo, who was first pictured on Level 42's self-titled debut album in 1981, which although not credited was inspired by the figure of Maria of the 1927 film, Metropolis."@en ;

dbr:The_Mystery_of_Life	rdf:type	schema:MusicAlbum ;
	dbo:abstract	"The Mystery of Life is the 77th album by country singer Johnny Cash, released in 1991, and his last for Mercury Records. The songs featured are culled from both recent sessions and from leftovers from Cash's first Mercury session in 1986 for the album Johnny Cash is Coming to Town. It includes new recordings of two songs already associated with him from his Sun and Columbia days, \"Hey Porter\" and \"Wanted Man\". \"I'll Go Somewhere and Sing My Songs Again\" is a duet with Tom T. Hall. The album's poor performance on the charts (it peaked at #70) and that of \"Goin' by the Book\", the only single to chart (at #69), coupled with Cash's unsteady relationship with Mercury, ensured his departure from the label following the album's release. In 2003, the album was re-released with \"The Wanderer\" from U2's 1993 Island Records album Zooropa as a bonus track. In 2006, \"I'm an Easy Rider\" and \"Beans for Breakfast\" were used in the soundtrack to the video game Scarface: The World Is Yours. According to Cash's 1997 biography, Mercury only pressed 500 copies of the album, biographer Robert Hilburn in Johnny Cash: The Life (2013) dismisses this as an exaggeration on Cash's part. This was the final new studio album release to feature drummer W.S. \"Fluke\" Holland, who had been a member of Cash's backing group and featured on almost all of his recordings since the 1950s, as Holland would not participate in the recording sessions for the Johnny Cash Country Christmas or the recordings made for American Recordings, though he would continue to perform with Cash in concert."@en ;

Several new tracks, including the single \"Taking Back Control\" are available for streaming on the band's MySpace page. The album was made available for streaming several days before its release on the band's MySpace site. A leaked copy of the album surfaced on the internet as well during early October 2006. Initial reviews were mixed, ranging from average to excellent (see reviews section). The album is generally considered to be darker and more complex than previous offerings, differing greatly from previous material in some places with callbacks in others. Jim Ward explains the meaning of Threes. \"Threes is a reference to the number 3 being important in my life. A lot of intersections happen involving that number, this record was a big changing point for me. The artwork is left to be interpreted by the viewer, you get a lot of interesting ideas form [sic] folks, I like it.\" On April 9, 2008 an official blog was posted on Sparta's Myspace page announcing the release of Threes on double vinyl after being in development for some time. It is limited to 1,000 copies with 3 different colors, and features a completely different track listing, including the bonus tracks split up amongst various versions of the CD release. 200 copies on peach vinyl with black splatter, 300 copies on white vinyl, 500 copies on black vinyl with peach splatter.

Crazy Town stated they were not personally disappointed that the album did not sell as well as their last, The Gift of Game, considering they were moving the band in a new direction, away from the pop success they achieved with their number 1 song \"Butterfly\". Crazy Town broke up several months after the album's release, citing amongst other things, pressure from their record company for a \"Butterfly\" follow-up. The second and final single, \"Hurt You So Bad\", features Rivers Cuomo from Weezer on the track's guitar solo.

	dbo:abstract	"Fourteen Autumns & Fifteen Winters is the debut studio album by Scottish indie rock band The Twilight Sad, released by FatCat Records on 3 April 2007 in the US, and 7 May 2007 in the UK. The album features production from guitarist Andy MacFarlane and was mixed by Peter Katis. It was recorded over a short period of just three days, and the songs featured were the first ones the band had ever written. The album's influences include Van Dyke Parks, Phil Spector, Daniel Johnston, Arab Strap, Serge Gainsbourg, and Leonard Cohen. Vocalist James Graham commented on the difference between the band's live show and the album, stating that, \"If you came to see us live before you actually heard the record or any recordings we made, you'd probably think we were kind of a noisy band. If you had the record and sat down with it, you can totally see it's more than noise.\" \"That Summer, at Home I Had Become the Invisible Boy\", \"Last Year's Rain Didn't Fall Quite So Hard\", and \"And She Would Darken the Memory\" also appear on the band's debut EP, The Twilight Sad, while four tracks from the album would later appear on Here, It Never Snowed. Afterwards It Did in a re-recorded state. The Twilight Sad performed Fourteen Autumns & Fifteen Winters in its entirety for the first time in December 2013, with further UK dates performing the full album in April and May 2014. The tour dates coincided with the release of a deluxe edition reissue of the album, with bonus tracks including demos and rarities, released on Record Store Day 2014. The reissue was pressed as a double vinyl LP, limited to 500 copies only, and available in the United Kingdom only."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Moby Grape '69 is the third album by the psychedelic rock band Moby Grape. It is the first album after the departure of co-founder Skip Spence. Spence nonetheless is heard on one song, \"Seeing\", presumably from the Wow/Grape Jam sessions, and positioned as the final song on Moby Grape '69. As Peter Lewis describes the album, \"We made Moby Grape '69, in an attempt to rebound from the Wow album, which was over-produced. And it's a cool album. Although we could have rehearsed it a little more, we still believed in it. But I think we were waiting for Skippy to come back, and he never did.\" The album peaked at a disappointing number 113 on the Billboard chart. While it did not sell well at the time of its release, in a recent (2008) review, it is pointed out that the album would be particularly appreciated by persons who like the music of Poco and The Eagles. For Moby Grape fans at the time, the album was perhaps too country in musical orientation. In some respects, the album was ahead of its time, predating the more popular first country rock releases by Poco and The Eagles."@en ;

According to Allmusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine, it is \"the first comprehensive, multi-label Waylon Jennings retrospective ever assembled, comprising ninety-two songs recorded between 1958 and 1994, with selections from the majority of the singer's recording career. The first track of the box set is the Buddy Holly-produced \"Jole Blon,\" released in 1958, while the last is \"I Do Believe,\" a song produced by Don Was that was included on The Highwaymen's 1995 release, The Road Goes on Forever. The other material on the box set covers Jennings' career chronologically, with songs ranging from his years on RCA's roster to later compositions from his short-lived stay at Epic Records; it ignores, however, the tracks from Jennings albums released on independent labels. The majority of the singer's charting singles are included in the package, as are collaborations such as \"Mamas Don't Let Your Babies Grow Up to Be Cowboys\" with Willie Nelson and \"Highwayman\" with The Highwaymen. A notable addition is the previously unreleased \"The Greatest Cowboy of Them All,\" a 1978 duet with Johnny Cash which was later recorded by Cash alone for A Believer Sings the Truth (1979) and The Mystery of Life (1991); two others, \"It's Sure Been Fun\" and \"People in Dallas Got Hair,\" had never been released in the United States.

	dbo:abstract	"Put Your Ghost To Rest is Kevin Devine's fourth studio album. It was released on October 17, 2006 through Capitol Records. It was his first and only major label release as of 2009. It was produced by Rob Schnapf, who had previously produced records by Elliott Smith, of whom Kevin is an avid fan. In regards to the album's political and social themes, Kevin said that \"I was always very abstractly political. I listened to punk rock records and thought I could punch my time card. And then all this shit in the world made me have to sit up and pay attention \u2013 and that\u2019s a good thing. It\u2019s a scary time, so why ignore it?\u201D After being dropped by Capitol Records due to a merger with Virgin Records in early 2007, Put Your Ghost to Rest had become increasingly hard to find in retail locations. In late 2007, Kevin had hinted at a re-release of the album with the aid of Brand New's record label, Procrastinate! Music Traitors and was officially released on April 20, 2008. Both physical and digital versions of the album are available. Kevin stated \"Capitol was cool enough to give us the record back with minimal hassle, which I'm real grateful for\". A limited double LP vinyl version of Put Your Ghost To Rest was released by Brooklyn-based label Academy Fight Song in May 2007, limited to 500 copies on solid white/solid orange vinyl. The double LP also includes three b-sides: \"Harvest Moon\" by Neil Young, \"Holland, 1945\" by Neutral Milk Hotel, and a new version of Devine's own \"Wolf's Mouth\" (all of which also featured on the 2007 Tour EP). This vinyl is currently out-of-print. Paxen Films (a film collective featuring future Goddamn Band members Mike Strandberg and Brian Bonz) created a music video for Brooklyn Boy and a video featuring live clips and backstage footage for Me and My Friends. Promo singles featuring Brooklyn Boy and Just Stay were produced, but no single was commercially released."@en ;

Following the release of the band's Mercury Prize-winning debut Myths of the Near Future in 2007, Klaxons began working on their second effort the following year. The band returned to working with original producer James Ford, aiming for release in early 2009. In March 2009, it was reported that the band had been told to re-record parts of their second album, with initial efforts rejected by Polydor for being \"too experimental for release\". The album was eventually recorded between November 2009 and February 2010 with producer Ross Robinson. Surfing the Void reached number ten on the UK Albums Chart, as well as multiple charts worldwide. The album marked Klaxons' first entry into the Australian market at the time, debuting at number 15 on the ARIA Charts. Critical reception to the album was generally favourable, with many reviewers commenting on the band's progression from their debut."@en ;

It was recorded in September 1981 at a free benefit concert in Central Park, New York City, where the pair performed in front of more than 500,000 people. Proceeds went toward the redevelopment and maintenance of the run-down green space in the middle of Manhattan. This concert and album marked the start of a short-lived reunion for Paul Simon and Art Garfunkel. The concept of a benefit concert in Central Park had been proposed by Parks Commissioner Gordon Davis and promoter Ron Delsener. Television channel HBO agreed to carry the concert, and worked with Delsener to decide on Simon and Garfunkel as the appropriate act for this event. Besides hit songs from their years as a duo, their set-list included material from their solo and duo careers, and covers. The show consisted of 21 songs, though two were not used in the live album. Among the songs performed were the classics \"The Sound of Silence\", \"Mrs. Robinson\", and \"The Boxer\"; the event concluded with a reprise of Simon's song, \"Late in the Evening\". Ongoing personal tensions between the duo led them to decide against a permanent reunion, despite the success of the concert and a subsequent world tour. The album and a film were released the year after the concert. Simon and Garfunkel's performance was praised by music critics and the album was commercially successful; it peaked at number six on the Billboard 200 album charts and was certified double platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). The video recordings were initially broadcast on HBO, and were subsequently made available on VHS and DVD."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"The Mirrors of My Soul is an album by the Palestinian artist Rim Banna, released in 2005. Rim Banna, who gained global recognition as part of the Lullabies from the Axis of Evil project returns with a Norwegian band with a decidedly folk-pop recording of Palestinian songs. Produced in cooperation with a Norwegean quintet, it features \"Western pop styling\" fused with Middle Eastern modal and vocal structures, and Arabic lyrics. Though the style of this album differs from previous recordings, the subject matter has basically remained constant. The album includes \"songs of despair and hope\" about the lives of \"a struggling people, and even a song about late Palestinian leader and PA president Arafat in a way that is both thoughtful and subtle\"."@en ;

Other songs included on the album are \"stripped\" mixes of Jackson material, meaning the songs are of a quieter tone and most of the drums have been removed. Following a surge in Jackson's popularity after his death in June 2009, it was confirmed on July 7, that The Stripped Mixes would be released. The album was made available as a digital download on July 7, 2009, and as a CD on July 28. A remixed song, entitled \"I'll Be There (Minus Mix)\", was released on iTunes to promote the album on June 9, 2009, prior to Jackson's death. The Stripped Mixes was the second Jackson compilation album to be posthumously released, the first being The Collection; which was released over two weeks prior.

The album saw a move away from the rich soundscapes that characterised earlier works from Fields of the Nephilim towards a darker, more industrial/death metal sound. McCoy has stated that the album was in development hell for several years due to restrictions from the record label. The album is dedicated to Scarlett McCoy, Carl McCoy's daughter. A music video was created for \"Penetration\", and the song was later covered by Polish band Behemoth on their EP Slaves Shall Serve. The album is a concept album, and while McCoy remained largely silent about the themes, one possible explanation is that the story revolves around the Watchers and the Book of Enoch. The word \"zoon\" is derived from Greek, meaning \"living creature\" or \"beast\"."@en ;

The demand for the album was still very high, and eventually Travis Dickerson decided to attempt a re-pressing of the disc. However, as future projects took up a lot of time, fans were asked to pre-order the re-pressing of Crime Slunk Scene, with no set date for when the album would be re-released. When the pre-orders got to a certain amount, the re-pressing of the album was approved. Eventually, the album has been re-pressed on Apr 12 2007. By February of 2012, the album once again went out of print, and has yet to be repressed. In 2009, Dickerson used the same process to re-press the albums A Real Diamond in the Rough and Slaughterhouse on the Prairie.

Fuck World Trade, released through Alternative Tentacles, displays a freer approach, both lyrically and musically, than the previous work of the band, featuring longer songs and guest appearances by Anti-Flag on \"Via Sin Dios\" as well as \"circus-punks\" The World/Inferno Friendship Society on \"Soon We'll Be Dead.\" Despite this, it maintains the distinctive \"squat-core\" style members of Left\u00F6ver Crack coined to describe their previous band Choking Victim: high-speed ska mixed with thrashy punk and filled with rawly-screamed laments on and indictments of capitalism, the police, homelessness, drug addiction, and American culture. The last track Operation M.O.V.E. is a black metal influenced track about an 1985 incident in Philadelphia where police dropped a bomb on the radical African American MOVE organization, killing eleven MOVE members including five children. It also features a secret instrumental that brings the track length to over 10 minutes. The album was reissued by Fat Wreck Chords in 2015 with four previously unreleased tracks."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Greatest Hits is a 1992 compilation album by the Cuban-American singer-songwriter Gloria Estefan. Musically, it includes songs with soft rock influenced sounds as well as more upbeat Latin pop works inspired by dance music. The tracks were gathered from various releases over the 1985 to 1992 period. As well as serving as a collection of her greatest hits both as a solo artist and with Miami Sound Machine, the album also contained four previously unreleased songs. Although credited solely to Estefan on the front cover, several tracks include the full band Miami Sound Machine (which would later become her backing group). The most well-known, U.S. and Canadian album release has some differences from alternate releases in different regions. Many international releases of the album included the songs \"Dr. Beat\" and \"Bad Boy\", though the Australian and New Zealand release replaced \"Bad Boy\" with \"Cuts Both Ways\". A limited edition Australian double CD set later came out featuring a special \"Megamix\" - a medley of Estefan's early dance hits. In 2013, the album was re-released in Brazil under the name Sele\u00E7\u00E3o Essencial with a new cover, though the track-listing remained the same."@en ;

Keyboards, strings and acoustic guitars abound, and even a pedal steel makes an appearance on \"Phone Sex.\" The band left \"Phone Sex\" out of the initial performances of the accompanying tour; with the 11 September 2001 attacks a painfully fresh memory, the members felt uncomfortable performing a song featuring the lyrics \"Plane crash footage on TV / I know, I know that could be me.\" The title of the album is taken from the opening of the song \"Out on the Wing.\""@en ;

This album is a recording of an intimate performance by the Hudsons, who were there to celebrate the opening weekend of the new London Public Library's wonderful Wolf Performance Hall in London, Ontario, Canada. Hudson displays a virtuosity on the piano that is reminiscent of Art Tatum. He weaves in and out of jazz standards, quoting from a wide range of jazz piano history. He is a master of the idiom and is as at home in Teddy Wilson style walking tenths, as in Harlem stride. During the concert, Hudson was on a wheeled secretary chair, and would wheel over to his wife Maud between numbers to confer on the next song they would play. This CD is one of a series of recordings on Canada's Make It Real Records (MIR), which is a boutique label, that specializes in recording real music, in real time on real instruments. \"Live at the Wolf\" is the only non-studio recording on the label. Other recordings by MIR include 2B3 The Toronto Sessions - various Hammond organ artists, My Regeneration - The Prima Donnas, Brotherhood - Blackburn, Footwork - Anderson & Sloski, Shorthanded - Lance Anderson."@en ;

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/The_World_Is_Not_Enough_(soundtrack)>	rdf:type	schema:MusicAlbum ;
	dbo:abstract	"The World Is Not Enough is the 1999 soundtrack of the 19th James Bond film of the same name and the second Bond soundtrack composed by David Arnold. The score features more instances of electronic music, which Arnold included to \"make the thing a little more contemporary\". To add an ethnic flavor to tracks that conveyed the film's Turkey and Central Asia setting, Arnold brought in percussionist Pete Lockett, qanun player Abdullah Chhadeh, and singer Natacha Atlas. Arnold broke tradition by not ending the film with a new song or a reprise of the opening theme. Originally, Arnold intended to use the song \"Only Myself to Blame\", written by David Arnold & Don Black and sung by Scott Walker and inspired by the failed romance between Bond and Elektra King, who turns out to be a villain. However, director Michael Apted \"felt it was too much of a downer for the end of the movie\" and Arnold replaced it with a techno remix of the \"James Bond Theme\". \"Only Myself to Blame\", is the nineteenth and final track on the album. The soundtrack was recorded across six days in September 1999 by an 83-piece orchestra conducted by Arnold collaborator Nicholas Dodd. Dodd described The World Is Not Enough as his favorite Bond score. Elektra King was provided with her own theme, most prominently heard in \"Casino,\" \"Elektra's Theme\" and \"I Never Miss.\" Arnold added two new themes to the Bond repertoire with this score, both of which are reused in Die Another Day. The first is an action theme, performed on the upper-registers of the piano, heard during \"Pipeline\" and \"Submarine.\" The second is a romance theme, first heard in the film during the skiing sequence, but not heard here until the \"Christmas in Turkey\" cue, in a simple arrangement for piano."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"A Night at the Met is the third official album release by Robin Williams on August 9, 1986. It features segments recorded live at Metropolitan Opera House in New York City. The album won the 1988 Grammy Award for Best Comedy Performance Single or Album, Spoken or Musical. The album was released the year before Williams' critically acclaimed performance in the motion picture Good Morning, Vietnam (1987). He had been shifting his focus from stand-up comedy to film making for several years, and A Night at the Met would be one of his last major concerts during the 1980s. The show is a mix of Williams' rapid-fire humor and voice work, with riffs on the topics of drugs, sex, world affairs, and parenting. References to the events and people of the 1980s are strewn heavily throughout; U.S. President Ronald Reagan, Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi, and President of the Soviet Union Mikhail Gorbachev are central to many of the jokes."@en ;

Named after its same-titled lead single, it marked the singer's first record under Clive Davis' J Records roster and was first released on October 21, 2002 in Japan. The tracks on the album are a mixture of uptempos and ballads, which are basically inspired by contemporary R&B and soul genres; it also features elements of hip hop, dance-pop and gospel music, crafted by musicians suchs as Dallas Austin, Bryan Michael Cox, Jermaine Dupri, Rodney \"Darkchild\" Jerkins, and Soulshock & Karlin. Released to mixed reviews by music critics, the album reached number 14 on the Japanese Albums Chart and was subsequently certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of Japan (RIAJ). Its preceding two singles, \"All Eyez on Me\" and \"Too Hood\", achieved moderate commercial success on the charts however. Expected to be released on November 12, 2002 in the United States, the album was eventually put on hold after it had experienced heavy bootlegging following its Japan-wide release and became widely available through Internet file-sharing services. The album was then partially re-recorded and retooled as After the Storm in 2003 with original album cut, \"U Should've Known Better\", released as its fourth single in 2004."@en ;

This album was originally intended to be front man Paul Westerberg's solo artist debut. As a result of its initial intent, All Shook Down is marked by numerous session, side and journeyman-musicians, supplemented by the three other 'Mats themselves. Replacements bassist Tommy Stinson plays bass and sings backup vocals on a number of the tracks, while guitarist Slim Dunlap and drummer Chris Mars appear on a few tracks each. John Cale, formerly of the Velvet Underground, plays viola on \"Sadly Beautiful\". The only track featuring the entire band performing together is the acoustic rave-up \"Attitude\". The band issued promotional-only singles for \"Merry Go Round\", \"Someone Take The Wheel\", \"When It Began\", and \"Happy Town\". \"Merry Go Round\" was the band's most successful Modern Rock Tracks single, reaching #1 for four non-consecutive weeks. Mars left the band in November 1990 (his last appearance as a Replacement being in the \"Merry Go Round\" video) and Steve Foley filled in on drums for the six-month All Shook Down Tour of 1991. The band were nominated for the Best Alternative Video and Best Special Effects categories at the 1991 MTV Video Music Awards for the claymation/live action music video for \"When It Began\". The band played its last show on Independence Day, July 4, 1991. They also received a nomination for a Grammy Award for Best Alternative Music Album.

They can be distinguished, as the first pressing of the vinyl is translucent when viewed in front of light and the 2nd pressing is opaque black. Some of the first pressings also included an alternate version of the sleeve and a small thank-you list in the form of an additional insert, which was not included with all copies. As of 2007 it has reached a value often over $200 on eBay auctions. Tracks 1 and 2 were rerecorded and released on the vinyl pressing of Very Proud of Ya and later on the AFI retrospective. Tracks 3-5 were rerecorded for AFI's debut full-length album, Answer That and Stay Fashionable. \"Born in the US of A\" appears nowhere else."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Couldn't Have Said It Better is a 2003 album by Meat Loaf. Only for the third time in his career, he released an album without any songs written by Jim Steinman (not counting the bonus tracks). Although Meat Loaf claimed that Couldn't Have Said It Better was \"the most perfect album [he] did since Bat Out of Hell\", it wasn't quite as successful. Three singles were released, \"Did I Say That\", \"Couldn't Have Said It Better\" and \"Man of Steel\", all with little chart impact. The album was recorded for Universal Music Germany's Polydor division and was licensed to Mercury Records for UK release and Sanctuary Records for US release, while global distribution was handled by parent company Universal Music Group. Most of this was caused by poor promotion on behalf of Sanctuary, the company that released the album in the US, and few actual singles being distributed, especially in the UK - his biggest market. The single \"Couldn't Have Said It Better\" feat. Patti Russo reached the AC Top 40 in the US, while the videos also had low budgets, in stark contrast to his 1990s videos. However, the album was a minor success worldwide and reached #4 in the UK charts. There were many writers for the album including Diane Warren and James Michael. Warren has written for Meat Loaf in the past and had some very big hits. Michael had never written for Meat Loaf before and it was only his songs that were released as singles from the album. Several versions of the album have been released, some with bonus-material. Also, the color of the album cover is different in the UK (blue) from the other territories (red)."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Dopethrone is the third studio album by English doom metal band Electric Wizard. It was released in 2000 through Rise Above Records and re-released by the same label in 2004 and 2007 with an extra song. Dopethrone, along with Come My Fanatics..., is often cited as Electric Wizard's seminal release and the highpoint of their career. Reviewers have described it as \"some of the absolute slowest, heaviest doom imaginable\" and have said \"it may well be the finest record to emerge from the whole British stoner-rock scene\". Speaking to Kerrang! in July 2009, Jus Oborn remembered: \"Most of us were stuck in some drug addiction or alcoholism at the time, and it was just pure hate. It was us against the world, and we just wanted to make the most disgusting, foul, putrid record that anyone has ever recorded. We camped out at the studio, so it was literally just wake up, consume as much fucking drugs as possible, and then just start jamming.\" On this album, Electric Wizard's very slow, heavy and psychedelic sound became more abrasive and aggressive. Jus Oborn's vocals are heavily manipulated and low in the mix and the guitars are extremely fuzzy. Dopethrone was crowned \"Album of the Decade\" (2000s) by Terrorizer magazine. The song \"Vinum Sabbathi\" appears in the documentary \"The Wild and Wonderful Whites of West Virginia\""@en ;

The mix is a retrospective look at a set at the Pacha club in Buenos Aires, Argentina. Dave Seaman arrives for the first of what turns out to be string of GU City releases spanning subsequent years. When asked which city he'd like to base it around, without hesitation he plumps for the burgeoning clubbing destination of Argentina\u2019s capital, a place where the crowds are famously wild, vocal and like to stay packing out the floor until the final record has finished. This mix takes in classics of the day like Underworld\u2019s \u2018Jumbo\u2019 and Polaroid\u2019s \u2018So Damn Beautiful\u2019 combined with some serious underground cuts for a fully rounded example of why Dave had risen to become one of the most in-demand spinners on the planet. The Channel 4 film crew making the infamous documentary about GU came along to shoot at the party. The vibe was so electric that Dave got a little carried away, busting out the breakdancing moves of his early youth on the packed Terrace for the cameras. The following day it transpired he had put his back out in the process."@en ;

The mix is a retrospective look at a set at the La Morocha club in Punta del Este, Uruguay. A popular techno and deep house DJ for many years in his own right, Darren Emerson\u2019s global profile had gone stellar with the huge success of Underworld, particularly following their chart-bothering re-release of Born Slippy. While making this mix out in Uruguay, on an afternoon stroll along the beach, Darren dropped the bombshell to GU's Andy that he was thinking of leaving the band.Andy tried to persuade him otherwise - at least until the album was out - but his mind was made up and the story was soon to break in the dance media anyway. Darren's departure was a big shock to his fans, but it made his debut GU mix one of his first public statements after the decision. As such, it became symbolic of his solo intent. It\u2019s a bold and tasty showcase of Emerson the club DJ, taking GU into deeper techno territory than it had gone before, while still joining the dots in terms of progression and an expansive musical vision. The prog purists of the day, who were still enraptured by the recent Digweed and Sasha GU mixes, were a little fazed by this one. However, Darren holds his own superbly over both CDs, introducing the likes of Speedy J and Dave Clarke to new ears."@en ;
