	dbo:abstract	"John Peter Farnham, Jr. AO (born 1 July 1949), formerly billed as Johnny Farnham from his professional debut in 1967 until 1980, is an English-born Australian pop singer. Farnham was a teen pop idol from 1964 to 1979, but has since forged a career as an adult contemporary singer. His career has mostly been as a solo artist although he replaced Glenn Shorrock as lead singer of Little River Band from 1982 to 1985. In September 1986 his solo single, \"You're the Voice\" peaked at No. 1 on the Australian singles charts. The associated album, Whispering Jack, held the No. 1 position for a total of 25 weeks and is the highest-selling album in Australian history. Both the single and the album had Top Ten success internationally including No. 1 in Sweden, hero. Domestically he has remained one of Australia's best-known performers with a career spanning over 45 years, and he is the only Australian artist to have a number one record in five consecutive decades (echoing that of Cliff Richard in the UK) with singles: \"Sadie (The Cleaning Lady)\" in 1967, \"Raindrops Keep Fallin' on My Head\" in 1969/1970, and \"Age of Reason\" in 1988; and albums: Age of Reason, Chain Reaction in 1990, Then Again... in 1993, Anthology 1: Greatest Hits 1986\u20131997 in 1997, 33\u2153 in 2000, The Last Time in 2002  and Two Strong Hearts Live in 2015, hero. Farnham has been recognised by honours and awards including 1987 Australian of the Year, 1996 Officer of the Order of Australia, and 19 ARIA Awards including his 2003 induction into the Hall of Fame. From 1969 he was voted by TV Week readers as the 'King of Pop' for five consecutive years. Aside from his recording career, Farnham performed on stage with lead roles in Australian productions of Charlie Girl, Pippin and 1992's Jesus Christ Superstar. He starred in his own TV series and specials including It's Magic (With Colleen Hewett) and Bobby Dazzler and as a guest on numerous other popular shows such as Countdown and Hey Hey It's Saturday. Australian rock historian, Ian McFarlane described him as \"the most successful solo artist in the history of Australian rock and pop ... Farnham has retained an affable sense of humour and a simple, unpretentious 'everyman' charm which also makes him one of the most respected celebrities and dead set legends in Australian entertainment history.\""@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"John McLaughlin (born 4 January 1942 in Doncaster, West Riding of Yorkshire, England), also known as Mahavishnu John McLaughlin, is an English guitarist, bandleader and composer. His music includes many genres of jazz which he coupled with elements of rock, Indian classical music, Western classical music, flamenco and blues to become one of the pioneering figures in fusion. After contributing to several key British groups of the early 1960s McLaughlin made Extrapolation, his first album as a bandleader, in 1969. He then moved to the U.S., where he played with Tony Williams's group Lifetime and then with Miles Davis on his electric jazz-fusion albums In a Silent Way, Bitches Brew, A Tribute to Jack Johnson, and On the Corner. His 1970s electric band, the Mahavishnu Orchestra, performed a technically virtuosic and complex style of music that fused electric jazz and rock with Indian influences. McLaughlin has been cited as an influence by a number of prominent musicians. He is a Grammy award winner and has been awarded multiple \"Guitarist of the year\" and \"Best Jazz Guitarist\" awards from magazines such as Down Beat and Guitar Player based on reader polls. In 2003, he was ranked 49th in Rolling Stone magazine's list of the \"100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time\". In 2010, guitarist Jeff Beck called him \"the best guitarist alive\"."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"John J Mellencamp (born October 7, 1951), also known as John Cougar Mellencamp, is an American musician, singer-songwriter, painter, and actor. He is known for his catchy, populist brand of heartland rock, which emphasizes traditional instrumentation. He rose to superstardom in the 1980s while \"honing an almost startlingly plainspoken writing style that, starting in 1982, yielded a string of Top 10 singles,\" including \"Hurts So Good,\" \"Jack & Diane,\" \"Crumblin' Down,\" \"Pink Houses,\" \"Lonely Ol' Night,\" \"Small Town,\" \"R.O.C.K. in the U.S.A.,\" \"Paper in Fire,\" and \"Cherry Bomb.\" He has amassed 22 Top 40 hits in the United States. In addition, he holds the record for the most tracks by a solo artist to hit number one on the Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks chart, with seven, and has been nominated for 13 Grammy Awards, winning one. Mellencamp released his latest album, Plain Spoken, on September 23, 2014, to widespread critical acclaim. Mellencamp is also one of the founding members of Farm Aid, an organization that began in 1985 with a concert in Champaign, Illinois, to raise awareness about the loss of family farms and to raise funds to keep farm families on their land. Farm Aid concerts have remained an annual event over the past 31 years, and as of 2016 the organization has raised over $50 million to promote a strong and resilient family farm system of agriculture. Mellencamp was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame on March 10, 2008. His biggest musical influences are Bob Dylan, Woody Guthrie, James Brown and the Rolling Stones. Said longtime Rolling Stone contributor Anthony DeCurtis: \"Mellencamp has created an important body of work that has earned him both critical regard and an enormous audience. His songs document the joys and struggles of ordinary people seeking to make their way, and he has consistently brought the fresh air of common experience to the typically glamour-addled world of popular music.\" The late Billboard magazine editor-in-chief Timothy White said in 2001: John Mellencamp is arguably the most important roots rocker of his generation. John has made fiddles, hammer dulcimers, Autoharps and accordions lead rock instruments on a par with electric guitar, bass and drums, and he also brought what he calls 'a raw Appalachian' lyrical outlook to his songs. Mellencamp's best music is rock 'n roll stripped of all escapism, and it looks directly at the messiness of life as it's actually lived. In his music, mortality, anxiety, acts of God, questions of romance and brotherhood, and crises of conscience all collide and demand hard decisions. This is rock music that tells the truth on both its composer and the culture he's observing. Johnny Cash called Mellencamp \"one of the 10 best songwriters\" in music."@en ;

Born and raised in Maywood, Illinois, Prine learned to play the guitar at the age of 14. Subsequently, serving in West Germany with the U.S. armed forces, by the late 1960s he had moved to Chicago, where he worked as a mailman, writing and singing songs as a hobby. Becoming a part of the city's folk revival, he was discovered by Kris Kristofferson, resulting in the production of Prine's self-titled debut album through Atlantic Records in 1971. After receiving critical acclaim, Prine focused on his musical career, recording three more albums for Atlantic. He then signed to Asylum Records, where he recorded an additional three albums. In 1984 he co-founded Oh Boy Records, an independent record label with which he would release most of his subsequent albums.After his battle with squamous cell cancer in 1998, Prine's vocals deepened into a gravel-voice, resulting in the award-winning album Fair & Square (2005). Widely cited as one of the most influential songwriters of his generation, Prine is known for humorous lyrics about love, life, and current events, as well as serious songs with social commentary, or which recollect melancholy tales from his life."@en ;

An icon in the French-speaking world since the beginning of his career, he has been called \"the French Elvis\". He was married for 15 years to popular Bulgarian-French singer Sylvie Vartan and the two were considered a \"golden couple\" for 20 years. Hallyday has completed 181 tours, had 18 platinum albums, and has sold more than 80 million records worldwide, making him one of the world's best-selling music artists of all time.

	dbo:abstract	"Johnny Marr (born John Martin Maher; 31 October 1963) is an English musician, songwriter and singer. Between 1982 and 1987 he was the guitarist and \u2013 with Morrissey \u2013 co-songwriter of The Smiths, an English rock band formed in Manchester. Critics have called them the most important alternative rock band to emerge from the British independent music scene of the 1980s. Q magazine's Simon Goddard argued in 2007 that the Smiths were \"the most influential British guitar group of the decade\" and the \"first indie outsiders to achieve mainstream success on their own terms\". NME named The Smiths the \"most influential artist ever\" in a 2002 poll, even topping The Beatles. Marr has also been a member of Electronic, an alternative dance supergroup formed with New Order singer and guitarist Bernard Sumner; The The, an English musical and multimedia group led by singer/songwriter Matt Johnson; Modest Mouse, an American indie rock band formed in 1993 in Issaquah, Washington; and The Cribs, an English three-piece indie rock band originally from Wakefield, West Yorkshire. As well, he has worked as a prolific session musician. In 2013, he released a solo album titled The Messenger (2013). In 2013, NME honoured Marr with its \"Godlike Genius\" award, hailing him: \"Not content with rewriting the history of music with one of the world's greatest ever bands, the Smiths, he's continued to push boundaries and evolve throughout his career, working with some of the best and most exciting artists on the planet.\" He was voted the fourth best guitarist of the last 30 years in a poll conducted by the BBC in 2010. Phil Alexander, Editor-in-Chief of Mojo, has described Marr as \"arguably Britain's last great guitar stylist\"."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Jonathan Richard Guy \"Jonny\" Greenwood (born 5 November 1971) is an English musician and composer best known as the lead guitarist and keyboardist of the alternative rock band Radiohead. A multi-instrumentalist, Greenwood also plays instruments including the bass guitar, piano, viola, and drums, and is a prominent player of the ondes Martenot, an early electronic instrument. He works with electronic techniques such as programming, sampling and looping, and writes music software used by Radiohead. He described his role in the band as an arranger, helping to transform singer Thom Yorke's demos into full songs. He has been named one of the greatest guitarists of all time by publications including the NME, Rolling Stone and Spin. Greenwood was born in Oxford, England. As a boy he played in youth orchestras, and he is the only Radiohead member to have studied music theory. Along with his older brother, Radiohead bassist Colin, he attended Abingdon School, where he met the other members of Radiohead. The youngest of the group, Greenwood was the last to join, playing first keyboards and harmonica but soon becoming lead guitarist. He abandoned a degree in music when Radiohead signed to Parlophone; their debut single \"Creep\" was distinguished by Greenwood's aggressive guitar work, and Radiohead have gone on to achieve critical acclaim and sales of over 30 million albums. Greenwood first composed for orchestra during the recording of Radiohead's fourth album, Kid A (2000). Subsequent Radiohead albums have featured his string and brass arrangements, and he has since composed for orchestras including the London Contemporary Orchestra and the BBC Concert Orchestra. He released his first solo work, the soundtrack for the film Bodysong, in 2003, and has since scored the films There Will Be Blood (2007), Norwegian Wood (2010), We Need To Talk About Kevin (2011), The Master (2012) and Inherent Vice (2014), working with director Paul Thomas Anderson on several occasions. He has collaborated with musicians including Israeli composer Shye Ben Tzur, singer Bryan Ferry, rapper MF Doom, and singer Frank Ocean."@en ;

Arthur was discovered by Peter Gabriel in the mid-1990s, and signed to Gabriel's Real World label as the first North American artist on the label's roster. Arthur released his debut album, Big City Secrets (1997), and follow-up, Come to Where I'm From (2000), on Real World before signing with various independent labels between 2002 and 2006. He established his own record label, Lonely Astronaut Records, in 2006, and released two studio albums, Let's Just Be (2007) and Temporary People (2008) with backing band The Lonely Astronauts. Arthur subsequently returned to performing and recording as a solo artist, releasing The Graduation Ceremony in 2011 and the double album, Redemption City in 2012. In 2013, Arthur started a Pledge Music campaign to fund the release of his tenth studio album, The Ballad of Boogie Christ. The album was released on June 11, 2013.

	dbo:abstract	"Juan Luis Guerra Seijas (born June 7, 1957), known professionally as Juan Luis Guerra, is a Dominican singer, songwriter, composer, and producer. He has sold over 30 million records, and has won numerous awards including 18 Latin Grammy Awards, two Grammy Awards, and two Latin Billboard Music Awards. Guerra won 3 Latin Grammy Awards in 2010, including Album of the Year. In 2012, he won the Latin Grammy Award for Producer of the Year. Guerra is one of the most internationally recognized Latin artists of recent decades. His popular style of merengue and Afro-Latin fusion has garnered him considerable success throughout Latin America. He is also credited for popularizing bachata music on a global level and is often associated with the genre, although his distinct style of bachata features a more traditional bolero rhythm and aesthetic mixed with bossa-nova influenced melodies and harmony in some of his songs. He does not limit himself to one style of music; instead, he incorporates diverse rhythms like merengue, bachata-fusion, balada, salsa, rock and roll, and even gospel. \"Ojal\u00E1 Que Llueva Caf\u00E9\" (\"I Hope it Rains Coffee\") is one of his most critically acclaimed pieces."@en ;

She rose to fame in 2002 after winning the inaugural season of American Idol, and has since been referred to as the \"Original American Idol\" and the \"Queen of Covers\". Her debut single, \"Before Your Love\"/\"A Moment Like This\", topped the Billboard Hot 100 chart and became the best-selling single of 2002 in the United States. She became the runner-up of World Idol the following year. Clarkson's debut studio album, Thankful (2003), debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200. It was certified double platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) while selling over 4.5 million copies worldwide. Its lead single, \"Miss Independent\", reached the top ten in various nations. Trying to reinvent her own image, Clarkson decided to part ways with American Idol management and developed a rock-oriented sound for her second album, Breakaway (2004). It sold over 15 million copies worldwide and earned Clarkson two Grammy Awards. Taking creative control of her third album, My December (2007), she served as the executive producer and co-wrote the entire album's material. However, she fought with her label, in particular Clive Davis, who was dissatisfied with her musical direction. The feud resulted the reluctance of her label to promote the album. Clarkson's fourth album, All I Ever Wanted (2009), became her second album to debut at No. 1 on the Billboard 200. Its lead single, \"My Life Would Suck Without You\", holds the record for the biggest jump to number one on the Hot 100. Clarkson's fifth studio album, Stronger (2011), won the Grammy Award for Best Pop Vocal Album, making her the only act to receive the award twice. The album scored her third number-one song on the Hot 100, \"Stronger (What Doesn't Kill You)\". Clarkson's sixth album and first Christmas music release, Wrapped in Red (2013), became the best-selling holiday album of the year, making her the first American female artist to achieve this goal. In 2015, Clarkson released her seventh studio album, Piece by Piece, which was her third album to debut at No. 1 on the Billboard 200. Its title track became her eleventh top-ten entry on the Hot 100. Apart from her work in music, Clarkson has also ventured into television and film, beginning with her leading role in the romantic musical From Justin to Kelly (2003). She is known for her vocal versatility and range. Her music has mainly dealt with themes of heartbreak, independence, and self-empowerment for women and young teens. Her musical work has also gained her numerous accolades, including three Grammy Awards, three MTV Video Music Awards, twelve Billboard Music Awards, four American Music Awards, and two Academy of Country Music Awards. In a career spanning over a decade, Clarkson has accumulated 100 Billboard number-one hits and sold over 25 million albums worldwide. In 2012, she was ranked nineteenth on VH1's list of \"100 Greatest Women in Music.\" Billboard also ranked Clarkson as the 14th-best-selling artist of the 2000s."@en ;

As a child, she was encouraged by her father to join him during his performances in local piano bars. After competing in local singing contests, Pausini signed her first recording contract. She rose to fame in 1993, winning the newcomer artists' section of the 43rd Sanremo Music Festival with her debut single \"La solitudine\", which became an Italian standard and an international hit, topping the charts in Italy, the Netherlands and Belgium. Her eponymous debut album was released in Italy on 23 April 1993 and later became an international success, selling two million copies worldwide. Its follow-up, Laura, was released in 1994 and confirmed her international success, selling three million copies worldwide. During the same year, she released her first Spanish-language album, Laura Pausini, composed of ten adapted songs originally included in her previous works. The album was certified diamond by the Association of Phonographic and Videographic of Spain, making her the first non-Spanish artist to sell more than one million copies in Spain. As of 2014, she has released ten studio albums, two international greatest hits albums and two compilation albums for the Hispanic and Anglophone market only, respectively. She mostly performs in Italian and Spanish, but she has also recorded songs in English, French, Portuguese and more recently, Catalan. Her only English-language album, From the Inside, was released in 2002, but failed to satisfy commercial expectations both in North America and in the rest of the world. In 2006, her record Io canto was the best-selling album of the year in Italy. In 2004, Allmusic's Jason Birchmeier considered Pausini's sales \"an impressive feat for someone who'd never really broken into the lucrative English\u2013language market\". Fimi certified Pausini's sales of more than 70 million records with a Fimi Icon Award. During her career, she has won numerous music awards in Italy and internationally.She has earned the first and third place at the Sanremo Music Festival, two \"Lunezia Awards\", ten Wind Music Awards, four awards at the Festivalbar, seven Telegatti and an MTV Italian Music Award. Internationally, she has won four awards at the Vi\u00F1a del Mar International Song Festival, three Lo Nuestro Awards, three Latin Grammy Awards, a Billboard Latin Music Award and six World Music Awards. In 2006 she also became the first Italian female artist to win a Grammy Award, receiving the accolade for Best Latin Pop Album for the record Escucha. She has been honoured as a Commander Order of Merit of the Italian Republic by President Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, and as a World Ambassador of Emilia Romagna."@en ;

Initially trained in violin and sculpting, Anderson pursued a variety of performance art projects in New York during the 1970s, making particular use of language, technology, and visual imagery. She became widely more known outside the art world in 1981 when her single \"O Superman\" reached number two on the UK pop charts. She also starred in and directed the 1986 concert film Home of the Brave. Anderson is a pioneer in electronic music and has invented several devices that she has used in her recordings and performance art shows. In 1977, she created a tape-bow violin that uses recorded magnetic tape on the bow instead of horsehair and a magnetic tape head in the bridge. In the late 1990s, she developed a talking stick, a six-foot (1.8 m) long baton-like MIDI controller that can access and replicate sounds. Anderson started dating Lou Reed in 1992, and was married to him from 2008 until his death in 2013."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Lauryn Hill (born May 26, 1975) is an American singer, songwriter, rapper, record producer, and actress. She is best known for being a member of the Fugees and for her critically acclaimed solo album The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill, which won numerous awards, broke several sales records and was listed by Rolling Stone as one of the greatest albums of all time. Raised mostly in South Orange, New Jersey, Hill began singing with her music-oriented family during her childhood. She enjoyed success as an actress at an early age, with her older brother Graham Hill, appearing in a recurring role on the television soap opera As the World Turns and starring in the 1993 film Sister Act 2: Back in the Habit. In high school, Hill was approached by Pras Michel to start a band, which his cousin, Wyclef Jean, soon joined. They renamed themselves the Fugees and released the albums Blunted on Reality (1994) and the Grammy Award-winning The Score (1996). In the latter record, which sold six million copies in the United States, Hill rose to prominence with her African-American and Caribbean music influences, her rapping and singing, and her rendition of the hit \"Killing Me Softly\". Hill's tumultuous romantic relationship with Jean led to the split of the band in 1997, after which she began to focus on solo projects. The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill (1998) remains Hill's only solo studio album. It received massive critical acclaim, showcasing a representation of life and relationships and locating a contemporary womanist voice within the neo soul genre. The album debuted at number one on the U.S. Billboard 200 and has sold approximately eight million copies there. It included the singles \"Doo Wop (That Thing)\" (also a number one), \"Ex-Factor\" (became her biggest solo hit in UK , and \"Everything Is Everything\" (recive gold in us). At the 41st Grammy Awards, the record earned her five awards, including Album of the Year and Best New Artist. During this time she won numerous other awards and became a common sight on the cover of magazines. Soon afterward, Hill dropped out of the public eye, dissatisfied with the music industry and suffering with the pressures of fame. Her last full-length recording, the new-material live album MTV Unplugged No. 2.0 (2002), sharply divided critics and sold poorly compared to her first album and work with the Fugees. Hill's subsequent activity, which includes the release of a few songs and occasional festival appearances, has been sporadic and erratic. Her behavior has sometimes caused audience dissatisfaction; a reunion with her former group did not last long. Her music, as well as a series of public statements she has issued, have become critical of pop culture and societal institutions. Hill has six children, five of whom are with Rohan Marley, son of reggae legend Bob Marley. In 2012, she pleaded guilty to tax evasion for failure to pay federal income taxes, and in 2013, served a three-month prison sentence."@en ;

He was one of the pioneers of the solid-body electric guitar, which made the sound of rock and roll possible. Paul taught himself how to play guitar and while he is mainly known for jazz and popular music, he had an early career in country music. He is credited with many recording innovations. Although he was not the first to use the technique, his early experiments with overdubbing (also known as sound on sound), delay effects such as tape delay, phasing effects and multitrack recording were among the first to attract widespread attention. His innovative talents extended into his playing style, including licks, trills, chording sequences, fretting techniques and timing, which set him apart from his contemporaries and inspired many guitarists of the present day. He recorded with his wife Mary Ford in the 1950s, and they sold millions of records. Among his many honors, Paul is one of a handful of artists with a permanent, stand-alone exhibit in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. He is prominently named by the music museum on its website as an \"architect\" and a \"key inductee\" along with Sam Phillips and Alan Freed. Les Paul is the only person to be included in both the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and the National Inventors Hall of Fame."@en ;

She was born and raised in Brooklyn, New York, living much of her adolescent life on the streets after being expelled from home. In her teens, Jones would freestyle rap, heavily influenced by actress/singer Diana Ross, and fellow female hip-hop artists like MC Lyte and The Lady of Rage. Performing a freestyle rap for The Notorious B.I.G. got her music career start in 1995 with his group Junior M.A.F.I.A., whose debut album Conspiracy generated two top 20 singles in the United States. Lil' Kim's debut studio album, Hard Core (1996) was certified double platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) and spawned three consecutive No. 1 rap hits: \"No Time\", \"Not Tonight (Ladies Night remix)\", and \"Crush on You\", a record for a female rapper. Her following albums, The Notorious K.I.M. (2000) and La Bella Mafia (2003), were certified Platinum, making her the only female rapper besides Missy Elliott to have at least 3 platinum albums. She was featured on the single \"Lady Marmalade\", which also had guest vocals by fellow recording artists M\u00FDa, Pink and Christina Aguilera (a remake of the 1975 smash hit, originally recorded by LaBelle) which went to No. 1 on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100, making her the second female rapper to have a No. 1 on that chart after Lauryn Hill. In addition, the remake won two MTV Video Music Awards including Video of the Year, and a Grammy Award for Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals at the 44th Grammy Awards in 2002. In 2005, she served a yearlong prison sentence for lying to a jury about her friends' involvement in a shooting four years earlier. During her incarceration, her fourth album The Naked Truth was released. She returned to the public eye in 2009 with an appearance on Dancing with the Stars.

The decapitalization of the words \"the great\" in Sienkowski's stage name is his own preferred spelling, and the title has appeared as such on all of his albums to date. He had the most requested song on the Dr. Demento radio show in 2002, 2003, 2011, and 2014 with his songs \"Peter Parker\" featuring Sudden Death, \"Stealing Like a Hobbit\", \"Snoopy the Dogg\", and \"Fake Adult\" respectively. Topics of his parodies have included The Lord of the Rings, Star Wars, Spider-Man, Keanu Reeves and Hamlet. He has, in one song, parodied all the Star Trek television shows. His parody songs are reminiscent of the pop music works of \"Weird Al\" Yankovic. Luke helped bring parodies of rap and hip-hop to Science Fiction conventions. He does not play an instrument, and sings to pre-recorded music, often in costume or with props. Much of his work satirizes science fiction movies, television, and their marketing and are often from a fan perspective. Many of his longer works are snippets of song parodies collected together into an extended medley, such as Grease Wars or It's A Fanboy Christmas. Since 1996, Luke has released numerous albums. He is a frequent performer at science fiction and gaming conventions. Luke is also a caricature artist, and has done the cover art for several of his own albums (with the notable exception of UnCONVENTIONal, which features the artwork of John Kovalic). Luke Ski hosts the weekly show Dementia Revolution on Dementia Radio and has a bi-monthly podcast that he hosts with back-up vocalist Carrie Dahlby called \"Luke and Carrie's Bad Rapport\" where in each episode there are several segments in which the two talk about different things; this podcast also regularly features comedy music. He also is the co-host of \"Kyle and Luke Talk About Toons\" where he and fellow comedy musician and artist Kyle Carrozza discuss animation related topics. Luke also works as a storyboard revisionist, writer and voice actor for Kyle's new series on Cartoon Network, Mighty Magiswords.Luke portrayed P.T. Barnum on three episodes of The Radio Adventures of Dr. Floyd. Luke appeared as several characters in the Shockwave Radio Theater production \"Let's Play Doctor\" at the 2004 Marscon. He wrote and performed the theme song for the independent parody fanfilm The Dork of the Rings."@en ;

Anderson charted 12 No. 1, 18 Top 10, and more than 50 Top 40 hit singles. In addition to being named \"Top Female Vocalist\" by the Academy of Country Music (ACM) twice and \"Female Vocalist of the Year\" by the Country Music Association (CMA), Anderson won a Grammy Award (earning seven nominations), People's Choice Award and an American Music Award (AMA). She was the #13 artist of the 1970s according to Joel Whitburn's \"Billboard Hot Country Singles\" book and the highest ranking artist of the list not yet in the Country Music Hall of Fame. Anderson was the first female country artist to win the American Music Award (in 1974), as well as the first to headline and sellout Madison Square Garden that same year. Anderson debuted in 1966, at the age of 19, and had her first hit with Ride, Ride, Ride. After a series of Top 10 hit singles on the country charts during the late 1960s, Anderson signed with Columbia Records in 1970. Under Columbia, she had her most successful string of hits. Her signature song, \"(I Never Promised You a) Rose Garden,\" remains one of the biggest selling country crossover hits of all time. In addition to topping the U.S. country charts for five weeks, the song reached No. 3 on the Billboard Pop Chart. It also topped the charts in several countries around the globe, an unprecedented achievement at the time. CMT ranks \"Rose Garden\" at No. 83 on its list of the \"100 Greatest Songs in Country Music History\".

	dbo:abstract	"Mark William Lanegan (born November 25, 1964) is an American alternative rock musician and singer-songwriter. Born and raised in Ellensburg, Washington, Lanegan began his musical career in 1984, forming the grunge band Screaming Trees with Gary Lee Conner, Van Conner and Mark Pickerel. During his time in the band, Lanegan also started a low-key solo career and released his first solo studio album, The Winding Sheet, in 1990. Since 1990, he has released a further six studio albums and has received critical recognition and moderate commercial success. Lanegan has also collaborated with various artists and bands throughout his career, including with Kurt Cobain of Nirvana prior to the group's breakout success with their album, Nevermind, recording an unreleased album of songs by the blues singer, Lead Belly. Lanegan also performed with Layne Staley in the side band, Mad Season. It was intended that Lanegan was to take over vocals in Mad Season full-time after Staley declined to make a second album. Following the dissolution of The Screaming Trees in 2000, he became a member of Queens of the Stone Age and is featured on five of the band's albums\u2014Rated R (2000), Songs for the Deaf (2002), Lullabies to Paralyze (2005), Era Vulgaris (2007) and ...Like Clockwork (2013). Lanegan also formed The Gutter Twins with Greg Dulli in 2003, released three collaboration albums with former Belle and Sebastian singer Isobel Campbell, and contributed to releases by Melissa Auf der Maur, Martina Topley-Bird, Creature with the Atom Brain, Moby, Bomb the Bass, Soulsavers and Mad Season. Lanegan has a distinctive baritone voice that has been described \"as scratchy as a three-day beard yet as supple and pliable as moccasin leather\" and compared to Leonard Cohen and Tom Waits."@en ;

She won awards in national fiddle championships while still a teenager. Erwin is accomplished on several other instruments, including the mandolin, viola, double bass and guitar. She has written and co-written a number of the band's songs, some of which have become chart-topping hits. She also contributes her skills in vocal harmony and backing vocals, as well as orchestrating string arrangements for the band. Erwin learned several instruments at a young age, honing her skills with her younger sister, Emily Strayer (born Emily Erwin) and two schoolmates (a brother and sister team, Troy and Sharon Gilchrist) for over five years as a part of a touring bluegrass quartet while in high school. After graduation, the sisters forged an alliance with two other women they had met through the Dallas music scene, Laura Lynch and Robin Lynn Macy, forming a bluegrass and country music band, busking and touring the bluegrass festival circuits for six years. After the departure of Macy, and the replacement of Lynch with singer Natalie Maines, the band widened their musical repertoire and appearance. The result was a trio so commercially successful that it took the country music industry by surprise, with a number of hit songs, albums, and awards that have set records in the music industry. Erwin subsequently stood by her bandmates as they were engulfed in political controversy."@en ;

She is known for her soprano singing range and her country pop material. McBride was signed to RCA Records in 1991, and made her debut the following year as a neo-traditionalist country singer with the single, \"The Time Has Come\". Over time, she developed a pop-styled crossover sound, similar to that of Shania Twain and Faith Hill and has had a string of major hit singles on the Billboard country chart and occasionally on the adult contemporary chart. Five of these singles went to No. 1 on the country chart between 1995 and 2001, and one peaked at No. 1 on the adult contemporary chart in 2003. She has been called the \"Celine Dion of Country Music\" when she was recognized for her soprano singing range. McBride has recorded a total of 13 studio albums, two greatest hits compilations, one \"live\" album, as well as two additional compilation albums. Eight of her studio albums and two of her compilations have received an RIAA Gold certification, or higher. In the U.S. she has sold over 14 million albums. In addition, McBride has won the Country Music Association's \"Female Vocalist of the Year\" award four times (tied with Reba McEntire for the second-most wins) and the Academy of Country Music's \"Top Female Vocalist\" award three times.

Gaye helped to shape the sound of Motown in the 1960s, first as an in-house session player and later as a solo artist with a string of hits, including \"Ain't That Peculiar\", \"How Sweet It Is (To Be Loved By You)\" and \"I Heard It Through the Grapevine\", and duet recordings with Mary Wells, Kim Weston, Diana Ross and Tammi Terrell, later earning the titles \"Prince of Motown\" and \"Prince of Soul\". During the 1970s, he recorded the concept albums What's Going On and Let's Get It On and became one of the first artists in Motown to break away from the reins of their production company. Gaye's later recordings influenced several contemporary R&B subgenres, such as quiet storm and neo soul. Following a period in Europe as a tax exile in the early 1980s, Gaye released the 1982 Grammy Award-winning hit \"Sexual Healing\" and its parent album Midnight Love. On April 1, 1984, Gaye's father, Marvin Gay Sr., fatally shot him at their house in the West Adams district of Los Angeles.

Carpenter spent several years singing in Washington, D.C. clubs before signing in the late 1980s with Columbia Records, who marketed her as a country singer. Carpenter's first album, 1987's Hometown Girl, did not produce any singles, although 1989's State of the Heart and 1990's Shooting Straight in the Dark each produced four Top 20 hits on the Billboard country singles charts. Carpenter's most successful album to date remains 1992's Come On Come On, which yielded seven charting country singles and was certified quadruple platinum in the U.S. for sales exceeding four million copies. She followed it with Stones in the Road (1994) and A Place in the World (1996), which both featured hit singles. In the 2000s, Carpenter's albums departed both thematically and musically from her early work, becoming less radio-friendly and more focused on societal and political issues. In 2007, she released The Calling. She followed that with The Age of Miracles (2010), Ashes and Roses (2012) and the orchestral album, Songs From the Movie (2014). Carpenter has won five Grammy Awards and is the only artist to have won four consecutive Grammy Award for Best Female Country Vocal Performance, which she received from 1992 to 1995. As of 2005, she had sold more than 12 million records. On October 7, 2012, Mary Chapin Carpenter was inducted into the Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame. Carpenter has performed on television shows such as Late Night with David Letterman and Austin City Limits and on radio shows such as The Diane Rehm Show. She also tours frequently, returning to Washington almost every summer to perform at the popular outdoor venue Wolf Trap. She is a fifth cousin of the late Harry Chapin (along with his brothers Tom & Steve), \"Cat's in the Cradle\" singer and humanitarian."@en ;

Since 1999, Martin has written and co-written 22 Billboard Hot 100 number-one hits (most of which he has also produced or co-produced) in the United States, including Katy Perry's \"I Kissed a Girl\" (2008), Pink's \"So What\" (2008), Britney Spears's \"Hold It Against Me\" (2011), Maroon 5's \"One More Night\" (2012), and Taylor Swift's \"We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together\" (2012), \"Shake It Off\" (2014), \"Blank Space\" (2014), and \"Bad Blood\" (2015). Martin is the songwriter with the third-most number one singles on the chart, behind only Paul McCartney (32) and John Lennon (26). In 2016, Martin won the ASCAP Songwriter of the Year award for the sixth consecutive year and for the ninth time in his career. In 2014, Martin broke ahead of Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis and Dr. Luke to take the second-place position on the list of most number one hits for a producer, behind only George Martin, who had compiled 23 by the time of his death. In early 2013 his single sales were tallied by The Hollywood Reporter to be at over 135 million."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Megan Martha \"Meg\" White (born December 10, 1974) is an American drummer known for her work with Jack White in the Detroit rock duo The White Stripes. On an impulse, she played on Jack's drums in 1997. The two decided to form a band and began performing two months later, calling themselves The White Stripes because of their last name and Meg's preference for peppermint candy. The band quickly became a Detroit underground favorite, before reaching national, then international fame. White has been nominated for various awards as a part of the White Stripes, and has received four Grammy Awards. Her drumming style has been called \"primal\" for its simplicity, and drew both praise and criticism from fans and critics. Jack has been a vocal advocate for her playing, calling her critics sexist. Her musical influences are wide and varied, with Bob Dylan being her favorite artist. Meg calls herself \"very shy\", and has kept a very low public profile. Though publicly insisting they were siblings, public records emerged in 2001 that indicated that she and Jack were married in 1996, prior to the band's formation; they divorced in 2000, before The White Stripes ascended to international fame. In 2009, she married guitarist Jackson Smith, son of musicians Patti Smith and Fred \"Sonic\" Smith. They divorced in 2013. While on tour in support for The White Stripes' sixth studio album, Icky Thump, White suffered a bout of acute anxiety, and the remaining dates of the tour were cancelled. After a few public appearances, and a hiatus from recording, The White Stripes announced in February 2011 that they would be disbanding. White has not been active in the music industry since."@en ;

He co-founded Ipecac Recordings with Greg Werckman in 1999, and has run the label since. He is regarded as very hard-working.
