	dbo:abstract	"Jawbreaker was an American punk rock band active from 1986 to 1996. The band is considered one of the influential acts of the 1990s emo movement. Lead vocalist and guitarist Blake Schwarzenbach, bassist Chris Bauermeister, and drummer Adam Pfahler formed the band while students at New York University, later relocating to Los Angeles where they released their debut album Unfun (1990) through independent record label Shredder Records. Relocating again to San Francisco the following year, they released 1992's Bivouac through the Tupelo Recording Company and The Communion Label. Schwarzenbach's charisma and personal, frustrated lyrics helped to establish him as a cult idol, even as he underwent surgery to remove painful and voice-threatening polyps from his throat. Jawbreaker toured with Nirvana in 1993 and released 24 Hour Revenge Therapy in 1994, attracting the attention of major labels. They signed a $1 million contract with DGC Records and released 1995's Dear You, but the album's polished production and smooth vocals resulted in a significant backlash from the band's core audience. Internal tensions led to Jawbreaker's dissolution in 1996. Following the breakup, the members of Jawbreaker were active in other projects including Jets to Brazil and Whysall Lane. Pfahler continued to issue previously-recorded Jawbreaker material through his Blackball Records label, and public interest in the band continued due in part to nationally-charting pop punk and emo acts openly indebted to Jawbreaker's sound. In 2004, Pfahler licensed the out-of-print Dear You from DGC's parent company Geffen Records and re-released it to positive response. He has since issued a remastered version of Unfun, and plans to remaster the rest of the band's catalog."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Jimmy Vivino and the Basic Cable Band is the house band for Conan O'Brien's late-night talk show Conan which debuted on November 8, 2010. Guitarist and arranger Jimmy Vivino is the group's leader. The group was originally formed and led by drummer Max Weinberg in 1993, and played under the name The Max Weinberg 7 when it was the house band for Late Night with Conan O'Brien in New York through 2009. The band then played under Max Weinberg and The Tonight Show Band during their brief 2009\u20132010 stint on The Tonight Show with Conan O'Brien in Los Angeles. They were then briefly known as the The Legally Prohibited Band during their participation with O'Brien in the 2010 The Legally Prohibited from Being Funny on Television Tour. During The Max Weinberg 7 days, the band included Jimmy Vivino on guitar, Richie \"LaBamba\" Rosenberg on trombone, Scott Healy on keyboard, Mike Merritt on bass guitar, Mark \"Love Man\" Pender on trumpet and acoustic guitar, and Jimmy's older brother Jerry Vivino on woodwinds. When the group moved to Los Angeles to become The Tonight Show Band, they added an eighth member, James Wormworth, on percussion. Wormworth had often substituted as drummer when Weinberg toured with Bruce Springsteen as a member of the E Street Band, prior to being made a permanent fixture in the band; Jimmy Vivino had served as the band's leader during those periods. Weinberg did not participate in the Legally Prohibited Tour and his departure from the group and from O'Brien was made official in September 2010."@en ;

The group were mostly known as a five-piece, consisting of Robinson, Neville, Conlon, Abz Love and Jason \"J\" Brown. Five enjoyed remarkable success worldwide, particularly in the United Kingdom, most of Europe, and Asia. The group have currently based on BPI certifications sold a minimum of 1.6 million albums and 2 million singles in the UK alone.

Robinson, Love, Neville, and Brown briefly reformed the group without Conlon (who departed before their 2001 split) in September 2006, with a new management team headed by music manager Richard Beck. Eight months later, having secured a lucrative tour but failing to gain enough record company interest, Five made an announcement via their official website that they would again disband. In 2012, the group announced that they were planning another reunion, this time with Conlon on board. Lead singer Brown initially agreed to take part in the reunion, but later changed his mind, claiming that he no longer wanted to be in the public eye. The group continued with only four members, but decided to keep the name Five. Alongside Blue, 911, Atomic Kitten, B*Witched, Honeyz and Liberty X, Five were featured in the ITV2 documentary series The Big Reunion, which began airing on 31 January 2013. This was followed by a comeback performance at the Hammersmith Apollo on 26 February 2013 and an arena tour around the UK and Ireland in May, which was their first ever tour without Brown.

The band were influenced by the chirpy sound of British 80s pop groups like Haircut One Hundred, Exhibit B, The Style Council and Aztec Camera, as well as the fashionably eclectic sounds of early 90s Britain, from alternative dance to acid jazz. The sonic experimentation of Brian Wilson was also evident in some tracks. The group were an important part of the Tokyo Shibuya-kei scene in the late 1980s to early 1990s, and Oyamada went on to produce work for Pizzicato Five and his close friend Kahimi Karie. The band shows their influence on their sleeves, and their song titles often cited their British artists' influence \u2014 Goodbye Our Pastels Badges, Haircut One Hundred, The Colourfield. Following the demise of the band in 1991, the two members pursued solo careers. Ozawa released the album The Dogs Bark But The Caravan Moves On under his own name, and Oyamada began recording under the name of Cornelius.

The band consisted of Simonon on bass, American musician Gary Myrick on guitar, Nigel Dixon from the British band Whirlwind on lead vocals, and Travis Williams, a drummer who they found by a newspaper announcement. In essence, it was a rockabilly band with a heavy Latino and reggae influence. The band recorded a self-titled album in Japan in 1991. The album, which has twelve original tracks, received solid reviews and had in \"Reach the Rock\" a minor radio hit. Following Dixon's death on 3 April 1993 and departure of Simonon who moved on to a career of art, Myrick put out one more album with different line-up but it was also unsuccessful and the band broke up shortly after. The band took their name from the title of a 1950s album by Perez Prado."@en ;

Members originally included former Tokyo Blade singer Vick Wright (Vicki James Wright), former Champaign guitarists Christopher Stewart and August Worchell, bassist Andy Rogers, and former Rock City Angels drummer Stephen \"Punkee\" Adamo. Their sound was likened to that of AC/DC and contemporaries Junkyard, Rhino Bucket and The Four Horsemen. In 1990, the band released their first album, Neighbourhood Threat, featuring Vicki James Wright (vocals), August Worchell (guitar and backing vocals), Christopher Stewart (guitar and backing vocals), Stephen \"Punky\" Adamo (drums) and Terry Nails (Tommy Tutone, Steve Jones, Ozzy Osbourne) (bass). The band, with Andy Rogers on bass, toured for a short time with bands such as M\u00F6tley Cr\u00FCe and Pretty Maids. The single \"Hey Kid\" became a minor hit and its video received some rotation on MTV Guitarist J.J. Bolt and then-future Guns N' Roses members Dizzy Reed and Matt Sorum joined the band to replace Worchell and Adamo. However, before the second album could be released Johnny Crash were dropped by their record label, and Chris suggested moving to Europe. Vicki disagreed and the band split up. In 1992, bassist Andy Rogers died of a heroin overdose. In 2007, an interview with Vicki James Wright stated that the then unreleased album, now titled Unfinished Business, will come out on Suncity Records sometime \"soon\".In 2008, Unfinished Business was released on Suncity Records. Vicki James Wright has since gone back to his original name, Vick Wright. He released his first novel titled South of the Pole through midnightpressbooks.com in 2007."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"June of 44 was an American rock band which was formed in 1994 from ex-members of Rodan, Lungfish, Rex, and Hoover. The band's music is often described as 'boat rock'. The band's name refers to the period during which writers Henry Miller and Ana\u00EFs Nin corresponded. The band toured extensively and reached as far as Australia. Often referred to as the punk rock pirates of the math rock world, June of 44 were a collective from 1994\u20132000. All the members were living in different cities at the time. This seminal band created music that ranged from experimental jazz to ambient dub to angular post punk. Debut album Engine Takes to the Water (1995) drew comparisons with both Slint and Will Oldham. The following year's Tropics and Meridians saw the band compared to Tortoise and The For Carnation. Drummer Doug Scharin had started HiM as a side project, which sometimes also featured bassist Fred Erskine, and Scharin also later started the avant-garde band Out in Worship. Meadows also had a side project, forming Sonora Pine with Tara Jane O'Neill. June of 44 released three further albums, incorporating more electronics and jazz influences, before the band split up in 1999, with vocalist/guitarist Jeff Mueller forming Shipping News and vocalist Sean Meadows forming Everlasting the Way and later Letter E. Erskine joined Abilene, while Scharin continued with HiM, also guesting with several other bands."@en ;

Petersen's lyrics often pay homage to American labor radicalism of the early 20th century. Mischief Brew has released albums and EPs on many different labels, notably Art of the Underground, Gunner Records, and Fistolo Records. In support of these records, Mischief Brew has toured extensively throughout the United States and Europe.

(Russian Association of Independent Genres) label. Members of the band also play in nationally acclaimed professional hardcore bands Kirpichi and I.F.K. Won James Won musical approach combines noisy rock-instrumentations, sampled electronics, wild vocalizations, ambiguous texts and eccentric shows. The group released their debut LP Tol's Toy in 2004 and the second studio album Theorist Attack in 2006. Both albums represent the wild array of styles and sonic methods. In 2005 they released a live auto-bootleg \"The Drisneyland Chronicles Vol.I\". In Spring 2007 the core band members composed an ambient soundtrack \"Dante. Moscow\" for a photo installation based on Dante\u2019s \u201CDivine Comedy\u201D (released as a digital file in 2008). In November 2007 the third official album for RAIG entitled \"The Hollow Grail\" came out. It consisted of live material and marked the return to more abrasive noise imrov direction. Next came \"The Flood of Ixtlan\" EP, 30-minute amalgamation of different styles, from IDM to micronoise and freak-folk. A year later, a collection of studio outtakes, live cuts and other rarities, \"Les 120 Minuetes de Sadomasonodoraemonocuporamenosodom\" was also made available for download on RAIG affiliated net-label Accessory Takes. While this record included mostly song-oriented tracks in noise-rock vein, next studio album by Won James Won entitled \"Corpus Unhearmeticum\" operates in collage, musique concr\u00E8te and dark ambient aesthetics. Artwork for the strictly limited edition of this CD courtesy of ZonderZond is especially ambitious. In 2011 the band delved deeper into field recordings/plunderphonics territory with self-released \"Homeostat EP\". Sounds incorporated in this work were sampled in variety of abandoned factories and wild forests in rural Russia. Next EP was called \"\u0413\u0415\u041D\u0428\u0422\u0410\u0411 \u0414\u0415\u0421\u0411\u041E\u0422\" - a grim-sounding foray into dark ambient electronics.

Won James Won are members of ZveZdaZ art-movement. The band is considered as one of the most prolific on Russian underground scene. Their albums were distributed by such well-known underground labels as Cold Spring (U.K.), Amanita (France) and Crucial Blast (US)."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Alpha 606, (born Armando Martinez on November 15, 1974 in Hialeah, Florida, U.S.), is an acoustic/electronic artist based out of Miami. The group was founded by Armando Martinez and Rey Rubio in 1998. Martinez is a programmer/composer and Rubio is a performing sound engineer. \"Rubio and Martinez ensure that the drums don't 'sit on top' of the track, instead processing the rhythms so that they're subsumed into the rest of it, forming an elastic foundation.\" The group was joined by two percussionists in 2003, Marino Hernandez and Danny Chirino. \"The music itself... is a futuristic homage to Cuban culture, fusing warm machine tones and crisp bass notes with Afro-Cuban drums.\" Their debut ep, Computer Controlled, was released on Dopamine Records in 2004. [Here] \"US duo reveals there in three cuts its immoderate taste for a dancefloor minimal electro of a high quality, at once percussive, futuristic, heading and fresh.\" The group played a few live shows as four, but shortly thereafter parted ways. Armando has continued touring and performing as Alpha 606 since 2004 with his solo laptop sets. Alpha 606 live shows have been recorded in Barcelona, London, Brussels, Helsinki, Bournemouth, Birmingham and Miami. Alpha 606 has since then been released on Interdimensional Transmissions and Touchin' Bass."@en ;

Weilerstein formed the group that summer at the Marlboro Music School and Festival with violinist Peter Salaff, violist Martha Strongin Katz, and cellist Paul Katz. The group was initially called the \"New Cleveland Quartet.\" In 1971, the group left the Cleveland Institute because of disagreements over teaching loads and took up residency at the University at Buffalo, The State University of New York; they dropped the word \"New\" from their name at this time. In 1976 they made their final change of residency, moving to the Eastman School of Music in Rochester, New York. The quartet had three personnel changes: violist Atar Arad replaced Strongin Katz in 1980; violist James Dunham then replaced Arad in 1987; and William Preucil replaced Weilerstein as first violin in 1989. The quartet disbanded in 1995. Preucil became concertmaster of the Cleveland Orchestra, a position he still holds. Paul Katz, Martha Strongin Katz and Donald Weilerstein are on the faculty of the New England Conservatory of Music, and Weilerstein performs in a trio with his wife Vivian Hornik Weilerstein and his daughter, cellist Alisa Weilerstein; Peter Salaff is on the faculty of the Cleveland Institute of Music; Atar Arad teaches at the Jacobs School of Music at Indiana University; and James Dunham teaches at the Shepherd School of Music at Rice University. The quartet has an extensive discography with RCA Red Seal and the Cleveland-based label Telarc."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"During an exchange project in Vancouver, David Pino, singer of Wiseguy, met two Canadians who introduced him to alternative country. In exchange for a six-pack of beer and a tank full of gasoline, Pino obtained an acoustic guitar. Together with his Canadian accomplices, he traveled across the country playing for cash or free beers. Back in the Netherlands, he brought together like-minded musicians, and El Pino & the Volunteers was born. The band got together only every once in a while, and concerts were held on an incidental basis. After a couple of months of playing, the band started to become more serious. This newfound professionalism was solidified with the band\u2019s first EP Cougar. It was released in May 2005 by the small record label Stardumb. The EP sold out in no-time and received much praise in the Dutch music press. In December 2005, MTV aired a special on the band in its Brand New show. Pino decided to leave his main band Wiseguy to focus completely on El Pino & the Volunteers. In early 2006, the band was invited to the prestigious Noorderslag festival in Groningen. The press was enthusiastic, and praised the band for its musicianship(de Volkskrant). Dutch Excelsior Recordings, home of Johan, Daryll-Ann and GEM, signed the band immediately. El Pino & the Volunteers played at Club 3voor12 that February, recorded an Apers song for a tribute album in March, and performed at Motel Mozaique in April. And, in May, the band performed at the 10th anniversary party of Excelsior Recordings, together with several of their labelmates. In May and June the band recorded 16 tracks for its debut album, which Reyn Ouwehand produced. On August 31, the album, named Molten City, was presented in Rotown in Rotterdam. The album was received well by the music press, becoming album of the week at 3voor12 (link). In September and October the band supported Johan during their Dutch club tour. The band rounded out the year by performing at the Fine Fine Music tour in December 2006. The next record, also produced by Reyn Ouwehand, was released November 16, 2009."@en ;

The group was formed by brothers H\u00E9ctor and Oscar Serrano together with Edwin Serrano and Alfred Cotto in the early 1990s. In 1994, Edwin Serrano was replaced by Elvis Crespo before releasing their most successful albums. In 1997, Crespo decided to leave the group and follow a solo career. He was replaced in 1998 with Reynaldo Santiago, who had previously sung with Zona Roja, another popular merengue band at the time. The band has achieved gold status with some of their albums and are considered one of the best in the genre. At the beginning of the millennium, the band faced some controversy when H\u00E9ctor Serrano, the group director, fired Cotto and Santiago on the grounds of alleged discipline problems. Cotto and Santiago would go on to form Grupo Starz, while Serrano replaced them with Alex Rivera and Juan Luis Guzm\u00E1n. Despite never having the same amount of success as previous years, the band continued to perform and record albums. However, in 2006, Serrano announced the group would go on a reunion tour entitled \"The Originals\" with former members, Elvis Crespo and Alfred Cotto. After three years of inactivity, Grupo Mania released \"15 A\u00F1os de Corazon\" in late 2008. Oscar Serrano is resigning from Grupo Mania after twenty-two years to pursue a solo career.

	dbo:abstract	"Habana Abierta is a Cuban band. They are a member of a generation of composers, musicians, sculptors, authors, actors, etc. which emerged in the early 90s with its own identity in Havana, even though some of their creations had already been well known for some years in the island's cultural circles. The origins of Habana Abierta go back to a personal project of music duo Gema y P\u00E1vel, who wanted to produce a compilation of everything they and their peers had been doing in Havana clubs with hardly any resources. Initially, Luis Alberto Barber\u00EDa, Pepe del Valle, Carlos Santos, Boris Larramendi, Superavit, Andy Villal\u00F3n, Kelvis Ochoa and Jos\u00E9 Luis Medina, backed by the NUBENEGRA recording label, gave us a first glimpse released under the name Habana Oculta. In July 1996 most of them travelled to Spain (except for Carlos Santos, Ra\u00FAl Ciro and Alejandro Fr\u00F3meta: Super\u00E1vit) to showcase their music at several festivals and clubs, and very soon spurred interest among audiences and the media alike, and even well-known Spanish artists and musicians. Ana Bel\u00E9n and V\u00EDctor Manuel, along with Ketama, were the first to show an interest and to take the initiative in a gradual and rich exchange with our Habana Abierta, which whom they made music in Spain. BMG Ariola asked Gema y P\u00E1vel to come up with a project bringing a group of highly different singer-songwriters together on the album, based on the individuality of each member yet with combined expression of the diverse unity of Cuban music. Then Vanito Brown and Alejandro Guti\u00E9rrez joined what was to become Habana Abierta, recording a new album under this name. They played over 80 gigs throughout Spain in 1997, 50 of them in Madrid and in 1998 recorded am album with the line-up down to 6, as Andy and Barber\u00EDa had left to branch out on their own. With 24 Horas, the second album with Habana Abierta, an eclectic line was followed with some tracks from previous recordings, with a more defined fusion between popular Cuban music and funk, reggae and hip-hop. Rock and Pop Cuban-style with national roots: Van Van by Juan Fromel, Irakere by Chucho Vald\u00E9s or NG la Banda by Jos\u00E9 Luis Cort\u00E9s, refrains attributed to Matamoros over Red Hot Chili Peppers or Rolling Stones riffs. Conga-funk, timba-rock, bolero-hop, chachacha-blues, son and pop.... In January 2003, after six years in Spain, they returned to Cuba for a series of sell-out individual shows, with a performance by the Habana Abierta full line-up at La Tropical, playing to with over 10,000 people. This gave rise to the Habana Abierta documentary directed by Jorge Perugorr\u00EDa and Arturo Soto, which was presented at several film festivals."@en ;

In 2006 came out their first album, entitled \"You Go!: We Are Maria\", but their popularity really came to raise after \"Tsubomi\" single release. In 2008, though, Maria came out with their first DVD, featuring a live tour for the first album, and was entitled \"Maria Live Tour - We Are Maria 2007\", which reached the height of 30th place in Oricon parade. Maria disbanded in 2010 due to Tattsu's thoracic outlet syndrome, which made it impossible for her to continue playing.

The group currently comprises Rob Thomas (lead vocals, piano, rhythm guitar), Brian Yale (bass), and Paul Doucette (lead and rhythm guitar, drums, backing vocals). Matchbox Twenty rose to international fame with their debut album, Yourself or Someone Like You (1996), which was certified 12\u00D7 Platinum (diamond) in the United States and multi-platinum in Australia, Canada and New Zealand. Their second album, Mad Season, released in 2000, charted in the top three on the Billboard 200 and was certified 4\u00D7 Platinum in the United States. Their third album, More Than You Think You Are, released in 2002, was only certified 2x Platinum in the United States, despite its singles receiving significant airplay. Director Bill Draheim documented the band throughout the process while making More Than You Think You Are. The documentary \"Theresville\" was an online extra. The band then went on hiatus in 2004, with rhythm guitarist Adam Gaynor leaving the band in 2005 after performing on the first three studio albums. As a result, Paul Doucette took over rhythm guitar, and the band reunited and released a compilation album, Exile on Mainstream, in 2007, which was certified Gold in the United States. After the release, former Push Stars drummer Ryan MacMillan filled Doucette's vacated drum spot. During this period, Rob Thomas embarked on a successful solo career. Matchbox Twenty then took another hiatus, but reunited again in 2010. The band released North, their fourth album, on September 4, 2012 which made its debut at number one on the Billboard 200."@en ;

The group was founded in 1989 through the assistance of record producer Tony Brown. McBride & the Ride's first three albums \u2014 Burnin' Up the Road, the gold-certified Sacred Ground, and Hurry Sundown, released in 1991, 1992, and 1993, respectively \u2014 were all issued on MCA Nashville. These albums also produced several hits on the Billboard country charts, including the Top 5 hits \"Sacred Ground\" (their highest-peaking, at number 2), \"Going Out of My Mind\", \"Just One Night\", and \"Love on the Loose, Heart on the Run\". In 1994, the label removed Herndon and Thomas from the group, which was renamed Terry McBride & the Ride. McBride remained lead singer, while the other members were replaced with Keith Edwards (drums), Kenny Vaughan (electric guitar), Gary Morse (steel guitar), Jeff Roach (keyboards), and Randy Frazier (bass guitar), who had formerly been a member of the band Palomino Road. Roach and Vaughan were respectively replaced by Rick Gerken and Bob Britt shortly before their fourth album (1994's Terry McBride & the Ride), after which McBride & the Ride disbanded. During the hiatus, MCA issued a compilation called Country's Best, while McBride and Herndon wrote singles for other artists. McBride, Thomas, and Herndon reunited as McBride & the Ride in 2000, releasing Amarillo Sky on Dualtone Records in 2002 before splitting up again. McBride then joined the backing band for the duo Brooks & Dunn, and co-wrote several of the duo's singles, while Herndon self-released a solo album."@en ;

In late 2003, after OneRepublic played shows throughout the Los Angeles area, a number of record labels approached the band with interest, but OneRepublic ultimately signed with Velvet Hammer, an imprint of Columbia Records. They made their first album with producer Greg Wells during the summer and fall of 2005 at his studio, Rocket Carousel, in Culver City, California. The album was originally scheduled for release on June 6, 2006, but the group was dropped by Columbia two months before the album ever came out. The lead single of that album, \"Apologize\", was released on April 30, 2006 on Myspace and received some recognition there, becoming number one on the Myspace charts. In 2007, OneRepublic released their debut album, Dreaming Out Loud. Its lead single, \"Apologize\", was notably remixed by Timbaland, becoming a huge international success, reaching number one in sixteen countries and subsequently earning them a Grammy Award nomination. The second single, \"Stop and Stare\", mirrored its predecessor's success. The album was later certified Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). The band's second album, Waking Up (2009), produced the singles \"All the Right Moves\", \"Secrets\", \"Marchin On\", and \"Good Life\", with the latter reaching the top ten of the US Billboard Hot 100. OneRepublic's third album, Native (2013), became the band's first top ten album on the Billboard 200, and highest charting album to date, charting at number four. The lead single, \"If I Lose Myself\", charted within the top ten in several countries, while the album's third single, \"Counting Stars\", became the band's most successful single in recent years, obtaining top five placements in Australia, Canada, Germany, Ireland, New Zealand, the U.S. and the UK. This marks their highest charting single in the United Kingdom to date. It has also peaked at number 2 on the US Billboard Hot 100, matching their highest peak of \"Apologize\" in 2007. On October 7, 2016, OneRepublic released Oh My My, their fourth studio album, which featured a variety of guests. It was recognized as a change in their sound and was supported by the singles \"Wherever I Go\" and \"Kids\". On October 16, 2016, One Republic appeared live on ITV's X-Factor's results show."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Pointed Sticks are a Canadian punk rock/new wave band from Vancouver. Originally active from 1978 to 1981, then reuniting to perform in July 2006 through to November 2012. After a three-year hiatus, Pointed Sticks returned to the stage in June 2015 for shows on Vancouver island as well as the July 11th Khatsahlano street party in Vancouver (sporadic live appearances have continued into 2016). The band is known for their fast melodic pop music and liberal use of harmony singing by all five members\u2014also for unusual graphic images that acted as counterpoint to the music. They were the first Canadian band signed to Stiff Records, although the label was going through financial problems and never released an album by the band. The original band consisted of vocalist Nick Jones, guitarist Bill Napier-Hemy, bassist Tony Bardach and drummer Ian Tiles. Keyboard player Gord Nicholl joined soon after. Johnny Ferreira later joined on saxophone, Bardach was replaced by Scott Watson on bass, and Tiles was replaced by drummer Robert Bruce (from Active Dog), and later by Ken \"Dimwit\" Montgomery (who was also known for stints in the Subhumans and D.O.A.). The band released four singles, (including their only Stiff records release, a 3 song 7\") before releasing their first full-length album, Perfect Youth in 1980. Members of the band were featured in Dennis Hopper's 1980 film, Out of the Blue. The first compilation of their recordings was released in 1995 on Zulu Records. \"Part Of The Noise\", now out of print, included five songs from the \"Perfect Youth\" album as well as 45's and rarities. In 2005, the complete Perfect Youth album, with 4 bonus tracks, was reissued by Sudden Death Records, followed the next year by a compilation of singles, outtakes, and other rarities, entitled Waiting for the Real Thing also on Sudden Death. These two releases do not share or repeat any tracks. The original band members reunited in 2006 for a tour of Japan, and then continued to play sporadic concerts in Canada and the United States. In 2009 the band recorded an album of all new material,\"Three Lefts Make A Right\", released Nov.1 of that year on Northern Electric records. The band returned to Japan in August 2010 with support from a re-united \"Dishrags\", their all female contemporaries from the original Vancouver Punk scene. Pointed Sticks participated in a Vancouver benefit concert for Japan earthquake relief May 12, 2011. \"Three Lefts Make a Right\" was mixed by Vancouver's Mike Fraser. The complete \"Stiff Sessions\" recordings were released on CD in Japan in 2008, on the Base label. A third full-length album simply titled \"Pointed Sticks\" is available (as of June 15, 2015) on the Northern Electric label via Sudden Death Distribution."@en ;

Singer Jon Anderson left Yes as he felt increasingly constrained by their commercial and pop-oriented direction in the 1980s. He began an album with one of the band's line-ups from the 1970s with guitarist Steve Howe, keyboardist Rick Wakeman, and drummer Bill Bruford, who invited Tony Levin to play bass. The group released their sole studio album, Anderson Bruford Wakeman Howe, in June 1989 which reached number 14 in the UK and number 30 in the US. Their 1989\u201390 world tour was well-received and spawned two live albums, An Evening of Yes Music Plus (1993) and Live at the NEC (2012). In 1990, tracks for a second studio album were included with songs recorded by Yes to make the thirteenth Yes album, Union (1991). This marked the end of Anderson Bruford Wakeman Howe and the start of the eight-member Yes formation until 1992, comprising Anderson Bruford Wakeman Howe and Yes musicians Chris Squire, Trevor Rabin, Tony Kaye, and Alan White."@en ;

	foaf:name	"Bickley"@en ;
	dbo:abstract	"Bickley was a punk rock band from Houston, Texas from 1995 until 2001. The band's name is a word derived from Robert De Niro's character in Taxi Driver, Travis Bickle. Influenced primarily by the likes of The Vindictives, The Queers and Screeching Weasel, Bickley delivered a simple yet powerful sound. Bickley's first full-length studio recording was Pogo Au Go-Go (PaperDoll), a full-length CD issued in 1996. They quickly developed a loyal following in the Houston, Texas area. By 1998, Bickley had been picked up by Fearless Records, and the Pogo Au Go-Go CD was re-released under that label. In late 1998, Bickley released their second CD Kiss The Bunny, also on Fearless records. By this time their fan base extended across the US, and they often toured the Southwest US region, with short stints across the West Coast, East Coast, and the Deep South. Bickley's final release Fat, Drunk and Stupid captured their raucous live show at their favorite venue, Fitzgerald's, in Houston Texas. Fat, Drunk and Stupid was released in August 2001 through PaperDoll Records. Bickley were also noted by the music press for the adult content of their songs, and the unique character of lead singer Ben Fondled's voice. Bickley's core lineup (singer Ben Fondled, guitarist Uncle Dig, and drummer Dave Wreckoning) did not change from the time of their 1998 re-release under Fearless Records. Bickley switched between two bass players in the 1998-2001 period, driven by the availability of the players: Rubio Coconut (from the successful Houston punk rock band, 30 Foot Fall) and Bill Fool. Rubio began touring the country with 30footFALL and Bill was brought in to replace him in late 1997. Matte Finish was the original drummer for the band, and is the drummer on the Down the Hatch 7\", on Pogo Au Go-Go, and on some songs that appeared on Kiss the Bunny. In 2001, at the peak of their popularity, Bickley split up citing the need for more personal time with their respective families. The band has reunited at various times since August 2001 for special benefit and reunion shows. Bickley (including both Rubio Coconut on bass and Bill Fool on rhythm guitar) recently reunited for one night on July 20, 2013 at Fitzgerald's in Houston, TX for 30footFALL's 20th anniversary show. They re-released Down The Hatch on vinyl and released a greatest hits album entitled, \"Good To See You Again, Asshole!\", which includes 20 tracks of fan favorites from the band's two studio albums. Bickley will play another one off show with the 5 member lineup, again at Fitzgerald's. This show will be to celebrate their 20th anniversary, and will be supported by Dead To The World, O'Doyle Rules, and The Velostacks. They also played at 30footFALL's annual Christmas Show in December."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Gratitude was formed in 2003 by Mark Weinberg (originally of the band Crumb) and Thomas Becker (originally of the Get Up Kids). Initially called the Collision, the band was joined by Bob Lindsey on bass and Robby Cronholm (also formerly of Crumb) on vocals. After touring in 2002 with New End Original, which featured Far alum Jonah Matranga and Jeremy Tappero, Cronholm left the band and was replaced by Matranga. When Matranga joined, the band changed their name from the Collision to Gratitude. After picking up Matranga and changing their name, Gratitude signed to Atlantic Records. The group picked up Tappero as second guitarist before going into the studio. After Becker left the band in the middle of recording the record, Drummer David Jarnstrom joined the band before the release of their self-titled debut album (Becker and other session musicians fulfilled the drum role during the recording of the album). Atlantic Records released Gratitude on March 8, 2005. The tracks Drive Away and This Is the Part, were released as singles and received significant radio play both in the US and the UK. Gratitude's first tour for the album was a North American tour supporting Jimmy Eat World (to whom the band has often been compared), and they were also on the bill for the 2005 Warped Tour and a leg of the 2005 Taste of Chaos. The band faced many difficulties after their album's release\u2014the commercial response was somewhat poor, and Weinberg left the band in June for personal reasons, thus forcing Gratitude to continue touring as a four-piece. Many show cancellations throughout the second half of 2005 and rumors of the band being dropped by Atlantic put the future of the band at stake. Eventually Gratitude released a statement on November 25, 2005 claiming that they had in fact decided to split after playing one final show at the Ascot Room in Minneapolis two days earlier. The members of Gratitude have now gone onto to various things, with frontman Jonah Matranga continuing with his solo work. Members, Jeremy Tappero & David Jarnstrom have returned to their other band, Minneapolis rockers, Attention. In March 2007, bassist Robert Lindsey also joined Tappero and Jarnstrom in Attention. Mark Weinberg has gone on to become a producer and writer. Former drummer Thomas Becker went to Harvard Law School and became a human rights lawyer. He currently plays in The Beautiful Bodies."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"The Mills Blue Rhythm Band was an American big band of the 1930s. The band was formed in Harlem in 1930, with reedman Bingie Madison the first of its many leaders. It started life as the Coconut Grove Orchestra, changing to Mills Blue Rhythm Band when Irving Mills became its manager in 1931. At various times the same group was known as the \"Blue Rhythm Band\", \"Blue Ribbon Band\", \"Blue Rhythm Boys\", \"The Blue Racketeers\", \"Earl Jackson's Musical Champions\", \"Earl Jackson and his Orchestra\", \"Duke Wilson and his Ten Blackberries\", \"King Carter's Royal Orchestra\", \"Mills Music Masters\", \"Harlem Hot Shots\" and uncredited playing behind Louis Armstrong. The Mills Blue Rhythm Band were based at The Cotton Club in Manhattan. They worked steadily through the 1930s deputizing for the Duke Ellington and Cab Calloway Orchestras; often taking their undesirable engagements. Violinist Carroll Dickerson briefly fronted the band, followed by Drummer Willie Lynch in 1931 and then compere Jimmy Ferguson (Baron Lee). Edgar Hayes, Eddie Mallory and Dave Nelson all had temporary stints as band leader until Lucky Millinder permanently took over the role in 1934. The band recorded 150 sides for a variety of labels including Brunswick, Columbia, Victor, the ARC stable of labels (including Oriole, Perfect, Regal, Romeo, Banner, Melotone, Domino), Variety, and Vocalion. Despite success with a few hit records (including \"Truckin'\" and \"Ride, Red, Ride\") and a strong lineup of talented soloists, the group never attained the prominence of their peers. This is often attributed to the lack of a single identifiable leader, and Irving Mills' preference to have the band perform an understudy role. The group disbanded in 1938. Millinder joined Bill Doggett's band before reforming it into his own orchestra in 1940 Irving Mills revived the Mills Blue Rhythm Band name for two recording sessions in 1947 under the guidance of Van Alexander. The only original band member at either of the 1947 sessions was trumpeter Charlie Shavers. Many of the Mills Blue Rhythm Band's recordings are now considered jazz classics by collectors. Original records regularly appear on auction lists, and recent reissue and remastering projects have made their recordings more widely available."@en ;

Formed in Seattle, Washington in 1988 following the demise of Green River, Mudhoney's members are singer and rhythm guitarist Mark Arm, lead guitarist Steve Turner, bassist Guy Maddison and drummer Dan Peters. Original bassist Matt Lukin left the band in 1999. Mudhoney's early releases on the Sub Pop label, particularly their debut single \"Touch Me I'm Sick\" and the Superfuzz Bigmuff EP, were massively influential on the Seattle music scene. More than almost any other release of the era they inspired the dirty, high-distortion sound that would become grunge. Later on, Mudhoney also mixed heavy blues rock and punk rock into their sound at various stages. Although the band has found little commercial success during its long career, which has yielded 10 studio albums, it has inspired countless grunge and alternative rock musicians."@en ;

A friend, Oliver Smallman, heard the song and thought it was too good to be a one-off novelty song and encouraged Elson to put together a band and record more material. The first single did reasonably well, however the two follow-up singles did not fare so well as this is highlighted and detailed in the sleeve notes of their only album which was released in 2007 several years after the band stopped performing.

	dbo:abstract	"Killdozer was an American noise rock band, formed in Madison, Wisconsin in 1983, with members Bill Hobson, Dan Hobson and Michael Gerald. They took their name from the 1974 TV movie, directed by Jerry London, itself based on a Theodore Sturgeon short story. They released their first album, Intellectuals are the Shoeshine Boys of the Ruling Elite, in the same year. The band split in 1990 but reformed in 1993, losing guitarist Bill Hobson and gaining Paul Zagoras, and continued until they split up in 1996. Their farewell tour was officially titled \"Fuck You, We Quit!\", and included Erik Tunison of Die Kreuzen in place of Dan Hobson on drums and Jeff Ditzenberger on additional guitar. The band released nine albums, including a post-breakup live CD, The Last Waltz. Killdozer was notable for its slow, grinding song structures and blackly humorous lyrics, growled ominously by singer/guitarist Michael Gerald at the top of his lungs. Many of their songs were disturbing narratives of small-town life gone awry, and later had a jaded, left wing political perspective. Killdozer is regarded by many to have helped set the foundation for grunge music, despite that genre's association with the city of Seattle. The band also became famous for its cover songs, an example being Don McLean's \"American Pie\". A version exists on their 1989 all-covers album For Ladies Only. Gerald also did a cover of Jessi Colter's \"I'm Not Lisa\" for the band's 1986 EP Burl, dedicated \"in loving memory of\" the still-living-at-the-time Burl Ives. The EP in its entirety can be found on the CD version of their 1994 album Uncompromising War on Art Under the Dictatorship of the Proletariat."@en ;

Upon their development, Dance Gavin Dance released their debut EP, Whatever I Say Is Royal Ocean in 2006 and signed to Rise Records thereafter. The band released their full-length debut studio album, Downtown Battle Mountain, in May 2007, which spawned the singles \"And I Told Them I Invented Times New Roman\" and \"Lemon Meringue Tie\". Throughout 2008, the band's vocalist Jonny Craig and guitarist Sean O'Sullivan left the band and were replaced by vocalist Kurt Travis (also from A Lot Like Birds) and guitarist Zac Garren. The band released their second full-length album, Dance Gavin Dance, in August. The album peaked at No. 172 on the U.S. Billboard 200 chart and No. 26 on the Top Independent Albums chart. Vocalist Jon Mess and bass guitarist Eric Lodge left the band before the album's release. Bassist Jason Ellis replaced Lodge. Happiness was released as the band's third studio album in June 2009, peaking at No. 145 on the Billboard 200 Albums chart and No. 30 on the Top Independent Albums chart and is the group's first release in which guitarist Will Swan pursued screaming vocals along with guitar parts for an album.

It is led by singer, songwriter and pastor Ana Paula Valad\u00E3o. The group became popular in Brazil after the release of their first work, the disc Diante do Trono 1998. However, it was the albums \u00C1guas Purificadoras and Preciso de Ti that gained them international recognition, turning them into the main worship ministry in Latin America and one of the most successful in Brazilian music. In one presentation, held in 2003 during the recording of the album Quero Me Apaixonar, Diante do Trono gathered about 2 million people. The band has won trophies for Talent and Promise, and was also nominated for a Latin Grammy in 2012 with the Sol da Justi\u00E7a work. Diante do Trono has sold over 15 million records in various formats, one of the record holders of record sales in Brazil. The band, from its inception had a brass orchestra and strings, has had several instrumental changes throughout its career, especially the period of the years 2008 and 2010, when the only members that remained from the initial training group were Ana Paula Valad\u00E3o, vocalist and band leader, and Elias Fernandes, rhythm guitarist of the set. With the end of the orchestra the band's sound became noticeably more pop rock. The band's music is characterized by congregational singing and contemporary Christian music, with influences of pop rock, progressive rock and folk. The band had also created the Center for Ministerial Training Diante do Trono (CTMDT), a preparatory center for musicians and singers in the area of missions, as well as the Arts Factory, which in a partnership with the Lagoinha Baptist Church trains professionals in diverse areas such as singing, theater and dance, and has part of his discography devoted entirely to children. Diante do Trono participates in social projects, such as India Project, which collects and help Indian girls in prostitution, food donations to cities in the North of Minas Gerais in 2003, and a campaign of bone marrow donations in Barretos, during the recording of their thirteenth album in 2010."@en ;

However, they would soon develop their own musical style.

	dbo:abstract	"Deadly Venoms is a Wu-Tang Clan affiliated  all-female hip hop group formed in 1997 consisting of N-Tyce, J-Boo, Champ MC, and Finesse. X Clan-affiliated rapper Lin Que was initially intended to be part of the group but departed soon after its inception due to business decisions. Each member of the group were experienced rappers prior to joining the collective. Finesse recorded an album with rapper Synquis named Soul Sisters in 1988, Champ released her debut album Ghetto Flava on East West America/Atlantic Records, and N-Tyce was signed to Wild Pitch/EMI in the mid 1990s and released a few singles including the RZA-produced \"Hush Hush Tip\" featuring Method Man. The Deadly Venoms was J-Boo's professional introduction. A legal dispute with A&M/PolyGram Records and the then-forthcoming merger between the MCA and PolyGram families of labels that formed the Universal Music Group forced its debut album, Antidote, to remain in its vaults, although the single \u201COne More to Go\u201D (featuring Inspectah Deck, Method Man, Cappadonna, Street Life, and GZA) b/w \u201CBomb Threat,\u201D was released and the album was later leaked. Despite not being properly released, the album got positive reviews. The group was also featured on NBA All-Star and rapper Shaquille O'Neal's 1998 album Respect. Deadly Venoms' second album, Pretty Thugs, was also never properly released because of similar label disputes, this time with DreamWorks/Interscope/Universal Records. However, as with Antidote, copies of the record were leaked, and a promo CD was pressed. After the departure of Finesse due to undisclosed business reasons, the group finally managed to release an album with 2002's Still Standing, on Rocks the World/Caroline/Virgin/EMI Records."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"The Dharma Bums is a U.S. garage band. The band's members were Jim, John, Jeremy, and Eric. They named themselves after the Jack Kerouac book The Dharma Bums. They formed in 1987 in Portland, Oregon, by members of two local bands, The Watchmen and Perfect Circle (no connection with the later bands The Watchmen or A Perfect Circle). Their first album, Haywire, was produced by Scott McCaughey (lead singer of the Young Fresh Fellows) and recorded for the PopLlama label in 1989. McCaughey later played their debut to Frontier Records boss Lisa Fancher, who was impressed enough to re-release the album. One of the tracks, \"Boots of Leather\", proved to be an enduring college radio hit. In 1990 the more polished album Bliss was released on Frontier Records. Featuring greatly improved songwriting, this release covered subjects from rape and adolescence to suicide, in a mature fashion built on ragged rock textures. The Dharma Bums recorded their third and final album Welcome for the Tim/Kerr label in 1991, and disbanded in 1992. Wilson went on to form the alt-rock band Pilot. Many in the local Portland scene had expected the Dharma Bums to be a big breakthrough \"alternative\" act of the Northwest music scene, but Nirvana, a frequent opening act for the Dharma Bums, was to become the symbol of the genre instead. Some biographers, such as Melissa Rossi, author of Courtney Love: Queen of Noise (ISBN 0-671-00038-1), and Poppy Z Brite, author of Courtney Love: The Real Story, write that Courtney Love and Kurt Cobain first met each other at a Dharma Bums concert in Portland\u2014where Nirvana served as the opening act. However, Everett True argues in his book Nirvana: The Biography that while Kurt Cobain and Courtney Love did not meet for the first time at a Dharma Bums concert, it is possible that Courtney Love first saw Nirvana perform when they were the opening act for Dharma Bums at a performance at the Portland, Oregon, club Satyricon. In an interview with Fuse TV posted on YouTube on March 11, 2012, Courtney Love herself says, \"I met (Kurt) in 1988 at a Dharma Bums show.\""@en ;

Frontman Aljoscha Rompe, a Swiss living in East Berlin, supplied the vocals to the band's songs. His accompanying keyboardist and guitarist have since found fame as keyboardist Christian \"Flake\" Lorenz and rhythm-guitarist Paul Landers of Rammstein. Rammstein's singer, Till Lindemann, also participated once with Feeling B for the song \"Lied von der unruhevollen Jugend\" , for which he is credited on the album Hea Hoa Hoa Hea Hea Hoa. Rammstein twice played this song live in St. Petersburg and Moscow in 2001, during their 'Mutter' tour. The group disbanded mid 1990s. Bassist Christoph Zimmermann died in a plane crash in 1999. On special occasions, the band members would get together for individual concerts at punk festivals, until Rompe died in November 2000 of an asthma attack at 53 years old. Eventually, Flake rediscovered tapes of old and partial unreleased recordings. This unreleased material and remixes of some already known songs were released as Gr\u00FCn & Blau in 2007."@en ;

The \"Your Pain - Our Gain\" CD was meant to be released in 1996, but due to differences in opinion between the band and the record company (Energy Rekords) it was delayed until 1999. In 1996 the band decided to take a break and PF was put on hold and the band members worked on various solo projects. In 2000 the band re-united for a gig at the Tinitus Electronic Festival and announced that they were making a comeback and returning to their roots. They released a four track mini CD entitled \"Elite Electronics\". A year later though, both Jouni and Henrik left the band to concentrate on their respective solo careers. PF disbanded shortly afterwards. After seven years of absence from the scene the band re-united in 2009, Christian R filling the place of former member Jouni Ollila.

When they announced their breakup in 1999, because of musical and personal differences, they consisted of the following members: \n* Marcus Wiebusch (Vocals and Guitar); also in Rantanplan, now in Kettcar \n* Frank Tirado-Rosales (drums); also now in Kettcar \n* Hagen van der Viren (Guitar) \n* Torben Mei\u00DFner (Bass); also in Rantanplan, as well Their 1997 album Bis Jetzt Ging Alles Gut was released in North America by the Canadian G7 Welcoming Committee Records. After ...But Alive's demise, Marcus and Frank started a new band called Kettcar, taking a more mainstream pop music (particularly Coldplay and Snow Patrol influenced) approach. Since nobody wanted to release their debut album Marcus teamed up with some of his friend to launch the Grand Hotel Van Cleef label, which thus far has been quite a success."@en ;

At various times the band consisted of Leslie Jonkers, Peter Keen, Graeme Humphreys, Craig Mason, David Beniston, Jane Dodd (previously of The Verlaines), and Ronald Young. They formed in 1984 and named themselves after the Dutch explorer Abel Tasman. They released four albums and two EPs on Flying Nun Records. The band split up in 1996. Ten years later Graeme Humphreys and Peter Keen regrouped to record an album, The Overflow, under the name of Humphreys & Keen. The band's style of music could be considered as similar to the prevalent Dunedin Sound favoured by Flying Nun during the 1980s and 1990s and most effective when keyboards (not normally prominent in the Dunedin Sound) were to the fore, as on their early student radio hit \"Snow White Chook.\" Graeme Humphreys is now better known in New Zealand for his role as a radio talkback host (under the name Graeme Hill)."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"The Bus Station Loonies are a 'cabaret punk' band from Plymouth, England. They have been described as a cross between Splodgenessabounds and Crass  The band formed in 1995 in an attempt to put fun into the anarcho-punk movement. Original Loonies Tony Popkids (drums) and Chris \"Felcher\" Wheelchair (real name Chris Willsher b.1971 in Ilford, London) (vocals, keyboards, kazoo; ex-drummer with Oi Polloi, Disorder (band), Riot/Clone and DIRT, among others), sharing a mutual love of such U.S. punk outfits such as The Dickies, still continue with the band today, having recruited approximately 30 other band members over 18 years. During their initial UK tour of April 1996, with contemporary punk bands PMT and The Filth, The Loonies were billed as \"a vicious headbutt between Johnny Moped and Jello Biafra\". The band was featured in the UK's Channel 4 documentary, Punx Picnic. The Bus Station Loonies were the first band to set the official world record for the most concerts/gigs performed in 12 hours (25 different shows) on 29 Sept 2001 in and around Plymouth, Devon, UK raising money to buy musical equipment for pupils of the Dame Hannah Rogers (special needs) school in Ivybridge, Devon. The band featured in the Guinness Book of World Records, until 2006, when the record was beaten. Music journalist Mick Mercer's 1997 book The Hex Files: The Goth Bible, references The Bus Station Loonies for their 18-minute reggae rendition of The Sisters of Mercy composition, \"Temple of Love\". In October 2008, said version (from their debut album) was nominated on a live broadcast on BBC Radio 6 as 'one of the best cover versions of all-time' (The Music Week with Julie Cullen and Matt Everitt). In Autumn 2010, The Bus Station Loonies completed recording their second full-length album. Entitled Midget Gems and released on their own Ruptured Ambitions record label it features eighth guitarist Angus Old (real name Phil Cawse) and the recently recruited ninth guitarist Chris \"The Machine\" Mildren. The band's frontman, Chris Wheelie, is currently involved in a solo project Harakiri Karaoke, as well as drumming with several friends' bands on a stand-in basis (including Eastfield, Anarcho Folko, HIV and The Positives, and his old band, originally formed in 1989, C.D.S.)."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"The Foggy Mountain Boys was an American bluegrass band. The band was founded by guitarist Lester Flatt and banjo player Earl Scruggs and is viewed by music historians as one of the premier bluegrass groups in the history of the genre. The band was originally formed in 1948 by Flatt, who had been a member of Bill Monroe's bluegrass band. Flatt brought Scruggs with him shortly after leaving Monroe. Flatt and Scruggs and The Foggy Mountain Boys (in various forms and line-ups) recorded and performed together until 1969. The Foggy Mountain Boys are seen as one of the landmark bands in bluegrass music. Although it featured various casts, during the years of The Lester Flatt and Earl Scruggs Grand Ole Opry Show, notably sponsored by grain and flour producer Martha White, the band showcased fiddle player Paul Warren, a master player in both the Old-Time and Bluegrass fiddling styles, whose technique reflected all qualitative aspects of 'the bluegrass breakdown' and fast bowing style; dobro player Uncle Josh Graves, an innovator of the advanced playing style of the instrument now used in the genre, stand-up bass player Cousin Jake Tullock, and mandolinist Curly Seckler. Scruggs is widely considered the most influential player of the bluegrass banjo who ever lived. Playing since the age of four, Scruggs gained his initial spotlight when he played briefly with Bill Monroe, considered by many as the father of bluegrass music. His lightning-fast syncopation and virtuosity wove themselves into an innovative three finger picking style that became the standard for mastering the instrument."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"During the tour supporting their second studio effort, Di'Anno was fired from the band after drug and alcohol abuse affected his live performance. Vocalist Bruce Dickinson left his previous band, Samson, to audition for Iron Maiden in September 1981 and joined shortly afterwards. After the release of their third album, The Number of the Beast, drummer Nicko McBrain replaced Burr, who left due to personal and scheduling problems on the subsequent Beast on the Road tour. This is considered by many as their quintessential lineup, with which they released a series of high-impact works. In 1990, prior to the recording of their eighth studio album, Smith was asked to leave the band due to a lack of enthusiasm, brought about by the \"stripped-down\" musical direction they were taking, which Smith considered \"a step backwards\". Janick Gers, an old friend of Dickinson's who performed on his debut solo album, became the new guitarist. This formation recorded one more album before Dickinson departed in 1993, in order to pursue his solo career further. The band listened to hundreds of tapes submitted by vocalists before asking Blaze Bayley to audition, with whom they would go on to release two studio albums, after which Bayley left the band by mutual consent in January 1999. At that point, the band were in talks with Dickinson, who, after a meeting with Steve Harris and Rod Smallwood (the group's manager) in Brighton, agreed to rejoin along with Adrian Smith, who was telephoned a few hours later. Iron Maiden thus became a six-piece band and have gone on to make five further studio releases. The current lineup is now the longest and most stable in the band's history."@en ;

The group is also associated with other major French hip hop artists such as Doc Gyneco and Hamed Daye. The group's name means 'ministry of action, music and rap'. Also 'amer' means 'bitter'. Their first single, Tra\u00EEtres, was released in 1991, and it was followed by the album Pourquoi tant de haine? in 1991. The second album, 95200, came out in 1994. In 1995, after their song Sacrifice de poulet, which appeared on the soundtrack to the film La Haine, provoked the French Minister of the Interior, Charles Pasqua, to attack the group in court. The court's ruling forced the group to pay 250,000 francs of fines, but Mr Pasqua's demands for banning sales of Minist\u00E8re AMER's discs were unsuccessful. However, radio stations were reluctant to play their music after this incident, and the only station who continued to do so was Generation 88.2, an underground parisian station dedicated to hip hop music. Members of the band began to pursue solo careers after the release of their second album, and Stomy Bugsy released his first solo album Le calibre qu'il te faut in 1997. Passi also released Les tentations the same year. After the success these albums enjoyed, Kenzy created the record label Secteur \u00C4 to accommodate Minist\u00E8re AMER and other hip hop artists, such as N\u00E8g' Marrons, \u00C4rsenik, Doc Gyn\u00E9co, Hamed Daye, and Tandem. In 1997, the group's two albums were re-released as a limited edition double album. Since then, they were inactive for a long time, but regrouped in 2005 for the compilation Illicit projet."@en ;

The band has said that their main influence comes from the North Mississippi Hill country blues musicians, most of whom were or are currently signed to Fat Possum Records. Left Lane Cruiser comprises Fredrick \"Joe\" Evans IV on slide guitar and vocals with Brenn Beck on drums, harmonica, back up vocals and various percussive gear. In July 2007, Left Lane Cruiser was signed to Alive Records. Their first nationally released album, Bring Yo' Ass to the Table, was released on January 8, 2008. In September 2008, Left Lane Cruiser embarked on their first European Tour. The first few shows were cancelled due to issues with passports when arriving in the UK, forcing the two members to return to the United States for several days. Problems with passports were then resolved and Left Lane Cruiser resumed the tour. Their third album, All You Can Eat, was released on Alive Records, September 15, 2009. The song \"Waynedale\" from the All You Can Eat album was used on episode 8 of season 3 of the television series Breaking Bad. The band released its fourth album on March 1, 2011, on Alive Records, some of which was recorded with John Wesley Myers, the keyboard player for the Black Diamond Heavies, also signed to Alive Records."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Nonexist is a Swedish melodic death/thrash metal group formed by former Arch Enemy vocalist, Johan Liiva. Liiva, guitarist/bassist (on record) Johan Reinholdz (of Andromeda, Skyfire) and drummer Matte Modin (of Defleshed, Dark Funeral). They began playing together as Nonexist in 2000; in May 2002, they released their debut album, Deus Deceptor, on New Hawen Records in Europe and Century Media in North America. The group attempted to put together a touring lineup in 2002, but this never occurred, in part due to the group members' commitment to other projects. In 2003 Liiva and Modin split from the group, leaving Reinholdz the primary (and only) member. In 2004 Liiva (now with Hearse) confirmed the group's demise. In 2011 Nonexist was resurrected as Reinholdz started writing the second album \"From My Cold Dead Hands\". It was then recorded in 2011/2012 with Johan Liiva back on vocals, and released by Pivotal Rockordings in November 2012 and by Japanese label Trooper Entertainment in May 2013. This album was the debut as a producer for Reinholdz, doing all the mixing, producing and mastering himself. The band made their live-debut at the Scorched Tundra Festival in Gothenburg, December 2012. In 2014 Nonexist started recording album number three entitled Throne of Scars. It features nine tracks and is produced and mixed by Johan Reinholdz at Multipass Studios with the assistance of Markus Nilsson at Sunnan\u00E5 Studio in Malm\u00F6. The style of the songs retain the atmosphere from the previous album; dark, intense, varied and heavy while also adding some new influences in the mix. \"Throne of Scars\" was mixed and ready in April 2015 and during the same time the band signed a deal with Danish label Mighty Music. The album was released in Japan by Trooper Entertainment, in August and in the rest of the world by Mighty Music on October 10, 2015. In November 2015 Johan Liiva quit the band and Reinholdz took over the frontman-duties doing both guitar and vocals in the studio and also live - where the band now is active with Faithful Darkness-members Johan Aldg\u00E5rd and Joakim Strandberg Nilsson as well as Andromeda-bassplayer Linus Abrhamson completing the line-up. Nonexist is currently working on an EP called \"The New Flesh\" which will feature songs from \"Throne of Scars\" as well as tracks from previous albums with Reinholdz' vocals."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Bazooka was a musical band active in the early 1990s, and led by drummer Vince Meghrouni. Their music could be broadly classified as jazz, but also touched on other styles. All their albums were released by SST Records. The first line-up was Meghrouni, bass guitarist Bill Crawford and saxophonist Tony Atherton. This lineup of Bazooka record three albums: \"Perfectly Square\", \"Blowhole\", and \"Cigars, Oyster and Booze.\" Songwriting was split about evenly between the trio's members, with a healthy dose of jazz standards written by the likes of Thelonious Monk, Sonny Rollins and Lee Morgan. The music was generally in a bebop or hard bop vein, though a few pieces were freely improvised, and there was a strong punk rock or hard rock quality, particularly in Crawford's playing. In his review of 1994's Blowhole, Richard Foss wrote, \"It is difficult to articulate just what makes Bazooka such an interesting band and Blowhole such a fine album. There are other bands that play jazz with rock fervor and wild abandon, but few who do so with anything approaching this level of pure musicianship.\" However, in December 1994, Atherton decided to leave the band, followed shortly thereafter by Crawford. Meghrouni used the Bazooka name with a new quartet, consisting of Meghrouni retaining his position as a drummer, pianist Don Carroll, guitarist Jeremy Keller and bass guitarist Steve Reed. Keller was the primary composer, and the new line-up had a very different sound, more in line with funk and jazz fusion. Sonic Business Environment -- apparently Bazook's final record\u2014earned positive reviews, and even appeared on a few jazz radio charts."@en ;

The band was founded after the demise of Cave and Harvey's former group the Birthday Party, the members of which met at a boarding school in Victoria, Australia. Deviating from the noise rock roots of their contemporaries, Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds have produced alternative rock that has been influenced by various genres, such as punk rock, gothic rock, no wave and blues. Their early material\u2014From Her to Eternity (1984), The Firstborn Is Dead (1985), Your Funeral... My Trial (1986) and Tender Prey (1988)\u2014primarily featured a post-punk sound. The band has progressively incorporated other songwriting elements; for example, the 2008 release Dig, Lazarus, Dig!!! experimented with garage rock, also an influence of the side project Grinderman.

	dbo:abstract	"Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five were an American hip hop group formed in the South Bronx of New York City in 1976. Composed of one DJ (Grandmaster Flash) and five rappers (Melle Mel, The Kidd Creole, Keith Cowboy, Mr. Ness/Scorpio, and Rahiem), the group's use of turntablism, break-beat deejaying, and conscious lyricism were a significant force in the early development of hip hop music. Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five initially built their reputation performing at parties and live shows in the mid-1970s and achieved local success. By the time the Sugarhill Gang's \"Rapper's Delight\" was released, the group realized the potential of cutting records and signed with various labels until staying with Sugar Hill Records. Under Sugar Hill Records, the group rose to prominence in the early 1980s with their first hit \"Freedom\" (1980), but it wasn't until the release of \"The Message\" (1982) and the album of the same name that they achieved mainstream success. Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five would eventually break up into two separate groups due to differences until a brief reunion in 1987 led to the release of the original line-up's second album On the Strength. Afterward, they disbanded permanently. Today the group's legacy continues on as Grandmaster\u2019s Furious Five with only Melle Mel and Scorpio as remaining members. The group is widely regarded as among the most influential hip hop acts. Their biggest single and acknowledged masterpiece \"The Message\" (1982) is often cited as one of the greatest hip hop songs of all time. In 2007, Jay-Z inducted them into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame, making them the first hip hop group ever to be inducted."@en ;

Their 1967 single \"Desdemona\", a Bolan composition, was banned by the BBC because of the controversial lyric, \"Lift up your skirt and fly.\" Their US record label delayed the release their album, Orgasm for four years from its recording date due to objections from Daughters of the American Revolution. John's Children were active for less than two years and were not very successful commercially, having released only six singles and one album. But they had a big influence on punk rock and are seen by some as the precursors of glam rock. In retrospect the band has been praised for the impact they had, and their singles have become amongst the most sought-after British 1960s rock collectables."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Lifter Puller, or LFTR PLLR, was an American indie rock band from the Twin Cities and the Boston area between 1994 and 2000. Their music is considered innovative, with its angular riffs and a synth-infused sound that predated the 80's revival fads of the early 2000s. Arguably, however, the band is most known for frontman Craig Finn's elaborate lyrics, which often relied upon an established universe of drug-addled coeds, cash-strapped nightclub proprietors, murdered ravers and other nostalgic excursions in Minneapolis and Boston. The band released three LPs and an EP before breaking up in the summer of 2000. In 2002, the compilation Soft Rock was released, featuring nearly every song in the Lifter Puller catalogue, excluding their final album, Fiestas and Fiascos, and the songs \"Prescription Sunglasses\", \"Emperor\", \"Slips Backwards,\" and \"Bitchy Christmas,\" as well as the original version of \"Nassau Colisseum,\" the b-side to the \"Slips Backwards\" single. After several years out of print, all of the original Lifter Puller records were re-issued digitally with bonus tracks in December 2009. These reissues were accompanied by a limited-edition book entitled Lifter Puller vs. The End of. Singer/guitarist Craig Finn and bassist Tad Kubler are now members of The Hold Steady, which continues to explore some of the lyrical themes established by Lifter Puller while eschewing the art punk sound of the prior band in favor of a sound more akin to classic-rock revivalism. In 2003, the band reunited for three sold out shows for the opening of the Triple Rock Social Club in their hometown of Minneapolis. They have a star on the Minneapolis nightclub First Avenue on the 7th street side. The band reunited on July 4, 2015 in Minneapolis, Minnesota at the Triple Rock Social Club at Dillinger Four's annual \"D4th of July\" event for an eight-song set. On September 2, 2016 they reunited yet again to support Atmosphere at Red Rocks Amphitheater in Morrison Colorado. ."@en ;

Some claim that they were best in the world . They were India's first rock band. It is difficult to classify them into a musical genre, as their music drew from wide variety of influences, including the Baul and folk traditions of Bengali music and rock. Their style of music can be loosely called folk rock. Established in the 1970s during a period of stagnation in Bengali music, when commercial film songs were the dominant market force, the lyrics (and to some extent the compositions) of leader Gautam Chattopadhyay were radically new. They were of a very personal or social nature, similar to the urban folk movement led by Bob Dylan in the 60s. Though they were almost unknown in their time, in recent years they have undergone a critical re-evaluation much like the Velvet Underground. In recognition of this renewed interest, Gautam released a compilation of Mohiner Ghoraguli covers by contemporary artists, Aabaar Bochhor Kuri Pore in 1995. They have since come to be considered an unrecognised pioneers of the jibonmukhi style and ethics, decades ahead of their times. They are sometimes also credited as the pioneers of the flourishing of Bengali bands in the new millennium. This is debatable as their songwriting was strongly rooted in Bengali folk and also American urban folk, while modern Bengali bands like Fossils and Insomnia are influenced by grunge. Their signature song is Prithibita Naki (\u09AA\u09C3\u09A5\u09BF\u09AC\u09C0\u099F\u09BE \u09A8\u09BE\u0995\u09BF), a reflection on how television creates urban alienation.

	dbo:abstract	"Aria (Russian: \u0410\u0440\u0438\u044F) is a Russian heavy metal band that was formed in 1985 in Moscow. Although it was not the first Soviet band to play heavy music, Aria was the first to break through to mainstream media and commercial success. According to several public polls, Aria ranks among top 10 most popular Russian rock bands. Their sound resembled that of NWOBHM bands, for which they were dubbed the \"Russian Iron Maiden\" in the media. Most of Aria's lyrics have been written not by the band's members but by professional poets Margarita Pushkina and Alexander Yelin. Aria is the root of so-called \"Aria Family\": several bands formed by its former members. In 1987, four ex-members of Aria formed the band Master, who are still considered, along with Aria, one of the most influential Russian metal bands. Vocalist Valery Kipelov, who was the main voice of the band for the majority of albums they have released, departed in 2002 and formed his own heavy-metal band Kipelov. Till Lindemann & Richard Kruspe of Rammstein have covered an Aria song, \"Shtil\" (\u0428\u0442\u0438\u043B\u044C). In this cover version, the song's name is Germanized and spelled as \"Schtiel\"."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"The Carter Family was a traditional American folk music group that recorded between 1927 and 1956. Their music had a profound impact on bluegrass, country, Southern Gospel, pop and rock musicians as well as on the U.S. folk revival of the 1960s. They were the first vocal group to become country music stars. Their recordings of songs such as \"Wabash Cannonball\", \"Can the Circle Be Unbroken\", \"Wildwood Flower\", \"Keep On the Sunny Side\" and \"I'm Thinking Tonight of My Blue Eyes\" made these songs country standards. The latter's tune was used for Roy Acuff's \"The Great Speckled Bird\", Hank Thompson's \"The Wild Side of Life\" and Kitty Wells' \"It Wasn't God Who Made Honky Tonk Angels\", making the song a hit all over again in other incarnations. The original group consisted of Alvin Pleasant \"A.P.\" Delaney Carter (1891\u20131960), his wife Sara Dougherty Carter (1898\u20131979), and his sister-in-law Maybelle Addington Carter (1909\u20131978). Maybelle was married to A.P.'s brother Ezra (Eck) Carter, and was also Sara's first cousin. All three were born and raised in southwestern Virginia, where they were immersed in the tight harmonies of mountain gospel music and shape note singing. Throughout the group's career, Sara Carter sang lead vocals; Maybelle sang harmony and accompanied the group instrumentally; on some songs A.P. did not perform at all but at times sang harmony and background vocals and, once in a while, lead vocal. Maybelle's distinctive guitar playing style became a hallmark of the group."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Death Cab for Cutie is an American alternative rock band, formed in Bellingham, Washington in 1997. The band comprises Ben Gibbard (vocals, guitar, piano), Nick Harmer (bass), Dave Depper (guitar, keyboards, vocals), Zac Rae (keyboards, guitar), and Jason McGerr (drums). In 2014, founding guitarist and producer Chris Walla announced that he would be departing from the band after recording their eighth studio album, Kintsugi. The band was originally a solo project by Ben Gibbard, when he released the demo album You Can Play These Songs with Chords to positive reception. This led to a record deal with Barsuk Records. Gibbard decided to expand the project into a complete band, releasing their debut album Something About Airplanes in 1998, and their second album, We Have the Facts and We're Voting Yes, in 2000; both records were positively received in the indie community. Their third album, 2001's The Photo Album, gave the band their first charting single, and the release of the group's fourth album Transatlanticism, in 2003, gained the band mainstream critical and commercial success. After signing with Atlantic Records, Death Cab For Cutie released their fifth album and major-label debut Plans in 2005, which received platinum certification from the Recording Industry Association of America. The band released their sixth album Narrow Stairs in 2008, which served as a stylistic departure for the group. Their seventh album, 2011's Codes and Keys, featured the band's first number one single, \"You Are a Tourist\". Their eighth studio album Kintsugi, the last to feature Walla, was released on March 31, 2015. Death Cab for Cutie's music has been labeled as indie rock, indie pop, and alternative rock. It is noted for its use of unconventional instrumentation, as well as Gibbard's distinctive voice and unique lyrical style. Since their formation, the band has released eight full-length studio albums, four EPs, two live EPs, one live album, and one demo album."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"The Dixie Chicks are an American country music band which has also crossed over into other genres, including pop and alternative country. The band is composed of founding members (and sisters) Martie Erwin Maguire and Emily Erwin Robison, and lead singer Natalie Maines. The band formed in 1989 in Dallas, Texas, and was originally composed of four women performing bluegrass and country music, busking and touring the bluegrass festival circuits and small venues for six years without attracting a major label. After the departure of one bandmate, the replacement of their lead singer, and a slight change in their repertoire, Dixie Chicks soon achieved commercial success, beginning in 1998 with hit songs \"There's Your Trouble\" and \"Wide Open Spaces\". On March 10, 2003, during a London concert, nine days before the March 19, 2003 invasion of Iraq, lead vocalist Maines told the audience: \"We don't want this war, this violence, and we're ashamed that the President of the United States (George W. Bush) is from Texas\". The positive reaction to this statement from the British audience contrasted with the negative reaction including boycotts that ensued in the US, where the band was denounced by talk-show conservatives, while their albums were discarded in public protest. As of 2015, Dixie Chicks have won 13 Grammy Awards, including five in 2007 for Taking the Long Way\u2014which received the Grammy Award for Album of the Year\u2014and \"Not Ready to Make Nice\", a single from that album. By December 2015, with 30.5 million certified albums sold, and sales of 27.5 million albums in the U.S. alone, they had become the top selling all-female band and biggest-selling country group in the U.S. during the Nielsen SoundScan era (1991\u2013present)."@en ;

The group consisted of vocalist and bassist Mark Hoppus and drummer Travis Barker of Blink-182, lead guitarist Shane Gallagher of The Nervous Return and rhythm guitarist Craig Fairbaugh of Mercy Killers. Hoppus and Barker created +44 shortly after the 2005 breakup of Blink-182, and the band's name refers to the international dialing code of the United Kingdom, the country where the duo first discussed the project. Early recordings were largely electronic in nature, and featured vocals by Carol Heller, formerly of the all-girl punk quartet Get the Girl. The band's sound gradually took on a heavier tone as Hoppus and Barker purchased a studio in which to record. Although hotly anticipated by music press, the band's debut, When Your Heart Stops Beating (2006), undersold commercial expectations and received mixed reviews from critics. The group toured worldwide throughout 2006 and 2007, including a summer slot on the Honda Civic Tour alongside Fall Out Boy. Hoppus later began preparing material for a solo album and put plans for a second +44 album on hold in 2008, and the group entered an extended hiatus with the reunion of Blink-182 in 2009. On the subject of the band's future, Hoppus has commented, \"I don't consider it done. We'll never say never with anything.\""@en ;

In November 2005, 19 Wheels broke up\u2014not because of differences in music or personality, but rather because \"They wanted to put a period on it and have a sense of accomplishment at the end.\" (Rob Dickey) 19 Wheels' claim to fame came when their track, \"Reactor\" was featured on Ford's website for the new 2010 Ford Fusion."@en ;

The group consists of Adrian S\u00EEn\u0103, the creator of the group. In late 1998, he was joined by Romanian pop singer Ramona Barta to create the duo called Akcent. The two released their debut single \u2014 \"Ultima vara\" (The last summer) along with the debut album, entitled Senzatia - The Sensation. After a spare of time, the duo disbanded and Sina brought Marius Nedelcu, Mihai Gruia and Sorin Brotnei to the group, changing it from a mixed duo to a boyband. They came to prominence once with the release of their hit single \"Ti-am promis\" (I promised you). The climax of the group's career was the international release of their breakthrough single \"Kylie\", the English version of their internal hit \"Dragoste de inchiriat\". The song reached the peak position in many European charts and fared well enough in countries such as the Netherlands and France. They even participated in the Selec\u021Bia Na\u021Bional\u0103, with hopes of representing Romania in the Eurovision Song Contest. They united with pop singer Nicoleta Matei and entered the song \"Jockero\" which failed to win. Nevertheless, it became yet another number-one single on the Romanian Top 100 for the band. All through late 2000s and early 2010s, their success was continued."@en ;

After touring in support of the album, the band went into hiatus in mid-2007, with members returning to their respective bands, except Luzier, who joined Korn. Despite being relatively inactive since 2007, all members have stayed in contact, and have independently shown interest in working on a second album if the logistics and scheduling of their commitments to other bands ever aligned."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Bloodbound is a Swedish power metal band formed in 2004. They released their first album, Nosferatu, in 2005 and their second, Book of the Dead, in May 2007. The brainchild of former Street Talk members Fredrik Bergh and Tomas Olsson, the band has also included Michael Bormann (Jaded Heart), Urban breed (Tad Morose) and Pelle \u00C5kerlind (Morgana Lefay). Their debut album Nosferatu featured former Tad Morose singer Urban breed on vocals. Released on 16 December 2005 (in Japan; European release date 24 February 2006), Nosferatu features artwork by Mark Wilkinson (Iron Maiden, Judas Priest, Marillion) and received an early rave review from the Swedish rock magazine Power Play. Based solely on the strength of their debut album, the band opened for Evergrey and headlined day one of the Gothenburg Metal Festival. After Urban breed announced his departure from Bloodbound in fall 2006, former Tad Morose singer Kristian Andr\u00E8n briefly joined the band for some live dates. In March 2007, they announced their new singer, German Michael Bormann, who laid down vocals on the band's second album Book of the Dead. Bormann, however, played no live shows with Bloodbound: for their first performance after releasing Book of the Dead (9 June 2007 at Sweden Rock Festival), Urban breed handled the vocal duties. Urban also performed with the band at subsequent shows, including Bolln\u00E4s Festivalen, 21 July 2007. Bloodbound played two sets, both backed up by a symphony orchestra. For the second set they backed Paul Di'Anno of Iron Maiden fame. In October 2007, they announced that original singer Urban breed had officially re-joined and would sing during the band's tour in support of HammerFall. On 13 April 2010, breed announced on his forum that Bloodbound had decided to continue with another singer, ending his second tenure with the band. Despite the band's apparent black metal image (the band members have worn make-up in the \"corpse paint\" style in the promotional photos on their albums and Web site, and during some live shows), Bloodbound's music does not fit into the black metal category. Instead, it is more similar in style to power metal bands such as Helloween and Iron Maiden, although the lyrics sometimes approach darker subjects. In 2009 the band signed a worldwide deal with the label Blistering Records for their third album release, titled Tabula Rasa. The album was set for release on 26 April 2009."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Blossom Toes were an English psychedelic pop band active between 1967 and 1969. Initially known as The Ingoes, they were renamed and signed to manager Giorgio Gomelsky's Marmalade label. The original line-up comprised Brian Godding (born 19 August 1945, Monmouth, South Wales) (guitar, vocals, keyboards), Jim Cregan (born James Cregan, 9 March 1946, Yeovil, Somerset) (guitar, vocals), Brian Belshaw (born 25 February 1944, Wigan, Lancashire) (bass, vocals), and Kevin Westlake (born Kevin Patrick Westlake, 5 March 1947, Dublin, Co Dublin, Ireland \u2014 30 September 2004) (drums). The band's debut album, We Are Ever So Clean is a classic example of quintessentially English psychedelia. On release, it was presented in the UK music magazine Melody Maker as \"Giorgio Gomelsky's Lonely Hearts Club Band\". Although not a major commercial success, tracks such as \"What On Earth\" or \"Look At Me, I'm You\" have helped give the album something of a cult period status as it is unearthed by successive generations of 1960s retro fans. It was included in Record Collector's list of the \"100 Greatest Psychedelic Records\". If Only For A Moment saw the band taking a noticeably heavier and rockier direction, with Cregan and Godding's distinctive two-part guitar harmonies playing a prominent role. At this point Westlake left, and was replaced by  John \"Poli\" Palmer, and then Barry Reeves. The band quit in 1970. Belshaw and Godding rejoined Westlake in B.B. Blunder, Cregan formed Stud with John Wilson and Charlie McCracken, before joining Family, as did Palmer. The Blossom Toes contributed music to La Collectionneuse (1967), a film by French director \u00C9ric Rohmer and also appeared in \"Popdown\" (1967) by Fred Marshall."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Boom Crash Opera are an Australian pop rock band formed in early 1985. Initially they were based around the songwriting partnership of Richard Pleasance on guitar, bass guitar and vocals; and Peter Farnan on guitar, bass guitar, keyboards, and vocals. Pleasance developed tinnitus from constant exposure to loud live music & left in 1992 to pursue a solo career as an artist & producer. In March 2015 Dale Ryder informed the band he was leaving. His last gig with them was November 2015. On March 6, 2016 the band informed their fans of Ryder's decision to leave the group by placing a link to a Noise 11 article on their Facebook page. The article also announced that Ryder would be replaced by ex-CDB and Australia's Got Talent winner Andrew De Silva. The group also includes Peter 'Maz' Maslen on drums, percussion and vocals; Greg O'Connor on keyboards and guitar; and from 1992 Ian Tilley on bass guitar and vocals. Their top 20 albums are Boom Crash Opera (September 1987), These Here Are Crazy Times (October 1989), and Fabulous Beast (March 1993). Their top 20 singles are \"Great Wall\", \"Hands up in the Air\" (both 1986), \"Onion Skin\" (1989) and \"Gimme\" (1994). In the United States \"Onion Skin\" reached No. 8 on the Billboard component chart, Modern Rock Tracks. Australian musicologist, Ian McFarlane, noted that the group had a \"strong visual image and the uncanny ability of its principal songwriters to pen catchy, commercial songs ensured a string of successful releases\"."@en ;

After playing out for about a year he met Andrew Bernhardt (guitar, keys) through a classified ad. The two played out with a rhythm section for a year and a half, while refining their tunes and building a following. When their drummer pursued another gig, Dustin Paul (drums) was brought on to solidify the set. After playing several shows with the band, his heavy-handed, simplistic style turned out to be a good fit. That opened up the door for Mark Wiskowski (bass guitar) to come and fill out the bottom end. Mark's audition was head and shoulders above the rest, and he was added. From May 2004 - current day, the four members moved at a steady pace. They've played major venues along the west coast, made a few videos, recorded two full-length albums and written a wide variety of rock songs. Cape May had a clear goal of making quality music with hints of classic rock flavor and mixes it with tastes of indie rock to create their own unified sound. For more information about this electrifying foursome visit the Official Cape May Website. As of January 2007 they have broken up."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Carabao (Thai: \u0E04\u0E32\u0E23\u0E32\u0E1A\u0E32\u0E27) is a Thai rock band that is very popular in Thailand and other Asian countries. The group was formed in 1981 by university students Yuenyong Opakul (Aed) and Kirati Promsaka Na Sakon Nakhon (Keo or Khiao) who met while studying at Map\u00FAa Institute of Technology in the Philippines. The word carabao means \"buffalo\", a symbol of fighting, hard work, and patience. They are known for their Phleng phuea chiwit (\u0E40\u0E1E\u0E25\u0E07\u0E40\u0E1E\u0E37\u0E48\u0E2D\u0E0A\u0E35\u0E27\u0E34\u0E15) or 'songs for life'. This kind of music came to prominence through the protest songs of the 1970s political upheaval in Thailand, especially from the band Caravan. Carabao have blended the acoustic/folk style of 'peua chiwit' with other forms of Thai music, western rock and country music, and various kinds of world music like Latin music and reggae, earning such labels as 'ethnic rockers' and 'Kings of 3Cha' or 'Rolling Stones of Asia'. MTV Asia calls them \"veteran\". Carabao's songs often tackle social and political issues, demanding social justice and taking on the causes of the ordinary Thai people, but they have also created love songs and more philosophical songs that carry messages for people everywhere. Lead singer/songwriter Aed Carabao is loved by many and is also famous for his sharp tongue and open criticism of corrupt politicians, big business, and environmental destruction. At least one or two songs on most albums up to the mid-'90s were banned by the government and coverage of the band rarely appeared on government TV and radio stations. Despite this, Carabao is the most popular Thai rock group of all time. Carabao reached cult status long ago and is now one of the most successful legendary rock groups in the world. They have been compared to the rock band U2."@en ;

The group has undertaken a number of world tours. Cumulatively, albums by Celtic Woman have sold over nine million records worldwide. The foundation for Celtic music's popularity outside Ireland and Europe was built by tapping into the success of artists such as Enya, Moya Brennan and Clannad, along with stage shows Riverdance and Lord of the Dance.

	dbo:abstract	"Creation Is Crucifixion is a mathcore band that was formed in early 1997 in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The band was known for its complicated sound, which varied from ambient noise to more complex pieces. Their lyrical themes often dealt with technology and various functions of society, such as politics and religion. The members of the band formed Hactivist Media in 2001 to release the recordings and experiments of the group. This signaled a step in the band's evolution as the group became increasingly political with the release of their Child as Audience CD in 2001, which featured a large booklet printed in multiple languages that theorized using technology as subversion (focusing on the reprogramming of children's video games). The band also experimented with various formats by releasing compositions on 3.5\" discs through the organization. Creation Is Crucifixion has been mostly inactive since 2002. There is a further release in the works via Robotic Empire, but the release has suffered numerous delays. Former member, Scott Mellinger is a member of hardcore Christian band Zao. Michael Laughlin was formerly the drummer of the deathgrind band Cattle Decapitation."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Panic! at the Disco is an American rock band from Las Vegas, Nevada, formed in 2004 and featuring the current lineup of vocalist Brendon Urie, accompanied on tour by bassist Dallon Weekes, guitarist Kenneth Harris and drummer Dan Pawlovich. Founded by childhood friends Ryan Ross, Spencer Smith, Brent Wilson and Brendon Urie, Panic! at the Disco recorded its first demos while its members were in high school. Shortly after, the band recorded and released its debut studio album, A Fever You Can't Sweat Out (2005). Popularized by the lead single, \"I Write Sins Not Tragedies\", the album was certified double platinum in the US. In 2006, founding bassist Brent Wilson was fired from the band during an extensive world tour, and subsequently replaced by Jon Walker. Influenced by 1960s rock bands the Beatles, the Zombies and the Beach Boys, and preceded by the hit single, \"Nine in the Afternoon\", the band's second studio album, Pretty. Odd. (2008), marked a significant departure from the sound of the band's debut, and ultimately led to the departure of guitarist and principal songwriter Ryan Ross and bassist Jon Walker, who favored the band's new direction. The duo subsequently formed a new band, the Young Veins, leaving Brendon Urie and Spencer Smith as the sole remaining members of Panic! at the Disco. Continuing as a duo, Urie and Smith released a new single, \"New Perspective\", and recruited Dallon Weekes as the group's bassist and Ian Crawford as the band's lead guitarist to accompany the band during live performances. Weekes was later inducted into the band's lineup as a full-time member in 2010, nearing the end of the recording of the band's third studio album, Vices & Virtues (2011). The album was recorded solely by Urie and Smith, with producers John Feldmann and Butch Walker. As a three-piece, Urie, Smith, and Weekes recorded and released the band's fourth studio album, Too Weird to Live, Too Rare to Die!, in 2013. Prior to the release of the album, Smith unofficially left the band due to health and drug-related issues, leaving Urie and Weekes as the remaining members. In 2015, Smith officially left the band after not performing live with the band since his departure in 2013. Shortly thereafter, Weekes reverted to being a touring member once again, leaving Brendon Urie as the only member of the official lineup. In April 2015, \"Hallelujah\" was released as the first single from Panic! at the Disco's fifth studio album, Death of a Bachelor (2016)."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"The Go-Bang's were a three-piece Japanese girl band active in the late 1980s and early 1990s. They broke up in 1994, and since then, Kaori Moriwaka (singer/songwriter) has become a solo singer/songwriter/producer/actress, while Mitsuko Saito (drums) and Misa Tanishima (bass guitar) have dropped beneath the radar, though apparently Saito has been seen drumming for a few other bands, fashion-modeling and played a drummer as an extra in the music video of J-pop singer Namie Amuro's Please Smile Again. Initially a four-piece band, Go-Bang's lost their guitarist early on, becoming popular after she left the band. At the peak of their career, the album \"Greatest Venus\" went straight to the top of Oricon's Japanese album chart and stayed there for two consecutive weeks. They had a somewhat unusual sound, being a punk-influenced bubblegum pop band, and lacking a lead guitarist \u2014 though this wasn't always the case \u2014 on the album Samantha, for example, the Go-Bang's worked with the King Gang's, a three-piece all-male band, who complemented their line up with the addition of electric guitars and keyboard. The album Samantha was mixed down by Michael Haas, who was a recording engineer for British techno/house band 808 State, at Revolution Studio in Manchester, England. Also, the album's title song \"Samansa\" was reproduced as an English language song and remixed by John Waddel from Rhythm King Productions, who produced British pop singer/rap artist Betty Boo. This remix version of the song was released as one of the songs on their remix mini album \"Darrin.\" Making cheerful, bouncy music, with a slight punk edge, the Go-Bang's made an impact on the Japanese charts for a short while, but gradually faded into the background, and disappeared almost completely from the public conscious following their breakup. However, some bands, such as the Titan Go-Kings, have referred to them as influences on their music."@en ;

The formation of Gomatt\u014D was announced in October 2002. The idea behind the trio was an R&B style dance-based group featuring Hello! Project soloists Maki Goto, Aya Matsuura and Miki Fujimoto, and was both conceived and named by producer Tsunku. Maki Goto functioned as the leader of the group. Gomatt\u014D made their first television appearance in November, and later released their first (and only) single called \"Shall We Love?\" on November 20, 2002. On December 11, 2002, Goto and Fujimoto performed with Yuko Nakazawa, a fellow member of Hello! Project, as a one-off performance. This incarnation of the group was called \"Gonatt\u014D\" (replacing the \"ma\" of \"Matsuura\" with the \"na\" of \"Nakazawa\"). All three members later recorded solo versions of the song, all with different arrangements. Miki Fujimoto's version was a more down-tempo soul inspired version, and both Maki Goto and Aya Matsuura's versions were\u2014like the original version\u2014inspired by the productions of Kevin \"She'kspere\" Briggs. The single was also featured on the 2008 compilation album \"Hello! Project Special Units Mega Best\". Goto and Matsuura would later work together with Natsumi Abe in the one-off unit Nochiura Natsumi, which later morphed into Def.Diva with the addition of v-u-den's Rika Ishikawa. Fujimoto joined Morning Musume (Goto's former group) and also became a supplementary member of Country Musume. In June 2006, it was announced that Fujimoto and Matsuura would form a new duo, GAM, and their first single was released in September of the same year (though they released only 3 singles before becoming inactive after March 2007). All three members graduated from Hello! Project in March 2009 with the rest of the Elder Club."@en ;

Due to their heavy use of German lyrics, Germanic imagery, and German-sounding pseudonyms, they are often mistaken for being a German band, and are largely regarded as the only existing American Neue Deutsche H\u00E4rte band of note.

	dbo:abstract	"INVSN (formerly Invasionen and before that The Lost Patrol Band) is the music project of Swedish Punk rock musician Dennis Lyxz\u00E9n. In contrast to his other projects, Refused and The (International) Noise Conspiracy, this started out as a solo career and much more folkish and softer than his prior music endeavors. The band was previously called the Lost Patrol Band; however, the name was changed because the American group, The Lost Patrol holds the North American trademark on the name. As the name changed, the band started to write music in Swedish. In 1999, Lyxz\u00E9n put together a release titled \"Songs in the Key of Resistance\" which was written in the political vein that Lyxz\u00E9n's fans best know him for. The album received mixed reactions. Critics often blasted the album for straying from its creator's punk roots, while others were impressed by Lyxz\u00E9n's ability to diversify his musical output. The Lost Patrol returned in 2003 with \"Songs about Running Away\". According to Lyxz\u00E9n, the album had been supposed to be just as subversive and political as his previous album, yet due to relationship problems, it ended up being an emotional outburst. Guests such as David Sandstr\u00F6m (Refused), Stefan Granberg (Randy) and Lisa Miskovsky helped to make this album one of Lyxz\u00E9n's most experimental. In 2005, Burning Heart Records reported that The Lost Patrol has grown from Lyxz\u00E9n's solo project into a full-fledged band. This is reflected in the title of the 2005 album The Lost Patrol Band. The album also represents a further change in style, this time encompassing the upbeat sounds of 1970s/'80s punk and power pop. In 2013 the group signed to Razor & Tie and changed their name to INVSN."@en ;
