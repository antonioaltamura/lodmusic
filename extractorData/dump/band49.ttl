The band is known for clever and sometimes sarcastic lyrics, as they frequently use their songs as vehicles to lampoon perceived excesses in Western culture. Their musical style combines elements of alternative rock and Britpop, anchored by melodically powerful choruses. All Star United has released five full-length albums, a collector's EP, and a \"best of\" collection that included two previously unreleased songs. Their latest full-length project (The Good Album) was released internationally in 2009, but the US release was delayed until early 2010 and includes an additional radio single \"Beautiful Way.\" The band has had several No. 1 charting songs in the United States, including the songs \"Smash Hit\" and \"Superstar\". They also had a No. 1 single in Singapore titled \"If We Were Lovers\". Band leader and founder, Eskelin has also released three solo projects and currently writes and produces for a variety of bands and artists. In 2008 Eskelin received a Dove Award for \"Producer of the Year\", and was nominated again in the same category in 2009. All Star United's songs have been licensed in recent years for use on ABC's The Evidence, the movie Saved!, the trailer for the film Superbad, and multiple CBS network imaging campaigns."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Army of the Pharaohs (most commonly abbreviated as AOTP or A.O.T.P.) is an American underground hip hop collective originating from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, formed by Jedi Mind Tricks MC Vinnie Paz in 1998. The group has strong links to other underground groups such as; OuterSpace, Snowgoons, La Coka Nostra, Demigodz and Jedi Mind Tricks. It has changed several times since its formation. Paz formed the outfit in the late 1990s with the original roster of Bahamadia, Chief Kamachi, Virtuoso, 7L & Esoteric, plus Jedi Mind Tricks' other member Stoupe the Enemy of Mankind. The group first released the \"Five Perfect Exertions\" and \"War Ensemble\" 12\" on Paz's short-lived Recordings in 1998, but then the underground supergroup remained silent for several years. After a couple of successful Jedi Mind Tricks albums and a new deal with Babygrande by 2003, Paz resurrected the crew, adding OuterSpace, Celph Titled, Reef the Lost Cauze, King Syze, Des Devious, and Apathy; however, Stoupe, Bahamadia, and Virtuoso had defected from the group. Babygrande issued their \"Tear It Down\" 12\" and first album, The Torture Papers, in 2006. The 2007 follow-up album, Ritual of Battle, saw Jus Allah and JMT prot\u00E9g\u00E9s Doap Nixon and Demoz joining the Pharaohs. The Unholy Terror was released on March 30, 2010. This album marked the return of Apathy and the addition of two new AOTP members, Block McCloud Journalist. Two songs, \"Godzilla\" and \"Contra Mantra\", were released before the album. This album also marked the departure of Chief Kamachi who left the group because of business issues and an apparent feud with Vinnie Paz & Apathy. In early 2011, Vinnie Paz announced on his Facebook page that In Death Reborn is due to be released in 2012, however the date was pushed back and almost seemed like it was never going to be released. Early in 2012, Houston underground MC Zilla and Connecticut's Blacastan were added to the group. Both artists have made names for themselves with their features and album releases in 2012. In Death Reborn was eventually released on April 22, 2014. The album featured members Vinnie Paz, Apathy, Blacastan, Block McCloud, Celph Titled, Demoz, Des Devious, Doap Nixon, Esoteric, Lawrence Arnell, King Magnetic, King Syze, OuterSpace, Reef the Lost Cauze and Zilla. Their fifth studio album, Heavy Lies the Crown was released on October 21, 2014."@en ;

Several backing musicians also performed with the trio; however, these backing musicians were not officially part of Blackhawk until 2008. Prior to the group's formation, Robbins and Stephenson had co-written several Number One singles for the country pop band Restless Heart, and Stephenson had also charted two pop hits in the early 1980s. Paul was previously a member of the Southern rock band Outlaws as well. In 1993, Blackhawk was signed to a record deal with Arista Nashville. Their debut single, \"Goodbye Says It All\", was released that year, peaking at No. 11 on the Billboard Hot Country Singles & Tracks (now Hot Country Songs) charts, and their first album (1994's BlackHawk) was certified 2\u00D7 Multi-Platinum by the RIAA. Throughout the rest of the 1990s, the band continued to chart several singles, in addition to releasing three more albums and a Greatest Hits package. Van Stephenson departed the group in 2000 due to complications from skin cancer. He was replaced with Randy Threet (also a former member of the Outlaws), who made his first appearance on Spirit Dancer, the band's fifth studio album. After Threet's departure in 2003, Anthony Crawford took over as tenor vocalist and lead guitarist; Crawford was, in turn, succeeded by Michael Randall four years later. From early 2008 until he re-joined in 2010, Robbins left the group to resume his songwriting career, and Threet re-joined. Since then, BlackHawk's backing band has been subsumed into the main group, which comprises Paul (lead vocals, guitar, mandolin), Randy Threet (bass guitar, background vocals), Chris Anderson (lead guitar, background vocals), Dave Robbins (keyboards, background vocals), and Monte Yoho (drums, percussion)."@en ;

To date, the band has released eight studio albums, BulletBoys (1988); Freakshow (1991); Za-Za (1993); Acid Monkey (1995); Sophie (2003); 10c Billionaire (2009), Rocked and Ripped (2011), and Elefant\u00E9 (2015), as well as the live album Behind the Orange Curtain (2007)."@en ;

The band, which had a strong cult following, has released five studio albums, their first two considered the most influential. With a Hare Krishna background, they were among the first bands to fuse hardcore punk with thrash metal and were associated with the birth of a tougher attitude within the hardcore scene in the late 1980s, related to the world of martial arts. John Joseph McGowan and Harley Flanagan (formerly drummer for The Stimulators), are practitioners of boxing and Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu respectively. The Cro-Mags have gone through several line-up changes, and as of 2016, there are no constant members left in the band. According to AllMusic, \"before the Cro-Mags, the idea of combining heavy metal and hardcore together was unheard of. But with the release of their classic debut, The Age of Quarrel, hardcore-metal was born, and in its wake came a legion of similarly styled offspring (Biohazard, Vision of Disorder, etc.).\""@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Diffuser is a rock band from Long Island, New York, that was formed in 1994 by Tomas Costanza (guitar/vocals), Anthony Cangelosi (guitar), Lawrence Sullivan (bass) and Billy Alemaghides (drums). Originally the band was called Flu 13 and released a 7-inch entitled Edgar's Airwaves and an album entitled Spin Cycle before being signed to The Medicine Label. After being signed they released their second album titled In the Foul Key of V. The band signed with major label Hollywood Records in 2001 and changed their name to Diffuser. In 2001 the band released their first album on Hollywood Records titled Injury Loves Melody. Their single \"Karma\" was included on the Mission: Impossible II soundtrack; it peaked at number 20 on the Billboard Mainstream Rock Tracks chart and No. 26 on the Modern Rock Tracks chart. Lawrence and Billy left the band in 2003 and were replaced by Peter Schojan and Dan Leo on bass and drums respectively. In March the band toured the country with Simple Plan, Gob and Madcap. Their second album, Making the Grade, was released in July of that year. The songs \"I Wonder\" and \"Get It On\" were used in the 2003 movie Freaky Friday. The song \"Get It On\" also appeared on the soundtrack for the Outlaw Volleyball video game. The first 150,000 copies of the video game contained a bonus music sampler from Diffuser. In the fall of that year the band joined Hoobastank and The All-American Rejects on the Nokia Unwired Tour. The band did their final US tour in January 2004 with Spitalfield and Silverstein, followed by a tour in Japan in March. In April Hollywood Records dropped them, and they disbanded shortly after. Dan later joined Action Action with ex-members of The Reunion Show and Count the Stars. Diffuser has recently gotten back together and, according to their Myspace, plan to release a new album in spring of 2008 and re-release some Flu 13 albums. Diffuser has recently started recording the new album, posting this on their MySpace page: The album's title is Sincerely, Wasting Away. On May 24, 2008, Diffuser uploaded two new songs from the upcoming album on their MySpace page. They are entitled \"Falling Down\" and \"Free\"."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Dragon is a rock band which was formed in Auckland, New Zealand, in January 1972 and relocated later to Sydney, Australia in May 1975. They were originally fronted by singer Marc Hunter and are currently led by his brother, bass player/vocalist Todd Hunter. They performed and released material under the name Hunter in Europe and the United States during 1987. Keyboard player Paul Hewson wrote or co-wrote most of the group's 1970s hits: \"April Sun in Cuba\" peaked at #2 on the 1977 Australian singles chart; \"Are You Old Enough?\" reached #1 in 1978; and \"Still in Love with You\" reached #15 also in 1978. Later hits, from when the band re-grouped in the 1980s, were written by other band members, often working with outside associates: The Hunter brothers, with Todd's partner, Johanna Pigott, wrote \"Rain,\" a #2 hit in 1983, while other, more minor hits were written by the Hunters and/or Alan Mansfield, frequently in collaboration with any combination of Pigott, Mansfield's partner Sharon O'Neill, Marc Hunter's partner Wendy Hunter, or producers Todd Rundgren and David Hirschfelder. The name Dragon came from a consultation of I Ching cards by early band vocalist Graeme Collins. Dragon have endured tragedy, adversity and notoriety, and during the course of the band's earlier career, several members died from drug-related causes. Problems began soon after their arrival in Sydney in late 1975, when all their equipment was stolen. Several months later, in 1976, drummer Neil Storey died of a heroin overdose; Paul Hewson of a drug overdose in 1985 and Marc Hunter of smoking-related oesophageal cancer in 1998. Several members of the group including Hewson and Marc Hunter were heavy heroin users during the band's heyday, and The Stewart Royal Commission (1980\u20131983) which investigated the Mr. Asia drug syndicate obtained evidence that Dragon members were clients. Two members were involved in a serious car crash in 1977, where Paul Hewson's neck was in a brace as well as having a broken arm and Robert Taylor needed plastic surgery, and Hewson also suffered from debilitating scoliosis and arthritis, the pain of which reportedly contributed to his heroin use. The band also undertook a famously disastrous 1978 tour of the USA, supporting Johnny Winter, which ended when Marc Hunter abused the Texan audience as \"faggots\" and the band were pelted off stage, while Winter's band were said to have taken bets about how long it would be before Hunter was shot. On 1 July 2008, the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) recognised Dragon's iconic status when they were inducted into the ARIA Hall of Fame."@en ;

Founded in Baltimore, Maryland, and active since 1992, Dru Hill recorded seven Top 40 hits, and is best known for the R&B #1 hits \"In My Bed\", \"Never Make a Promise\", and \"How Deep Is Your Love\". Tamir \"Nokio\" Ruffin was the group's founder; his groupmates included lead singer Mark \"Sisq\u00F3\" Andrews, Larry \"Jazz\" Anthony, and James \"Woody Rock\" Green. Signing to Island Records through Haqq Islam's University Records imprint, the group released two successful albums, Dru Hill and Enter the Dru, before separating for a period from late 1999 to 2002, during which time Sisq\u00F3 and Woody released solo albums. While Woody's Soul Music LP was a moderate success in the gospel music industry, Sisq\u00F3's debut album, Unleash the Dragon, and its hit single, \"Thong Song\", were major pop successes, and established Sisq\u00F3 as a household name outside of Dru Hill. Sisq\u00F3's second album, Return of Dragon, did not sell as well. In 2002, by then part of the Def Soul record label, the group reunited and added fifth member Rufus \"Scola\" Waller to the lineup for their third album, Dru World Order, whose underperformance led to the group being dropped from Def Soul. In 2009, the group signed to Kedar Entertainment Group and released their fourth album, InDRUpendence Day, the following year, with new member Tao taking the place of the again departed Woody."@en ;

Although the band had strong feminist and political views in their personal lives, they generally preferred to not communicate that directly to their fans or through their music; one exception is their inclusion of the protest song \"The Partisan,\" which they began playing while on tour in the United States during the months preceding the 2004 Presidential election. The band, when playing live, had a reputation for a focused show that minimised audience interaction and rarely included more than one encore."@en ;

After Brainiac, Schmersal made a solo album under the name John Stuart Mill. Rick Lee and Steve Calhoon were both previous members of the band Skeleton Key, a befriended band Brainiac had toured with. Together they formed Enon. Lee created a number of percussion sounds for the band playing a \"junk kit\" including a Radio Flyer wagon, propane tank, and old hubcaps. After the release of their first album Believo! which was Produced by D. Sardy and signed to his SeeThru Broadcasting label in 1999, Calhoon left the band and was replaced by Toko Yasuda (bass/vocals/keyboard) and Matt Schulz (drums). Yasuda was previously in the bands Blonde Redhead, The Lapse and The Van Pelt. With the new lineup, Enon released High Society also produced by Sardy in 2002 and toured with The Faint. A majority of Enon's albums have been released on the Chicago-based indie label, Touch and Go Records after the closing of SeeThru Broadcasting. Lee left the band, and Enon went on to release Hocus Pocus in 2003, and a collection of singles and previously difficult to find internet-released songs with a bonus DVD entitled Lost Marbles & Exploded Evidence in February 2005. In 2007, all three members of Enon contributed to Les Savy Fav's album Let's Stay Friends. Yasuda also did vocal contributions to previous recordings of this band, e.g. the first track of The Cat and the Cobra. Enon released their fourth and final studio album, Grass Geysers...Carbon Clouds on Touch and Go Records on October 9, 2007. In summer 2008, drummer Matt Schulz announced that he would be leaving the group to pursue other interests. Afterwards he joined Holy Fuck as a touring member.

The group was founded in 1999 and became a prominent figure of the underground hip hop scene, known for Larsen's philosophical and socially conscious lyrics, along with Keltgen's dynamic experimental fusion of stylistic elements from both rap and rock, as well as electronic music. The group was active until Larsen's death in October 2010. Over the course of just over a decade, the duo collaborated with many well-known hip hop groups and artists such as Aesop Rock and Sage Francis, playing a preeminent role in the emerging underground rap movement. Larsen's highly successful background work in freestyle rap and rap battles, along with his greatly introspective, complex and poetic sense of lyrical integrity heavily influenced E&A's distinctive musical output and largely defined the group as a unique and stylistically independent presence within alternative hip hop."@en ;

Originally a jam band formed in the late 1990s by musicians from other bands in Wellington, Fat Freddy's Drop gradually became its members' sole focus. Band members continued playing with their other respective groups\u2014The Black Seeds, TrinityRoots, Bongmaster, and others\u2014for much of their 13-year career. Fat Freddy's Drop are known for their improvised live performances; songs on their studio albums are versions refined over years of playing them live in New Zealand, and on tour abroad. The group gained international recognition in 2003 after their single \"Midnight Marauders\" was re-distributed by record labels and DJs in Germany. The group has toured Europe nearly every year since then. The first studio album by Fat Freddy's Drop, Based on a True Story, was the first independently distributed album to reach first place in New Zealand record sales directly after release in 2005, and is the highest-selling album by a national artist in the country's history. Based on a True Story won Best Album at the New Zealand Music Awards the same year, and remained on the top 40 New Zealand sales chart for over two years, establishing them as one of the most successful contemporary bands in the island nation."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Fates Warning is an American progressive metal band, formed in 1982 by vocalist John Arch, guitarists Jim Matheos and Victor Arduini, bassist Joe DiBiase, and drummer Steve Zimmerman in Hartford, Connecticut. Their early work was heavily influenced by NWOBHM, and was key in the development of American power metal. With each work the band developed into a pure progressive metal style. Fates Warning has experienced numerous line-up changes. From 1982 to 1996 \u2014 and temporarily in 2010 \u2014 Matheos and DiBiase were the only remaining original members of the band, with Matheos being the only constant member. Their current lineup consists of guitarists Jim Matheos and Frank Aresti, vocalist Ray Alder, bassist Joey Vera, and drummer Bobby Jarzombek. As a pioneer of the American progressive metal movement, Fates Warning rose to international fame in the 1980s and was ranked as one of the early \"flagship bands of progressive metal\" along with Queensr\u00FFche, Dream Theater, Crimson Glory and Watchtower, who were responsible for creating, developing and popularizing that genre. Fates Warning has released twelve studio albums, two live albums, one compilation album, one VHS, three DVDs (each of them features live concerts) and four demo tapes. The band experienced major American commercial success with the 1986 release of their third studio album, Awaken the Guardian, which peaked at number No. 191 on the Billboard 200, and became the first album released on Metal Blade to enter that chart. Their next three albums, No Exit (1988), Perfect Symmetry (1989) and Parallels (1991), were also successful; the first two peaked at No. 111 and No. 141 on the Billboard 200 respectively. Fates Warning's most recent studio album, Theories of Flight, was released on July 1, 2016."@en ;

The band's line-up comprises lead vocalist, guitarist and keyboardist Charlie Simpson, guitarist and vocalist Alex Westaway, bassist Dan Haigh and drummer Omar Abidi. Although generally considered a post-hardcore band, Fightstar are also known to implement metal, progressive, alternative rock and acoustic elements into their sound. During the band's initial emergence, they were faced with much scepticism due to Simpson's former pop career. However, they began to receive positive reactions to early live shows and their debut EP, They Liked You Better When You Were Dead (2005), was a critical success. Since then, their four studio albums have obtained top 40 chartings and critical praise. Fightstar's debut album, Grand Unification (2006) was regarded as \"one of the best British rock albums of the past decade\" by Kerrang! editor Paul Brannigan. The band went on to receive nominations at the Kerrang! Awards for \"Best British Band\", before releasing their second album, One Day Son, This Will All Be Yours (2007). The following year a compilation album including b-sides and rarities titled, Alternate Endings (2008) was released. The band then self-funded and co-produced their third album, Be Human (2009), which heavily featured orchestral and choral elements. It became their highest charting album after peaking at number twenty in the UK Albums Chart. The band announced an extended hiatus in 2010, allowing its members to concentrate on other projects, including Simpson's solo album; before announcing their reunion in 2014."@en ;

The band released their first EP titled Aesthetic in 2003 which they recorded with founding member and vocalist Phillip Reardon who left the band in 2004 due to personal and creative differences. Dear Diary, My Teen Angst Has a Body Count followed in 2004 and Heroine in 2006, both with former vocalist Sonny Moore. Following the departure of Moore in February 2007 to work on his solo electronic project, Skrillex, the band added permanent bassist Matt Manning, and Matt Good moved to lead vocals/guitar. They released a self-titled album in 2008 on Suretone Records. On August 27, 2009, From First to Last confirmed on DJ Rossstar's Punk Rock Show that they have indeed left Suretone and are now signed to Rise Records. In late 2009, they parted ways with longtime guitarist/vocalist Travis Richter. Their fourth studio album, Throne to the Wolves was released on March 16, 2010. On July 28, 2010, the band entered a hiatus. In November 2013, From First to Last reformed after 3 years of hiatus and launched a Kickstarter campaign to fund the recording of a new EP with the return of guitarist/vocalist Travis Richter who had left the band in 2009. In April 2014 Richter and Good made a video announcement and re-recorded track teaser \"The Latest Plague\" from Heroine (2006) via Alternative Press with Periphery vocalist Spencer Sotelo confirming that Spencer was the new lead vocalist to feature on the band's upcoming second EP. In the latter part of May 2014 the new line up released a remake of the song \"Note to Self\" from Dear Diary, My Teen Angst Has a Body Count to commemorate the 10-year anniversary of the album. On January 13, 2015 the band released their eponymous lead single, \"Dead Trees\", from their recently released fifth album. The album was released on April 27, 2015 under the record label Sumerian Records as a LP and not an EP."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Funeral for a Friend were a Welsh post-hardcore band from Bridgend, formed in 2001. At the time of their disbandment, their line-up consisted of lead vocalist Matthew Davies-Kreye, guitarists Kris Coombs-Roberts and Gavin Burrough, bassist Richard Boucher and drummer Casey McHale. Funeral for a Friend's popularity rose in the United Kingdom with the release of their debut album, Casually Dressed & Deep in Conversation (2003). Achieving both a gold certification and three top twenty singles in their home country, Casually Dressed & Deep in Conversation is often acclaimed as one of the landmark emo records of the 2000s. Hours (2005) featured a similar musical style to their debut, but also featured more melodic sensibilities, and Tales Don't Tell Themselves (2007) showed an evolution in Funeral for a Friend's musical style from the style which defined their debut, as the group began to diverge from their use of screaming vocals and post-hardcore influenced guitars, favouring a more melodic rock influence. These albums achieved gold and silver sales certificates respectively in the UK. Funeral for a Friend self-released their fourth album, Memory and Humanity (2008) through their short-lived record label Join Us, the album arguably being their most eclectic to date. Following this the band tied themselves to other independent labels for Welcome Home Armageddon (2011) Conduit (2013), and Chapter and Verse (2015), which showed the band returning to the more metal and hardcore influenced style of their earlier work. In September 2015 they announced their break-up and final tour in 2016. On Saturday the 21st of May 2016, they played their last performance to a sold-out Forum in London."@en ;

The band's name is derived from the name of its creator: Terence \"Geezer\" Butler. Pedro Howse, the guitarist in the band, is Geezer's nephew."@en ;

Despite favourable reviews and a short-listing for the Mercury Prize, their 2000 d\u00E9but studio album Felt Mountain did not chart highly. Goldfrapp's second album Black Cherry, which incorporated glam rock and synthpop sounds into their music, was released in 2003. The album influenced the same dance-oriented sound of their third album Supernature. Supernature took Goldfrapp's work further into dance music, and enjoyed international chart success. The album produced three number-one US dance singles, and was nominated for Best Electronic/Dance Album at the 49th Grammy Awards. Their fourth album Seventh Tree placed a greater emphasis on ambient and downtempo music, drawing inspiration from nature and paganism, while their fifth album, Head First, found the group exploring 1980s-influenced synthpop. Head First also earned the duo their second Grammy Award nomination for Best Electronic/Dance Album in 2010. Goldfrapp released their critically acclaimed sixth studio album, the folktronica-influenced Tales of Us, in September 2013."@en ;

The band's name comes from The Gore Gore Girls, a 1972 B-movie by Herschell Gordon Lewis, which is a parody of the term Go Go Girls. Like fellow Detroit bands The White Stripes and The Detroit Cobras, the band started out struggling through the local club circuit before being \"discovered\" by independent record label Get Hip Records in 1998. Their first single \"Mama in the Movies\" (1999) gained favourable airplay on college radio stations in Michigan, which led to recording their first full-length album Strange Girls in (2000). The second album Up All Night, was released in 2002 and received positive press from the Village Voice and Detroit Free Press. During this time the band toured Europe twice, in 2002 and in 2003, also with infrequent dates in the United States. The band became a four-piece in 2004 with the addition of The Hammer (Marlene Hammerle) on guitar and began touring the United States extensively. Gore Gore Girls toured as direct support for The Cramps in 2003 and 2004. The band released an EP in 2004, 7 X 4, which became part of their third album, Get the Gore. Tracks from the EP and subsequent third album received airplay on Little Steven's Underground Garage Program on Sirius Satellite Radio; the band was featured at Little Steven's Underground Garage Festival on Randall's Island, New York along with other 'garage rock' luminaries and legends The Stooges, The Strokes, The New York Dolls, The Zombies and others. Get the Gore, released in 2007 on Bloodshot Records, was recorded at Ghetto Recorders in Detroit, Michigan and received positive press from USA Today and Playboy Magazine. Gore Gore Girls toured Europe again in spring of 2008, the band's third tour of Scandinavia and Western European countries."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Gwar, often styled as GWAR, is an American heavy metal/hardcore punk band formed in Richmond, Virginia in 1984, composed of and operated by a frequently rotating line-up of musicians, artists and filmmakers collectively known as Slave Pit Inc.. Following the death of frontman and lead singer Dave Brockie in 2014, the group has continued without any original members, although Don Drakulich, a non-instrument-performing member of the collective, has been with the band since 1985. Easily identified by their distinctively grotesque costumes, Gwar's core thematic and visual concept revolves around an elaborate science fiction-themed mythology which portrays the band members as barbaric interplanetary warriors, a narrative which serves as the basis for all of the band's albums, videos, live shows and other media. Rife with over-the-top violent, sexual, and scatological humour typically incorporating social and political satire, Gwar have attracted both acclaim and controversy for their music and stage shows, the latter of which notoriously showcase enactments of graphic violence that result in the audience being sprayed with copious amounts of fake blood, urine, and semen. Such stagecraft regularly leads Gwar to be labeled a \"shock rock\" band by the media. Since their formation, Gwar have released thirteen studio albums, two live albums, and numerous singles among other recordings, and have sold over 820,000 records in the United States. Fueled largely by the controversies surrounding their concerts, Gwar experienced brief mainstream notoriety during the first half of the 1990s, receiving regular airplay on MTV as well as frequent in-character guest appearances on daytime talk shows, satirizing the topics of censorship and media violence. Though the band's mainstream popularity declined by the end of the 1990s, Gwar has retained a dedicated cult following. The band's extensive videography consists of both live recordings and long-form feature films, most notably 1992's Phallus in Wonderland, which earned a Grammy Award nomination for Best Long Form Music Video. Outside of music and video, Gwar has expanded their franchise into comic books, trading cards, a board game, signature beers, barbecue sauces, and e-liquids."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Indian Ocean is an Indian rock band formed in New Delhi in 1990, who are widely recognized as the pioneers of the fusion rock genre in India. Susmit Sen, Asheem Chakravarty, Rahul Ram and Amit Kilam were band members till Chakravarty's death on 25 December 2009, after which Tuheen Chakravorty and Himanshu Joshi were officially inducted into the band as replacements. After the departure of Susmit Sen in 2013, Rahul Ram is the only founding member who appeared on the band's debut album Indian Ocean. The musical style of the band can be at best classified as jazz fusion and fusion music. It is an experimental genre, fusing raga (traditional Indian tunes) with rock music, guitars and drums, sometimes using Indian folk songs. It has also been described by some music critics as \"Indo-rock fusion with jazz-spiced rhythms that integrates shlokas, sufism, environmentalism, mythology and revolution\". Since 2010, the band has moved against the lines of record labels. They released their latest album 16/330 Khajoor Road online for free. The main reason for this move was the frustration over negotiating contracts with record companies and fighting over copyright issues. They have turned to concerts and sponsorships for generating revenue rather than playing in the hands of record labels. For a brief amount of time they had the sponsorship of Johnnie Walker. They are also a part of the world's first Music Personalisation Initiative named DRP as one of the five Featured Artists. In its 2014 listing of \"25 Greatest Indian Rock Songs of the last 25 Years\", \"Rolling Stone India\" featured two songs, Ma Rewa and Kandisa from the album, Kandisa (2000)."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Inspiral Carpets are an English alternative rock band, formed in 1983 in Oldham, Greater Manchester. The band's classic line-up featured founding members drummer Craig Gill and guitarist Graham Lambert along with keyboardist Clint Boon, frontman Tom Hingley, and bassist Martyn Walsh. Formed by guitarist Graham Lambert and singer Stephen Holt, the latter of which departed the band prior to the band signing with Mute Records, the band's sound was characterised by the use of organ playing and distorted guitars. The band both preceded and was a part of the late 1980s and early 1990s Madchester movement. In 2011, Tom Hingley, who featured on all of the band's studio albums during their original run, departed the band. Hingley and Boon gave conflicting accounts of his departure, with Hingley stating that he had been sacked and Boon stating that he had chosen to leave. The band continued, re-uniting with Stephen Holt who sang on the band's early material."@en ;

The group was formed in 1967 by a group of university students and it acquired widespread popularity in Chile for their song Venceremos (We shall win!) which became the anthem of the Popular Unity government of Salvador Allende. At the moment of the September 11, 1973 Chilean coup they were on tour in Europe and were unable to return to their country where their music was proscribed by the ruling military junta. In Europe their music took on a multifarious character, incorporating elements of European baroque and other traditional music forms to their rich and colourful Latin American rhythms - creating a distinctive fusion of modern world music. They are perhaps the best internationally known members of the nueva canci\u00F3n movement. Their name means 'Sun of the Illimani.' In Aymara Illimani is the name of a mountain in the Bolivian Andes. They influenced Yeni T\u00FCrk\u00FC, a Turkish group, during their debut album, Bu\u011Fday\u0131n T\u00FCrk\u00FCs\u00FC (Song of Wheat) in 1979."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Iron Savior is a German power metal band that formed in Hamburg, Germany in 1996. Following a period of several years working behind the scenes in music production, multi-instrumentalist and producer/engineer Piet Sielck joined with former Helloween bandmate Kai Hansen and then-drummer for Blind Guardian Thomen Stauch in a new project that would blend power metal with a high-concept science fiction story. The band's debut album Iron Savior introduced the story that would be told over the course of multiple albums, featuring a self-aware space vessel called the Iron Savior and its relationship to the mythical lost civilization of Atlantis. Critics have compared Iron Savior's sound and musical approach to classic heavy metal bands like Judas Priest, Iron Maiden, and Queensr\u00FFche. Kai Hansen's presence in the band brought to the Iron Savior albums on which he appeared a style heavily influenced by Gamma Ray and Helloween. Since its inception, Iron Savior has released nine studio albums, two EPs, two singles and one live album. Despite numerous lineup changes, Piet has continued to direct the band and is currently the only remaining founding member."@en ;

The band has had 16 different members in 20 years and put out 25 albums under the leadership of keyboardist/composer Brian Haas. The current lineup is Haas on piano, Fender Rhodes and synthesizers, Josh Raymer (joined 2007) on drums and Chris Combs (joined 2008) on electric guitar, lap steel, and synthesizer. JFJO's music is not easily categorized; although it is mostly in the jazz idiom, it draws from hip hop, funk and rock music. Critic Alex Henderson describes the band's music as a \"mildly avant-garde blend of jazz, rock and funk [that] draws on a wide variety of influences... Often quirky, eccentric and abstract, JFJO favors an inside/outside approach but is usually more inside than outside.\", while critic Scott Yanow describes the group as \"fascinating\". Their live shows include compositions by John Coltrane, Duke Ellington, Charles Mingus, and Thelonious Monk among others, and include long experimental improvisations that, at times, could be considered atonal. Furthermore, the band's early years as an octet featured a strong hip-hop influence. The group began with different monikers and members in the early 90s including founding members Haas and Reed Mathis, as well as Sean Layton, Dove McHargue, Matt Leland, & Kyle Wright. In 1994, after repeated viewings of This Is Spinal Tap and increased attendance at their shows, the band members agreed on \"Jacob Fred Jazz Odyssey\" as the band's new name. \"Jazz Odyssey\" coming from a scene in the aforementioned Spinal Tap comedy film and \"Jacob Fred\" being what Haas wanted his unborn brother to be named at age 3."@en ;

Toby Driver is the only founding member of the band still remaining, save for frequent lyrical contributions from former motW member Jason Byron, culminating in a guest track on the Hubardo album. Up until 2011, the lineup was constantly shifting, and Kayo Dot's sound consistently changed over the years, featuring a wide variety of instrumentation featuring guitar, drums, bass, violin, saxophone, vibraphone, synthesizers, clarinets and flutes. Underground metal audiences warmly received the group upon its early existence, with the 2003 album Choirs of the Eye and the 2006 album Dowsing Anemone with Copper Tongue both becoming underground hits in the progressive metal scene. Over the years, in addition to the rotating lineup and constantly changing sounds, Kayo Dot has been signed to a number of different record labels, Tzadik, Robotic Empire, Hydra Head before taking to Kickstarter and pre-orders to crowdfund their albums, as to be free of record label interference. The group signed to The Flenser in 2014. As of 2016, Kayo Dot has released eight studio albums, one EP and one split: Choirs of the Eye in 2003, Dowsing Anemone with Copper Tongue as well as Kayo Dot/Bloody Panda Split in 2006, Blue Lambency Downward, Coyote in 2010, an EP titled Stained Glass in 2011, Gamma Knife in 2012 and a double-album Hubardo in 2013.

The themes of their songs typically include love, friendship and relationships. Since their debut, they have sold more than 8 million albums worldwide. In November 2007, lead singer Amaia Montero announced that she would be leaving the group to begin a solo career. Her replacement, Leire Mart\u00EDnez, was announced in July 2008; the first single featuring the new singer, \"El \u00DAltimo Vals\" (The Last Waltz), was released at the same time. The album from which the single was taken, A las cinco en el Astoria, followed in September 2008. Leire was discovered on the Spanish reality show Factor X."@en ;

The band formed to accommodate Ed Kuepper's growing interest expanding the brass-driven sounds created on The Saints third album, Prehistoric Sounds, and by adopting flattened fifth notes in a rock and roll setting while using a modern jazz styled band line-up. Along with The Birthday Party, The Go-Betweens, The Moodists and The Triffids, the Laughing Clowns also sought fame in Europe during the early '80s, and gained an international cult status.

	dbo:abstract	"Leb i sol (Macedonian: \u041B\u0435\u0431 \u0438 \u0441\u043E\u043B) is a Macedonian rock group founded in the 1970s by Vlatko Stefanovski (guitar), Bodan Arsovski (bass guitar), Nikola Kokan Dimu\u0161evski (keyboards) and Garabet Tavitjan (drums). Tavitjan ceded the drumwork to Dragoljub \u0110uri\u010Di\u0107 for some of the albums, while Kiril D\u017Eajkovski replaced Kokan on Kao Kakao and Putujemo. Beside being the most eminent Macedonian band, they were also one of the most important acts of the former Yugoslav Rock scene. \"Leb i sol\" is a traditional greeting which literally translates to \"bread and salt\". It is often used as an expression of spite or determination; e.g. \"I will eat bread and salt if I have to, but I will not give in!\", but that has nothing to do with the band's name. More commonly, distinguished visitors to villages and communities would be offered a piece of home-baked bread and a dip of salt as a traditional welcome, which is where the name of the band really came from. Their music combined elements of rock, jazz fusion and ethnic Macedonian music. As the band matured, the jazz influences became less obvious. However, in concert, Leb i sol performances of jazzed-up and lengthy versions of traditional ethno-folk classics such as \"Jovano Jovanke\" or \"Aber Dojde Donke\", were often received with great enthusiasm and cheer. Leb i sol were very popular in the 1970s and 1980s and, while not selling as many records as some pop and folk acts, were very well known and respected and often sold-out venues in most of the larger cities in the former Yugoslavia. The first two albums are often considered foundational, while most are diverse enough to be, at least in part, accessible to a fairly wide audience. The influence of ethnic music and folk music of Republic of Macedonia are recognizable in the use of odd meters (5/4, 7/8) and non-traditional scales (e.g. the Phrygian dominant scale). While all the musicians were fairly accomplished, Vlatko Stefanovski is frequently regarded as an exceptional guitar virtuoso."@en ;

John Rich (bass guitar, lead and background vocals) was a member until he left in 1998, and later became one half of the duo Big & Rich, as well as a Nashville songwriter and record producer. Between 2007 and 2011, McDonald exited the band for a solo career, with former McAlyster lead singer Cody Collins replacing him as lead vocalist in this timespan. Lonestar has charted more than 20 singles on Hot Country Songs, including 9 that reached No. 1: \"No News\", \"Come Cryin' to Me\", \"Amazed\", \"Smile\", \"What About Now\", \"Tell Her\", \"I'm Already There\", \"My Front Porch Looking In\", and \"Mr. Mom\". \"Amazed\" also charted at No 1 on the Billboard Hot 100, becoming the first country song to do so since \"Islands in the Stream\" in 1983. \"Amazed\" and \"My Front Porch Looking In\" were the top country songs of 1999 and 2003, respectively, on Billboard Year-End. The group has recorded seven albums, one EP, and a greatest hits package for the defunct BNA Records, and one album each for three different independent labels. Three of their albums have been certified platinum or higher by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). The band's first two albums were defined by honky-tonk and neotraditionalist country influences, but subseuqent albums largely drew from country pop. Along with his work with the band, McDonald has co-written singles for Clay Walker, The Wilkinsons, Billy Dean, and Sara Evans, in addition to releasing two solo albums and singing guest vocals on Mindy McCready's 1996 single \"Maybe He'll Notice Her Now\"."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Madredeus (Portuguese pronunciation: [ma\u00F0\u027E\u0268\u02C8\u00F0ew\u0283]) is a Portuguese musical ensemble. Their music combines traditional Portuguese music (which is sometimes erroneously associated with the subgenre of Fado) with influences of modern folk music. The lyrics are often melancholy, related to the sea or travelling or absence, continuing a tradition of songs dating back to Medieval times (with obvious connection to cantigas de amigo among others). Madredeus founding members were Pedro Ayres Magalh\u00E3es (classical guitar), Rodrigo Le\u00E3o (keyboard synthesizer), Francisco Ribeiro (cello), Gabriel Gomes (accordion) and Teresa Salgueiro (vocals). Magalh\u00E3es and Le\u00E3o formed the band in 1985, Ribeiro and Gomes joined in 1986. In search of a female singer, they found Teresa Salgueiro in one of Lisbon's night clubs. Teresa agreed to join and, in 1987, Madredeus recorded their first album, Os dias da Madredeus. The first album was recorded in their rehearsal space, a converted abbey in Lisbon. The recording was especially strenuous due to deafening interruptions every 5 minutes from Lisbon's tram service, which ran directly above. In honour of this unavoidable presence in their every performance, they named themselves after the surrounding neighborhood, Madre de Deus (Mother of God), shortened to the vernacular Madredeus. In 1993, Pedro Ayres Magalh\u00E3es left the band temporarily and was replaced in live concerts by Jos\u00E9 Peixoto (classical guitar). Magalh\u00E3es rejoined the group later, making it a sextet with two guitarists. They released several albums and became very popular in Portugal, but remained relatively unknown abroad. This changed in 1994 when Wim Wenders, impressed by their music, asked Madredeus to perform in his movie Lisbon Story - the soundtrack gave the band international fame. Madredeus consequently toured Europe, South America, Africa and Asia. In 1994, Rodrigo Le\u00E3o left the band to start a solo career, being replaced by Carlos Maria Trindade (keyboard synthesizer). In 1997, Francisco Ribeiro and Gabriel Gomes left the band as Madredeus' style started abandoning its fado roots with the release of O Para\u00EDso. At this time Fernando J\u00FAdice (Acoustic bass guitar) was invited to join them. The group would, again, be a quintet.Madredeus has sold over 3 million albums worldwide. In 1998, Madredeus contributed \"Os Dias S\u00E3o A Noite (Suso Saiz Remix)\" to the AIDS benefit compilation album Onda Sonora: Red Hot + Lisbon produced by the Red Hot Organization. In November 2007, Teresa Salgueiro announced she had left Madredeus and she has released six solo albums until now. Former member and co-founder Francisco Ribeiro released his first solo album Desiderata: A Jun\u00E7\u00E3o do Bem in 2009. He died on 14 September 2010 from cancer. In April 2012 Madredeus announced its new album Essencia. This album is a travel through Madredeus music for 25 years since it was formed. Madredeus announced too its new formation, composed of Beatriz Nunes (singer), Pedro Ayres de Magalh\u00E3es (guitar), Carlos Maria Trinidade (synthesizer), Jorge Varrecoso (violin), Antonio Figueirido (violin) and Luis Clode (cello). With this new formation Pedro Ayres said in an interview: \"The melody is much more supported, without losing harmonic and rhythmic sense and keeps walking Madredeus\"."@en ;

Magnapop first achieved recognition in the Benelux countries of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg through the festival circuit and have remained popular in Europe throughout their career. After modest success in the United States in the mid-1990s with the singles \"Slowly, Slowly\" and \"Open the Door\" and a series of albums produced by Michael Stipe, Bob Mould, and Geza X, the band went on an extended hiatus due to the dissolution of their record label. They returned with a new rhythm section in 2005 on the Daemon Records release Mouthfeel. The band has continued to perform and record since this reunion and have self-released two more albums. Magnapop's musical style is noted for blending the pop vocals and melodies of Hopper with the aggressive, punk-influenced guitar-playing of Morris and her back-up vocal harmonies."@en ;

The group's current line-up consists of vocalist/guitarist Fher Olvera, drummer Alex \"El Animal\" Gonz\u00E1lez, guitarist Sergio Vall\u00EDn, and bassist Juan Calleros. Man\u00E1 has earned four Grammy Awards, eight Latin Grammy Awards, five MTV Video Music Awards Latin America, six Premios Juventud awards, nineteen Billboard Latin Music Awards and fifteen Premios Lo Nuestro awards. It is considered by many as the most influential and successful Latin American band of all time with over 40 million albums sold worldwide. Man\u00E1 has topped the all-time lists in much of Latin America and in their native Mexico, where they set landmarks in record sales and concert attendances. The band formed in 1986 and released its first album, Falta Amor, in 1990. In 1992, the group released \u00BFD\u00F3nde Jugar\u00E1n Los Ni\u00F1os?, which sold more than 10 million copies worldwide, (over 700,000 copies in the US alone) becoming the best selling Spanish-language rock album of all time. After several lineup changes, the group released Cuando los \u00C1ngeles Lloran (1995), which is noted for its stylistic departure from the band's previous work. Man\u00E1 followed with Sue\u00F1os L\u00EDquidos (1997), Revoluci\u00F3n de Amor (2002), and Amar es Combatir (2006), which continued the group's success. The band followed up with Drama y Luz in April 2011. Their most recent album is Cama Incendiada, which was released in early 2015. The band's sound draws from pop rock, Latin pop, calypso, reggae and ska music genres. They initially received international commercial success in Australia and Spain and have since gained popularity and exposure in the US, Western Europe, Asia, and the Middle East."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Mokoma is a Finnish thrash metal band formed in Lappeenranta in 1996. Their music also has grindcore and death metal influences with traditional Finnish melancholy. Mokoma started out as a creation of Marko Annala, who is the band's lead singer, and has been the band's only original bandmember. The name comes from Annala's former girlfriends' Karelian grandmother, who said \"Voi siuta mokomaa\". That means \"Oh gosh, you and your tricks\", basically in simple words when put into English. Mokoma is similar but slightly more gracious word to \"damned\" or \"accursed\". Through the years several members have come and gone, but only Marko has remained constant. The band started out as a more traditional rock band with their first two albums \"Valu\" and \"Mokoman 120 p\u00E4iv\u00E4\u00E4\". However, both albums sold badly and they were eventually dropped when they suggested to their record company (EMI), that they wanted to play something more closer to their hearts, thrash metal. The group moved on and created their own record company, called Sakara Records, and released their third album \"Kurimus\", which is sometimes regarded as the first thrash metal album sung in Finnish. That was the first release of the members' independent record company Sakara Records. Since then they have released seven more albums and an EP called \"Viides vuodenaika\", which reached position one in the Finnish albums chart. Their latest album release is \"El\u00E4vien kirjoihin\"."@en ;

In fall 2004, Torsten Pr\u00F6frock became a member of Monolake. Monolake's minimal, dub-influenced techno music helped establish the sound of the Chain Reaction label, also located in Berlin, subsequently using their own [ml/i] (Monolake / Imbalance Computer Music) label for the group's output. Both current members have solo projects, with Henke releasing under his own name and Pr\u00F6frock as \"T++\" and \"Various Artists.\" In 2008 T++ followed Ricardo Villalobos in bridging the gap between minimal techno and dubstep, by remixing Shackleton's Death Is Not Final for the Skull Disco label. In 2009, Robert Henke appeared in the electronic music documentary Speaking In Code which presented the completion of the Monodeck. As of 2012, Henke has been designing a new form of live show syncing surround-sound audio stems with visual loops, allowing for improvisation.

Under the band's original line-up, they released two EPs, Hugh Chardon and Indy. Original singer Zak Ward switched to keyboards and samples in 2002 (while sometimes still providing additional vocals both live and in studio) and was replaced by Ivan \"Ghost\" Moody which led to the release of their first studio album Motograter in 2003. The band went on an indefinite hiatus in 2005, disbanded after playing a one-time reunion show in 2006, and then reformed with a new line-up in 2008, featuring singer Michael \"Angel\" Woodruff. They released the EP Pre-Release in 2009, and toured until the band's second split up in 2011. The band reunited again in late 2013, performing at Slipknot's Knotfest the next year. In December 2014, Woodruff left Motograter, replacing him with James Anthony Legion in early 2015.

The group first found success in Europe after the release of their debut album, The Tennessee Fire (1999). Their next release, At Dawn (2001), led to a large stateside following and preceded several lineup changes. After signing to major label ATO Records, the group released two albums, It Still Moves (2003) and Z (2005), with the latter representing a critical breakthrough. Their next release, Evil Urges (2008), was more polarizing for fans and critics, while Circuital (2011), their sixth album, saw a more measured response. After many years of side projects and touring, the band's seventh album, The Waterfall, was released in 2015."@en ;

Initially called Hell's Half-Acre, the band's name comes from Ted Nugent's introduction to \"Wang Dang Sweet Poontang\" on the Double Live Gonzo album. Following the initial 1997 breakup of Kentucky cowpunk band Nine Pound Hammer, guitarist Blaine Cartwright formed Nashville Pussy where he would take up vocal duties in addition to guitar. The core lineup of Nashville Pussy consists of husband-and-wife duo Blaine Cartwright and Ruyter Suys (pronounced \"Rider Sighs\"), and drummer Jeremy Thompson. Original drummer Adam Neal (Nine Pound Hammer) left to form The Hookers. Original bassist Corey Parks (sister of former NBA basketball player Cherokee Parks) quit one month after the release of the album High as Hell, and later joined Die Hunns. Tracy Almazan aka Tracy Kickass formerly of NYC's The Wives, and Helldorado was enlisted to replace Parks mid-tour. Nashville Pussy recorded Say Something Nasty with Almazan on bass only to be replaced by Katielyn Campbell (of the band Famous Monsters). Katie Lynn's image is on the album Say Something Nasty. Campbell was subsequently replaced by Karen Cuda for the album Get Some. Karen Cuda also appeared as bassist on the album \"From Hell To Texas\", and in the live DVD Live in Hollywood.

This gives the band a tense and highly driven sub-hardcore sound featuring distorted effects-laden guitar and energetic drums. The band was formed while at sixth form college and they recorded their first album while some of the members were still teenagers. This led to a strong teenaged fanbase with a reputation for enjoying crowd surfing and moshing at their gigs. The band was also noted (and occasionally ridiculed) for their early image, which consisted of uniformly crimped hair and a predilection for sporting shorts and band or skateboard T-shirts. \"The Neds\" (as their fans referred to them) were well known for their own distinctive T-shirts, reportedly producing over 86 different designs within three years (1987\u20131990).

	dbo:abstract	"Nortec Collective is a musical ensemble formed by various individual one or two man production projects. The group came together in Tijuana, Baja California, Mexico. Their sound genre mixes electronica with musical elements and instrumentation of Tambora and Norte\u00F1o music, resulting in the nortec (\"norte\u00F1o\" + \"techno\") style. The various projects began producing and performing Nortec music around 1999. In 2001, they were signed to a recording contract with Palm Pictures, that released their first album \"Tijuana Session Volume 1\" under the name Nortec Collective. The line-up for that album included Bostich, Clorofila, Fussible, Hiperboreal, Panoptica, Plankton Man and Terrestre. The latter two would leave Nortec Collective in 2002. Nortec Collective's second album, Tijuana Sessions, Vol. 3, (Nacional Records) received much critical praise and was nominated for two Latin Grammy awards in 2006. In 2008, Nortec Collective ceased to function as a proper collective, with the various individual projects performing and recording separately. According to the Collective's Myspace page, \"For the time being, Nortec Collective has decided to release music separately \u2026\" and \"Until further notice, there will be not be any bookings for Nortec, Nortec Collective or Colectivo Nortec with the full four member line-up.\" The various individual projects went on to release and perform separately. 2008's Tijuana Sound Machine by Bostich and Fussible (also Nacional Records) was nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Latin Rock/Alternative Album. The Nortec Collective has borrowed several elements of Banda music sub-culture and have used them both in their songs (Narcoteque, Almada) and in their visuals and album covers."@en ;

The name VIA Gra is both a reference to the drug Viagra and a play on words, since the first three letters stand for \"vocal-instrumental ensemble\" in Ukrainian, and \"hra\" means \"game\" in Ukrainian and it is also kind of a signature of the surnames of the two first girls of the group, VI-nnitskay-A and GRA-novskaya, the originally used maiden name of Nadya Meikher. Nu Virgos was a Ukrainian girl group that hit the charts in these countries in September 2000 with their first single \"Popytka No. 5\". Their first success outside the Russian language area was in May 2004 with the single \"Stop! Stop! Stop!\", an English version of their 2002 Russian song. The group is known for their frequent lineup changes, with 13 different individuals having at one time been in the group. The group was co-created by Dmitriy Kostyuk and Konstantin Meladze. Kostyuk is the manager of the group and the co-producer of the group's albums. Meladze is the writer of the group's songs and the co-producer of the group's albums."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Okkervil River is an American rock band led by singer-songwriter Will Sheff. Formed in Austin, Texas in 1998, the band takes its name from a short story by Russian author Tatyana Tolstaya set on the river in St Petersburg. They began as a trio made up of Sheff and friends he'd met in his native state of New Hampshire but, over time, have gone through many lineups. Okkervil River self-released their first album, Stars Too Small to Use, which led them to the South by Southwest music festival. After recording their first album in a garage, they signed with Jagjaguwar. They continued by releasing four more albums, including the critically lauded concept album Black Sheep Boy. After a period of touring for Black Sheep Boy, Okkervil River followed up with The Stage Names. The album sold 10,000 in its opening week in the United States. The group released a free covers album, Golden Opportunities Mixtape from their live performances. The band has garnered positive critical reception. They have appeared on the talk show Late Night with Conan O'Brien and have performed with acts such as The Decemberists, The New Pornographers, The National, and Lou Reed. Okkervil River released the album The Stand Ins on 9 September 2008. They promoted the release with a series of cover songs from the album on YouTube by people they've met as a band. Their 2010 collaboration as a backing band with psychedelic rocker Roky Erickson yielded True Love Cast Out All Evil. On 10 May 2011, Okkervil River released their sixth full-length album, I Am Very Far, which peaked at No. 32 on the Billboard 200. The band released their seventh album, The Silver Gymnasium, on 3 September 2013. The album peaked at No. 66 on the Billboard 200. The band\u2019s most recent album, Away, was released on September 9th, 2016 on ATO Records."@en ;

After the Lennons' move to New York, they began collaborating with Elephant's Memory, under the moniker of the \"Plastic Ono Elephant's Memory Band\". Lennon's collaborations continued under similar names, until the winding down of the concept in 1974.

Their song lyrics often consist of Japanese, English, or just plain gibberish.

	dbo:abstract	"Thirty Seconds to Mars (commonly stylized as 30 Seconds to Mars) is an American rock band from Los Angeles, California, formed in 1998. The band consists of Jared Leto (lead vocals, guitar, bass, keyboards), Shannon Leto (drums, percussion) and Tomo Mili\u010Devi\u0107 (lead guitar, bass, violin, keyboards, other instruments). The band's debut album, 30 Seconds to Mars (2002), was produced by Bob Ezrin and released to positive reviews but only to limited commercial success. The band achieved worldwide fame with the release of their second album A Beautiful Lie (2005), which received multiple certifications all over the world, including platinum in the United States. Their next release, This Is War (2009), showed a dramatic evolution in the band's musical style, as they incorporated experimental music as well as eclectic influences. The recording process of the album was marked by a legal dispute with record label EMI that eventually became the subject of the documentary film Artifact (2012). Thirty Seconds to Mars then moved to Universal Music and released the fourth album, Love, Lust, Faith and Dreams (2013), to critical and commercial success. As of September 2014, the band has sold over 15 million albums worldwide. Thirty Seconds to Mars has consistently enjoyed sold out tours and numerous headlining festival slots. The band is noted for its energetic live performances and for fusing many music genres. They have been compared to the sounds of bands such as Pink Floyd, The Cure, Tool, and U2, for their philosophical and spiritual lyrics, concept albums and their use of experimental music. Thirty Seconds to Mars has received several awards and accolades throughout their career, including a Guinness World Record, and has been included in the Kerrang! list of best artists of the 2000s."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Wolfmother is an Australian hard rock band from Sydney, New South Wales. Formed in 2000 by vocalist and guitarist Andrew Stockdale, bassist and keyboardist Chris Ross, and drummer Myles Heskett, the group currently includes Stockdale, bassist and keyboardist Ian Peres, and touring drummer Alex Carapetis. Wolfmother released their self-titled debut album Wolfmother in Australia in 2005, and internationally in 2006, which has since sold over 1.5 million copies worldwide and won the band a number of industry awards. Ross and Heskett left the band in 2008. Stockdale returned with a new lineup featuring Peres, rhythm guitarist Aidan Nemeth and drummer Dave Atkins in 2009, releasing Cosmic Egg later in the year. After more personnel changes, the group's planned third album was released in 2013 as Keep Moving, a Stockdale solo album. Later that year, Wolfmother returned as a trio featuring Peres and drummer Vin Steele for 2014's New Crown. The band's fourth album, Victorious, featured two guest drummers and was released in 2016. Wolfmother have been categorised by various commentators within the genres of hard rock, heavy metal, stoner rock and psychedelic rock. They are often compared to influential classic rock and metal bands from the 1960s and 1970s, including Led Zeppelin, Black Sabbath, Blue Cheer and AC/DC. Frontman Stockdale has typically led songwriting for the group, although the material on the band's debut album was co-credited to Ross and Heskett. Stockdale also produced New Crown and performed bass on Victorious."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"XP8 was an Italian electronic group. The band started in 2001 as a trio, composed of Marco Visconti, Marko Resurreccion, and singer Paul Toohill. The group self-released an album, Forgive on MP3.com. When they signed to the Polish label Black Flames Records, their album was released as Forgive[n] in May 2004. An EP of new material, RE_Productions, was released five months later. In 2005, the band released their second album, Hrs:Min:Sec, on the German label Infacted Recordings. Toohill left the band in 2007, to work on his solo project, Generator. He is also the main singer for a Nitzer Ebb tribute band called \"Muscle And Hate\". Their third album, The Art of Revenge, was released in January 2008 on Infacted. It was also licensed to Sigsaly Transmissions for North America and Gravitator Records for Russia the same year. A music video, the band's first, was produced for the album's title track. Over the years, the band played all over Europe, from their native Italy to Russia, as well as performing at festivals like Wave-Gotik-Treffen in Germany. In 2008, XP8 also reached US shores for the first time with their live show, supporting System Syn on a one-month promotional tour. The following year they played at the Kinetik Festival in Canada, and begun working on their fourth studio album Drop The Mask, which was released in early 2010 once again by Infacted Recordings, with the digital-only Want It coming up just a few months before.Straying away from a pure dancefloor sound, the band experimented also with different approaches to electronica, and the album immediately received good praises by the press, consecrating it as the most mature XP8 release to date.Soon afterwards the album was licensed to Metropolis Records for a North American released and peaked at number 1 on the label's mailorder a week before its street date, while a limited digipack edition with a bonus CD was released in Japan by Deathwatch Asia. XP8 is also well known for their remixes, having reworked tracks of several other bands, including Steve Aoki, Attrition, Mortiis, and Icon of Coil, and countless others. In 2013, XP8 released the crowd-funded concept album Adrenochrome, which they described as their best effort to date, without any record label support. Everything came to a grinding halt in 2014 when the band decided to disband, quoting various reasons for this decision, among them the dwindling interest in alternative/industrial dance music, a trend that had a long run for almost two decades but that eventually ran dry. In an interview, Visconti also stated that \u201C[...] no one wants to be the old guy in a room full of kids looking at you like a dinosaur: I remember vividly making fun of those old goths that simply didn\u2019t want to get the fuck out of MY clubs a decade ago, and the last thing I wanted to become was one of them.\u201D  - clearly pointing out the necessity to make space for a younger generation to make things vital and vibrant once again. Before disbanding, XP8 released a series of 3 EPs over a period of 9 months, each released tied to one of the phases of the Alchemical process: the three releases went on to be praised as the band's best material by critics and fans alike, proving how the Italian duo left a mark on the industrial scene for years and years to come. Steven Gullotta at Brutal Resonance stated that \"XP8 may be dead, but their music will forever hold a place within my soul\", giving the band a good send off."@en ;

Despite initial success, Mission of Burma disbanded in 1983 due to Miller's development of tinnitus caused by the volume of the band's live performances. In its original lineup, the band released only two singles, an EP, and one LP, Vs.
