<http://dbpedia.org/resource/I_Don\u0027t_Care_Anymore_(George_Harrison_song)>	rdf:type	dbo:MusicalWork ;
	dbo:abstract	"\"I Don't Care Anymore\" is a song by English musician George Harrison, released as the B-side to the lead single from his 1974 album Dark Horse. The A-side was \"Dark Horse\" in the majority of countries internationally and \"Ding Dong, Ding Dong\" elsewhere, including the United Kingdom. It is one of Harrison's relatively rare compositions in the country music genre and, equally unusual among his 1970s releases, the recording is a solo performance by him. Harrison wrote \"I Don't Care Anymore\" during a period of personal upheaval, with the end of his marriage to Pattie Boyd. The song is a love song, in which he express his desire for a woman who appears to be married. Harrison recorded the track in Los Angeles in October 1974, in a single take. His hoarse vocals reflect the onset of laryngitis as he rushed to complete his album while rehearsing for a North American tour. Several commentators hold the song in low regard, finding the literal message in the title mirrored in Harrison's overly casual performance. Along with \"Deep Blue\" and \"Miss O'Dell\", \"I Don't Care Anymore\" was one of three non-album B-sides issued by the artist during the 1970s. Having been unavailable officially for 40 years after its initial release, the song was included as a bonus track on the 2014 Apple Years 1968\u201375 reissue of Dark Horse."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"Make Me Like You\" is a song by American singer and songwriter Gwen Stefani for her upcoming third solo studio album This Is What the Truth Feels Like (2016). Released as the album's second single, the song was first released digitally on February 12, 2016, while being serviced to contemporary hit radio four days later, on February 16, 2016. Stefani co-wrote the song with Justin Tranter, Julia Michaels, and its producers Mattman & Robin. It is a pop and disco song, with influences of light rock, with its instrumentation consisting of chiming guitars, \"digi-harps\" and a \"beachy\" drum progression. Considered a departure from her previous single, \"Used to Love You\" (2015), \"Make Me Like You\" is about feeling renewed and finding love again following a fractured relationship. Many critics believed the song was inspired by her relationship with American singer Blake Shelton, which was later confirmed by Stefani. The song received acclaim from music critics, who praised the track's upbeat environment and its radio-friendly vibe. The music video for the song was the first to be created on live television and it was recorded during the 2016 Grammy Awards commercial break. Stefani's long-time collaborator, Sophie Muller, directed the video which involved several costume changes and various scenes, including a car crash, a salon, and a piano lounge. It also pokes fun at the media scrutiny over her personal life. The video garnered a positive reaction from critics, for being \"colorful\" and \"entertaining\"."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"Goin' Down\" is a song by the American pop rock band the Monkees, written by all four members of the group along with Diana Hildebrand, and was first released as the B-side to the \"Daydream Believer\" single on Colgems Records on 25 October 1967 in support of the band's fifth album, The Birds, the Bees & the Monkees (see 1967 in music). It is the only composition recorded by the Monkees that is credited to all its members, and managed to bubble under the Billboard Hot 100 upon its distribution. Lyrically, \"Goin' Down\" describes a man who's relationship had ended, and attempts to \"end it all\" by leaping into the river to be dragged away in the current. He almost immediately regrets the decision and comes to a self-realization, before coming to shore in New Orleans to partake in its \"swingin' scenes\". It features energetic, rapid lead vocals by Micky Dolenz, and big band influences that are melded into the pop song, with the arrangements organized by jazz musician Shorty Rogers. With \"Daydream Believer\", as the song's A-side, reaching number one on the Billboard Hot 100, \"Goin' Down\" managed to chart at number 104 nationally. Since its release, the composition has become a staple of the Monkees' touring setlists, with a live version of the song appearing on the album 2001: Live in Las Vegas. An extended rendition of \"Goin' Down\" also appears on the deluxe version of Pisces, Aquarius, Capricorn & Jones Ltd., Greatest Hits, The Best of the Monkees, and Extended Versions. In 2012, the composition was met with controversary for its unexpected use in the television show, Breaking Bad. Dolenz, who was unaware \"Goin' Down\" was to be featured on the show, chimmed in, saying, \"'Goin\u2019 Down' has nothing to do with drugs, obviously. And I certainly don't condone meth -- that is nasty stuff that kills a lot of people and ruins a lot of lives. ... On the other hand, I like the TV show, it's very well-made. \u2026 And no, I didn't make a penny\"."@en ;

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/I\u0027ll_Have_to_Let_Him_Go>	rdf:type	dbo:MusicalWork ;
	dbo:abstract	"\"I'll Have to Let Him Go\" is a 1962 song and single written, composed and produced by William \"Mickey\" Stevenson and issued on the Gordy (Motown) label. it is notable for being one of two singles that marked the Motown debut of Martha and the Vandellas. The song is about ending a romantic relationship, as its narrator, after seeing her lover kissing and holding another, realizing its over and decides she going \u201Cto set him free\u201D even though \"it's gonna hurt (her) so\". Originally recorded when the group was just renamed the Vels (from the Del-Phis), the song was one of the first of many recordings led by Martha Reeves. Original member Gloria Williams was the groups lead singer up till this point. The song was intended for Mary Wells, but when Wells couldn't make the session, Martha, then an assistant and secretary to Stevenson, was asked to sing it in her place as a demo record, and she recruited her groupmates Rosalind Ashford, Gloria Williams and Annette Beard to back her. The performance so impressed Stevenson and label president Berry Gordy that they signed the group to the label, decided to release the song as a single, and recorded another single for release, the Williams led \"You'll Never Cherish A Love So True('Til You Lose It)\" / \"There He Is (At My Door)\". But by the time of its release the Vels would become first \"the Vandellas\" and then finally \"Martha and the Vandellas\". Also around this time, Williams would leave the quartet, deciding that show business was too rigorous, making them a trio from then onward. The Williams-led single was released at the same time as this one, but on the Mel-O-Dy subsidiary and still credited to \"the Vells\" [sic]. Neither singles charted, but five months later they would release their first hit single, \"Come and Get These Memories\". The flip side \"My Baby Won't Come Back\" was co-written by Reeves and Stevenson, and produced by the latter. It was recorded by the Marvelettes on the same day as Reeves and her group' version, May 8, 1962, but their version would not be released until 2011."@en ;

dbr:The_Girl_I_Knew_Somewhere	rdf:type	dbo:MusicalWork ;
	dbo:abstract	"\"The Girl I Knew Somewhere\" is a song by the American pop rock band the Monkees, written by Michael Nesmith, and first released as the B-side to the \"A Little Bit Me, a Little Bit You\" single on Colgems Records on 8 March 1967 (see 1967 in music). It was distributed in support of the group's third album Headquarters, and later appeared on the reissued version of the LP. The song was recorded as the Monkees finally achieved the independence that enabled them to freely produce their own material, with the actual band members being featured on both vocals and instrumental arrangements. The Monkees had enjoyed enormous commercial success with their first two albums, The Monkees and More of the Monkees, both reaching number one on the Billboard 200. However, under the direction of their music supervisor Don Kirshner, the group was almost completely barred from studio work, aside from recording as vocalists and penning some original material. Longing to achieve creative freedom, the Monkees, lead by Michael Nesmith, who felt especially insulted by Kirshner's condescension, entered months of bitter negotiations that eventually concluded with Kirshner's firing. With his departure, the band was finally given the ability to play the instrumentals themselves, making the Headquarters sessions the first of which to feature the actual members on the arrangements. Nesmith compared the Monkees' process to build upon their differing styles: \"[It was like] a really good tennis player, and a really good football player, and a really good basketball player, and a really good golfer got together and played baseball. ... We could give it a try. Maybe make a little garage-band music\". Although it was unbeknownst to the record-buying public upon its release, \"The Girl I Knew Somewhere\" was the first song recorded by the Monkees to contain vocals and instrumentals performed by the band members. It was first recorded on 19 January 1967 with Nesmith on lead vocals; however, a second version was taken on 23 February 1967, with Micky Dolenz replacing him to create a more commercialized sound. The song became very accessible with its breezy melodic shifts, catchy rhythm, and relatable lyrics. Upon release, \"The Girl I Knew Somewhere\" charted at number 39 on the Billboard Hot 100, while its A-side \"A Little Bit Me, a Little Bit You\" propelled to number two. Since its original distribution, the composition has been featured on nearly all the Monkees' compilation albums, with it first appearing on 40 Timeless Hits in 1980. An early demo of \"The Girl I Knew Somewhere\" is compiled on The Headquarters Sessions, along with a rendition with additional backing vocals, and a stereo version was first released on More Greatest Hits of the Monkees."@en ;

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/There_He_Is_(At_My_Door)>	rdf:type	dbo:MusicalWork ;
	dbo:abstract	"\"There He Is (At My Door)\" is a 1962 song and B-side single written and composed by all three line-ups of what would soon be Motown's main production team (Holland\u2013Dozier\u2013Holland with Eddie Holland's predecessor Janie Bradford, and her predecessor Freddie Gorman). Credited to the Vells the performers on both sides of the single were an early version of the group that would be better known as Martha and the Vandellas. The single is also notable as the last one the label subsidiary would release under an R&B/soul music format, changing that point onward to a country music subsidiary. The song's narrator tells of how she's trying to resist going back to her former lover, who keeps \"knocking at (her) door\", because \"that's when heartaches will start again\". Originally it was the B-side to the Berry Gordy production, \"You'll Never Cherish A Love So True ('Til You Lose It)\", whose narrator is warning her man that he better start treating her right before she leaves him and \"there'll be no shoulder\" for him to lean on. During this period 'the Vels' (the correct spelling of the group's name) main lead singer was founding member Gloria Williams (a.k.a. Gloria Jean Williamson) who leads both sides of this single; group member Rosalind Ashford, in a rare appearance out front, has a spoken part on the A-side's bridge. However, before the single's release, a frustrated Williams decided that the music business was too risky to rely on as a constant income, and left the group. Motown went ahead and released the single anyway on the Mel-O-Dy label (with the group's name misspelled), while (almost) simultaneously releasing the group's single \"I'll Have to Let Him Go\" / \"My Baby Won't Come Back\" on the Gordy label; this marks a double debut of the group on the label, with the latter single also being the debut of the group's new name, Martha and the Vandellas. \"There He Is\", actually received more airplay than its A-side, but neither side of both singles charted. The Vandellas later made a second version of \"There He Is\", but with Reeves lead vocals over the original Instrumental and backing vocal track (and the knocking sound removed). This version would first appear on the group's 1963 debut album, Come and Get These Memories, and then reappear on the B-side of their Top Ten hit single \"Dancing in the Street\", and the album Dance Party."@en ;

It was written and produced by Wayne Wilkins and Steve Kipner with an additional writing from Andre Merrit. She spoke of an instant connection to the message of the song as well as the noticeable synthy production. The up-tempo pop, dance-pop and R&B song revolves around a lyrical content of not giving up on the partner; it was promoted around most of the world at a time when Cole's marriage to footballer Ashley Cole was breaking down. \"Fight for This Love\" divided music critics; some praised Cole's vocals and the powerful production, noting that it had the potential to be a hit with the clubs while other critics criticised the sluggish verses and weak vocals. The accompanying music video was directed by Ray Kay and features Cole wearing various fashionable outfits whilst the scenes featured different choreographed dance routines. It was generally well received by media and critics who drew comparisons to the works of Janet Jackson and the video for \"Put the Needle On It\" (2002) by Dannii Minogue. Following her first performance of the song on The X Factor it topped charts in Ireland and the United Kingdom. In May 2010 it was certified platinum by the British Phonographic Industry for shipments topping 600,000 units.

As Hilson's second vocal collaboration with mentor Timbaland, Hilson stated the purpose of the song's initial conception was to re-create the success of their worldwide hit, \"The Way I Are\", as Timbaland called the \"Return the Favor\" bigger and better. Contemporary critics gave the song mixed reviews, noting the production and vocal similarities to \"The Way I Are\", preferring the latter track. The song reached the top twenty in the United Kingdom, Ireland, and Germany, while appearing in the top thirty of Austria and Sweden, charting in Australia and the tip charts in Belgium. The accompanying music video implements a futuristic concept and features Hilson sporting several extravagant outfits."@en ;

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mister,_You\u0027re_a_Better_Man_Than_I>	rdf:type	dbo:MusicalWork ;
	dbo:abstract	"\"Mister, You're a Better Man Than I\", alternately listed as \"Mr. You're a Better Man Than I\" and simply as \"You're a Better Man Than I\", is a song first recorded by the English rock band the Yardbirds. It was written by brothers Mike and Brian Hugg, and was introduced as the B-side to the \"Shapes of Things\" single in February 1966 (see 1966 in music). The song also appears as the opening track to the Having a Rave Up with The Yardbirds album, released a year prior to the single. With its politically-conscientious lyrics and catchy melody, \"Mister, You're a Better Man Than I\" has been covered several times. The most successful rendition was recorded by American garage rock band Terry Knight and the Pack, who earned a minor national hit with the tune. With the exception of \"Still I'm Sad\", the composition, like other tracks on Having a Rave Up with The Yardbirds, was not penned by any of the band members. Nonetheless, \"Mister, You're a Better Man Than I\", along with \"Shapes of Things\", is perhaps the best example of Jeff Beck's experimentation with distorted guitar instrumentals and use of feedback in the Yardbirds' recordings. Also like \"Shapes of Things\", the composition incorporated elements of psychedelic rock. Lyrically, the song makes a statement directed toward issues concerning the era such as judging others based on race, government intervention, and use of violence. Music critic Matthew Greenwald, writing on the Allmusic website, notes the tune as a successful attempt at producing contemporary folk rock without \"compromising the band's dark, threatening lyrics\". In February 1966, Terry Knight and the Pack recorded their own version of \"Mister, You're a Better Man Than I\" (shortened to \"You're a Better Man Than I\" upon release) after hearing the Yardbirds perform the song at a gig in Michigan. Writing on the musical career of Terry Knight, music historian Barry Stroller described the Pack's rendition as a \"bona-fide classic\", before commending its \"surprisingly subtle delivery, basic electric guitar chords supported gently with organ and rhythm section, Knight brilliantly finds (admittedly in lyrics he did not write) a perfect narrative in which to grow from teeniebopper heartthrob to social voice of conscience\". The song was the first recording by the group to chart nationally, bubbling under the Billboard charts at number 125. Regionally, \"You're a Better Man Than I\" also reached the Top 10 of several radio charts, and overall sold approximately 150,000 copies. Since the Yardbirds' original version, \"Mister, You're a Better Man Than I\" has been interpreted by other groups. Chicago-based garage rock band New Colony Six featured the composition on their debut album Breakthrough in June 1966. In 1969, Manfred Mann Chapter Three released the song on their self-titled debut. The song was particularly popular among teen groups in Fort Worth, Texas, and was covered by the Cynics and Jinx. These interpretations have become more accessible with their inclusion on Fort Worth Teen Scene! albums."@en ;

dbr:Better_than_Today	rdf:type	dbo:MusicalWork ;
	dbo:abstract	"\"Better than Today\" is a song recorded by Australian singer Kylie Minogue for her eleventh studio album, Aphrodite (2010). The track was originally written and produced by Nerina Pallot and Andy Chatterley for Pallot's 2009 extended play, Buckminster Fuller EP. It was re-recorded by Minogue in 2009, and received additional production by Stuart Price. Musically, \"Better than Today\" is a pop song that emulates other styles using guitars, synthesizers and drum programming. \"Better than Today\" was released on 3 December 2010 as the album's third single. It was not as successful as Minogue's preceding releases. After debuting on the chart early with album downloads, it peaked on the UK Singles Chart at number 32, making it her lowest placing since \"The One\" in 2008. The single was released in Australia on 28 February 2011. It debuted on the ARIA Singles Chart at number 55, making it her third single to miss the top-fifty, after \"Finer Feelings\" in 1992 (number 60) and \"Get Outta My Way\" in 2010 (number 69). Despite under-performing in the United Kingdom and Australia, it became Minogue's sixth number-one on the US Hot Dance Club Songs chart and her third consecutive number-one single from the album Aphrodite on that chart. \"Better than Today\" received mixed reviews from contemporary music critics. They applauded the dance-oriented lyrics, comparing the track's composition to Minogue's works in the early 1990s on Rhythm of Love and the songs of the Scissor Sisters. Many critics praised the song as a part of the album, but did not believe it was strong as an independent single. An accompanying music video, directed by Minogue and her tour staff, was released on 19 November 2010. The video reflected the fashion and choreography of the performances done during her 2009 For You, For Me Tour, where she debuted the song. Reception for the video was mainly positive, with most publications noting its similarities to Minogue's previous music videos."@en ;

It was released as a digital single on December 26, 2007, as the third of three pre-release songs from the band's second album Night Fishing (2008), released a month later. The song was written by the band's vocalist and songwriter Ichiro Yamaguchi to mimic the emotions of fishing, inspired by musicals and classical music. Musically, the band were inspired by the English rock band Queen, adding guitar riffs and choral vocals similar to the style of Queen. The song was the first instance of Sakanaction using choral vocals in their music. Yamaguchi wanted the song to act as the leading promotional song from Night Fishing, however the band's record label insisted on the song \"Sample\" instead. Yamaguchi personally pushed for the song to have a music video. He enlisted the director Yoshihiro Mori to create a video with little notice, and together they created a fishing-themed documentary-style video shot in Gifu, which was released on February 4. The song was praised by music critics, who likened the classical phrases and choral vocals to Queen's \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" (1975)."@en ;

The song's lyrics tell of an androgynous \"frail but passionate creature\", referred to as \"he\" throughout, but called the feminine \"Belle\". (Androgyny was a prevalent theme in the music of Sheila E.'s mentor, Prince, and common in pop music of the period.)[citation needed] The song implies the Belle is French (viz. the lyrics, \"His Paris hair, it blows in the warm Parisian air / That blows whenever his Paris hair is there\") but St. Mark is commonly known as a location in Venice, Italy."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"This Is What Rock n' Roll Looks Like\" is the debut single of American industrial dance-pop singer-songwriter Porcelain Black, featuring American rapper Lil Wayne. This song serves as the lead single from the singer's debut studio album, Mannequin Factory. Produced by Moroccan-Swedish producer RedOne, who had originally discovered Black, \"This Is What Rock n' Roll Looks Like\" is influenced by the genre of rock, lyrically stating how the listener should be proud of who they are. The song was released digitally in the United States on March 29, 2011, and managed to chart at number forty-four on the US Billboard Hot Dance Club Songs. A music video for \"This Is What Rock n' Roll Looks Like\", shot and directed by Sanaa Hamri, was released on March 27, 2011. The music video pays homage to Porcelain Black's high school experiences, where she was constantly teased by \"snobby rich kids\", but never gave in to the pressure of her peers around her. The video serves as a form of revenge for Porcelain Black against high school tormentors. \"This Is What Rock n' Roll Looks Like\" garnered mixed reviews from critics, most of whom were shocked by Porcelain Black's image and sounds but favored her apparent perception of herself as the \"offspring\" of fellow musicians Britney Spears and Marilyn Manson and their individual styles. Porcelain Black performed the song on the Late Show with David Letterman, marking her debut televised appearance. The song was featured in an episode of Beavis and Butthead and the 2013 film, The Smurfs 2."@en ;

However, the song faced controversy when the rough version was leaked on the Internet on 31 May 2011. \"Chammak Challo\" was dubbed as the \"trademark of Ra.One's publicity campaign\". The song was named the most downloaded song and video of the year in India in a survey by wireless telephone major Airtel. It was rated as the best item number of 2011 in a Mid Day poll. The song also topped the MirchiTop 100 charts as the song of year. \"Chammak Challo\" also entered the Top 10 \"World Songs\" list of iTunes in eight countries, reaching No. 1 at three of them. Due to the extremely positive response for the song, Akon decided to branch out and make tracks especially for Bollywood projects and wanted to have a dedicated branch to produce music for Bollywood with local talent. Subsequently, Akon received a nomination for Best Playback Singer (male) at the 2012 Filmfare Awards. According to the insider report, Akon was paid 350K USD to sing this song."@en ;

Its production centers on the usage of synthesizers; the lyrics revolve around luring in a lover using spells and potions. It was released by Rinse and Columbia Records as the album's fifth and final single, on 28 August 2011. Upon its release, \"Witches' Brew\" generated mostly positive reviews from contemporary music journalists, who favored the melodic use of synthesizer arrangements. Commercially, it only entered two European charts, being that it reached number 128 on the UK Singles Chart. In doing so, it became the lowest peaking song from its parent album. In Flanders, its peak was higher, at number 22. The accompanying music video, directed by Colin Tilley, depicts Katy surrounded by winds, while in a room alongside a tied-up man."@en ;

He said: \"I guess I thought society as a whole is bombarded by advertisements and to me that's why the kids are sick again. It's a funny sounding phrase but it's a serious song - so it's a nice blend of being amused, but [also] I hope people sit up and take notice of it.\"Drummer Tom English added: \"They [the youth of today] can't express themselves anymore and this is for them.\" Smith told Drowned in Sound: \"The first line ('The comforting ache of the summer holiday') indicates that queasy feeling of adolescent isolation that I remember experiencing.

dbr:Get_Money	rdf:type	dbo:MusicalWork ;
	dbo:abstract	"\"Get Money\" is the third and final single released from the Junior M.A.F.I.A.'s debut album, Conspiracy. The original version, which heavily sampled Sylvia Striplin's \"You Can't Turn Me Away\", was produced by EZ Elpee with verses done by The Notorious B.I.G. and Lil' Kim. The official remix entitled \"Gettin' Money (The Get Money Remix)\" was produced by DJ Enuff, Lance 'Un' Rivera and The Notorious B.I.G. This version used a different instrumental, sampling Dennis Edwards' 1984 track, \"Don't Look Any Further\" featuring new verses by Lil' Kim and B.I.G. as well as a verse from Lil' Cease. \"Get Money\" became the group's biggest hit, peaking at 17 on the Billboard 100. It sold 500,000 copies domestically and was certified platinum by the RIAA. It ranked number 89 in Billboard's Top Hot 100 Hits of 1996. The song was used in the 2002 film 8 Mile and in the 2009 biographical movie Notorious (with Lil' Kim's verse.) The repeated line \"Take Money\" in the 2Pac song Hit 'Em Up is a play on \"Get Money\". The song is a very violent diss track aimed at Biggie Smalls and other members of the Bad Boy record label."@en ;

Not even the assistance of a mentor (played by producer Rick Rubin) can help them.

Prior to the release of Forever Becoming, an alternate version of \"Deny the Absolute\" was released in two formats on August 20, 2013. The first was a 7\" vinyl-only single released through The Mylene Sheath featuring the B-side \"The Truce,\" and the second was an iTunes-only compilation EP released through Southern Lord Recordings featuring tracks from Pelican's previous Southern Lord releases such as What We All Come to Need, Ephemeral and a music video for \"Lathe Biosas\" from Ataraxia/Taraxis directed by Diona Mavis. The alternate version of \"Deny the Absolute\" was generally well received by music critics. Kevin McFarland of The A.V. Club wrote that the song is, \"five and a half minutes of relentlessly thundering forward momentum\u2014assisted by some of the most delicate double-bass drumming you'll ever hear\u2014and yet more proof that pelicans are awesomely terrifying animals that should be feared by all.\" Jayson Greene of Pitchfork wrote that the song is, \"one of the most fevered churns they've managed in years, with maligned drummer Larry's hard, effective fills pushing the song forward like a thumb jabbed in your back. Like the best Pelican, it seems to form its own words as you listen.\" Gregory Adams of Exclaim! wrote that, \"While the track immediately steamrolls into an ecstatic post-metal clatter of drum bursts and detuned, interlocking melodies, a deft and damaging midsection locks into a murky, trilled-out groove.\""@en ;

It was written by Josh Alexander, Billy Steinberg and Toby Gad and produced by the former two along with Carl Falk, Steve Angello and Rami. The song was released on February 16, 2011, as the album's second single in the United Kingdom. \"Don't Hold Your Breath\" was critically acclaimed, with critics preferring it over singles by The Pussycat Dolls, as well as praising the empowering message and theme. The pop production was also praised. The song's lyrics speak of the female protagonist realising that her relationship with her man is over and she is not going to return to what used to be. A demo version of \"Don't Hold Your Breath\" with lead vocals from Timbaland and Keri Hilson leaked in 2010. Then in early January 2011, a second demo version with an altered production, different lyrics and uncredited female vocals also leaked. This was followed by a third unfinished version, this time with Scherzinger's vocals, before the final version premiered on January 14, 2011. An accompanying music video for \"Don't Hold Your Breath\" was directed by Rich Lee, and follows Scherzinger as she experiences the emotions of the song. Scenes include a hackney carriage journey, self-realisation, scornful glances in a mirror and wandering an old 1930s house. It was met with generally positive reviews from critics, who described it as one of Scherzinger's most personal music videos to date. Scherzinger performed \"Don't Hold Your Breath\" in a series of live appearances such as a performance on Let's Dance for Comic Relief and Good Morning America. The song has also achieved commercial success by topping charts in Poland and the United Kingdom, as well as reaching the top twenty in many other countries."@en ;

The lyrics to the track were supplied by The Who's main songwriter, Pete Townshend, and the music was by David Gilmour himself, the lyrics for the track were written within a day, after Gilmour had asked for Townshend's help. Townshend had also supplied the lyrics to another track from About Face, \"All Lovers are Deranged\". The single was only released in the UK, but sales were very poor, and the single was re-released in 1984 as a 7\" Picture Disc, but sales were still poor."@en ;

dbr:Loving_You_No_More	rdf:type	dbo:MusicalWork ;
	dbo:abstract	"\"Loving You No More\" is a song by American rapper and producer Diddy and his band Dirty Money, from their debut album, Last Train to Paris. It was written by Dawn Richard of the group, as well as Mario Winans and Canadian rapper Drake, the latter of whom featured on the song. Sean Garrett and his production group, Team S. Dot, receive writing and production credits, as does Miykal Snoddy. The song was released as the album's second single in the United States on September 21, 2010. According to Diddy, the song is about loving someone so much that you forget about yourself. It is a R&B tune, which integrates usage of electronica and hip-hop influences, while having a melodic, piano-laden background. The song's official remix features American rappers Gucci Mane and Red Cafe, while rapper and producer Jermaine Dupri also recorded a remix to the song. While critics were divided over Diddy's part in the track, most complimented the song's production, Drake's cameo, and Harper and Richard's vocals. \"Loving You No More\" peaked at ninety-one on the Billboard Hot 100 on two occasions. Meanwhile, it peaked in the top twenty of both the US R&B/Hip-Hop Songs and Hot Rap Songs charts. The song's Gil Green-directed accompanying music video shows Diddy, accompanied by Richard and Kalenna Harper, reminiscing on a past love in a mansion, and in a club scene with Drake. The group performed the song on BET's 106 & Park, during promotion of the album."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"I Don't Need You\" is a song written by Rick Christian and recorded by American country music artist Kenny Rogers. It was released in June 1981 as the lead single from Rogers album Share Your Love. The song was first recorded and released as a single in 1978 by Rick Christian himself (the song's writer) at Shoe Productions in Memphis, TN, but it failed to chart. Harry Nilsson recorded it in 1979 and released it on his Flash Harry album in 1980, but he did not release it as a single. Madeleine Marks also recorded it for her Self Titled album in early 1981, but did not release it as a single Kenny Rogers had collaborated with R&B/pop singer-songwriter Lionel Richie in 1980 with the song \"Lady\". After the success of that record, Rogers asked Richie to produce his next album, Share Your Love. Although the original plan was for Richie to write all the songs for Rogers' forthcoming album, the two men agreed to accept songs they both liked for the project which had been written by others. \"I Don't Need You\", written by Rick Christian, was one of those songs. Chosen as the lead single, \"I Don't Need You\" spent two weeks at number 3 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart in August 1981. The song also rose to number 1 on two other Billboard music charts, the country chart as well as the adult contemporary chart. It remained atop the latter chart for six weeks in July and August of that year. Rogers has been quoted describing \"I Don't Need You\" as \"...still to this day one of my favorite songs\", although he admitted that \"I don't think I ever met Rick Christian, the guy who wrote it.\""@en ;

dbr:Not_Fair	rdf:type	dbo:MusicalWork ;
	dbo:abstract	"\"Not Fair\" is a song by British recording artist Lily Allen from her second studio album, It's Not Me, It's You (2009). Written by Allen and produced by Greg Kurstin, the song was released as the second single from the album on 19 February 2009 by Regal Recordings. The song incorporates country music as the lyrics depict sexual frustration. Contemporary critics did not positively receive the song and its theme, some calling it a \"pseudo country track\" and considering it a strange musical composition. The single peaked in the top 20 of the charts of some European countries and Australia, while scoring Allen's second consecutive top-five hit on both the UK Singles Chart and the Dutch Top 40 (since in the latter \"Fuck You\" was a commercial success before \"Not Fair\"). The accompanying music video portrayed a western country theme, with Allen dancing next to a microphone, while backing singers are dressed as cowgirls, accompanied by cattle and farm birds. The video was shot the same day of the release of the single. It was performed live on different occasions, including Allen's 2009 concert tour. It was named at number 8 in the Triple J Hottest 100, 2009."@en ;

The title track was written and composed by singer-songwriter Yuka Kawamura and served as theme song for the TBS drama Hanawake no Yon-shimai, starring Mizuki herself. CDJournal described \"Hoshi no Hate\" as a \"ballad about marriage and family ties\" that is \"well-suited for the drama series it is used in.\" The B-side, \"Alisa in Wonderland,\" was produced by Micro from Def Tech and is also featured on SpeciAlisa. The CD+DVD edition of the single includes the music videos for both songs. \"Hoshi no Hate\" debuted and peaked at number 117 on the Oricon Weekly Singles chart and charted for only one week, selling 577 copies in total."@en ;

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/We\u0027re_on_the_Ball>	rdf:type	dbo:MusicalWork ;
	dbo:abstract	"\"We're on the Ball\" is a single by British pop duo Ant & Dec, released in 2002. Their second of three comeback performances since their musical career ended in 1997, and their only studio recording since, \"We're on the Ball\" is a football song. The song was adapted from a song written by Harold Spiro and was produced and arranged by Mike Hedges. The song is the England football team's \"Official Song\" of the 2002 FIFA World Cup. It features on the album The Official Album of the 2002 FIFA World Cup, released by Epic Records. The song's lyrics are about the England football team of the time, featuring references to their victory at the World Cup 1966 at their attempts to repeat that success since. It also namechecks the 2002 England football team by surname. The single was re-released digitally in May 2010 to coincide with the World Cup 2010. It was the duo's first single since their 1997 single \"Falling\", after which they decided to call time on their pop career and move into TV presenting. They resurrected their musical career for CD:UK in 2000 for a one-off performance of \"Let's Get Ready to Rhumble\". Their success with that performance lead to \"We're on the Ball\". The song entered the UK Singles chart at number 3, beaten by the debut singles from Will Young and Gareth Gates, who were the winner and runner-up of the reality show Pop Idol, which Ant & Dec presented. Thus, it became their highest peaking single at the time, beating 1994's \"Let's Get Ready to Rhumble\" which only at the time reached number 9. The music video starts with Ant & Dec eating in a caf\u00E9 watching the FIFA World Cup on a television (which is on top of a fridge that bears a sticker-advert for Tizer, who sponsored the music show CD:UK, which Ant & Dec also presented). Dec explains how they \"really want to be at the World Cup\", but Ant says \"it's too expensive\", and they would need to disguise themselves as then-England manager Sven-G\u00F6ran Eriksson and his assistant manager Tord Grip to be at the World Cup. After first laughing it off, the quickly deem it a good idea, they indeed disguise themselves in a K6 red telephone box outside the caf\u00E9 (a reference to Superman) and then go to the World Cup. The rest of the video sees them singing in the cafe and in disguise, as well as kicking large inflatable St. George's Flag footballs and, whilst in disguise, managing the England football team, wearing their fake identities on their shirts, which shows Dec's reluctance to be Grip. At the end of the video, the duo are caught by officials. A previous song with the same name was performed by The Balls Brothers in 1998. This had the same chorus and tune but different verses. Both songs are mainly accredited to the same person as songwriter Harold Spiro. Ant & Dec are also credited as songwriters on their version, writing all parts of the song bar the chorus."@en ;

dbr:Second_Hand_White_Baby_Grand	rdf:type	dbo:MusicalWork ;
	dbo:abstract	"\"Second Hand White Baby Grand\" is an original song introduced in the twelfth episode of the first season of the musical TV series \"Smash\", entitled \"Publicity\". The song was written by Marc Shaiman and Scott Wittman, but within the show's universe, it is written by songwriting team Julia Houston (Debra Messing) and Tom Levitt (Christian Borle) for their Marilyn Monroe musical Bombshell. In \"Publicity\", the song is written after newly appointed Marilyn, Rebecca Duvall (Uma Thurman), requests some script changes. The song is performed by Marilyn Monroe's \"shadow selves\", the voices that she hears inside her head (which are given much larger roles so the movie star but bad singer Rebecca Duvall doesn't have to sing as many songs). Although the song is originally meant for Karen Cartwright (Katherine McPhee), Ivy Lynn (Megan Hilty) plots against her by making Ellis (Jaime Cepero) send her an anonymous text, telling her that she is no longer needed in rehearsals, even though she is actually required to sing the song. With little time to waste, director and choreographer Derek Wills (Jack Davenport) gives the song to Ivy. The song is sung in the rehearsal room (the introduction being Monroe lying on a therapist's chair while the therapist is asking her to remember her mother), and as the chair is pushed aside, a movable plank of wood that Ivy is standing on is moved centre stage. The song \"bleeds over a montage of domestic activity featuring 'Smash' characters\". As soon as Ivy finishes the song, Duvall says that Marilyn (i.e. herself) should sing it. A reprise of the song is performed in the fourteenth episode \"Previews\" as the second last musical number of Bombshell (the last, until Don't Forget Me was written), and is performed by Duvall as Monroe as she lies on her bed, dying. The song (with Hilty's vocals) was initially released as a single from iTunes and Amazon.com's MP3 store and is currently available on the cast album Bombshell."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"He Touches Me\" is a song recorded by British singer Lisa Stansfield for her 2004 album, The Moment. It was written by Stansfield, her husband Ian Devaney and Richard Darbyshire from the 80s band Living in a Box, and produced by Trevor Horn. It is one out of four songs written by Stansfield for The Moment. For the very first time, the songs weren't produced by Devaney. The production was handled by Horn who worked with Seal, Tina Turner, Cher, Robbie Williams, Frankie Goes to Hollywood and many others successful singers and bands. The song received positive reviews from music critics who called it a fine mainstream track. On 29 November 2005 Stansfield received a Women's World Award in Leipzig, Germany and performed \"He Touches Me\" at the ceremony. Three days later, on 2 December 2005, Edel Records released \"He Touches Me\" on a CD single in Germany but the song failed to chart. The single featured radio and album versions of \"He Touches Me\" and two other tracks from The Moment, including \"Takes a Woman to Know\" (originally by No Angels). The latter track entered the Hungarian Airplay Chart in April 2005 and peaked at number thirty-three in May 2005."@en ;
