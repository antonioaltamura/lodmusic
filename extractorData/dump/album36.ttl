Elaborating on their previous full-length album, A Wintersunset... released a year before, with Songs of Moors... Empyrium delve into a more sophisticated intricacy of what is sometimes called \"romantic metal\", offering a complicated mix of percussion, flutes, bass guitars and synths, together with its will-be trademark deep baritone male vocals performed by Schwadorf himself (who also plays virtually all the instrument parties, except for keyboards). The album contains some of Empyrium's longest tracks (e.g. Track 3), presenting a more epic-like musical texture. By many the album is deemed as a true masterpiece of melancholic, dramatical metal. Songs of Moors and Misty Fields is the last doom metal album by Empyrium. Their following two albums, Where at Night the Wood Grouse Plays (1999) and Weiland (2002), are purely acoustic."@en ;

The series has inspired three soundtracks featuring music from the games. The soundtracks mainly consist of, often experimental, chiptune-based electronic dance music, encompassing electronic genres such as electro, house, techno, hardcore, jungle, ambient, breakbeat, gabber, noise, and trance. The music was produced using the Yamaha FM-synth sound chips of the Sega Mega Drive / Genesis video game console (YM2612) and NEC PC-88 computer (YM2608), along with Koshiro's own audio programming language \"Music Love,\" a modified version of the PC-88's Music Macro Language (MML). The soundtracks have been critically acclaimed. They are considered ahead of their time, and as some of the best video game music of all time. The soundtracks have influenced a range of chiptune, electronica, grime and dubstep musicians through to the present day, including artists such as Ikonika, BT, Labrinth, Martyn, Joker, Darkstar, Childish Gambino, and Danger. In September 2015 the Streets of Rage soundtrack was made available on 12\" vinyl record by DataDiscs."@en ;

Instead, it was released in selected territories where Universal thought it would do well. These included Mexico, South America, Germany, and some other European and Asian countries. The album went on to sell 3,000 copies in Brazil. The album sold relatively well in Latin America and some parts of Europe, where \"I Promised Myself\" was a huge hit. An American edition was planned for this album, and it was going to be released through Interscope Records in late 2004.

	dbo:abstract	"My Special Love is the second studio album by American singer La Toya Jackson. The album is one of Jackson's more successful, peaking at #175 on the Billboard 200 albums chart. After the album's limited success, it fell into obscurity, receiving a limited re-release on CD in Japan in the early 1990s, which was quickly deleted. This was the last Jackson album released with Polydor Records. Allmusic called it \"the defining album of Jackson's career\", also stating that \"Though her voice isn't particularly strong, Jackson makes up for what she lacks in power with an energetic, uninhibited approach to the music. Benefiting from solid R&B-funk arrangements and the well-rounded production of Ollie E. Brown, her second album is a flavorful mixture of lively uptempo romps and smooth-sailing slow jams.\" The first single from the album was \"Stay the Night\", a cover of the 1980 Billy Ocean single, and was moderately successful. The second and final single was \"I Don't Want You to Go\", which had a very small release and failed to chart. The album also includes \"Giving You Up\", a duet with brother Randy, and \"Camp Kuchi Kaiai\", which features background vocals by sister Janet. The album is the rarest album from LaToya, the other being Stop in the Name of Love (1995)."@en ;

dbr:Pocket_Revolution	rdf:type	schema:MusicAlbum ;
	dbo:abstract	"Pocket Revolution is the fourth album by Deus, released in 2005. The cover art is based on The Von Neumann-Machine, a story from Don Lawrence's Storm series of graphic novels. Pocket Revolution was the first Deus studio album to be released in six years, since The Ideal Crash in 1999. The band featuring Craig Ward and Danny Mommens disintegrated during its recording. Craig Ward who was supposed to produce the record left the band in August 2004, soon followed by Danny Mommens. They were replaced by ex- Evil Superstars Mauro Pawlowski and bass player Alan Gevaert who completed the recording of the album. So it actually makes two different bands playing on Pocket Revolution. Other contributions include Stef Kamil Carlens on backing vocals on Pocket Revolution and Sun Ra, CJ Bolland and Tim Vanhamel of Millionaire (who used to play guitar with Deus on The Ideal Crash tour). The release of the album was followed by a one year tour that led the band throughout Europe and to the United States, Canada, Israel and Thailand. It was the longest tour Deus ever did. Pocket Revolution became the best selling Deus record in Belgium, selling more than 50,000 copies - making it Platinum. The album sold about 200,000 copies worldwide. In December 2006, Pocket Revolution was re-released as Pocket Revolution Burnt. It contains a bonus cd with seven songs from the album remixed by Jagz Kooner, titled The Jagz Kooner Excursions. In February 2007, a Pocket Revolution songbook with lyrics and chords for all twelve songs of the album was released by Beriato Group. It is the first songbook to be dedicated to Deus."@en ;

This was due to the Reading Festival success the previous year, when they had stood in for heavy metal singer Ozzy Osbourne. Slade got exactly what they needed, and received a huge amount of notoriety from the concert. All of a sudden, as if overnight, they were now deemed 'cool'. Their record company didn't take long to jump on their success either, and released a sharp compilation Slade Smashes! which reached the #20 spot. As this album was released almost a month after their Reading appearance, there was little time to record new tracks, so some of the tracks were recycled from their failed Return to Base album of the previous year. The sleeve shows a Slade 'fist' bursting through a shield with four diagonal stripes on it. According to the band this is supposed to signify \"four royal bastards\", although in heraldic terms this is not strictly correct. The album was remastered in 2007 and included the remainder of tracks from Return to Base and 3 non-album bonus tracks. The album peaked at #473 for 1981 on rateyourmusic. Both tracks \"Dizzy Mamma\" and \"Nuts Bolts and Screws\" were especially remixed by the band at Portland Studios in London for this album.

By the time of the album's release, Slade's popularity was waning as were their record sales, which they acknowledged in the album's title. The glam rock movement, of which Slade were associated, had died, and the careers of other glam rock artists such as Mud, Gary Glitter and The Sweet had also died. In Britain, where Slade had traditionally been most popular, the fashion of the day was punk rock. With this album, Slade firmly stood its ground as a straight rock group, and gone were their \"glam\" statements of the early decade.[citation needed] The album was met with critical praise and support from the English punk uprising. Nevertheless, the record was a commercial failure and the band's financial woes continued. For many years, the album was a much sought-after collector's item amongst fans. However, the album is available today via CD remaster from 2007 and download. In later years, the album became a popular trade amongst American musicians developing what would be known as \"grunge\" as both Billy Corgan (Smashing Pumpkins) and Kurt Cobain (Nirvana) have cited the album as influential. The album was voted #1 of the top three Slade albums in the Slade Fan Club Poll of 1979. In the same poll, the album was voted #2 of the top three Slade album covers."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"1000 Fires is the debut studio album by American singer and actress Traci Lords, released on February 28, 1995, by Radioactive Records. The album remains her only full-length music release to date. Lords started working on the album in April 1994, and collaborated with producers Juno Reactor, Mike Edwards and Babble. Executive produced by Gary Kurfirst, 1000 Fires is predominantly influenced by electronic music with elements of techno, trance and trip hop. Lyrically, it mostly focuses on dark themes, referring to Lords' past in the porn industry, revealing her rape experience on the song \"Father's Field\" or dealing with thoughts of suicide on \"Fallen Angel\". Upon its release, the album received generally positive reviews from music critics. However, it achieved moderate commercial success because its sound was aimed more at the underground rave scene audience, and failed to enter the Billboard 200. It is currently out of print. During the promotion of the album, Lords performed as a DJ and opened shows for other artists such as Moby or the band My Life with the Thrill Kill Kult. Two singles from the album were released. The lead single, \"Control\", peaked at number two on the Billboard Hot Dance Club Songs and its instrumental version was featured in the film Mortal Kombat (1995). The soundtrack to the film was certified double platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), which earned Lords her first music award. Its following single, \"Fallen Angel\", was also successful in charts, peaking at number eleven on Hot Dance Club Songs. The Paul Oakenfold remix of the song was included on the soundtrack to the film Virtuosity (1995), in which Lords had a cameo appearance."@en ;

The album was met with both positive reviews by critics and popularity, especially in Argentina, Chile, Colombia and Mexico. The first single released from the album was \"Crimen\", which received airplay starting in April 2006 and gained huge popularity in Latin America and Spain. The second single, released in September was \"La Excepci\u00F3n\". The album was certified Platinum in Argentina with only pre-ordered sales, and attained Gold status in Mexico. On November 2, 2006, the album received the Latin Grammy for Best Rock Solo Vocal Album and \" Crimen\" won the category for Best Rock Song. The album was also nominated for Album of the Year, but lost to Shakira's Fijaci\u00F3n Oral Vol. 1. The third single released from the album was \"Adi\u00F3s\", which played on radio and TV stations in Latin America beginning in February 2007. In 2008, Cerati released two more singles from the album, \"Lago En El Cielo\", the fourth song on the album, and \"Me Quedo Aqu\u00ED,\" the fifth. Cerati toured Latin America, Spain and the USA to promote the album, and also performed for the very first time in London, playing at The Forum on October 12. The name \"Ah\u00ED Vamos\" (\"There We Go\") was a phrase repeated many times during the recording sessions, which came to be a war cry for Cerati during the time. On August 29, 2007, the album's second single \"La Excepci\u00F3n\" received two Latin Grammy nominations: Record of the Year and Best Rock Song, winning the later and beating Argentine band La Renga and Uruguayan band Cuarteto de nos, among others."@en ;

The two albums (or at least their material) were released together under the Are Me title in several \"deluxe\" release methods before Are Men received its own proper official release in February 2007. In this way, Are Me and Are Men together may be considered the band's seventh full-length original-material studio album. The album's artwork was created by Team Macho who also did similar artwork for the Are Me releases. The title is an extension of the Are Me title. During touring for the two albums, a pre-show video showed an unidentified hand adding various other extensions to the Barenaked Ladies Are Me title. The formal release of the album is an Enhanced CD, and contains software and individual tracks that allow the owner to remix three of the band's songs. An advanced release of the album, exclusive to Canadian Starbucks, was released on October 3, 2006. This version lacked the Enhanced CD feature, as well as final four tracks, which at the time were deemed \"bonus tracks\" for the Are Me release, both in its single-album form, and its 25-track deluxe form.

	dbo:abstract	"Bentley Rhythm Ace, released in 1997, was the debut album of Bentley Rhythm Ace, an electronic music duo from Birmingham, England. The name of the band derives from one of the first automatic drum machines, produced in the late 1970s. The album is best known for the single \"Bentleys Gonna Sort You Out!\" which featured in a few TV adverts at the time and was also praised in multiple music magazines such as NME upon its release. This song was also used as the soundtrack on several of the 100 Greatest\u2026 shows on the UK television's Channel 4. Most of the album epitomises the 'Big Beat' sound coming out of Brighton around that time, with heavy use of unusual beats and samples to create eccentric, but ultimately, dance-able electronic music. The album was released by Skint records, who also released Fatboy Slim's earlier work. Other than Big Beat, the album also explores Drum and Bass and Downtempo with similar eccentric stylings. The word 'carbootechnodisco' was coined (but never used by anyone else apart from them) for this album and refers to the band's pilfering of samples from various old vinyl records that they discovered and picked up at car-boot sales."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Best of Def Leppard (or The Best Of) is a compilation of some of Def Leppard's most popular songs. The album charted at No. 6 on the UK Albums Chart. Best Of supplements 1995's Vault as the definitive collection of Def Leppard's work. In fact, Best of Disc 1 is essentially Vault with the addition of \"Long Long Way To Go. A 2-CD limited edition was released in a slipcase with more obscure fan-favourite album cuts on the second disc, including tracks from more recent albums. In the UK, a cover of The Kinks' \"Waterloo Sunset\" was included as a bonus. This foreshadowed the band's forthcoming '70s cover album Yeah! Best Of was released in a number of territories around the world, but not North America. A 2-CD best of called Rock of Ages was issued there instead. The single-CD edition of the album features material from 1981's High 'n' Dry through to 2002's X. Track distribution focuses largely on the band's late '80s/early '90s hits, with a single song from High 'n' Dry, two from Pyromania (1983), six from Hysteria (1987), four from Adrenalize (1992), two from Retro Active (1993), and a single song from X. \"When Love & Hate Collide\", the sole new song from 1995's greatest hits set Vault was also included. The 2-CD version gives a more even cross-section of the band's career, starting with two songs from On Through the Night (1980), four from High 'n' Dry, seven from Pyromania, seven from Hysteria, five from Adrenalize, two from Retro Active, \"When Love & Hate Collide\" the new song on Vault, two from Slang (1996), one from Euphoria (1999), two from X (2002) and one new song, the cover of \"Waterloo Sunset\" which was to be included in the band's forthcoming cover album Yeah!

Christ Illusion includes the Grammy Award-winning songs \"Eyes of the Insane\" and \"Final Six\", and is the band's first studio album to feature original drummer Dave Lombardo since 1990's Seasons in the Abyss. It is also the first time since Divine Intervention that they recorded songs in D# tuning. The songs \"Jihad\", \"Flesh Storm\", \"Catalyst\" and \"Consfearacy\" were recorded in D# tuning, while the songs \"Catatonic\", \"Eyes of the Insane\", \"Skeleton Christ\" and \"Supremist\" were recorded in Drop B tuning. The remaining songs were recorded in C# tuning. Depicting a mutilated Christ painted by longtime collaborator Larry Carroll, the album's graphic artwork courted controversy. An alternative cover was issued to conservative retailers who felt uncomfortable with the original. The band also put out a censored cover which censored out the offensive artwork. Lyrics, particularly in the song \"Jihad\", describe the September 11 attacks from a terrorist perspective. A Mumbai-based Christian group, the Catholic Secular Forum, was outraged by this and thus demanded a recall. As a result, all Indian stocks of the album were recalled and destroyed by EMI India."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"I'm a Rebel is the second album by German heavy metal band Accept, recorded in 1979 and released in 1980 (see 1980 in music). It was the first of three consecutive Accept records to utilize Dirk Steffens as producer. The album finds Accept continuing to search for their musical direction, experimenting with a more commercial sound than on the debut. Bassist Peter Baltes once again sings lead vocals on two tracks, the slower-paced songs \"No Time to Lose\" and \"The King\". The title track is credited to George Alexander, which is a pseudonym for Alex Young, eldest brother of record producer and musician George Young and AC/DC guitarists Angus Young and Malcolm Young. Guitarist Wolf Hoffmann recalled the circumstances that led Alex Young to work with Accept: \"He got involved with Accept through the producer. Everybody after the first record said we have to have a radio hit. 'Guys you need a radio hit and we have just the song for you. Why don't you try this here?'\" The song became the basis for the band's first music video. Lead singer Udo Dirkschneider believes that the album \"wasn't too inspired. I think because of some unsuccessful experiments, the band wasn't too solid and the identity wasn't discovered yet.\" He also blamed \"too many people involved trying to manipulate the band, just like on the first album.\" Accept would become determined to resolve these deficiencies on their next album, Breaker. I'm a Rebel gained international distribution in the United Kingdom and United States on the Logo and Passport labels, respectively. These international versions both depict a sword hilt on the cover, a more identifiably \"heavy metal\" image than the original German cover. The Passport version simply titles the record Accept, as the band's 1979 self-titled debut had not been released in America."@en ;

Basic tracking for this, Marah's fifth studio release, began with departing band members Jon Wurster on drums and Mike \"Slo-Mo\" Brenner on dobro, bass, and electric guitar, and finished with new members Dave Petersen on drums and Adam Garbinski (both formerly of the band Squad Five-O) on electric guitar.

All the sounds on the album were collected and assembled or performed by Wally De Backer in bedrooms around Melbourne between 2003 and 2005, and the record was mixed and mastered by Fran\u00E7ois T\u00E9taz (Wolf Creek soundtrack, Machine Translations, Architecture in Helsinki). It was featured heavily by Triple J in May 2006 and nominated for a J Award, which, although it didn't win, lent the album considerable publicity. Two songs from Like Drawing Blood rated in the Triple J Hottest 100, 2006: \"Hearts a Mess\" at #8, and \"Learnalilgivinanlovin\" at #94. Like Drawing Blood also received the number 1 spot on the 2006 Triple J Album Poll for best album of the year, as voted by Triple J listeners. The album was also released in Belgium, in 2008, with three alterations: it contains a new version of \"Learnalilgivinanlovin\" with higher-pitched vocals in the chorus; the track \"Coming Back\" removes a sample in the intro and bridge; and the song \"A Distinctive Sound\" is replaced by a new version of \"The Only Thing I Know\" (the original appeared on Gotye's debut album Boardface). Three singles were released in Belgium: \"Learnalilgivinanlovin\", \"Hearts a Mess\", and \"Coming Back\". Like Drawing Blood has also received the number 11 spot on the 2011 Triple J Hottest 100 Australian Albums of All Time, as voted by the Triple J listeners."@en ;

Basia performed this song live on Late Night with David Letterman on Thanksgiving night on November 22, 1990. The album earned a platinum certification by the Recording Industry Association of America on August 11, 1992 for sales of over one million copies in the United States. It produced five singles: \"Baby You're Mine\", \"Cruising for Bruising\", \"Brave New Hope\", a cover version of \"Until You Come Back to Me (That's What I'm Gonna Do)\", and \"Copernicus\". \"Cruising for Bruising\" peaked at number 29 on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100, Basia's second U.S. Top 40 hit and third (and last to date) entry on the Hot 100. Three singles entered the U.S. Billboard Adult Contemporary chart, including \"Cruising for Bruising\" (which reached number five, tying with \"New Day for You\" from Basia's previous album, Time and Tide, as her most successful entry on that chart); \"Until You Come Back to Me\" and \"Baby You're Mine\" also charted AC though they failed to make the Hot 100.

	dbo:abstract	"Orblivion is the fourth studio album by The Orb released by Island Records. The Orb, reunited with Andy Hughes and Steve Hillage, returned to their spacy sounds typical of U.F.Orb. The album reached #19 on the UK Albums Chart and #174 on the Billboard 200. Though Orblivion was recorded in May 1996, it was not released until almost a year later, due to Island Records' desire to promote it as a follow up to U2's techno-rock album Pop. Orblivion sold very well in Europe as well as the United States, where it reached the Billboard Top 200. The first Orblivion single, \"Toxygene\", was the highest charting single by The Orb, reaching #4 in the UK on 8 February 1997. Despite high sales, Orblivion received a lukewarm reception from UK critics. Similarly to the case of Orbus Terrarum, Orblivion received better praise from American critics, including Rolling Stone who called it a \"scintillating contrast of chaos and euphony\". To support the album, The Orb embarked on the Organic Tour with Orbital, Meat Beat Manifesto, Underworld, Zion Train, and The Chemical Brothers. The Village Voice described The Orb as \"on its way down\" and the stresses of touring sat heavily on Paterson, but The Orb decided not to \"pack it in\" and instead continued touring and producing. The Orb then released the second Orblivion single, \"Asylum\". Orblivion features many samples, including \"72\" from which features a clip from Hair proclaiming \"the youth of America on LSD!\". The track \"S.A.L.T.\" is based on samples taken from Mike Leigh's film Naked, which features rantings from the main character's apocalyptic preaching."@en ;

dbr:Orbus_Terrarum	rdf:type	schema:MusicAlbum ;
	dbo:abstract	"Orbus Terrarum is the third studio album of electronic music artist The Orb released on Island Records in 1995. Before leaving The Orb, member Kris Weston had begun work on Orbus Terrarum. However, when he left The Orb, German producer Thomas Fehlmann joined as a full-time studio member. The Orb, now consisting of Alex Paterson, Andy Hughes, and Fehlmann, finished producing Orbus Terrarum. Unlike previous albums by The Orb, Orbus Terrarum featured more \"earthbound\" and \"organic\" sounds instead of the trippy science fiction themed music they had previously written. Orbus Terrarum suffered, as Paterson described it, \"a good kicking\" at the hands of the British press, who described it as \"generic ambient music\" and stated that it was a low point for Paterson's creativity. Orbus Terrarum further alienated many of the group's fans as they had with Pomme Fritz, causing the album to only reach No. 20 on the UK charts, much lower than their previous albums. American critics, however, gave it great acclaim, including Rolling Stone who made it their album of the month, citing the album's symphonic flow coupled with The Orb's \"uniquely British wit\". A quote from Tony Benn, Labour MP, graces the inner case of the 1995 release and the CD booklet of the 2008 re-issue. It says, \"There may be a legal obligation to obey, but there will be no moral obligation to obey. When it comes to history, it will be the people who broke the law for freedom that will be remembered and honoured.\" In 2008, Orbus Terrarum was remastered and released with a bonus remix disc. The package includes liner notes written by Kris Needs."@en ;

The album includes one cover, \"Hanging on the Telephone\", which was originally performed by The Nerves, although a cover of it by Blondie was more popular. \"The Good Life\" is also the name of a Weezer song, so some fans may have expected it to be a cover, especially since bassist Mikey Welsh was a member of Weezer prior to The Kickovers.

	dbo:abstract	"Slade Alive! is a live album by the British rock band Slade. The album was released on 24 March 1972, and reached number two on the UK Albums Chart, as well as being Slade's first album to dent the Billboard 200 in the United States. The album contained original songs, plus cover versions of songs by Ten Years After, The Lovin' Spoonful, Bobby Marchan, and Steppenwolf. The album was recorded live at Command Theatre Studio and mixed at Olympic Studios. In its original LP vinyl format, the album was issued in a gatefold sleeve which revealed a huge cartoon drawing on the inside. This drawing was the winning entry in a competition run in The Sun UK newspaper to design the album cover. In 2006 Salvo Records re-issued the tracks as part of the collection Slade Alive - the Live Anthology. Of the three nights recorded, most of the album consisted of the second night. The album was rated #2 of the top ten albums of 1972 by NME magazine's chart point survey. The album was voted #3 of the top three Slade albums in the Slade Fan Club Poll of 1979. In the same poll, the album was voted #1 of the top three Slade album covers. In the September\u2013December 1986 Slade fan club magazine, the poll results were announced for the 1986 opinion poll based on Slade\u2019s material. For the best album of the 70s, Slade Alive! placed at #1. In Australia, Slade Alive! was the biggest selling album since The Beatles' 1967 album Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. In Israel and Italy, the front cover used the inner gatefold artwork instead, whilst certain editions releases in the Netherlands and France also used this design. On the UK Granada Television, the band performed a 'Set of Six' show on 13 June 1972. This filmed set featured a similar set to the Slade Alive! album, the tracks in order being, Hear Me Calling, Look Wot You Dun, Darling Be Home Soon, Coz I Luv You, Get Down and Get With It and Born To Be Wild. On 6 February 2006, Classic Rock Legends released an independent critical guide to the album, under the title \"Slade Alive! - The Ultimate Critical Review\" as part of the series \"The World's Greatest Albums\"."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Somewhere Out in Space is an album by German power metal band, Gamma Ray. It was released on August 25, 1997 and is the band's fifth studio album. Continuing in the tradition of the previous four albums, it contained yet another different lineup, but would also be the first album to feature the band's longest standing lineup. The album featured Dirk Schl\u00E4chter on bass for the first time since his guest appearance on Heading for Tomorrow, Henjo Richter on guitar and Dan Zimmerman on drums. The track \"Watcher in the Sky\" was recorded by Iron Savior and appears on their self-titled 1997 album. It features Piet Sielck on guitar and additionalvocals, and Thomen Stauch on drums. The track \"No Stranger (Another Day In Life)\" was originally written as a contribution to Michael Kiskes solo album, but since Kiske rejected it as \"too heavy\" Hansen instead decided to record it with Gamma Ray. \"Miracle\" is effectively a stylized version of \"Man On a Mission\" from \"Land of the Free\", Gamma Ray's previous album. It has very similar lyrics, an identical chorus, and similar chord progressions, but at a slower tempo. The song \"Men, Martians and Machines\" begins with the \"five tones\" from the 1977 film Close Encounters Of The Third Kind played on strings."@en ;

The album includes four previously unreleased tracks: \"The Fallacy\", \"Linger\" (Piano version) (a different version of which appeared on the \"Quietus\" single), \"Crystal Mountain\" (orchestral version) (from the \"Quietus\" single) and \"Purushayita\" (a very different version of \"Vengeance is Mine\" from The Score \u2013 An Epic Journey album). The release of the album and book was announced on 16 January 2006 on the official website of Epica. The band stated that they wanted this album and book \"to be made for the fans, but also by the fans\". The album reached #46 on the Dutch album charts."@en ;

The album was presented as a covers/tribute album of country songs, as Ray Charles had done with his album Modern Sounds in Country and Western Music. However, over half of the selections on The Supremes Sing Country, Western & Pop were written in-house by Motown staffer Clarence Paul. One of the songs on the album is \"My Heart Can't Take It No More\", which the Supremes had recorded in 1962 and released in 1963 as a single. One of Paul's songwriting partners on the album was his fourteen-year-old charge Stevie Wonder, making the Supremes the first act besides Wonder himself to record Wonder's songs. Session group, the Andantes, appear on all but two of the tracks. They accompany Ross completely above Wilson and Ballard on Baby Doll.[citation needed] The album was a modest success peaking at #79 on the Billboard Top 200. It sold around 200,000 copies. Though the album did not make the Billboard Country Album charts, Diana would later record a couple of solo country singles most famously, \"Sorry Doesn't Always Make it Right\"."@en ;

Released by Aware Records in 2003, it was produced by Brendan O'Brien following songwriting sessions by the three members before they officially became a band. Aware reissued the album in late 2003 with a bonus disc of the band performing the entirety of the album acoustically. The Thorns was a group that consisted of Matthew Sweet, Pete Droge and Shawn Mullins. Both Matthew and Shawn became big names in Georgia, playing clubs in Athens and Atlanta. Sweet and Mullins even shared the same manager. It was through their manager that Sweet became involved in the Thorns. Recording took place at L.A.\u2019s Sound Factory studio. The band thought about calling themselves, \"Horn of Plenty\" before settling on the name, \"The Thorns\" after hearing Sweet play a composition of the same name. The band continued to record the album in Atlanta, with producer, Brendan O'Brien, who had previously worked with Sweet and Droge. The band wrote the album on a ranch in Santa Ynez, California. Sweet wrote five songs for the album, Mullins wrote two, and Droge had four. They also recorded a cover version of the Jayhawks song, \"Blue.\" During their premiere performance they dedicated the song to Jayhawk Gary Louris as he recovered from a recent life-threatening infection of the heart. Legendary drummer Jim Keltner played drums on the album. The group decided to stick with the name, \"The Thorns\" after Keltner introduced the group to the Rolling Stones as The Thorns."@en ;

As a visual artist and illustrator singer/guitarist Rick Froberg provided the album's artwork, while Reis released the album through his Swami Records label. It was the first Hot Snakes release to feature drummer Mario Rubalcaba, brought in to fill the position left vacant by original drummer Jason Kourkounis. In comparison to the band's previous albums, Audit in Progress is more aggressive and primal. It was well received by critics and fans and was named \"best punk album\" at the 2005 San Diego Music Awards. At this time the band was able to tour much more extensively than they had in support of previous albums, travelling the United States, Europe and Australia. An independent music video was filmed for the song \"Braintrust\" and a single for the song was planned for release in the UK market (which also would have included the unreleased song \"DNR\"), but when \"Braintrust\" was included on the band's Peel Sessions EP the following year the proposed single was cancelled. Audit in Progress would be Hot Snakes' final studio album, as the members decided to disband following a tour of Australia in Spring 2005 (though Thunder Down Under, a live-in-the-studio album recorded during this tour, would be released posthumously in 2006)."@en ;

ns32:_The_Dio_Years	rdf:type	schema:MusicAlbum ;
	dbo:abstract	"Black Sabbath: The Dio Years is a 2007 compilation CD of material from recordings made during vocalist Ronnie James Dio's tenure in the band. The CD contains full album length, remastered tracks culled from all three studio albums: Heaven and Hell (1980), Mob Rules (1981), Dehumanizer (1992), and the live album Live Evil (1982). It also contains three new recorded songs: \"The Devil Cried\", \"Shadow of the Wind\", and \"Ear in the Wall\". It was reported that the collection was first conceived of as a box set, in the vein of Black Box: The Complete Original Black Sabbath (1970\u20131978), containing all of the group's albums released from their post\u2013Ozzy Osbourne period, starting from Heaven and Hell to The Eternal Idol. This idea was eventually scrapped, and another box set was planned only to feature the four albums recorded from the Dio era of the band. This second idea was put aside, eventually emerging into The Rules of Hell box set released in the summer of 2008. In an interview conducted by Martin Popoff, Tony Iommi revealed that in fact three tracks were recorded: \"Shadow of the Wind\" (a slow tune), \"The Devil Cried\" (a mid-tempo rocker) and \"Ear in the Wall\" (a fast song), therefore changing the original plan for two new songs to accommodate all three tracks in the compilation. \"The Devil Cried\" was released as a single on 13 March 2007. On 23 February 2007, both Eddie Trunk and Sirius Satellite Radio unveiled the song \"The Devil Cried\" from the upcoming album. Rhino Records subsequently made the track available (for preview only) on 26 February 2007. On the week of 13 March 2007, it became available for download at all digital outlets. After the recording was completed the members decided to tour under the moniker Heaven & Hell. Dio and Iommi decided that the working partnership they had achieved in recording the 3 new songs would not be wasted, so they recorded The Devil You Know."@en ;

The album is a tribute to director Ted Demme, a close friend of Dulli's who died of a heart attack while playing a game of basketball in January 2002. Dulli had been working on another project entitled Amber Headlights (which would later see the light of day in 2005), but abandoned those sessions due to Demme's death. The recordings which followed, fueled in part by the memory of Demme, resulted in Blackberry Belle. The album was released on vinyl over two years after the initial CD release. Pressed on white vinyl, the LP contained an extra track \"Run, Rabbit Run\". This is a demo version featuring Greg Dulli on piano. He was known to perform a version of this song on the last The Afghan Whigs tour.

This album peaked at No. 40 on Billboard's album chart and sold 300,000 copies in the United States. That previous album, She Works Hard for the Money, had been her most successful since the disco era, and as a result, its producer Michael Omartian was asked to produce the new album as well. Again the majority of tracks were written by Summer and Omartian, though a couple of other writers were credited including Summer's husband Bruce Sudano. As with the previous album, Cats Without Claws was pop/dance oriented but included soulful ballads. The album also contained a cover of \"There Goes My Baby\", originally made popular by The Drifters, which became the first single. Although Summer requested \"Oh Billy Please\" as the first single, again Geffen and his executives rejected her request. A gospel song written by Reba Rambo-McGuire and Dony McGuire entitled \"Forgive Me\" would win Summer a Grammy award for Best Inspirational Performance. Cats Without Claws produced three singles: \"There Goes My Baby\", \"Supernatural Love\" (also released as a 12\" Single) and \"Eyes\", \"There Goes My Baby\" reached #21 on the pop chart.

The band played seven shows in ten days to tiny crowds in small bars and restaurants in the ski towns of Telluride and Aspen. Colorado '88 collects, in chronological order, the best of those shows, providing a vivid glimpse into the days before the three and four-night stands at amphitheaters and arenas that would distinguish Phish in the years to come. Mastered from the original analog cassette tapes, Colorado '88 contains recordings of songs that had not previously been widely traded or heard with such clarity.

dbr:Dead_City_Radio	rdf:type	schema:MusicAlbum ;
	dbo:abstract	"Dead City Radio is a musical album by Beat Generation author William S. Burroughs, which was released by Island Records in 1990. It was dedicated to Keith Haring. The CD is a collection of readings by Burroughs set to a broad range of musical compositions. It was produced by Hal Willner and Nelson Lyon, with musical accompaniment from John Cale, Donald Fagen, Lenny Pickett, Chris Stein, and alternative rock band Sonic Youth, among others. Although not Burroughs' first album\u2014he released his first spoken word album Call Me Burroughs in the 1960s and was a fixture on the Giorno Poetry Systems collections of the 1970s and 1980s\u2014this was the first release to receive wide public attention. Most of the recordings of Burroughs readings were made at his home in Lawrence, Kansas between December 12 and 15 1988, with further recordings taking place on June 24, 1989. The music was added at a later date. During these sessions Burroughs was captured singing the German standard \"Ich bin von Kopf bis Fu\u00DF auf Liebe eingestellt\" (Falling in Love Again), a song associated with Marlene Dietrich. This recording was included as a bonus track and is the only commercially available track as of 2012 to depict the author actually singing. The material performed by Burroughs on the album included excerpts from some of his famous works such as Naked Lunch, as well as a couple of items from his 1989 short story collection Tornado Alley. The track \"Kill the Badger!\" is an excerpt from Burroughs' novella The Cat Inside. A music video was created Burroughs' reading of \"A Thanksgiving Prayer\" (a poem from Tornado Alley); the reading (like the book from which it came) is dedicated to John Dillinger. Burroughs prefaces his reading of the short story \"Where He Was Going\" with a brief discussion of its inspiration and origins. The brief narrative \"Brion Gysin's All-Purpose Bedtime Story\" is taken from Ghost of Chance, a novella Burroughs would publish in 1991. Several tracks include Burroughs discussing elements of Christianity and The Bible in a conversational style, and one track has Burroughs reciting the Sermon on the Mount while adding editorial comment. The track \"Ah Pook the Destroyer\" was later used as the soundtrack for the acclaimed animated short film Ah Pook Is Here. Burroughs' song \"Falling in Love Again\" plays over the closing credits of the film."@en ;

EV3 was the last album recorded with Dawn Robinson who decided to leave the group for a solo career. Her abrupt departure from En Vogue forced the remaining trio to re-record several of Dawn's original lead vocals; however, not every track was re-recorded, with Dawn's leads remaining intact on several tracks and her background vocals still appearing on every song with the exception of \"Does Anybody Hear Me\". EV3 spawned two hit singles. The first, \"Whatever\", reached gold status in the US. The second one, the ballad \"Too Gone, Too Long\" was less successful. The giant hit \"Don't Let Go (Love)\" was also included as a key track on EV3. \"Let It Flow\" was a contender to be a final single. Plans for a single release never materialized, but it did appear the following year on the Greatest Hits compilation Best of En Vogue.

It reached the top ten of the country album charts before it was issued officially (due to imports from both the United States and Ireland). Critics felt that this would ruin the album's sales once it was issued. However, when it was eventually issued in Britain in early 1994 it went to #1 on the country charts and reached #2 in the pop charts and also produced two top 40 hit singles on the British pop charts. The track \"Callin' Baton Rouge\" was previously a #37 peaking single in 1987 for the New Grass Revival, whose members back Brooks on his rendition. It was the first time the group had recorded together since they disbanded in 1989. In an interview with BBC Radio DJ Richard Wooton, Brooks stated that the track \"The Cowboy Song\" (which was composed in 1987 by Roy Robinson) was found in a trash can by someone on his team who liked the song and played the track to him."@en ;

The DVD contains a 2002 documentary outlining the career of Bj\u00F6rk, from her early work in Icelandic bands, to joining The Sugarcubes to her solo work up to 2002. The documentary gives viewers a personal view into her private thoughts, views and motivations. Inside Bj\u00F6rk also features interviews with Sean Penn, Lars von Trier, Thom Yorke, Beck, RZA, Elton John, Missy Elliott, the late Alexander McQueen and more on their thoughts of Bj\u00F6rk and her impact on music and culture. The documentary coincided with the release of the Greatest Hits album, and had previously been seen on some television networks at the end of 2002. It was commissioned by One Little Indian to make up for the fact that Bj\u00F6rk was beginning to do fewer interviews than had been previous. Two small new live performances are included in the documentary, \"Generous Palmstroke\" performed with Zeena Parkins and an organ version of \"The Anchor Song\" played in an Icelandic church."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Madstock! is a live album by ska/pop band Madness, released on 2 November 1992 (see 1992 in music). The album includes highlights from Madness' first concerts since their disbanding in 1986, on 8 and 9 August 1992 at Finsbury Park in London. The bill included Flowered Up, Gallon Drunk, Ian Dury and The Blockheads, Morrissey and Madness. At the Saturday show, Morrissey wrapped himself in a Union Jack flag, attracting a group of right-wing types to gather close to the stage. This controversy ended up garnering more attention than the re-union of Madness. The full concert was released on a corresponding video, but both the album and video are now out of print, But is available in the box-set A Guided Tour Of Madness as a DVD. The concert became a biennial event being held again in 1994, 1996, and 1998 (this last Madstock is available on DVD). In December 2008 the band announced that they would be staging a 5th Madstock concert in 2009 to celebrate their 30th anniversary held on 17 July in Victoria Park, East London. The album reached #22 in the UK album charts. \"The Harder They Come\", a cover of the Jimmy Cliff song, was released as the only single off this album and reached #44 in the UK charts."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Rhythm and Stealth is the second album by Leftfield released on 20 September 1999. It was the follow-up to 1995's Leftism. The album reached No. 1 in the UK album chart. It was nominated for the Mercury Music Prize in 2000 but lost out to Badly Drawn Boy's The Hour of Bewilderbeast. Rhythm and Stealth had a notably harsher underlying beat than its predecessor with songs such as \"Phat Planet\" and \"Afrika Shox\" being much darker than those on the previous album. The album is best known amongst the public for the song \"Phat Planet\", which was featured in Guinness' 1999 advert Surfer and the animated series Beast Machines, although the song was never released as a single. The best selling single from the album was \"Afrika Shox\" featuring Afrika Bambaataa which peaked at No. 7 in the UK Singles Chart. The album was released on CD, cassette, double-LP, quintuple 10\" box set and MiniDisc (COLUMBIA 488527 8). \"Double Flash\" was one of the songs that was remixed into the European release of MTV Music Generator, known as Music 2000. The album was re-released on 29 May 2000 with a bonus disk of remixed versions which was also released as an album on its own, Stealth Remixes. The song \"Swords\" was featured in the 1999 film Go."@en ;

The Gospel According To Patti LaBelle features collaborations with Yolanda Adams, Mary Mary, Kanye West, Wynonna Judd, The Soul Seekers, Tye Tribbett, CeCe Winans and more. Production duties were handled by Gordon Chambers (who produced Patti's hit duet with Ron Isley, \"Gotta Go Solo\"), J. Moss, Scott \"Shavoni\" Parker, Troy Taylor, Gerald Haddon, Jon DeLise (also produced on Patti's Timeless Journey's Two Steps Away) and others. The Gospel According To Patti LaBelle debuted on the U.S. Billboard 200 at number 86, selling about 18,000 copies in its first week. The album peaked at #17 on Billboard's Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart, and #1 on Billboard's Top Gospel Albums chart for 17 weeks. \"Where Love Begins,\" a duet with Yolanda Adams was played frequently on R&B and gospel radio stations and debuted at #68 on Billboard's Hot R&B/Hip-Hop tracks. The second single \"Anything\" featuring Kanye West, Mary Mary and Consequence hit #64 on Billboards Hot R&B/Hip-Hop tracks."@en ;

The album was released on 19 October 2007 for Europe and on 23 October 2007 for the US, both through Nuclear Blast. Everything aside from vocals was recorded at Not Quite Studios in Helsingborg. This is the only album to include Daniel Antonsson on guitar who replaced founding member Peter Wichers after his late 2005 departure. It is also the last album to feature long-time guitarist Ola Frenning who left Soilwork in February 2008. Sworn to a Great Divide was Soilwork's biggest commercial success at the time of its release, selling approximately 5,000 copies in its first week in the U.S., charting at No. 148, and reaching No. 2 on the Top Heatseekers. The album in its entirety was put on Soilwork's MySpace on 10 October 2007. Due to other commitments, Devin Townsend only produced the vocal tracks. The remaining production duties were in the hands of Ola Frenning and Peter Wildoer. While speculation led many fans to believe this would be a sequel to the intense Natural Born Chaos, Sworn to a Great Divide instead continued the band's more commercial progression, further deviating from the bands melodic death metal roots.[citation needed]"@en ;

It was slated to be the next Deadboy and the Elephantmen album before that band's dissolution. Riggs decided to release it under his own name, on August 21, 2007. Matt Sweeney provided a combination of guitar, bass, piano and backing vocals for all of the tracks, as well as producing the record. We Sing of Only Blood or Love is dominated by dark neo-blues rock songwriting structures, and also contains heavy metal, folk music, gothic rock, protopunk, and some experimental material. The album is a continuation of Riggs' musical evolution since fronting the Louisiana sludge metal band Acid Bath in the 1990s. Riggs uses a trained, rich vocal style most frequently sung in a blues-influenced baritone rasp. His lyrics contain various stylistic elements of metaphor and imagery, and touch upon personal and poetic subjects such as death, love, Satan, nocturnal hallucinations, mortality, phantoms, and morbidity."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back is the second studio album by American hip hop group Public Enemy, released on June 28, 1988 by Def Jam Recordings. Public Enemy set out to make the hip hop equivalent to Marvin Gaye's What's Going On, an album noted for its strong social commentary. Recording sessions took place during 1987 at Chung King Studios, Greene St. Recording, and Sabella Studios in New York City. Noting the enthusiastic response toward their live shows, Public Enemy intended with Nation of Millions to make the music of a faster tempo than the previous album for performance purposes. The album charted for 49 weeks on the US Billboard 200, peaking at number 42. By August 1989, it was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America, for shipments of one million copies in the United States. The album was very well received by music critics, who hailed it for its production techniques and the socially and politically charged lyricism of lead MC Chuck D. It also appeared on many publications' year-end top album lists for 1988, and was the runaway choice as the best album of 1988 in The Village Voice's Pazz & Jop critics' poll, a poll of the leading music critics in the US. Since its initial reception, It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back has been regarded by music writers and publications as one of the greatest and most influential albums of all time. In 2003, the album was ranked number 48 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time, the highest ranking of all the hip hop albums on the list, and the only one acknowledged in the top hundred."@en ;

After the release of their self-titled debut album, Crvena Jabuka was supposed to go on a concert on 18 September 1986. The concert never happened since two members of the band were involved in a serious car crash near Jablanica that claimed the life of guitarist and vocalist Dra\u017Een Ri\u010Dl at the scene, as well as bass player Aljo\u0161a Buha (who died in a hospital nearly two weeks later from the injuries.)

	dbo:abstract	"Greatest Hits ... And More is the name of a 2006 compilation of songs by English pop group 10cc as well as pre-10cc and post-10cc work by its founding members, Graham Gouldman, Eric Stewart and Kevin Godley and Lol Creme, performing as Godley & Creme. The album was released as a double CD. The album attracted criticism both from fans who complained about one track, \"Feel the Benefit\", running at a slow speed and from Eric Stewart, who noted his post-10cc work had been overlooked, while a disproportionate number of tracks representing Gouldman's career before and after 10cc had been included. Stewart commented: \"Some fans seem to think that I may have vetoed the use of my own songs on the album, especially as Kevin and Graham have two new songs on there, but this definitely isn't the case. Lol and I were simply not consulted by Universal about the content of the release and didn't know anything until the advertising appeared. It does appear that the compilation has been hijacked, the number of Gouldman songs being completely disproportionate. Why no Frabjoy and the Runcible Spoon etc etc? Anyone initially reading the track list could be forgiven for thinking that it should really have been called \"A History of Graham Gouldman's Musical Associations\"!\" Stewart reproduced correspondence from Universal Music which indicated Harvey Lisberg, the former 10cc manager and long-time Gouldman manager, had had a significant role in the album's track selection and added: \"I am very shocked and sad that this has happened, but again, like the recent tours, you will have to make up your own minds whether this album represents a real 10cc compilation or not.\""@en ;

Produced by Jerry Harrison, I'd Rather Eat Glass is an alternative pop rock album with post-grunge, folk and trip hop elements. Phillips collaborated with a number of artists when writing songs for the album, including Eric Bazilian, Greg Wells, Dave Bassett, Howard Jones and Jill Cunniff. Upon its release, I'd Rather Eat Glass received mixed reviews from music critics, mostly criticising the work for being immature. Her musical style has been compared to Natalie Imbruglia or Kay Hanley of Letters to Cleo. \"When I Hated Him (Don't Tell Me)\" was released as the lead single from the album. Directed by Lori Hoeft, the music video was shot in a trailer park where Phillips portrays a stripper who caught her boyfriend cheating on her. \"Hawaii\" was released as a promotional single.

	dbo:abstract	"I've Got My Own Album to Do is the first solo album by English musician Ronnie Wood, released in September 1974. An all-star project recorded outside of his activities with the Faces, it reached number 27 on the UK's New Musical Express chart. The title was a dig at Rod Stewart, who appeared to be more committed to his solo career than to working with the Faces. Wood has said that the album title originated from contributors such as George Harrison and Mick Jagger \"nagging me to let them go home\" and finish their own projects. The album was recorded at The Wick, Wood's house in Richmond, south-west London. During this period, Wood assisted Jagger in writing and recording the Rolling Stones' 1974 single \"It's Only Rock 'n Roll\", while Jagger reciprocated by helping Wood with this album's opening track, \"I Can Feel the Fire\". Keith Richards was another participant at the sessions, in addition to performing concerts in London with Wood to promote the release. Wood's collaboration with Harrison, \"Far East Man\", was re-recorded by Harrison and appeared on the former Beatle's Dark Horse album three months after the release of I've Got My Own Album to Do. Other musicians on the record include Stewart, fellow Faces Ian McLagan and Kenney Jones, Mick Taylor of the Rolling Stones, and the all-American rhythm section of Willie Weeks and Andy Newmark. The Faces worked \"I Can Feel the Fire\" and \"Take a Look at the Guy\" into their setlists for a 1974 UK tour and two US tours of 1975. Wood performed \"I Can Feel the Fire\", \"Far East Man\", \"Mystifies Me\" and \"Am I Grooving You\" in his solo shows between 1979 and 2012."@en ;

It notably features a disco-inspired sound on most of its songs as opposed to the alternative rock sound of earlier albums. This was because the band decided they needed a big change to their sound after ten years. Lead singer Jacqueline Govaert decided to base this new sound on bands such as Blondie and The Sounds; in fact, members Jesper Anderberg and Felix Rodriguez of The Sounds co-wrote some of the album's tracks. A special edition of the album was released on February 29, 2008."@en ;

This new line up consisted of legendary bassist Kenny Aaronson and lead guitarist Tony \"Bruno\" Rey. Pure and Simple would be the last Joan Jett & the Blackhearts release until 2006's Sinner. In 1995, both Aaronson and Rey went on to other projects. Aaronson would eventually become a member of the reunited New York Dolls \u2013 coincidentally taking over for bassist Sami Yaffa, his replacement in the Blackhearts and Rey became the musical director for Enrique Iglesias and pop sensation Rihanna. \"Hostility\" and \"World of Denial\" are added on the Japanese pressings. The Japanese cover differs from regular cover. \"Get Off the Cross\" was also recorded during these sessions. Concurrently released in the US on vinyl LP, CD, and cassette, all versions varying slightly. The record album came with a hype sticker that read \"All Rock. No Ballads\" and features the track \"Here to Stay\" co-written by Jett and Kat Bjelland. A few seconds of the song are also heard on the cassette at the very end of Side One before fading out. Jett independently put out \"Spinster\" as a 7-inch blue vinyl single in the US with a picture sleeve. The B-sides were \"Go Home\" and \"Hostility\".

Whispering Jack has become the highest selling album in Australia; as of 2006, it was 24x platinum indicating sales of over 1.68 million copies sold. It spent 25 weeks at the No. 1 spot on the Album Charts during 1986\u20131987, it was awarded the 1987 ARIA Award for \"Album of the Year\", and was the best charting album for the decade of the 1980s in Australia. It was the first Australian-made album to be released on Compact Disc within Australia. One of Farnham's biggest hits, \"You're the Voice\" was issued as the lead single from this album and peaked at No. 1 on the Kent Music Report Singles Charts. Prior to this album, Farnham's career had stalled after being recruited and then leaving as lead singer of Australia's Little River Band. Farnham's manager, Glenn Wheatley, mortgaged his home to raise funds for the recording of this album. After initial reluctance by major Australian radio stations to play the lead single, \"You're the Voice\", public demand became overwhelming and they relented. The song became one of the standout Number One songs on the Australian Charts of the 1980s and still remains a staple of Australian Radio. Whispering Jack restarted Farnham's career and kept it rolling across two more decades. On 21 November 2006, Whispering Jack was re-released to celebrate its 20th Anniversary, which came with a bonus track, an extended studio version of \"Pressure Down\" and with a DVD of the edited 1987 Whispering Jack Live in Concert televised performance."@en ;

This is Nastasia's fifth studio release overall. Jim White is arguably known best as the drummer for Australian rock trio The Dirty Three, but he had long been closely associated with innumerable other alternative rock acts, often spending years at a time recording and/or touring extensively with the likes of Bonnie Prince Billy, Cat Power, Bill Callahan / Smog, PJ Harvey and Nick Cave, among others; yet this is the only album to bear his name as a leading artist. A non-album single, \"What She Doesn't Know,\" was released in both 7\" vinyl and digital download formats on 25 February 2008 in support of the album."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Beauty & the Streets Vol. 1 is a mixtape by American recording artist M\u00FDa. It is her first mixtape to be released by Young Empire Music Group with distribution from Fontana Distribution on September 29, 2009. The project came to surface when Harrison felt as though she had abandoned her U.S. fan base and wanted to release music for them. The mixtape served as Harrison's second independently released project on her own label imprint Planet 9 and was created to serve the \"clubs, strip clubs, whips, and bedroom\" with a predominantly southern sound. Production on Beauty & the Streets Vol. 1 was primarily handled by in-house producers selected by Harrison; Young Yonny, The Bama Boyz, T-Minus, Arkatech Beatz and a host of others. Just as she did previously with her fifth studio album Sugar & Spice (2008), Harrison lent a hand in the songwriting process, co-writing several of the mixtape's tracks with many different artists and songwriters and served as executive producer to the project. Guest features included a then unknown Nicki Minaj, Houston native rappers Bun B, Chamillionaire, Trae, Slim Thug and Z-Ro and Atlanta rapper Shawty Lo. Beauty & the Streets Vol. 1 spawned two promotional singles; the Bun B-assisted \"Show Me Somethin'\" and the T-Minus-produced track \"Black Out\". Although both singles were released to iTunes, neither single was serviced to radio. Beauty & the Streets Vol. 1 debuted at number fifty-five on the Billboard Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart on October 17, 2009."@en ;

Most of the songs were recorded between 2004 and 2006 and were released as series of ad hoc EPs which were sold at shows by the band. The band came to the attention of Killer Pimp owner Jon Whitney in late 2006 and he asked if he could have the songs remastered and release them as an album on CD. The band deliberated over whether this would be a good move for some time before finally agreeing. The album was released in a limited edition in August 2007. This soon sold out and several repressings were made. As of March 2008 further pressings are ongoing. The album was also released on vinyl by Important Records as a limited edition of 1,000 copies with 300 on clear vinyl and 700 on black. These sold out and a second edition of 1,000 with 300 on red/white splatter was pressed. A third pressing of 1,000 was made with the first 300 on white in July 2008. \"To Fix The Gash In Your Head\" appears on the Nine Inch Nails online release Lights In The Sky, which contains music from the opening acts (including A Place To Bury Strangers) of some concerts of that tour."@en ;

After the album had been leaked on the internet, it became available on iTunes on August 19, 2008, while physical copies saw a release date of October 27, 2008. In the U.S. the album was released on Kranky and on 4AD in Europe. The album was recorded over the course of one week in April 2008 by Nicholas Vernhes at Rare Book Room Studios in Brooklyn, NY. In the U.S., the album has managed to sell over 50,000 units. Unlike Cryptograms, the band decided to forgo heavy utilization of effects pedals. Throughout the recording of the record, only a number of drum tracks and the vocals on \"Agoraphobia\" were treated. Of the musical direction of the new material, Bradford Cox has said \"I'm more interested in the micro-structure. I want things to be a lot shorter, I don't want there to be as much long-windedness to it.\" The band premiered the album live at Brooklyn's Market Hotel on April 11, 2008. A bonus disc, Weird Era Cont., was released concurrently with the album. \"Saved By Old Times\" features an appearance by Cole Alexander of the Black Lips. His appearance was recorded over an iChat session."@en ;

Often, Karate was sent live material from their own performances, usually from sound technicians.

Karate was so astonished by the quality of the recording they decided to release this 'posthumous' live album. The two longest tracks on the album feature lengthy solos from guitarist Geoff Farina.

Tenement Symphony includes three UK Top 40 hit singles; \"Jacky\", \"My Hand Over My Heart\" and \"The Days of Pearly Spencer\" (which would become Almond's last UK Top 10 hit). Working with former La Magia and Willing Sinners member Billy McGee, and his former Soft Cell bandmate David Ball as well as various studio musicians, Almond recorded the album at Maison Rouge, Sarm West Studios, Fishermans Room, Berlin, CTS Studios, Berwick St Studios, RAK, Pacific Studios. The album is divided into two sections; 'Grit' and 'Glitter'. The first five songs constituted the 'Grit' and were produced by Almond, Billy McGee, Nigel Hine, and The Grid. The 'Glitter' side (the Tenement Symphony) was produced by Trevor Horn. The artwork was designed by Green Ink with a cover photograph by Klanger and Boink. The album cover mimics the style of German record label Deutsche Grammophon's classical records. Almond wrote in his autobiography that the album's concept was largely down to Rob Dickins and that he did not feel the album truly reflected his artistic direction at that time, though he was pleased to have had the opportunity to work with Trevor Horn."@en ;

Annie began recording music in 1999 with her boyfriend, Tore Kroknes, who died in 2001. She returned to recording later that year, collaborating with Richard X, R\u00F6yksopp, and Timo Kaukolampi. The album combines Annie's thin, airy vocals with heavily layered beats. It is heavily influenced by 1980s dance-pop. Upon release, the album was successful in Norway. Blogs leaked tracks from Anniemal before it was released internationally, and publications from other countries soon praised the album for its blissful but melancholic sound. Before releasing the album internationally in 2005, Annie's record label 679 Recordings was not confident in the album's ability to achieve commercial success overseas, so it did not heavily promote Anniemal. The album eventually sold over 100,000 copies worldwide. It yielded four singles: \"Chewing Gum\", \"Heartbeat\", \"Happy Without You\", and \"Always Too Late\"."@en ;

dbr:Best_of_Bowie	rdf:type	schema:MusicAlbum ;
	dbo:abstract	"Best of Bowie is a career-spanning greatest hits album by English recording artist David Bowie. It was released on 22 October 2002. The songs range from his second self-titled album (1969) to Heathen (2002). It was released 35 years after his debut album, David Bowie. In each of the 21 territories that the album was released, it was given its own track listing, based upon which songs were most popular locally. In a number of countries, there were two versions \u2013 a single-disc version, and a double-disc version. All in all 63 tracks appear in at least one of the 20 different versions. The country the edition came from can be identified by a small national flag on the spine, except for the Argentine/Mexican, Eastern European and UK editions, which are \"flag-less\". All the tracks are digitally remastered either from 1999 or, for the single edits, 2002, with the exception of \"Under Pressure\", which is also at a lower volume than the rest of the disc. A DVD version of the compilation was also released, containing 47 videos and live performances as well as alternate versions and easter eggs. Some of the videos on this collection, notably \"China Girl\", \"Loving the Alien\" and \"Day-In Day-Out\" are the censored versions of the original videos. Initially peaking at number 11 in October 2002 on the United Kingdom's Official Charts, the album entered the top 10 for the first time in January 2016, following Bowie's death, and reached a new peak of number 1. It also became the first album to reach number 1 on the Official Charts due to streaming."@en ;

It does not contain any examples of the relaxed tempo songs Dire Straits had been known for. It is the first release to feature drummer Terry Williams, who filled the spot after drummer Pick Withers left the group in August 1982.

The musical style of Hooray for Boobies is grounded in the alternative rock, rapcore, and electronica genres, with prominent rap-metal guitar riffs, samples, electronic instruments, and lyrics rife with toilet humor. The album received generally favorable reviews and was a commercial success. Hooray for Boobies effectively broke the Bloodhound Gang into the mainstream.

	dbo:abstract	"Suit is the fourth studio album by American rapper Nelly. It was intended to be released on August 17, 2004, before being delayed and released on September 13, 2004, by Universal Records. Production for the album was handled by several producers, including The Neptunes, Jazze Pha, Doe, AHM, Jayson \"Koko\" Bridges, Kuya Productions, Soulshock and Karlin, Ryan Bowser, Big Boi and Beat Bullies. Released in conjunction with Sweat, Nelly intended to release a single album before conceptualizing and releasing two albums simultaneously, both of which would contrast each other's themes. Nelly characterized Sweat as \"more up-tempo\" and \"energetic\" while describing Suit as more of \"a grown-up and sexy vibe [...] it's more melodic\". The album produced three singles: \"My Place\", \"Over and Over\" and \"'N' Dey Say\". Its lead single, \"My Place\", was a commercial success, topping the New Zealand, Australian and UK single charts, becoming Nelly's second number one on the former and latter charts. It peaked at number four on the US Billboard Hot 100. \"Over and Over\" featuring country singer Tim McGraw was also a success, peaking at number three on the Hot 100, and topping several charts worldwide, including the Irish, Australian and UK Singles Charts. \"My Place\" and \"Over and Over\" were certified gold and platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), for shipments of 500,000 and one million copies, respectively. Suit's final single, \"'N' Dey Say\", achieved moderate chart success, peaking at number sixty-four on the Hot 100 and number six on the UK Singles Chart. Suit was generally well received by music critics, who compared it with Sweat, praising both album's contrasting themes and musical content, though with some criticism also targeted towards their content, in regards to inconsistencies. Suit topped the US Billboard 200 chart in its opening week, selling 396,000 copies, becoming Nelly's third consecutive US number-one album. It went on to be certified three times platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), for shipments of three million copies. The album was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Rap Album at the 47th Grammy Awards, losing to Kanye West's The College Dropout."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Body Language is the ninth studio album by Australian singer Kylie Minogue, released on 10 November 2003 by Parlophone. Following the massive commercial success of her eighth studio album Fever (2001), Minogue enlisted a diverse group of writers and producers to aid in creating a new album, including Cathy Dennis, Dan Carey, Emiliana Torrini, Johnny Douglas and Mantronix among others. Influenced by the musical works of the 1980s and artists like Prince and Scritti Politti, Body Language musically differs from Minogue's previous albums, which mainly featured disco-oriented dance-pop tracks, and instead explores genres like synthpop, electroclash, R&B, and hip hop. Many tracks in Body Language contain references to songs from the 1980s and lyrically, the album touches upon themes of enjoyment, flirting, and sex. Three singles were released from Body Language. \"Slow\" was released as the lead single in November 2003 and was a commercial success, peaking at number one on the singles charts of Australia, Denmark, Spain and the United Kingdom. \"Red Blooded Woman\" was released as the second single in March 2004 and reached the top five in Australia and the United Kingdom. \"Chocolate\" was released as the final single in June 2004 and peaked inside the top 10 in the United Kingdom. Minogue performed at a one-off concert show held at entertainment venue Hammersmith Apollo, London, on 15 November 2003 to mark the release of the album. No tickets were publicly made available for sale and only fans with invitations were allowed to attend the show, which was entitled \"Money Can't Buy\". Upon its release, Body Language received generally favourable to mixed reviews from music critics, many of whom complimented Minogue for experimenting with new genres and the overall production of the album. Some critics, however, opined that many songs lacked catchy material and were not suitable for dancing. Commercially, Body Language performed well, although it was not as successful as Fever. It peaked at number two on the albums chart of Australia and was certified double-platinum by the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA). In the United Kingdom, Body Language peaked at number six and was certified platinum by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI). Elsewhere, the album performed well in Austria and Switzerland. Body Language became notable for displaying another change in Minogue's persona and is cited as an example of her numerous \"reinventions\"."@en ;

dbr:Church_of_Hawkwind	rdf:type	schema:MusicAlbum ;
	dbo:abstract	"Church of Hawkwind is the twelfth studio album by Hawkwind, released under the band name Church of Hawkwind in 1982. The name change reflects the fact that this was a musical departure for the band, being a more experimental electronic offering rather than the usual heavy rock that the band were known for at the time. Dave Brock resurrects the \"Dr Technical\" alias which he had previously used for production of the band's 1972 hit single \"Silver Machine\". This is almost a Dave Brock solo album considering the heavy bias towards his work, and none of these tracks were performed live by the band, save \"Looking in the Future\" which was re-recorded as \"Letting in the Past\" on It is the Business of the Future to be Dangerous. \"The Phenomenon of Luminosity\" features a sample of John Glenn on the Friendship Seven spacecraft during the Mercury-Atlas 6 mission on 20 February 1962. An alternative version of \"Experiment With Destiny\" had appeared on the preceding year's Sonic Attack album as \"Virgin of the World\". Although credited to Dave Brock, the track \"Some People Never Die\" borrows much of its material from the track \"They Call Me Gun\" on an obscure LP \"On The Seventh Day\" (US Mercury Records 61248, 1970), right down to the Robert F. Kennedy and Lee Harvey Oswald shooting commentaries. An alternative edit of \"Some People Never Die\" is on \"SpaceBrock\" (2000). The CD bonus tracks on the 1994 Griffin release were recorded in the 1990s and seem at odds with the overall feel of the album, and they were placed in the middle of a resequenced side 2 disrupting the flow of the album, for example the rowing that linked \"Some People Never Die\" with \"Light Specific Data\" now has 5 tracks in between. The 2010 Atomhenge CD restores the original running order and provides a different set of bonus material."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Direct is a 1988 album by the Greek synthesizer artist Vangelis. The album marks a new development in Vangelis' music, employing a somewhat more popular format. After Mask (1984) and Invisible Connections (1985) there was a brief pause of album work, during which Vangelis moved his creative base from London to Greece, and was involved in theatre work. The album sleeve mentions that Vangelis called the album \"Direct\" to reflect his way of composing, in which the process of composition and recording occurs simultaneously, with few overdubs. This process was largely facilitated by the use of custom midi performance systems designed for Vangelis by technicians Bill Marshall and Pete Kellock, as well as the commercially available Zyklus MPS which was also developed by Marshall and Kellock. According to the sleeve, Direct was to be the first of a series of albums along the same musical approach. The album is almost completely instrumental, employing mainly synthesizers and drum machines. Operatic vocals on \"Glorianna\" are performed by the Greek mezzo-soprano Markella Hatziano (uncredited). The male narrative on \"Intergalactic Radio Station\" is performed by technician Casey Young. A bootleg featuring pre-mix versions of some of the tracks on the album is also known to exist."@en ;

The compilation is intended to be a career-spanning retrospective, and no fewer than two songs are selected from each of Bob Marley and the Wailers' albums with the company. Songs range from his first album for the label, Catch a Fire, and span all the way through to the last album Marley would live to see released in his lifetime, Uprising, concluding with the posthumous releases \"Iron Lion Zion,\" and tracks from Confrontation. This Gold compilation is not to be confused with another compilation Universal released later the same year under the Gold line, consisting of Marley's early pre-fame material with the Wailers dating from 1967-1972."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Gold is a two-CD compilation of classic singles and album tracks by British singer-songwriter, Cat Stevens, now known as Yusuf Islam. It is part of Universal Music's series of double-disc anthologies derived from their extensive back catalog. The track list starts with Stevens' early British hit \"Matthew & Son\" and ends with a new recording by Islam, \"Indian Ocean\", recorded and first released as a digital download on the iTunes Music Store to benefit 2004 Asian Tsunami relief efforts. One review of the compilation suggests that the anthology \"manages to cram into two discs what 2001's On the Road to Find Out box set tried to accomplish over four.\". Like the box set five years earlier, Islam actively participated in the compilation of the anthology. Given both the extensive track listing and the presence of a new Stevens recording (the first on which he has played guitar since he stopped recording under his stage name), this compilation apparently makes previous non-box set compilations of Stevens' work redundant and incomplete."@en ;

The album remains Adams' best-selling album, certifying gold in the UK and going on to sell 364,000 copies in the U.S. and 812,000 worldwide. Adams noted that \"with Gold, I was trying to prove something to myself. I wanted to invent a modern classic.\" Adams intended for the album to be a double album, but his record label, Lost Highway, condensed the album into a single disc. According to Adams, the label \"took the last five songs, made it a bonus disc and put it on the first hundred and fifty thousand copies. Fucking my fans over and making them pay extra for a record I wanted to be a double album. They counted that as one record.\" This bonus disc is known as Side Four; the disc's title reflects the fact that the bonus material makes up the fourth side of the double LP edition of the album. The album includes \"When the Stars Go Blue\", which has been covered by artists such as The Corrs and Bono, Tyler Hilton, Bethany Joy Galeotti, and Tim McGraw. \"New York, New York\" became a notable MTV and VH1 favorite following the September 11 attacks. \"The Rescue Blues\" was featured in the end credits of the 2001 film Behind Enemy Lines. Adams' friend and former roommate Adam Duritz (lead singer of Counting Crows) lends background vocals to several tracks. Adams received three Grammy Award nominations in 2002: Best Rock Album, Best Male Rock Vocal Performance for \"New York, New York\", and Best Male Country Vocal Performance for \"Lovesick Blues\". Stephen King's 2006 book Lisey's Story includes part of the lyrics to \"When the Stars Go Blue\". Also, the song \"The Rescue Blues\" was featured in an episode of Scrubs. In 2011, \"Answering Bell\" was featured in the film and on the soundtrack to Bridesmaids."@en ;

A sequel album \u2014 Machina II/The Friends & Enemies of Modern Music \u2014 was later released independently via the Internet. As with its predecessor, Adore, Machina represented a drastic image and sound change for the band that failed to reconnect the band with chart-topping success. However, after the relatively brief Adore tour, the new line-up with Chamberlin and the former Hole bass guitarist Melissa Auf der Maur mounted longer international tours that returned the live incarnation of the band to guitar-driven hard rock style. A remastered and expanded version of the album was announced as a part of the band's project to reissue their back catalogue from 1991 to 2000, though Corgan announced in July 2015 that the release was tied up in legal issues with their record label."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Mirage is the 13th studio album by Fleetwood Mac, released on June 18, 1982. Following a hiatus of over a year after the completion of the worldwide Tusk tour, the band temporarily relocated to Ch\u00E2teau d'H\u00E9rouville in France to record a new album. By this time Stevie Nicks and Lindsey Buckingham had each commenced a solo career, the former to multi-platinum #1 success with 1981's Bella Donna, the latter faring not as well with his first outing Law and Order (US Billboard #32). Mirage found the band venturing further into radio-friendly soft rock than it had in any of its previous incarnations. It stood in stark contrast to its highly experimental predecessor, 1979's Tusk. Mirage yielded several hit singles: \"Hold Me\" (which peaked at #4 on the US Billboard Pop Chart, remaining there for seven weeks), \"Love in Store\" (#22 US Pop Chart), \"Oh Diane\" (which reached #9 in the UK), and finally, \"Can't Go Back\" (issued on 7\" and 12\" in the UK). The Stevie Nicks composition \"Gypsy\" (#12 Pop, #4 Rock, and a #16 hit in Canada) was the second single from the album and was accompanied by a lengthy video, the highest-budget music video ever produced at the time,[citation needed] directed by Russell Mulcahy, and was the very first \"World Premiere Video\" on MTV in 1982.[citation needed] The single and album edit of \"Gypsy\" ran for only 4:24, but a 5\u00BD-minute version had been originally recorded and it was this version used for the video. This full-length version was not made available on CD until 1992's retrospective box set 25 Years \u2013 The Chain. Of the other two compositions from Nicks on the album, \"That's Alright\" dated back to the Buckingham/Nicks days of 1974, whilst \"Straight Back\" was written in the winter of 1981 and referred to her separation from (then) lover, producer Jimmy Iovine, and the huge wrench she experienced having to leave her newly established and highly successful solo career to re-join Fleetwood Mac for the 1982 project (Nicks refers to this on the DVD commentary to her 2008 retrospective Crystal Visions \u2013 The Very Best of Stevie Nicks). \"Straight Back\" was also a US rock radio hit in late 1982. The album returned the group to the top of the US Billboard charts for the first time since their 1977 album Rumours, spending five weeks at #1. It spent a total of 18 weeks in the US Top Ten and was certified double platinum for shipping 2,000,000 copies there. It also reached #5 in the UK where it was certified platinum for shipping 300,000 copies, and #2 in Australia.[citation needed]"@en ;

While the defunct Velvet Underground were at the peak of their popularity at the time, Reed's solo career had hit several lows during the 1980s, at least since his Blue Mask. However the widespread popularity of New York reignited his career to the extent that he could revive the Velvet Underground for an aborted world tour. The album is highly regarded for the strength and force of its lyrical content, but at the time drew criticism for its perceived pedestrian, \"truck driver,\" musicianship. Reed countered that he required simple music so that it would not distract from his frank lyrics. The single \"Dirty Blvd.\" was a #1 hit on the newly created Billboard Modern Rock Tracks chart for four weeks. Velvet Underground drummer Maureen Tucker played on two tracks.

The first single, \"She Never Said\", did not chart on the Australian Kent Music Report Singles Chart. The second single, \"The Unguarded Moment\", was co-written with Mikela Uniacke (aka Michelle Parker), who was married to Steve Kilbey at the time. This song launched the band to success and has been their biggest hit to date. It brought early attention and significant radio play to the band, it peaked at No. 22 in Australia and No. 19 in New Zealand.

	dbo:abstract	"Operation Phoenix is the fourth album by the Santa Cruz, California-based hardcore punk band Good Riddance, released May 4, 1999 through Fat Wreck Chords. It marked a change in recording location and production team for the band: their previous three albums had been recorded in San Francisco with producer and recording engineer Ryan Greene, but for Operation Phoenix the band traveled to Fort Collins, Colorado to record at The Blasting Room with Jason Livermore and Descendents/All members Bill Stevenson and Stephen Egerton. This marked the beginning of a long-term working relationship: Good Riddance would record all of their studio material at The Blasting Room using the same production team until 2003, when the band slipped into inactivity and singer Russ Rankin started Only Crime with Stevenson. Stevenson and Livermore would return to record and produce Good Riddance's final studio album My Republic in 2006, which was recorded in San Francisco. Rankin later commented that working with The Blasting Room team was a major turning point in recording for the band: Operation Phoenix was Good Riddance's last album with drummer Sean Sellers until 2006. Following his departure in late 1999, Lagwagon drummer Dave Raun filled in with the band until Dave Wagenschutz of Kid Dynamite joined as a permanent replacement. Sellers would return to Good Riddance in 2006 for My Republic and Remain in Memory: The Final Show."@en ;

Perdition City continues the experimentation seen on Themes from William Blake's The Marriage of Heaven and Hell and Metamorphosis, containing elements of trip hop, jazz, ambient music, spoken word and electronica. Described on its release as moody, atmospheric electronica, cinematic in scope, evoking a soundtrack for an imaginary film. Kerrang! praised the album, noting \"This ain't rock 'n roll. This is evolution on such a grand scale that most bands wouldn't even be able to wrap their tiny little minds around it.\" Musically, Ulver not only explores new genres, but also shift from extrovert, into more introverted moods, or interior music."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Polka Party! is the fourth studio album by \"Weird Al\" Yankovic, released in 1986. The album is the fourth of Yankovic's to be produced by former The McCoys guitarist Rick Derringer. Recorded between April 1986 and September 1986, the album was Yankovic's follow-up to his successful 1985 release, Dare to Be Stupid. The album's lead single was \"Living With a Hernia\", although it was not a hit and did not chart. The music on Polka Party is built around parodies and pastiches of pop and rock music of the mid-1980s, featuring jabs at James Brown, Mick Jagger, El DeBarge, and Robert Palmer. The album also features many \"style parodies\", or musical imitations that come close to, but do not copy, existing artists. These style parodies include imitations of specific artists like the Talking Heads, as well as imitations of various musical genres like country music. Peaking at only number 177 on the Billboard 200, Polka Party! was met with mixed reviews and was considered a commercial and critical failure. Despite this, the album was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Comedy Recording in 1986. Polka Party is one of Yankovic's few studio albums not to be certified either Gold or Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) and was later demoted to a budget release in 2009."@en ;

Ross peaked at #49 on the US Pop Albums chart, and #32 on Black Albums.The album failed to chart in the UK. Its final USA sales figures stood at around 150,000 copies. A different album also titled Ross was released on the RCA label in 1983. Several outtakes from the 1978 Ross sessions produced by Hal Davis, Greg Wright and Michael Masser have subsequently been issued on various other albums with Ross. Titles among these include \"You Build Me Up to Tear Me Down\", \"Sweet Summertime Livin'\", \"Share Some Love\", \"We're Always Saying Goodbye\", \"Fire Don't Burn\" and \"We Can Never Light That Old Flame Again\". Although only enjoying moderate chart success on its original release in 1978, in 2009 \"Lovin', Livin' and Givin'\" was one of thirteen tracks featured on Almighty Records' tribute/remix album We Love Diana Ross - The Remix Collection.

It is a concept album with a storyline telling the tale of a young couple who go to watch a puppet show in Budapest in the 1700s, and end up being turned into undead puppets by the Puppet Master and his wife. King Diamond meets Victoria after a Christmas show put on by the Puppet Master in Budapest. They kiss after the show and feel a \"magic\" come over them, intertwining their spirits together. One year after they meet, his beloved goes missing after wanting to see the show again and he sets out to find her. While searching, he comes across the Puppet Master's wife killing a homeless man. He follows her into a building where he is struck from behind and loses consciousness. When King regains consciousness, the puppet master is performing a ritual to exchange King's soul in order to imbue temporary life into his eyes. An accident during the ritual with the Devil leaves King Diamond's soul trapped within his permanently aware eyes. He then finds himself strapped to a hospital bed and The Puppet Master and his wife standing in front of him with a scalpel. The Puppet Master leans over him and says: \"First your eyes... then your skin... we will make you feel born again.\" and starts to cut out his eyes. One eyelid drops down into a jar. The Puppet Master uses an instrument to pull the eyeball out of its socket, and cuts off the nerve-string which is the only thing holding the eye in place. The Puppet Master then puts the eyeball into a puppet's eye socket. His body is being made into a puppet that comes to life when blood is injected into it. It is after this that he sees his wife's body, now a puppet, on another shelf in the Puppet Master's shop. King Diamond and his beloved are infused with a syringe-full of their blood nightly, so they can practice their routines and learn how to perform for their Master. Each night, after being put away, King and his beloved \"talk with their eyes\" from across the room as the essence of their blood fades away. King Diamond is forced to witness her fading away every night, because his immortal eyes keep him from slipping away like she does. Once instructed to dance by the Puppet Master, Victoria stumbles into the wall where jars of blood for the puppets are stored on shelves, knocking six of them down. She is then sent away to Berlin and King vows to find her again. Christmas time comes around for the third time in the tale, and King is to perform as The Little Drummer Boy. At his performance, he intentionally falls and breaks his drum to embarrass the Puppet Master. For his actions, he is sold to a shop and left nailed to the wall. At some point, he hears of how the Puppet Master is building a second theater in London, to be run by the Puppet Master's son and daughter and he re-affirms his vow to find his lost love or see her on the \"other side\"."@en ;
