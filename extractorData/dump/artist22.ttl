He committed suicide by jumping from a balcony. The postmortem examination of his body did not reveal any traces of alcohol or drugs. Nasyrov's supposed suicide has been disputed. Recent reports in the Russian press have implied that he may have been the victim of foul play, as family members and friends insist that Nasyrov was not depressed and had never considered suicide before. Some suspect that he was given an LSD tablet in a glass of wine at a club, and after drinking it, he experienced hallucinations and leapt off his balcony."@en .

As such, he was a model for Count Basie, Duke Ellington, Art Tatum, and Fats Waller. Johnson composed many hit tunes including the theme song of the Roaring Twenties, \"Charleston\" and \"If I Could be With You One Hour Tonight\" and remained the acknowledged king of New York jazz pianists through most of the 1930s. Johnson's artistry, his significance in the subsequent development of jazz piano, and his large contribution to American musical theatre, are often overlooked, and as such, he has been referred to by Reed College musicologist David Schiff, as \"The Invisible Pianist\"."@en .

Through the 1930s and 1940s he successfully navigated a transition in style to a more urban blues sound popular with working-class African-American audiences. In the 1950s a return to his traditional folk-blues roots made him one of the leading figures of the emerging American folk music revival and an international star. His long and varied career marks him as one of the key figures in the development of blues music in the 20th century. Broonzy copyrighted more than 300 songs during his lifetime, including both adaptations of traditional folk songs and original blues songs. As a blues composer, he was unique in writing songs that reflected his rural-to-urban experiences."@en ;

Danell formed Social Distortion in 1979 with frontman Mike Ness while attending high school together. Originally the group's bassist, Danell switched to guitar after some band defections, and helped define the group's signature jangle on such albums as Mommy's Little Monster (1983), Prison Bound (1988), Social Distortion (1990), Somewhere Between Heaven and Hell (1992) and White Light, White Heat, White Trash (1996). He remained the guitarist for the band until his death, from an apparent brain aneurysm (Mike Ness stated on the DVD commentary of Another State of Mind that Dennis died from a heart condition), at his Costa Mesa, California home at the age of 38, while in the process of moving to his new home in Newport Beach. \"I am saddened beyond any possible form of expression,\" Ness said in a statement. \"Dennis and I have been friends since boyhood, starting Social Distortion together while we were in high school. My deepest regrets to his family.\" After Social Distortion went on hiatus following the release of Live at the Roxy in 1998, Danell produced numerous local bands at the group's recording studio, Casbah, in Fullerton, California. His production credits included Fanmail (BEC Records), Value Pac (Four Door Entertainment), Fraidy Cats (Bulletproof Records), The Deluxtone Rockets (Tooth & Nail Records), and Rock Star Barbecue, the debut artist on Danell's new independent label, Masterpiece Records. By 2000, Danell was quickly becoming a much sought-after producer in the Orange County area. Danell also started a new side band called Strung Gurus, with Michael Knott of the Orange County band, Aunt Betty's (formerly on Elektra). Danell produced, co-wrote and played guitar for them, whilst working on their first full-length album. The Strung Gurus debut, to be the second release on Masterpiece Records, was nearly completed. In an interview for the Strung Gurus promotional bio, Danell had said, \"I am very excited about Strung Gurus because the music is high energy and commercial, but it does not sound like Social Distortion. The new band allows me to stretch as a songwriter and producer by tackling a sound outside my comfort zone.\" Rough mixes of four Strung Gurus songs were already in limited circulation and had started a buzz among fans and local journalists impressed with Danell's versatility and writing abilities."@en ;

It also spent five weeks at number one in the UK singles chart, with Meek receiving an Ivor Novello Award for this production as the \"Best-Selling A-Side\" of 1962.

He also produced music for films such as Live It Up! (US title Sing and Swing, 1963), a pop music film which featured Gene Vincent, the Outlaws pop group, jazz musician Kenny Ball and others. Meek's concept album I Hear a New World (1960), which contains innovative use of electronic sounds, was not fully released in his lifetime. His reputation for experiments in recording music was acknowledged by the Music Producers Guild who in 2009 created \"The Joe Meek Award for Innovation in Production\" as an \"homage to [the] remarkable producer's pioneering spirit\". In 2014, Meek was ranked the greatest producer of all time by NME, elaborating: \"Meek was a complete trailblazer, attempting endless new ideas in his search for the perfect sound. ... The legacy of his endless experimentation is writ large over most of your favourite music today.\" At the time of his death, Meek possessed thousands of unreleased recordings later dubbed \"The Tea Chest Tapes\". His commercial success as a producer was short-lived, and he gradually sank into debt and depression. On 3 February 1967, using a shotgun owned by musician Heinz Burt, Meek killed his landlady Violet Shenton and then shot himself."@en ;

Anderson attended Montclair High School where he learned to play the trombone, eventually picking up guitar & bass guitar. He later attended the Berklee College of Music contemporaneously with Pat Metheny & Al DiMeola after working with an early version of Aerosmith in the Boston music scene. He joined The Centurions, which brought him to the attention of Chris Wood of Traffic, who invited him to play on the band's next album. The Traffic album involvement never materialized, but led to Anderson becoming employed by Traffic's record label Island Records, leading to him being asked to play lead guitar on Bob Marley & The Wailers' Natty Dread sessions. Anderson played lead guitar on \"Crazy Baldhead\" and on the Live! album, remaining with the band until 1976, when he joined Word, Sound and Power, backing Peter Tosh on the albums Legalise It and Equal Rights. He returned to Marley's band and played on the Survival and Uprising albums. After Marley's death, Anderson continued to tour with The Wailers Band. Al went on to record with Ben Harper (Diamonds On the Inside (2003)) and also Lauryn Hill on her multi-Grammy winning debut \"The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill\" (1998). He also produced and performed on an album for actor Steven Seagal (Songs from the Crystal Cave (2005)). In 2008 he formed the band The Original Wailers with Junior Marvin."@en ;

She changed her surname to Myles at age 19 after deciding to pursue a career in entertainment. Appearances in TV commercials paid for music demos which weathered countless rejections from her homeland, Canada, until she recorded masters for three songs; \"Who Loves You\" and a video demo for \"Just One Kiss\" directed by photographer Deborah Samuel. With matched financing from her songwriting collaborator, Much Music (City TV) VJ and program director Christopher Ward and FACTOR, she signed her first record contract with Atlantic Records in 1987. In fall of 1987, Warner Music Canada's director of artists and repertoire (A&R) Bob Roper sent the three-song video package to all of Warner Music Group's U.S. affiliates which garnered a seven-eight year contract from Atlantic Records (WMG) sight unseen by head of A&R Tunc Erim and Atlantic label founder Ahmet Ertegun. Myles left her acting career, co-wrote and recorded the remainder of her first album with Christopher Ward and producer David Tyson. In 1989, Atlantic Records released her self titled debut album and Myles toured internationally for 18 months. Her first album was awarded the Diamond Award for sales of over one million units; she is the only Canadian debut artist to attain that award. Her first album was reported to have sold upwards of 6 million copies internationally and remains a classic-selling album. Myles' eponymous debut album achieved top 10 hits in several countries around the world beginning with \"Love Is\", \"Still Got This Thing For You.' The only single to hit number one in 1990 in Canada was \"Lover of Mine\". Alannah's fourth American 1990 single, \"Black Velvet.\" hit number one for two weeks with a bullet on the U.S. Billboard Top 40 Chart to become a worldwide classic radio hit. It also won the 1990 Grammy Award for Best Female Rock Vocal Performance. In 1992, Myles was nominated for a second Grammy award for Best Female Rock Vocal Performance for the title track \"Rockinghorse\", the flip side of lead off single, \"Song Instead of a Kiss\" from her second CD Rockinghorse. \"Song Instead Of A Kiss\" was a 60-piece orchestrated ballad that reached number one on several radio stations around the globe but was met with little response in America, whose audiences were accustomed to \"that slow southern style\" of Black Velvet."@en .

The Jazz Messengers were formed as a collective of contemporaries, but over the years the band became known as an incubator for young talent, including Freddie Hubbard, Wayne Shorter, Lee Morgan, Benny Golson, and Wynton Marsalis. The Biographical Encyclopedia of Jazz calls the Jazz Messengers \"the archetypal hard bop group of the late 50s\".

He made his debut at age 18 by joining a student band, having just graduated from the \"Gheorghe \u015Eincai\" high school in Bucharest. His official debut was made by performing for radio audiences in 1937.

Some music critics have compared his talent and public appeal to the likes of Frank Sinatra or Maurice Chevalier. His showmanship and charm was able to attract audiences of all ages, while his music influences combine folk with classical orchestra arrangements. He holds the record for the number of most original (composed and performed) songs (over 1,500), in an amazingly varied discography, many of which became national hits and which were covered again and again by other Romanian artists. Some of those hits are: \n* C\u0103su\u0163a noastr\u0103 (Our Little House) \n* Bucuresti, Bucure\u015Fti \n* D\u0103-i cu \u015Fpri\u0163ul p\u00E2n' la ziu\u0103  \n* Uite-a\u015Fa a\u015F vrea s\u0103 mor (Look, This Is How I'd Like To Die) On 5 May 2003, then-President of Romania Ion Iliescu appointed Gic\u0103 Petrescu as a Knight of the Order of the Star of Romania as he celebrated his 88th birthday.

Born into a musical family, he spent his early childhood in a small town in Transylvania. He quickly proved himself to be a child prodigy on the violin, and moved to Budapest with his father to study with the renowned pedagogue Jen\u0151 Hubay. After completing his studies with Hubay in his early teens, Szigeti began his international concert career. His performances at that time were primarily limited to salon-style recitals and the more overtly virtuosic repertoire; however, after making the acquaintance of pianist Ferruccio Busoni, he began to develop a much more thoughtful and intellectual approach to music that eventually earned him the nickname \"The Scholarly Virtuoso\". Following a bout of tuberculosis that required a stay in a sanatorium in Switzerland, Szigeti settled in Geneva, where he became Professor of Violin at the local conservatory in 1917. It was in Geneva that he met his future wife, Wanda Ostrowska, and at roughly the same time he became friends with the composer B\u00E9la Bart\u00F3k. Both relationships were to be lifelong. From the 1920s until 1960, Szigeti performed regularly around the world and recorded extensively. He also distinguished himself as a strong advocate of new music, and was the dedicatee of many new works by contemporary composers. Among the more notable pieces written for him are Ernest Bloch's Violin Concerto, Bart\u00F3k's Rhapsody No. 1, and Eug\u00E8ne Ysa\u00FFe's Solo Sonata No. 1. After retiring from the concert stage in 1960, he worked at teaching and writing until his death in 1973, at the age of 80."@en .

She was born in Japan, Fukuoka, debuting in 1986 as an idol singer identity, when her short hair style, sweet smile, youthful image became a talking point. Sakai released her debut single, \"Otoko no Ko ni Naritai\" (\u7537\u306E\u30B3\u306B\u306A\u308A\u305F\u3044, \"I Want to Be a Boy\") on February 5, 1987, nine days short of her sixteenth birthday. Over 40,000 copies of the single were sold. In the early years of her career, she used the nickname Nori-P (\u306E\u308A\u30D4\u30FC), although around the mid-1990s she started to distance herself from it. She ventured overseas in the 1990s to Taiwan to shoot VITALON P beverage commercials, as well as holding concerts which received praise. Sakai returned to after 1993, where she received recognition for her acting in Hitotsu Yane no Shita as Kashiwagi Koyuki. In 1995, she acted in Hoshi no Kinka (Heaven's Coins) as Aya Kuramoto, also singing the theme song Aoi Usagi (\u78A7\u3044\u3046\u3055\u304E, \"blue rabbit\") which became her best selling album to date. By the end of 1998 she organized the Asian concert tours throughout Taiwan, mainland China, Singapore, South Korea, Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand and other countries in the regions. In December 28, 1998, she suddenly held a reporter conference, announcing her marriage to Y\u016Bichi Takas\u014D (\u9AD8\u76F8 \u7950\u4E00 Takas\u014D Y\u016Bichi). In January 2000, after the birth of her son, Sakai made a comeback to showbiz, and gradually took on roles in movies, drama and advertising. Sakai's popularity in Japan is not outstanding, but she has considerable supporters in Hong Kong, Taiwan and mainland China. August 2009, Sakai was arrested on suspicion of possession and abuse of drugs and sentenced to probation for three years. She divorced after the incident and temporarily stayed away from the media circle. After her probation ended, she began rehearsals for the theater, and signed on with Office Nigun Niiba, as a first step towards returning to the media committee."@en ;

She first gained attention in 1979 with the release of her hit single \"Lucky Number\", which peaked at number 3 on the UK Singles Chart and made her a leading figure of the new wave music scene. Born in Detroit, Michigan, Lovich moved to England at the age of 13, where she met guitarist and songwriter Les Chappell, who later became her long-time music collaborator and life partner. She developed an interest in art and theater, enrolling at the Central School of Art and Design where she took saxophone lessons. In 1975, she joined the band the Diversions and shortly afterwards wrote the lyrics to Cerrone's single \"Supernature\". After the band broke up, Lovich started looking for another band that would let her join and contacted the radio presenter Charlie Gillett, who got her to record a demo of Tommy James and the Shondells' song \"I Think We're Alone Now\" and played it to Dave Robinson of Stiff Records, who decided to sign Lovich. The song was released as a single and appeared on her debut studio album Stateless (1978), which produced the single \"Lucky Number\". She released two more albums, Flex (1979) and No Man's Land (1982), on Stiff Records. In 1989, she independently released the album March, before her 15-year hiatus. She focused more on her family but came back in 2005 with the release of her album Shadows and Dust.

	dbo:abstract	"Bennie Moten (November 13, 1894 \u2013 April 2, 1935) was an American jazz pianist and band leader born in Kansas City, Missouri. He led the Kansas City Orchestra, the most important of the regional, blues-based orchestras active in the Midwest in the 1920s, and helped to develop the riffing style that would come to define many of the 1930s Big Bands. His first recordings were made (for OKeh Records) in 1923, and were rather typical interpretations of the New Orleans style of King Oliver and others. They also showed the influence of the ragtime that was still popular in the area, as well as the stomping beat that the band was famous for. These OKeh sides (recorded 1923\u20131925) are some of the more valuable acoustic jazz 78s of the era and continue to be treasured records in many serious jazz collections. They signed with Victor Records in 1926, and were influenced by the more sophisticated style of Fletcher Henderson, but more often than not featured a hard stomp beat that was extremely popular in Kansas City. Moten remained one of Victor's most popular orchestras through 1930. The song Kansas City Shuffle was recorded during this time. (The band recorded prolifically and many of their records were issued in Victor's regular series, therefore not specifically marketed to the Black community.) By 1928 Moten's piano was showing some boogie woogie influences, but the real revolution came in 1929 when he recruited Count Basie, Walter Page and Oran 'Hot Lips' Page. Walter Page's walking bass lines gave the music an entirely new feel compared to the 2/4 tuba of his predecessor Vernon Page, coloured by Basie's understated, syncopated piano fills. Another boon to the band was adding Jimmy Rushing as their primary vocalist. Their final session (10 recordings made at Victor's Camden, New Jersey, studios on December 13, 1932, during a time when the band was suffering significant financial hardship) showed the early stages of what became known as the \"Basie sound\", four years before Basie recorded under his own name. By this time Ben Webster and Rushing had joined Moten's band, but Moten himself did not play on these sessions. These sides (mostly arranged by Eddie Durham) include a number of tunes that later became swing classics: \n*  \"Toby\" \n*  \"Moten Swing\" \n*  \"The Blue Room\" \n*  \"Imagination\" (vocals: Sterling Russell Trio) \n*  \"New Orleans\" (vocal: Jimmy Rushing) \n*  \"The Only Girl I Ever Loved\" (vocals: Sterling Russell Trio) \n*  \"Milenberg Joys\" \n*  \"Lafayette\" \n*  \"Prince of Wails\" (often mistitled as \"Prince of Wales\") \n*  \"Two Times\" (recorded with six musicians and with vocalist Josephine Garrison) Moten died at Kansas City's Wheatley-Provident Hospital on April 2, 1935 following a failed tonsillectomy operation. Basie, subsequently, took many of the leading musicians from the band to form his own orchestra. Moten's popular 1928 recording of \"South\" on Victor V-38021 (itself a remake of the first version on OKeh from late 1924) stayed in Victor's catalog over the years (reissued as 24893 in 1935 as Victor phased out any remaining V-38000 series that were still in the catalog) and became a big jukebox hit in the late 1940s (by then, reissued as 44-0004). It remained in print (as a vinyl 45) until RCA stopping making vinyl records."@en ;

He gained prominence in 1950 after two major hits, and throughout the decade was a very popular country performer. He smoothed out the rough edges of a honky tonk song by sounding out syllables longer and singing longer. Because of this, his music become much more mainstream without losing its honky-tonk attitude and persona. Frizzell is an influential artist in country music history. Among the artists he influenced are George Jones, Willie Nelson, Roy Orbison, The Everly Brothers, Keith Whitley, Merle Haggard, and John Fogerty. He laid a foundation for the many generations of country music performers that followed him. Because of this, he was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame in 1982. Though he started his career being influenced by other country musicians, in the 1950s Frizzell became one of country music's most well-known artists. After the death of Hank Williams in 1953, Frizzell released many songs that charted in the Top 10 of the Hot Country Songs charts. His success did not carry on into the 1960s, and after suffering from alcoholism, he died at age 47."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Christina 'Licorice' McKechnie (born 2 October 1945 in Edinburgh, Scotland) is a Scottish musician. She was a singer and songwriter in the Incredible String Band between 1968 and 1972. After reading her poetry at folk clubs in Edinburgh, she met musician Robin Williamson, but left home in her teens with the intention of marrying Bert Jansch. The banns were published but the wedding never took place. Jansch left her behind to travel to Morocco in 1963, and, according to Williamson, \"she fell into [my] arms\". In 1966 she travelled to Morocco with Williamson, and was later involved in the Incredible String Band's recordings. Her first contribution to the band came in the form of backing vocals on the 1967 album The 5000 Spirits or the Layers of the Onion on the track \"Painting Box\". By 1968, she was regarded as a fully-fledged member of the band, usually as a backing singer and percussionist. She appeared with them when they played at the Woodstock Festival in August 1969, but left in 1972 after the end of her relationship with Williamson. In 1974, McKechnie appeared onstage at a Scientology benefit in East Grinstead with Mike Garson, Woody Woodmansey, Leonard Halliwell and others, before moving to California and joining the Silver Moon Band. She married musician Brian Lambert and appeared with Robin Williamson with his Merry Band in 1977 (she is credited as Likky Lambert on the 1977 album Journey's Edge) before joining Woody Woodmansey's band U-Boat. She and Lambert later divorced. She visited Edinburgh in 1986 to see her family, but her whereabouts have been unknown since 1990, when, according to her sister, she was in Sacramento, California, apparently recovering from surgery. Music journalist Mark Ellen wrote a lengthy retrospective about the Incredible String Band for MOJO magazine in 2000, which stated:LICORICE McKECHNIE: Last seen in 1987 hitchhiking across the Arizona Desert. Not even her family has heard from her since. Rose (Simpson): \" . . . There's a possibility she may be dead.\""@en ;

He made his debut at the age of 16 in the K\u014D Nakahira film Crazed Fruit in 1956. Tsugawa's family was heavily involved in the film industry since before his birth. Tsugawa attended school until dropping out of the Waseda University Graduate School to pursue acting alone. He gradually grew in popularity and appeared in films like Otoko wa tsurai yo: Watashi no tora-san and Godzilla, Mothra and King Ghidorah: Giant Monsters All-Out Attack. He was eventually adopted as one of director Juzo Itami's favourite actors, and went on to appear in nearly every one of his movies since Tampopo. Tsugawa recently debuted as a director under the pseudonym Makino Masahiko with his film Nezu no Ban. He chose this name because he is the nephew of the Japanese director Masahiro Makino, his mother's brother. Legend has it that Tsugawa was so awed by the director while watching him at work as a young child that he asked if he could use Makino as his last name should he ever be a director, because of the similarities of the first names. Tsugawa comes from an illustrious film family. His older brother Hiroyuki Nagato is an actor. His wife Yukiji Asaoka is an actress. His grandfather is the director Sh\u014Dz\u014D Makino, his father, Kunitar\u014D Sawamura, and his mother, Tomoko Makino, were both actors.

She is considered among the most famous people in the Israeli entertainment industry, and was labeled \"one of the hottest new artists to break into the United States.\" Ninet has released four successful albums in Israel (one of them in English), and has twice won Israel's Favorite Act at the MTV Europe Music Awards. She has also worked with producer Mike Crossey (who produced her third album, Sympathetic Nervous System), and artists such as Steven Wilson (Ninet performs on his solo albums, Hand. Cannot. Erase. and 4 \u00BD), Gary Lucas, Cyndi Lauper, The Jesus and Mary Chain, and The Dead Daisies. Alongside her musical career, Ninet enjoyed a successful acting career, performing both in movies and the theatre. She currently lives in Tel Aviv and is married to music producer and guitarist Yossi Mizrachi. After achieving almost everything that her local scene can offer, Ninet has set her sights on the international stage, looking to impact her music to larger audiences worldwide. Nowadays, with multiple projects under her belt, she is \"poised to have a major breakthrough in the U.S with her American debut album coming out the latter part of 2016.\" Ninet is expected to begin her first high-profile international tour in the U.S, Canada (Toronto & Montreal), and Europe, at early 2016. The tour will feature songs from her upcoming release. It will be her 5th album, and the first to be released and promoted in the U.S. As part of her tour, Ninet has already been selected to perform at SXSW in March. She is also planned to tour as a featured guest vocalist on Steven Wilson's tour, whom after their successful collaborations in the past, invited her to join him for several performances. The upcoming 2016 tour is the result of Ninet's recent and short visit to the U.S in 2015, which created an intensive buzz and high demand for this \"infectious female artist\". During her time in the U.S, Ninet performed several concerts in New York City, which were praised by the critics. One of them, who attended one of her shows, proudly stated that \"having seen Ninet perform \u2026 it\u2019s safe to say that the entire audience was fixated and almost hypnotized by her presence.\" Others claimed that \"her bold renditions of songs like 'Crazy' and her original releases have showcased the range in which she approaches music and thus identifies with at least some part of all of us.\" In preparation for her upcoming tour, Ninet released two new singles from her forthcoming album \u2013 \"Paper Parachute\" and \"Child\". The two \"promise an album worth waiting for\", and were ultimately declared as ones in which Ninet's \"haunting vocals are backed by clever production work and energy fulfilling beats\"."@en .

Casale's music career spans more than 40 years. He came to prominence in the late 1970s as co-founder and bass player of the new wave band Devo, which released a Top 20 hit in 1980 with the single \"Whip It\". Casale is one of the main composers of Devo's music, and made major lyrical contributions to the band's songs, while also designing Devo's distinctive attire (including the energy dome, plastic pompadours, and yellow radiation suits) over the years with Mark Mothersbaugh, and directed most of Devo's music videos. He is one of only two members (along with lead singer and keyboardist Mothersbaugh) who have been with Devo throughout its entire history. Casale began his solo career in 2005 while still a member of Devo with the project Jihad Jerry & the Evildoers. The project received little promotion beyond a music video for the single \"Army Girls Gone Wild.\" Jihad Jerry performed at several shows near the end of Devo's 2006 tour, performing the song \"Beautiful World\". He has also performed occasionally with other bands. Casale has also directed music videos for other recording artists, including The Cars (\"Touch and Go\"), Rush (\"Mystic Rhythms\"), A Perfect Circle (\"Imagine\"), Foo Fighters (\"I'll Stick Around\"), Soundgarden (\"Blow Up the Outside World\"), and Silverchair (\"Freak\" and \"Cemetery\"), among others."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Jay Sean (born Kamaljit Singh Jhooti; 26 March 1979) is a British singer and songwriter. He debuted in the UK's Asian Underground scene as a member of the Rishi Rich Project with \"Dance with You\", which reached No. 12 on the UK Singles Chart in 2003. This led to him being signed to Virgin Records and having two UK top 10 hits as a solo artist in 2004: \"Eyes On You\" at No. 6 and \"Stolen\" at #4. They were included in his critically acclaimed debut album Me Against Myself which, though only moderately successful in the UK, sold more than two million copies across Asia and remains his most successful album to date. Alongside the Rishi Rich Project, Sean was a pioneer of Bhangra-R&B fusion, which his debut album helped popularize among the worldwide South Asian diaspora. He eventually left Virgin in 2006 and founded his own independent label, Jayded Records. After a gap of nearly four years, he returned in 2008 with \"Ride It\", which reached No. 11 in the UK and topped the charts in several Eastern European countries, including Romania where it was one of the best-selling singles of the year. It was followed by hits such as \"Maybe\", which reached No. 7 on the Japan Hot 100, and \"Tonight\". They were included in his second album, My Own Way, which became his most successful album on the UK Albums Chart, reaching No. 6, and topped the UK R&B Chart. At around this time, he began increasingly incorporating electropop sounds into his R&B music. Since the end of 2008, he has been signed to Cash Money Records. In 2009, his American debut single \"Down\" topped the Billboard Hot 100, making him the first solo artist of South Asian origin and first UK urban act to top the Hot 100. It was the seventh-best selling song of 2009, having sold more than three million copies in the United States that year, eventually reaching six million sales in the United States, making him the most successful British/European male urban artist in US chart history at the time. As of 2011, it is the fifth best selling song by a British artist in the digital era. It was soon followed by another hit, \"Do You Remember\", which has sold more than a million copies in the US, and entered the top ten on the Hot 100, making him the first male act since Chingy in 2003 to \"simultaneously appear in the Hot 100 top 10 with his first two charting singles.\" They were included in his American-debut album All or Nothing, which debuted at No. 37 on the US Billboard 200 and reached No. 11 on the Japan Oricon Albums Chart. Sean has also been a featured artist on several hits including \"What Happened to Us\" by Australian singer Jessica Mauboy, which charted within the top 20 on the ARIA singles chart and certified platinum by the Australian Recording Industry Association. Sean was ranked No. 35 in Billboard's Hot 100 Artists of 2009."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Jesus \"Jesse\" Ernesto Pintado Andrade (July 12, 1969 \u2013 August 27, 2006) was a lead guitar player born in Mexico who at an early age moved to the US. He started in the grindcore band Terrorizer where he recorded the album World Downfall, the first album to feature Pete Sandoval who would later leave the band to join Morbid Angel. It was Jesse Pintado who coined the term \"grindcore\" for the first time (in 1983), to describe a musical mixture of \"noise and chaos\" which he was developing at that time. He lived in Huntington Park, California (his home address was even on the booklet of the \"World Downfall\" CD for contacting), but moved to Birmingham, England after he joined Napalm Death, where he replaced guitarist Bill Steer immediately prior to the recording of their album Harmony Corruption. In 2004 he officially left Napalm Death and revived Terrorizer, recruiting Tony Norman of Monstrosity and Anthony Rezhawk of Resistant Culture; he and Pete Sandoval were the only original members. Besides Terrorizer and Napalm Death he also played in Lock Up and Brujeria (see discography below). Both bands also featured Napalm Death bass player Shane Embury. His last residence was Ridderkerk in the Netherlands, and a few weeks after the release of Terrorizer's second album, he died in a hospital in the Netherlands due to liver failure after a diabetes-induced coma. His death also stemmed from excessive drinking."@en ;

During 1983, one of the first records to use digital sampling, \"IOU\", featured Rocca's falsetto voice and became one of the major dance successes of the 1980s electro music style. It scored number one in dance charts in Europe and the US Billboard Hot Dance Music/Club Play, and had popular music chart success across the world spending three weeks at number 2 in the UK. As a solo artist, Rocca scored number one again, this time with \"I Want It To Be Real\", on the US Hot Dance Music/Club Play chart during 1984. Rocca retired from the music business during 1993.

	dbo:abstract	"Leeroy Thornhill (born 7 October 1969, Barking, East London) is an English electronic music artist and formerly a rave dancer and occasionally keyboardist for the British breakbeat band The Prodigy. He is an international inspirational dance legend, known worldwide as 'The Prodigy Dancer.' Leeroy is a master shuffler and one of the great innovators of 'The Running Man' dance step, which he developed and took to the next level after first studying James Brown, and later Rosie Perez in the opening credits of Spike Lee\u2019s 1989 film Do The Right Thing. His style of dance has reportedly had a major influence in the development of the Melbourne Shuffle underground rave dance style, and thus Leeroy Thornhill was interviewed for the underground dance documentary Melbourne Shuffler to talk about his dancing. He has produced solo work under the names Longman and Flightcrank. He was born in Barking but raised in Rayne near Braintree in Essex, and grew up as a football and James Brown fan. Thornhill joined The Prodigy along with Keith Flint and Maxim Reality after they met Liam Howlett at a local rave club. Both were dancers for the band's live show. Thornhill's height is 6-foot 7 inches (200 cm), a whole foot taller than Flint who is 5-foot 7 inches (170 cm). In 2000 Thornhill left the band and went on to record various EPs under the guises of Longman and Flightcrank, however these projects never saw any substantial success. He now DJs at large venues and is still in touch with The Prodigy. During The Prodigy's 'Their Law' tour Thornhill was the DJ support act at several venues. He also works as a regular DJ. He also remixed tracks for other artists, such as the Italian Subsonica's Nuvole Rapide. Thornhill is currently working with Hyper and appears on their live shows. He appeared at the V Festival in 2007 in Chelmsford, Essex. His latest project is the creation of Nu skool breaks record label Electric Tastebuds. He has recently signed breakbeat act The Wrongstar Society to the label. In October 2008, a music video was created for \"Everything U Need\", a track by Thornhill's Smash Hi-Fi project. The video was Directed by Philip Carrer and Bleeding Apple."@en ;

His previous bands include The Prize Fight and Smash Adams. In early 2004, Vasoli also had a short-lived side-project called Statue, with members of The Prize Fight and Inkling. On September 29, 2010 it was announced on Say Anything's website that Vasoli would be playing bass for them on their upcoming fall tour with Motion City Soundtrack, and Saves The Day, replacing ex-bassist Alex Kent. Kenny has performed guest vocals and played bass for many artists including The Early November, Hot Rod Circuit, The Prize Fight, Death in the Park, Shadows in Lakeland, The Almost, The Junior Varsity, Hit The Lights, Zolof the Rock and Roll Destroyer, Mae, Valencia, and Say Anything. He provided guest vocals on the song So Close by the pop punk/hardcore band Such Gold, from their 2010 release Pedestals.

Having started his career as a drummer and eventually as a programmer, he became a remix engineer starting in the mid-1990s. His friendship with Dwayne Goettel led to him doing a small amount of keyboard work on the Skinny Puppy album The Process, as well as creating the Subconscious record label with Goettel in 1993. After Goettel's death from a heroin overdose in 1995, he became partners with Cevin Key in several musical projects. As an engineer, or remix engineer, he has worked with Skinny Puppy, Mirror, Bryan Adams and Nine Inch Nails. He has also assisted in remixes of songs written by Monster Magnet and Rob Halford and Metallica among others. Often maintaining a low visibility in his collaborative projects, it was his solo work which brought his abilities to light for fans of Download - a complex approach to rhythm and programming, and a sense of melody rooted in psychedelia, drones and space rock. Since 2001, Western has been the operator behind The Record Company, which has been the imprint for several releases under his own name, as well as a reissue of the Floatpoint CD \"Beam Error\""@en ;
