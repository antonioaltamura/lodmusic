	dbo:abstract	"Julie Sokolow (born April 3, 1987) is an American lo-fi singer-songwriter, writer, and independent filmmaker. She was raised in Holmdel Township, New Jersey and currently resides in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. At nineteen, she released a lo-fi indie album, \u201CSomething About Violins\u201D, through Western Vinyl that achieved acclaim from Pitchfork, Wire, and The Washington Post. Often drawing comparisons to Cat Power and Mirah,Sokolow has gained acclaim for her decidedly lo-fi sound; the entirety of Something About Violins was recorded using the built-in microphone of her PowerBook G4. Her music, which predominantly consists simply of her vocals and acoustic guitar, has been noted for its subtletly and introspectiveness. Sokolow has also been heralded not just for the intimacy of her music, but for her awareness of her own fragile emotional state. All of the work on Something About Violins, including mixing, instrumentation, and album packaging art, was done by Sokolow herself. After graduating from the University of Pittsburgh, she began to direct independent documentaries that have appeared at TIME and Huffington Post. In 2014, The New York Times profiled Sokolow and the documentary series she created: \"Healthy Artists\". The series highlights the lives, talents, and struggles of uninsured artists in America. In 2014, her short film \"Street Doctor\" went viral. In 2015, Sokolow released her first documentary feature, \"Aspie Seeks Love\", which went on to win the Cinequest Film Festival award for Best Documentary Feature Film. The film chronicles David V. Matthews, an offbeat writer on a quest to find love after a late-in-life Aspergers diagnosis. She produced, directed, and edited the film, in addition to composing the score. Sokolow\u2019s work is often character-driven and explores the friction between the individual and society."@en ;

She is known for her deep, power-house voice. Within two years of her debut, she set herself apart from all the singers of her generation by singing provocative songs, with a chameleon-like image change with the release of each new single. Her mature and rebellious image was to be the direct opposite of the other pop rival, Seiko Matsuda, who projected a girl next door, sweet-natured charm. The media competed them against each other throughout the 1980s, scrutinizing every details of their lives and supposed rivalry. During that period, Nakamori always expressed admiration for Matsuda, even humming her songs when both happen to be on the same shows. Her hair style and dress sense was widely copied by teens in the 80s. Music wise, her recording company molded her to be a successor to the mature and sophisticated Momoe Yamaguchi, a singer who retired at age 21 to get married. Her songs were always of heartbreaks, or rebellion, never straying far from the mold."@en .

Music has been a tradition in her family (with both her father and grandfather having worked as performers) \u2013 and music was a focal point in her upbringing. In Nashville, she attended Harpeth Hall \u2013 a girls' school with a national clientele and a strong performing arts program, counting Amy Grant and Reese Witherspoon among its alumnae.In 2002, at the age of 14, she was one of seven finalists (chosen by music industry professionals) at the second annual Nashville Grammy Showcase, hosted by the Nashville Chapter of the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences (NARAS).A versatile performer, she is primarily a singer-songwriter, but has also studied dance and has acted in various television productions, including an NBC Movie of the Week and several TV specials, among them a TNN Entertainment Special.

Alana performed on the entire Vans Warped Tour. In March 2010, a new Alana Grace song, \"7 Month Itch,\" from her upcoming third album, premiered on her official website for streaming.

Currently, Alana Grace is the lead vocalist of the band This Is She (formerly known as TOY). This Is She\u2019s history goes back to Warped Tour 2009, when Alana Grace\u2019s earlier solo project was playing the same stages as After Midnight Project, which included members Ryan Folden (drums) and Christian Paul Meadows (guitar).

Hanoi Rocks was a Finnish rock band that combined elements of punk, glam rock, rock and roll, and blues. Before his tenure in Hanoi Rocks, Suicide played guitar in a Finnish punk band called Briard in the late 1970s. Suicide replaced Andy McCoy in Briard after McCoy joined Pelle Miljoona Oy. After the breakup of Hanoi Rocks in 1985, he and his former band mate Andy McCoy recorded an acoustic album under the name The Suicide Twins which was released in 1986 and was titled Silver Missiles and Nightingales. At the same time McCoy and Suicide started The Cherry Bombz, which included Timo Caltio on bass (later replaced by Dave Tregenna), Terry Chimes on drums and singer Anita Chellemah. The Cherry Bombz released two EPs: The Cherry Bombz (1985) and House Of Ecstasy (1986) as well as a live album, Coming Down Slow (1986). After The Cherry Bombz Nasty went on to form his own band Cheap and Nasty, from 1990 to 1994. In 1988 Suicide made a short appearance in Guns N' Roses music video for \"Paradise City\". Nasty Suicide also appears on Michael Monroe's second solo album Not Fakin' It, released in 1989, as a co-writer and guitarist. Suicide was also a member of Monroe's band Demolition 23 in the early nineties, where he replaced the original guitarist. After the breakup of Demolition 23 Suicide recorded an album under his given name, titled \"Vinegar Blood\" in 1995 and was released in Finland only. Suicide retired from the rock scene in mid-nineties and moved back to Finland (which was the reason why Demolition 23 broke up), where he finally finished his studies in High School. After graduating from High School he educated himself as a pharmacist and works currently in a drug company in Finland. Suicide made a few guest appearances with the reformed Hanoi Rocks in the 2000s. In 2010 Suicide also played a show with Michael Monroe in August 2010 at Ankkarock Festival replacing Steve Conte who had to cancel due to family reasons."@en ;

Nelson Gon\u00E7alves had a very productive collaboration with lyricist Adelino Moreira and recorded numerous successful albums. One of the great crooners of the day, he gained an international following and appeared at venues such as Radio City Music Hall in New York City. Nelson sold more than 62 million albums around the globe and is the second best-selling Brazilian artist of all time, behind Roberto Carlos (77 million). His personal life was sometimes filled with turmoil and at one time, a cocaine addiction almost destroyed his career. Having an outstanding singing voice, he was known to suffer from severe stuttering in his regular speech. Nelson Gon\u00E7alves died of a heart attack at the age of 79.

Two more albums for Epic, 1992's From the Heart and 1994's More Love, are each certified gold. Stone moved to Columbia Records to record Faith in Me, Faith in You, which did not produce a Top Ten among its three singles. After suffering a heart attack and stroke in the late 1990s, he exited the label and did not release another album until Make Up in Love in 1999 on Atlantic Records. The Long Way was released in 2002 on the Audium label (now part of E1 Music), followed by two albums on the independent Lofton Creek Records. Stone has charted twenty-two singles on Hot Country Songs, with his greatest chart success coming between 1990 and 1995. In this timespan, he charted four number 1 singles: \"In a Different Light\", \"A Jukebox with a Country Song\", \"Too Busy Being in Love\", and \"Why Didn't I Think of That\", plus eleven more top ten singles.

	dbo:abstract	"Emilie Autumn Liddell (born on September 22, 1979), better known by her stage name Emilie Autumn, is an American singer-songwriter, poet, violinist, and actress. Autumn's musical style has been described by her as \"Fairy Pop\", \"Fantasy Rock\" or \"Victoriandustrial\". It is influenced by glam rock\u2014from plays, novels, and history, particularly the Victorian era. Performing with her all-female backup dancers The Bloody Crumpets, Autumn incorporates elements of classical music, cabaret, electronica, and glam rock with theatrics, and burlesque. Growing up in Malibu, California, she began learning the violin at the age of four and left regular school five years later with the goal of becoming a world-class violinist; she practiced eight or nine hours a day and read a wide range of literature. Progressing to writing her own music, she studied under various teachers and went to Indiana University, which she left over issues regarding the relationship between classical music and the appearance of the performer. Through her own independent label Traitor Records, Autumn debuted with her classical album On a Day: Music for Violin & Continuo, followed by the release in 2003 of her album Enchant. She appeared in singer Courtney Love's backing band on her 2004 America's Sweetheart tour and returned to Europe. She released the 2006 album Opheliac with the German label Trisol Music Group. In 2007, she released Laced/Unlaced; the re-release of On a Day... appeared as Laced with songs on the electric violin as Unlaced. She later left Trisol to join New-York-based The End Records in 2009 and release Opheliac in the United States, where previously it had only been available as an import. In 2012, she released the album Fight Like a Girl. She played the role of Painted Doll in Darren Lynn Bousman's 2012 film The Devil's Carnival, as well as its 2015 sequel, Alleluia! The Devil's Carnival."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Pete Sandoval (born May 21, 1963) is a Salvadoran-born American death metal drummer. He plays Sabian cymbals and Evans heads. His first significant stint as a drummer was for the grindcore band Terrorizer, formed in 1986, where he began to demonstrate some of his talent. Heavily influenced by the grindcore music around him, Sandoval quickly developed his abilities as a drummer with little formal training or musical education. In 1988, Sandoval was invited to join the death metal band Morbid Angel. Concurrently, the original lineup of Terrorizer was dissolved after the departures of Sandoval and guitarist Jesse Pintado (who subsequently joined Napalm Death). Sandoval had never used two bass drums before joining Morbid Angel. He had to practice frequently in order to get his feet up to speed, and recorded the Altars of Madness album within only a couple of months of joining Morbid Angel. According to Morbid Angel guitarist Trey Azagthoth, the band would occasionally walk in on Sandoval passed out on the floor in a pool of sweat. After being woken up, he would immediately say, \"Time to get back to work!\" After mastering double-bass usage in Morbid Angel, Sandoval also implemented them in Terrorizer's World Downfall album when the band briefly re-united to record it. According to former singer David Vincent, the band once played a prank on Sandoval by making him listen to a band that used a preprogrammed drum machine, and pretended it was a real drummer who could play faster than he could. Sandoval was gutted, and went on to practice until he managed to play faster than the machine. In 2010, he had to undergo surgery to repair a prolapsed disc. Not being able to play painlessly for an extended period for up to a year, he was replaced by Tim Yeung for the recording and touring of Morbid Angel's 2011 album Illud Divinum Insanus. In December of 2013, David Vincent stated in an interview that Sandoval was no longer with Morbid Angel, citing incompatibility with the band after Sandoval's conversion to Christianity as the reason."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Erik Keith Brann (born Rick Davis; August 11, 1950 \u2013 July 25, 2003), also known as Erik Braunn, was an American guitarist with the 1960s acid rock band Iron Butterfly. He is featured on the band's greatest hit, the 17-minute In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida (1968), recorded when he was 17. A Boston, Massachusetts native and a violinist, Brann was accepted as a child into the prodigy program at the Boston Symphony Orchestra, but was soon lured away to become a rock guitarist, joining Iron Butterfly at 16. He played with Ron Bushy, Lee Dorman and Doug Ingle from 1968 to 1969. The first album from this lineup, In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida, sold over 30 million copies, was awarded the first platinum award and stayed on the Billboard magazine charts for nearly three years. With arrangement assistance from Dorman, Brann wrote the song \"Termination\", which was featured on the album. The album's mini-bio, written when he was 17, tells of an acting ambition he once had, clothing and food preference and the ease with which rock 'n roll artists were able to arrange sexual encounters (usually with groupies). It reads: \"Although music has always been his one great love, Erik studied drama and before joining the Butterfly, his acting ability had landed him the lead role in a local play. ...Erik hopes to, one day, continue in the acting field. Right now, however, his only concern is the Iron Butterfly, turtleneck sweaters, bananas and the fairer sex.\" In 1970, Brann and former Iron Butterfly member Darryl DeLoach, formed Flintwhistle. This band performed live for about a year before breaking up. Between 1972 and 1973, Brann worked solely in the studio on various demos. In 1973, he recorded a couple demos with MCA Records which can be found on bootleg sites. Notable songs from these demos include early versions of \"Hard Miseree\", \"Am I Down\", and \"Scorching Beauty\". In 1974, he reunited with Ron Bushy to form a new version of Iron Butterfly. The 1975 LP Scorching Beauty featured Brann on guitars and vocals, Bushy on drums, Philip Taylor Kramer on bass and Howard Reitzes on keyboards. The band released Sun and Steel in late 1975 with Bill DeMartines replacing Reitzes on keyboards. Neither album sold well, and the band disbanded shortly afterward (around summer 1977). Brann occasionally reunited with Iron Butterfly for concerts, and was working on his solo debut when he died of a heart attack on July 25, 2003, in Los Angeles. This followed an ongoing struggle with complications from a birth defect that Brann had battled for years."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Erin McKeown (pronounced \"mick-YONE\") is an American multi-instrumentalist and folk-rock singer/songwriter. McKeown began her career in the folk scene. She released her first album, Monday Morning Cold in 1999, on her own label (TVP Records), travelling throughout New England while still a student at Brown University in order to promote the record. Although she had begun studying ornithology, she graduated from Brown with a degree in ethnomusicology. McKeown's music is difficult to categorize in terms of genre; it has touched upon pop, swing, rock, folk, and electronic music, as well as many other genres. McKeown cites The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy as an influence on her music. \"Her operative mood is effortless grace\" - LA Weekly \"Her set had an exquisitely open airiness, rich and pastoral for being so stripped down.\" - Philadelphia Inquirer \"That's McKeown\u2019s genius: her ability to take what is, twist it into something more relevant and maintain whatever it is about the music that makes it work. Smarter pop? Seductive commentary? REALLY? Yes.\" - Paste Magazine \"In several distinctive ways- voice, dynamic subtlety, and sheer songwriting ability- Erin McKeown is in a class of her own.\" - Sunday Times (UK) \"Her playing is so muscular, her arrangements so well conceived that she succeeds brilliantly. As with all truly great guitarists, the wonder is less in her chops than her choices.\" - Boston Globe \"Her clear mezzo-soprano sounds perpetually optimistic, and so do the syncopated electric guitar parts she picks and plucks through the sparsely arranged but fully realized songs. A degree in ethnomusicology, and African undercurrents, separate her from more rhythmically earth-bound folk-rockers.\" - Jon Pareles, New York Times for \"We Will Become Like Birds\" (2005) \"Her voice slips into the territory of Florence Welch and Elena Tonra with its depth and texture, but stands alone in its complete clarity, a dinner bell ringing through a drafty home until the whole place is warm. She is, more simply, the kind of artist who will give you a varied, confetti-colored pocketful of secrets in return for a smile and some applause. She is easy listening without anything inherently easy about it.\" - New Haven Independent McKeown continues to perform regularly, spending much of her time touring throughout the world with artists such as Ani DiFranco, Josh Ritter, the Indigo Girls, Martin Sexton, Andrew Bird, Thea Gilmore, Melissa Ferrick, Allison Miller, and others. McKeown also took part in Queerstock, a music festival dedicated to promoting LGBT musicians. Early in her career, she also collaborated with Beth Amsel, Jess Klein, and Rose Polenzani; the four of them performed as Voices on the Verge. McKeown's 2005 album, We Will Become Like Birds (produced by Tucker Martine), served as a departure from her earlier work, with a more rock-oriented sound. At a September 1, 2008, concert at The Gravity Lounge in Charlottesville, Virginia, McKeown told the audience that she wrote this album \"in an attempt to write myself out of the worst heartache I'd experienced up to that point.\" Her next studio release, Sing You Sinners, was released in Europe on the 23 October 2006 and in the United States on January 9, 2007 by Nettwerk Records LLC. It consists mostly of covers of jazz standards from the 1920s through 1950s. McKeown's record, Hundreds of Lions, was released under Righteous Babe Records on October 13, 2009. Additionally, a series of web concerts recorded in 2009 are available at McKeown's website. McKeown is also currently member of an unsigned band known as \"emma\", which she created with her friend Allison Miller. McKeown has plans to write a book of poetry. McKeown released \"Manifestra\" on January 15, 2013. Physical copies also came with a bonus album, \"Civics\", where Erin performed the entirety of \"Manifestra\" solo acoustic in a historic library. McKeown is noted for her energetic stage presence and her habit of wearing tailored suits, often with ties and Fluevog shoes, to performances. She grew up in Fredericksburg, Virginia, and now lives in Massachusetts. She occasionally performs big band music with the Beantown Swing Orchestra. McKeown was selected to be a 2011-2012 fellow at Harvard University's Berkman Center for Internet & Society. There, she will \"work to connect the worlds of policy, art, and technology while considering questions about how to make a creative life a viable vocation.\""@en .

He got his big break when he became a producer for Dr. Dre's newly founded record label Aftermath Entertainment, and then went on to work with Snoop Dogg's record label Dogghouse Records (now Doggystyle Records) and became a known producer on Tha Dogg Pound-affiliated material. He has produced tracks from Kurupt's Tha Streetz Iz a Mutha and most of his next release, Space Boogie: Smoke Oddessey; both released during the period the rapper had left Death Row. He has also produced for other hip hop and pop artists such as Britney Spears, Kurupt, Eminem, Ice Cube, Westside Connection, Lil' Kim, Hilary Duff, Xzibit, The Game, Nate Dogg, Everlast, Cypress Hill, 50 Cent, Mobb Deep, and The Doors, as well as non-US acts such as Dizzie Rascal, Tamer Hosney, Qusai and Karl Wolf."@en .

He is a session musician for various other bands, including George Lynch's Souls of We. He is also an ex-member of the French power metal band Heavenly and played several shows with Carnival in Coal in 2006. According to his profile on Dragonforce.com, Leclercq can speak \"French, English, German, and some dirty words in almost every language,\" and his signature stage move is \"Black metal whiskey sculling.\" He was asked by Herman Li to help DragonForce on a few shows in North America and Japan as they needed a bassist. At first, he was only supposed to play on a sessional basis, but he played with so much skill and professionalism that he was offered the position permanently. He has since gone on to become a creative force in DragonForce, writing and co-writing music and lyrics for the band since 2012's The Power Within. Leclercq played sessional rhythm guitar for Swedish power metal band Sabaton on their European tour in 2011, as regular guitarist Rikard Sund\u00E9n had just become a father. After years in the making, Leclercq's project Sinsaenum is finally announced in 2016."@en ;

Along with The Trinity, she was featured prominently in the 1969 television special 33 1/3 Revolutions Per Monkee, singing \"I'm a Believer\" in a soul style with Micky Dolenz. She and Auger had previously worked in Steampacket, with Long John Baldry and Rod Stewart. \"This Wheel's on Fire\" reached number five in the United Kingdom in June 1968. With distortion, the imagery of the title and the group's dress and performance, this version came to represent the psychedelic era in British rock music. Driscoll recorded the song again in the early 1990s with Adrian Edmondson as the theme to the BBC comedy series Absolutely Fabulous, the main characters of which are throwbacks to that era. Since the 1970s, Driscoll has concentrated on experimental vocal music. She married jazz musician Keith Tippett and collaborated with him and now uses the name Julie Tippetts, adopting the original spelling of her husband's surname. She took in Keith Tippett's big band Centipede and in 1974 sang in Robert Wyatt's Theatre Royal Drury Lane concert. She released a solo album, Sunset Glow in 1975; and was lead vocalist on Carla Bley's album Tropic Appetitesand also in John Wolf Brennan's \"HeXtet\". Later in the 1970s, she toured with her own band and recorded and performed as one of the vocal quartet Voice, with Maggie Nichols, Phil Minton, and Brian Eley. In the early 1980s, Julie Tippetts was a guest vocalist on an early single by pop-jazz band Working Week, on the song \"Storm of Light\", which brought them to the attention of a wider audience."@en ;

Ljova is the author of over 70 original compositions for classical, jazz, and folk music ensembles. He has also contributed musical scores to numerous short and feature films. Among recent projects is a commission from the City of London Sinfonia, a string quartet for Brooklyn Rider and a commission for Yo-Yo Ma and the Silk Road Project; arrangements for the Brooklyn Philharmonic, tenor Javier Camarena, conductor Alondra de la Parra, the Mexican songwriter Natalia Lafourcade, composer/guitarist Gustavo Santaolalla, The Knights, and collaborations with choreographers Aszure Barton, Damian Woetzel, Christopher Wheeldon and Eduardo Vilaro (with Ballet Hispanico). Ljova immigrated to the United States and has lived on the Upper West Side of New York City since 1990. He is the son of one of Russia's foremost composers, Alexander Zhurbin, and the poet/lyricist/writer Irena Ginzburg. Ljova released his debut solo CD, Vjola: World on Four Strings, in July 2006 on his own label, Kapustnik Records. \"Mnemosyne\", the debut album of his ensemble, Ljova and the Kontraband, featured Frank London, William Schimmel and other special guests. His third album, \"Lost in Kino\", focuses on his film music, featuring Ljova's cues from collaborations with films by Francis Ford Coppola, James Marsh, Robin Hessman, Josef Astor, Lev Polyakov, Roman Khrushch, Sean Gannet and Basia Winograd. In 2012, Ljova released his fourth album, \"Melting River\", featuring music created for a dance piece by choreographer Aszure Barton. It was initially released as a download-exclusive on Bandcamp, but has since been issued on limited edition vinyl with bonus tracks. His latest release is \"No Refund on Flowers\", the second album by Ljova and the Kontraband, crowdfunded through a 34-second campaign on Kickstarter. Ljova is married to Inna Barmash, an attorney and musician. They have two sons, Benjamin (born 2009) and Yosif (born 2011)."@en ;
