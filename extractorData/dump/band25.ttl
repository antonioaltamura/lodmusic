	dbo:abstract	"Humanimal was a musical project featuring Pontus Norgren (Great King Rat) and Marcel Jacob (Talisman). The band's name idea come from Marcel Jacob who used the following quote: \"...we might be human but in the end, we still being animals\". The main idea was to have a hard rock record with three singers: Leif Sundin (Great King Rat, John Norum, Michael Schenker Group), Jeff Scott Soto (Talisman, ex-Yngwie Malmsteen) and Mats Lev\u00E9n (Krux, At Vance, ex-Yngwie Malmsteen). After some research and testing, they decided to go with one singer, because they also thought it would be easier for the listeners if they only used one, and well they chose Jeff Scott Soto. After that, again Norgren and Jacob were thinking about who could be the best drummer that they should use for that kind of musical project and they chose Tomas Broman (Great King Rat, Electric Boys, Amaze Me, Hughes Turner Project, Glenn Hughes). They released their only record on January 28, 2002 in USA and February 1 in Europe, but by popular demand the record label made a second edition to reach at least three European countries. Also on June 17, 2002, the record label released a 3-track EP called \"Find My Way Home\". In May the band played a couple of shows to support it. Unfortunately, this was not a good moment for the guys owing to some personal, professional and legal problems. Pontus and Marcel had a falling-out and this meant that Pontus was out both of Talisman and Humanimal, then on October 19 of that year, Humanimal split."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Kill II This (sometimes typeset as Kill 2 This) are a Metal band from Manchester, England. KILL II THIS blend extreme metal music with elements of industrial electronica, hip-hop and even opera. Terrorizer magazine summed it up by saying, \"Their sound crosses clever industrial style sampling with fearsome guitar. Kill II This have created a beast which is threatening yet danceable.\" They experienced the highs of critical acclaim and prestigious tours. They also had to deal with forced line up changes, which from time to time tested the band's resolve. But with guitarist Mark Mynett at the helm they carried on regardless, creating one innovative album after another. The first album, \"Another Cross II Bare,\" was released in 1997 and featured Jeff Singer (drums), Pete Stone (Bass) and Nick Arlea (vocals). KILL II THIS supported GRIP INC. and SKINLAB for some UK dates in June 1997 then MEGADETH on their \"Cryptic Writings\" European tour. In 1998 the second album, \"Deviate,\" was released to huge praise from press and fans alike. Matt Pollock and Caroline Campbell were recruited for vocal and bass duties, while Ben Calvert replaced Jeff Singer on drums for touring duties after the album had been recorded. Metal Hammer's review said, \"Here is an album brimming with deflowered gems; downbeat riffs that don't depress and confident grooves.\" 2000 saw KILL II THIS out on a British tour supported by EARTHTONE 9 and LINEA 77. The band's third effort, \"Trinity,\" featured FEAR FACTORY frontman Burton C. Bell guesting on the cover of FRANKIE GOES TO HOLLYWOOD's \"Two Tribes.\" The band was confirmed as support to the GODFLESH and DEVIN TOWNSEND package tour of Britain during December 2001. They would also open for SOIL's UK debut gig in January 2002. Kerrang! said, \" Kill II This set about putting the last 20 years of heavy guitar music into a blender, and arrive at a sound that puts them out as one of THE most cutting edge bands around.\" The fourth album, 2003's 'Mass.[Down.]-Sin.(Drone) was recorded with vocalist Phil Bretnall and drummer Steve Rooney. Pete Stone returned on bass. European tours with Anthrax, Fear Factory, Type O Negative, Slipknot and Machine Head followed as well as a headline European tour with Area 54 as support. In the Spring of 2004 Mark Mynett revealed that the fifth KILL II THIS album would be the band's last. However, plans for the swan song KILL II THIS outing took on a new direction when the record, entitled, \"A New Spiritual Mountain,\" was released under the brand new band name CITY OF GOD. This new outfit comprised Jeff Singer, fresh from his stints with PARADISE LOST and BLAZE, Simon Gordon, ex-XENTRIX / Hellfighter, and Tim Preston, ex-DEARLY BEHEADED. The band didn't tour in support of this album and it seemed KILL II THIS had indeed come to an end. Mark Mynett is now a Senior Lecturer in Music Technology & Production at the University of Huddersfield and currently resides in Manchester, England. Mynett has recently had the cover feature published in November 2009's issue of Sound on Sound magazine where he discusses 'Extreme Metal Production'. Mynett still actively produces albums from his studio in Huddersfield, England."@en ;

The Chorale consists of trained volunteer musicians from the greater New York City area and seeks to broaden public interest in fine choral music by performing a full range of musical styles at the highest quality. Audience members have commended the warmth and body of the chorale\u2019s tone, and a concert review in Soundview News praised its \u201Cpoignant elegance.\u201D Since its premiere at Lincoln Center\u2019s Alice Tully Hall in 2006, the Chorale has expanded its artistic influence, performing two concerts in its most recent season. To date, the New York City Master Chorale has performed at a variety of venues, including Carnegie Hall, Lincoln Center's Avery Fisher Hall, Riverside Church, Church of St. Paul the Apostle and Symphony Space, and has collaborated with both the Park Avenue Symphony and the Astoria Symphony. Recent repertoire has included Beethoven\u2019s Ninth Symphony, the Mozart Requiem, Rachmaninoff\u2019s Vespers, the Faur\u00E9 Requiem, Leonard Bernstein\u2019s Chichester Psalms and Morten Lauridsen\u2019s Lux \u00C6terna, along with choral works by American composers including Aaron Copland, Samuel Barber and Randall Thompson, and spirituals by Moses Hogan. During the 2008\u20132009 season, the Chorale premiered a new American work for chorus, orchestra and narrator at Lincoln Center. The Journey, composed by Aaron Fruchtman, tells the tale of pioneers moving west on the Oregon Trail. The performance was narrated by Academy Award nominee Bruce Dern. During the 2009 - 2010 season, the Chorale presented the Durufl\u00E9 Requiem. They also collaborated with the Rock Creek Singers of the Gay Men's Chorus of Washington DC to present the Durufl\u00E9 Messe Cum Jubilo. The 2010 - 2011 season was the Chorale's Fifth Anniversary season, during which the Chorale had its European debut, performing the European premiere of Paul Leavitt: Requime at \u00C9glise Saint-Sulpice. The Chorale also performed at St. Patrick's Cathedral in December 2010. The New York City Master Chorale also has a commitment to providing outreach to New York City\u2019s public schools and community. In addition to engaging community members through its regular concerts, Dr. Kano and the singers visit low-income public schools, exposing more than 400 students per year to choral music. These classroom lessons include conversations with students about the value and role of classical music and providing them with complimentary tickets to the chorale\u2019s concerts. The majority of the students who partake in the program and who attend the concerts have had little to no exposure to classical music. Additionally, the Chorale performs free concerts at area churches to bring the experience of classical music to local communities. NYCMC is the only New York City area chorus with such outreach programs in its schools and community."@en ;

During an interview on college radio station WHOV in 1987, Parrish Smith stated that the name evolved from the original: \"We were originally known as \"EEPMD\" (Easy Erick and Parrish the Microphone Doctor), but chose to go with EPMD because it was easier to say.\" He also stated that they dropped the two \"E's\" because N.W.A.'s Eric Wright was already using \"Eazy-E\" as his stage name. The group has been active for 31 years (minus two breakups in 1993 and 1999), and is one of the most prominent acts in east coast hip hop. Diamond J and DJ K La Boss were DJs for the group and their current DJ is DJ Scratch The word \"business\" is used in every title of the group's albums.

Among other periodicals, they have been featured in Rolling Stone Magazine, CMJ, and The Cincinnati Post. The Ass Ponys went on hiatus in 2005, after releasing the compilation album The Okra Years - 4 years after their last original material was released in Lohio. More importantly, it appears that core band members are focused on new projects, so new Ass Ponys output seems unlikely any time soon. Vocalist Chuck Cleaver is focusing his attention on a new band, Wussy. Bill Alletzhauser currently fronts the band The Hiders. Randy Cheek plays with The Libertines US, The Fairmount Girls and The Ready Stance. Chuck Cleaver and Randy Cheek performed together at TedxCincinnati in November 2013.

Later, they added keyboardist Ben Ryderman and bassist Tommy Kende. Gates, who also performs with the comedy group Tripod, has been writing and performing his own original music since the age of sixteen. Before Kind of Pluto, Gates refined his songwriting skills by performing solo acoustic spots all over Australia. In 1999, he took his songs as far as New York City and Philadelphia. Gates decided to create an acoustic duo with friend and drummer Simm Thom. Kind of Pluto's first EP was launched on 19 October 2001 at Melbourne's 9th Ward. Kind of Pluto received nationwide airplay with their first release, a self-titled EP described by Time Off Magazine as \"brilliantly warm, fresh and ethereal. Absolutely shines with inspiration.\" The EP's first track, Familiar, was given strong rotation on the Triple J network. A 'Live at the Wireless' session for Richard Kingsmill's Oz Music Show brought them much attention from listeners and record companies alike. \"Everyone's A Pornstar\" was played on the Triple J network as well. The band was also been chosen by Nova 100 as Melbourne Band of the Week and enjoyed extensive radio play with Sleepwalker. Other radio stations to support Kind of Pluto include Triple R and PBS. Since early 2005, the band has been on an extended hiatus - perhaps never to return - with Ben Rynderman departing the group at the end of 2004."@en ;

The group, also known as The I.N.C., included Eyceurokk (Eyce, Uneek and Rokkdiesel), Lord Digga, Paula Perry and R&B vocalist Leschea. Ace first gained notice in the rap world as a member of the legendary Juice Crew, and with the release of his acclaimed 1990 debut Take a Look Around, which featured an appearance from Eyceurokk. In 1992, Ace formed the I.N.C. crew and recorded their first group album, SlaughtaHouse, which was released in May 1993. Ace provided almost all of the rapping, with Lord Digga serving as the hype-man. Digga was also responsible for a bulk of the beats, producing five of the album's songs as part of the duo Bluez Brothers. Paula Perry was the main performer on the song \"Who U Jackin'?\", Leschea provided vocals for \"Don't Fuck Around (Outro)\", and Eyceurokk appeared on the tracks '\"Slaughtahouse\"' (as MC Negro), \"Ain't U Da Masta\" and \"Saturday Nite Live\". The album was highly acclaimed, but sold only moderately well. Some versions of SlaughtaHouse included the hidden bonus track, \"Born to Roll\", which became a huge hit in 1994, breaking into the Top 25 on the Billboard Hot 100 singles chart. Eyceurokk split from the crew after SlaughtaHouse, leaving the group to four members. In 1995, the crew released their second album, Sittin' On Chrome, which featured \"Born to Roll\", as well as two more Hot 100 hit singles, \"The I.N.C. Ride\" and \"Sittin' on Chrome\". The album, produced by Ace, Bluez Bruthas (Lord Digga and Witch Doctor), Uneek and Louie Vega, featured a sound Ace called \"Brooklyn Bass Music\". The album was also highly acclaimed, and sold better than SlaughtaHouse, but still wasn't able to push a strong amount of units. The crew split up in 1996, after Ace began having personal conflicts with Lord Digga and Paula Perry. Ace was largely missing from the scene until 2001, when he returned with his acclaimed solo album Disposable Arts. According to a 2006 interview on Prince Paul's XM Radio show, Ace stated that he and Lord Digga are finally speaking again, but Ace has yet to collaborate with either Digga or Paula Perry since the crew's break-up. However, he did work with Leschea on \"Type I Hate\" from his 2001 album, Disposable Arts and \"Bklyn Masala\" from his 2004 album, A Long Hot Summer."@en ;

The quartet was one of the Soviet Union's best known in the West during the Cold War era, through concert performances in the United States and Europe and through distribution of their recordings. The quartet had a close relationship with composer Dmitri Shostakovich, who personally consulted them on each of his quartets. They also performed with the pianist Sviatoslav Richter on many occasions. They have recorded all of Shostakovich's string quartets as well as all of Beethoven's quartets. Their many recordings include works by a wide range of composers on the Melodiya, Teldec, Virgin Records, and Chandos Records labels. The original Borodin quartet's sound was characterised by an almost symphonic volume and a highly developed ability to phrase whilst maintaining group cohesion. Although it has seen many changes in personnel over its life span, all members of the quartet have been graduates of the Moscow Conservatory."@en ;

In May of the same year, Dispatch released an EP containing six new songs, their first all-new release since 2000. The band released both their first studio album in over a decade, Circles Around the Sun, and an iTunes session in 2012 and toured North America that summer in support of the album.

The band's debut studio album, Lungs, was released on 6 July 2009, and held the number-two position for its first five weeks on the UK Albums Chart. On 17 January 2010, the album reached the top position, after being on the chart for twenty-eight consecutive weeks. As of October 2010, the album had been in the top forty in the United Kingdom for sixty-five consecutive weeks, making it one of the best-selling albums of 2009 and 2010.

The band began by recording and releasing multiple singles from 2002 to 2004 leading up to their eponymous debut studio album, which was released in 2005. It garnered critical acclaim as well as a Grammy nomination for Best Electronic/Dance Album. Their single \"Daft Punk Is Playing at My House\", which has become the band's most successful single, also received a Grammy nomination for Best Dance Recording. In the following year, LCD Soundsystem recorded and released \"45:33\", a forty-six minute-long composition that was made as a \"workout track\" especially for Nike as part of their Nike+ Original Run series. In 2007, the band released their second studio album, Sound of Silver, to critical acclaim and another Grammy nomination for Best Electronic/Dance Album. Three years later, LCD Soundsystem released their third studio album, This Is Happening, which became their first top-ten album in their home country of the United States. In February 2011, a statement was posted on the band's website that announced its disbandment. It was to be made official following a large farewell concert at Madison Square Garden on April 2, 2011. The farewell concert is chronicled in the documentary film Shut Up and Play the Hits and was also made available as a live album, titled The Long Goodbye, in April 2014. After a series of rumors hinting at a possible band reunion, LCD Soundsystem released the single \"Christmas Will Break Your Heart\" in December 2015, making it their first single in five years. LCD Soundsystem later confirmed their reunion and announced an expanded tour, including appearances at several high-profile music festivals, as well as a new studio album, which will be released in either 2016 or 2017."@en ;

Although the band is Canadian, Haines was born in India and Winstead is American. The band started in 1998 as a duo formed by Haines and Shaw with the name \"Mainstream\". After releasing an EP titled Mainstream EP, they changed the band's name to Metric, after a sound that was programmed by Shaw on his keyboard. In 2001, Winstead and Scott-Key joined them. The band's first official studio album, Old World Underground, Where Are You Now?, was released on September 2, 2003. It was followed by the album Live It Out, released on October 4, 2005, which was nominated for the 2006 Polaris Music Prize for the \"Canadian Album of the Year\" and for the 2006 Juno Awards for \"Best Alternative Album\". Their third studio album, Grow Up and Blow Away, was recorded in 2001 and it was initially planned as their debut album. The album was delayed for many years and it was finally released on June 26, 2007, with some changes to the track list. Some songs were also slightly reworked. Metric's fourth album Fantasies was released on April 7, 2009. It was shortlisted for the 2009 Polaris Music Prize for \"Canadian Album of the Year\", and won the \"Alternative Album of the Year\" at the 2010 Juno Awards. Metric also won the 2010 \"Group of the Year\". The fifth Metric studio album, Synthetica, was released on June 12, 2012.

	dbo:abstract	"Ministry is an American industrial metal band founded by lead singer and only original member Al Jourgensen in 1981. Originally a new wave synthpop outfit, Ministry changed its style to become one of the pioneers of industrial metal in the mid-1980s. Ministry found mainstream success in the early 1990s with their fifth studio album Psalm 69: The Way to Succeed and the Way to Suck Eggs (1992) and touring as part of the Lollapalooza festival. After 27 years of performing, Jourgensen decided to end the band in 2008, saying a reunion would never happen. However, in August 2011, a reunion was announced, when Ministry confirmed they would play one of their first shows in four years at the Wacken Open Air festival in August 2012. Ministry released a new album, Relapse, on March 23, 2012, which was followed by a world tour. Following the death of long time guitarist Mike Scaccia, Ministry released their most recent studio album From Beer to Eternity in September 2013, and subsequently began to tour again with new guitarist Cesar Soto."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Misfits are an American horror punk band often recognized as the progenitors of the horror punk subgenre, blending punk rock and other musical influences with horror film themes and imagery. Founded in 1977 in Lodi, New Jersey the original lineup consisted of singer and songwriter Glenn Danzig, bassist Jerry Only, and drummer Manny Mart\u00EDnez. Danzig and Only were the only consistent members throughout the next six years. During this time they released several EPs and singles, and with Only's brother Doyle as guitarist, the albums Walk Among Us (1982) and Earth A.D./Wolfs Blood (1983), both considered touchstones of the early-1980s hardcore punk movement. Misfits disbanded in 1983 and Danzig went on to form Samhain and then the eponymous Danzig. Several albums of reissued and previously unreleased material were issued after the group's dissolution, and their music became influential to punk rock, heavy metal, and alternative rock music of the late 1990s and early 2000s. After a series of legal battles with Danzig, Only and Doyle regained the rights to record and perform as the Misfits. They formed a new version of the band in 1995 with singer Michale Graves and drummer Dr. Chud. This incarnation of Misfits had a sound much more rooted in heavy metal, and released the albums American Psycho (1997) and Famous Monsters (1999) before dissolving in 2000. Jerry Only then took over lead vocals and recruited former Black Flag guitarist Dez Cadena and former Ramones drummer Marky Ramone for a Misfits 25th Anniversary tour. This lineup released an album of cover songs entitled Project 1950 and toured for several years. In 2005 Ramone was replaced by Robo, who had played with Black Flag in the early 1980s and had also previously been Misfits' drummer from 1982 to 1983. This lineup released a single titled \"Land of the Dead\" in 2009. The Misfits' lineup of Only, Cadena, and drummer Eric \"Chupacabra\" Arce released a new album titled The Devil's Rain in October 2011. In 2015 it was announced that Cadena would be taking a break from music after receiving a cancer diagnosis, and was replaced by Only's son Jerry Caiafa II. That same year Soulfly's Marc Rizzo joined the band, also playing guitar, filling in for Cadena before Caiafa would move on to become the sole guitarist for the band. In September 2016, for the first time in 33 years, Danzig, Only and Doyle reunited for two headlining shows at the Riot Fest, along with original Slayer drummer Dave Lombardo and second guitarist Acey Slade."@en ;

The band's line-up consisted of vocalist and guitarist Justin Pierre, lead guitarist Joshua Cain, keyboardist Jesse Johnson, bassist Matthew Taylor, and drummer Tony Thaxton. Over the course of their nearly twenty-year career, the group toured heavily and released six studio albums, the majority on independent label Epitaph Records. The band's sound, at times described as pop punk or emo, made notable use of the Moog synthesizer. The group was formed in 1997 by Cain and Pierre, but it was not until 2002 that the group had formed a stable lineup, at which point they began recording music. The band signed to Epitaph in 2003, which released the band's debut album, I Am the Movie. Their breakthrough album, Commit This to Memory, arrived in 2005, and their third record, Even If It Kills Me (2007), also achieved commercial success. The band briefly signed to major label Columbia for their fourth record, My Dinosaur Life (2010), and rejoined Epitaph for Go in 2012, after which Thaxton left the group and was replaced by Claudio Rivera. Their final album Panic Stations was released in 2015. In 2016, the band announced their split and the So Long, Farewell tour, for which Thaxton rejoined the band."@en ;
