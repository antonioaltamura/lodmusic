	dbo:abstract	"Lefty is the seventh solo album by Art Garfunkel, released in 1988. The album features three songs by singer-songwriter Stephen Bishop. The album's cover photo shows a pre-teen Art Garfunkel holding a baseball bat in the front yard of his childhood home in the Forest Hills section of Queens, New York City. It was taken by his brother Jules. The album title came from the fact that Garfunkel is left-handed, which the picture established. The album failed to make the Top 100 in the US and hit the bottom half of the UK Top 100. Despite this, it yielded three minor hit singles. The liner notes of the album contain a brief prose text Garfunkel had written in memory of his partner Laurie Bird who had committed suicide in 1979. The album marked a new beginning in Garfunkel's professional life after becoming somewhat of a recluse following the tragedy."@en ;

Simone was in her mid-20s at the time, and still aspiring to be a classical concert pianist. She immediately sold the rights for the songs on this album to Bethlehem for $3,000, with the deal eventually costing her royalty profits of more than a million dollars. Simone was dissatisfied by the lack of effort the record company took in promoting her, and after this album she formed a long business relationship with Colpix Records. The album Nina Simone and Her Friends was released after she had left Bethlehem, without her consent, and comprised songs that were left over from the Little Girl Blue recording session. The session was the only one ever recorded for Bethlehem. The original 1958 album was released in mono, but a second issue the following year, by Bethlehem Records (SBCP-6028), was stereo. It was also released in 2003, on the Charly label, as Jazz as Played in an Exclusive Side Street Club. The album was reissued by Bethlehem in 1992 on CD (Bethlehem 30042), with three additional tracks from the same session: \"He's Got the Whole World in His Hands\", \"For All We Know\" and \"African Mailman\"."@en ;

The tone of the album is more pop-oriented than any previous release featuring Schlitt. Most of the rock songs lack the driving edge of their previous albums, and the sonic field is no longer flooded with distorted guitars, leaning more toward a calculated, radio-friendly sound. All the guitars in the album were played by founder Bob Hartman. However, since he had quit touring with the band before the release of the album, new guitarist David Lichens was enlisted to travel with the band and appeared in the album art and promotional pictures. The album also featured another new member, keyboardist Jim Cooper. Cooper was a keyboard technician for former keyboardist John Lawry for several years. When Lawry retired, Cooper replaced him."@en ;

It would be their last album that would make an appearance on the chart until 1980s compilation Slade Smashes!. Musically, the album showed the band dropping their 'loud' and 'rocky' type songs, as they moved towards a more \"American\" soul/pop sound. British fans accused Noddy Holder and Jim Lea of \"selling out\" and forgetting about their fanbase in the UK, as the band had been in the States for most of 1975, trying to crack the market."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Norfolk Coast is the fifteenth album by The Stranglers, and was released on 16 February 2004. It was their first album in six years and their first studio album with new guitarist Baz Warne. A number of songs were written by Warne, including the ballad \"Dutch Moon\". Norfolk Coast peaked at No. 70 in the UK Albums Chart in February, for one week's duration in that listing. The album was well received by reviewers and fans alike, showing a return to form of the band. It also spawned the band's UK first Top 40 hit single for more than a decade, \"Big Thing Coming\" (No. 31 in February 2004 in the UK Singles Chart). The album saw the re-emergence of some of their signature sounds, such as Dave Greenfield's swirling keyboards, in a contemporary setting. The hard-edged title track sets the direction for much of the album, while there are more contemplative moments, such as the atmospheric \"Tuckers Grave\", dedicated to Edwin Tucker, who committed suicide in 1747 (and was written in the room in which he died). This was also the last album to feature Paul Roberts on lead vocals. Norfolk Coast was also the name of a short film starring Jean Jacques Burnel. It is available on the DVD On Stage On Screen and features rearranged music from the album.Directed by Robin Bextor and co-starring Susannah York the film won a number of awards."@en ;

In May 1998, the album had sold 500.000 copies worldwide, with 70.000 copies being sold in Denmark. The fourth single, \"I'm Gonna Be Around\" was re-produced by Per Magnusson and David Kreuger for its single release.

	dbo:abstract	"Puzzle (\u30D1\u30BA\u30EB Pazuru, KJ3 Puzzle) is the third full-length album released by the Japanese boyband Kanjani Eight. Puzzle was released almost two years after the release of their second album, KJ2 Zukkoke Dai Dass\u014D. There were two versions of this release, a regular edition and a CD+DVD limited edition. First press of the regular edition came with a photobook containing pictures from the making of the unit promotional videos, the normal edition came with member solos, and the limited edition CD+DVD came with a DVD documenting the making of the album, creation of the units, and music videos for each unit. The music's style is, again, unlike its predecessor. Out of all the albums released by the group, \"Puzzle\" is considerably the most \"modern\" sounding album of the bunch compared to KJ1 F.T.O which was primarily an 80s era pop sound and to KJ2 Zukkoke Dai Dassou's 70s era pop sound. The album is well diverse, with a blended balance of R&B, pop, rock, and slow ballads that present the group in a more mature, \"boyband\", sounding nature than their more notorious \"comedy\" sound. Jouya Uenaka of The Inazuma Sentai returned to write for the album, producing the group's biggest to date, \"Musekinin Hero\", as well as writing every rock song on the album. Kanjani Eight had a more creative control over the album, selecting from around 60 demos to sing for the album. Nishikido had personally requested Kazuyoshi Saito to write the title track of the album for the group. The member solos were all written and/or composed by the group themselves as well as for the special units for the album. The units themselves were picked out through a game of Jan Ken Pon during the night of their NTV Best Hit Artist 2008 performance."@en ;

The album took four years to record in total. The album has won a number of awards since its release, including the Grammy Award for Best Pop Vocal Album at the 51st annual ceremony (2009). Duffy also won three awards at the 2009 BRIT Awards for her work on Rockferry including Best British Album, whilst Butler was given the Producer's Award. It was a commercial success, reaching number-one in several music markets. It was the fourth best selling album of 2008 worldwide according to the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry and the highest of that year in the United Kingdom. In the UK the album was still in the top five a full year after its release, spending most of those weeks in the top ten albums, and a significant amount in the top three. In 2010, it was ranked the 22nd best-selling album of the 2000s in the UK. A total of five singles were released from the album. The first single, \"Rockferry\" had little impact, whilst the second and lead single internationally, \"Mercy\", was an international hit, topping over twelve music charts. It was the third-best-selling single of 2008 in the UK. Follow-up single \"Warwick Avenue\" was another successful single, whilst \"Stepping Stone\" and \"Rain on Your Parade\" did not replicate the earlier success. Rockferry was re-released as a deluxe edition on 24 November 2008 in the UK, preceded by the lead single \"Rain on Your Parade\" which became the fifth overall single from the album."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Shakira is the tenth studio album by Colombian singer Shakira, released on 21 March 2014 by RCA Records. It is her first English-language album since her eighth studio album, She Wolf (2009). Shakira revealed in November 2011 that she had begun work on the album, which continued into 2014. The album was initially set to be released in 2012, but was delayed because of Shakira's pregnancy. Since starting the album, Shakira departed Epic Records, signed a new management deal with Roc Nation and subsequently signed to Epic's sister label, RCA Records. A pop album, Shakira has a diverse musical style that incorporates a range of genres such as reggae and rock, as well as dance and country elements. Its production is characterized by lean, tender verses and muscular, ecstatic choruses, that incorporate swirling, crashing sounds. The album's lyrics explore motherhood, the complexities of romantic relationships, stages of love and the search for personal happiness. Most of the album was written by Shakira, along with Nasri and Adam Messinger, with all the previous predominantly producing the album. Upon release Shakira was met with positive reviews from music critics, praising its lyrical content, while others stated that Shakira was trying to \"Americanize her sound\". Commercially the album debuted at number two on the US Billboard 200 chart with first week sales of 85,000 copies. By doing so, Shakira became the singer's highest-charting album on the chart, although it also achieved her lowest first-week sales figure (for an English-language album). The album campaign started in 2014, with the release of its first single, \"Can't Remember to Forget You\", followed by the singles \"Empire\" and \"Dare (La La La)\"."@en ;

It was originally released in 1981 under the Elektra Records label but the rights to the album were later sold to Liberty Records. The album continued the crossover success established in the singer's two previous albums. Three singles were produced including the title track, which went to number one on country charts and reached the top 5 on both the Adult Contemporary and Billboard 100 charts. \"Someone Could Lose a Heart Tonight\" also reached number one on country charts and made the top 15 on the other two. \"I Don't Know Where to Start\" peaked at two and nine on the country and adult contemporary charts, respectively. Like Horizon, Step by Step reached number one on country album charts and ultimately achieved gold status. Allmusic gave the album 4.5 out of 5 stars."@en ;

Musically, it consists of more gritty blues-rock, following in the footsteps of their previous effort, Heartbreak Station. Due to a new MTV policy, the album was not mentioned at the channel. The record company barely promoted it in order to test different markets, a pattern that would continue all throughout the rest of the 1990s and 2000s. While Cinderella's first three albums all went platinum, the domination of grunge and alternative rock in the mid-1990s was so strong that it forced Still Climbing to chart at a lowly #178 and drop out after a mere few weeks, despite featuring the minor hits \"Bad Attitude Shuffle\" (which was released as a single), \"Hard to Find the Words\", and \"Hot & Bothered\" from Wayne's World. On a side note, the track \"Talk Is Cheap\" first appeared during a Cinderella show in 1987, though the version on this album is longer than the original, being slower in vocals."@en ;

The mostly Electronic album was a radical departure in style from the guitar-driven folk and rock for which he had become known. Themes on the album surround asking difficult questions of Christians on sexuality, race, and social justice. It was critically acclaimed and commercially successful, becoming Webb's first solo album to break into the Billboard Top 200 albums chart. The album generated controversy for its use of profanity (particularly the use of the word \"shit,\" in the context of a harsh spiritual object lesson in the song \"What Matters More\") and references to alcohol and sexuality, to the degree that it was originally refused by his record label. After an elaborate online scavenger hunt Webb staged for his fans to \"unlock\" the song for free distribution, his label conceded to releasing a \"clean version\" and an \"explicit version\" of the album, the latter of which was only available directly from Webb at his shows, or by ordering online."@en ;

The back cover of the album falsely claims that these recordings \"resulted in the birth of The Police.\" In fact, The Police had been active for months (with original guitarist Henry Padovani) before any of the recordings were made, save the \"Every Little Thing She Does Is Magic\" demo (which none of the Police aside from Sting had any involvement with). However, it was at these recording sessions where Sting and Copeland were first introduced to guitarist Andy Summers, who later replaced Padovani as the Police's guitarist, thus cementing the group's classic lineup. The Police would later re-record \"Visions of the Night\" and use parts of \"3 O'Clock Shit\" in two of their later compositions, \"Be My Girl\" and \"O My God\"."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"The Cost of Living is an EP by the English punk rock band The Clash. It was released on 11 May 1979 in a gatefold sleeve. The EP was produced by the band and Bill Price, it marked a transition in musical styles for the band, bridging the intensity of their earlier, punky albums with the broader, more American influenced rock and roll yet to come on London Calling, most evident on the folk rocking \"Groovy Times\" and \"Gates of the West\". The Clash's cover of Sonny Curtis' \"I Fought the Law\" became one of the definitive recordings of the song, and remained in the band's live set list for much of the rest of their career. Joe Strummer also performed it with his later bands, including during his stint with The Pogues. The early single \"Capital Radio\" was re-recorded because the band learned that copies of the original Capital Radio EP were selling for high prices. \"Capital Radio\", later listed as \"Capital Radio Two\", is much longer, mainly because of a protracted outro. Gates of the West clearly describes the ecstasy of The Clash in their first encounter with the United States - \"Eastside Jimmy & Southside Sue both said they needed something new\". \"From Camden Town Station to 44th & 8th\" describes their journey from their London neighborhood to the middle of Manhattan. It was recorded in Highbury, London, and features \"extra high vocal\" credited to Dennis Ferranti and harmonica credited to Bob Jones (in reality Mick Jones)."@en ;

The album reached #3 in the UK; overseas, it hit #4 in Canada on the RPM national Top Albums Chart and #18 in the US on the Billboard 200 in 1983. It went on to be certified platinum in the UK and Canada. It contains the song \"In a Big Country\" which is their only U.S. Top 40 hit single. The song featured heavily engineered guitar playing, strongly reminiscent of bagpipes; Adamson and fellow guitarist Watson achieved this through the use of the MXR Pitch Transposer 129 Guitar Effect. Also contributing to the band's unique sound was their use of the e-bow, a device which allows a guitar to sound more like strings or synthesizer. The album has been remastered and reissued on three occasions. The latest version released by Universal in 2012 in advance of the album's 30th anniversary includes a second disc of previously unissued demos. Also included in the set is a track produced by Chris Thomas from the first abortive attempt to record the band's debut album. The demos include the earliest recordings done by Adamson and Bruce Watson, some of which were recorded on four-track prior to recruiting either a drummer or bassist for the band. The set also includes a booklet with interviews (new in the case of the current band members and archived in the case of the late Stuart Adamson) by the journalist and author Tim Barr. Lyrics for all of the key songs are also included, and the album has been remastered by Paschal Byrne from the original master tapes. In total, ten previously unreleased tracks were included in the deluxe, digitally remastered edition."@en ;

The main exception is the track \"Thank You for the Music\", which, despite being written and recorded in 1977, was in fact released as a single (primarily in the UK) in 1983 after the band had split up. It appears on disc two, along with two bonus tracks, \"Ring Ring\" (1974 UK single remix), and \"Voulez-Vous\" (1979 US promo extended remix). The Australian version of The Definitive Collection adds a further two bonus tracks: \"Rock Me\" and \"Hasta Ma\u00F1ana\". The 1974 remix of \"Ring Ring\" is the first appearance on CD of this version mastered from the original master tape, after the UK single master tapes had been returned to Polar Music by the former UK licensees, Epic Records. The track's previous appearance on CD, in a 1999 singles boxed set, was mastered from a vinyl single. The Definitive Collection is the only ABBA compilation to include all the UK single releases from 1973 to 1983. The four \"unofficial\" UK ABBA singles are included, these being the 1974 remix of \"Ring Ring\", \"Angeleyes\", \"Lay All Your Love on Me\" and \"Thank You for the Music\". An \"unofficial single\" is one that was not released by ABBA's record label, Polar Music, in any Scandinavian country. The Definitive Collection replaced an old collection of ABBA's singles titled The Singles: The First Ten Years, released in 1982. A DVD also called The Definitive Collection was released in 2002, and features all of ABBA's videos, as well as five bonus videos and a picture gallery. In the US the 2-CD set was bundled with the DVD. In 2003, the album was ranked number 179 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time. The album was re-released in 2012 as The Essential Collection with different artwork. This version removed both bonus tracks but added four tracks for which there were promotional videos: \"Bang-A-Boomerang\", \"That's Me\", \"One Man, One Woman\" and \"Happy New Year\". These tracks were included chronologically, and additionally \"Thank You for the Music\" was moved from the end of the album to its chronological place after \"Eagle\".

	dbo:abstract	"The Tain is an EP by The Decemberists released in 2004 by Acuarela Discos and in 2005 by Kill Rock Stars. The single 18-plus minute track, in five parts, is named after the Irish mythological epic T\u00E1in B\u00F3 C\u00FAailnge, often simply called The T\u00E1in. With production help from Chris Walla of Death Cab for Cutie, the Decemberists recorded the EP over the course of four days in Walla's studio in Seattle, Washington. The album cover was designed by the Portland artist Carson Ellis, who is Colin Meloy's wife and has created artwork for each of the group's albums. The lyrics to the Decemberists' song do not directly reference the characters or plot of the Irish epic. Part III contains the only explicit reference in the lyric, \"the mirror's soft silver tain reflects our last and birthing hour\". It is possible that the song was not originally intended to have any connection to the epic itself. The accompanying video by Andy Smetanka does tell the traditional Tain story with silhouettes interspersed by minimal captions, in the manner of a silent movie, but the action in the video proceeds completely independent of the music. As well, a music video for the track was made entirely from silhouette crepe paper stop motion animation, and is available on The Decemberists: A Practical Handbook DVD and the Pitchfork Media music website."@en ;

According to Spin magazine, the album is a landmark moment for The Roots and the collective, as it \"swelled the Roots clique into a movement-style posse\". The album has been considered by music writers as The Roots's breakthrough album, earning praise from major publications and critics, while becoming the group's first record to sell over 500,000 copies. It includes the song \"You Got Me\", which won the 2000 Grammy Award for Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group, while Things Fall Apart was also nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Rap Album of the same year, losing to Eminem for his The Slim Shady LP. Rolling Stone called it a \"top-flight record\", while AllMusic cited it as \"one of the cornerstone albums of alternative rap.\" The album takes its title from Chinua Achebe's novel of the same name, which in turn took the phrase from William Butler Yeats's poem \"The Second Coming\". As of April 5, 1999, Things Fall Apart has been certified gold in sales by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).

Keyboard player Darren Wharton also offered a stronger musical influence to Thin Lizzy's final studio album, co-writing many of the tracks including \"Some Day She Is Going to Hit Back\", and the final single \"The Sun Goes Down\". A farewell tour followed the album's release, followed by the live album Life. The group's co-founder, frontman and bass player Phil Lynott died in 1986 from drug-related causes."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Till Death Do Us Part is the fourth studio album by the Houston gangsta rap group the Geto Boys, released in March 1993 on Rap-A-Lot Records. Rapper Willie D had left the group in 1992 temporarily to pursue a solo career. In his position, fellow Rap-A-Lot member Big Mike joined Scarface and Bushwick Bill for this album. Till Death Do Us Part became the group's first #1 on the R&B/hip hop charts, and also included the group's second top 40 Billboard Hot 100 single, \"Six Feet Deep\" (which used a sample from The Commodores' 1977 hit single \"Easy\"). Other singles released from the album were \"Crooked Officer\" and \"Straight Gangstaism\". Till Death Do Us Part was produced by the Rap-A-Lot in-house producer N.O. Joe. It featured guitar, bass guitar and keyboards by Mike Dean, bass guitar by Roger Tausz, bass guitar and percussion by Preston Middleton, and scratches by DJ Domination. The album was certified gold by the RIAA on May 10, 1993. There is a Chopped & Screwed version by OG Ron C available. There were four music videos releases for the songs in Till Death Do Us Part, for \"Six Feet Deep\", \"Crooked Officer\", \"Straight Gangstaism\" and \"Street Life\". The music video for \"Street Life\" was originally released for the song as an individual single for the soundtrack of the movie South Central and was also added to the album. The album version for \"Straight Gangstaism\" has two verses by Big Mike and one by his group-mate from Convicts, Mr. 3-2, and it was released as a single to boost Big Mike's popularity as a member of the Geto Boys. To avoid confusion among fans and to improve promotion, the video version (and the radio edit) added a fourth verse by Scarface to the end of the song."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Tourist was the second album by English rock band Athlete, released in January 2005 (see 2005 in British music). For this album, Athlete demonstrate a more mature musical style, creating a more stripped-down, sombre and reflective album than their first album Vehicles & Animals. The first single from the album, \"Wires\", became the biggest hit so far for the band when it entered the UK Singles Chart at #4. The album also fared well in the charts, reaching the top of the UK Albums Chart the week it was released, selling 89,000 copies. Despite this success, Tourist had a mixed critical reception, with some suggesting that Athlete had failed to sustain the unique style of their previous album, while others saw the new album as a logical progression from their old sound. Despite the mainstream breakthrough the band achieved with this album, their fanbase was reduced to a mere cult when follow-up Beyond the Neighbourhood became their smallest-seller. At the end of 2005, Tourist became the 32nd best-selling album of the year in the UK, and \"Wires\" was the 89th best-selling single. This album has been released with the Copy Control protection system in some regions. In 2010, \"Chances\" was featured in the Doctor Who Series 5 episode, \"Vincent and the Doctor\"."@en ;

On February 11, 2007, it won the Grammy Award for Best Rock or Rap Gospel Album. From Amazon.com: \"With this album I want to focus, more than ever before, on my purpose in life,\" he explains. \"I've been so incredibly blessed. My wife and I just had our fifth anniversary. I get to do what I love for a living. But it wasn't so long ago that I was spiraling downward in a lot of ways, until God touched my life and set me on the right track. I feel a huge debt to give glory back to Him for everything He has done for me. It's the least I can do.\" That said, Turn Around is not slotted only to listeners who have - or have not - undergone this kind of transformation. It inspires, excites, and gets people on their feet - but it doesn't preach. \"I understand that not everybody believes as I do,\" Lang says, \"which is fine. I just want to sing about what's going on in my life and let people make up their own minds about that.\" For all the conviction that Lang brings to Turn Around, the album began almost as an afterthought. Lang was in the studio one day with his producer, Ron Fair, who is also president of A&M/Interscope Records. There wasn't anything pressing on the agenda; they were doing routine work on the final stages of Lang's previous record, Long Time Coming. Then, out of the blue, Fair said something completely unexpected. \"He looks at me and goes, `Dude, you need to make a gospel record,'\" Lang says, laughing at the recollection. \"Now, I hadn't really mentioned much to Ron about that side of my life, but for some reason he knew where I was at. So I thought about it for just a second and said, `Yes, I do.'\""@en ;

Lavigne wrote most of the album with singer-songwriter Chantal Kreviazuk, who invited her to a Malibu in-house recording studio shared by Kreviazuk and her husband Raine Maida, where Lavigne recorded many of the songs. The album was produced by Maida, Don Gilmore, and Butch Walker. Under My Skin was mostly well-received by contemporary critics and debuted at number-one on the U.S. Billboard 200 albums chart and according to Billboard magazine, was ranked number 149 on the list of top-selling albums of the 2000s. It has sold more than 12 million copies worldwide, 3 million of which were sold in the United States, ranking the album No. 149 on the Billboard 200 Decade End Chart. Because of the album's darker vibe reminiscent of post-grunge, nu metal and more melodic rocker songs, it received generally positive reception from critics."@en ;

He knew immediately he wanted to record it. Two singles were released from this album, the first being the song \"Somewhere Over the Rainbow/What a Wonderful World\" which reached #11 in the UK Singles Chart and stayed for 6 weeks.

The album features the singles \"Two Turntables & a Mic\", \"War Zone\" and \"This Is What It Sounds Like [Worldwind]\".

Although War Zone has its share of gritty and hardcore tracks (similarly found on Enta Da Stage), the majority of War Zone consists of songs talking about social and economic problems, as Buckshot displays a maturity unseen on Enta Da Stage."@en ;

The album was written and produced by Nile Rodgers and Bernard Edwards of the band Chic, and includes four hit singles: the anthemic title track, \"He's the Greatest Dancer\", \"Lost in Music\", and \"Thinking of You\", all four of which have been sampled, remixed, and re\u2013issued through the 1980s, 1990s and 2000s. Chic worked with Sister Sledge, who had signed to Atlantic in 1973, at the inspiration of Atlantic president Jerry Greenberg. Nile Rodgers remembered later; \" That's why we came up with We Are Family. [-] Everything he said about them gave us a picture of them. You've got to remember, we never even met them. [-] All of the content on that record came from that one day with the president [-] I was fascinated and enthralled by the concept of people who loved music who could be 'nice girls' in the midst of the whole disco era.\" We Are Family is one of two albums produced by Bernard Edwards and Nile Rodgers in 1979, the other being Chic's third album Risqu\u00E9 including hit singles \"Good Times\" and \"My Forbidden Lover\". Nile Rodgers has written that of the various albums produced by The Chic Organization for themselves and others, \"pound for pound, I think We Are Family is our best album hands down.\" The lead vocals to We Are Family were recorded in a single take by the then 18-year-old Kathy Sledge. \"He's the Greatest Dancer\" was the first single from the album and became the group's first major hit, reaching the pop top ten and number one on the R&B chart. We Are Family was digitally remastered and reissued on CD by Rhino Records in 1995."@en ;

While the work has received praise from multiple critics and was a commercial success, the drummer's death brought concerns that the group would have to fold. The ironic nature of the text \"Not To Be Taken Away\" that was written on Moon's chair was cited by some critics. In 1985, MCA Records re-released the album on CD, containing the songs from the original LP. In 1996, the album was re-released in remixed form. Some of the elements from the original mixes were eliminated, including on the songs \"Had Enough\", \"905\" and \"Guitar and Pen\".

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Wiggle_(album)>	rdf:type	schema:MusicAlbum ;
	dbo:abstract	"Wiggle is the fifth studio album by the American punk rock band Screeching Weasel. It was released on January 15, 1993 through Lookout! Records. Their previous album, My Brain Hurts, had seen a sharp rise in the band's popularity and a shift in sound towards mid-tempo pop songs. With Wiggle, the band shifted gears yet again. Though several tracks retained the catchy, pop-punk sound, many others saw the band venturing into experiments with new wave and some of the harder-edged sounds of the early albums. Another major change was the amount of collaboration in songwriting. Rather than Ben Weasel being the sole author of the majority of the songs, Wiggle features a few credited to the entire band, one by guitarist Danny Vapid, and a couple with bassist (for only this album) Johnny Personality. In addition to this, there are three songs co-written by Joe King of The Queers, which were also recorded by his band. The album received mixed reviews. Many expected a continuation of the previous album and were surprised by the experimentation and harder-edged production. Since its initial release, many of the songs have come to be regarded as the band's best. Others have not held up so well over time. The band has voiced some regrets about the recording of the album, which allowed each member a voice in the mixing of specific songs and resulted in a less cohesive sound. There have also been regrets about the songs chosen for the album in recent years. The bonus tracks of the original Lookout! CD release are \"Teenage Slumber Party\", \"Danny Is a Wimp\", and \"Going Home\". The lyrics to \"Going Home\" were written by Aaron Cometbus of Crimpshrine, and the music by Weasel. After a short time of being out of print, the album was remastered by producer Mass Giorgini and re-released with an additional bonus track \"Fuck the World\" (another song co-written by Joe King of The Queers) on Asian Man Records in 2005. The band had recorded another version of this song entitled \"Amy Saw Me Looking at Her Boobs\" which was released on the compilation album Thank You Very Little. The Queers released their version of the song on their album Love Songs for the Retarded."@en ;

Recording sessions for the album took place primarily at StadiumRed in New York in April 2011. The band members took control of all of the production duties alongside the album's recording engineers, Andrew Everding and Joseph Pedulla. Wildlife was their last release on No Sleep Records before forming their own record label, Better Living. Noted by music writers for its varied elements, Wildlife incorporates musical components from La Dispute's previous releases, particularly Somewhere at the Bottom of the River Between Vega and Altair and Here, Hear III., and genres such as screamo, progressive rock and post-rock. The album features lyrical themes that \u2013 while making several references to the band's home town of Grand Rapids \u2013 focus on personal loss, anger, and despair and, in the vision of the band, is a collection of unpublished \"short stories\" from a hypothetical author, complete with the author\u2019s notes and sectioned thematically by the use of four monologues. The album debuted at number 135 on the US Billboard 200 chart, selling 3,140 copies in its first week. It spent one week on the chart and charted only in the United States. Prior to its release, Wildlife was promoted with two singles, \"Harder Harmonies\" and \"The Most Beautiful Bitter Fruit\".

	dbo:abstract	"With (stylized as WITH) is the eighth Japanese studio album (fifteenth overall) by South Korean pop duo Tohoshinki, released by Avex Trax on December 17, 2014. The record was released in four physical versions \u2013 Version A, a CD+DVD version with music videos and live performances; Version B, another CD+DVD version with off-shot movies; Version C, a CD only version with two bonus tracks; and Version D, a fan club limited edition with a CD-Extra. Recording and writing for the album roughly began in the summer of 2013. With is described to be an album composed of nostalgic dance-pop songs that are influenced by disco and jazz, accompanied by marching drumbeats. Its lyrical content explores the general concept of love and friendship. With was a commercial success, debuting at number one on the Billboard Japan Top Albums Chart and the Oricon Albums Chart, selling 233,000 copies on the first week of release. In doing so, Tohoshinki became the first foreign artists in Japan to top the Oricon Albums Chart four times in a row. Tohoshinki are also the first foreign artists in Japan to have four consecutive albums sell 200,000 or more copies in a week. With the addition of With, Tohoshinki became the third international music act, after Simon & Garfunkel and Bon Jovi, to have released five number one albums in Japan. By the end of the year, With earned a platinum certification by the Recording Industry Association of Japan (RIAJ) for shipments of over 250,000 copies. The album has two commercially successful singles \u2013 \"Sweat / Answer\" and \"Time Works Wonders\" \u2013 both which debuted at number two on the Oricon Singles Chart and achieved Gold certifications by the Recording Industry Association of Japan (RIAJ). To promote the album, Tohoshinki will embark on their second nationwide five-Dome tour, the With: Live Tour 2015, from February to March 2015."@en ;

Dade alternately known as Future Pilot A.K.A., \"The City of Lights\", which was included on his 2006 album, Secrets of the Clockhouse. \"The City of Lights\" was recorded in Glasgow, 2005, with Dade producing. \"Finding You\", \"Ashes on the Lawn\" and \"Crystal Shacks\" were recorded during the Oceans Apart sessions, at the Good Luck Studios in London between November 2004 and January 2005. \"Sleeping Giant\" however was recorded in Brisbane in 2004. \"Sleeping Giant\", according to Robert Forster, was one of the songs which failed to make it on to their album, The Friends of Rachel Worth, in 2000. Because he wrote the song in 1998 about his son, Louis, Forster later jokingly said \"I've now retitled it 'An Old Song That I Wrote about My Son.'\" \"He's four now. It was just after he was born... I like the song... I'm scared of turning into Graham Nash, you know, the sort of person who writes about their children. It's a scary area. But I think its done quite well.\" Similarly \"Ashes on the Lawn\" was intended to be included on the band's eighth studio album, Bright Yellow Bright Orange, but also failed to make the cut. Pickvance describes it as being \"quite a suprise [sic] as a Go-Betweens song. It was a Go-Betweens song because you can hear it's Robert and Grant singing. But music-wise it was a bit of a shock... the way it was structured, or recorded, it was really a stadium-rock song.\""@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"I Believe My Heart is an album by British singer Keedie. It was released on 18 November 2004. The album has a mixture of genres and songwriters. Two classics; \"Ave Maria\" and the aria \"Un bel d\u00EC vedremo\" are sung in English. Seven other arias feature on the album (two of which are hidden). The classics include Rutter's version of 'Pie Jesu' and Sarah Brightman's/Andrea Bocelli's 'Time To Say Goodbye'. There are two popular covers featured on the album which are Madonna's \"You'll See\" and Enya's \"Only Time\". The album also features seven original songs. Two of these songs are interludes that Keedie co-wrote herself; \"Interlude\" and \"Fio Est Toute\". \"I Believe My Heart\" was written by Andrew Lloyd Webber and David Zippel for their musical The Woman In White. \"My Reason\" (a favourite among Keedie fans) was composed by Guy Farley for the film Modigliani. Farley was so impressed with Keedie's voice that he approached her to sing the theme song from the film. The song is sung in English in an operatic style and is often praised for its emotional arrangement and Keedie's highly passionate delivery of the lyrics. Ben Robbins and Steve Hart both wrote the original songs \"The Star In You\" and \"All Because Of You\". Both of the songs have a pop-like arrangement but are sung operatically in English. Chris Neil is responsible for the intimate \"One Day\"."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"1985 is the fourth studio album by Enuff Z'Nuff, which features material recorded in the band's earliest days. The songs were taken from a demo at the time called \"Hollywood Squares\", originally recorded in 1985. Musically, the songs were noticeably more pop-rock in direction as opposed to the hard rock recordings they had been known for. Although nearly all original material, the opening track is a cover of Smokey Robinson's \"Tears Of A Clown\". The only new recording at the time of release was a bonus track titled \"You Got A Hold Of Me\" (sometimes referred to as \"The Valentine's Song\" due to its opening lyric). This song is noteworthy for the fact that it was used as the album's lead promotional single, despite being an unlisted \"hidden track\". The liner notes were written by popular American shock-jock and longtime fan Howard Stern. His words regarding the band were later reprinted for the band's Greatest Hits album several years later. The song \"Fingers On It\" first appeared in the cult film Henry: Portrait Of A Serial Killer, with the band credited as \"Enough Z'Nuff,\" as that was the original spelling of the band name when the movie was made. The album artwork parodies the cover design of Road & Track. The cover mentions the Ferrari car brand and State Farm financial institution."@en ;

It is the follow-up to his debut album The Chronic (1992). It was produced primarily by Dr. Dre and Mel-Man, as well as Lord Finesse, and features several guest contributions from fellow American rappers such as The D.O.C., Hittman, Snoop Dogg, Kurupt, Xzibit, Nate Dogg, and Eminem. 2001 exhibits an expansion on his debut's G-funk sound and contains gangsta rap themes such as violence, promiscuity, drug use, street gangs, and crime. The album debuted at number two on the U.S. Billboard 200 chart, selling 516,000 copies in its first week. It produced three singles that attained chart success and has been certified sextuple platinum in sales by the RIAA after sales of six million copies in the United States.

It was released on her return to Hong Kong in 1992 after her year-long stay in New York City. Wong had issued her first three official albums under the stage name Shirley Wong. The cover for Coming Home prominently shows the name \"Faye\", and from 1994, after the release of Sky she used name \"W\u00E1ng F\u0113i\" (\u738B\u83F2) on album sleeves. Coming Home was a notable change in musical direction from the more traditional Cantopop fare of her earlier albums. Like them, it incorporated R&B influences. This album included \"Fragile Woman\", a cover of a Japanese song \"Rouge\" composed by the Jpop diva Miyuki Nakajima and sung by Naomi Chiaki. While this song had been covered by other Chinese singers[who?], Wong's version nonetheless swept over Hong Kong and single-handedly lifted her to stardom. It became the No.1 hit on almost all local radio stations and won Song of the Year at several musical awards. (Thanks to Wong's cover, this 1972 song\u2013in different language versions\u2013would in the early 1990s become a huge regional hit in Thailand, Vietnam and the rest of Southeast Asia and even Turkey; the most popular English version was titled \"Broken-Hearted Woman\".) Wong also recorded a Mandarin version of \"Fragile Woman\", released on her 1994 compilation album Faye Best (\u6700\u83F2). The album also included her first English-language song, \"Kisses in the Wind\". Wong stated in a 1994 concert that she very much liked this song, after which various websites listed it as her personal favourite."@en ;

It was produced by the band along with Thom Panunzio and released on September 19, 2006 through Geffen Records. Written and demoed at the Morning View Mansion in Malibu, California during 2005, Coming Home is a concept album unified by a lyrical theme of being away from home and loved ones. The album marks a departure from the band's earlier work, implementing a more layered and mid-tempo sound that features various piano, keyboard, and string instrumentation more comparable to classic rock than their usual pop punk style. Coming Home was a critical success for the band, and is widely regarded as one of their best records. The album was particularly noted for its matured style, while the songs were considered the most \"mellow\" of the band's career. Despite the release of only one single, \"It's Not Your Fault\", the album was still a relative commercial success, debuting at number eight on the Billboard Rock Albums chart and number nineteen on the Billboard 200. The Japanese edition, issued on September 13, 2006, features three bonus tracks. Another bonus track is exclusively available with a digital download of the album from the iTunes Store, while Best Buy customers received a voucher inside their CD cases for the download of a fifth bonus track called \"Over Me\".

The album was named in reference to the success of 1992's New Miserable Experience, followed so closely by the suicide of the former band member Doug Hopkins in 1993. Reaction to Congratulations I'm Sorry was mixed, with some critics feeling that the music lay too close to the sound of the previous album. One common complaint was that most versions of the album lacked the successful 1995 single \"Til I Hear It From You\", from the Empire Records soundtrack; however, some editions of the album did contain the track as its final. The album's title, according to the lead singer Robin Wilson, came from the response band members usually received from people who both wanted to congratulate the band for the success of New Miserable Experience, while then offering apologies for their friend and former band member Doug Hopkins. The album eventually reached platinum status."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Day After Day: Live is a CD release by Rykodisc in 1990 of live recordings made by the British rock group Badfinger in 1974. During a concert tour in the Midwestern United States in 1974, Badfinger learned that the Agora venue in Cleveland, Ohio, contained a 16-track studio capable of live recordings. The group had released five studio albums up to this point but had not made any professional live recordings. Deciding to utilise the equipment, Badfinger recorded two of their shows at the Agora. Due to audio distortion and essentially a moderate performance by the group, the tapes were not used at the time. The Agora recordings circulated as bootlegs for several years before band member Joey Molland brought them to the attention of Rykodisc in 1989. Molland performed a great deal of rework to the recordings, including overdubbing his vocals, several guitars, and some of the bass. He also used a computer-sampled drum snare to enhance the original drum track. Molland also rearranged the song order of the performances, placing Pete Ham's compositions at the end of the CD. As a result of Molland's augmentation, the CD has been bitterly reviewed by music critics and fans. Complications arose for Molland in the mid 1990s when other Badfinger parties objected to the release, citing they were not properly notified. There was also some confusion as to the ownership of the original tapes, which Molland testified were taken by his wife when he resigned from the group in 1974. A lawsuit in Great Britain resolved that Molland should have proceeded differently when releasing the CD, but generally ruled in his favour regarding royalty divisions (which included Molland's compensation for production work)."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Do You Know is the second album by American singer Michelle Williams, released on January 26, 2004 via Sanctuary/Columbia Records. Do You Know \"straddles between contemporary gospel and inspirational R&B\" and is described as portraying \"a more intimate side of Michelle\". It contains a greater percentage of mid and up-tempo songs, along with a much heavier and grander use of live instrumentation. Williams contributed lyrically to the album as she did with her debut album, co-writing a total of six songs. However, Do You Know is much more diverse, lyrically, than its predecessor Heart to Yours, covering the themes of \"spiritual\" and \"carnal\" love and contains retrospective songs about Williams' career thus far, whilst still retaining the inspirational and encouraging lyrics that characterised Heart to Yours. In the US, Do You Know found fair success on Billboard's component charts; peaking at number two on the Gospel Albums chart, number three on the Christian Albums chart and number twenty-eight on the Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart. However, the album peaked at one-hundred-and-twenty on the Billboard 200, making it Williams' lowest-charting album. Though the album was well received by critics, it sold only 10,000 copies in its first week of release. Despite this, the album was later re-released, including two new tracks and has now sold over 78,000 copies in the US alone as of 2008. The album gained Williams a nomination for \"Best Gospel Act\" at the 2004 MOBO Awards."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Easy is an album recorded by Marvin Gaye and Tammi Terrell, and released by Motown Records on September 16, 1969 under the Tamla Records label. One song on the album, \"Good Lovin' Ain't Easy To Come By\", was a hit single and remains popular to this day. Terrell had been ill, suffering from complications caused by a brain tumor, since the fall of 1967. Marvin Gaye later claimed that as a result, most of the female vocals on this album were performed by Valerie Simpson, who served as co-songwriter and co-producer for the LP with her boyfriend and future husband Nickolas Ashford. Simpson is quoted in Ludie Montgomery's biography of Terrell, My Sister Tommie, as not having subbed Terrell for vocals. Simpson again explicitly denied having done so in the liner notes to The Complete Motown Singles series. On a recent documentary on Terrell, Simpson admitted she sang with Gaye during sessions saying, \"I sang things with Marvin because Tammi was not available. And, then we would bring Tammi in to go over her parts. Those are Tammi Terrell vocals because we know that we went back in with Tammi and got what we needed.\" Gaye at the time criticized Motown for the album thinking they were taking advantage of Terrell's health. Motown assured him proceeds from the album would go to Terrell's family for insurance of her health. At the time the album was released, Terrell was on her seventh operation to cure the brain tumor that would eventually kill her after the eighth operation. The album was released on compact disc in 1992, and again in 2001 as part of The Complete Duets."@en ;

Like its predecessor, Chrome, it was produced by Gil Norton, and the influences of heavy metal and hard rock are prevalent on this album; however, the band does retain some elements of the shoegazing style that dominated their previous albums, particularly on the songs \"Heal\" and \"Eat My Dust You Insensitive Fuck\". \"Judy Staring at the Sun\" featured guest vocals by Tanya Donelly. In the single mix, Donelly performs the song's chorus and second verse; on the album, however, her vocals appear only in the chorus, and all verses are sung by Rob Dickinson. The single peaked at number 22 on the Billboard Modern Rock Tracks chart; second single \"Waydown\" peaked at number 15 on the Modern Rock chart and number 24 on the Mainstream Rock Tracks chart. The album peaked at number five on the Billboard Top Heatseekers chart, and was also the band's first album to chart on The Billboard 200, peaking at number 163."@en ;

It was released on 24 October 2005. The lead single \"Looking for Water\" was released prior to the album as an exclusively internet-download release, and failed to make the charts on downloads alone. The album received mixed reviews and charted at number 24. There were hopes that a second single, the title track \"Honesty\", released on 23 January 2006, would revive interest in the album. However, the single received minimal promotion and radio airplay, despite strong video airplay on The Hits and B4, as well as limited distribution, and entered the chart at number 56. Honesty represents a distinct shift in genre from Parks' first album Introduction, which was clearly in the commercial pop genre. Honesty is predominantly alternative folk pop with some rock and chill out influences, and includes a hidden track, \"Tail and All\", with a French samba rhythm. Three very distinctive rock B-sides \u2014 \"Near Death Experience\", \"Just Love\" and \"Black & White\" \u2014 were released with the two singles from this album."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"J.Lo is the second studio album and most successful album to date by American entertainer Jennifer Lopez. It was released on January 23, 2001, by Epic Records. Preceding the release for the follow-up of her commercially successful debut album On the 6 (1999). On this album, Lopez had more creative control over J.Lo. Its title refers to the nickname her fans gave her, and she described it as a homage to her supporters. Lopez began recording the album under the working title 'The Passionate Journey', writing lyrics that focused on her own personal experiences. For the album, she hired producers such as Cory Rooney, Troy Oliver, Dan Shea and Sean Combs, (her boyfriend at the time), all of whom contributed to her first album. Musically, J.Lo is a pop album, which also encompasses genres such as R&B, Latin pop, retro and dance-pop. It was considered more daring than On the 6, including more explicit language and provocative lyrics about sex; it also deals with themes of empowerment and relationships. Upon its release, the album received mixed reviews from music critics, who criticized its manufactured sound, although some praised its Spanish songs and dance material. Commercially, J.Lo became Lopez's most successful album. The album debuted at number one on the US Billboard 200, on the same week as her film The Wedding Planner, which led to the domestic box office, making her the first entertainer to have both a number one film and album simultaneously. The album was certified quadruple platinum in the United States, and became the sixth best-selling album of the year worldwide. \"Love Don't Cost a Thing\" was released as the album's lead single on December 2, 2000, which reached the top five in the United States and number one in United Kingdom. The album's second single, \"Play\" (released on March 27, 2001), reached the top twenty in most countries and top five in United Kingdom. The Latin pop song, titled \"Ain't It Funny\" was released as the album's third single on June 20, 2001. \"I'm Real\" was serviced to radio as the album's fourth and final single on September 4, 2001. To further its success, record executives at Epic recruited Ja Rule of Murder, Inc., who is popular in the Urban market, to create a remix of the song, \"I'm Real (Murder Remix)\". The remix, which featured Ja Rule, shifted Lopez's personal style from pop to a more hip-hop and urban-oriented sound. It was the number one song in the United States at the time of the September 11 attacks for 5 non-consecutive weeks."@en ;

It is the band's first album to feature new drummer Alexis Nunez who joined in 2012, replacing Paul Garred. The album was preceded by singles \"Down\", \"Around Town\", \"Bad Habit\" and \"Forgive & Forget\". Stylistically, the album differs from the band's previous work as elements of jazz, gospel, and R&B were added into the music. This album also marks the first time Tony Hoffer did not produce the band's work. Instead production was handled by Inflo, Luke Pritchard and Fraser T Smith. Listen is the band's first album in three years, with Junk of the Heart being released in September 2011. The album was recorded in Los Angeles and London. Upon its release, Listen debuted at No. 16 on the UK Albums Chart and failed to meet the commercial expectations set forth by the band's previous work."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Live...in the Heart of the City is a 1980 live album by British rock band Whitesnake. Originally released as a double-vinyl album, and double-play cassette, it utilises recordings made in 1978 and 1980. The album charted at number 5 on the UK Albums Chart, and number 146 on the Billboard 200. Sides 1 and 2 of the vinyl are from recordings made with the Rolling Stones Mobile Studio at the Hammersmith Odeon, during the band's 1980 World Tour, whilst sides 3 and 4 are from a 1978 recording, previously issued and released in Japan only as Live at Hammersmith. The first UK CD version (EMI CZD 94) was a 2-CD set, issued in 1988, in what is now known as a 'fat-boy' double-CD case. Sides 1 and 2 of the 2-LP set were CD1; sides 3 and 4 were CD2. The later 1994 release was a single CD version, the 1978 recording of \"Come On\" being dropped to match the restrictive running-time of the single CD. Live...in the Heart of the City has since been remastered and was released in March 2007 as a 2-CD set (in a slimline double-CD case), once again featuring all the tracks of the original album, together with a 1980 recording of \"Ain't No Love in the Heart of the City\" as a bonus track.

Following so close to the attacks, Anderson makes several statements about them in her recognizable style. The performance is highlighted by a performance of \"O Superman,\" the song that launched Anderson to stardom in 1981 and that contains lyrics that can\u2014in retrospect\u2014be seen to relate to the terrorist attacks.

The soundtracks of the series' installments have been released in album form in Japan, with the exceptions of 2089, 2089-II, and Border of Madness, which reuse music from the other installments, and Evolved, which was published in 2010. The soundtrack to Front Mission was released in 1995 by NTT Publishing, which also published the soundtrack to Front Mission: Gun Hazard in 1996. DigiCube published soundtrack albums for Front Mission 2 and Alternative in 1997 and 3 in 1999. Square Enix published the albums for Front Mission 4 in 2004, and 5 and Online in 2006. The soundtracks of the series have been warmly reviewed by critics, especially those of the main series and Gun Hazard. The music of Alternative and Online was less well received. The music of the series typically includes a fusion of electronic and orchestral music, though each game and composer in the series has taken the music in different directions. The composers for the series have included Yoko Shimomura, Noriko Matsueda, Koji Hayama, Hayato Matsuo, Hidenori Iwasaki, and Garry Schyman. A box set of music from across the series is currently planned, but has not yet been formally announced or given a release date."@en ;

Musicians such as Lowell George and Wilton Felder worked with Cale on the release. In contrast to the experimental rock of much of John Cale's work before and after Paris 1919, the album is noted for its orchestral-influenced style, reminiscent of contemporary pop rock music. It has been suggested that one reason for the sound was the employment of Procol Harum producer Chris Thomas as producer for Paris 1919. The baroque pop ethos of some songs have been positively compared to 1960s-era releases by artists such as Brian Wilson and The Left Banke. The album has received critical praise from several publications over the years, with reviewer Jason Ankeny of Allmusic labeling the release as one \"of John Cale's very finest solo efforts\" and Stephen Holden of Rolling Stone calling it \"one of the most ambitious albums ever released under the name of 'pop'\"; he also called it a masterpiece."@en ;

It was produced by Mike Shipley on a considerable budget and marked a significant change in Winger's sound, eschewing their pop-metal anthems prevalent in their first two albums for a harder and more aggressive style of music with a good dose of socio-political leanings on tracks like \"Blind Revolution Mad\", \"In for the Kill\", and \"Who's the One\". The material was also less commercial and radio friendly, evident especially in the track \"Junkyard Dog (Tears on Stone)\" incorporating contemporary heavy metal and progressive elements and clocking in at 6:54. The album is often regarded as the favourite among the group's fans, but in terms of sales figures the album was not as successful as the two first albums, peaking at #83 on Billboard's Album chart. Pull was recorded by Winger as a trio, as guitarist/keyboardist Paul Taylor left the band after the In the Heart of the Young tour in 1992.

	dbo:abstract	"Rift is the fourth official studio album by the American rock band Phish. It is the band's second concept album, the first being The Man Who Stepped into Yesterday in 1987, which has never been officially released. Rift's songs convey the experience of a man dreaming about the rift in his relationship with his girlfriend. Recorded in September and October 1992 and produced by Muscle Shoals music veteran Barry Beckett, the album was released by Elektra Records on February 2, 1993. All songs were written by Trey Anastasio and Phish lyricist Tom Marshall except \"Mound\" and \"Weigh\" by bass guitarist Mike Gordon and \"Lengthwise\" by drummer Jon Fishman. The instrumental, \"All Things Reconsidered\", is an intentional variation on the theme to the National Public Radio news show All Things Considered, and has been featured on the show itself several times. An orchestral version of the song appears on Trey Anastasio's 2004 solo album Seis De Mayo. The cover art was created by New York-based painter David Welker, who worked closely with the band during winter 1993 in order to visually depict each of the album's tracks in a single image, with the notable exception of \"The Horse\". (For this reason, a horse intentionally appears on the cover of Phish's next album, Hoist). Relix magazine listed Rift as one of the most iconic album covers of all time in 2007. Rift' was certified gold by the RIAA on October 15, 1997."@en ;

It peaked at number twenty-four on the U.S. Billboard 200 chart, and opened to critical acclaim. It produced three international singles: \"I'm Like a Bird\", \"Turn Off the Light\" and \"... On the Radio (Remember the Days)\". \"Party's Just Begun (Again)\" was a club-only single released exclusively in the U.S. before the album's availability in stores, and it was included on the soundtrack of the 1999 film Brokedown Palace. When \"Party's Just Begun (Again)\" was released, Furtado's label was unsure about the genre in which to market her. They eventually remixed \"Party's Just Begun (Again)\" and included it on this album as \"Party\". The DreamWorks label released \"Trynna Finda Way\" as the fourth single in Mexico and South America, and \"Hey, Man!\" as the fourth single in the UK and Germany. The album spent seventy-eight weeks on the Billboard 200. It hit double-platinum status in the U.S. in January 2002. After the release of the album, Furtado headlined the Burn in the Spotlight tour and appeared on Moby's Area:One tour. According to Maclean's magazine, Whoa, Nelly! has sold 9 million copies Worldwide as of 2015. The album also caught the eye of record producer Timbaland, who later signed Furtado to his record label."@en ;

Additional music was provided by Masaharu Iwata and Hayato Matsuo, who also orchestrated the opening and ending themes. Former regular series composer Nobuo Uematsu's only work for this game was \"Kiss Me Good-Bye\", the theme song sung by Angela Aki. The Final Fantasy XII Original Soundtrack was released on four Compact Discs in 2006 by Aniplex. A sampling of tracks from the soundtrack was released as an album entitled Selections from Final Fantasy XII Original Soundtrack, and was released in 2006 by Tofu Records. Additionally, a promotional digital album titled The Best of Final Fantasy XII was released on the Japanese localization of iTunes for download only in 2006. \"Kiss Me Good-Bye\" was released by Epic Records as a single in 2006, and Symphonic Poem \"Hope\", the complete music from the game's end credits, was released by Hats Unlimited in 2006. An abridged version of the latter piece, which originally accompanied a promotional video for the game, was included in the official soundtrack album. An album of piano arrangements, titled Piano Collections Final Fantasy XII, was released by Square Enix in 2012. The soundtrack received mixed reviews from critics; while several felt that it was an excellent album, others disagreed, finding it to be a good soundtrack but lacking in substance. Common complaints about the album were the large number of filler tracks, which seemed to be uninspired and hurt the soundtrack as a whole. However, several reviewers commented on \"Kiss Me Good-bye\", finding it to be one of the soundtrack's strongest areas. The singles for the soundtrack were very well received by critics, who found them to be very enjoyable but short in duration, and the piano album was considered by reviewers to be one of the best in the series. The game's soundtrack was nominated for a British Academy of Film and Television Arts award for Best Original Score."@en ;

The opening track, \"Everything Flows\", is a mellow powerpop-influenced song (unlike the rest of the album) that provides a sort of blueprint for their later work. \"Everything Flows\" was later included in the compilation albums Deep Fried Fanclub and Four Thousand Seven Hundred and Sixty-Six Seconds \u2013 A Short Cut to Teenage Fanclub.

	dbo:abstract	"Behind the Eyes is the tenth studio album, and fifteenth album by Christian music and pop music singer Amy Grant, released in 1997 (see 1997 in music). Issued near the end of Grant's marriage to Christian singer-songwriter Gary Chapman, many of the songs on Behind the Eyes reflect Grant's struggles in her marriage and all relate to a theme of optimism. Upon its release, it went to No. 2 on Billboard's Christian albums chart and No. 8 on the Billboard 200. Meanwhile, the first single from the album, \"Takes a Little Time\", was a Top Five Adult Contemporary hit and a Top Thirty pop chart single. \"Like I Love You\" and \"I Will Be Your Friend\" also reached the Adult Contemporary chart, at No. 10 and No. 27, respectively. The CD was also released in a limited two-CD version (with the second CD titled, More Music From Behind the Eyes). In 2007, Behind the Eyes was reissued and digitally remastered by Grant's new record label, EMI/Sparrow Records, along with 13 other Amy Grant albums. The remastered edition is labeled with a \"Digitally Remastered\" logo in the 'gutter' on the CD front. Because of Grant's deal with her previous label, Word Records, the remastered editions of Behind the Eyes and A Christmas to Remember were not sold in Christian Music retailers such as Family Christian Stores or Lifeway Christian Resources until 2009. Until that time, Word Records continued to distribute those titles to Christian retailers in the original, non-remastered editions while EMI distributed the remastered editions to most major retailers. The 12 remaining remastered editions are distributed by EMI to all US retailers, both Christian and secular. The album was listed at No. 44 in the 2001 book, CCM Presents: The 100 Greatest Albums in Christian Music and was Grant's most successfully charting album, reaching No. 8 on the Billboard 200, compared with Heart in Motion, which reached No. 10, and House of Love which reached No. 13."@en ;

However, the album received mixed reviews.[citation needed] The beats, created mostly by Wyclef Jean, were criticized for their blandness and unoriginality (with a fair amount of the criticism coming from Canibus), but lyrically, the album was praised. Tower Records referred to Canibus as \"one of the most innovative new MCs in hip-hop. With Can-I-Bus, the debut album, Canibus delivers more of the battle-rhyme lyrics that are his stock in trade. Still, he manages to cover new ground with conceptually strong cuts like 'I Honor U,' which is dedicated to his mother. With his lyrical skills, Canibus represents the elements that helped build rap music.\" The album has been certified gold by the RIAA.

dbr:Cathedral_Oceans	rdf:type	schema:MusicAlbum ;
	dbo:abstract	"Cathedral Oceans (after 2003 also referred to as Cathedral Oceans I) is an album of ambient music by John Foxx, released in 1997. Alongside Shifting City released on the same day, it marked Foxx's return to the music scene after an absence of seven years. It was also his first solo album since 1985's In Mysterious Ways. The album's artwork consists of collages by Foxx himself, overlaying various pictures and textures with the faces of statues. Cathedral Oceans is a long ongoing project by Foxx, the first recordings that appear on this album were made as early 1983. In 1987 Cathedral Oceans material was played live by Foxx in various buildings, gardens and cathedrals in England and Rome. As a result of the long genesis of the album it does sound somewhat fragmented in places, but the overall effect is soothing, almost pastoral ambience created by extensive usage of reverb and echo coupled with gregorian chanting. The sound of this album is far removed from the steely detached cityscapes Foxx is best known for, but it does bear resemblance to tracks such as \"The Garden\" from the album with the same name and \"Enter The Angel II\" from In Mysterious Ways. \"Sunset Rising\" was included on Foxx's 2001 compilation album Modern Art. In 2003 Cathedral Oceans (now called Cathedral Oceans I) was released as a two-disc set with Cathedral Oceans II. A third album in the series, Cathedral Oceans III, followed in 2005."@en ;

The album was recorded at RAK Studios in London during most of 2002, and was produced by Gil Norton. The band returned to live performance after Lee's suicide, playing low-key slots at various festivals in the United Kingdom, before releasing the single \"Come Back Around\" and then the album. Three further singles\u2014\"Just the Way I'm Feeling\", \"Forget About Tomorrow\" and \"Find the Colour\"\u2014followed the album's release. The album received positive reviews from the music press and was received well by the public, reaching number six on the UK Albums Chart. Although charting one place lower than predecessor Echo Park, Comfort in Sound had a much stronger chart run of 36 weeks on the weekly top 75 album chart, in comparison to the nine weeks of Echo Park. Comfort in Sound is seen as a major commercial success, selling 503,706 units in the United Kingdom and giving the band their second top ten single, \"Just the Way I'm Feeling\". Inside the inlay, there were also a number of illustrations by Aya Takayano, including a picture per song, each with a lyrical extract from four of the album's songs. The first three of these were released as singles from the album, all in their order of appearance in the booklet, which lead to beliefs that the fourth song \"Comfort in Sound\", would be the fourth single, only for \"Find the Colour\" to be released in its place instead."@en ;

The title track, written by the team of Dan Penn and Carson Whitsett with Hoy Lindsey, gained popularity (and introduced Burke to a new generation) when it was used several times on the popular primetime teen soap opera The O.C. as one of the signature song of adult couple Sandy and Kirsten Cohen, played by Peter Gallagher and Kelly Rowan.

dbr:Free_Like_We_Want_2_B	rdf:type	schema:MusicAlbum ;
	dbo:abstract	"Free Like We Want 2 B is an album by Ziggy Marley & The Melody Makers released in 1995. Perhaps more than any of the Melody Maker's previous releases, this album showcases the individual talents of each bandmember. The result is one of their most consistently inventive and musically varied sets. The stripped down, propulsive \"Power to Move Ya\" leads off, followed by the title track, a classic Ziggy composition about the real meaning of freedom. Sharon and Cedella then share lead vocals for the first time on the excellent \"Today\". Track four, \"Water and Oil\"-- a biting metaphor for the relationship between rastas and politicians\u2014features a dread DJ turn by brother Stephen. \"Live It Up\" follows, a Ziggy composition with a sweet I-Threes style chorus. Stephen introduces Miss \"Tipsy Dazy\", and follows this with a beautiful ballad-like number called \"Bygones\". Next up is the Jamaican top-ten single \"Hand to Mouth\". Track 9, titled \"In the Flow\" is a funky slow jam with a wicked bass line. \"Don't Go Nowhere\" is followed by \"G7\", a calypso-like commentary on the politics of greed. Stephen's \"Keep On\" and Ziggy's heartfelt \"Beautiful Mother Nature\" round out the set. \"Free Like We Want 2 B\" marks another milestone in the Melody Maker's recording history: it was the first release for their new label, and it was recorded at the new Marley Music studio in Kingston."@en ;

The centrepiece of the record is a 28-minute recitation by Kerouac from his book On the Road that was recorded on an acetate disc in the 1950s but thought lost for decades, and had only recently been rediscovered at the time of release. Other tracks feature Kerouac singing renditions of Jazz hits from the 1920s, '30s and '40s alongside songs and poems of his own composition. The album closes with a cover of Kerouac's track \"On the Road\" (itself included earlier on the disc) performed by Tom Waits with Primus. Video footage of the recording of this track can be seen on the Primus release Videoplasty, and the track itself was later included on the Tom Waits collection Orphans: Brawlers, Bawlers & Bastards."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Kiln House is the fourth album by British rock band Fleetwood Mac, released in 1970. This is the first of the post-Peter Green Fleetwood Mac albums, and their last album to feature Jeremy Spencer. Christine McVie was present at the recording sessions and contributed backing vocals and cover art, although she was not a full member of the band until shortly after the album's completion. The album title is taken from the name of a converted Oast house in Truncheaunts Lane, near Alton in Hampshire (UK). The house (now a grade II listed building) was leased by the band, who lived there communally, with their families, for a six-month period in 1970. Mick Fleetwood was married to his wife at the house on 20 June 1970. Spencer's retro 50s homages and parodies dominate the album, but Danny Kirwan's more sincere songs are almost equally prominent. \"Buddy's Song\" is credited to Buddy Holly's mother, but is basically the song \"Peggy Sue Got Married\" with new lyrics listing a number of Buddy Holly song titles. An early version of Kirwan's instrumental \"Earl Gray\", entitled \"Farewell\", was later released on the compilation The Vaudeville Years."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Final Fantasy XIII-2 is a role-playing video game developed and published by Square Enix in 2011 as the sequel to Final Fantasy XIII. The music of the game was composed by Masashi Hamauzu, Naoshi Mizuta, and Mitsuto Suzuki. It was intended to sound different from the music of previous Final Fantasy titles, featuring more musical styles and vocal pieces. Since the release of the game, Square Enix has published the 2011 four-disc soundtrack album, Final Fantasy XIII-2 Original Soundtrack, as well as an album of arrangements and alternate versions of tracks from the game, Final Fantasy XIII Original Soundtrack PLUS, in 2012. The theme song for the game, \"Yakusoku no Basho\" (\u7D04\u675F\u306E\u5834\u6240 The Promised Place), was released by singer Mai Fukui as a single in 2011, and the English version of the song, sung by Charice Pempengco and included in the non-Japanese versions of the game, was included on her 2012 album Infinity. Reviews of the soundtrack album were positive, with critics praising both the variety of styles and quality of the pieces. Several critics noted Mizuta's work as possibly his finest to date. Reviewers of the game were more mixed, with some feeling that some of the styles of music did not match where they were played in the game. Critics were also mixed in their opinions of the arranged album, feeling that several of the pieces were simply inferior versions of the original tracks. Both of the albums and the single sold well enough to place on the Japanese Oricon charts, with the original soundtrack album reaching a peak of #13 and remaining on the charts for eight weeks."@en ;

dbr:Painted_from_Memory	rdf:type	schema:MusicAlbum ;
	dbo:abstract	"Painted from Memory is a collaboration between Elvis Costello and Burt Bacharach. It was released 29 September 1998 on Mercury Records, a division of Universal Music Group. The collaboration commenced with \"God Give Me Strength\", a commission for the 1996 film Grace of My Heart, directed by Allison Anders, starring Illeana Douglas, with lead vocals by Kristen Vigard. Apparently pleased with the result, the pair expanded the project to this full album, the first for Costello after an absence of two years, and for Bacharach after an absence of 21 years. Lyrics and music are co-credited to both Bacharach and Costello. In his 2015 autobiography, Unfaithful Music and Disappearing Ink, Costello wrote, \"To have written a song like \"God Give Me Strength\" and simply stopped would have been ridiculous, so about a year later we began a series of writing sessions [\u2026].\" A companion album, The Sweetest Punch, was made concurrently by jazz guitarist Bill Frisell, released in 1999 on another Universal label, Decca Records. It consists of jazz arrangements of the Painted From Memory songs done by Frisell and his studio group. It features vocals by Costello on two songs, and by jazz singer Cassandra Wilson on two songs, one of which is a duet employing both. Costello had long been a Bacharach fan, and had recorded several Bacharach songs, beginning with \"I Just Don't Know What to Do with Myself,\" released on a 1978 Stiff Records compilation Live Stiffs Live. Costello would also cover \"I'll Never Fall in Love Again\" for the soundtrack to Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me. \"I Still Have That Other Girl\" won a Grammy Award in 1998 for \"Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals\" for Bacharach and Costello. Costello later wrote, \"One day, while writing \"I Still Have that Other Girl\", we reached an impasse as to how to get to the full chorus. I was looking out of the window for inspiration when Burt began to play something I'd never heard before. It sounded beautiful, sort of Viennese. We were running a digital recorder to catch our working sketches, but when the recording was played back it was mostly obscured by me yelling, \"That's it, you've got it, [...] Fortunately my overexcited babble didn't completely cover the invention, and we were able to decode the recording and complete the song\"."@en ;

Produced by Ulver, the album was issued in October, 2007, via Jester Records and The End Records. Officially announced on July 13, 2007, Shadows of the Sun received critical acclaim on release, and was described as \"dark and tragic,\" with \"soothing electronics and natural percussion,\" and featured contributions from Pamelia Kurstin on theremin and Austrian white noise musician Christian Fennesz, adding supplemental shimmer; helping Ulver to correspond with their vision on the final product. The release of Shadows of the Sun was delayed in Europe and the United States, possibly caused by problems with the vinyl manufacturing. The album was distributed by Plastic Head, the UK's 10th largest distributor in Europe. The entire album was leaked to the Internet on September 17, 2007. The track listing and the album sleeve was released to the public in a press statement by Ulver's American record label The End Records, and a teaser for the song \"Vigil\" was released on MySpace on August 29, 2007. On August 30, Ulver announced a release party for the album to be held at the Europa Night Club in Brooklyn, NY on September 20, 2007 with Kristoffer Rygg and Tore Ylwizaker were DJing, while The Austerity Program and Lapdog of Satan were playing live. On 13 September, Jester Records made it possible to pre-order the album, including a limited vinyl edition, with alternate front cover by David D'Andrea. The collector's deal also included a 10\" red vinyl edition of A Quick Fix of Melancholy. The End Records also released a special deal consisting of the CD edition of the album, a T-shirt, and a screen print by Tomi Lahdesmaki in a limited run of 200.[citation needed] On MySpace, \"Vigil\" was replaced by the song \"Funebre,\" on 14 September 2007. \"Solitude\" is a Black Sabbath cover; the original version appears on their 1971 album Master of Reality, while \"Eos\" is a revisited version of \"Gravferd,\" from the soundtrack of the Norwegian film Uno. \"What Happened?\" contains approximately 1 minute and 40 seconds of silence at the end. The front photo is taken from the 1978 October issue of Natural History Magazine. Shadows of the Sun is the first album without an appearance from H\u00E5vard J\u00F8rgensen, a full-time member on Ulver's first four albums and a guest on their last two. In February 2008 the album won the Oslo Awards for album of the year 2007. The album was also voted best album of 2007 at the website Sonic Frontiers. In December 2014, Shadows of the Sun was released as a sheet music album by Raven Music Editions. All the songs, except for the Black Sabbath cover \"Solitude\", were included in the songbook."@en ;

It includes footage from their performances at larger venues such as the Red Rocks Amphitheatre and San Francisco's Warfield Theater. There are also several clips from smaller venues and impromptu settings (New York City's Central Park). Much of the concert footage highlights their appearances with other artists, including Taj Mahal, the Dirty Dozen Brass Band, Jorma Kaukonen, Merl Saunders, and Cecil \"P-Nut\" Daniels. Most of these artists are given a brief interview segment as well. Perhaps the real highlights of the film are the rare glimpses into the band's life off the road. Much attention is given to their recording in various studios (John Keane's studio, where many of their albums were recorded, bassist Dave Schools's house), time spent with artists close to the band (Vic Chesnutt, Col. Bruce Hampton), and, more importantly, one-on-one interviews with each member of the group."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"The Tragic Treasury: Songs from A Series of Unfortunate Events is the second studio album by indie pop band The Gothic Archies. It is a concept album whose songs are loosely based on the thirteen books of Daniel Handler's book series A Series of Unfortunate Events and were originally included at the end of the audiobook editions of each novel. The music, like the writing in the books themselves, is morose for comic effect. Some of the songs' lyrics have something to do with the story itself and are often implicitly written in the voice of one of the corresponding book's characters; for example, \"When You Play the Violin\" is apparently in the voice of one of the book's five orphans, most likely Klaus, while \"Dreary, Dreary\" appears to be an ode to Beatrice, Lemony Snicket's ill-fated love interest. Others' connections seem to be in name only; for example, \"Shipwrecked\", The End's song, is about a man who decapitates his ship's crew in an attempt to be shipwrecked on an island with his true love, only to discover that there is no island anywhere nearby. The album has 13 tracks, each one corresponding to the respective book of the series, plus two bonus tracks: \"Walking My Gargoyle\" (the theme originally intended to be from The Carnivorous Carnival) and \"We Are the Gothic Archies\"."@en ;

The title of which, according to Benji Madden, comes from the lyrical content of the album, which he explained: \"all is connected to the heart\". At the time, Madden also added that they had already written 20 songs for the album, and are said to be heading back to their pop punk roots. Describing the sound to MTV news, Joel Madden said \"There's nothing dance-y on the record, though, at all, which is different from our last one,\" further implying a movement away from the sound of Good Morning Revival, though some of the songs still are remniscent of it."@en ;

According to the band's bio on ATP Recordings site, \"the music captured on this material is an ethereal, resonant execution of what could be described as eastern acoustic punk. Likened to the voyeurism of Sandy Bull, Sir Richard Bishop, or Jack Rose style raga's reinterpreted at times with Drive Like Jehu, Minutemen punk velocity, other moments emotionally spiraling toward a haunting, ethereal beauty akin to Vashti Bunyan lost in the desert of a desolate western. Blending acoustic and minimal electric guitars with a multitude of percussion instrumentation, digital tabla machines, sci-fi electronics and feedback, this avant garde collective of envelope pushing splatter artists have created a new presence. Modern mantras of electric silence that fuse consciousness into a recording of vibrant, transitional material, blending geographic as well as cultural diversity. The sound of stillness amidst chaos, light below the depths, dancing full circle into the center of what could only be called Anywhere\"."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Diana Ross & the Supremes Join the Temptations is, as the title implies, a collaborative album combining Motown's two best selling groups, Diana Ross & the Supremes and the Temptations. Issued by Motown in late 1968 to coincide with the broadcast of the Supremes/Temptations TCB television special, the album was a success, reaching #2 on the Billboard 200. Originally the lead single was to have been \"The Impossible Dream\" as featured in the climax to the TV spectacular TCB. However, it was decided to release \"I'm Gonna Make You Love Me\" as a single instead even though it wasn't featured on TCB. This became a number-two hit on both the Billboard Hot 100 and the R&B charts, and the follow-up, \"I'll Try Something New\", was a Top 30 hit. A third single, \"I Second That Emotion\", was released exclusively in the United Kingdom, where it became a Top 20 hit. However, a true reflection of \"I'm Gonna Make You Love Me\"'s popularity was that it was certified platinum and was the #1 single on both Cash Box and Record World (three weeks). By rights, this should be credited as yet another #1 single for both Diana Ross and The Supremes and the Temptations. Diana Ross & the Supremes Join the Temptations marks the first on-record appearance of new Temptations lead singer Dennis Edwards, who was brought in as David Ruffin's replacement in July 1968. This was an unbelievably successful time for Motown. During December 1968, the label had 5 of the Top 10 singles in one week including \"Love Child\" by Diana Ross and The Supremes, \"Cloud Nine by the Temptations, \"I Heard it Through the Grapevine by Marvin Gaye, \"For Once in My Life\" by Stevie Wonder and, of course, \"I'm Gonna Make You Love Me by arguably the first soul/pop super group, Diana Ross and The Supremes with [the Temptations]]. Not only that, but the corresponding albums, by each individual artists ranked in the Top 10, TCB, Diana Ross & The Supremes Join the Temptations by the respective groups held down the #1 and #2 albums. \"Cloud Nine\" by the Temptations, \"Love Child\" by Diana Ross and The Supremes, For Once in My Life by Stevie Wonder, M.P.G. and Time Out by Smokey Robinson and The Miracles which featured the lightening speed growth of the soon to be Top 10 single, \"Baby, Baby Don't Cry\"."@en ;

The title of the album derives from the film Five Easy Pieces, which Cole described as \"one of my very favourite films\", saying, \"I want to write at least five songs out of that film\". Following the praise and healthy sales of their debut album Rattlesnakes the previous year, Easy Pieces became the band's fastest-selling album, selling more in its first two weeks than Rattlesnakes had managed in a whole year. It was also their highest charting album in the UK, peaking at number 5, aided by three top 40 singles. However, despite Easy Pieces' commercial success, the reception from critics was lukewarm and the band themselves were unhappy with the end result. Cole would later say, \"It strikes me that there's something really fresh on the first album which has been dragged onto the second album, and the freshness is not there and something to replace the freshness is not there either\".

The album features 18 songs of Leith's interpretations from the 1960s and 1970s that inspired and captured his spirit at a young age. \"The great songwriters of the 60s and 70s have always been a major influence on my own original material. In many ways the songs of that generation are as relevant today as they were back then. I've chosen songs that either mean a great deal to me on a personal level or those that I'd just love people to hear.\" The album debuted at number three on the Australian ARIA Albums Chart, selling 9,688 copies in its first week. In the following week, in the lead up to Mother's Day, the album rose to number two. Selling over 17,000 units, the album lost the top position by less than 300 copies."@en ;

The album is a collection of covers of \"60s psychedelic chestnuts,\u201D a reinterpretation of mostly obscure 60s psychedelia, intended by Ulver as a reflection on lost innocence. In a Kscope video interview, Kristoffer Rygg commented, \u201CI grew up with parents who were still listening to music from the time, so it informed my childhood, and it has become an ever increasing geeky sort of fetish since then.\u201C Adding, \u201CMy feeling is that most people's knowledge sort of limits itself to The Doors. The Doors were cool, but there was so much else going on\u2026 in the underground, records that got lost and didn't get as much recognition as they deserved in my opinion. We wish to be ambassadors for things that we love and we sort of hope that we can open some gates with the record.\u201D The album includes versions of songs by The Pretty Things, The Byrds, Bonniwell's Music Machine, We the People, Jefferson Airplane, Gandalf, The Electric Prunes, The 13th Floor Elevators, The Troggs, The Left Banke, The Beau Brummels, Common People, Music Emporium, Curt Boettcher, The Fleur de Lys, and The United States of America.

	dbo:abstract	"Ciara is the eponymously titled fifth studio album by American recording artist Ciara, which was released on July 9, 2013, by Sony Music Entertainment. This album is the artist's first release under Epic, since publicly asking the now-defunct Jive Records to release her from her contractual obligations. The singer cited a lack of label support and financial funding for her previous albums Fantasy Ride (2009) and Basic Instinct (2010). On this fifth studio album, Ciara is reunited with her long-term mentor and friend L.A. Reid, chairman of Epic Records. Reid is credited with discovering Ciara in 2003 along with signing her to his LaFace Records label and executive-producing her debut studio album, Goodies (2004). On Ciara, the singer is reunited with music producers Rodney Jerkins and Jasper Cameron, who have respectively worked on previous Ciara singles and albums. The duo were joined by The Underdogs, Soundz, D'Mile, Oligee, Josh Abraham and Mike Will Made It, amongst others. Writing contributions come from the likes of singer-songwriters: Wynter Gordon, Livvi Franc and Ali Tamposi, along with a number of contributions from Ciara herself. Rappers Future and Nicki Minaj respectively have guest vocals on the album, whilst Ciara herself is listed as a featured artist on the song \"Super Turnt Up\", a record where she raps and takes credit for co-producing the song. Promoting the release of this album, all three singles; including \"Sweat\" featuring 2 Chainz, \"Sorry\", and \"Got Me Good\" were released, when the album was titled One Woman Army. None of the songs impacted on the US Billboard Hot 100 and were subsequently swept aside in favor of a new single, titled \"Body Party\", which reached at number 22 on the US Billboard Hot 100 and number 8 on the US Billboard Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart. \"I'm Out\" featuring Nicki Minaj, was released as the album's second single in June 2013. \"Overdose\" was released as the album's third single, it was serviced to American Urban and Rhythmic radio in September and October 2013, respectively. Upon its release, Ciara was met with a warm reception from music critics, who complimented the album as one of the strongest in her discography, but criticized the lack of identity and lasting impression that the album makes. The album debuted at number 2 on the US Billboard 200 chart, with first-week sales of 59,000 copies, becoming her fourth top three album on the chart. As of April 2015, the album has sold 208,000 copies in the United States."@en ;

The songs are written and composed by Vilkkumaa. Considered as a fresh new release on the Finnish pop rock scene by music critics, Pitk\u00E4 ihana leikki was favorably critiqued for its imaginative lyrical content for which Vilkkumaa, according to her, partially got the inspiration from the 1980s Finnish rock band Dingo. The album debuted at number 12 on the Finnish Albums Chart, peaking third the next week, then going variably down spending there 29 weeks. Pitk\u00E4 ihana leikki has sold over 38,000 copies to date in Finland, which has granted it a gold certification. In 2000, Vilkkumaa re-released the album under the title Pitk\u00E4 ihana leikki \u2013 peltipainos (\"Sheet Metal Edition\"), with one extra song, \"Peltirumpu\"."@en ;
