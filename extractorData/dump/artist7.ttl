	dbo:abstract	"Edward Raymond \"Eddie\" Cochran (October 3, 1938 \u2013 April 17, 1960) was an American musician. Cochran's rockabilly songs, such as \"Twenty Flight Rock\", \"Summertime Blues\", \"C'mon Everybody\", and \"Somethin' Else\", captured teenage frustration and desire in the mid-1950s to the early 1960s. He experimented with multitrack recording, distortion techniques and overdubbing even on his earliest singles, and was also able to play piano, bass and drums. His image as a sharply dressed and good-looking young man with a rebellious attitude epitomized the stance of the 1950s rocker, and in death he achieved an iconic status. Cochran was involved with music from an early age, playing in the school band and teaching himself to play blues guitar. In 1954, he formed a duet with the guitarist Hank Cochran (no relation), and when they split the following year, Eddie began a song-writing career with Jerry Capehart. His first success came when he performed the song \"Twenty Flight Rock\" in the film The Girl Can't Help It, starring Jayne Mansfield. Soon afterwards, Liberty Records signed him to a big recording contract. Cochran died at age 21 after a road accident, while traveling in a taxi in Chippenham, Wiltshire, during his British tour in April 1960, having just performed at Bristol's Hippodrome theatre. Though his best-known songs were released during his lifetime, more of his songs were released posthumously. In 1987 Cochran was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. His songs have been covered by a wide variety of recording artists (see the \"Style and Influence\" section of this article for examples)."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Paul Francis Gadd (born 8 May 1944), known by the stage name Gary Glitter, is an English former glam rock singer-songwriter and musician who achieved great popular success between the early 1970s and mid-1980s. He was known for his extreme glam image of glitter suits, makeup and platform boots, and his energetic live performances. He sold over 20 million records, spent 168 weeks in the UK charts and had 21 hit singles placing him in the top 100 UK most successful chart acts. From 1997, he returned to public notice for committing sex offences, being imprisoned for possession of child pornography in 1999, and child sexual abuse and attempted rape in 2006 and 2015. After performing under the name Paul Raven in the 1960s, he first came to prominence as Gary Glitter in the glam rock era of the early 1970s, with a sustained solo UK chart run of hits including \"Rock and Roll, Parts One and Two\", \"Do You Wanna Touch Me\", \"I Love You Love Me Love\", \"I'm the Leader of the Gang (I Am)\", and \"Hello, Hello, I'm Back Again\". A slight decline in the late 1970s was followed by a successful comeback as a solo artist again from the 1980s. Between 1972 and 1995, Glitter had 26 hit singles which spent a total of 180 weeks in the UK Top 100; twelve of those reached the Top 10, with three charting at number 1. He continued to record in the 1980s and 1990s, with his 1984 song \"Another Rock n' Roll Christmas\" becoming one of the most played Christmas hits of all time. He released seven studio albums, and at least 15 greatest hits collections or live albums. In 1998, his recording of \"Rock and Roll\" was listed as one of the top 1,001 songs in music history. The mostly instrumental \"Rock and Roll, Part 2\" has been played as a popular cheering song at American sporting events for several decades. The BBC described Glitter's fall from grace as \"dramatic\" and \"spectacular\". The late 1990s saw his image become irreparably tarnished, following his 1997 arrest and 1999 conviction in the United Kingdom for possession of thousands of items of child pornography. He was also charged, but acquitted, of sexual activity with an underage girl in the 1970s. Later, Glitter faced criminal charges and deportation from several countries including Vietnam and Cambodia connected with actual and suspected child sexual abuse, after a Vietnamese court found him guilty of obscene acts with minors in 2006. He had been living in Vietnam since deportation from Cambodia on suspected child sexual abuse charges in 2002. Glitter was deported from Vietnam back to Britain at the end of his sentence, where he was placed on the Sex Offenders' Register for life. In October 2012, Glitter was arrested again as part of Operation Yewtree. He was bailed but was eventually charged, in June 2014, with historical child sex offences. On 5 February 2015, he was found guilty of attempted rape, four counts of indecent assault, and one of having sex with a girl under the age of 13 between 1975 and 1980. He was sentenced, on 27 February, to 16 years imprisonment. Formerly one of the best-loved entertainers in British music history, Glitter is now widely hated and condemned."@en ;

In the late 1930s he moved to London, where he played in dance bands led by Bert Ambrose and Teddy Joyce. He later recorded with jazz musicians such as Coleman Hawkins, Fats Waller and Benny Carter during their visits to the U.K. In 1940, during the Second World War, Chisholm signed on with the Royal Air Force and joined the RAF Dance Orchestra (known popularly as the Squadronaires), remaining in the band long after he was demobbed. He followed this with freelance work and a five-year stint with the BBC Showband (a forerunner of the BBC Radio Orchestra) and as a core member of Wally Stott's orchestra on BBC Radio's The Goon Show, for which he made several acting appearances, for example as 'Chisholm MacChisholm the Steaming Celt' in 'The Macreekie Rising of '74'. In the early 1960s, Chisholm was part of The Black and White Minstrel Show, where his act involved a significant comedy element. He was also part of the house band for the children's programmes Play School and Play Away, and had roles in the films The Mouse on the Moon (1963), The Knack ...and How to Get It (1965) and Superman III (1983). During the 1980s Chisholm continued to play, despite undergoing heart surgery; working with his own band the Gentlemen of Jazz and Keith Smith's Hefty Jazz among others, and playing live with touring artists. He was appointed an OBE in 1984. In the mid-1990s, Chisholm retired from public life suffering from Alzheimer's disease. He died in December 1997, aged 82."@en .

His style has been greatly influential and has been described as the foundation of American Primitive Guitar, a term borrowed from painting and referring mainly to the self-taught nature of the music and its minimalist style. Fahey borrowed from the folk and blues traditions in American roots music, having compiled many forgotten early recordings in these genres. He would later incorporate classical, Portuguese, Brazilian, and Indian music into his \u0153uvre. He spent many of his later years in poverty and poor health, but enjoyed a minor career resurgence with a turn towards the more explicitly avant-garde, and created a series of abstract paintings during the last years of his life. He died in 2001 from complications from heart surgery. In 2003, he was ranked 35th in the Rolling Stone \"The 100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time\" list."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"John Lees (born 13 January 1947, Oldham, Lancashire) is an English musician who founded the rock band Barclay James Harvest. Educated at Robin Hill Secondary Modern and Breeze Hill School, Lees had no formal musical education, but took up playing the guitar when he was fourteen. Lees went on to study at Oldham School Of Art, where he met Stuart 'Woolly' Wolstenholme in 1964. They played together in The Sorcerers, playing Eddie Cochran-style rock and roll, and in The Blues Keepers, before forming Barclay James Harvest in 1967. He recorded a solo album, A Major Fancy, in 1972, but the release of this was tied up when the band changed record label. It was not released until 1977. He also recorded a solo single for Polydor in 1974, a cover of The Eagles track \"Best of My Love\". In 1998, musical differences saw the members of Barclay James Harvest agree to take a sabbatical. Lees again met up with Wolstenholme and formed Barclay James Harvest Through The Eyes of John Lees, and this band became John Lees' Barclay James Harvest. Lees worked as a music technician at Crompton House Church of England High School, involved with the production of the GCSE and A Level students' music and music technology coursework from 2006 until 2012, when he retired. He was often involved in musical productions. Lees also enjoys reading, his favourite books being Graham Greene\u2019s A Burnt-Out Case, science fiction novels (especially those of Ray Bradbury) and poetry. His hobbies include photography and amateur radio. Lees currently lives in Saddleworth, a civil parish in the Metropolitan Borough of Oldham with his wife, Olwen, and they have two children, Esther Jane (born 28 July 1980) and John Joseph (who shares his father\u2019s birthday, being born on 13 January 1986), plus various pets including an African grey parrot called Fritz."@en ;

Born and raised in Taiwan, Tsai began her singing career by winning the champion at an MTV singing competition at the age of 18. Her debut album, released in 1999 and entitled 1019, was a huge success, and she quickly became a teen idol with a large teenage fanbase. Her fifth album, Magic (2003), is regarded as one of her biggest successes so far, right after her album, Dancing Diva (2006), which sold over 2.5 million copies in Asia. After several successful albums and dozens of hits, she released her latest album, Play, in 2014. Having sold more than 25 million records in Asia, Tsai is recognized as one of the best-selling artists in Asia. Her work has earned her numerous awards and accolades, including six Golden Melody Awards, an MTV Asia Award and an MTV Video Music Award. She has been acclaimed as an entrepreneur, particularly after she founded her own music production and management company Eternal in 2009.

Born in Barcelona, Padilla moved to Ibiza in 1975, taking up the DJ residency at Cafe del Mar in 1991. In 1994, he compiled the first Cafe del Mar album for the React label. The series is now in its 21st volume and has spun off several related compilations, as well as leading to the creation of the bar's own eponymous label. Padilla selected tracks for the first six, as well as the 20th Anniversary commemorative release. While several tracks of Padilla's appeared in his various compilations, it was not until 1998 that he released his first album, Souvenir, on Mercury Records label. The CD featured collaborations with several chill-out musicians, including Lenny Ibizarre and Paco Fern\u00E1ndez. His second album, Navigator, was released in 2001. The album received a Latin Grammy nomination for Best Instrumental Album. Padilla is no longer the resident DJ at Cafe del Mar, but is touring around the world. However, in November 2007 a new compilation series called Bella Musica, unrelated to Cafe del Mar, was released. In 2011, the new CD compilation \"Here Comes the Sunset\" (Volume 4) came out and after many years Padilla has been connected to another beach, this time in Italy, Fregene. In 2015 Padilla made his new album So Many Colours available for streaming through Resident Advisor before general release on International Feel. Most recently, Jose returned to BBC Radio 1's Essential Mix decks mid August 2015 for the first time in 20 years, with a very eclectic 2 hours \"Masters\" set."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Mickey Finn or occasionally Micky Finn (especially on Beat Club), (born Michael Norman Finn, 3 June 1947 \u2013 11 January 2003) was the percussionist and sideman to Marc Bolan in his band Tyrannosaurus Rex (on one album, A Beard of Stars), and later, the 1970s glam rock group, T.Rex. Often confused with other musicians by the same name, Michael Norman Finn (apart from T. Rex) only toured as a sideman in the 1960s with Hapshash and the Coloured Coat. After Bolan and T.Rex's demise, he worked as a session musician for The Blow Monkeys and The Soup Dragons. Finn was born in Thornton Heath, Surrey, England. After he joined T.Rex in late 1969, it was rumoured that Bolan had hired Finn for his good looks, and because he admired his motorcycle, rather than for his musical ability. Finn was unable to recreate the complex rhythmical patterns of his predecessor, Steve Peregrin Took, and was effectively hired as much for a visual foil for Bolan as for his drumming. The BBC news commented on this, saying \"Marc Bolan was supposed to have said of Finn: 'He can't sing... but he looks superb.'\" Mickey Finn stated, on a radio show in Denmark that he and Marc Bolan were appearing on as guest DJs, that his big influence in percussion was the prolific Master Henry Gibson from Curtis Mayfield's band. In the early 1970s, Finn's contribution as bongocero, backing vocalist, and, occasionally, bass guitarist, to Bolan's music was essential, because Tyrannosaurus Rex and T. Rex started off as a duo and Marc needed a replacement for Steve Peregrin Took. Something of a character both on and off stage, Finn was often to be seen wearing a hat (including a green bowler), a trademark that was adopted by a significant proportion of T. Rex fans. During the late 1980s and early 1990s, Finn made a handful of guest appearances with the West London rock band, Checkpoint Charlie, fronted by Mick Lexington. In 1991 he joined Croydon R'n'B band WD40, which had a fluid line-up based around his very old friend drummer Stewart Childs (the Interns) harp & vocalist Colin Goody and vocalist and guitarist Pete Robins. The band then added guitarists, percussion etc. as required but unfortunately Mickey was forced to retire after about 12 months due to failing health. A couple of live tracks survive from this line up, but are currently out of print. Mickey also was invited to play at the Marc Bolan 50th Anniversary gig organized by Mick Gray (ex T.Rex tour manager and roadie) to celebrate what would have been Marc's 50th Birthday at the Cambridge Corn Exchange on 30 September 1997 where Gray was manager. Finn returned to the mainstream music scene in 1997, fronting a new, controversial version of T. Rex, Mickey Finn's T. Rex, playing old T. Rex songs until his last days."@en ;

Initially, his work focused primarily on the use and performance of klezmer music between these two groups. Gradually, his focus increased to examining all aspects of their culture, from post-World War II to the present. He was among the first of the so-called klezmer revivalists to identify the connection between klezmer and lautare (Rom/Gypsy musicians) and explore that connection in his scholarly and artistic works. In the more than two decades since his initial ethnographic trip, Yale Strom has become one of the world's most productive and influential scholar-artists of klezmer culture and history."@en ;

An expanded 2-CD version of This is Pat DiNizio was issued in 2011. In 2000, DiNizio made an unsuccessful run for the New Jersey seat of the United States Senate, running on the Reform Party ticket. He finished 4th with 19,312 votes (0.64%). The campaign was chronicled in the 2001 documentary film Mr. Smithereen Goes to Washington. The same year, he launched the \"Living Room Tour,\" a five-month jaunt where he performed solo, by request only, in the homes of fans. The tour was a success, and he still occasionally books similar concerts for a nominal fee. In 2001, DiNizio was one of the first musicians to throw his support behind XM Satellite Radio, becoming host and program director for the XM Radio Unsigned station. He was also an inaugural member of the Independent Music Awards' judging panel to support independent artists. In 2006, he was the focus of 7th Inning Stretch, an ESPN2 reality special. The special focused on DiNizio's recovery from a \"life-threatening and debilitating nervous disorder\" by training and attempting to try out for a Minor League Baseball team (The Somerset Patriots), along with tales of baseball folklore from other musicians such as Joan Jett, Gene Simmons, and Bruce Springsteen. DiNizio also released an audio book, Confessions Of A Rock Star, and continues to perform both solo acoustic shows and with The Smithereens. From November 2011 to June 2012, DiNizio presented a condensed, live adaptation of the book (with storytelling and full band accompaniment) in nightly performances at the The Riviera Hotel & Casino in Las Vegas."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Adele Laurie Blue Adkins MBE (/\u0259\u02C8d\u025Bl/; born 5 May 1988) is an English singer-songwriter. Graduating from the BRIT School for Performing Arts and Technology in 2006, Adele was given a recording contract by XL Recordings after a friend posted her demo on Myspace the same year. In 2007, she received the Brit Awards \"Critics' Choice\" award and won the BBC Sound of 2008 poll. Her debut album, 19, was released in 2008 to commercial and critical success. It is certified seven times platinum in the UK, and double platinum in the US. An appearance she made on Saturday Night Live in late 2008 boosted her career in the US. At the 51st Grammy Awards in 2009, Adele received the awards for Best New Artist and Best Female Pop Vocal Performance. Adele released her second studio album, 21, in early 2011. The album was well received critically and surpassed the success of her debut, earning the singer numerous awards in 2012, among them a record-tying six Grammy Awards, including Album of the Year; two Brit Awards, including British Album of the Year, and three American Music Awards. The album has been certified 16 times platinum in the UK, and is the fourth best-selling album in the UK of all time. In the US it has held the top position longer than any album since 1985, and is certified Diamond. The album has sold 31 million copies worldwide. The success of 21 earned Adele numerous mentions in the Guinness Book of World Records. She is the first woman in the history of the Billboard Hot 100 to have three simultaneous top 10 singles as a lead artist, and the first female artist to simultaneously have two albums in the top five of the Billboard 200 and two singles in the top five of the Billboard Hot 100. 21 is the longest-running number one album by a female solo artist in the history of the UK and US Album Charts. In 2012, she released \"Skyfall\", which she wrote and recorded for the James Bond film of the same name. The song won an Academy Award, a Grammy Award, and a Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song. After taking a three-year break, Adele released her third studio album, 25, in 2015. It became the year's best-selling album and broke first week sales records in the UK and US. 25 was her second album to be certified Diamond in the US. The lead single, \"Hello\", became the first song in the US to sell over one million digital copies within a week of its release. In 2011 and 2012, Billboard named Adele Artist of the Year. In 2012, she was listed at number five on VH1's 100 Greatest Women in Music. Time magazine named her one of the most influential people in the world in 2012 and 2016. With sales of more than 100 million records, Adele is one of the best-selling recording artists in the world."@en ;

Once when he was performing on stage in a Durga Pooja function arranged by Bengali actor Uttam Kumar, people kept requesting more songs and this information reached his mother. She complained to Kishore Kumar that his son was singing \"filmy\" songs. Hearing that, Kishore Kumar decided to bring him to Bombay. Before that, Kishore Kumar had cast Amit as his son in two films that he produced himself, Door Gagan Ki Chhaon Mein and Door Ka Raahi (with Amit as a teenager). The song \"Aa chalke tujhe, mein leke chaloon\" was filmed with Kishore Kumar singing to his eleven-year-old son Amit Kumar. He has sung many Bollywood and regional film songs since the 1970s and was more actively singing in Indian films from 1970 to 1994 as after death of R. D. Burman in 1994, citing lack of good quality music being composed he withdrew from playback singing and concentrated on live orchestra shows since 1995 and continues to perform worldwide. In addition to singing in Hindi, has also performed in Bengali, Bhojpuri, Oriya, Assamese, Marathi, and Konkani. He has the original voice of Kishore without having any nasal touch to his voice like other Kishore clones like Kumar Sanu or Babul Supriyo and sings from stomach unlike Abhijeet but as he withdrew himself from film industry after 1994, he has been under-utilised by music directors, in spite of him having extremely good voice.

	dbo:abstract	"Clem Tholet (1948 \u2013 6 October 2004) was a Rhodesian folk singer who became popular in the 1970s for his Rhodesian patriotic songs. He reached the height of his fame during the Rhodesian Bush War. Clem was born in Salisbury, Southern Rhodesia in 1948 and began writing songs while he was an art student in Durban, South Africa. One of his first songs, Vagabond Gun was a category winner in the South Africa Music Festival in 1966. Clem later moved back to Rhodesia to work in advertising. He started singing at Rhodesia's first folk venue, The Troubadour in Salisbury's Angwa Street. While performing there, he met Sue Eccles and Andy Dillon. The three formed a trio called The Kinfolk. The group moved to South Africa, and shortly after moving to Johannesburg, Sue left the group. Clem and Andy formed a new group with Yvonne Raff, which they called The Legend Trio. This new trio began singing at the original Southern African \"Troubadour\", and were also involved in a number of SAFMA's National Folk Fests. Clem married Jean Smith (daughter of Rhodesian prime minister Ian Smith) in 1967. Clem began a solo career, recording some singles with Art Heatlie at Trutone. Mel Miller, Peter Leroy and Sylvia Stott briefly joined Clem to form a group in 1970, before Clem moved back to Rhodesia in 1971. Clem moved back and soon built up a strong following. He did a series of Rhodesian Television shows, and presented a radio program called Folk on the Rocks, which was on the air for two seasons. The name came from the folk club Clem ran at The Beverley Rocks, where it played to regular packed houses. A popular star of the annual Bless 'Em All Troop Shows, and in great demand in the Rhodesian entertainment scene, Clem recorded his first album Songs of Love & War at Shed Studios. Clem wrote and produced the album himself. The album was awarded a Gold Disc. He wrote the soundtrack and songs for the C.I.S. film What A Time and the theme song for a film honouring the wounded troopies of Rhodesia, Tsanga, Tsanga. He appeared at the 7 Arts Theatre, Harare in the first half, supporting the American comedian Shelley Berman with members of the Shed Studios band \u2013 Comprising Martin Norris, Steve Roskilly, Bothwell Nyamhondera, Tony Logan and Steve Hughes. As artistic director of the advertising agency Matthewman Banks and Tholet, he was instrumental in writing a great many and memorable music jingles for his clients. He produced a second album at Shed Studios, called Two Sides to Every Story, before moving back to South Africa. After living and working in the advertising industry for many years in Cape Town, Clem died on 6 October 2004 after having suffered from the effects of a debilitating illness for a number of years. Clem's last album, Archives was (and is) sold as a fund raiser to benefit the Flame Lily Foundation. This fund raising project seeks to provide funds for the living expenses of elderly former residents of Rhodesia / Zimbabwe living in South Africa, who have been denied their pensions by the Zimbabwe government."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"C\u00E9u (Portuguese pronunciation: [s\u025Bu]), whose full name is Maria do C\u00E9u Whitaker Po\u00E7as, is a Brazilian singer-songwriter whose first American album was released on the Six Degrees Records label in April 2007. She was born in S\u00E3o Paulo, Brazil on April 17, 1980, into a musical family, her father being a composer, arranger and musicologist. It was from her father that she learned to appreciate Brazil's classical music composers, particularly Heitor Villa-Lobos, Ernesto Nazar\u00E9 and Orlando Silva. By age fifteen she had decided to become a musician and by her late teens she had studied music theory, as well as the viol\u00E3o (nylon-stringed Brazilian guitar). Her songs reveal her many influences, which include samba, valsa, choro, soul, rhythm and blues, hip hop, afrobeat and electrojazz music. As C\u00E9u herself explained, \"I have a passion for Black culture, from Jazz divas to Afro beat. Everything comes from Africa. With Samba, I have a very strong connection to the old school that we call 'Samba de raiz' (root samba). I am a vinyl listener, so I tried to bring some of that to the CD, mixing it with modern things like rap or even 'brega', which is the newest thing in Brazil.\" In particular, she cites as influences the music of Billie Holiday, Ella Fitzgerald, Lauryn Hill, and Erykah Badu, as well as the Brazilian Jorge Ben. C\u00E9u was performing onstage with major artists and exploring the repertoire of the marchinhas (turn-of-the-century carnival music) by her late teens. Soon after that she relocated temporarily to New York City, where she had a chance meeting with fellow Brazilian musician Ant\u00F4nio Pinto, who became her flat mate while he was going through some financial difficulties. She later learned that he was actually a distant cousin, and their relationship was renewed when he teamed up with lead producer Beto Villares, composer of the musical score for the movie O Ano em Que Meus Pais Sa\u00EDram de F\u00E9rias (2007), to help her record her album. Pinto, who produced C\u00E9u's song \"Ave Cruz\" is the composer of the musical score for two Oscar Nominated films, Central Station (film) (1999) and City of God (2002). Originally issued in 2005 on the S\u00E3o Paulo-based Urban Jungle, C\u00E9u was picked up by Six Degrees/Starbucks/Hear Music in the US and UK, JVC in Japan and Harmonia Mundi in France and in the Netherlands. C\u00E9u received a Latin Grammy nomination for \u201CBest New Artist\u201D of 2006. She is also riding high on a wave of international success in France, where the influential Les Inrockuptibles recognized her as one of the top 5 musical revelations of 2005, Holland, and Italy, as well as in Canada, where she was recently the fourth highest-selling artist for the Archambault chain of music shops while simultaneously holding the number 32 slot on the pop charts.Debut album in the U.S. with Six Degrees Records as the first international artist on Starbucks' Hear Music Debut Series. Her album was received with critical praise from NPR's Morning Edition, The Associated Press, Reuters, and many more, hailing her as \"\u2026a fresh new face in the Brazilian music scene.\" Her album has sound scanned over 110,000 copies to date, making her the biggest selling Brazilian artist of 2007. C\u00E9u reached unprecedented chart numbers for a Brazilian female artist\u20141 on Billboard's Heatseekers (New Artist) Chart, 57 on the Billboard Hot 100 and 1 on Billboard's World Music charts. In 2008, C\u00E9u received a Grammy nomination for \"Best Contemporary World Music Album\" in 2008 for her debut album C\u00E9U. In 2009, her critically acclaimed second album Vagarosa reached #2 on the US Billboard's World Music charts. The album has since been nominated for a 2010 Latin Grammy Award for Best Brazilian Contemporary Pop Album. In 2010, C\u00E9u was invited by Herbie Hancock to record a version of \"Tempo de Amor\" for The Imagine Project album. In 2011, she contributed a version of the track \"It's a Long Way\" in collaboration with Apollo Nove and N.A.S.A. for the Red Hot Organization's most recent charitable album Red Hot + Rio 2. The album is a follow-up to the 1996 Red Hot + Rio. In 2012, C\u00E9u received her fourth Grammy nomination for \u201CBest Contemporary Brazilian Pop Album\u201D for her critically acclaimed third album Caravana Sereia Bloom. In 2014, she released in Brazil her first live DVD/CD entitled C\u00E9u \u2013 Ao Vivo, the concert was filmed in August 2014 in S\u00E3o Paulo and contains 15 tracks in total, including the never before released cover versions of all time classics \"Piel Canela\" and \"Mais Uma Noite de Amor\", behind the scenes footage of the band and more.

On its 1991 debut album, A Wolf in Sheep's Clothing, Dres has a smooth rhyme flow, with a dose of light humor, which gave him praise in the hip hop community. Later, his style became more serious with the release of the 1994 album: Non-Fiction. Due to the lackluster sales of their sophomore album, Dres and Mista Lawnge split up and started independent projects. In 1999, Dres released a solo album titled Sure Shot Redemption. On the cover, he is credited as Dres the Black Sheep. In 2000, the duo reunited and recorded Redlight, Greenlight (EP) and the title track of the film Once in the Life. In 2006 Dres released another solo album that was titled 8WM/Novakane. In 2009, Dres released an EP titled From the Black Pool of Genius: the Prelude in preparation for his most recent solo LP, From the Black Pool of Genius, which was released June 2010.

Son of Jay Anthony Vaquer (American guitarist, brother-in-law and former-partner of Raul Seixas) and a Brazilian singer Jane Duboc. At the age of 10 he recorded Jingles, and he learned to play guitar. He then became an actor in the C\u00E9lia Helena Theatre, performing in the musical comedy Cazas de Cazuza in 2000. After that Jay Vaquer achieved his first popular success in the same year with his first album \"Nem T\u00E3o S\u00E3o\" with the medium-size hit \"A Miragem\" (\"The Mirage\") and the second single \"Aponta de um Iceberg\". The songs only reached respectable positions on the MTV Brasil chart. But the radio stations seemed not to notice the success of the singles (probably a fault of his record label). This might have been the main reason why Jay's career did not launch then. Four years later, in 2004, Vaquer released his second album \"Vendo A Mim Mesmo\", and he gained the attention of radio stations with the hit \"Pode Agradecer\" (\"You May Thank Me\"), which granted him brief fame. In 2005, Vaquer released his third album \"Voc\u00EA N\u00E3o Me Conhece\" with the hit singles \"Cotidiano de um Casal Feliz\" and \"A Falta que a Falta Faz\". Vaquer released his fourth album Formid\u00E1vel Mundo C\u00E3o in September 2007. On 5 July, he premiered the first single of this production \"Longe Aqui\",in his official Myspace."@en .

Henderson had her first taste of success at the age of 18 when her song \"Heartbroken\", which she wrote when she was 14 about her older sister who at the time was heartbroken, was remixed by producer T2. \"Heartbroken\" reached No. 2 on the UK Singles Chart, only to be held off the top spot by X Factor winner Leona Lewis. \"Heartbroken\" remained on the number 2 spot for five consistent weeks and enjoyed 46 weeks in the UK Top 40 Singles Chart, and also became the most requested track ever on BBC Radio 1Xtra. Henderson is one of the youngest and first UK female artists of her generation to have her first single release become an equally international success when \"Heartbroken\" peaked at number 10 on the U.S. Billboard Dance Chart. She then went on to write another catchy follow-up, titled \"So Typical La La La\" which became another underground smash hit and peaked in the top 10 of the Music Weeks Commercial Pop Chart. Following her success, she then went on to become a songwriter for Sony/ATV Music Publishing UK. Henderson has written a large catalogue of songs for many UK and US artists, whilst continuing to independently release her own music through her own record company J.A Music. Her next song titled \"I'm a Pozer Zer Zer Zer\" also peaked in the top 10 of the Music Weeks Commercial Pop Chart. The single was also featured on HMV's Top Selling Dance Compilation of 2010. Whilst touring the world and gaining a spot at Canadian Music Week\u2019s biggest music festival, Henderson has been focusing on writing and working on her debut album. She recently released an EP for free download titled UK Refixxxs EP which featured some of her takes on big U.S. hits like \"Marvins Room\" and \"Headlines\" by Drake, and \"Black and Yellow\" by Wiz Khalifa. Henderson's single of 2012, \"It\u2019s Over (Can\u2019t Get My Love)\", which features provocative dance producers the Bassmonkeys, was released on 22 May 2012 and entered the U.S. Kings of Spin Radio & Airplay chart at number 1 on its first day of release to radio and is enjoying support of radio stations across the globe including France, Canada & the U.S. She is set to release another single in 2012 and will be following this with her debut album."@en .

Eddie signed with Columbia Records and released two albums including his 1986 self-titled debut, John Eddie. The first single, \"Jungle Boy\", from John Eddie peaked on Billboard at #17 Rock and #52 Hot 100. At the label's behest, his long-time band, the Front Street Runners, was replaced for the album by members of Springsteen's E Street Band. He opened for Bob Seger and The Kinks in the late 1980s but was dropped by the label early in the 1990s. He then signed with Elektra Records where he was chosen to represent Elektra on their 40th Anniversary record called Rubaiyat with his version of The Cure's \"In Between Days\" and recorded a third album, which, after a lengthy legal dispute, was never released. Since then Eddie has recorded independently and toured extensively; his career saw a resurgence when independent radio promotion person and long-time fan Michele Clark became his manager in 2000. Clark secured a record deal for Eddie with Lost Highway Records and executive produced the 2003 release of Who the Hell is John Eddie? The album subsequently produced three top 10 singles at the Triple-A Radio format. Kid Rock has covered \"Lowlife\", \"Forty\" and \"Happy New Year\" all written by John Eddie. His latest album, entitled Same Old Brand New Me, was released in February 2012, featuring 18 songs. In 2013, the song Eddie co-wrote with Brantley Gilbert, \"More Than Miles\", became a top country hit for Gilbert, peaking at No. 6 on the national country charts.

	dbo:abstract	"Leonid Soybelman (born 20 July 1966 in B\u0103l\u0163i, USSR (now Moldova)) is a Berlin-based musician and film composer of Jewish origin, leader of the band Ne Zhdali. The guitarist and singer, he also collaborated with Alec Kopyt in the \"Poza\" project, with bands Auktyon, The Billy Tipton Memorial Saxophone Quartet and many others. His musical style has roots from eastern European traditional Yiddish folk music, yet is played in more modern arrangements on the electric guitar, often accompanied by a band. His work, especially with Ne Zhdali, is well known in Russia and countries of the former Soviet Union. Originally from Moldavia, he grew up in Tallinn, USSR (now Estonia), where he founded in the late 1980s the band Ne Zhdali together with his classmate Ilya Komarov. Later Soybelman moved to Berlin, Germany and Komarov to Z\u00FCrich, Switzerland. In the 1990s they reunited with Ne Zhdali in Western Europe, continuing touring and producing new albums. As frontman of \"Kletka Red\" he performed together with Tony Buck, Andy Ex and Joe Williamson. Their album Hijacking was produced by John Zorn at his label Tzadik Records in the \"Radical Jewish Culture\" series. Soybelman composed the music for the Czech film Something like happiness (Czech: \u0160t\u011Bst\u00ED) 2005, portraying the melancholy lives of four friends who grew up together in the same block of flats in a former industrial town in northern Bohemia. The somewhat bleak backdrop of the film fits snugly with Soybelman's sombre and heartfelt music."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Michael Jeffrey Shapiro (born February 1, 1951) is an American composer and conductor. The son of a Klezmer band clarinetist, Michael Shapiro was born in Brooklyn, New York, and spent most of his high school years in Baldwin, a Long Island suburb, where he was a music student of Consuelo Elsa Clark, William Zurcher, and Rudolf Bosakowski. The winner of several piano competitions during his youth, he earned his B.A. at Columbia College, Columbia University, where he majored in English literature and concentrated in music, benefiting most\u2014according to his own assessment\u2014from some of the department\u2019s stellar musicology faculty, which, at that time, included such international luminaries as Paul Henry Lang, Denis Stevens, Joel Newman, and others. He studied conducting independently with Carl Bamberger at the Mannes College of Music in New York and later with Harold Farberman at Bard College. At The Juilliard School, where he earned his master's degree, he studied solf\u00E8ge and score reading with the renowned Mme. Ren\u00E9e Longy\u2014known to generations of Juilliard students as \u201Cthe infamous madame of dictation\u201D for her rigorous demands and classic pedagogic methods\u2014and composition with Vincent Persichetti. His most influential composition teacher, however, was Elie Siegmeister, with whom he studied privately. Since 2002 Shapiro has been the music director and conductor of the Chappaqua Orchestra in New York\u2019s Westchester County, which he conducted for the world premiere of his score for the classic 1931 film Frankenstein (directed by James Whale and starring Boris Karloff) (which has since its premiere received over twenty productions nationally) as well as for the world premiere of his own orchestral work, Roller Coaster, which received its West Coast premiere under the baton of Marin Alsop in 2010 at the Cabrillo Festival of Contemporary Music while Shapiro was a composer in residence. He served for two years as the music consultant to the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington, D.C., where he produced and performed music by a number of composers who were either murdered by the Germans and their collaborators or had survived as refugees from the Third Reich. He has also been the assistant conductor at the Zurich Opera Studio. Shapiro\u2019s works, which in the aggregate address nearly every medium, have been performed widely throughout the United States, Canada, and Europe\u2014with broadcasts of premieres on National Public Radio, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, the Israel Broadcasting Authority, Sender Freies Berlin, WQXR, and WCBS-TV. His music has been characterized in a New York Times review as \u201Cpossessing a rare melodic gift.\u201D His oeuvre includes more than one hundred works for solo voice, piano, chamber ensembles, chorus, orchestra, as well as for opera, film, and television. Shapiro has received awards and grants from Martha Baird Rockefeller Composer\u2019s Assistance, Meet the Composer, the Henry Evans Traveling Fellowship of Columbia University, and the Boris Koutzen Memorial Fund. He has also received the Columbian Award and the Sigma Alpha Iota Composers Competition prize. He is the author of Jewish Pride and of The Jewish 100, which has been published in British, Japanese, Chinese, Russian, Portuguese, Bulgarian, Polish, and Romanian editions\u2014in addition to its original American release. Shapiro has collaborated with such artists as Teresa Stratas, Jose Ferrer, Janos Starker, Sir Malcolm Arnold, John Corigliano, Marin Alsop, Sergiu Comissiona, Jerry Junkin, Eugene Drucker, Kim Cattrall, Tim Fain, Gottfried Wagner, Alexis Cole, Edward Arron, Jerome Rose, Mariko Anraku, Steven Beck, Elliott Forrest, John Fullam, Jose Ramos Santana, Clamma Dale, Anita Darian, Florence Levitt, Nina Berman, Kikuei Ikeda, Ayako Yoshida, Harris Poor, John Edward Niles, David Leibowitz, Robert Tomaro, Kathryn Amyotte, James Allen Anderson, Glen Hemberger, Anthony LaGruth, Matthew Thomas Troy, and Emily Wong, and organizations such as the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra, Houston Symphony Orchestra, Virginia Symphony Orchestra, Charleston Symphony Orchestra, West Point Band's The Jazz Knights, Dallas Wind Symphony, Springfield Symphony Orchestra, Traverse Symphony Orchestra, New York Repertory Orchestra, Rock River Symphony, Garden State Philharmonic, Opera Theatre of Northern Virginia, Piedmont Wind Symphony, Westchester Concert Singers, International Opera Center at the Zurich Opera, United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, American Jewish Committee, Hawthorne String Quartet, Locrian Chamber Ensemble, Amernet String Quartet, Artemis, Cabrillo Festival of Contemporary Music, and Dateline NBC, and universities in New York, Louisiana, Ohio, Delaware, Florida, Texas, and Tennessee."@en ;

He has been influenced by Louis Armstrong and Louis Jordan and says that the highest note he can hit on trumpet is a high C. He often accompanies his songs with his own vocals. Most of his bands perform New Orleans jazz standards, though he also composes many of his own pieces. Jon Pareles of The New York Times wrote, \"Mr. Ruffins is an unabashed entertainer who plays trumpet with a bright, silvery tone, sings with off-the-cuff charm and never gets too abstruse in his material.\""@en ;

He is also known under stage names Aggressor, Czral and Exhurtum. He has played in various black metal and avant-garde metal bands. These include Ved Buens Ende, Aura Noir, Cadaver, D\u00F8dheimsgard, Satyricon, Ulver, Infern\u00F6 and recently the jazz/rock band Virus. His drumming is unusual in style, with very little repetition and a tendency to shy away from traditional drumming. His singing abilities are diverse. Other than usual harsh vocals in black metal, he uses a form of croon in the avant-garde metal bands Ved Buens Ende and Virus. He has gone back to playing guitar and was writing music for the re-grouped Ved Buens Ende, before the band once again split up in early 2007. Beyond that, he continues to write material for Aura Noir and Virus. He was also a session drummer for Dimmu Borgir on their 1997 tour. On 26 March 2005 he fell from a four-story building and was hospitalized for several months. He has lost the use of his feet as a result of the incident. He is not able to play drums anymore, but is still active as a vocalist, guitarist and bassist."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Alice Cooper (born Vincent Damon Furnier; February 4, 1948) is an American singer, songwriter, and actor whose career spans over five decades. With his distinctive raspy voice and a stage show that features guillotines, electric chairs, fake blood, deadly snakes, baby dolls, and dueling swords, Cooper is considered by music journalists and peers alike to be \"The Godfather of Shock Rock\". He has drawn equally from horror films, vaudeville, and garage rock to pioneer a macabre and theatrical brand of rock designed to shock people. Originating in Phoenix, Arizona, in the late 1960s after he moved from Detroit, Michigan, \"Alice Cooper\" was originally a band consisting of Furnier on vocals and harmonica, lead guitarist Glen Buxton, Michael Bruce on rhythm guitar, Dennis Dunaway on bass guitar, and drummer Neal Smith. The original Alice Cooper band released its first album in 1969 but broke into the international music mainstream with the 1971 hit \"I'm Eighteen\" from their third studio album Love It to Death, which was followed by the even bigger single \"School's Out\" in 1972. The band reached their commercial peak with the 1973 album Billion Dollar Babies. Furnier adopted the band's name as his own name in the 1970s and began a solo career with the 1975 concept album Welcome to My Nightmare. In 2011, he released Welcome 2 My Nightmare, his 19th album as a solo artist and 26th album in total. In 2011, the original Alice Cooper band was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Expanding from his Detroit rock roots, Cooper has experimented with a number of musical styles, including art rock, hard rock, heavy metal, new wave, glam metal, pop rock, experimental rock, and industrial rock. Cooper is known for his social and witty persona offstage, with The Rolling Stone Album Guide calling him the world's most \"beloved heavy metal entertainer\". He is credited with helping to shape the sound and look of heavy metal, and has been described as the artist who \"first introduced horror imagery to rock'n'roll, and whose stagecraft and showmanship have permanently transformed the genre\". Away from music, Cooper is a film actor, a golfing celebrity, a restaurateur, and, since 2004, a popular radio DJ with his classic rock show Nights with Alice Cooper."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Andrea Bocelli, OMRI, OMDSM (Italian pronunciation: [an\u02C8dr\u025B\u02D0a bo\u02C8t\u0283\u025Blli]; born 22 September 1958) is an Italian classical crossover tenor, recording artist, and singer-songwriter. Born with poor eyesight, he became permanently blind at the age of 12 following a football accident. Bocelli has recorded fifteen solo studio albums, of both pop and classical music, three greatest hits albums, and nine complete operas, selling over 80 million records worldwide. He has had success as a crossover performer bringing classical music to the top of international pop charts. In 1998, he was named one of People's 50 Most Beautiful People. In 1999, he was nominated for Best New Artist at the Grammy Awards. \"The Prayer\", his duet with Celine Dion for the animated film Quest for Camelot, won the Golden Globe for Best Original Song and was nominated for an Academy Award in the same category. With the release of his classical album, Sacred Arias, Bocelli captured a listing in the Guinness Book of World Records, as he simultaneously held the top three positions on the US Classical Albums charts. Seven of his albums have since reached the top 10 on the Billboard 200, and a record-setting ten have topped the classical crossover albums charts in the United States. With five million units sold worldwide, Sacred Arias became the biggest-selling classical crossover album by a solo artist of all time, and with over twenty million copies sold worldwide, his 1997 pop album Romanza became the best-selling album by an Italian artist of any genre in history, as well as the best-selling album by a foreign artist in Canada and a number of countries in Europe and Latin America. The album's first single, \"Time to Say Goodbye\", was a duet with Sarah Brightman that topped charts across Europe, including Germany, where it stayed at the top of the charts for fourteen consecutive weeks, breaking the all-time sales record, with over three million copies sold in the country. The single went on to sell over twelve million copies worldwide, making it one of the best-selling singles of all time. Bocelli was made a Grand Officer of the Order of Merit of the Italian Republic in 2006 and, on 2 March 2010, was honoured with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for his contribution to Live Theater."@en ;
