He graduated at the University of Z\u00FCrich in Mathematics, Theoretical Physics and Crystallography and completed his PhD in Mathematics in 1971. In 1980, he habilitated in Algebraic Geometry and Representation Theory. In 2000, he was awarded the medal of the Mexican Mathematical Society. In 2003, he habilitated in Computational Science at the University of Z\u00FCrich. Mazzola has recorded several Free Jazz CDs with musicians like Mat Maneri, Heinz Geisser, Sirone, Jeff Kaiser, Scott Fields, Matt Turner and Rob Brown. Mazzola is well known for his application of sophisticated mathematical concepts such as topos theory to music theory, described in his book The Topos of Music. The result has been somewhat controversial, drawing praise from some mathematicians and music theorists (among others: Alexander Grothendieck (Das ist wohl schon die Mathematik des neuen Zeitalters, This is probably already the mathematics of the new age), Yuri Manin, Yves Andr\u00E9, Fran\u00E7ois Nicolas, Thomas Noll), and dissent from others (among others: Dmitri Tymoczko (If you can't learn algebraic geometry, he sometimes seems to be saying, then you have no business trying to understand Mozart.)). Currently he is Professor at the School of Music at the University of Minnesota. Since 2007 he is the president of the Society for Mathematics and Computation in Music."@en ;

Goodman had continuing troubles with Finnish tax authorities and had ever-worsening problems with alcohol. His escapades were eagerly followed by sensationalist magazines such as Hymy. Goodman died of a heart attack while on the way from Vyborg to Hamina, Finland. The story of his life was turned into a feature film, Rentun Ruusu, in 2001. Irwin's most famous songs include \"Poing Poing Poing\" (1971), \"Haistakaa Paska Koko Valtiovalta\" (1976), \"Rentun Ruusu\" (1988), \"Ei Tippa Tapa\" (1966), \"Ty\u00F6miehen lauantai\" (1965), \"En Kerro Kuinka Jouduin Naimisiin\" (1965) and \"Tytt\u00F6 Tuli\" (1978). He won the Syksyn S\u00E4vel song contest twice. Common themes on his songs were poverty, taxes, drinking and alcoholism (\"Ei tippa tapa\", \"Viel\u00E4 yhdet\", \"Kieltolaki\", \"Homma k\u00E4y\", \"Ty\u00F6miehen lauantai\", \"Rentun ruusu\") and problems with money (\"Raha ratkaisee\", \"Kun ei rahat riit\u00E4\", \"Meni rahahommat pieleen\", \"Manu vippaa muutama markka\"). He protested the government with songs like \"Juhlavalssi,\" and \"Haistakaa paska koko valtiovalta\". In 1971, Irwin released an album featuring actor Esa Pakarinen. His 1972 album Kohta taas on joulu consists of Christmas carols. The later songs (\"Suruton nuoruusaika\", \"Maailma on kaunis\", \"Ai, ai, ai, kun nuori ois\" and \"Viimeinen laulu\") were often dark when compared to songs from the 1960s and 1970s."@en .

	dbo:abstract	"J.P. (John Paul) Cormier (born January 23, 1969), is a Canadian bluegrass/folk/Celtic singer-songwriter and multi-instrumentalist. To date he was won thirteen East Coast Music Awards and one Canadian Folk Music Award. Cormier was born in London, Ontario and began playing guitar around age five. As a child he displayed an unusual ability to play a variety of instruments by ear and won a guitar contest at age nine. Appearances on Up Home Tonight, a television show devoted to bluegrass music, followed at age fourteen. Cormier has stated that he learned to play guitar by listening to such noted country / bluegrass musicians as Chet Atkins and Doc Watson. Other instruments J.P. has played on his albums include fiddle, twelve string guitar, upright bass, banjo, mandolin, drums, percussion, synthesizer, cello, tenor banjo and piano. By age sixteen Cormier had recorded his first album (a collection of bluegrass instrumentals) and he began working the U.S. festival circuit. This led him to move to the United States and to begin working as a session musician. He continued to perform live on the festival circuit and at the Grand Ole Opry with country artists Waylon Jennings, Marty Stuart, Earl Scruggs, Bill Monroe and others. In 1989 he attended the now-named Northeast Mississippi Community College in Booneville, Mississippi, where he majored in music education. At the time it was one of only three colleges in North America that offered a specialty in bluegrass instruments. During his stay at Northeast he began playing the dobro and piano. It was also during this time he first had the idea for the song \"Northwind\". Cormier was involved in a serious truck accident in 2009, resulting in a fractured vertebra and a halt to his touring in 2012. He went back into the studio, focused on his singer-songwriter abilities, and released Somewhere In The Back of My Heart in the same year. In April 2015 Cormier released a new album, The Chance, which included the previously released single Hometown Battlefield, about soldiers experiencing posttraumatic stress disorder. The song, inspired by Cormier's 2007 Afghanistan tour and news about soldiers' suicides, went viral, with millions of Facebook visits and 800,000 YouTube views (July 2015)."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Karen Clark-Sheard (born Karen Valencia Clark; November 15, 1960) is an American gospel four-time Grammy Award winning singer, musician, and songwriter. The youngest daughter of pioneering gospel choral director Mattie Moss Clark, Sheard began her career as a member of the Grammy-Award winning, gospel legendary female group, The Clark Sisters. She is the mother of contemporary gospel singer and actress Kierra \"Kiki\" Sheard. During the hiatus of the Clark Sisters, Sheard rose to fame after she recorded her critically acclaimed and much anticipated solo album Finally Karen, which spawned her hit, \"Balm in Gilead\" (a re-recording of a song she originally recorded as part of The Clark Sisters back in the 1980s for their Heart & Soul album) the R&B-flavored \"Just For Me\" and \"Nothing Without You\" - a contemporary duet with R&B diva Faith Evans. Finally Karen became one of the most successful gospel albums of 1998 earning Sheard a Grammy nomination and earning her a Soul Train Lady of Soul Award for \"Best Female Vocalist\". After her debut album success and much touring, Sheard was hospitalized in 2001 after one of her blood vessels burst during a minor surgery, resulting in doctors giving her a 2% chance of survival. Her testimony inspired the title name for her long-awaited sophomore project, Second Chance released in 2002, featuring a \"Secret Place\" - which is now considered a classic amongst fans. Sheard recorded two more live albums, including The Heavens Are Telling and It's Not Over (which featured some studio recordings), before releasing All in One, Sheard's first all-studio-recorded album in 13 years. The album debuted at #3 on the U.S. Billboard Gospel Chart and #98 on Billboard's Top 200 albums chart, while its first single \"Prayed Up\" has so far peaked at #10 on the U.S. Billboard Gospel Songs chart. Sheard is in talks to play Kitty Parham (a member of The Famous Ward Singers) in Aretha Franklin's upcoming biopic. Sheard released her latest single \"Sunday A.M\" in 2014, which is nominated for the Best Gospel Song in the 57th Annual Grammys."@en ;

He is often credited under his pseudonym, Necrolord. W\u00E5hlin's interest in art began while attending Schillerska Grammar School, a secondary educational institution in central Gothenburg. He has referenced Romantic and Renaissance painters like Caspar David Friedrich, Albrecht D\u00FCrer and Hieronymus Bosch as early influences. This interest also coincided with the time in which he studied music. At the age of 17, W\u00E5hlin formed Grotesque (as guitarist) with school friend Tomas Lindberg on vocals, Alf Svensson on guitar, and Tomas Eriksson on drums. The 1990 break-up of Grotesque would lead to the formation of At the Gates, who would be credited as instigators of the \"Gothenburg Melodic death metal sound\". W\u00E5hlin would collaborate with Lindberg and other At the Gates members a short time additionally in the death metal band Liers in Wait, and would go on to design the \"Russian icon\" cover-art of At the Gates' cornerstone release, Slaughter of the Soul. Dissection, who shared practice quarters with At the Gates, would display illustrations by W\u00E5hlin on the cover of The Somberlain and also Storm of the Light's Bane; the latter featuring the infamous scene of the \"grim reaper horseman\" in the middle of a snow-covered forest tundra. In the Nightside Eclipse, the debut of seminal Norwegian black metal band Emperor, would also be graced with his work on the cover. W\u00E5hlin would continue as an album artist for several other bands in the European death, black, doom, power and gothic metal collective throughout the 2000s. Liers in Wait and Decollation would feature musical contribution by W\u00E5hlin before both groups folded in the mid-1990s.

	dbo:abstract	"Llu\u00EDs Llach i Grande (Catalan pronunciation: [\u028Eu\u02C8iz \u02C8\u028Eak]) (born 7 May 1948 in Verges, Catalonia, Spain) is a Catalan composer and singer-songwriter. He is one of the main representatives of Nova can\u00E7\u00F3 (New Song), a movement of musicians, and singers who defied Francisco Franco's dictatorship by singing political songs in Catalan during a time where the language, and all other cultural manifestations of Catalan identity were prohibited. His famous song L'Estaca about a rotten stick about to fall was clear enough as an image of the regime. As many other singers, writers and politically involved artists, Llach left Spain and lived in voluntary exile in Paris until the death of the dictator. Though partially dependent on arrangers, like Manel Camp or Carles Cases in his early works, Llach's songwriting has largely evolved from the more basic early compositions to a vastly more complex harmonic and melodic writing. Self-taught as a guitarist, Llach only strums simple chords on guitar. As a pianist, he shows a good knowledge of the European song tradition from Schubert to Hahn with touches of Satie (Nounou) and his local imitators like Mompou and Manuel Blancafort (A la taverna del mar). Llach has used salsa piano patterns (Terra) and jazzy whole-step block modulations (El jorn dels miserables) and progressions (Can\u00E7\u00F3 d'amor a la llibertat). Some early songs depicted some inspiration from Baroque dances (Laura, Jo s\u00E9, Vinyes verdes vora el mar) and ostinato chord patterns (Non, Somniem).Among his influences as singer, Llach has recognized Mahalia Jackson and Jacques Brel. His lyrics can range from the most traditionally romantic songs, to more complex, philosophical song-cycles and also to some more ironic, politically based compositions, with a more upbeat tempo. Sea and vitalistic attitude in face of death are two of his cherished topics. When he doesn't write the lyrics of his songs he puts music to a variety of poets, including Constantine P. Cavafy, M\u00E0rius Torres, Josep Maria de Segarra, Pere Quart and, perhaps more often than with any of the others, Miquel Mart\u00ED i Pol. Llach has occasionally performed as a classical baritone, including a series of performances of Gabriel Faur\u00E9's Requiem, and has also been a wine producer. He marked his retirement as front man in music with a farewell concert in Verges (March 2007), in Baix Empord\u00E0 on the Costa Brava, the village in which he grew up. Afterwards, he has performed incidental music for theatre pieces. His 1968 song L'Estaca has become an anthem of the Catalan independence movement, regularly sung by crowds at demonstrations."@en ;

Born August 18, 1976 in Wetzlar, Germany, Mootz served an apprenticeship in classical music and was a member of the boy's choir of Windsbach. After studying music engineering at the SAE Institute, Mootz worked with the experimental hip hop/illbient label Chrome, an offshoot of Force Inc Music Works. Over the course of several drum and bass albums and many singles, and as A&R manager for Chrome, later renamed Position Chrome, Panacea became known for pushing the bounds of the drum and bass genre into industrial and hardcore territory, and for energetic DJ sets which fused these genres in a live setting. With his side project m2, he explored a more minimal side of electronic music, first in the realm of clicks 'n' cuts, and later in the dark ambient territory pioneered by the likes of Lustmord.

Hindert grew up in Falls Church, Virginia, where his identical twin, Bryan, plays bass guitar in a local indie surf rock band. He is actually a guitar player and ukulele lover who learned the bass guitar to join the Bravery, a multi-instrumentalist. Before the band took off, Hindert worked as a waiter and delivery boy on St. Marks' \"Yaffa Cafe\". Hindert was nicknamed \"Dirt\" by his fellow band mates, due to the confusion of there being two Mikes in the band. Instead of being called Hindert, they called him Dirt for short. Hindert was also known as mike burrito hinder- his alter ego was known as a drunken mess at times. He frequently wore distinctive eyeshadow, a rockabilly styled pompador and a retro 1950s styled greaser wardrobe or no clothing at all. Hindert's wardrobe has now toned down significantly. Hindert's style and personality to date, has evolved into a somber, clean cut, mature 1960s mod conservative skinny tie-black suit combination. The Bravery played at the Glastonbury Festival on June 26, 2005, following a year of success and increasing popularity. Their set was due to be broadcast live on BBC Three in the daytime, but had to be shown well after the watershed, as Hindert stripped naked on stage because of the hot weather. Recently, Hindert has launched a record company, Merrifield Records ."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Michael James Owen Pallett (born September 7, 1979) is a Canadian composer, violinist, keyboardist, and vocalist, who performs solo as Owen Pallett or, before 2010, under the name Final Fantasy. As Final Fantasy, he won the 2006 Polaris Music Prize for the album He Poos Clouds. From the age of 3, Pallett studied classical violin, and composed his first piece at age 13. A notable early composition includes some of the music for the game Traffic Department 2192; he moved on to scoring films, to composing two operas while in university. Apart from the indie music scene, he has had commissions from the Barbican, Toronto Symphony Orchestra, National Ballet of Canada, Bang on a Can, Ecstatic Music Festival, the Vancouver CBC Orchestra, and Fine Young Classicals. On his Final Fantasy releases, Pallett has collaborated with Leon Taheny, who is credited as drummer and engineer. Following the release of Heartland, Pallett has toured with guitarist/percussionist Thomas Gill and more recently with his former collaborators in Les Mouches, Rob Gordon and Matt Smith. Pallett has been noted for his live performances, wherein he plays the violin into a loop pedal. Pallett uses Max/MSP and SooperLooper to do multi-phonic looping, which sends his violin signal to amplifiers across the stage. In January 2014, Pallett and William Butler were nominated for Best Original Score at the 86th Academy Awards for their work on Her."@en ;

Pam Ann nickname generally, as most of her shows are based on the airlines related topics humor. The name itself is a play on words from Pan Am. In her shows, she refers to the so-called memories of the \"Golden Age of Aviation\" (for her, the period between the late 1950s and early 1970s when the jet airplanes entered widespread use), often contrasting it with modern times, and visual/social changes like the lack of knives and glass on the board. Overall, she also plays with the stereotypical views of airlines, like Virgin Airlines with model-nymphomaniacs, Alitalia with \"they think they are all driving Ferrari\". Also generally she has at least \"peek inside\" into the current aviation industry, like commenting accidents or airline retakes."@en .

Along with being a solo artist, he has also worked with guitarist Pedro Joia. Hailing from the state of Maranh\u00E3o, in northeastern Brazil, Zeca - short for Jos\u00E9 (his name is Jose Ribamar) - grew up with music. He then went to a university to study Agronomy and was given the nickname \"Baleiro\" (\"candyman\"), because of his love for candy.

	dbo:abstract	"Zlatan Stipi\u0161i\u0107 Gibonni (born 13 August 1968) is a Croatian singer, musician and composer from Split. Born in a family with a strong musical tradition (his father, Ljubo Stipi\u0161i\u0107, was a well-known composer), Zlatan Stipi\u0161i\u0107, who later embraced the nickname Gibonni, began his career in the 1980s with the heavy metal band Osmi putnik. After the group disbanded, Stipi\u0161i\u0107 joined Divlje jagode, recording few demo tapes before disbanding. It was Zele Lipova\u010Da, the lead guitarist of Jagode, who gave Stipi\u0161i\u0107 the nickname Gibonni. Gibonni started his solo career in the 1990s with songs that combined elements of rock, modern pop and Dalmatian folk songs. He soon created a huge following, especially among Croatian youth. Gibonni's popularity continued to grow beyond Croatia and he is currently one of the most popular and influential musicians in the territories of former Yugoslavia. Gibonni wrote the song \"Cesarica\" for Oliver Dragojevi\u0107, which became one of Oliver's signature hit songs and one of the most popular and well known songs in Croatia. In 2003 Zlatan Stipi\u0161i\u0107 was appointed a UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador. He is involved in many humanitarian concerts and organizations fighting hunger and poverty.Gibonni has three children: daughter Tanja was born in 1996 and son Rando was born in 1998. It is believed that his name Rando (short from 'random') comes from Gibonni's indeterminacy to give him a name. That indeterminacy is shown again in August 2005, when his third child was born, and had no name for several months, until finally he was given the name Lorenzo. Gibonni released his long awaited and critically appraised album Unca fibre in May 2006 after a five-year period following his award-winning album Mirakul. In 2010 he released the album Toleranca, and in 2013, he released 20th Century Man, sung entirely in English. This album was used partially as a fundraiser for SOS children's village. In 2016, Gibonni released the Album Familija, which was made in collaboration with Oliver, featuring 10 tracks. Soon afterwards, Gibonni released his Best of Collection consisting of his most popular songs, including some from his early 90s career."@en ;

Shevchuk was born in Yagodnoye in Magadan Oblast and raised in Ufa, Bashkir ASSR, though he now resides in St. Petersburg, Russia. Shevchuk was an art teacher before founding DDT. He is best known for his distinctive gravelly voice. His lyrics detail aspects of Russian life with a wry, humanistic sense of humor. He is also very famous for openly opposing pop music. He is often accredited with being the greatest songwriter in present-day Russia. In January 1995, during First Chechen War, Shevchuk went on a peace mission to Chechnya, where he performed 50 concerts for both Russian troops and Chechen citizens alike. In 1999 Shevchuk visited Yugoslavia with concerts in protection of its integrity, sharply criticized USA for bombing of the sovereign state and shot some reports about destroyed Orthodox churches in the Serbian region of Kosovo for UNESCO. In 2000's Shevchuk was highly critical of the undemocratic society that has developed in Vladimir Putin's Russia (see: Putinism). On 3 March 2008 he participated in a Dissenters March in Saint Petersburg against the president elections where no real opposition candidates were allowed to run.One of his controversial songs, \"Kogda zakonchitsya neft\", has the lyrics \"When the oil runs dry, our president will die\". On 24 and 26 September 2008 he organized two peace concerts in Moscow and Saint Petersburg as a protest to the Russian-Georgian war. The name of the concert \"Don't Shoot\" was taken from his song \"Ne Strelyai\" that he had written in 1980 as a response to the Soviet war in Afghanistan. Together with his band DDT he performed with both Ossetian and Georgian musicians as well as the Ukrainian band Bratya Karamazovy that he called peacekeepers. Parts of the profits from the concerts were given to those who had suffered from the war, both Ossetians and Georgians. On 25 August 2010 Shevchuk performed the Bob Dylan song \"Knockin' on Heaven's Door\" together with U2 at the Luzhniki Stadium in Moscow, the band's first ever concert in Russia.

Wiles is well known for concocting interesting gizmos and gadgets. He made a hobby out of collecting electronic music gear since his early teen years, which inspired his nickname. He has been an avid producer on the electronic music and breakbeat scenes since the mid-90s, playing at early raves. His first show as \u00DCberzone was for DJ Sharpe at the Edge in Ft. Lauderdale, Florida. Wiles has produced many popular 12-inch singles which have appeared on many DJ compilation albums, including \"Botz,\" his first EP released on indie dance label \"City Of Angels\" in 1995, and Space Kadet EP following year in 1996 (containing Botz, Moondusted, The Brain and others). In 1999 he collaborated with Afrika Bambaataa from Soul Sonic Force on the electro breaks driven anthem \"2 Kool 4 Skool\". He has also toured extensively with such acts as The Crystal Method. His debut album Faith In The Future was released on Astralwerks in 2001. Two mix CDs followed, 2002's The Digital Mix (Moonshine) and 2004's Uberzone Y4K (Distinctive Breaks). Wiles' latest album, Ideology, was released on Nitrus/Equation records on July 31, 2007. He has also been featured in the documentary Better Living Through Circuitry. \u00DCberzone's album Ideology has been met with good reviews: DJ Magazine, September 2007 4\u00BD stars - Album of the Issue! BijouBreaks.com, July 2007\"Clearly pushing the boundaries and quality of electronic music to a whole new level. In a world where much EDM-oriented music is converging to a point where many producers are trying to achieve a similar sound or style, Uberzone has managed to shine and stand apart from the rest, while managing to keep things both superbly fun and definitely danceable.\""@en ;

Koyuncu recorded songs in a number of languages spoken along the northeastern Black Sea coast of Turkey, as well as the language of Laz.

He died during treatment for lung cancer in 2005. Although strongly denied by Health Minister Recep Akda\u011F, it is popularly thought that the Chernobyl disaster was the cause of Koyuncu's cancer, a sentiment shared by many locals on Turkey's Black Sea coast.

Chan attended Markville Secondary School in Markham, Ontario. In 2005, his musical talent was discovered in Hong Kong and is now signed with Sony Music. He has currently released six albums and one EP, titled First Experience, First Experience: Collectors Edition, Change, Close Up(EP), Can't Be Half, Put On, Quinquennium, Lost and Found and most recently, The Next Moment. Chan entered the music industry by the help of his friend Marco, who sent his previous competition demo to Sony BMG Hk. After Sony BMG received the demo they thought that he was very talented and called him for an interview. After the interview Chan signed a contract with Sony BMG (today Sony Music) and began his music career. Previously Chan was working as a hair washer at a local Toronto salon. His previous ambition was to become a full-time hair stylist. Chan's most popular songs are: \"I Miss You\", \"I Will Be Loving You\", \"\u4F60\u779E\u6211\u779E\" (You Deceive, I Deceive) and \"\u62CD\u4E00\u534A\u62D6\" (Half Dating). These are all slow love ballads and the biggest part of Chan's songs are in the same category. Chan often mentions that his voice is matched to sing slow sad love songs. But for his recent album \"Can't Be Half\": Chan said he wanted to try a new challenge: to sing a few fast songs. The decision gave him two fast songs: \"\u6700\u5F8C\u7684\u64C1\u62B1\" (the last hug), which is a Japanese rock cover of Mr.Mrs, and \"Imaginary Love\" written by \"Fiona Fung\"."@en ;

Hammond, referring to his vibes playing, called him an \"Astonishing artist, second only to Lionel Hampton in proficiency\". Paul Edward Miller (no relation), former music critic, writer and editor of Esquire Jazz Books, called Max Miller \"A Champion of Good Jazz\". The Who's Who of Jazz by John Chilton listed him as one of the leading figures on the Chicago jazz scene for many years. The jazz critic George Hoefer wrote in 1946: \"There is no doubt that Max Miller is creating something new in jazz. Keep an ear cocked towards Max Miller at the piano.\" Though it covered over 40 years from 1927 to 1970, his career peak came in the 1940s and 50s. Many of his own compositions utilized extended chord harmonies, polyphony, and polytonality and were influenced by Stravinsky, Bart\u00F3k and Hindemith."@en ;

In 1940 he moved to California, where he became a business partner of Johnny Otis, performed in Otis's band and opened the famous Barrelhouse Club with him. He played an important role in the early career of Charles Brown and was Redd Foxx's business manager. it has been widely reported that Ali was born September 23, 1910, or in 1906, in Mississippi.However, his older brothers and sister were born in New Orleans, Louisiana, to Ella Blackman, a new Orleans native, and Moksad Ali, an immigrant from Hooghly, in the Indian state of Bengal. There were several children born to this union. Two of the older sons moved to Galveston, Texas, but Ella moved to the Bronx, New York, with her other children and her sister Fanny. In New York City, Bardu (originally spelled Bahadur) fell in love with acting and music. He got involved with the Black cinema in the late 1920s and 1930s. He eventually became the front man for Chick Webb. When Webb died, Ali formed his own band and moved to Los Angeles with his wife, Tila.

Classically trained, he played keyboards for an early incarnation of the Canadian gothic/synthpop band Psyche, as well as a band called Water, who opened for Skinny Puppy in 1985. He joined Skinny Puppy during the recording of Mind: The Perpetual Intercourse (mid-1986) when he was recruited to take Wilhelm Schroeder's place. Goettel would come to be cEvin Key's primary partner in forming Skinny Puppy's music until the album The Process, as well as in their side projects Doubting Thomas, Cyberaktif, The Tear Garden and Hilt. Despite being best known for playing keyboards and synthesizers with Skinny Puppy, his first instrument was the trumpet, which he played in his high school band, before moving to Edmonton, where he began learning piano and became involved with the local music scene. He was also a competent drummer, guitarist and bassist. Goettel formed Subconscious Records in 1993 to release a 12\" single (split with friend Phil Western) under the pseudonym Duck. During the following year, the frustrations of recording The Process led to the formation of Download with Key, Western and Mark Spybey during improvisations during late-night jam sessions. Goettel died of a heroin overdose in a bathroom at his parents' home in Edmonton, Alberta on August 23, 1995. As a bandmate told Rolling Stone magazine, Goettel had just returned to his parents' house to kick his habit. Download's first album Furnace and Skinny Puppy's album The Process were both released dedicated to his memory. While in the band Psyche, he was recruited by guitar player Maury Duchamp to join a band called Voice that was formed with the remnants of the band Office, singer Malcolm Swann and bass player Jeff Sawatzky with the addition of drummer Sherri Leigh Iwaschuk, formerly with the Reverb Angels. Voice recorded a 4 song E.P. for Switch records in 1985 called 'anno di Voce' and performed on a battle of the bands TV show that aired on CBC. Voice survived for a few years in the mid-eighties and gained significant popularity in Alberta. Water was a side project during the Voice years that Dwayne formed with a singer, Mandy Cousins."@en ;

A native of California, she met and married John Phillips in San Francisco as a teenager, and went on to co-found the vocal group the Mamas & the Papas in 1965. The band rose to fame with their popular singles \"California Dreamin'\" and \"Creeque Alley,\" both of which Phillips co-wrote. They released five studio albums before their dissolution in 1970. Phillips is the last surviving member of the group. After the breakup of the Mamas & the Papas and her divorce from John Phillips, she successfully transitioned into acting, earning a Golden Globe nomination for her performance as Billie Frechette in the critically acclaimed crime biopic Dillinger (1973). She went on to appear in numerous films throughout the 1970s and 1980s, including Ken Russell's Valentino (1977), playing Natacha Rambova; Bloodline (1979); and Scissors (1991). She was also a main cast member on the series Knots Landing from 1987 to 1993. Phillips released one solo album, Victim of Romance, in 1977."@en ;

Early in his career he played clarinet and saxophones, but he eventually focused solely on clarinet. With a highly individualistic and spontaneous clarinet style that \"defied classification\", Russell began his career playing Dixieland jazz, but throughout his career incorporated elements of newer developments such as swing, bebop and free jazz. In the words of the poet Philip Larkin, \"No one familiar with the characteristic excitement of his solos, their lurid, snuffling, asthmatic voicelessness, notes leant on till they split, and sudden passionate intensities, could deny the uniqueness of his contribution to jazz.\""@en ;

Allegedly, he tuned the strings of his bass guitar, in order from lowest to highest, D E A D, to match the name of the band. He stopped playing music in 1995 after the band broke up as the result of developing tendinitis in both hands. Schulthise visited Yugoslavia while on tour with the Milkmen and became fascinated with Serbia, its culture and people. After the band disbanded, he enrolled at Indiana University to study Serbo-Croatian language, literature, and history. He moved to Serbia for work and study in 1998, but in the wake of the NATO bombing campaign there he was forced to return to the US. In late 2003, he told an interviewer that his favorite bassists were Mike Mills (R.E.M.), Johnny Gayden (Albert Collins Band) and Charles Mingus. Schulthise committed suicide by a drug overdose on March 10, 2004, at age 47."@en ;

G\u00E5s-Anders got his derogatory nickname as a child when he worked as a goose herder at a mansion house in Gamla Uppsala. As he grew up he never used the name G\u00E5s-Anders, and it was not until the 1920s that folk musicians started referring to him by that name, which was by now used as a positive epithet rather than a slur. Although G\u00E5s-Anders made his living by working as a day labourer at the farms around Bj\u00F6rklige, he was known as a poor worker who usually brought his fiddle with him and played rather than worked. As a spelman he was very popular and extremely skilled, and it was said that nobody could sit still when he played dancing music \u2013 not even he himself. As he played he would jump around, dancing on chairs and tables. Rumour had it that N\u00E4cken had taught him to play, signing a contract in blood on human bones from the churchyard. According to the stories, G\u00E5s-Anders played the polska he had learnt from N\u00E4cken on his death bed, after which all four strings on his fiddle broke and he was able to die in peace. Another story had it that G\u00E5s-Anders's wife once put a Bible on top of his fiddle, and after that it would never stay tuned. G\u00E5s-Anders left a legacy of folk music, upwards of 150 different melodies; both tunes he himself had written and those he had learnt from other fiddlers. Most of the tunes are eighth-note polskas. Since fiddlers at the time played by ear, not from written music (something which is true for traditional folk musicians today as well), much of G\u00E5s-Anders's music was never saved for posterity. Towards the end of his life he got rather deaf and had to bring a helper to tune his fiddle, but he kept playing at weddings and dances up until the final years of his life. He was a poor man when he died, and was buried in the communal part of the churchyard in Bj\u00F6rklinge. The exact location of his grave in the churchyard is unknown. In 1944, a statue of G\u00E5s-Anders, created by the sculptor Bror Hjorth, was erected next to Bj\u00F6rklinge church."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Elizeth Moreira Cardoso (sometimes listed as Elizete Cardoso) (Rio de Janeiro, July 16, 1920 \u2013 May 7, 1990), was a singer and actress of great renown in Brazil. Born in Rio de Janeiro, her father was a serenader who played guitar, and her mother was an amateur singer. Elizete began working at an early age and between 1930 and 1935 was a store clerk and hairdresser among other things. She was discovered by Jacob do Bandolim at her 16th birthday party, to which he was brought by her cousin Pedro, a popular figure among the musicians of the day. Jac\u00F3 took her to R\u00E1dio Guanabara where, in spite of her father\u2019s initial opposition, she appeared on the Programa Suburbano with Vicente Celestino, Araci de Almeida, Moreira da Silva, Noel Rosa and Mar\u00EDlia Batista on August 18, 1936. The week after she was hired by the station to appear on a weekly program. Following this, she continued to perform on various shows with multiple radio stations. In the 1960s she had her own radio show. Due to her low pay, in 1939 she began to perform at clubs, movie theaters and other venues. She met with considerable success and her popularity increased significantly. In 1950, thanks to the support of Ataulfo Alves, she recorded Bra\u00E7os vazios (Acir Alves and Edgard G. Alves) and Mensageiro da saudade (Ataulfo Alves and Jos\u00E9 Batista), but the album was unsuccessful. Her next recording, also in 1950, met with popular approval. The album included Can\u00E7\u00E3o de amor (Chocolate and Elano de Paula), and the samba Complexo (Wilson Batista). The great success of Can\u00E7\u00E3o de amor led her, in 1951, to appear on the first television program in Rio de Janeiro on TV Tupi and helped launch her film career. She appeared in Cora\u00E7\u00E3o materno, by Gilda de Abreu, and Watson Macedo\u2019s \u00C9 fogo na roupa. In 1958, Cardoso was invited by Vinicius de Moraes to be the singer of an album of songs written by himself and Tom Jobim. Can\u00E7\u00E3o do Amor Demais became the first album of bossa nova music, launching the new genre. The album was released on the Festa label. While Cardoso was not primarily considered a bossa nova singer, she is the vocalist on the original version of the bossa classic Manh\u00E3 de Carnaval from the Orfeu Negro soundtrack. Elizete continued to sing and act with great success until her death. By the end of her life she had released well over 40 albums in Brazil, Portugal and other countries. During almost seven decades of artistic life, she interpreted many forms of music but her base was always samba, which she performed with great personality, and which earned her nicknames such as: A Noiva do Samba-Can\u00E7\u00E3o (the Bride of Samba), Lady do Samba, A Magnifica (the Magnificent One), and the one most connected with her name, A Divina (the Divine One). Cardoso died of cancer at the age of 69."@en .

	dbo:abstract	"Mar\u00EDa Teresa Vera (Guanajay, February 6, 1895 \u2013 Havana, December 17, 1965) was a Cuban singer, guitarist and composer. She was an outstanding example of the Cuban trova movement. She started her career as a singer in 1911 in a theatre where she sang the criolla Mercedes of Manuel Corona. Her first guitar teacher was the cigar-roller Jos\u00E9 D\u00EDaz. Manuel Corona continued her musical education by explaining such things as the different methods for first and second guitar, and eventually taught her his compositions. That was without question of the greatest benefit to the young girl. She formed a duo with Rafael Zequeira from 1916\u20131924, when he fell ill and died. They had made over a hundred recordings together in New York, most of which have not survived. Then she met Carlos Godinez, a composer, who taught her more about the guitar; the friendship lasted until his death in 1950. She then formed the Sexteto Occidente in 1925 with Miguel Garc\u00EDa as first voice, clav\u00E9 and Director (because he knew most about music), Ignacio Pi\u00F1eiro on double bass, Julio Torres Biart on tres, Manuel Reinoso on bongo and Francisco S\u00E1nchez on maracas. They were a group of talented musicians who would have sparkling careers. She joined Lorenzo Hierrezuelo as a duet in 1935, and this duet lasted for 27 years. For much of this time Hierrezuelo ran his duo with Vera alongside his partnership with Compay Segundo (Francisco Repilado), as the duo Los Compadres. One of her best compositions, the habanera Veinte a\u00F1os, has been performed by a number of Cuban artists; S\u00F3lo pienso en ti, a bolero\u2013son, is also well-known. In 1945 she was contracted to Circuito CMQ for the radio program Cosas de Ayer. In the 1950s, she appeared in the TV program El Casino de la Alegr\u00EDa and in the 1960s she received public tributes on her retirement in 1962."@en ;

The album was heralded by the first single and video, \"I Just Can't Stand To Be Unhappy,\" which was written by noted songwriter Hugh Prestwood and entered the country charts on October 14, 1995. It peaked at No. 63 on the Hot Country Singles & Tracks. The second single and video, \"You'd Think He'd Know Me Better,\" entered the charts on March 2, 1996 and peaked at No. 56.

He is a member of the Korean pop group JYJ, and was one of the original members of boy band TVXQ. Kim made his debut in 2003 as a member of TVXQ, a boy band produced and formed by South Korean record label and talent agency S.M. Entertainment, having previously been a trainee for six years. He had released four Korean albums, four Japanese albums, thirty Japanese singles and several Korean singles during his first six years in the music industry as TVXQ. In 2009, Kim and fellow TVXQ members Kim Jaejoong and Park Yoochun filed a lawsuit against SM Entertainment, arguing that their exclusive contracts were unilaterally disadvantageous towards the artists and should be invalidated. The Seoul Central District Court ruled in favor of the three and granted an injunction suspending their contracts. The trio reunited and subsequently formed JYJ (formerly known as JUNSU/JAEJOONG/YOOCHUN in Japan). As JYJ, Kim has released one English album, two Korean albums, one Japanese EP, and one Korean EP. Kim began his solo career in 2010 with the release of Japanese EP Xiah, which peaked at number-two on Japan's Oricon singles chart. The same year, he took the role of Wolfgang in his debut musical Mozart!, receiving critical acclaim and commercial success. After the release of Xiah, Kim's solo music career was sent into hiatus because of a discord between him and his Japanese label Avex Trax that led to the sudden suspension of all his activities in Japan. In May 2012, he released his first full-length Korean solo studio album Tarantallegra, while being represented by new management agency C-JeS Entertainment. Following the release, he embarked on his first headlining world tour. He returned with his second Korean solo studio album, Incredible, in July 2013. Despite limitations in media coverage and promotional activities caused by a ban in the Entertainment Departments of South Korea's three main terrestrial broadcasters resulting from SM Entertainment's interference, Kim's first and second studio album reached top two on the Gaon albums chart in South Korea, as well as reaching number-ten and number-five on the Billboard World Albums chart for Tarantallegra and Incredible, respectively. He is also known for being able to sell out tickets for his concerts and musicals within minutes, dubbed \"the ticket power\" by South Korean media."@en ;

He was also the distinguished leader of cantors in the Great Cathedral, and was appointed to be the first instructor of hymns in the Coptic Orthodox Clerical College by Archdeacon Habib Girgis. When the Institute of Coptic Studies was established, Cantor Mikhail was appointed to be its first teacher of hymns. The hymns from Cantor Mikhail were the source of the vocal notes recorded by Professor Ernest Newlandsmith, a musicologist from Oxford University, with the help of Dr. Ragheb Moftah. In addition, Cantor Mikhail conducted the first audio recording of Coptic music. In light of this great achievement, Dr. Ragheb Moftah commented, \"He was the only way of passing down Coptic hymns in its original form to us.\" And for all of these reasons, and many others, Cantor Mikhail el-Batanouni is considered to be the master of Coptic hymnology throughout Egypt. Hence, he is frequently referred to as \"Cantor Mikhail the Great\". At the end of his journey, on 18 April 1957, Cantor Mikhail the Great departed, at the age of 83, after diligently serving the Coptic Orthodox Church for approximately 70 years. He left a great heritage of music, which was preserved by Dr. Ragheb Moftah in the United States Library of Congress. In addition, it was also cherished in the hearts and tongues of the cantors, who continuously chant them in their churches to this day. In an effort to express his deep sorrow for the lost of Cantor Mikhail, Dr. Ragheb Moftah said in his lamentation: \"You are like the River Nile that overflows to every corner of its valley. Your teachings have flooded the nations to its uttermost regions, and behold, they declare your name and everlasting treasure, as are the Pyramids that overlook the centuries. Your hymns, which the valley has echoed for thousands of years, you have preserved them for us, in a generation of alteration and change. Oh you of great heart! You have departed from this narrow place, and your spirit has joined in the world beyond, praising and chanting throughout the entire universe, glorifying the Holy of Holies.\" Source: Summarized from A Recent History of Coptic Hymns by Albair Gamal Mikhail, head of the Heritage of the Coptic Orthodox Church."@en .

	dbo:abstract	"Playa Fly (born Ibn Young on September 2, 1977) is an American rapper from Memphis, Tennessee. Fly was a member of the Triple 6 Mafia (now known as Three 6 Mafia, then known as Lil' Fly), but he stopped collaborating in 1995 due to monetary disputes and philosophical differences after recording one album under the group's guidance. Pursuing a solo career as Playa Fly, he released one independent album before signing a three album contract with Super Sigg Records. During that period he had many underground hits, perhaps the most famous being \"Nobody Needs Nobody\". Fly's early hit immediately gained notoriety from the song \"Triple Bitch Mafia\", which lashed out against his former group."@en ;
