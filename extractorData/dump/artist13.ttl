	dbo:abstract	"Eddie Meduza (real name Errol Leonard Norstedt) (17 June 1948 \u2013 17 January 2002) was a Swedish composer and musician working mainly in the rockabilly genre. Many of his songs were about alcohol, women, and cars, often with obscene lyrics. Sometimes they were also politically oriented, many aimed against the Swedish Government in power at the time Moderaterna/Centerpartiet/Folkpartiet and Swedish Social Democrats (Conservative respectively Labour-parties). He was also a popular performer of Raggare music.Norstedt's other identity was the far more vulgar E. Hitler. In this guise he generally recorded more sexually explicit material. He is remembered now mostly for his more explicit work, but many of his songs are very ironic and some contain clever, albeit unpolished, social commentary, and earn his music something of a cult following. Norstedt also recorded serious rockabilly songs with a distinct 1950s flavour in his own studio, called Studio Ronka (ronka or runka is Swedish slang for masturbation, similar to wanking in English.). He played most of the instruments himself. He often got bad reviews from the press, notably Expressen journalist Mats Olsson, to which Norstedt replied by writing even more offensive songs, such as Kuken st\u00E5r p\u00E5 Mats Olsson (Mats Olsson has a hard-on), Mats Olsson \u00E4r en j\u00E4vla b\u00F6g (Mats Olsson is a damn fag) and Mats Olsson runkar kuken (Mats Olsson is wanking his cock). He reportedly said that no matter what he did it was never good enough for the critics. Despite this he was considered an accomplished musician and songwriter, in particular by Swedish record company executive Bert Karlsson who, with mixed results, tried to foster that talent in Norstedt. He never had a major breakthrough and this is commonly attributed to his increasingly obscene songwriting. According to Meduza, he developed alcoholism in the late 1970s during periods of intensive touring. In 1981, he was convicted of drink-driving, and spent one month in prison. This jail sentence did nothing to reduce his alcohol consumption, and a year after his release, he suffered a nervous breakdown. Still, Meduza's alcoholism worsened, and a major health scare came for him in 1993, when he collapsed on his way to perform at a concert. He was diagnosed with ventricular hypertrophy (enlarged heart), and doctors warned him he would die if he drank again. Meduza initially heeded his doctors' advice, changed his lifestyle completely, sobered up and started working out. However, after only a few years, Meduza's depression worsened, and he relapsed back into alcoholism, which took its toll on his weak health. On 17 January 2002, Meduza died of a heart attack at his home in Sm\u00E5land in southern Sweden. Meduza was cremated and his ashes were scattered in the Sm\u00E5land \u00C5snen. He is survived by his wife and children."@en .

Fraser's distinctive singing has earned her much critical praise; she was once described as \"the voice of God.\" Her lyrics range from straightforward English to semi-comprehensible sentences (glossolalia) and abstract mouth music.

For the last 20 years of his life, Jones was frequently referred to as the greatest living country singer. Country music scholar Bill C. Malone writes, \"For the two or three minutes consumed by a song, Jones immerses himself so completely in its lyrics, and in the mood it conveys, that the listener can scarcely avoid becoming similarly involved.\" Waylon Jennings expressed a similar opinion in his song \"It's Alright\": \"If we all could sound like we wanted to, we'd all sound like George Jones.\" The shape of his nose and facial features earned Jones the nickname \"The Possum.\" Born in Texas, Jones first heard country music when he was seven and was given a guitar at the age of nine. He married his first wife, Dorothy Bonvillion, in 1950, and was divorced in 1951. He served in the United States Marine Corps until his discharge in 1953. He married Shirley Ann Corley in 1954. In 1959, Jones released a cover version of \"White Lightning\" by J. P. Richardson, which launched his career as a singer. His second marriage ended in divorce in 1968; he married fellow country music singer Tammy Wynette a year later. Many years of alcoholism caused his health to deteriorate severely and led to his missing many performances, earning him the nickname \"No Show Jones.\" After his divorce from Wynette in 1975, Jones married his fourth wife, Nancy Sepulvado, in 1983 and became mostly sober. Jones died in 2013, aged 81, from hypoxic respiratory failure. During his career, Jones had more than 150 hits, both as a solo artist and in duets with other artists."@en ;

He is known for his neotraditionalist country style, cowboy look, and being one of the first and main country artists to bring country music back to its roots and away from the pop country era in the 1980s. Strait's success began when his first single \"Unwound\" was a hit in 1981. During the 1980s, seven of his albums reached number one on the country charts. In the 2000s, Strait was named Artist of the Decade by the Academy of Country Music, was elected into the Country Music Hall of Fame, and won his first Grammy award for the album Troubadour. Strait was named CMA Entertainer of the Year in 1989, 1990 and 2013, and ACM Entertainer of the Year in 1990 and 2014. He has been nominated for more CMA and ACM awards and has more wins in both categories than any other artist. In 2009, he broke Conway Twitty's previous record for the most number-one hits on Billboard's Hot Country Songs chart when his 45 number one singles surpassed Twitty's 40. Counting all music charts, Strait has amassed a total of 61 number-one hits, breaking a record also previously set by Twitty, and giving him more number one songs than any other artist in any genre of music. Strait is also known for his touring career when he designed a 360- degree configuration and introduced festival style tours. For example, the Strait Tours earned $90 million in three years. His concert at AT&T Stadium in Arlington, TX in June 2014 drew 104,793 people, marking a new record for largest indoor concert in North America. Strait was successful innovating country music and in numerous aspects of being a part of popular music. Strait has sold more than 100 million records worldwide, making him one of the best-selling music artists of all time. His certifications from the RIAA include 13 multi-platinum, 33 platinum, and 38 gold albums. His best-selling album is Pure Country (1992), which sold 6 million (6\u00D7 platinum). His highest certified album is Strait Out of the Box (1995), which sold 2 million copies (8\u00D7 Platinum due to being a box set with four CDs).

His collaborative efforts with musician Brian Jackson featured a musical fusion of jazz, blues, and soul, as well as lyrical content concerning social and political issues of the time, delivered in both rapping and melismatic vocal styles by Scott-Heron. His own term for himself was \"bluesologist\", which he defined as \"a scientist who is concerned with the origin of the blues\". His music, most notably on Pieces of a Man and Winter in America in the early 1970s, influenced and helped engender later African-American music genres such as hip hop and neo soul. Scott-Heron remained active until his death, and in 2010 released his first new album in 16 years, entitled I'm New Here. A memoir he had been working on for years up to the time of his death, The Last Holiday, was published posthumously in January 2012. His recording work received much critical acclaim, especially one of his best-known compositions \"The Revolution Will Not Be Televised\". Gil Scott-Heron received a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 2012. He also is included in the exhibits at the National Museum of African American History and Culture that officially opened on Sept. 24, 2016 on the National Mall, and in an NMAAHC publication, Dream a World Anew. During the museum's opening ceremonies, the Sylvan Theater on the monument grounds was temporarily named the Gil Scott-Heron stage."@en ;

Moroder is frequently credited with pioneering Italo disco and electronic dance music. When in Munich in the 1970s, he started his own record label called Oasis Records, which several years later became a subdivision of Casablanca Records. He produced singles for Donna Summer during the late-1970s disco era, including \"Bad Girls\", \"Last Dance\", \"Love to Love You Baby\", \"No More Tears (Enough Is Enough)\", \"Dim All the Lights\", \"MacArthur Park\", \"Hot Stuff\", \"On the Radio\", and \"I Feel Love\", and is the founder of the former Musicland Studios in Munich, a recording studio used by many artists including Electric Light Orchestra, Led Zeppelin, Queen and Elton John. Moroder also composed the soundtrack for the film Midnight Express, which won an Academy Award and contained the international hit \"Chase\". Moroder also produced a number of electronic disco songs for the Three Degrees, two albums for Sparks, and a handful of songs on Bonnie Tyler's album Bitterblue as well as her 1985 single \"Here She Comes\". In 1990 he composed \"Un'estate italiana\", the official theme song of the 1990 FIFA World Cup. He also created a score of songs for performers including David Bowie, Kylie Minogue, Irene Cara, Janet Jackson, Madleen Kane, Melissa Manchester, Blondie, Japan and France Joli. Moroder has stated that the work of which he is most proud is Berlin's \"Take My Breath Away\". This song and \"Flashdance... What a Feeling\" earned him the Academy Award for Best Original Song in 1986 and 1983."@en ;

She is known for her contributions to Persian pop music, but also starred in a variety of movies from the 1950s to the 1970s. She achieved the pinnacle of her fame and success towards the end of the 1970s. Her overall impact and contributions to Persian pop earned her the title of the most iconic female pop-singer from those regions.She has recorded songs in Persian, Tajiki, Azerbaijani, Turkish, Arabic, English, French, Italian and Spanish. Following the Iranian Revolution in 1979, she is famously known for remaining in Tehran until 2000 and not performing again due to the ban on female singers. Still, her following grew. Younger people have rediscovered her music via bootleg recordings. Outside of Iran and Azerbaijan, she has a significant following in many other Middle Eastern as well as Central Asian countries, and has even caught the attention of African media and press. Recent projects include a new collaboration with singer/songwriter Hassan Shamaizadeh for the track Hayahoo from her 2012 album Ejaz, as well as serving as head judge and head of academy for the popular reality show Googoosh Music Academy which is broadcast on London based satellite channel Manoto 1."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Gregory LeNoir \"Gregg\" Allman (born December 8, 1947) is an American musician, singer and songwriter. He is best known for performing in the Allman Brothers Band. He was born and spent much of his childhood in Nashville, Tennessee, before relocating to Daytona Beach, Florida. He and his brother, Duane Allman, developed an interest in music in their teens, and began performing in the Allman Joys in the mid-1960s. In 1967, they relocated to Los Angeles and were renamed the Hour Glass, releasing two albums for Liberty Records. In 1969, he and Duane regrouped to form the Allman Brothers Band, which settled in Macon, Georgia. The Allman Brothers Band began to reach mainstream success by the early 1970s, with their live album At Fillmore East representing a commercial and artistic breakthrough. Shortly thereafter, Duane was killed in a motorcycle crash in 1971. The following year, the band's bassist, Berry Oakley was also killed in a motorcycle accident very close to the location of Duane's wreck. Their 1973 album Brothers and Sisters became their biggest hit, and Allman pursued a solo career afterward, releasing his debut album, Laid Back the same year. Internal turmoil took over the group, leading to a 1975 breakup. Allman was married to pop star Cher for the rest of the decade, while he continued his solo career with the Gregg Allman Band. After a brief Allman Brothers reunion and a decade of little activity, he reached an unexpected peak with the hit single \"I'm No Angel\" in 1987. After two more solo albums, the Allman Brothers reformed for a third and final time in 1989, and continued performing until 2014. He released his most recent solo album, Low Country Blues, in 2011, and his next, Southern Blood, is set to be released in 2017. For his work in music, Allman has received numerous awards including several Grammys; he has been inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and the Georgia Music Hall of Fame. His distinctive voice placed him in 70th place in the Rolling Stone list of the \"100 Greatest Singers of All Time\". Allman released an autobiography, My Cross to Bear, in 2012."@en ;

His musical style is often considered a blend of Southern rock, blues, and traditional country. He is the son of legendary country music singer Hank Williams and the father of Hank Williams III, Holly Williams, Hilary Williams, Samuel Williams, and Katie Williams. Williams began his career by following in his famed father's footsteps, singing his father's songs and imitating his father's style. Williams's own style slowly evolved as he struggled to find his own voice and place within the country music industry. This trend was interrupted by a near-fatal fall off the side of Ajax Peak in Montana on August 8, 1975. After an extended recovery, he challenged the country music establishment with a blend of country, rock, and blues. Williams enjoyed much success in the 1980s, from which he earned considerable recognition and popularity both inside and outside the country music industry. As a multi-instrumentalist, Williams's repertoire of skills include guitar, bass guitar, upright bass, steel guitar, banjo, dobro, piano, keyboards, harmonica, fiddle, and drums. From 1989 until October 2011, a version of his song \"All My Rowdy Friends Are Coming Over Tonight\" was used as the opening for broadcasts of Monday Night Football."@en ;

Lavoe was born and raised in the Machuelo Abajo barrio of Ponce, Puerto Rico. Early in his life, he attended the Ponce Free School of Music known today as the Instituto de M\u00FAsica Juan Morel Campos, and, inspired by Jes\u00FAs S\u00E1nchez Erazo, developed an interest in music. He moved to New York City on 3 May 1963, at the age of sixteen. Shortly after his arrival, he worked as the singer in a sextet formed by Roberto Garc\u00EDa. During this period, he performed with several other groups, including Orquesta New York, Kako All-Stars, and the Johnny Pacheco band. In 1967, Lavoe joined Willie Col\u00F3n's band as its vocalist, recording several hit songs, including \"El Malo\" and \"Canto a Borinquen\". Lavoe moved on to become a soloist and formed his own band performing as lead vocalist. As a soloist, Lavoe recorded several hits including: \"El cantante\" composed by Rub\u00E9n Blades, \"Bandolera\" composed by Col\u00F3n, and \"Peri\u00F3dico de ayer\" composed by Tite Curet Alonso. During this period he was frequently featured as a guest singer with the Fania All Stars recording numerous tracks with the band. In 1979, Lavoe became deeply depressed and sought the help of a high priest of the Santer\u00EDa faith to treat to his drug addiction. After a short rehabilitation, he relapsed following the deaths of his father, son, and mother in law. These events, along with being diagnosed with HIV, drove Lavoe to attempt suicide by jumping off a hotel room balcony. He survived the attempt and recorded an album before his health began failing. Lavoe died on June 29, 1993, from a complication of AIDS."@en ;

MacKaye is currently a member of The Evens, a two-piece Indie rock group he formed with his wife Amy Farina in 2001. Along with his seminal band Minor Threat, he is credited with coining the term \"straight edge\" to describe a personal ideology that promotes independence by countering the popular appeal of drug and alcohol abuse, though MacKaye has stated many times that he did not intend to turn it into a movement. A key figure in the development of hardcore punk and an independent-minded, do it yourself punk ethic, MacKaye also works as a producer, and has produced releases by Q and Not U, John Frusciante, 7 Seconds, Nation of Ulysses, Bikini Kill, Rites of Spring, Dag Nasty, and Rollins Band among others."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Isaac Lee Hayes, Jr. (August 20, 1942 \u2013 August 10, 2008) was an American soul singer, songwriter, actor, producer, and voice artist. Hayes was one of the creative forces behind the southern soul music label Stax Records, where he served both as an in-house songwriter and as a session musician and record producer, teaming with his partner David Porter during the mid-1960s. Hayes and Porter, along with Bill Withers, the Sherman Brothers, Steve Cropper, and John Fogerty were inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 2005 in recognition of writing scores of notable songs for themselves, the duo Sam & Dave, Carla Thomas, and others. Hayes is also a 2002 inductee into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. The hit song \"Soul Man\", written by Hayes and Porter and first performed by Sam & Dave, has been recognized as one of the most influential songs of the past 50 years by the Grammy Hall of Fame. It was also honored by The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, by Rolling Stone magazine, and by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) as one of the Songs of the Century. During the late 1960s, Hayes also began a career as a recording artist. He had several successful soul albums such as Hot Buttered Soul (1969) and Black Moses (1971). In addition to his work in popular music, he worked as a composer of musical scores for motion pictures. He was well known for his musical score for the film Shaft (1971). For the \"Theme from Shaft\", he was awarded the Academy Award for Best Original Song in 1972. He became the third African-American, after Sidney Poitier and Hattie McDaniel, to win an Academy Award in any competitive field covered by Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. He also won two Grammy Awards for that same year. Later, he was given his third Grammy for his music album Black Moses. In recognition of his humanitarian work there Hayes was crowned honorary king of the Ada, Ghana region in 1992. He acted in motion pictures and television, such as in the movies Truck Turner and I'm Gonna Git You Sucka, and as Gandolf \"Gandy\" Fitch in the TV series The Rockford Files (1974\u20131980). He voiced character Chef on the animated Comedy Central series South Park from its debut in 1997 until 2005. His influences were Percy Mayfield, Big Joe Turner, James Brown, Jerry Butler, Sam Cooke, Fats Domino, Marvin Gaye, Otis Redding, and psychedelic soul groups like The Chambers Brothers and Sly and the Family Stone. On August 5, 2003, Hayes was honored as a BMI Icon at the 2003 BMI Urban Awards for his enduring influence on generations of music makers. Throughout his songwriting career, Hayes received five BMI R&B Awards, two BMI Pop Awards, two BMI Urban Awards and six Million-Air citations. As of 2008, his songs generated more than 12 million performances."@en ;

Although recognized first and foremost as a vocalist, bassist and songwriter, he also played double bass, harmonica, piano, cello and guitar. He was trained as a classical cellist and considered himself a jazz musician, although much of his catalogue of compositions and recordings tended toward rock and blues."@en ;

He is known as the lead singer and guitarist of duo The White Stripes, and has had success in other bands and as a solo artist. On April 24, 2012, White released his debut solo album, Blunderbuss. His second studio album, Lazaretto, was released on June 10, 2014. Both received wide commercial and critical acclaim. After moonlighting in several underground Detroit bands as a drummer, White founded The White Stripes with fellow Detroit native Meg White in 1997. Their 2001 breakthrough album, White Blood Cells, brought them international fame with the hit single and accompanying music video, \"Fell in Love with a Girl\". This recognition provided White opportunities to collaborate with famous artists, including Loretta Lynn and Bob Dylan. In 2006, White founded The Raconteurs with Brendan Benson, and in 2009 founded The Dead Weather with Alison Mosshart of The Kills. White has enjoyed consistent critical and popular success, and is widely credited as one of the key artists in the garage rock revival of the 2000s. He has won eight Grammy Awards, and both of his solo albums have reached number one on the Billboard charts. Rolling Stone ranked him number 70 on its 2010 list of \"The 100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time\". David Fricke's 2011 list ranked him at number 17. White has an extensive collection of guitars and other instruments, and has a preference for vintage items that often have connections to famous blues artists. He is a vocal advocate for analog technology and recording techniques, and he is a board member of the Library of Congress' National Recording Preservation Foundation. His record label and studio Third Man Records releases vinyl recordings of his own work, as well as that of other artists and local school children. His latest album holds the record for most first-week vinyl sales since 1991. White values his privacy and has been known to create misdirection about his personal life; he has been called \"eccentric.\" He and Meg divorced in 2000. He married the model and singer Karen Elson in 2005. They divorced in 2013. Together, they have a son and daughter. He currently resides in Nashville, Tennessee."@en ;

He is best known for his work with Weather Report from 1976 to 1981, as well as work with artists including Joni Mitchell, Pat Metheny, and his own solo projects. As a musician, he developed an influential approach to bass playing that combined the use of complex harmony with virtuosic technique. His signature approach employed Latin-influenced funk, lyrical solos on fretless bass, bass chords, and innovative use of harmonics. He was inducted into the Down Beat Jazz Hall of Fame in 1988, one of only seven bassists so honored (and the only electric bassist)."@en ;

A key figure in No Wave, Chance has been playing a combination of improvisational jazz-like music and punk in the New York music scene since the late 1970s, in such bands as Teenage Jesus and the Jerks, James Chance and the Contortions, James White and the Blacks (as he appeared in the film Downtown 81), The Flaming Demonics, James Chance & the Sardonic Symphonics, James Chance and Terminal City, and James Chance and Les Contortions. Chance differed from some of his no wave compatriots by possessing (and demanding from his band) a certain level of musical skill and talent. His music can be described as combining the freeform playing of Ornette Coleman with the solid funk rhythm of James Brown, though filtered through a punk rock lens."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Jeremy Taylor (born 24 November 1937 in Newbury, Berkshire) is a retired English folk singer and songwriter who has spent much of his life in South Africa, originally as a teacher of English at St. Martin's School (Rosettenville) in southern Johannesburg, but since 1994 has lived in Wales and in France. Part stand-up comedian, part singer, Taylor has used his talents to confront the idiosyncrasies as well as societal woes in life. Much of Taylor's unique songwriting and the success he has enjoyed with many of his songs originate with his live performances. His various accents, facial expressions, mannerisms, and dramatic pauses at critical points in his songs, with a particular chosen word or two, often are arguably what makes his humorous songs so popular. Taylor has the distinction of having performed songs that not only question social problems in society, but was a pioneer in the area of finding ways to do so while allowing the audience to laugh at themselves, especially in an era where, in the late 1950s and early 1960s McCarthyism menaced free thinkers in the United States, while at home in South Africa, both Taylor, and his songs, often political, were banned in South Africa by the South African Broadcasting Corporation and the Government, during the apartheid era."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Joseph Fidler \"Joe\" Walsh (born November 20, 1947) is an American singer-songwriter, composer, multi-instrumentalist and record producer. In a career spanning more than 40 years, Walsh has been a member of five successful rock bands: James Gang, Barnstorm, the Eagles, The Party Boys, and Ringo Starr & His All-Starr Band. In the 1990s, he was also a member of the short-lived supergroup The Best. He has also experienced success both as a solo artist and prolific session musician, being featured on a wide array of other artists' recordings. In 2011, Rolling Stone placed Walsh at the number 54 spot on its list of \"100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time.\" In the mid-1960s, after attending Kent State University, Walsh played with several local Ohio-based bands before reaching a national audience as a member of the James Gang, whose hit song \"Funk #49\" highlighted Walsh's skill as both a guitarist and vocalist. After the James Gang broke up in 1972, Walsh formed a band, Barnstorm, with Joe Vitale, a college friend of Walsh's from Ohio, and Kenny Passarelli, a bassist from Colorado, where Walsh had settled as his home after leaving Ohio. While the band would stay together for three albums over three years, their works were marketed as Walsh solo projects. The last Barnstorm album, 1974's So What contained significant guest contributions from several members of the Eagles, a group that had recently hired Walsh's producer, Bill Szymczyk. At Szymczyk's suggestion, Walsh joined the Eagles in 1975 as the group's keyboardist and guitarist following the departure of their founding member Bernie Leadon, with Hotel California being his first album with the band. In 1998 a reader's poll conducted by Guitarist magazine selected the guitar solos on the track \"Hotel California\" by Walsh and Don Felder as the best guitar solos of all time. Guitar World magazine listed it at eighth of the Top 100 Guitar Solos. Besides his work with his several bands, he has released twelve solo studio albums, six compilation albums and two live albums. His solo hits include \"Rocky Mountain Way\", \"Life's Been Good\", \"All Night Long\", \"A Life of Illusion\" and \"Ordinary Average Guy\". As a member of the Eagles, Walsh was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1998, and into the Vocal Group Hall of Fame in 2001. The Eagles are considered to be one of the most influential bands of the 1970s, and they remain the best-selling American band in the history of popular music. Walsh's creative contribution to music has received praise from many of the best rock guitarists, including Led Zeppelin's Jimmy Page, who praised Walsh by saying \"He has a tremendous feel for the instrument. I've loved his style since the early James Gang.\" Eric Clapton said that \"He's one of the best guitarists to surface in some time. I don't listen to many records, but I listen to his.\" The Who's guitarist Pete Townshend, a friend of Walsh's, commented that \"Joe Walsh is a fluid and intelligent player. There're not many like that around.\""@en ;

First coming to prominence with saxophonist Cannonball Adderley, Zawinul went on to play with trumpeter Miles Davis, and to become one of the creators of jazz fusion, an innovative musical genre that combined jazz with elements of rock and world music. Later, Zawinul co-founded the groups Weather Report and world fusion music-oriented The Zawinul Syndicate. Additionally, he made pioneering use of electric piano and synthesizers. Zawinul was named \"Best Electric Keyboardist\" 28 times by the readers of Down Beat magazine. A number of prominent musical artists have honored Zawinul with compositions, including Brian Eno's instrumental \"Zawinul/Lava\", John McLaughlin's instrumental \"Jozy\", Warren Cuccurullo's \"Hey Zawinul\", Bob Baldwin's \"Joe Zawinul\", Chucho Vald\u00E9s's \"Zawinul's Mambo\", Bir\u00E9li Lagr\u00E8ne's instrumental \"Josef\" and Toninho Horta's instrumental \"Balada para Zawinul\". Zawinul's playing style was often dominated by quirky melodic improvisations \u2013 traversing bebop, ethnic and pop styles \u2013 combined with sparse but rhythmic playing of big-band sounding chords or bass lines. In Weather Report, he often employed a vocoder as well as pre-recorded sounds played (i.e. filtered and transposed) through a synthesizer, a method or technique called sampling, creating a very distinctive synthesis of jazz harmonies and \"noise\" (\"using all the sounds the world generates\")."@en ;

His memoir, Hit Hard: A Story of Hitting Rock Bottom at the Top, was released on June 30, 2009. Kramer married his girlfriend Linda in 2009. They currently reside in Georgetown, near Austin, Texas. Kramer is credited with originating the name Aerosmith. In his memoir, Kramer revealed that he idly conceived the name Aerosmith while listening to Harry Nilsson's album Aerial Ballet in 1968, two years before the band was formed. Kramer insists that there is no connection between the name \"Aerosmith\" and Sinclair Lewis' novel Arrowsmith.Shortly before joining Aerosmith Kramer worked with Chubby & The Turnpikes (later to be known as Tavares) alongside Bernie Worrell.He made a guest appearance in the 22nd season of The Simpsons, in the episode \"The Ned-Liest Catch\", as a former partner of Bart's teacher Mrs. Krabappel, as told in the third season episode Flaming Moe's, which featured the whole of Aerosmith, the first ever band to guest star on the show.In 2015, Kramer tweeted about how he had been made into a Simpsons action figure. In June 2011, Kramer did a fan Q&A and revealed his open-mindedness to outside writers, stating he does not care about it as long as it's all five members of Aerosmith playing the material written. In 2013 Kramer announced his new partnership with Comfort Foods, Inc. who now will roast, package and distribute his whole bean, organic coffee line: Rockin\u2019 & Roastin\u2019 Coffee. In 2015, he announced a business partnership with Les Otten, the former vice chairman of the Boston Red Sox, to open two Joey Kramer's Rockin\u2019 & Roastin\u2019 Caf\u00E9 and Restaurant.

He is best known as the drummer of the rock band The Doors, and as such is a member of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. He was the sole drummer in the Doors' history and appeared on every recording made by the band. Densmore is also noted for his veto of attempts by the other two Doors members, in the wake of singer Jim Morrison's 1971 death, to accept offers to license the rights to various Doors songs for commercial purposes, as well as his objections to their ongoing use in the 21st century of the Doors name and logo, and his lengthy and successful court battles to gain compliance. Densmore has worked additionally in the performing arts as a dancer and actor, and written successfully as both a playwright and the author of two books on the topic of the Doors."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"John Peter Farnham, Jr. AO (born 1 July 1949), formerly billed as Johnny Farnham from his professional debut in 1967 until 1980, is an English-born Australian pop singer. Farnham was a teen pop idol from 1964 to 1979, but has since forged a career as an adult contemporary singer. His career has mostly been as a solo artist although he replaced Glenn Shorrock as lead singer of Little River Band from 1982 to 1985. In September 1986 his solo single, \"You're the Voice\" peaked at No. 1 on the Australian singles charts. The associated album, Whispering Jack, held the No. 1 position for a total of 25 weeks and is the highest-selling album in Australian history. Both the single and the album had Top Ten success internationally including No. 1 in Sweden, hero. Domestically he has remained one of Australia's best-known performers with a career spanning over 45 years, and he is the only Australian artist to have a number one record in five consecutive decades (echoing that of Cliff Richard in the UK) with singles: \"Sadie (The Cleaning Lady)\" in 1967, \"Raindrops Keep Fallin' on My Head\" in 1969/1970, and \"Age of Reason\" in 1988; and albums: Age of Reason, Chain Reaction in 1990, Then Again... in 1993, Anthology 1: Greatest Hits 1986\u20131997 in 1997, 33\u2153 in 2000, The Last Time in 2002  and Two Strong Hearts Live in 2015, hero. Farnham has been recognised by honours and awards including 1987 Australian of the Year, 1996 Officer of the Order of Australia, and 19 ARIA Awards including his 2003 induction into the Hall of Fame. From 1969 he was voted by TV Week readers as the 'King of Pop' for five consecutive years. Aside from his recording career, Farnham performed on stage with lead roles in Australian productions of Charlie Girl, Pippin and 1992's Jesus Christ Superstar. He starred in his own TV series and specials including It's Magic (With Colleen Hewett) and Bobby Dazzler and as a guest on numerous other popular shows such as Countdown and Hey Hey It's Saturday. Australian rock historian, Ian McFarlane described him as \"the most successful solo artist in the history of Australian rock and pop ... Farnham has retained an affable sense of humour and a simple, unpretentious 'everyman' charm which also makes him one of the most respected celebrities and dead set legends in Australian entertainment history.\""@en ;
