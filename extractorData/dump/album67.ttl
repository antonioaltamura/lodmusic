Wainwright claimed that Out of the Game contained the \"poppiest\", most \"danceable\" music in his repertoire to date and was influenced by the birth of his daughter and the death of his mother, Kate McGarrigle. Musical influences included David Bowie, Elton John and Queen. Wainwright began touring to promote the album in April 2012. \"Out of the Game\" was the album's first single, released in March via iTunes and April via Decca/Polydor."@en ;

Music Radar summed up the tunes as \"fresh, vital roadhouse blues.\" Another track, \"Flyin' High\", appropriately made its world premiere in space, when the then-unfinished song was played on board a Soyuz spacecraft during its launch to the International Space Station in June 2011 at the request of the NASA astronaut Mike Fossum, a long-time ZZ Top fan and friend.

It was the Stones' first public concert in over two years, and was planned as an introduction of new guitarist, Mick Taylor, though circumstances inevitably changed following the death of former member Brian Jones two days earlier. The band rehearsed at the Beatles' studio in the basement of 3 Savile Row, and Jagger and Richards came up with a 14-song set; the Hyde Park concert would be the first time many of the songs had been played before a public audience. The PA system was supplied by Watkins Electric Music, who had already handled amplification at previous Hyde Park shows. Fans started to arrive at the park with candles on 4 July in tribute to Jones, and by the morning of 5 July, 7,000 people had already gathered. Mick Jagger read a short eulogy on stage before the Stones' set began, reading two stanzas of Percy Bysshe Shelley's poem on John Keats's death, Adona\u00EFs, from a calf-bound book. After this recital, several hundred cabbage white butterflies were released. The setlist for their performance was \"I'm Yours & I'm Hers,\" \"Jumpin' Jack Flash,\" \"Mercy Mercy\", \"Down Home Girl\", \"Stray Cat Blues\", \"No Expectations\", \"I'm Free\", \"Loving Cup\", \"Love in Vain\", \"(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction\", \"Honky Tonk Women\", \"Midnight Rambler\", \"Street Fighting Man\", and \"Sympathy for the Devil\". During the 18-minute-long rendition of \"Sympathy for the Devil\", a number of African tribal drummers joined the band. While the event is considered a memorable one by several critics, they also agree that it was not one of the Stones' best performances, and the guitars played during the concert were out of tune. In a 1971 interview with Rolling Stone magazine, Keith Richards evaluated their performance, \"We played pretty bad until near the end, because we hadn't played for years ... Nobody minded, because they just wanted to hear us play again.\" The Stones' portion of concert was filmed by Granada Television and broadcast that September. It has since been released on DVD and Blu-ray. In April 2013, the band announced their intention to play two return concerts on 6 and 13 July, although the performances were not free."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Dark Days/Light Years, the ninth studio album by Super Furry Animals, was digitally released at 8pm on 16 March 2009 via the band's website, with a physical release following on the 21st of April on Rough Trade Records. The album's title is taken from a lyric in the song \"Moped Eyes\" (\"dark days seem light years away\"). Many of the songs on the album are based on riffs and grooves the band had been working on for several years. The band originally planned to record the album in Miraval, France like their previous effort Hey Venus!, but decided to record in Cardiff with a considerably lower budget than previous efforts. The completion of the album was documented by a series of 22 short films that were shown on the Super Furry Animals website, with one film added each day leading up to its original digital release. The videos were inspired by the Mike Figgis film Timecode and were described by The Guardian as \"at once enormously dull, pleasingly insightful and curiously compelling.\" Longtime sleeve designer Pete Fowler collaborated with Hey Venus! artist Keiichi Tanaami to produce the album's artwork. According to Rhys Tanaami wanted to work with the band having seen Fowler's previous Super Furry Animals record sleeves.The track \"Inaugural Trams\" includes spoken word German vocals by Franz Ferdinand's Nick McCarthy. The band broadcast a live show on their own website (superfurry.com) featuring songs from the album on the day of its digital release, which proved a success despite initial technical glitches. They didn't tour the album in a conventional manner, gigging infrequently. The 12\" vinyl release features different artwork from the CD version, and also has a free copy of the album on CD slipped inside the sleeve. The album peaked at #23 in the UK Album Charts in its first week of physical release. It may have charted higher but the band sold a number of pre-order copies and digital downloads via their website, which is not a registered chart company. At just over an hour, it is the band's longest album. To promote the album, lead singer Gruff Rhys described it as having a \"biblical sound,\" and said that the band wouldn't be able to play any of its songs indoors."@en ;

dbr:Put_You_in_the_Picture	rdf:type	schema:MusicAlbum ;
	dbo:abstract	"\"Put You in the Picture\" is a song written by Midge Ure, and performed by his group PVC2, who comprised Ure on guitar and lead vocals, Kenny Hyslop on drums, Billy McIsaac on keyboards and Russell Webb on bass guitar. The song was released on August 30, 1977 by Zoom Records, in an eponymous EP, which was the last single and recording of Midge Ure with the remaining members of Slik, who later resurged as Zones, with another singer and guitarist, Willie Gardner. In August 2006, Ryan Foley listed the single as #8 in his Top 10 list of Scottish punk singles in Stylus Magazine. Foley declared that \"\u201CPain\u201D is thundering and thrashy, and heavily inspired by contemporary acts such as The Clash. Ure\u2019s vocals on the chorus feature all the gusto of a medieval torturer, and are a far cry from the saccharine tunes he was doing just 18 months earlier (in reference to Ure's vocal style in Slik).\". PVC2 was a Scottish punk band who resurged from the ashes of one-time promising teenybop band Slik, whose songs a very different repertoire, with the typically 1970's soft and glam rock and like-Bay City Rollers songs. From early to almost-late 1976, the band was very popular in Britain, but the emergence of punk stopped all the prominence of the bands who established some time ago. The Slik album was unsuccessful, like the last singles, released until 1977. That year, then bassist Jim McGinlay departed, and got replaced by Russell Webb, who recently dropped university in Glasgow. The band continued performing like Slik, but changed abruptly of style, naming themselves as PVC2 and beginning to play punk rock. During the last days of Slik or the first of PVC2, Ure joined for brief time Rich Kids, band founded by original Sex Pistols bassist, Glen Matlock, but wasn't so interested and departed shortly afterwards to dedicate time to PVC2. After the release of the EP, Ure quit and moved to London to rejoin Rich Kids, re-recording the \"Put You in the Picture\" song in the album Ghosts of Princes in Towers, released in August 1978. Late that year, the band stopped, and split up officially in mid-1979, when Ure was recently an Ultravox member (he joined in April of that year)."@en ;

Jeff Arwadi recorded the entire songs on this album all by himself, and started shortly after he moved to Canada in 2006. There is an official music video for the song \"Narrow Avenue\". The album was originally supposed to be released by a now-defunct record label NePlusUltra Music in CD format in December 2008, with the first pressing a special digipak release that was hand-numbered and limited to 777 copies. Unfortunately, the physical release never came about, and the album was released instead as a free digital download on 25 December 2012. In December 2012, four years after the initial release date, the album was finally being released physically, as a bonus-CD of the limited hand-numbered deluxe double-CD edition of a 2012 Kekal album Autonomy, while the free download version had been discontinued in favor of the paid download, which is now made available on the band's Bandcamp page.

As such, it represents a belated sequel to the band's original three-LP 1972 release, Europe '72. Around the time of the production of the massive Europe '72: The Complete Recordings box set in 2011, Grateful Dead archivist David Lemieux was charged with the task of developing this follow-up compilation, nearly four decades later, without repeating any of the songs that appeared on Europe '72. As with the box set, all of the music for this CD was remastered from the original 16-track tapes and encoded with HDCD specifications. The artwork for the release is by Stanley Mouse, who, along with his late partner, Alton Kelley, created the recognizable images for the original release."@en ;

As with the rest of the series, Me Against the World features mostly unsigned bands contributing songs that were previously unreleased. Reviewer Johnny Loftus of Allmusic remarks that \"Sonically, it is a little more diverse, or at least there are a few left turns among all the quiet-loud dynamics this time around.\" He calls the album \"Just as worthy as its Emo Diaries brethren yet filled with refreshing moments of instrumental or melodic experimentation, Vol. 7 is sure to please the Deep Elm faithful and is a good introductory calling card for many of its participants.\""@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Peach Fuzz is the 6th studio album from Enuff Z'Nuff. Like the band's 1994 release 1985, this album is viewed more as an archival release than a new album since it features mostly previously recorded material. For example, the tracks \"Let It Go\" and \"Kitty\" were initially b-sides to the U.K. edition of the Strength single \"Mother's Eyes,\" while the song \"Happy Holiday\" was first intended for the 1992 film Home Alone 2. Many of the remaining tracks on Peach Fuzz were recorded during the making of the 1993 album Animals With Human Intelligence, but were likely excluded from that release due to their poppier sounding nature. At the time of release, the album was largely ignored in the band's concert setlists, with the exception of \"Vacant Love.\" In more recent years, the song \"Kitty\" has also been performed. Although no singles were released from the album, \"Happy Holiday\" has turned into one of the band's more popular songs due to its inclusion in Christmas themed CD's such as Monster Ballads XMas and We Wish You A Hairy Christmas. Peach Fuzz was initially released in Japan with a slightly different track order and a bonus track. It was later re-issued in the United States in 2008 with the original Japanese track order reinstated along with different artwork. A liner note commentary for all versions was penned by Chris Nadler, an editor at Request and Creem Magazine."@en ;

Her first German language album, it marked a transition from the hip hop\u2013driven Balkan pop style from her previous records, Chefa (2007) and The Sweetest Hangover (2009), which was largely inspired by her 2012 number-one hit single \"Lila Wolken\" with rappers Marteria and Yasha. Consequently, it incorporates contemporary R&B and electropop styles with elements from other genres of music, including dance and PBR&B. Again, Platnum enlisted longtime collaborators David Conen, Vincent von Schlippenbach, and Dirk Berger from production trio The Krauz to work with her on Gluck und Benzin. Upon its release, they received generally mixed to positive reviews for their effort. The album debuted at number thirty-four on the German Albums Chart."@en ;

Records, and on Double Vinyl LP in Summer 2012. The record marked their first studio album to be released without the aid of a Grammy-nominated producer (Machine producing their first record, Alex Newport producing their second); as well as their first studio album not released on Best Before Records. The album cover, as with their other albums, features drawings by Lewes Herriot. The album was assigned a Metacritic rating of 66, indicating \"generally favourable reviews\". Some controversy arose when the NME website chose a writer who had already had disagreements with the band's lead singer Alexei to review the album. This writer gave the album a highly negative review and a score of 3.0/10. This was responded to with a backlash by fans and readers alike, who together used the NME's album rating system to give the album a score of 9.4/10. The double vinyl version of the album adds the Certain Songs are Cursed EP\u2014minus the original mix of \"What Drummers Get\"\u2014and two original songs from the (Don't) Show Us Your Fangs and You vs Everything singles."@en ;

It is their third album with original singer J\u00F8rn Lande, the first since his original departure in 2006, and the last before his final departure in 2012. He left the band in 2006 for the first time, citing musical differences as the reason. The album was originally planned to be released on April 16, 2010 but during a listening session in Hamburg it was confirmed that the release date was pushed back to May 21. The album features a rawer and less complex sound than the previous albums but still with Masterplan's progressive and melodic power metal trademarks. Lead singer J\u00F8rn Lande had a major contribution to the songwriting, he wrote some of the music and all the lyrics for the songs. Also keyboardist Axel Mackenrott took part as one of the main songwriters and brought the ideas for songs like Time To Be King and Blue Europa. Roland Grapow said Axel is now \"totally filling the shoes of Uli (Kusch) and he has a very familiar style of writing that I love so much and it\u2019s very important for the band.\" J\u00F8rn Lande has recorded a slightly different version of the title track on his 2012 solo album, Bring Heavy Rock to the Land. The band had some problems touring during the time the album was released due to some of the band members' other commitments. This resulted in the departure of bass player Jan S.

The recording, made during the first leg of the 1987 Clutching at Straws tour, documents the band at the peak of their commercial success in the 1980s when they had original frontman Fish on vocals. The show was attended by an audience of 20,000; support acts were Magnum, The Cult (cancelled), and It Bites. It comprises songs from the four studio albums they released up to that point, i.e. Script for a Jester's Tear (1983), Fugazi (1984), Misplaced Childhood (1985), and Clutching at Straws (1987). The non-album debut single \"Market Square Heroes\" is also included.

Both tracks were recorded during the Wavering Radiant sessions.

The album was released 13 July 2010 on CD format, with vinyl copies available a week earlier from Vacation Vinyl in Los Angeles. Pitchfork's Jess Harvell was unimpressed by Isis\u2032 contribution to the split, stating that \u201CIsis seem to be building to something on these songs, but the climaxes are so restrained you can almost miss them if you're not paying close enough attention [...] I kept hoping Isis would finally let loose, offer a little chaos. After all, the best part of Mogwai's \"Like Herod\" isn't the clockwork precision; it's the freak out.\u201D As for the Melvins side, she deemed it \u201Cmore of the same, but here I don't mean that in a disparaging way at all\u201D, and found that \u201Cthe grooves, especially on \"I'll Finish You Off\", have the same punchy dynamics the Isis tunes lack.\u201D Isis frontman and owner of Hydra Head Records, Aaron Turner, documented the design process of the album art on his personal blog. It was released after Isis had announced their imminent dissolution, and currently stands as their last record. However, two posthumous compilations are lined up for Isis, which would make this their third-final output. Melvins subsequently supported Isis for several dates on their farewell tour."@en ;

The album's title \"The Sinister Supremacy\", and release date of 28 June 2013, was announced on 4 April 2013. Regarding the title, the band said: \"The Sinister Supremacy\" is a metaphor for the evil that controls us. It's the dark part of our minds and it\u2019s inside us all. It tells us it's OK to do bad things, to hurt other people, and hurt ourselves. It guides us into making choices based on pure selfishness, and it thrives on complete chaos. The track listing and the album cover were both revealed on 9 May 2013.

	dbo:abstract	"Orthophonic Joy: The 1927 Bristol Sessions Revisited is a double-CD produced by Grammy Award-winner Carl Jackson, a Bluegrass and Country music artist, as a benefit for the Birthplace of Country Music Museum in Bristol, Tennessee. The project was conceived by executive producer Rusty Morrell, a Bristol native who was well acquainted with the story of the historic 1927 Bristol Sessions and imagined a modern tribute to the sessions that have been dubbed the 'big bang' of Country Music. The project includes 37 tracks - 18 songs and 19 spoken word tracks that provide context. WSM disc jockey and country music historian Eddie Stubbs narrates the project, and a who's who of country artists recorded the new versions of the old classics. Jackson recorded the album between 2013 and 2015. It was released by Sony Legacy Recordings on May 12, 2015. The purpose of the 1927 sessions was to record new talent for a public that was buying the new Orthophonic Victrola in record numbers. It launched the recording careers of Jimmie Rodgers and The Carter Family. Ernest Stoneman, already a popular recording artist, convinced Victor executive Ralph Peer to set up a temporary recording studio in Bristol. In a similar vein, the producers sponsored a talent contest for the Orthophonic Joy project. Corbin Hayslett, a 20-year-old banjo player, won the competition with his rendition of \"Darling Cora,\" which he ultimately recorded for the project."@en ;

The album was released on June 7, 2011, through Deathwish Inc.. It was recorded and produced in five days with Ed Rose at his own Black Lodge Recording studio in Eudora, Kansas. The band was recorded live to give the album a more \"honest/raw\" feel. The band said they chose to work with Rose because of the work he had done with The Casket Lottery.[citation needed] To promote Parting the Sea Between Brightness and Me, Touch\u00E9 Amor\u00E9 released one part of the album cover per week through the guitarist Nick Steinhardt's blog. The group also made \"Amends\", \"Home Away from Here\" and \"~\" available for online streaming before the official release of the album. On its release, the album received generally positive reviews from music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 81, based on 7 reviews, which indicates \"universal acclaim\"."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Seventh Heaven Club is the second album by Mark Seymour and the Undertow, which was released in March 2013. The album is a collection of covers of love songs by artists including Bob Dylan, Neil Young, Jackson Browne, Dave Dobbyn and Otis Redding. It also includes a duet with Lucinda Williams on a version of her 2007 song, \"Come On\". Seymour said the album had its genesis while he was \"courting his wife\" in New Zealand with the music of Tom Petty and Dave Dobbyn in the background. He formed the idea of a concept album of love songs, eventually dismissing a thought of including two of his own songs. He said: \"It begins with \"Lorelei\" because it's about the mythology of love and each song is moving further into the complexity of sexual intimacy. It ends with Redding\u2014he's like, give it to me\u2014all my intentions are completely single. They're the bookends. In between the other songs are tough stuff.\" He said he had been performing \"Lorelei\" for years. He explained: \"I knew I was going to record it and I heard (daughter) Hannah singing in her room one day and it was obvious she should sing it. The woman's voice in that song is a ghost. She's a mythological character. She is the voice of Lorelei inside someone's head. Hannah also has the quality of that pure Celtic tone. She's the right person for it.\" Seymour said he performed the duet with Williams \"by mail\". \"We sent the multi-track across to her. She said she wanted to do it and recorded three versions and sent them back. I love the angst in that song. It's brutal, aggressive and full of irony. It's not really a lyric built for duets, but the idea of the two voices having opposite spins on the same song appealed to me.\""@en ;

The sessions are entirely based on the music of modern rock n' roll groups, in contrast to Kenton's earlier work which primarily featured swing with some progressive jazz leanings. The album's influence on future large ensemble jazz composition and arranging has led more recent critiques to acknowledge it as the most influential album of the later Kenton orchestras and of the 1970s.

It was recorded on June 16\u201317, 1964 at the legendary CBS 30th Street Studio, except for \"Zen Is When\" which was recorded on January 30, 1960. It was released on August 10, 1964. The album, as the back cover of the remastered CD confirms, had been long out-of-print until it was reissued on CD in 2001, then re-released in 2008 and 2009. In the album booklet, Brubeck talks about the quartet's trip to Japan and provides poignant and interesting information for each piece of the album, explaining what inspired a certain piece, for instance. In fact, the album is a sort of trip diary. This is how Brubeck himself describes the project: \"The tunes in this album are personal impressions from the Quartet's tour of Japan, Spring 1964. No one in a brief visit can hope to absorb and comprehend all that is strange to him. Sights and sounds, exotic in their freshness, arouse the senses to a new awareness. The music we have prepared tries to convey these minute but lasting impressions, wherein the poet expects the reader to feel the scene himself as an experience. The poem suggests the feeling.\" \"Koto Song\" is the only piece from the album that became a Brubeck standard; he would record it numerous times in the following years."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Jolly What! England's Greatest Recording Stars: The Beatles and Frank Ifield on Stage is a 1964 compilation album, released by Vee-Jay Records and featuring tracks by English rock band The Beatles and by the Australian-English easy listening and country singer Frank Ifield. Ifield toured the UK in 1963. While Vee-Jay Records temporarily had the US rights to a number of The Beatles' recordings, they released Jolly What! on 26 February 1964. The LP consisted of four studio Beatles songs (all previously released on Vee Jay singles), plus eight recordings of Ifield. The original pressing has a drawing of a chubby old man with a moustache and a Beatle wig, and is itself quite rare. However, just before Vee Jay's publishing rights were about to expire on 10 October 1964 they changed the sleeve cover to a drawing of the Beatles. (This version, titled The Beatles & Frank Ifield on Stage also listed all four Beatles' tracks on the front cover, but none of the eight contributed by Ifield). Probably less than one hundred copies were pressed, making it one of the rarest Beatles albums. Three sealed stereo copies were discovered in 1976, selling for $600, $900 and $1,800. One of the three was re-sold in 1995 for $22,000. Like many of the albums rushed out to cash in on the Beatles success, Jolly What! has been called a \"rip-off\", due to its intentional misleading of buyers. The album consisted entirely of studio recordings (not live, and thus not \"on stage\"), and all the Beatles material had been previously released. The album is also known for a mistake in the liner notes: \"It is with a good deal of pride and pleasure that this copulation has been presented\"\u2014presumably \"copulation\" should have been \"compilation\". (In confirming the matter, Snopes.com noted that \"copulation\" was appropriate, since the makers of the album were \"trying to screw the fans out of their money.\") The album, however, was significant in that, until the release of the Beatles' 1973 compilation album, The Beatles/1962-1966, Jolly What! was the only American Beatles album to include \"From Me to You\"."@en ;

For some of her fans this album is a return to her roots. It has drawn favorable comparisons to Innamoramento and also the albums prior to Anamorphos\u00E9e. This album seems to depict the artist as a woman at her prime, confident in her achievements and able to express herself without sacrificing her integrity. Farmer has written the lyrics and Moby, Archive and RedOne have composed the music for the album. The first single from the album is \"Oui mais... non\", composed by RedOne. The single was released on 11 October 2010. The music video of \"Leila\" premiered at the album's temporary website on 22 November 2010, but there has not been any plan to release the song as a single. The album entered the French Digital Chart at number one, with over 9,100 downloads. The next week, the album also entered the physical chart at number one, selling 139,176 units in the first week. Both performances were deemed as records in terms of sales. Bleu noir is Farmer's first studio album since 1991's L'Autre to outperform its predecessor in terms of national sales. On 22 January 2011, it was revealed that the second single would be the title track of the same name and will be released the following month. However, the release of the single was delayed due to the production of remixes of \"Bleu noir\". The music video of \"Bleu noir\" premiered at the album's temporary website on 16 March 2011.

It was her first release, by default, on Casablanca Records. In 1981, oil magnate and industrialist Marvin Davis (1925\u20132004) and financier Marc Rich (1934\u20132013) bought Twentieth Century-Fox Film Corporation, which owned her previous label, 20th Century-Fox Records, for a grand total of $703 million. However, Davis expressed disinterest in buying the record company and thus sold the record label to PolyGram earlier that year. PolyGram, a European conglomerate that was buying up US record labels as fast as they could make deals, immediately shut down the label, and had all of its artists' contracts and reissues (including Mills') transferred to their Casablanca imprint, which they had owned since owning 50% of the company in 1977. PolyGram bought the other 50% in 1980, the same year Mills recorded the LP Sweet Sensation."@en ;

Like their previous album, Innerspeaker (2010), Lonerism was written, recorded, performed, and produced by Kevin Parker, with live member Jay Watson contributing on two tracks. Recorded mostly in Perth, Australia, and Paris, France, Lonerism builds on the psychedelic sound of its predecessor by featuring fewer guitars and more synthesisers and samples. Parker attempted to incorporate his love for pop music into his songwriting for the record through catchier melodies. Many tracks feature ambient sounds recorded by Parker with a dictaphone. The album's theme of isolation is reflected in the album cover, featuring an image of a fenced-off Jardin du Luxembourg in Paris. Lonerism was widely acclaimed by critics, many of whom ranked it among the best albums of 2012. It reached number four on the charts in Australia, number 14 in the United Kingdom, and number 34 in the United States. It has sold 210,000 copies in the United States, and is certified platinum in Australia and silver in the UK. At the 2013 ARIA Awards, Lonerism won Best Rock Album and Album of the Year, while at the 56th Annual Grammy Awards, it was nominated for Best Alternative Music Album. Three singles were released, including \"Elephant\" and \"Feels Like We Only Go Backwards\", which charted in several countries."@en ;

The album showcases Ghostface's signature up-tempo, stream-of-consciousness rhyme style, and features guest appearances from Cappadonna, GZA, Masta Killa, Method Man, Raekwon, Redman, RZA, U-God, and others. It features affiliates of what would become members of Theodore Unit and T.M.F. Supreme Clientele contains a large amount of production from group member RZA, who also re-worked and remixed beats from other producers involved, as a means to create a unified and cohesive sound for the album. Upon its release, Supreme Clientele debuted at number seven on the Billboard 200 chart and number two on the Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart, while selling 134,000 copies in its first week. On March 8, 2000, it was certified Gold in sales by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). The album featured the singles \"Apollo Kids\" and \"Cherchez La Ghost\", which, despite receiving limited airplay, went on to achieve notable chart success. Supreme Clientele was met with mostly strong reviews from music critics, despite its contrasting sound and style to that of his previous album, Ironman (1996). It was praised and noted for Ghostface Killah's obscure and creative lyricism, and for the cohesive format of production. Supreme Clientele was the most acclaimed of all the second generation Wu-Tang projects, and featured the most contributions from RZA during this era. Along with Ironman and Fishscale (2006), it is often ranked as Ghostface Killah's best work. It has also been regarded as one of the best solo Wu-Tang albums, and has received accolades for being one of the best albums of the 2000's decade."@en ;

The album's lyrics were heavily inspired by the new family lives of both brothers since Plumb, with at least two songs being explicitly addressed to the brothers' children (\"The Morning Is Waiting\" and \"Stay Awake\"), and it was Peter's son's love of Hall & Oates and American number-one singles that shaped the less fractured, more accessible structure and style of the album. Elsewhere, \"Trouble at the Lights\" is described as being about Peter Brewis's \"dislike of Range Rovers and the political class of people who seem to drive them\". Lead single, \"The Noisy Days Are Over\", received a brief endorsement by musician Prince on Twitter."@en ;

The album features Ross' versions of songs from the film version of the musical The Wiz, in which she starred along with Michael Jackson. The songs were originally recorded in 1978, produced by Ross, Suzanne de Passe and Grammy Award winner Lee Holdridge. Motown originally planned to release the album in 1979 (a year after the film's original soundtrack) but it was cancelled following low box office returns and highly negative critical response to the film. Ross recorded new versions of \"Be a Lion\" and \"Home\" for the album, together with a previously unreleased song, \"Wonder, Wonder Why\". Home had been released as part of a 2001 Motown compilation album, while a different version of \"Ease on Down the Road\" had been released in 1978 as a duet with Michael Jackson. All other tracks remained unreleased until 2015. The reissue was remastered and produced by Andrew Skurow, George Solomon, and Harry Weinger. The album was released ahead of the premiere of The Wiz Live! (a new adaptation of the 1975 Broadway musical) with newcomer Shanice Williams reprising Ross' role of Dorothy (originally played by Stephanie Mills in the original broadway play) in the television special that was seen by 11.5 million viewers on NBC."@en ;

The album's sound was heavily inspired by Cult Leader's cover of \"You Are Not My Blood\" found on Useless Animal, originally by the indie/folk collaboration between Mark Kozelek and Desertshore from their eponymous 2013 album, Mark Kozelek & Desertshore. Vocalist Anthony Lucero sees himself as being \"in the same vocal range\" as musicians such as Tom Waits, Nick Cave and Michael Gira, and the fruitful sessions that resulted in \"You Are Not My Blood\" encouraged Cult Leader to incorporate more of these styling into their metal/punk sound. Lucero said Lightless Walk saw Cult Leader exploring how to write songs that incorporated these two textural elements to balance each other out. He elaborated: \"There has to be some sort of silver lining existing somewhere in the world to counterbalance depression. And I tend to write about that a lot.\" Lyrically, Lightless Walk explores ideas of depression, isolation, sadness and hope."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"No Chance Baby! is a retrospective album by the American garage rock band Oscar and the Majestics and was released on July 26, 2011 on Sundazed Records. The album compiles all of the group's released material that was previously available to only a handful of collectors. During their heyday, Oscar and the Majestics enjoyed regional success under the leadership of lead guitarist and vocalist Oscar Hamod. Marked by their utilization of distorted guitar instrumentals, the group eventually signed a recording contract with USA Records. Though the three singles recorded during this stint exemplified Oscar and the Majestics' growth as musicians, the record label's capitulation prevented the band from reaching a national audience. Further releases followed on independent record labels, however by 1969 the group disbanded with their surviving singles, particularly those distributed by USA, becoming prizes among record collectors. The band's music was beginning to be uncovered thanks to five of their tracks being compiled on 2131 South Michigan Avenue: 60's Garage & Psychedelia from USA and Destination Records in 2009. No Chance Baby! opens with \"Got to Have Your Lovin'\", an Oscar Hamod-penned song that exemplifies the band's transitional period into psychedelia. Another track by Hamod, \"No Chance Baby\", is a favorite among Oscar and the Majestics' original material and was the first on the USA label. Much of the album's contents resembles the group's influences taken from the Kinks and the Who, particularly in their early R&B compositions. Another musical highlight is \"House of the Rising Sun 1969\" which showed the band's utilization of fuzz-toned instrumentals coming full circle. The two songs, \"Baby Under My Skin\u201D and \u201CI Feel Good\u201D, were previously unreleased recordings from the group's USA stint. Upon release, No Chance Baby! revived Oscar and the Majestics' complete discography, and another reunion of former band members. The album was ranked at number three on Rolling Stone Magazine's list of reissue albums."@en ;

It is the first album by the band to have two guitarists (Marcelo Donida and Maur\u00EDcio Nogueira) and it is also the last to feature bassist China. It was recorded at Tambor Studios, in Rio de Janeiro, and it was produced by Rafael Ramos, who also produced Nheengatu by Tit\u00E3s and Setevidas by Pitty. It was released on 14 April 2015. All instruments were recorded simultaneously. On 18 March, the band announced the second video from the album, \"O que Est\u00E1 Feito, Est\u00E1 Feito\", recorded in Rio de Janeiro. On 24 March, they released the track \"Matadouro 18\" at Tenho Mais Discos Que Amigos!. Then, on 1 April, they released \"Orgulho e Cinismo\" at Rolling Stone Brasil and \"Chance pro Azar\" at R\u00E1dio Cidade on 6 April. About the darker themes of the album, in comparison with their typical lyrics about drinking and women, vocalist Jimmy London said: \"We create the concept of each Matanza album even before we write the first song. Now, however, it would be required to live in Mars to talk about a good mess, celebratory gunfire and fun. Who knows if we won't be in a better mood in the next work.\" About adding a second guitarist, he said: \"It's one more instrument, and that means, 20% plus arranging, noise and pressure capacity. We had a process of recording similar to the other albums. We attempted to keep the sound organic, making the drums sound as if they were right there beside you, and so on. However, with each work, we improve that process. In this moment, we used the tape machine to heat up the sound, but without actually recording on it. What's the fun if everything was the same, after all?\""@en ;

The film stars Ranbir Kapoor and Deepika Padukone in lead roles. The album features nine tracks, and was released on October 16, 2015 by T-Series. The music in the film is narrative, in the form of impresarios, depicting emotions of the characters. The songs cover genres like European dance, bhangra, opera, Hindustani classical and dubstep apart from experimental fusion of genres. Upon release, music critics not only praised the trio\u2013director, composer and lyricist for coming up with classy, catchy and commercial numbers but also censured the soundtrack album, calling the treatment to the album as irreverent and hangover of previous works Highway and Rockstar. The track \"Matargashti\" was released as the first single prior to the soundtrack album release. The tracks \"Matargashti\" and \"Tum Saath Ho\" were the chart toppers on the Indian Music Charts, majority of the critics praising the track \"Matargashti\". The soundtrack was adjudged as one of the best albums of 2015, wherein A. R.

The album is the third album from Paul van Dyk's legendary compilation The Politics of Dancing series (the first was released on 2001 and the second on 2005). Paul van Dyk said about the album : \u201CThe third Politics of Dancing\u2019s sound is, to me, more about what I\u2019m about than the first two albums even. With them, I took music from other people and mixed, remixed and articulated it into the releases. Now we\u2019re talking about tracks that I\u2019ve written and co-written with other artists. So this is pretty much my idea of what electronic music should sound like now. \"Politics\" is almost like a \"sound dictionary\" of where I\u2019m at musically. For me it continues the theme/thread of the first two, whilst acknowledging the passage of time between the then and the now.\u201D. The album including a serie of 7 singles as Come With Me (We Are One) (with Ummet Ozcan), Lights (featuring Sue McLaren), Guardian (with Aly & Fila featuring Sue McLaren) and Louder (with Roger Shah featuring Daphne Khoo)."@en ;

Deutsch in the liner notes as explanation for the exclusion of the hit singles \"Misty\" from 1959's Heavenly and his \"Too Much, Too Little, Too Late\" duet with Deniece Williams from You Light Up My Life in 1978. Deutsch excuses these as \"songs extracted from specific albums to call attention to these albums.\" The set does, however, include \"Ten Times Forever\" and \"I Was There\" from his first 1971 LP, Love Story, and a shorter version of \"If We Only Have Love\" than the one that was included on his other 1971 album, You've Got a Friend."@en ;

Producer Tibor Rudas claimed prior to the concert that 2 billion viewers were expected to watch the televised performance worldwide. As in their two previous recorded concerts in Rome in 1990 and Los Angeles in 1994, Spanish tenors Carreras and Domingo and their Italian colleague Pavarotti performed a variety of operatic arias, Neapolitan songs, zarzuela romanzas, art songs, and popular music.

The second single, \"Revelator Eyes\", followed in September with a video directed by Dan Huiting. The album was written entirely between the hours of midnight and 4 a.m. due to the creativity lead singer and songwriter Sam Bentley felt arose during this time. For this reason, it has been referred to as a concept album. The album was then recorded in Seattle with American producer Phil Ek (Fleet Foxes, Band of Horses) over six weeks in March and April 2015. The band chose Ek to create a more upbeat sound compared to their previous releases, incorporating electric guitars and synthesizers into their music. twelvefour debuted at number 8 on the Australian ARIA Albums Chart on 5 September. The band embarked on a tour of Australia from 16 October to 8 November in support of the album. They then toured the United States and Canada across November and December 2015, and will tour Europe in 2016.

Released through Deathwish Inc. on June 16, 2015, the EP features two exclusive tracks (the original composition \"Useless Animal,\" and the cover song \"You Are Not My Blood\") and one original composition titled \"Gutter Gods\" that would later be released on the band's 2015 debut album, Lightless Walk. Useless Animal was recorded in late 2014 by Andy Patterson, who previously recorded Gaza's 2009 album, He Is Never Coming Back\u2014the now-defunct band that featured three members and gave birth to Cult Leader. Music critics noted the first two tracks, \"Useless Animal\" and \"Gutter Gods,\" sounded both familiar and exemplary of Cult Leader's signature sound. Writing for Exclaim, Denise Falzon gave the EP a nine-out-of-ten and called these two tracks: \"raw, chaotic attacks of heavy, grinding noise filled with furious, tormented aggression.\" Writing for SLUG Magazine, Megan Kennedy praised the EP and said these two tracks, \"are short tracks, like brutal slashes with rusty blades, but there is so much energy and atmosphere in their frantic, ugly rhythms.\" Many critics highly praised the EP's B-side \"You Are Not My Blood,\" a cover song originally by the indie/folk collaboration between Mark Kozelek and Desertshore from their eponymous 2013 album, Mark Kozelek & Desertshore. Cult Leader was joined on the cover song by Kim Pack and Sarah Pendleton of the fellow Salt Late City-based doom/sludge metal band Subrosa, who Falzon called \"superbly talented.\" She elaborated that the track, \"pairs surprisingly well with the jarring, distorted hostility of the first two numbers, and takes Useless Animal to another level entirely. Kennedy called the song \"the stand-out track\" of the EP, described Anthony Lucero's singing vocals as \"an enjoyable surprise\" and said the additional Subrosa members helped Cult Leader \"showcase their range with this deep, brooding dirge.\" Michael Nelson of Stereogum described the song as, \"a dirge-y, doom-y thing that pretty seamlessly combines both Cult Leader and SubRosa's sounds, actually\u2014and pays fitting homage to Kozelek\u2019s sound, too.\""@en ;

The album was produced by Tim Palmer, who has previously worked with artists such as David Bowie, Robert Plant, The Cure, U2 and Pearl Jam and had mixed Blue October's album History for Sale. The artwork on the album cover is a drawing of Justin Furstenfeld drawn by Tim Palmer's daughter Bluebell, who was three years old at the time. The songs on the album are largely about Justin Furstenfeld's divorce and custody battle over his daughter. The first single from the album, The Chills became available for digital download May 31, and impacted radio June 27, 2011. On June 9, 2011 the band posted a video of the song The Feel Again (Stay), directed by Merritt Fields, on YouTube. Due to the overwhelming positive response to the video by fans, the band released the song on iTunes five days later. On Monday, July 25, 2011, the official music video for the first single, The Chills, was released via the band's YouTube Vevo channel. Upon release, the album topped the amazon.com album downloads chart. The album sold 27,275 copies in its first week, making it the highest-selling debut, the highest-selling alternative rock album, the second highest-selling independent album, and the eighth best selling album overall. Additionally, the album was popular on iTunes where it was the best selling alternative album, and the fifth best selling album overall. The album debuted at number eight on the Billboard chart, making it the highest charting album of Blue October's career, although their two previous studio albums actually sold more units in their first week of release."@en ;

dbr:Believers_Never_Die_-_Greatest_Hits	rdf:type	schema:MusicAlbum ;
	dbo:abstract	"Believers Never Die \u2013 Greatest Hits is the first greatest hits album by American rock band Fall Out Boy. Released on November 17, 2009 in the United States by Island Records, it contains all of the songs the band had released as singles to that point in their career, in chronological order, as well as two new songs and two rarities. It is available as a CD or CD/DVD set with music videos. The album features an original wraparound illustration by artist Daniel Danger. The artwork was revealed on October 9. Believers Never Die was released after Fall Out Boy toured as support for blink-182's 2009 summer reunion tour and shortly before Fall Out Boy announced an indefinite hiatus in late 2009. Of the two new songs, \"Alpha Dog\" was released as a single on October 26, 2009 and peaked at #60 in Australia. A demo version of it was on the Welcome to the New Administration mixtape, under the name \"ALPHAdog and OMEGAlomaniac\". Believers Never Die was generally received positively by critics. It appeared on the charts in some countries but its commercial success was limited. In 2013, the greatest hits set was followed up with Save Rock and Roll, the band's first studio album since Folie \u00E0 Deux (2008). In February 2014, Believers Never Die was certified Silver in the UK by the BPI, and was upgraded to Gold in October 2015 for 100,000 copies shipped."@en ;
