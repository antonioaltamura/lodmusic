	dbo:abstract	"Marc Cerrone (born 1952 in Vitry-sur-Seine, near Paris, France) is an Italofrench disco drummer, composer, record producer and creator of major concert shows. Cerrone is considered as one of the most influential disco producers of the 70s and 80s in Europe. He has sold over 30 million records worldwide, including over four million copies in France alone and eight million copies of Supernature, which is considered his magnum opus. The single \"Love in C Minor\" (1976) reached No. 3 and stayed on record charts for over two months, chalking up sales of three million copies. With \"Supernature\" (1977), Cerrone merged symphonic orchestrations with the rigid sounds of synthesizers. At the 1978 Billboard Disco Forum, Cerrone took home six awards including Disco Artist of the Year. In addition to Love in C Minor, Cerrone's Paradise and Supernature, Marc Cerrone enjoyed success in Europe with albums such as Cerrone IV: The Golden Touch (1978), Where Are You Now (1983), The Collector (1985), Human Nature (1994) and more recently with the dance albums Hysteria (2002) and Celebrate (2007). Cerrone is also known for his huge live performances. In 1991, the French composer was entrusted with the task of laying on the show \"Harmony\" to celebrate the launch of Japan's first high-definition TV satellite. The rock opera was therein presented to over 800,000 spectators at the Tokyo harbour. This event recorded such success that Broadway asked Cerrone to adapt \"Harmony\" for theatre. In 1992, the musical Dreamtime which was based on an original story by Cerrone ran for 140 shows on Broadway at New York's Ed Sullivan Theater. In a career spanning over four decades, Cerrone has recorded and performed with many prominent musicians, including Nile Rodgers, Toto, Laura Branigan, Jocelyn Brown, La Toya Jackson and Axelle Red. His music has been sampled by artists such as Modjo, Bob Sinclar, The Beastie Boys and Run\u2013D.M.C.."@en ;

Born in Austin, Texas, she traveled around the world during her childhood, eventually moving to Atlanta, Georgia where she joined the girl group Hearsay (not to be confused with the British group Hear'Say); however, the group disbanded after having differences. It was at this time Ciara was noticed for her songwriting. In 2002, Ciara met music producer Jazze Pha. With his help, she signed a record deal with LaFace Records. In 2004, Ciara released her debut studio album Goodies, which spawned three hit singles: \"Goodies\", \"1, 2 Step\", and \"Oh\". The album was certified triple platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), and earned her four nominations at the 48th Annual Grammy Awards. She released her second studio album, Ciara: The Evolution, in 2006 which spawned the hit singles \"Get Up\", \"Promise\", and \"Like a Boy\". The album reached number one in the U.S. and was certified platinum. Her third studio album, Fantasy Ride, released in 2009, was considerably less successful than Ciara's first two albums. However, it produced the international top-ten single \"Love Sex Magic\" featuring Justin Timberlake, which earned her a Grammy Award nomination for Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals. The following year, Ciara released her fourth studio album Basic Instinct, which was met with low sales and continued a downward trend in her commercial performance. In 2011, she signed a new record deal with Epic Records, and released her self-titled fifth studio album, Ciara, in 2013 which was preceded by the U.S. R&B/Hip-Hop top-ten single\"Body Party\". In 2015, Ciara released her sixth album Jackie, which included the singles \"I Bet\" and \"Dance Like We're Making Love\". The album debuted at number 17 on the Billboard 200 and sold 19,000 copies, which made it her lowest first-week album sales to date. Ciara has also transitioned into acting in 2006 she made her film debut it All You've Got, followed by Mama, I Want to Sing! (2012) and That's My Boy (2012). In 2013, Ciara had a recurring role in the US TV series, The Game. Since making her musical debut in 2004, Ciara has attained eight Billboard Hot 100 top-ten singles, including a number one. She has also earned numerous awards and accolades, including three BET Awards, three MTV Video Music Awards, three MOBO Awards, and one Grammy Award.

	dbo:abstract	"Erno \"Emppu\" Matti Juhani Vuorinen (born 24 June 1978, in Kitee, Finland) is a Finnish guitarist, most famous for being a founding member and occasional songwriter of the symphonic metal band Nightwish. He is the oldest of five children, having a twin brother and three younger sisters. He started to play guitar as a private study at the age of 12 and since then has played in various bands including Nightwish, Brother Firetribe, Barilari, Almah, and Altaria. Emppu is primarily a rhythm player, often supporting the keyboard or orchestral parts of Nightwish songs. However, he plays lead melodies and solos as well. Vuorinen's solo techniques usually include alternate picking, tapping, sliding, legato, and minor to extreme whammy bar use; he also employs sweep picking, although very rarely. His solos are more melodic than those of most metal bands, but he sometimes shreds (notably in \"Nightquest,\" \"The Pharaoh Sails to Orion,\" \"Romanticide,\" and \"Gethsemane\" by Nightwish, and also in \"Traitor\" by Tarot, for which he provided a solo). Nightwish's first three albums feature a larger amount of lead guitar work from Emppu than their later albums. Vuorinen has tuned his studio guitars in D tuning since the release of Century Child \u2013 until then, his guitars were tuned in standard. During concerts, he has two guitars \u2013 one for each tuning. Vuorinen is also a creative force in Nightwish, having co-written songs with Tuomas Holopainen from Oceanborn until Dark Passion Play. The song Whoever Brings The Night on Dark Passion Play is written by Vuorinen alone. Emppu recorded guitar parts for Almah, a Brazilian metal band, order to help his friend and vocalist Edu Falaschi (former singer of Angra). Emppu did not stay in the band because of his obligations to Nightwish. He is also involved with Brother Firetribe, an AOR band, which as of 2008 has released three albums worldwide: \"False Metal\" (re-released as \"Break Out\"), \"Heart Full Of Fire\" and \"Diamond In The Firepit\". Vuorinen is often referred to as \"the short one\" or \"the hobbit\" when among band members or fans, as he stands at just 5'3\" (162 cm) in height."@en ;

The name Jovanotti derives from the plural form of the Italian word giovanotto (\"young man\"), i.e., giovanotti. Cherubini initially chose \"Joe Vanotti\" as his stage name, but a promotional poster for a night club incorrectly billed him as \"Jovanotti\" and the name stuck. (The spelling Jovanotti is anglicized; the letter J is rarely used in Italian) Jovanotti is commonly known to his fans by the diminutive form \"Jova\", and often refers to himself that way in promotional items and on his Web TV channel Jova.TV, which launched October 2, 2014. Jovanotti gradually departed from his early mix of hip hop, rap and disco, taking in funk, world music and even classical arrangements and ska influences. As his musical influences changed, so too did his lyrics, which over time began to increasingly address philosophical, religious and political issues, which are more typical of the Italian cantautore tradition. His social and political commitment increased as well. Some of his earlier work is also closer to keyboard-heavy 1980s pop. Most of his songs are sung in Italian; he also released a Spanish-language greatest hits album. His live album includes a short version of the Sugarhill Gang's \"Rapper's Delight.\" Jovanotti appears on several international compilations, most notably Red Hot + Rhapsody, a 1998 tribute to George Gershwin, on which he performed \"I Got Rhythm\". Jovanotti also appeared in one of Luciano Pavarotti's charity concerts in 1996."@en .

His given name may also be cited as Kheaven, a spelling he later adopted. The alias \"k-os\", spelled with a lower case \"k\", was intended to be less aggressive than the pseudonyms of other rappers whose names were all upper case, such as KRS-One.

The lyrics frequently focus on promoting a \"positive message\" while at times expressing criticism of mainstream hip hop culture's obsession with money, fame and glorification of violence.A musician as well as a producer, k-os has written and produced nearly every part of all four of his albums. k-os usually performs with a live band, something that is uncommon in the hip hop genre. He sometimes plays guitar and keyboard both during live performances and in the studio. k-os received his first musical exposure with the single \"Musical Essence\", released in 1993. After the release of his second single \"Rise Like the Sun\" in 1996, he withdrew from the industry because he was dissatisfied with his musical style.

As of 2012, K\u00F6zi is in the bands Dalle, My Horror Revue, XA-VAT and ZIZ, while occasionally working on his solo career. During his time in Malice Mizer, K\u00F6zi often assumed the role of a pierrot doll, dressing in clown-like costumes with large ruffs, always in shades of red, his favourite colour. In music videos and on-stage he would often make movements reminiscent of a marionette (string puppet). K\u00F6zi has continued this visual style to some extent, but his contemporary stage costumes are more gothic. His work on the Izayoi no Tsuki project was reminiscent of carnival music, and artwork for his projects usually follow a dramatic, theatrical theme.

Born and raised in Erfurt, Thuringia, she later moved to Leipzig to pursue her music career on the University of Music and Theatre. In 2000, she participated in the debut season of the singing competition series Stimme 2000, where she came in second place. Catterfeld subsequently signed a recording deal with Hansa Records, which released her debut single \"Bum\" in 2001. The same year, she was propelled to stardom when she was cast in a main role in the German soap opera Gute Zeiten, schlechte Zeiten. In 2003, Catterfeld made her musical breakthrough when her fifth single, \"F\u00FCr dich\", became an international number-one hit and produced the equally successful album Meine Welt. Catterfeld continued booking success with follow-up albums Farben meiner Welt (2004) and Unterwegs (2005), which spawned the hit singles \"Du hast mein Herz gebrochen\" and \"Glaub an mich\". Following her departure from GZSZ and a starring role in the short-living telenovela Sophie \u2013 Braut wider Willen, she released her fourth album Aura, which was less successful commercially and led to a decline in her musical career. She transitioned to Sony Music, and after an unsuccessful period, returned to the top of music charts with the reissue of her sixth album Lieber so (2013), when she appeared in the second season of Sing meinen Song - Das Tauschkonzert, the German version of the The Best Singers series, Throughout a career spanning 15 years, Catterfeld has sold over 800,000 records as a solo artist, making her one of the best-selling German music artists of all time. Aside from her commercial accomplishments, her work has earned her numerous awards and accolades, including a Bambi Award, a Goldene Stimmgabel, and an ECHO Award. An established actress, she has appeared in several international television and theatrical films, including Keinohrhasen (2007), The Promise (2011), and Beauty and the Beast (2014).

He is best known as an interpreter of the blatnaya pesnya (criminal song) genre. Modern singers in this genre, such as Mikhail Shufutinsky often sing Rosenbaum's songs. Rosenbaum graduated from the First Pavlov State Medical University of St. Peterburg in 1974, and worked in the medical field for four years. His musical education consists of piano and choreography courses at a musical school. In 1968, while still a student, Rosenbaum started writing the songs for which he is famous. His early songs were for student plays, but he soon also wrote for rock groups and started performing as a singer-songwriter in 1983, sometimes under the pseudonym \"Ayarov\". Among his most famous songs are the ones about Leningrad, the Soviet-Afghan War, Cossacks, and the Jewish Mafia in Odessa. Songs such as \"Gop-Stop\" (a comedy about two gangsters executing an unfaithful lover) and \"Vals-boston\" (The Boston Waltz) are popular across Russian social groups and generations. Rosenbaum accompanies himself on either a six- or twelve-string acoustic guitar, using the Open G tuning adopted from the Russian seven string guitar. His attitude toward the criminal song genre can best be illustrated by his own words:"@en ;

Born in Cyprus, she studied music at conservatories and performed locally before moving to the professional scene in Athens, Greece in 1973, where she signed with Minos and simultaneously collaborated with other musical artists and released promotional singles of her own while studying at the University of Athens. Vissi established herself in the recording industry by winning the Thessaloniki Song Festival in 1977 with the song \"As Kanoume Apopse Mian Arhi\" and releasing her debut album of the same name. Since the 1980s, Vissi began a nearly exclusive collaboration with songwriter Nikos Karvelas, to whom she was married to from 1983\u20131992 and had one child with, resulting in one of the most successful music partnerships in the nation's history. Together they created the label CarVi, which resulted in legal issues with EMI Greece, and they then moved to CBS Records Greece, which later became Sony Music Greece. Over the course of her career she has released over two dozen albums, most of which have been certified at least gold in the two countries and has also starred in three theatrical productions and briefly ventured into television and radio. Vissi experimented with different styles of music; after becoming one of the first Greek artists to introduce Western pop and dance elements into Greek la\u00EFko and entehno, she became one of the most prominent portrayers of the la\u00EFko-pop hybrid genre and culture that was thriving from the mid-1990s into the mid-2000s. She landed her biggest commercial success with Fotia (1989), followed by the double Kravgi (2000), which became the best-selling album of the 2000s decade and eighth best-selling of all time in terms of units, while five others \u2013 Kitrino Galazio (1979), I Epomeni Kinisi (1985), Klima Tropiko (1996), Travma (1997), and Antidoto (1998) \u2013 have also achieved six figure sales. She has a large number of successful singles most of which have become classics, including her signature song \"Dodeka\", \"Methismeni Politia\", \"Pragmata\", \"Agapi Ipervoliki\", \"Pseftika\", \"Ta Mathitika Hronia\", \"Stin Pira\", \"Gazi\" and many many more. Through the years she kept a strong fan base, sold out toursand shows (as was her latests shows in Rex in winter 2011\u201312 and Hotel Ermou 2015-2016 which was the most successful the of the year). Since the late 1990s, Vissi has also made attempts at establishing a career abroad, most of which fell through and have had some negative repercussions on her domestic career. However, she struck some success with her 2005 single \"Call Me\", which made her the first Greek or Cypriot artist to top the US Billboard Hot Dance Club Play Chart and has also represented Greece in the Eurovision Song Contest in 1980 and 2006, and Cyprus in 1982. While her performance for Cyprus remains the highest placement the country has ever received in the contest, her Greek performances were less successful. Through a career that has spanned nearly four decades, Vissi has influenced several of the nation's younger generation of female artists. She has won six Arion Music Awards, 15 Pop Corn Music Awards, and nine MAD Video Music Awards. Vissi has received 32 Platinum and 11 Gold certifications from IFPI Greece and has become one of the country's best-selling artists of all time, having sold over 9.5 million records worldwide and is also one of the country's top earning artists. She has 114,000,000 total views in YouTube.

He has been a member in long standing of the weekly Grand Ole Opry radio program and stage performance in Nashville, Tennessee.

Twenty-nine more of his singles have reached the top ten. One of the most successful songwriters in country music history, Anderson is also a popular singer, earning the nickname \"Whisperin' Bill\" for his soft vocal style and occasional spoken narrations. Artists who have recorded his material include Ray Price, Wanda Jackson, Connie Smith, Lynn Anderson, Jim Reeves, Conway Twitty, Eddy Arnold, Roy Clark, Con Hunley, Lefty Frizzell, Brad Paisley, Kenny Chesney, and George Strait. Bill Anderson had his own television show in the 1960s. Anderson has made several television appearances, including two stints as a game show host: The Better Sex (with co-host Sarah Purcell) in 1977, and the country music-themed quiz show Fandango (1983\u20131989) on The Nashville Network.

	dbo:abstract	"Boris Dlugosch is a house music producer from Germany. Boris is usually known for funky/deep house tracks, mostly produced in conjunction with Mousse T. and Michi Lange, his partners in the Peppermint Jam Records label. Boris Dlugosch started his career as a DJ in the German night club Front. Dlugosch differed from his countrymen by playing house music tracks, instead of happy hardcore or trance, more established in Germany. As a producer, however, Dlugosch's first works, in the early 1990s, were in the happy hardcore genre, working alongside Gary D. Dlugosch had a few occasional hits in the club circuit in the 1990s, beginning with the two tracks created with Mousse T. under the Booom! moniker, \"Hold Your Head Up High\" and \"Keep Pushin'\", with vocals by Inaya Day, and \"Check It Out (Everybody)\", under the alias BMR (a regular partnership with Michi Lange). More recently, Dlugosch's name achieved some fame in the year 1999 thanks to his remix of Moloko's \"Sing It Back\", which became a club music phenomenon. He followed up under his own name with \"Never Enough\", a track that featured the voice of Moloko's vocalist R\u00F3is\u00EDn Murphy. It peaked at #16 in the UK Singles Chart in June 2001. Boris Dlugosch has also remixed dozens of songs, including Mariah Carey, Mary J. Blige, Italian rapper Jovanotti, disco band First Choice, and other well-known electronic music artists such as A-ha, R\u00F6yksopp, Moloko and Daft Punk."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Boris Novkovi\u0107 (born 25 December 1967) is a Croatian pop singer. He was born in Sarajevo, while it was a part of the former Yugoslavia. His interest in a musical career was cultivated by his family background, with a mother who taught music, and a father, \u0110or\u0111e Novkovi\u0107, who was a leading Croatian songwriter and music manager. He released his first album, Kuda idu izgubljene djevojke in 1986, selling 120,000 copies, while his follow-up release in 1987, Ja\u010Di od sudbine, was more successful still. Two more successful albums followed: Dok svira radio in 1988 and Obojeni snovi in 1989. In 1990 he narrowly missed out on the chance to represent Yugoslavia at the Eurovision Song Contest with the song \"Dajana\", but his second-place finish in the national pre-selection instead secured him a place at the International festival in Kuala Lumpur. Seven more albums followed up to 2003, as well as two \"best of\" compilations, but few songs were able to match the popularity of the early ones. Perhaps most notable are Struji Struja from the eponymous 1993 album, \"Sve mijenja se\" from U dobru i u zlu (1995), and \"Daleko\" from the 1997 album Sve gubi sjaj bez ljubavi. In 2005, fifteen years after his near miss in the Yugoslav pre-selection, Novkovi\u0107 won the right to represent the now independent Croatia at the Eurovision Song Contest. He performed his song \"Vukovi umiru sami\" (\"Wolves die alone\") together with members of the Lado ensemble. To win the Dora pre-selection competition on 5 March 2005, they had to vanquish an impressive array of former Croatian Eurovision representatives, including Magazin, Danijela Martinovi\u0107, Vesna Pisarovi\u0107 and Goran Karan. Despite the respectable showing of Croatia's 2004 Eurovision entry \"You Are The Only One\", the country did not achieve a high enough placing to qualify automatically for the 2005 grand final. Thus Boris' song was performed in the semifinal, where it finished 4th with 169 points, qualifying for the final. Novkovi\u0107 represented the country in the Eurovision Song Contest 2005 in Kiev and finished 11th with 115 points."@en .

After becoming a born again Christian, Welch left the band in 2005 to focus on life as a father and to pursue his own solo career. He released his debut Christian album, Save Me from Myself, in 2008. He reunited with Korn on-stage at the Carolina Rebellion on May 5, 2012 for the first time in seven years, and on May 2, 2013, officially announced rejoining the band.

	dbo:abstract	"At the age of fifteen years old, Cox began working as a mobile DJ, finding a passion for disco music. He began his music career around the same time that Chicago house music found its forefront in the world of dance music. He eventually became known as one of the founders of that sound and rode the exploding British rave scene. Following the beginning of his DJ career, he became one of the only DJs known to utilize three-deck mixing. Cox has performed at clubs such as The Eclipse, Edge, Shelly's, Sterns Nightclub, Heaven, Sir Henry's in Cork, Ireland and Angels and The Ha\u00E7ienda, as well as raves for Fantazia, Dreamscape, NASA and Amnesia House. In the early 1990s, he decided that it was time to begin producing music, which is when he released his debut single for Paul Oakenfold's Perfecto label, \"I Want You (Forever).\" Cox became known as one of the best \"celebrity DJs\" in the world, and he continued to create music, eventually embracing the underground sounds of techno that would soon become very popular. He ran Ultimate Base at the now defunct Velvet Underground club on Charing Cross Road, London in the mid-to late 1990s. Cox also played the Millennium (1999 to 2000) on New Year's Eve twice, by performing in Sydney, Australia and again in Hawaii after flying back over the International Date Line. He was also global resident DJ for BBC Radio 1's Essential Mix in 1998\u201399 and he has also broadcast over a decade's-worth of Ibiza live mixes from Space. In 1997, DJ Magazine chose Cox as the first #1 DJ for its first top 100 poll, which to this day still takes place. Cox formed his own record label, Intec Records in 1998. From 1999 to 2006, Intec Records released a myriad of underground hits and became one of the best in dance music. However, in 2006 he decided to temporarily put the label on a brief hiatus and relaunched it in 2010 as Intec Digital. In 2001, Cox began his residency at Space Ibiza, which has taken place every summer on the White Isle. In 2004, he debuted the Carl Cox & Friends arena at Ultra Music Festival, which has since taken place for twelve years. In the film, \"Can U Feel It?\", a documentary about Ultra Music Festival, Carl explains that the concept of Carl Cox & Friends came about as a result of not only wanting to play longer sets at festivals, but also to give festival goers an experience within the festival, as Carl has far more creative control over his own stage. The stage is wildly popular with festival goers, and has featured artists like Laurent Garnier, Nic Fanciulli, Loco Dice, Marco Carola, Maceo Plex, and many more. In late 2015, Carl announced that 2016 will be his last year hosting a summer residency at Space Ibiza, as the club is officially closing and he has realized that Ibiza isn't the same as it used to be. The final season of Carl's residency at Space Ibiza is entitled \"The Final Chapter\" and took place every Tuesday during the summer of 2016. Carl finished his residency at Space Ibiza on 20 September 2016 by playing a vinyl and CDJ, ten hour set. Artists who joined Cox on his final night as part of his residency at Space Ibiza included tINI, Popof, Nic Fanciulli, and DJ Sneak. Cox will also be playing Space Ibiza's official closing fiesta on 2 October 2016 with Tale of Us, Anja Schneider, and Darius Syrossian confirmed so far. Space Ibiza announced more artists for its closing fiesta on 22 August 2016 and that includes Josh Wink, Steve Bug, Roger Sanchez, Maceo Plex, and many more."@en ;

She has earned numerous accolades, including seven Grammy Awards, 17 Billboard Music Awards, 12 Academy of Country Music Awards, nine American Music Awards and a Guinness World Record. Her debut album, Some Hearts, was released in 2005. Bolstered by the huge crossover success of the singles \"Jesus, Take the Wheel\" and \"Before He Cheats\", it became the fastest selling debut country album in Nielsen SoundScan history, the best-selling solo female debut album in country music history and the best-selling country album of the last ten years. Underwood won three Grammy Awards for the album, including Best New Artist. Released in 2007, her second album, Carnival Ride, had one of the biggest ever opening weeks by a female artist and earned Underwood two Grammy Awards. Her next album, 2009's Play On, was a commercial success led by the single \"Cowboy Casanova\". Underwood's fourth album, Blown Away (2012), earned her a Grammy Award and was that year's second best-selling release by a female artist.

He hosted the weekday morning \"DJ Laz Morning Show\" in Miami on WPOW 96.5 FM, branded \"Power 96,\" for 22 years until he left the company in April 2012. Beginning July 4, 2012, the new DJ Laz Morning Show began after arbitration on the newly reformatted WRMA DJ106.7 a Bilingual Dance/Rhythmic formatted station. He is best known for his albums DJ Laz and Category 6, which charted on U.S. Billboard album charts. He is also notable for the singles \"Journey Into Bass\" (1994) and \"Move Shake Drop\" (2008), which peaked at #56 on the Billboard Hot 100. The DJ Laz Morning Show on LA 96.3 of Los Angeles and DJ 106.7 of Miami is known for mysteriously getting their hands on exclusive content. DJ Laz is also known for his show's prominent appearance on Fox's television show, Dish Nation. In July 2012, when Justin Bieber made a 911 call to authorities to report paparazzi that were following him, the DJ Laz Morning Show was the first to obtain Bieber's 911 call, airing it on Los Angeles' LA 96.3. On Tuesday, September 11, 2012, the DJ Laz Morning Show aired a pre-recorded interview with President Barack Obama. Many Obama critics quickly bashed Obama for making no mention to the September 11 attacks in 2001, despite the fact that the interview was pre-recorded. The White House later made it clear that the call was indeed pre-recorded and was supposed to have been played on Monday, September 10. On May 5, 2014, DJ Laz was in command of a boat that was stuck on a sand bar in Biscayne Bay. When bystanders got out to push the boat, DJ Laz increased power to the engine, and a 23-year-old man who had been trying to help was killed by the boat prop."@en ;

An early interest in hip hop led to his using the turntables, practicing often. Kibler was also interested in funk and jazz music, and began collaborating with various musicians. His own recordings are perhaps best described as contemporary soul jazz with a strong hip hop feel. Kibler tours often with his own group, Project Logic, and has recorded or performed with Vernon Reid, moe., John Mayer, Medeski Martin & Wood, Bob Belden, Jack Johnson, Chris Whitley, Uri Caine, Christian McBride and others. On April 6, 2006, Kibler sat in with Bob Weir's Ratdog, adding his style to the famous Grateful Dead song combo \"China Cat Sunflower/I Know You Rider\". He is a founding member of The John Popper Project. On August 15, 2009, Kibler sat in with O.A.R. at Madison Square Garden, adding his style to their latest single \"This Town\". His mentor was Vernon Reid, and the twosome recorded and toured occasionally as the Yohimbe Brothers with various guests. Kibler has appeared on studio and live performances with Reid's solo projects, and Reid also did a guest solo on one track from Kibler's original band, Eye and I, which also featured D.K. Dyson and Melvin Gibbs, the latter of which has played on all of the DJ Logic solo releases as well."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"David Clayton-Thomas (born David Henry Thomsett; 13 September 1941) is a Grammy Award-winning Canadian musician, singer and songwriter, best known as the lead vocalist of the American band Blood, Sweat & Tears. Clayton-Thomas has been inducted into the Canadian Music Hall of Fame and in 2007 his jazz/rock composition \"Spinning Wheel\" was enshrined in the Canadian Songwriter's Hall of Fame. In 2010 Clayton-Thomas received his star on Canada's Walk of Fame. Clayton-Thomas began his music career in the early '60s, working the clubs on Toronto's Yonge Street, where he discovered his love of singing and playing the blues. Before moving to New York City in 1967, Clayton-Thomas fronted a couple of local bands, first The Shays and then The Bossmen, one of the earliest rock bands with significant jazz influences. But the real success came only a few difficult years later when he joined Blood, Sweat & Tears. Clayton-Thomas's first album with the band, Blood, Sweat & Tears (which was released in December 1968) \u2013 despite the self-titled name, actually the band's second album \u2013 sold ten million copies worldwide. The record topped the Billboard album chart for seven weeks, and charted for 109 weeks. It won five Grammy Awards, including Album of the Year and Best Performance by a Male Vocalist. It featured three hit singles, \"You Made Me So Very Happy\", \"Spinning Wheel\", \"And When I Die\" (on the Hot 100, each peaked at No. 2 and lasted 13 weeks) as well as a rendition of Billie Holiday's \"God Bless The Child\". With Clayton-Thomas fronting the band, BS&T continued with a string of hit albums, including Blood, Sweat & Tears 3 which featured Carole King's \"Hi-De-Ho\" and Clayton-Thomas's \"Lucretia MacEvil\", and Blood, Sweat & Tears 4, which yielded another Clayton-Thomas penned hit single, \"Go Down Gamblin'\" and \"Lisa Listen to Me\". In 1972 Thomas released his first Columbia solo album after BS&T, simply titled \"David Clayton Thomas\". In 1973 the second solo album Tequila Sunrise was issued by Columbia.

He has mastered such a wide variety of instruments that Acoustic Guitar magazine referred to Lindley, not as a multi-instrumentalist, but instead as a \"maxi-instrumentalist\" in a cover story about his career to date in 2005. The majority of the instruments that Lindley plays are string instruments. They include (but are not limited to) the acoustic and electric guitar, upright and electric bass guitar, banjo, lap steel guitar, mandolin, hardingfele, bouzouki, cittern, ba\u011Flama, gumbus, charango, c\u00FCmb\u00FC\u015F, oud, weissenborn, and zither. Lindley has performed as a member of the pioneering eclectic 1960s band Kaleidoscope, served as bandleader of his own band El Rayo-X, and has been hired to serve in that capacity for other artists on tour. In addition, he has occasionally scored and composed music for film."@en ;

Osmond went solo in the early 1970s, covering such hits as \"Go Away Little Girl\" and \"Puppy Love\". For over thirty-five years, he and younger sister Marie have gained fame as Donny & Marie, partly due to the success of their 1976\u201379 self-titled variety series, which aired on ABC. The duo also did a 1998\u20132000 talk show and have been headlining in Las Vegas since 2008. In 1989, Osmond had two big-selling recordings, the first of which, \"Soldier of Love\", was initially credited to a \"mystery artist\" by some radio stations. Starting in July 1992, Osmond played Joseph in the Elgin Theatre's Toronto production of Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat. The musical then toured North America until 1998. Creator Andrew Lloyd Webber, impressed by Osmond's talents and the show's successful six-year run, chose him for the 1999 film version. In 2009, Osmond won the ninth season of Dancing with the Stars. Osmond appeared as a guest judge on Strictly Come Dancing on week 3 (movie week) of the 12th series."@en ;

Formerly in the band Elviss, McConnell participates in a number of side-projects, such as the Phoenix Drive and playing double bass and piano with Irish singer/songwriter Fionn Regan as well as writing and recording solo material. McConnell organises a musical collective named Helsinki, with which he performs solo material as well as versions of songs by Babyshambles, such as a swing version of their single \"Delivery\". Among the members of this collective are Stephen Large of Squeeze and Albert Hammond Jr of The Strokes., the drummer Seb Rochford of Polar Bear and Acoustic Ladyland, drummer Jamie Morrison (of the Noisettes), guitarist Matt Parks, Jonnie Fielding (violin), Larrikin Love and Fionn Regan. McConnell completed a bass degree at the Institute of Contemporary Music Performance (ICMP). He also appears in the video \"Police on My Back\" by UK grime artist Lethal Bizzle, playing bass. McConnell is heavily involved with the Love Music Hate Racism movement, contributing a song with Babyshambles and Helsinki to a CD given away free with a copy of the NME in 2007, as well as playing at such events as the Love Music Hate Racism carnival with Jon McClure of Reverend and The Makers. McConnell also fronted the musical collective Mongrel with Jon McClure and members of Arctic Monkeys. In 2011, McConnell was in a near death accident where he was hit by a car breaking a red light and knocked off his bike, crushing his spine. He has since recovered and is quoted saying \"Humans are designed to deal with trauma of a physical and emotional kind. It's the stuff of life.\" On 5 May 2014 McConnell's Helsinki released its debut album \"Coast of Silence.\" Its 12 tracks included \"New Pair\" and \"The Very Last Boy Alive\" which have also been recorded by Babyshambles.

Born and raised in Sweden to Greek parents, she enrolled in various arts schools before launching a career in Sweden in 1999 as a member of the la\u00EFko (Greek folk music) and Eurodance duo Antique, who participated in the Eurovision Song Contest 2001 and afterwards became popular in Greece. Antique disbanded in 2003 and Paparizou signed a solo recording contract with Sony Music Greece, releasing the chart-topping debut single \"Anapandites Kliseis\" and album Protereotita (2004), with emphasis on la\u00EFko, pop, and dance sounds, but at first had modest sales. In 2005, she represented Greece in the Eurovision Song Contest with the song \"My Number One\", which she won. It was the first Greek win in the contest's history and significantly transformed her career. Her album was subsequently certified double platinum by the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry of Greece. Paparizou briefly attempted a career beyond Greece with English-language material, charting in a few countries abroad. Her three subsequent albums Iparhi Logos (2006), The Game of Love (2006) and Vrisko To Logo Na Zo (2008) all peaked at number one in Greece and reached platinum sales. Her fifth studio album Giro Apo T' Oneiro (2010) was also certified platinum. Paparizou's final release before she left Sony Music, Greatest Hits & More, was released in 2011 and included \"Baby It's Over\", her biggest airplay hit to date. Paparizou established herself as a teen idol, particularly among young girls. She has endorsed the brands Nokia and Ivi. For the period 2013-2015 Helena advertised hair colour products for Koleston company in Greece. In the 2010s she tried to move into television as a judge on Dancing on Ice (2011) and as a contestant on Let's Dance (2012) but saw little success. Paparizou lived with her fianc\u00E9 and manager Toni Mavridis from 1999 until their separation in 2011. Paparizou has been awarded three Arion Music Awards, a European Border Breakers Award, 23 MAD Video Music Awards\u2014more than any other artist\u2014and an MTV Europe Music Award. On 14 March 2010, Alpha TV ranked her as the 14th top-certified domestic female artist since 1960, having won seven platinum and four gold records. Paparizou was the most successful debuting female artist of the 2000s and established herself as one of the top acts of the latter half of the decade. As of 2010, she has been certified for the sales of 300,000 albums, 47,500 singles, and 30,000 digital downloads by IFPI Greece, in addition to 100,000 total record sales in Greece as part of Antique, 24,000 certified albums in Cyprus, and 80,000 singles in Sweden during her solo career.
