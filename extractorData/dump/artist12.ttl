He was an iconic figure in the cultural history of the Indian subcontinent. He was a mystic and a spiritual disciple of Nizamuddin Auliya of Delhi. Am\u012Br Khusrau is reputed to have invented certain musical instruments like the sitar and tabla. He wrote poetry primarily in Persian, but also in Hindavi. A vocabulary in verse, the \u1E32h\u0101liq B\u0101r\u012B, containing Arabic, Persian, and Hindavi terms is often attributed to him. He is regarded as the \"father of Qawwali\" (a devotional music form of the Sufis in the Indian subcontinent), and introduced the ghazal style of song into India, both of which still exist widely in India and Pakistan. He is also credited with introducing Persian, Arabic and Turkish elements into Indian classical music and was the originator of the khayal and tarana styles of music. Khusrau was an expert in many styles of Persian poetry which were developed in medieval Persia, from Kh\u0101q\u0101n\u012B's qasidas to Nizami's khamsa. He used 11 metrical schemes with 35 distinct divisions. He has written in many verse forms including ghazal, masnavi, qata, rubai, do-baiti and tarkib-band. His contribution to the development of the g\u035Fhazal, is significant."@en ;

Born in Norway to a Norwegian mother and a German father, she grew up in Sweden and reached international stardom as a member of the pop group ABBA, which has sold over 380 million albums and singles worldwide, making them one of the best-selling music artists in history. After the break-up of ABBA, she continued an international solo singing career with mixed success. In 1996, Frida recorded her final album before 'retiring' from music. She now focuses on environmental issues. In April 1964, aged 18 she married Ragnar Fredriksson. Immediately after their divorce in 1970, Lyngstad courted eventual ABBA band member Benny Andersson, co-habiting until they officially married in 1978.

	dbo:abstract	"Ashley Nicolle Naess (n\u00E9e Simpson; born October 3, 1984), known by the stage name Ashlee Simpson, is an American singer-songwriter, actress, and media personality. The younger sister of pop singer and actress Jessica Simpson, Ashlee began appearing in television commercials at the age of 15. She later pursued a career as an actress, and had a recurring role on the family drama 7th Heaven. Her breakout came following her appearance on the reality show Newlyweds: Nick and Jessica (2003\u201305), which focused on her sister Jessica and her then-husband Nick Lachey. While working on her debut studio album, Simpson became the star of her own spin-off reality series, The Ashlee Simpson Show (2004\u201305). The show became a ratings hit, and earned Simpson widespread recognition. Like her sister before her, Simpson became the center of considerable media attention, much of which focused on her relationship with musician Ryan Cabrera. Simpson's debut single, \"Pieces of Me\" (2004), became a top five hit in the United States, and topped the Billboard Mainstream Top 40 chart based on radio airplay. The success of the single and her reality show helped propel her debut album, Autobiography (2004), to the top of the Billboard 200 albums chart. The project went on to sell over five million copies worldwide, making it her most successful album to date. Simpson had a leading role in the film Undiscovered (2005), which became a critical and commercial flop. The failure of the film, along with multiple critically panned performances, led to much media scrutiny towards Simpson. Despite this, Simpson's second studio album, I Am Me (2005), debuted atop the Billboard 200, becoming her second album to do so. The album went on to receive a platinum certification from the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). In 2006, Simpson began a relationship with Fall Out Boy member Pete Wentz, which gained much media attention. Following her appearance as Roxie Hart in the West End production of Chicago, Simpson announced that she had begun working on her third studio album. The album differed from the pop-rock sound of her previous efforts, featuring a dance-pop and 1980s themed sound. Bittersweet World (2008) was released to positive critical reception, but saw a decline in sales for Simpson. The effort reached number 4 on the Billboard 200, and went on to sell 126,000 copies by 2009. Simpson announced her engagement to Wentz in April 2008, with the pair wedding the following month. Two weeks after the wedding Simpson announced her pregnancy, thus ending promotion of Bittersweet World. Simpson and Wentz welcomed a son in November 2008. The following year, Simpson joined the main cast of the Melrose Place revamp, though was met with harsh critical reception. She later portrayed Roxie Hart in Chicago on Broadway. Simpson announced her separation from Wentz in 2011, citing irreconcilable differences. Despite having taken time to focus on being a mother, Simpson announced a fourth studio album that same year. She independently released the single \"Bat for a Heart\" (2012), though it failed to have success. Simpson has since scrapped the album, and focused on her child. She began dating actor Evan Ross in 2013, with the couple marrying in August 2014. Months later the two announced that Simpson was expecting a second child, and in July 2015 she gave birth to a baby girl."@en ;

Hamasaki has achieved popularity in Japan and Asia by enforcing her position as an artist and not trying to be forced as a \"product\", which was a common factor within the Japanese music culture and Avex Trax. Through her entire career, she has written all her lyrical content, produced her own music and has sometimes co-composed her music, which is evident in her albums I Am..., Rainbow and My Story. Born and raised in Fukuoka, she moved to Tokyo at fourteen in 1993 to pursue a career in singing and acting for her entertainment. In 1998, under the tutelage of Avex CEO Max Matsuura, Hamasaki released her debut single \"Poker Face\" and released her million-selling record A Song for XX. The album debuted at the top of the Oricon charts and remained there for four weeks, establishing her popularity in Japan. Her next five albums accomplished over one million shipments in Japan, with her third effort Duty selling near three million units, becoming her best selling studio album. A Best, her first compilation album, is her best selling album, with more than four million copies sold in Japan. In 2008, after her album Next Level was released, album and single sales declined due to ongoing competition with new upcoming artists. Throughout her career, Hamasaki has had all her albums within the top five position in Japan and has five million-selling singles, including \"Boys & Girls\", \"A\", \"Seasons\", \"M\" and \"H\". Also called \"Ayu\" by her fans, Hamasaki has been dubbed the \"Empress of J-pop\" because of her popularity and widespread influence in Japan and throughout Asia. Hamasaki's constantly changing image and tight control over her artistry has helped her popularity extend across Asia; music and fashion trends she has started have spread regionally to China, Singapore and other countries across Southeast Asia. She has appeared in or lent her songs to many advertisements and television commercials. Though she originally supported the exploitation of her popularity for commercial purposes, she later reconsidered and eventually opposed her status as an Avex \"product\". Hamasaki has sold over 51 million records, making her one of the best-selling artists in Japan. Hamasaki has several domestic record achievements for her singles, such as the most number-one hits by a female artist (38); the most consecutive number-one hits by a solo artist (twenty-five), and the most million-sellers. From 1999 to 2010, Hamasaki had at least one single each year topping the charts. Hamasaki is the first female recording artist to have eight studio albums since her debut to top the Oricon and the first artist to have a number-one album for 13 consecutive years since her debut. Hamasaki's second remix album, Super Eurobeat Presents Ayu-ro Mix, is recognized as one of the best selling remix albums of all time and remains her only album to be recognized in a worldwide accreditation."@en ;

Evans' use of impressionist harmony, inventive interpretation of traditional jazz repertoire, block chords, and trademark rhythmically independent, \"singing\" melodic lines continue to influence jazz pianists today. Born in Plainfield, New Jersey in 1929, he was classically trained, and studied at Southeastern Louisiana University. In 1955, he moved to New York City, where he worked with bandleader and theorist George Russell. In 1958, Evans joined Miles Davis's sextet, where he was to have a profound influence. In 1959, the band, then immersed in modal jazz, recorded Kind of Blue, the best-selling jazz album of all time. In late 1959, Evans left the Miles Davis band and began his career as a leader with Scott LaFaro and Paul Motian, a group now regarded as a seminal modern jazz trio. In 1961, ten days after recording the highly acclaimed Sunday at the Village Vanguard and Waltz for Debby, LaFaro died in a car accident. After months of seclusion, Evans re-emerged with a new trio, featuring bassist Chuck Israels. In 1963, Evans recorded Conversations with Myself, an innovative solo album using the unconventional (in jazz solo recordings) technique of overdubbing over himself. In 1966, he met bassist Eddie G\u00F3mez, with whom he would work for eleven years. Several successful albums followed, such as Bill Evans at the Montreux Jazz Festival, Alone and The Bill Evans Album, among others. Many of his compositions, such as \"Waltz for Debby\", have become standards and have been played and recorded by many artists. Evans was honored with 31 Grammy nominations and seven awards, and was inducted in the Down Beat Jazz Hall of Fame."@en ;

Formed by Corgan and guitarist James Iha in Chicago, Illinois, in 1988, the band quickly gained steam with the addition of bassist D'arcy Wretzky and drummer Jimmy Chamberlin. Strong album sales and large-scale tours propelled the band's increasing fame in the 1990s until their break-up in 2000. Corgan started a new band called Zwan, and after their quick demise, he released a solo album (TheFutureEmbrace) and a collection of poetry (Blinking with Fists) before setting his sights on reforming Smashing Pumpkins. The new version of Smashing Pumpkins, consisting of Corgan and a revolving lineup, has released and toured new albums extensively since the 2007 reunion album, Zeitgeist. In 2011, Corgan entered the world of professional wrestling, founding Chicago-based indie professional wrestling promotion Resistance Pro Wrestling.

As Blue Swede, the band had a #1 hit on Billboard Hot 100 in 1974 with a cover of \"Hooked on a Feeling\". Bj\u00F6rn Skifs left the band in 1976 to pursue a solo career. He recorded the duet \"Med varann\" with Anni-Frid Lyngstad for his 1975 album Schiffz. Skifs appeared as The Arbiter on the original studio album for Chess, released in 1984. A single and video, \"The Arbiter's Song\" was released in 1985. Skifs also recorded several demos for the album, including \"One Night in Bangkok\", later performed by Murray Head. Skifs did not perform the role on stage; in the original London production the character was played by Tom Jobe. Povel Ramel gave Skifs the Karamelodiktstipendiet stipend in 1984. Bj\u00F6rn Skifs represented Sweden twice in the Eurovision Song Contest, both in the 1978 contest and in the 1981 contest.

He is best known as the frontman of the influential alternative rock band Pixies, with whom he performs under the stage name Black Francis. Following the band's breakup in 1993, he embarked on a solo career under the name Frank Black. After releasing two albums with record label 4AD and one with American Recordings, he left the label and formed a new band, Frank Black and the Catholics. He re-adopted the name Black Francis in 2007. His vocal style has varied from a screaming, yowling delivery as lead vocalist of the Pixies to a more measured and melodic style in his solo career. His cryptic lyrics mostly explore unconventional subjects, such as surrealism, incest and biblical violence, along with science fiction and surf culture. His use of atypical meter signatures, loud\u2013quiet dynamics and distinct preference for live-to-two-track recording in his career as a solo artist give him a distinct style within alternative rock. As frontman of the Pixies, his songs (such as \"Where Is My Mind?\" and \"Debaser\") received praise and citations from contemporaries, including Radiohead's Thom Yorke and Nirvana's Kurt Cobain. Cobain once said that \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\" was his attempt to \"rip off the Pixies\". Thompson reformed the Pixies in 2004 and continues to release solo records and tour as a solo artist."@en ;

As a locally successful Detroit-area artist, he performed and recorded as Bob Seger and the Last Heard and Bob Seger System throughout the 1960s. By the early 1970s, he had dropped the \"System\" from his recordings and continued to strive for broader success with various other bands. In 1973, he put together the Silver Bullet Band, with a group of Detroit-area musicians, with whom he became most successful on the national level with the album Live Bullet, recorded live with the Silver Bullet Band in 1975 at Cobo Hall in Detroit, Michigan. In 1976, he achieved a national breakout with the studio album Night Moves. On his studio albums, he also worked extensively with the Alabama-based Muscle Shoals Rhythm Section, which appeared on several of Seger's best-selling singles and albums. A roots rocker with a classic raspy, shouting voice, Seger wrote and recorded songs that deal with love, women and blue-collar themes and is an exemplar of heartland rock.

Seger also co-wrote the Eagles' number-one hit \"Heartache Tonight\", and his iconic recording of \"Old Time Rock and Roll\" was named one of the Songs of the Century in 2001. With a career spanning six decades, Seger continues to perform and record today. Seger was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2004 and the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 2012.

He performed in a range of musical genres, including jazz, pop, rock 'n' roll, folk, swing, and country. He started as a songwriter for Connie Francis, and recorded his own first million-seller \"Splish Splash\" in 1958. This was followed by \"Dream Lover,\" \"Mack the Knife,\" and \"Beyond the Sea,\" which brought him world fame. In 1962, he won a Golden Globe Award for his first film Come September, co-starring his first wife, Sandra Dee. Throughout the 1960s, he became more politically active and worked on Robert F. Kennedy's Democratic presidential campaign. He was present on the night of June 4/5, 1968, at the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles at the time of Kennedy's assassination. The same year, he discovered that he had been brought up by his grandmother, not his mother, and that the girl he had thought to be his sister was actually his mother. These events deeply affected Darin and sent him into a long period of seclusion. Although he made a successful television comeback, his health was beginning to fail, as he had always expected, following bouts of rheumatic fever in childhood. This knowledge of his vulnerability had always spurred him on to exploit his musical talent while still young. He died at age 37, following a heart operation in Los Angeles."@en ;

He was born in Forfar and lived in Kirriemuir, Scotland, for 5 years before moving to Melbourne, with his family in 1952 at the age of six. The family lived in the suburb of Sunshine for four years before moving to Fremantle, Western Australia. Scott formed his first band, The Spektors, in 1964 and became the band's drummer and occasional lead vocalist.He performed in several other bands including The Valentines and Fraternitybefore replacing Dave Evans as the lead singer of AC/DC in 1974. In the July 2004 issue of Classic Rock, Scott was rated as number one in a list of the\"100 Greatest Frontmen Of All Time\" ahead of Freddie Mercury and Robert Plant. Hit Parader ranked Scott as fifth on their 2006 list of the 100 Greatest Heavy Metal Vocalists of all time. AC/DC's popularity grew throughout the 1970s, initially in Australia, and then internationally. Their 1979 album Highway to Hell reached the top twenty in the United States, and the band seemed on the verge of a commercial breakthrough. However, on 19 February 1980, Scott died after a night out in London. AC/DC briefly considered disbanding, but the group recruited vocalist Brian Johnson of the British glam rock band Geordie. AC/DC's subsequent album, Back in Black, was released only five months later, and was a tribute to Scott. It went on to become the second best-selling album in history."@en ;

Born into a musical family in McComb, Mississippi and raised in Carson, California, she began her career as a child and performed as a backing vocalist for teen groups. In 1993, Norwood signed with Atlantic Records. The following year, she released her self-titled debut album, which was certified quadruple Platinum in the US, selling six million copies worldwide. Norwood starred in the UPN sitcom Moesha as the title character, which lasted six seasons and resulted in numerous other roles. She resumed her music career in 1998 with the widely successful duet with fellow R&B contemporary Monica, \"The Boy Is Mine\", which went on to become the best selling female duet of all time, and one of the longest running number one singles in history. Her second album, Never Say Never sold 16 million copies worldwide, featured two number one singles, and earned Norwood her first Grammy Award. This launched her into international stardom, with films, endorsements, sold out concert tours, and her own line of Barbie dolls. Throughout the 2000s, Norwood held a precarious position in the pop industry. In 2002, she starred in the reality series Brandy: Special Delivery, documenting the birth of her daughter. Her third and fourth albums, Full Moon (2002) and Afrodisiac (2004), were released to critical and commercial success. She served as a judge on the first season of America's Got Talent before being involved in a widely publicized car accident in 2006. After several lawsuits stemming from the accident, Norwood's fifth album Human (2008) was released to commercial failure. In the 2010s, Norwood received a critical and commercial resurgence. In 2010, she returned to television as a contestant on the eleventh season of Dancing with the Stars and starred in the reality series Brandy & Ray J: A Family Business. In 2012 she became a series regular in the BET series The Game, and released her sixth album Two Eleven to critical praise. In April 2015, Norwood made her Broadway debut in the musical Chicago. She starred in and executive produced a new sitcom Zoe Ever After on the BET network in January 2016. Throughout her career, she has sold over 40 million records worldwide, making her one of the best selling female artists of all time. The Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) lists Norwood as one of the top selling artists in the United States, with 10.5 million certified albums. Her work has earned her numerous awards and accolades, including a Grammy Award, one American Music Award, and seven Billboard Music Awards. She has become known for her distinctive sound, characterized by her peculiar timbre, voice-layering, intricate riffs, which has earned her the nickname 'The Vocal Bible' from industry peers and critics."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Brian Samuel Epstein (/\u025Bpsta\u026An/; 19 September 1934 \u2013 27 August 1967) was an English music entrepreneur, best known for managing the Beatles. Epstein first discovered the Beatles in November 1961 during a lunchtime Cavern Club performance. He was instantly impressed and saw great potential in the group. Epstein was rejected by nearly all major recording companies in London, until he secured a meeting with George Martin, head of EMI's Parlophone label. In May 1962, Martin agreed to sign the Beatles, partly because of Epstein's conviction that the group would become internationally famous. The Beatles' early success has been attributed to Epstein's management style, and the band trusted him without hesitation. In addition to handling the Beatles' business affairs, Epstein often stepped in to mediate personal disputes within the group. The Beatles' unquestioning loyalty to Epstein later proved detrimental, as the band rarely read contracts before signing them. Shortly after the song \"Please Please Me\" rose to the top of the charts in 1963, Epstein advised the creation of Northern Songs, a publishing company that would control the copyrights of all Lennon\u2013McCartney compositions recorded between 1963 and 1973. Music publisher Dick James and his partner Charles Silver owned 51-percent of the company, Lennon and McCartney each owned 20%, and Epstein owned 9%. By 1969, Lennon and McCartney had lost control of all publishing rights to ATV Music Publishing. Still, Epstein's death in 1967 marked the beginning of the group's dissolution and had a profound effect on each Beatle. In 1997, Paul McCartney said, \"If anyone was the Fifth Beatle, it was Brian.\" Epstein's influence on the Beatles and his complicated personal life continue to provoke controversy. In 2013, author Vivek Tiwary released the graphic novel The Fifth Beatle: The Brian Epstein Story. A film of the same name was scheduled for release in 2014, originally to be produced by Bruce Cohen and directed by Peyton Reed. Tiwary said about that project that the film would \"be less a music bio and more of an inspirational human-interest story about an outsider\". Tiwary and named co-producers Stuart Ford and Simon Cowell originally set the film for release in 2016, but in March 2016 it was announced that the project would be a television series."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Brian Francis Johnson (born 5 October 1947) is an English singer and songwriter. In 1980 he became the third lead singer of the Australian rock band AC/DC after the death of their second lead singer Bon Scott. He and the rest of the band were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2003. In March of 2016 Johnson stepped down from touring on the Rock or Bust World Tour due to hearing problems. On 20 May 2016, Johnson stated in an interview \"I've had a pretty good run\" in AC/DC and implied that he might not be returning by saying \"I'm just thankful, really, that I came out of it in one piece.\" Johnson was one of the founder members of the rock band Geordie formed in Newcastle in 1971. After a few hit singles, including UK Top 10 \"All Because of You\" (1973), the band split up in 1978. Following the death of AC/DC frontman Bon Scott on 19 February 1980, Johnson was asked to audition for the band in London. AC/DC lead guitarist and co-founder Angus Young recalled: \"I remember Bon playing me Little Richard, and then telling me the story of when he saw Brian singing [with Geordie].\" He says about that night: \"There's this guy up there screaming at the top of his lungs and then the next thing you know he hits the deck. He's on the floor, rolling around and screaming. I thought it was great, and then to top it off \u2013 you couldn't get a better encore \u2013 they came in and wheeled the guy off!'\" Johnson was diagnosed with appendicitis later that night, which was the cause of his writhing around on stage. The band agreed immediately that Johnson's performing style fit AC/DC's music. Johnson's first album with AC/DC, Back in Black, became the second best-selling album worldwide according to some estimates."@en ;

He also established a distinctive image and sartorial style; according to The Independent, Ferry and his contemporary David Bowie influenced a generation with both their music and their appearance. Ferry came to prominence as the lead vocalist and principal songwriter with the glam art rock band Roxy Music, achieving three number one albums and ten top ten singles in the UK between 1972 and 1982. Their singles included \"Virginia Plain\", \"Street Life\", \"Love is the Drug\", \"Dance Away\", \"Angel Eyes\", \"Over You\", \"Oh Yeah\", \"Jealous Guy\" and \"More Than This\". Ferry began his solo career in 1973. His solo hits included \"A Hard Rain's a-Gonna Fall\", \"Let's Stick Together\" and \"This Is Tomorrow\". After disbanding Roxy Music, Ferry concentrated on his solo career, releasing further singles such as \"Slave to Love\" and \"Don't Stop the Dance\". As well as being a prolific songwriter himself, Ferry has also gained attention for his many cover versions of other artists' songs and for his re-working of standards, especially from the Great American Songbook, in albums such as These Foolish Things (1973), Another Time, Another Place (1974) and As Time Goes By (1999). When his sales as a solo artist and as a member of Roxy Music are combined, Ferry has sold over 30 million albums worldwide."@en ;

His songs are influenced by French chanson and a heavy influence is placed on the piano or the accordion and on typical French fanfare (brass band) for the most upbeat of them. This genre of music is very typically French and differs from most in that emphasis is placed on appreciation of the lyrics and that it is linked to a specific culture of modern \"guinche\" (slang for \"guinguette\") appreciated a lot by Bobos among others."@en ;

Veloso first became known for his participation in the Brazilian musical movement Tropicalismo, which encompassed theatre, poetry and music in the 1960s, at the beginning of the Brazilian military dictatorship. He has remained a constant creative influence and best-selling performing artist and composer ever since. Veloso has won nine Latin Grammy Awards and two Grammy Awards. On November 14, 2012, Veloso was honored as the Latin Recording Academy Person of the Year. Veloso was one of seven children born into the family of Jos\u00E9 Telles Velloso (Seu Zeca), a government official, and Claudionor Viana Telles Veloso (Dona Can\u00F4), a housewife. He was born in the city of Santo Amaro da Purifica\u00E7\u00E3o, in Bahia, a state in the northeastern area of Brazil, but moved to Salvador, the state capital, as a college student in the mid-1960s. Soon after the move, Veloso won a music contest and was signed to his first label. He became one of the founders of Tropicalismo with a group of several other musicians and artists\u2014including his sister Maria Beth\u00E2nia\u2014in the same period. However the Brazilian government at the time viewed Veloso's music and political action as threatening, and he was arrested, along with fellow musician Gilberto Gil, in 1969. The two eventually were exiled from Brazil, and went to London, where they lived for two years. After he moved back to his home country, in 1972, Veloso once again began recording and performing, becoming popular outside of Brazil in the 1980s and 1990s."@en ;

Influenced by the guitar playing of Chuck Berry and the Ventures, Carl's initial role in the group was that of lead guitarist and backing vocals, but he performed lead vocals on several of their hits, including \"God Only Knows\" (1966) and \"Good Vibrations\" (1967). Unlike other members of the band, he often played alongside the studio musicians employed during the group's critical and commercial peak in the mid 1960s. After Brian began withdrawing from the group, Carl was forced to take a more active production role, and he became the band's musical director on stage from 1965 until his death from lung cancer in 1998. During the 1980s, he attempted to launch a solo career, releasing the albums Carl Wilson (1981) and Young Blood (1983). Shortly before his death, he recorded material with Gerry Beckley and Robert Lamm, later released for the posthumous album Like a Brother (2000). In 1988, Carl was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of the Beach Boys."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Chris Murphy (born November 7, 1968, in Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island, Canada) is a member of the Canadian rock band Sloan. Although born in Prince Edward Island, Murphy is commonly associated with Nova Scotia; like his bandmates, he currently resides in Toronto. He helped form the band with Jay Ferguson and is currently the band's bassist and lead singer, occasionally switching to drums or guitar. Murphy has written several Sloan songs that have been released as singles, including \"Underwhelmed\" from the album Smeared, \"Coax Me\" from Twice Removed, \"G Turns to D\" from One Chord to Another, \"She Says What She Means\" from Navy Blues, \"The Other Man\" from Pretty Together, and \"The Rest of My Life\" from Action Pact. In December 2005, Chris began hosting a show on CBC Radio 3 with Sloan bandmate Jay Ferguson. Their show was broadcast Saturdays and Sundays on Sirius Satellite Radio station (channel 94). The show has been on hiatus since November 2006. Murphy has also been featured as a guest juror on the show Video on Trial. Murphy and his girlfriend, Rebecca Mendoza, have a son named Francisco, who was featured on Entertainment Tonight on December 7, 2007. The two also have another son named Santiago. In July 2009, Murphy was hit by a car in a hit and run collision while riding his bicycle in Toronto, breaking his collarbone. The incident lent its name to Sloan's subsequent release, the Hit & Run EP. In 2010, Murphy served as the music coach for the actors in the film Scott Pilgrim vs. The World. The character Todd Ingram plays a red Fender Mustang Bass with white racing stripe, similar to Murphy's. As of 2015, he has joined with Mike O'Neill of The Inbreds and Matt Murphy of The Super Friendz in the supergroup Tuns."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Christopher Russell Edward Squire (4 March 1948 \u2013 27 June 2015) was an English musician, singer and songwriter. He was best known as the bassist and founding member of the progressive rock band Yes. He was the only member to appear on each of their 21 studio albums, released from 1969 to 2014. Born in the Kingsbury area of London, Squire took an early interest in church music and sang in the local church and school choirs. After he took up the bass guitar at age sixteen, his earliest gigs were in 1964 for The Selfs, which later evolved into The Syn. In 1968, Squire formed Yes with singer Jon Anderson; he would remain the band's sole bassist for the next 47 years. Squire was widely regarded as the dominant bassist among the English progressive rock bands, influencing peers and later generations of bassists with his incisive sound and elaborately contoured, melodic bass lines. His name was associated with his trademark instrument, the Rickenbacker 4001. In May 2015, Squire announced a hiatus from Yes after he was diagnosed with acute erythroid leukemia and subsequently died on 27 June at his home in Phoenix, Arizona. The band's first show of their tour with Toto on 7 August 2015 marked the first Yes concert ever performed without Squire. From 1991 to 2000, Rickenbacker produced a limited edition signature model bass in his name, the 4001CS. Squire released two solo albums, Fish Out of Water (1975) and Chris Squire's Swiss Choir (2007), a Christmas album."@en ;

At the age of 19, Milian signed a contract with Def Jam. In 2001, Milian released her self-titled debut album, which featured the singles \"AM to PM\" and \"When You Look at Me\"; \"AM to PM\" charted within the Top 40 of the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 and both peaked in the top three on the UK Singles Chart. In 2004, Milian released her second studio album It's About Time, which provided her first major U.S. hit, \"Dip It Low\", which reached number five on the U.S. Billboard chart. \"Whatever U Want\" was released as the album's second single. Both singles charted within the Top 10 of the UK chart. In 2006, Milian released her third studio album So Amazin'. The album produced one single, \"Say I\", which peaked in the Top 30 of the US Billboard chart. A month after the release of So Amazin', Milian's representative confirmed that she had left Island Records due to creative differences. Milian signed with Interscope Records in 2009. A single, ballad \"Us Against the World\", was released in October 2008. In 2012, Milian signed to Young Money Entertainment, which will release her fourth studio album. Although Milian is best known for her singing career, she originally wanted to be an actress. Her first lead role was in the 2003 film Love Don't Cost a Thing, and she subsequently had main roles in Be Cool and the 2006 horror film Pulse.

In 1986 Pine's debut album Journey to the Urge Within entered the UK Top 40. He is the principal Founder of the seminal black British big band the Jazz Warriors which he established in 1985 through the community organisation The Abibi Jazz Arts (TAJA). The Jazz Warriors developed out of the Abibi All-Stars community band which did a series of performances at London's Royal Festival Hall foyer during the summer of the International Youth Year 1985. The Jazz Warriors recorded two albums under Pine's leadership: Out of Many, One People which was released on the Antilles division of the Island Records label in 1987 and Afropeans which was released on his own label, Destin-e Records for their 20th anniversary in 2007. The Jazz Warriors Afropeans project was commissioned by the Arts Council of England to commemorate the bicentennary of the Abolition of the Slave Trade Act. Thirty years after Pine planted his idea to start the Jazz Warriors, he put together the Venus Warriors all-female jazz band for a charity performance to raise awareness of the Mary Seacole Memorial Statue Appeal which has been established to erect the first statue of a black heroine outside of London's St Thomas's Hospital. His recent music integrates modern British music like drum and bass and UK garage with contemporary jazz styles. He runs his own band and integrates many contemporary musicians in his performances. He also presents Jazz Crusade on BBC Radio 2, the seventh series of which was broadcast during spring 2007. In 1988 he appeared as himself in a jazz quartet in the Doctor Who serial Silver Nemesis. Pine was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in 2000, and Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 2009 New Year Honours for services to jazz music. He was also awarded an honorary doctorate from the University of Westminster on 6 December 2004. He was awarded an honorary doctorate from the University of Southampton on 15 July 2010. Pine appeared in August 2008 as an advocate for Pierre Boulez, on the BBC World News classical music programme, Visionaries."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Curtis Lee Mayfield (June 3, 1942 \u2013 December 26, 1999) was an American singer-songwriter, guitarist, and record producer, and one of the most influential musicians behind soul and politically conscious African-American music. He first achieved success and recognition with The Impressions during the Civil Rights Movement of the late 1950s and 1960s, and later worked as a solo artist. Born in Chicago, Illinois, Mayfield started his musical career in a gospel choir. Moving to the North Side he met Jerry Butler in 1956 at the age of 14, and joined vocal group The Impressions. As a songwriter, Mayfield became noted as one of the first musicians to bring more prevalent themes of social awareness into soul music. In 1965, he wrote \"People Get Ready\" for The Impressions, which displayed his more politically charged songwriting. Ranked at no. 24 on Rolling Stone's list of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time, the song received numerous other awards, and was included in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll, as well as being inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 1998. After leaving The Impressions in 1970 in the pursuit of a solo career, Mayfield released several albums, including the soundtrack for the blaxploitation film Super Fly in 1972. The soundtrack was noted for its socially conscious themes, mostly addressing problems surrounding inner city minorities such as crime, poverty and drug abuse. The album was ranked at no. 72 on Rolling Stone's list of 500 Greatest Albums of All Time. Mayfield was paralyzed from the neck down after lighting equipment fell on him during a live performance at Wingate Field in Flatbush, Brooklyn, New York, on August 13, 1990. Despite this, he continued his career as a recording artist, releasing his final album New World Order in 1997. Mayfield won a Grammy Legend Award in 1994 and a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 1995, and was a double inductee into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, as a member of the Impressions in 1991, and again in 1999 as a solo artist. He was also a two-time Grammy Hall of Fame inductee. He died from complications of type 2 diabetes in 1999 at the age of 57."@en ;

Hayes was the frontman and singer of the pop duo Savage Garden until its breakup in 2002, whose 1997 album Savage Garden peaked at No. 1 in Australia, No. 2 in United Kingdom and No. 3 in United States. It spawned the singles \"I Want You\", \"To the Moon and Back\", and Australian and US No. 1 \"Truly Madly Deeply\". The duo followed the success of their debut album with Affirmation (1999), which provided additional hits such as US No. 1 \"I Knew I Loved You\", and Australian No. 3 \"The Animal Song\". Savage Garden sold more than 23 million albums worldwide before parting ways in 2001. Hayes released his first solo album Spin in 2002. The album sold two million copies worldwide, debuted at No. 2 in the UK and No. 3 in Australia. It delivered the hit single \"Insatiable\". Hayes's second solo album The Tension and the Spark marked a change of direction for the singer-songwriter, showing experimentation with electronica and darker lyrics. NME wrote about its first single, \"Pop!ular\" saying it was \"A twistered masterclass in career reintervention...This guy is a genius.\" While The Observer said \"This album is no folly and succeeds, often to the point of all out triumph, on its own terms.\" Hayes parted way with his record label Columbia Records in 2006 and started his own independent record label, Powdered Sugar, from which he would release his third solo album, This Delicate Thing We've Made (2007). In mid-2010, Hayes announced the completion of recording his fourth solo album, Secret Codes and Battleships, featuring three songs co-written and produced by Brian West and mixed by Robert Orton, who is best known for working with Lady Gaga. On 17 April 2011, Hayes signed with Mercury Records' Australian division and in August 2011 with EMI Records in the UK. The album was released in Australia on 21 October 2011, 24 October in the UK and 25 October in the US, with singles \"Talk Talk Talk\", \"Bloodstained Heart\", and \"Black Out the Sun\" released before the album. In 2013, Hayes relocated from London to Los Angeles, where he began to pursue a career in improv sketch comedy and acting. In 2015, he created a comedy podcast titled The He Said He Said Show, on which he stated in an episode that he has retired from the music industry."@en ;

After performing in a number of heavy metal bands in high school, Townsend was discovered by a record label in 1993 and was asked to perform lead vocals on Steve Vai's album Sex & Religion. After recording and touring with Vai, Townsend was discouraged by what he found in the music industry, and vented his anger on the solo album Heavy as a Really Heavy Thing released under the pseudonym Strapping Young Lad. He soon assembled a band under the name, and released the critically acclaimed City in 1997. Since then, he has released three more studio albums with Strapping Young Lad, along with solo material released under his own independent record label, HevyDevy Records. Townsend's solo albums, a diverse mix of hard rock, progressive metal, ambient, and new-age, have featured a varying lineup of supporting musicians. In 2002 he formed the Devin Townsend Band, a dedicated lineup which recorded and toured for two of his solo releases. In 2007, he disbanded both Strapping Young Lad and the Devin Townsend Band, taking a break from touring to spend more time with his family. After a two-year hiatus, he began recording again, and soon announced the formation of the Devin Townsend Project. The project began with a series of four albums, released from 2009 to 2011, each written in a different style, and Townsend continues to record and tour under the new moniker. Across all his bands and projects, Townsend has released twenty-three studio albums and three live albums. Townsend's trademark production style, featuring a heavily multitracked wall of sound, has been compared to the styles of Phil Spector and Frank Zappa. His versatile vocal delivery ranges from screaming to an opera-esque singing, and his songwriting is similarly diverse. Townsend's musical style is rooted in metal, and his albums are written to express different aspects of his personality."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Dexter Gordon (February 27, 1923 \u2013 April 25, 1990) was an American jazz tenor saxophonist. He was among the earliest tenor players to adapt the bebop musical language of people such as Charlie Parker, Dizzy Gillespie, and Bud Powell to the instrument. Gordon's height was 6 feet 6 inches (198 cm), so he was also known as \"Long Tall Dexter\" and \"Sophisticated Giant\". His studio and live performance career spanned over 40 years. Gordon's sound was commonly characterized as being \"large\" and spacious and he had a tendency to play behind the beat. He was famous for humorously inserting musical quotes into his solos. One of his major influences was Lester Young. Gordon, in turn, was an early influence on John Coltrane and Sonny Rollins. Rollins and Coltrane then influenced Gordon's playing as he explored hard bop and modal playing during the 1960s. Gordon was known for his genial and humorous stage presence. He was an advocate of playing to communicate with the audience. One of his idiosyncratic rituals was to recite lyrics from each ballad before playing it. A photograph by Herman Leonard of Gordon taking a smoke break at the Royal Roost in 1948 is one of the iconic images in jazz photography. Cigarettes were a recurring theme on covers of Gordon's albums. Gordon was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role for his performance in the Bertrand Tavernier film Round Midnight (Warner Bros, 1986), and he won a Grammy for Best Jazz Instrumental Performance, Soloist, for the soundtrack album The Other Side of Round Midnight (Blue Note Records, 1986)."@en ;

He pioneered the surf music style, drawing on Eastern musical scales and experimenting with reverberation. He worked closely with Fender to produce custom made amplifiers, including the first-ever 100-watt guitar amplifier. He pushed the limits of electric amplification technology, helping to develop new equipment that was capable of producing distorted, \"thick, clearly defined tones\" at \"previously undreamed-of volumes.\" The \"breakneck speed of his single-note staccato picking technique\" and showmanship with the guitar is considered a precursor to heavy metal music, influencing guitarists such as Jimi Hendrix and Eddie Van Halen."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"LaDonna Adrian Gaines (December 31, 1948 \u2013 May 17, 2012), known by her stage name Donna Summer, was an American singer, songwriter, and painter. She gained prominence during the disco era of the late-1970s. A five-time Grammy Award winner, she was the first artist to have three consecutive double albums reach No. 1 on the United States Billboard 200 chart and charted four number-one singles in the U.S. within a 12-month period. Summer has reportedly sold over 140 million records, making her one of the world's best-selling artists of all time. She also charted two number-one singles on the R&B charts in the U.S. and one number-one in the U.K. Summer earned a total of 32 hit singles on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 chart in her lifetime, with 14 of those reaching the top ten. She claimed a top 40 hit every year between 1975 and 1984, and from her first top ten hit in 1976, to the end of 1982, she had 12 top ten hits;(10 were top five hits) more than any other act. She returned to the Hot 100's top five in 1983, and claimed her final top ten hit in 1989 with \"This Time I Know It's for Real\". Her most recent Hot 100 hit came in 1999 with \"I Will Go With You (Con Te Partiro)\". While her fortunes on the Hot 100 waned through those decades, Summer remained a force on the U.S. Dance/Club Play Songs chart over her entire career. While influenced by the counterculture of the 1960s, she became the front singer of a psychedelic rock band named Crow and moved to New York City. Joining a touring version of the musical Hair, she left New York and spent several years living, acting, and singing in Europe, where she met music producers Giorgio Moroder and Pete Bellotte. Summer returned to the U.S., in 1975 after the commercial success of the song \"Love to Love You Baby\", which was followed by a string of other hits, such as \"I Feel Love\", \"Last Dance\", \"MacArthur Park\", \"Heaven Knows\", \"Hot Stuff\", \"Bad Girls\", \"Dim All the Lights\", \"No More Tears (Enough Is Enough)\" (duet with Barbra Streisand), and \"On the Radio\". She became known as the \"Queen of Disco\", while her music gained a global following. Summer died on May 17, 2012, at her home in Naples, Florida. In her obituary in The Times, she was described as the \"undisputed queen of the Seventies disco boom\" who reached the status of \"one of the world's leading female singers.\" Giorgio Moroder described Summer's work with him on the song \"I Feel Love\" as \"really the start of electronic dance\" music. In 2013, Summer was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Donovan Philips Leitch (born 10 May 1946), known as Donovan, is a British singer, songwriter and guitarist. He developed an eclectic and distinctive style that blended folk, jazz, pop, psychedelia, and world music (notably calypso). He has lived in Scotland, Hertfordshire (England), London and California, and, since at least 2008, in County Cork, Ireland, with his family. Emerging from the British folk scene, Donovan reached fame in the United Kingdom in early 1965 with live performances on the pop TV series, Ready Steady Go!. Having signed with Pye Records in 1965, he recorded singles and two albums in the folk vein, after which he signed to CBS/Epic Records in the US - the first signing by the company's new vice-president Clive Davis - and became more successful internationally. He began a long and successful collaboration with leading British independent record producer Mickie Most, scoring multiple hit singles and albums in the UK, US, and other countries. His most successful singles were the early UK hits \"Catch the Wind\", \"Colours\" and \"Universal Soldier\" in 1965. In September 1966 \"Sunshine Superman\" topped America's Billboard Hot 100 chart for one week and went to number two in Britain, followed by \"Mellow Yellow\" at US No.2 in December 1966, then 1968's \"Hurdy Gurdy Man\" in the Top 5 in both countries, then \"Atlantis\", which reached US No.7 in May 1969. He became a friend of pop musicians including Joan Baez, Brian Jones and The Beatles. He taught John Lennon a finger-picking guitar style in 1968 that Lennon employed in \"Dear Prudence,\" \"Julia,\" \"Happiness Is a Warm Gun\" and other songs. Donovan's commercial fortunes waned after parting with Most in 1969, and he left the industry for a time. Donovan continued to perform and record sporadically in the 1970s and 1980s. His musical style and hippie image were scorned by critics, especially after punk rock. His performing and recording became sporadic until a revival in the 1990s with the emergence of Britain's rave scene. He recorded the 1996 album Sutras with producer Rick Rubin and in 2004 made a new album, Beat Cafe. Donovan was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2012 and the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 2014."@en ;

Hansen created the Demento persona in 1970 while working at Los Angeles station KPPC-FM. After Hansen played \"Transfusion\" by Nervous Norvus on the radio, DJ \"The Obscene\" Steven Clean said that Hansen had to be \"demented\" to play that. Thereafter, the name stuck. His weekly show went into syndication in 1974 and from 1978 to 1992 was syndicated by the Westwood One Radio Network. Broadcast syndication of the show ended on June 6, 2010, but the show continues to be produced weekly in an online version. Hansen has a degree in ethnomusicology, and has written magazine articles and liner notes on recording artists outside of the novelty genre. He is credited with introducing new generations of listeners to artists of the early and middle 20th century whom they might not have otherwise discovered, such as Haywire Mac, Spike Jones, Benny Bell, Yogi Yorgesson, Stan Freberg, and Tom Lehrer, as well as with bringing parodist \"Weird Al\" Yankovic to national attention."@en ;

The Allman Brothers Band was formed in Jacksonville, Florida, in 1969. The band had great success in the early 1970s. Allman is best remembered for his brief but influential tenure in the band and in particular for his expressive slide guitar playing and inventive improvisational skills. In 2003, he was ranked number 2 in Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 100 greatest guitarists of all time, second only to Jimi Hendrix. In 2011, he was ranked number 9. His guitar tone (achieved with a Gibson Les Paul and two 50-watt bass Marshall amplifiers) was named one of the greatest of all time by Guitar Player. A sought-after session musician both before and during his tenure with the band, Duane Allman performed with such established stars as King Curtis, Aretha Franklin, Wilson Pickett, and Herbie Mann. He also contributed greatly to the 1970 album Layla and Other Assorted Love Songs, by Derek and the Dominos. Duane Allman's skills as a guitarist were complemented by personal qualities such as his intensity, drive and ability to draw the best out of others in making music. He is still referred to by his nickname \"Skydog\"."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Elaine Paige OBE (born Elaine Jill Bickerstaff, 5 March 1948) is an English singer and actress best known for her work in musical theatre. Raised in Barnet, Hertfordshire, Paige attended the Aida Foster Theatre School, making her first professional appearance on stage in 1964, at the age of 16. Her appearance in the 1968 production of Hair marked her West End debut. Following a number of roles over the next decade, Paige was selected to play Eva Per\u00F3n in the first production of Evita in 1978, which brought her to the attention of the broader public. For this role, she won the Laurence Olivier Award for Performance of the Year in a musical. She went on to originate the role of Grizabella in Cats and had a Top 10 hit with \"Memory\", a song from the show. In 1985, Paige released \"I Know Him So Well\" with Barbara Dickson from the musical Chess, which remains the biggest-selling record by a female duo. She then appeared in the original stage production of Chess, followed by a starring role in Anything Goes which she also co-produced. Paige made her Broadway debut in Sunset Boulevard in 1996, playing the lead role of Norma Desmond, to critical acclaim. She appeared in The King and I from 2000 to 2001, and six years later she returned to the West End stage in The Drowsy Chaperone. She has also worked sporadically in television. In addition to being nominated for five Laurence Olivier Awards, Paige has won many other awards for her theatre roles and has been called the First Lady of British Musical Theatre due to her skill and longevity. She has released 22 solo albums, of which eight were consecutively certified gold and another four multi-platinum. Paige is also featured on seven cast albums and has sung in concerts across the world. Since 2004 she has hosted her own show on BBC Radio 2 called Elaine Paige on Sunday. In 2014, Paige celebrated her 50 years in show business. Paige announced on her official website a \"Farewell\" concert tour and a new career-spanning album 'The Ultimate Collection' to mark this milestone in her career."@en ;

The name Esthero refers both to the singer and formerly to the two-person team of herself and producer Doc McKinney. Esthero is a portmanteau of \"Esther the hero\". She claims to have gotten the name by combining the name of the heroine (Esther) and last line (\"If I am to be the hero, then I cannot fly from darkness.\") of the movie from Sylvia Plath's novel, The Bell Jar. Esthero's sound characteristically features her voice over a mix of mellow bass lines, jazzy trumpets, Spanish guitar and hip-hop. She is sometimes compared to artists Bj\u00F6rk, Portishead and Sade. Later female artists who count Esthero among their influences include Res, Fergie and fellow Canadian Nelly Furtado.

She is the female vocalist for the hip hop group The Black Eyed Peas, with whom she has achieved chart success worldwide. Her debut solo album The Dutchess (2006) was a major commercial success on the charts and spawned three Billboard Hot 100 number one singles; \"London Bridge\", \"Glamorous\" and \"Big Girls Don't Cry\". Ferguson was a member of the children's television series Kids Incorporated and the girl group Wild Orchid. In 2001, she left the group and in the subsequent year began to team up with The Black Eyed Peas. With The Black Eyed Peas, she enjoyed a series of hits and albums before she released her solo debut album in September 2006 to success. The Black Eyed Peas enjoyed further success with the release of their third album with Ferguson, The E.N.D. (2009); they attained their first string of Billboard Hot 100 number one songs. She began touring in 2009/2010 with her group and she launched her debut fragrance, Outspoken, under Avon in May 2010 and has since released three more fragrances. She continued success with The Black Eyed Peas and they released the album The Beginning (2010), which featured three singles, including two number one songs. As Ferguson's five solo singles and six singles with The Black Eyed Peas have reached two million downloads in the United States, Ferguson was the artist with the most two-million sellers by the beginning of 2011."@en ;

He also created a comic outspoken hayseed character, Simon Crum; and recorded under the stage name Terry Preston from 1948-53. In 2010, Husky was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Not to be confused with Frank Farina. Frank Farian (born Franz Reuther 18 July 1941, Kirn, Germany) is a German record producer and songwriter, best known as the founder and voice behind the 1970s disco-pop group Boney M. and as the mastermind and voice behind the lip-synching group Milli Vanilli. His tendency to create bands with a visual image distinct from the recorded musical performances has led to controversy throughout his career, especially in the case of Milli Vanilli. During his career, Frank Farian has sold more than 850 million records worldwide (according to the German magazine Der Spiegel). Farian is also the owner of the record label MCI and several subsidiaries. Farian started as a trained cook before moving into the music industry. In the early days of his career, he was keen to attain success as a solo artist, but he made little impact on the popular music scene until his song \"Baby Do You Wanna Bump\" (a remake of Prince Buster's song \"Al Capone\" from 1967), released under the pseudonym Boney M., became successful. He also had a minor hit in 1973 with \"Was kann sch\u00F6ner sein\", a German version of \"When You've Gotta Go\" originally by Solomon King, co-written by Lynsey de Paul and Ron Roker. Shying away from the spotlight, he hired performers to front for public performances. The lead vocals for songs on Boney M. albums in the 1970s were sung by Farian, Marcia Barrett and Liz Mitchell, who quickly became synonymous with the group. Boney M.'s frontman, Bobby Farrell, was only allowed to record vocals in the 1980s (although all four members of the group did sing live for all their concert tours). Bobby Farrell was fired from the group for unreliability in 1981. Farian also started the supergroup Far Corporation (named after the first syllable of his last name), which featured Steve Lukather, David Paich, Bobby Kimball, Simon Phillips, and Robin McAuley, many of Toto fame. Far Corporation is notable for being the first act to chart with a cover version of Led Zeppelin's \"Stairway to Heaven\", becoming a top 10 hit in the UK, reaching number 8 in October 1985. In 1986, Farian produced and mixed the Meat Loaf album Blind Before I Stop. He also sang backing vocals on the first single from the album \"Rock 'n' Roll Mercenaries\", which was credited to Meat Loaf featuring John Parr. Some other groups that Farian has been involved with are Eruption (he became a manager in 1977) and No Mercy."@en ;

Autry was also one of the most important figures in the history of country music, considered the second major influential artist of the genre's development after Jimmie Rodgers. His singing cowboy movies were the first vehicle to carry country music to a national audience. In addition to his signature song, \"Back in the Saddle Again\", Autry is still remembered for his Christmas holiday songs, \"Here Comes Santa Claus\", which he wrote, \"Frosty the Snowman\", and his biggest hit, \"Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer\". Autry is a member of both the Country Music Hall of Fame and Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame, and is the only person to be awarded stars in all five categories on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, for film, television, music, radio, and live performance.
