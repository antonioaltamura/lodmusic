Many are pop songs that can be stretched to fit the motif, for example Madonna's \"Like a Virgin\" is used in reference to the Virgin Mary (although the song itself has nothing to do with the mother of Jesus), Beyonc\u00E9 Knowles' \"Naughty Girl\" in reference to Santa Claus and his list of children who are naughty or nice and Vanilla Ice's \"Ice Ice Baby\" repeats the word \"ice\" which fits in with the winter season."@en ;

The title, which is an abbreviation for The Awesome Power of a Fully Operational Mothership, refers to the P-Funk Mothership that was first introduced in 1975 on Parliament's Mothership Connection album. The album was presented as a reunion album because it featured collaborations with former Parliament-Funkadelic members including Bernie Worrell, Bootsy Collins, Junie Morrison, Maceo Parker, and Fred Wesley \u2014 some of whom hadn't worked with Clinton in many years. The album also included contributions by current members of the P-Funk All-Stars. Following the release of T.A.P.O.A.F.O.M., Clinton launched the \"Mothership Reconnection Tour\" with Bootsy Collins, Bernie Worrell, and the P-Funk All-Stars. The Mothership Reconnection Tour, which began in New York's Central Park, included the landing of a full-scale Mothership on stage, from which Clinton emerged. The artwork for T.A.P.O.A.F.O.M. was unique among P-Funk albums in that it included contributions by all three artists associated with the band: Pedro Bell, \"Stozo the Clown\" Edwards, and Overton Loyd. The Japanese version of \"T.A.P.O.A.F.O.M.\" contains an extra track entitled \"Secret Love\", co-written by Clinton's son Tracey Lewis aka Trey Lewd.

The first disc featured the original quartet in recordings from 1977 and 1979, and the second disc the expanded ten-piece lineup that toured in 1980 and 1981. The album contains live versions of songs that appear on Talking Heads: 77, More Songs About Buildings and Food, Fear of Music, and Remain in Light. The cassette edition of the album included \"Cities\" as a bonus track not included on the vinyl edition \u2013 this track has been included on the subsequent CD release. The title of the album is a reference both to the group's preference for having no expressed definite article within the band name (as opposed to \"The Talking Heads\") and to David Byrne's minimalist introductions to songs. The album opens with one such introduction: \"The name of this song is New Feeling. That's what it's about.\" An expanded version of the record, on CD in the United States for the first time, was released in 2004 by Sire/Warner Bros./Rhino. It duplicated the pattern of the original with the first disc featuring the quartet alone, and the second disc a ten-member band. Additional tracks from 1978 are among the eight extra songs on the first disc, and correct running order for the set from the larger band on the second disc. The introduction to the song \"Crosseyed And Painless\" was edited out on the CD version, however. The remastered & expanded edition of the album currently sits at number fifteen on the Metacritic list of all time best-reviewed albums."@en ;

For this release, a second drum track (apparently by Bernard Purdie[citation needed]) was overdubbed on \"Ain't She Sweet\" as apparently, Atlantic officials were not impressed by the drumming of Pete Best.

	dbo:abstract	"Bad English is the self-titled platinum-selling debut album by American rock supergroup Bad English, released in 1989. The band scored two huge hits on the Billboard charts including the No. 1 hit \"When I See You Smile\" and No. 5 hit \"Price of Love\". In all, five singles were officially released from the album, all charting on the Hot 100. First single \"Forget Me Not\" was a major hit at rock radio, spending two weeks at No. 2 on the Mainstream Rock Tracks chart, but it narrowly failed to hit the pop Top 40. The second single was the Diane Warren-penned power ballad \"When I See You Smile\", which was a massive multiformat hit, spending two weeks at No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100, two weeks in the top 10 at rock radio, and getting significant and sustained play at Adult Contemporary radio. But \"When I See You Smile\" lingered in the pop Top 40 and was still climbing the Adult Contemporary charts, and close to being certified Gold, long after the song had peaked at rock radio. When the decision was made to release a second consecutive power ballad as the album's third single (\"Price of Love\"), the band released the stomper \"Best of What I Got\" as a promo to U.S. rock radio, hoping to maintain interest and credibility with the rock audience for their live headlining tour. The plan worked, as \"Price of Love\" hit the pop top five but did not receive enough rock radio airplay to hit the 40-place Rock Tracks chart, while \"Best of What I Got\" surged to No. 9 there (the band's second-highest showing on that chart), and the band was invited to join the Whitesnake tour beginning in the spring for a second jaunt around the U.S. A five-video collection was released, containing the music videos for \"Best of What I Got\", \"Heaven Is a 4 Letter Word\", \"Forget Me Not\", \"When I See You Smile\", and \"Price of Love\"."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"From Langley Park to Memphis is the third album by English pop band Prefab Sprout, and was released in March 1988. The title is taken from a lyric to the song, \"The Venus of the Soup Kitchen\", and refers to the village of Langley Park, County Durham in England, and the city of Memphis, Tennessee in the United States. \"Nightingales\" features the harmonica playing of Stevie Wonder, while Pete Townshend plays acoustic guitar on \"Hey Manhattan!\". All songs on the album are written by frontman Paddy McAloon, who also produced many of the tracks. The album reached number five in the UK Albums Chart, the highest position for any studio generated album recorded by the band. However, their greatest hits compilation album, The Best of - A Life of Surprises, peaked at number 3 in August 1992. Five singles were released to promote the album; in order of release these were \"Cars & Girls\", \"The King of Rock 'N' Roll\", \"Hey Manhattan!\", \"Nightingales\" and \"The Golden Calf\". A sixth track, \"I Remember That\", was subsequently released as a single to promote A Life of Surprises."@en ;

D.I.T.C. members Showbiz and Lord Finesse each contribute one number and as the album was released the production was highly praised for its clean, crispy but at the same time dark and menacing sound. O.C. plays with a wide array of styles on the album, from the war-metaphor battle song \"War Games\" to abstract stories on the haunting \"The Crow\" and a very special history on a mystique woman that enters Credles life in \"Stronjay\". Though the differences between O.C.'s two first efforts are very noticeable many fans are constantly, and still, arguing which was the better album out of them. This album, like his first, received strong reviews, but lacked in sales. He made his first appearance on the Billboard 200 album chart with the album, and also made his first appearance on the Billboard Hot 100 singles chart, with the single \"Far From Yours\".

The album was released during a troubling and downward time for the lead singer, Martha Reeves, who was now heavily addicted to painkillers. Often, the singer went into nervous breakdowns that led to a rare stint at an institution. Like many Motown albums of the late sixties, the album was produced by several in-house producers including Ashford and Simpson, Frank Wilson and Deke Richards.

dbr:Wishbone_Four	rdf:type	schema:MusicAlbum ;
	dbo:abstract	"Wishbone Four is the fourth studio album by British rock band Wishbone Ash, released in 1973. It was a departure from their previous album, Argus, in that it lacked that recording's overall cohesion and atmosphere and the loose conceptual framework of a stately, pastoral and warring medieval England. Containing only hints of the extended twin-lead guitar harmonies, Wishbone Four's stylistic variety found its footing in acoustic folk elements in half of the eight-song set (\"Ballad of the Beacon\", \"Everybody Needs a Friend\", \"Sorrel\" and \"Sing Out the Song\"), two aggressive and melodic starters on each side of the vinyl release (Side 1: So Many Things to Say\" and Side 2: \"Doctor\"), and the band's first use of horns on the semi-autobiographical \"rave-up\" touring song \"No Easy Road\". Although the sombre, sensitive and rather more fragile acoustic songs contained the wistful intro elements that featured on the previous album, the lead guitars lacked the slow climb of the band's trademark duelling crescendos and energetic fretwork expected from the band at the time, tending to a more subtle and subdued interplay on the longer tracks. Wishbone Four was popular among fans upon its release as it implied musical growth and a willingness to experiment in the band's divergence of a successful formula (similar at the time to the effect of Led Zeppelin III's contrast to that band's previous efforts). Wishbone Four was also the first release not produced by Derek Lawrence but by the band themselves. There's the Rub, the band's next and fifth studio album' was the first album to feature guitarist-vocalist Laurie Wisefield, who would be a major part of the band's creative direction for the next 11 years, as founding member Ted Turner left the band after the subsequent Wishbone Four tour."@en ;

It is comprised entirely of remixes of songs taken from Zombie's debut studio album, Hellbilly Deluxe (1998). Zombie worked with a number of musicians and producers to create updated versions of the songs, including Charlie Clouser, who had previously worked with Zombie on his debut solo effort. Ten of the original albums songs have been remixed, excluding three instrumental interludes. Two of the remixes featured on American Made Music to Strip By had previously been released on promotional discs for \"Dragula\" (1998) and \"Living Dead Girl\" (1999). Upon its release, American Made Music to Strip By was met with a mixed critical reception. Though some tracks received praise for their updated sound, others were seen as simply redundant or predictable. The project received minimal promotion leading to its release, and debuted at number thirty-eight on the Billboard 200 chart in the United States. American Made Music to Strip By has went on to sell over 300,000 copies worldwide since its initial release. The album was followed by the promotional vinyl Spookshow Baby Remix-a-Go-Go, released on November 30, 1999.

All of the tracks, excluding \"Juno\", were included on the band's 2003 (see 2003 in music) EP, \"Seven Ways to Scream Your Name\". \"Red Is the New Black\" was rerecorded for the band's first album Casually Dressed & Deep in Conversation, whilst \"Juno\" was rerecorded in a new arrangement and titled \"Juneau\" for the album. The band recorded a promotional video for \"10:45 Amsterdam Conversations\" with the current line up in late 2002 for Bandit; a Welsh TV show. The EP was later re-released due to a high demand. The original CD is gold coloured whilst the re-release is pale blue; the liner sleeve on the re-release is a pale blue rather than white and the background colour on the back of the case is also pale blue rather than orange. A remastered edition was released on November 15, 2013. It included four remastered tracks from the original release, two early versions of later re-recorded songs (\"Grand Central Station\" became \"This Letter\"), The Getaway Plan (a song that was released as a B side to the Juneau single as well as on the Seven Ways to Scream Your Name EP) and four live-in-studio versions of the songs with the current FFAF lineup (Matt performs the screamed vocals himself)."@en ;

I went through a period where I was very much secluded, and my only distractions were my vivid dreams which became a form of escapism\".

Lamb, who had previously used the song's title phrase as an advertising slogan.

	dbo:abstract	"Human 2.0 is an album from Swedish grindcore band Nasum. The band came up with the title during 1999 as a reference to some of the panic over issues such as the Y2K bug. The band decided that they wanted the cover to be white in order to stand out from the many dark album covers that other bands used. Although the album Inhale/Exhale was never released in Japan, Relapse had made a deal with Ritual Records/Howling Bull for \"Human 2.0\". The band had already come up with the idea of updating the title for the Japanese release and make it \"Human 2.01\", with additional bonus tracks. The album contains a number of references to popular culture. \"Resistance\" uses a quote from the movie The Matrix: \"I hate this place. This zoo. This prison. This reality, whatever you want to call it, I can't stand it any longer.\" The song \"Sometimes Dead is Better\" uses the quote \"Welcome to the desert of the real\". In \"Parting Is Such Sweet Sorrow\", the beginning quote is from the movie The Shawshank Redemption."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"It Don't Get Any Better Than This is an album by American country music singer George Jones released on April 7, 1998 on the MCA Nashville label. Jones's 55th studio album would be his last with MCA Nashville Records. The album's title track was used as the theme song to Jones's talk show which aired on what was then The Nashville Network. The program featured informal chats with Jones holding court with country's biggest stars old and new and, of course, music. Guests included Loretta Lynn, Trace Adkins, Johnny Paycheck, Lorrie Morgan, Merle Haggard, Billy Ray Cyrus, Tim McGraw, Faith Hill, Charley Pride, Bobby Bare, Patty Loveless and Waylon Jennings, among others. Singles released from the album were \"Wild Irish Rose\" and \"No Future for Me in Our Past\", both of which failed to chart, a common occurrence for Jones in recent years since he was no longer played on mainstream country radio. The song \"It Doesn't Get Any Better Than This\" includes several guest vocalists, including Johnny Cash, Waylon Jennings, Willie Nelson, Bobby Bare, and Merle Haggard, while T. Graham Brown duets with Jones on the song \"Got To Get To Louisiana\". Many of the songs on the album have a chequered history. \"When Did You Stop Loving Me\" was originally recorded by George Strait on the soundtrack to the 1992 film Pure Country, and was a Top Ten single for him in 1993. \"Small Y'all\" was previously recorded by Randy Travis on his 1994 album This Is Me, and later re-recorded by Jones as a duet with Kenny Chesney on Chesney's 2010 album Hemingway's Whiskey. \"Smack Dab\" was later recorded by Ken Mellons on his 2004 album Sweet, and \"Don't Touch Me\" is a cover of the Jeannie Seely single. The album also features several songs written by Nashville veteran Bobby Braddock, who co-wrote \"He Stopped Loving Her Today\"."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Live & Rare is a compilation album of band Korn that was released on May 9, 2006, and features thirteen tracks - all seven from the DVD featuring 2003's CBGB show in New York, which are found on special editions of Greatest Hits Vol. 1, two from Woodstock 1999, three cover songs (one a hidden track from Follow the Leader and another a hidden track from Take a Look in the Mirror), and \"Proud\" taken from the I Know What You Did Last Summer soundtrack. This compilation was released after Korn left Epic Records, so it's likely the band had no contributions to the track listing. Also, there is no new material on this album, and most of the tracks are available on other releases, thus sales of the compilation were disappointing. As of May 31, 2006, it has sold nearly 52,000 total copies in the United States."@en ;

Their performance of John Lennon's \"God (The Dream Is Over)\" was not included on the album due to copyright issues. Keyboard player Spike Edney had to play a second solo (neither are on the CD, the first being on the video) after May had technical problems before playing \"Last Horizon\". Also, \"Back To The Light\", \"Tie Your Mother Down\", \"Love Token\", \"Headlong\", \"Let Your Heart Rule Your Head\", \"Resurrection\" (in particular, Cozy Powell's drum solo), \"We Will Rock You\" and \"Hammer to Fall\" are all slightly shortened on the CD, but appear in full on the 90-minute video of the same event. The spoken part after \"Love Token\" has been cut because it contained too many profanities, but it can be heard fully on the unofficial audience recording. The show includes live renditions of the top ten singles \"Driven By You\" and \"Too Much Love Will Kill You\"."@en ;

This expanded version of Spiritualized headlined Glastonbury in 1998, and was also filmed on Later... with Jools Holland. This orchestral line-up signalled the dense Let It Come Down, released 3 years later.The cover photograph is taken from 8,000 feet (2.4 km) above the Royal Albert Hall by Farrow Design. The majority of the setlist comes from Ladies And Gentlemen We Are Floating In Space, their third album, with some material from their previous albums, Lazer Guided Melodies and Pure Phase. \"Walking With Jesus\" was a Spacemen 3 song from The Perfect Prescription, but Pierce has performed it throughout his career.

	dbo:abstract	"Split the Country, Split the Street is Kevin Devine's third studio album. It was released in 2005, being the second of two albums released on Triple Crown Records. It is the first solo record released after Kevin was no longer in Miracle of 86 (a band in which he was the lead singer). The album features more rock oriented songs with fuller band arrangements than his previous two releases, and was produced by Chris Bracco, Mike Skinner & Kevin Devine. Kevin said of the album: \"Split the Country was done after the band [Miracle of 86] broke up, like the hangover from that. It was more bi-polar: aggressive rock songs with fuller instrumentation, but also songs with violins and glockenspiel or just a guy with a guitar.\" Despite the break, the album features former Miracle of 86 member Mike Robertson on guitar for three songs. Early versions of \"Haircut\" and \"Probably\" feature on the Travelling the EU EP. The German record label, Defiance Records, released a double LP set with both Split the Country, Split the Street and Kevin's previous album, Make the Clocks Move. In a 2011 interview with Triple Crown Records' founder Fred Feldman, when asked about a possible re-issue of Split the Country, Split the Street, he responded with \"We\u2019re going to do the other Kevin Devine record [Split the Country, Split the Street] as well\". The re-issue was released on November 20, 2012 on CD and LP with two bonus tracks, new artwork and new liner notes by Kevin and Matt Pinfield."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Swing to the Right is a Utopia (featuring Todd Rundgren, Roger Powell, Kasim Sulton, and Willie Wilcox) album from 1982. It followed the well-intentioned Beatles parody/homage Deface the Music. Swing to the Right swings into hard-edged commentary on corporate raiders, warmongers, political villains, and despicable music industry moguls. There is little in the way of progressive rock on this album, which is limited to its title track. Originally recorded in the Winter of 1981 and set for release that June, Bearsville Records was reluctant to release the album because of the album's overly political and religious tone. In protest Utopia took this material on the road for a full year begging audiences to petition Bearsville Records execs to release it, even going as far as giving out the phone number and address of Bearsville Records and instructing audiences to ask for Albert Grossman. The cover photo is a retouched and tinted reproduction of a well-known photograph taken at a public burning of Beatles records, which took place in 1966 in the American South in response to John Lennon's controversial \"We are more popular than Jesus now\" remark. It depicts a group of youths standing around a bonfire, while in the foreground a boy holds an LP which is about to be thrown into the fire. In the original image, the album the boy holds is the American version of The Beatles debut LP Meet The Beatles, but on the Utopia cover this has been photographically replaced with an image of the Swing To The Right cover (thereby creating the illusion of an endless regression of the same image)."@en ;

The album features a variety of producers: Cas, DJ Eli, dminor and DJ Rob A each produce one track, Dr. Butcher co-produces two with Metal Fingers and Count Bass D provides two solo productions and one co-production with Metal Fingers. The rest of the album's production, most of it, is handled by Metal Fingers. Vocal guest appearances are made by Count Bass D, MF DOOM and Grimm's Monsta Island Czars colleague Megalon. All the tracks on the album are original, except for \"Break 'Em Off,\" which appeared on the MF EP collaboration with MF DOOM. Grimm was sentenced to life imprisonment in 2000 for narcotics and conspiracy offences. Paying a one-day bail of $100,000, he recorded The Downfall of Ibliys: A Ghetto Opera in those twenty-four hours. Grimm also said in an interview that the album is mainly a lot of questions he had about his life and that his other albums are answers to life. Studying law while incarcerated, Grimm appealed his sentences and filed counter-suits, with the ultimate effect that his sentence was commuted to three years and he was released in 2003. The album is widely considered to be an underground classic alongside MF DOOM's Operation: Doomsday and Count Bass D's Dwight Spitz. The Downfall of Ibliys: A Ghetto Opera was, along with Digital Tears: E-mail from Purgatory, re-issued in 2010 after being out of print for many years."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Tiempo De Amar (1996) is Menudo's 36th album (23rd in Spanish). It features Abel Talam\u00E1ntez, Alexis Grull\u00F3n, Andy Bl\u00E1zquez, and new members Didier Hern\u00E1ndez from Cuba, and Anthony Galindo from Venezuela. Didier and Anthony replaced Ashley Ruiz and Ricky L\u00F3pez after they both decided to leave the group. This was the last album recorded under the Menudo name. Creator Edgardo D\u00EDaz had sold the name to a Panamanian company, so the group's name was changed to MDO. After this, Andy Bl\u00E1zquez left the group and was replaced by new member Daniel Ren\u00E9 Weider. With Daniel, the group recorded their first album under the group's new name. The album was self-titled MDO. Daniel left the group in 1998. Although management looked for a new member and, in fact, Ricky L\u00F3pez rejoined the group for a few months, they finally decided not to replace Daniel. Later that year, the band released their second album under the new name, featuring Abel, Alexis, Didier, and Anthony, titled Un Poco M\u00E1s. This was the only record the group released with only four members. In 2000, Anthony left the group. That same year management recruited two new members: Pablo Portillo from Mexico and Troy Tuminelli of Italian descent. With these two new boys, the group released their third album under their name MDO, titled Subir Al Cielo. In 2001, management decided to let Troy go because he was not fitting in with the others, he could not sing and was having problems learning the groups choreographies. New member Caleb Avil\u00E9s joined the band that same year and their first English album under the name MDO was released, titled A Little Piece Of Heaven. Caleb left the group in 2002 and so did long-time member Alexis Grull\u00F3n, leaving Abel, Didier, and Pablo as a trio. Anthony Galindo rejoined the group in 2002 to help the guys finish with presentations management had already booked and later that year, the guys decided to call it quits for good. In 2005 Menudo/MDO creator, Edgardo D\u00EDaz decided to revive MDO and held auditions. The new group consists of four members: Luis Montes, Elliot Suro, Daniel Rodr\u00EDguez, all from Puerto Rico, and Lorenzo Duarte from Venezuela. Their first album is titled Otra Vez released that same year. An acoustic version was also released titled Onda Ac\u00FAstica. Edgardo D\u00EDaz also put together another group with younger kids using the same formula he used with Menudo. The group's name is Tick Tock."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"World Party is the third studio album by the Atlanta-based, hip hop quartet Goodie Mob. It follows their previous Dirty South classics, Soul Food and Still Standing. This is the last Goodie Mob album with the original four members before their breakup (though all four members have recently joined back together in 2010 to record a new album). Goodie Mob made two other albums after this one with a shortened roster, One Monkey Don't Stop No Show without Cee-Lo and Livin' Life As Lumberjacks without Cee-Lo or Big Gipp. World Party was released in 1999 under LaFace Records as a more commercial alternative to their usual socially conscious lyricism. What was maybe an attempt to appeal more to the masses was met with mixed reviews from their old fans and made little impact on the ones they were trying to reach. Goodie Mob was dropped from their label as a result of this album's lackluster sales. The song Rebuilding is one of Kanye West's first produced tracks to be released on a nationwide album. The Album was Certified Gold By the RIAA in 2000 Former NFL cornerback Asante Samuel has a tattoo on his left arm that says \u201CGet Rich To This,\u201D because he liked that song in college."@en ;

Dana Kletter (ex-Blackgirls, Dear Enemy, and Hole's Live Through This) contributed backing vocals to \"Chips Ahoy!\", \"You Can Make Him Like You\", and \"First Night\". The album title is a line taken from the opening lines of the song \"Stuck Between Stations\" (\"There are nights when I think that Sal Paradise was right/Boys and girls in America have such a sad time together\"), which in turn refers to a quote from American novelist and poet Jack Kerouac's 1957 novel On the Road and its narrator, Sal Paradise.

The album was produced by 4AD co-founder Ivo Watts-Russell and recorded at Palladium Studios in Edinburgh. The remixes included on the album (\"A Day\" and \"Stranger\") were mixed and produced by John Fryer at Blackwing Studios in London. Fryer had gained notability for working with seminal bands on the 4AD, Mute, Rough Trade and Beggars Banquet record labels, including Depeche Mode, Fad Gadget and Cocteau Twins. The album drew comparisons to Joy Division and The Cure and created a buzz in clubs.Reviewers in subsequent years have derided the album as dated and derivative, but accurately reflecting the emerging goth sound of the time, with \"icy, throbbing keyboards; bummed-out vocals; chilly, robotic percussion; gloomy, ethereal guitars; and unusual, cryptic song titles\". In 1985, Melody Maker pronounced the debut \"a nervous and brilliant record\" from \"guitar-splayed firefields of 'Cry in the Wind' and 'Stumble and Fall', and thrill(!) to the system clearing, bass bloodied '7th Time'... The range and depth of this mysterious record do not exclude arrogant electro dance anthems like 'Stranger' and 'A Day'; nor do Xymox avoid sentimentality as on 'No Human Can Drown'\". In the same year, Sounds deemed the album \"a strange and wonderful debut from 4AD's first signing since Dead Can Dance. Particular favourite is 'A Day' which suggests so many places, colours feelings and despairs that it is totally awe inspiring\"."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Forget Yourself is the fifteenth album by the Australian psychedelic rock band The Church, released in October 2003. It was recorded at drummer Tim Powles' Spacejunk studios in Australia and features many straight-to-tape recordings with few overdubs. Around the time of Parallel Universe's (late 2002) release, the Church returned to the studio to record another album, eventually entitled Forget Yourself. Rather than fleshing the songs out over a long, gradual process, the band decided to keep the music as close to the original jam-based material as possible. Stylistically, this made for a much rawer sound, primarily recorded live and with minimal overdubs. As had become routine since Sometime Anywhere (May 1994), songs saw numerous instrument changes between members, with Powles playing guitar on \"Sealine\" and Willson-Piper switching to drums on \"Maya.\" John D. Luersson at AllMusic described the album as \"a timeless, magical disc that is easily as strong as anything from their 1980s peak\", adding that \"the real brilliance peeks through on lush numbers like 'Telepath,' 'Maya,' and 'June,' all boasting the ethereal moments that made early discs like Remote Luxury and Heyday fan favorites.\" The album peaked in the top 50 on Billboard component chart, Top Independent Albums."@en ;

The release of Friendly People gained Guttermouth supporting slots on national and world tours with bands such as The Offspring. During these tours the band developed a reputation for chaos and outrageous behavior, resulting in their being banned and blacklisted from several tours and venues. The most famous of these incidents included the band being banned for several years from performing in Canada on charges of public indecency due to onstage nudity in Saskatoon, and singer Mark Adkins' arrest for \"assault with a deadly weapon\" after using his onstage microphone to incite a near-riot during a show in San Bernardino. Some early versions of the CD copy of the album contain technical errors. The songs are tracked out of order from their original listing, and the overall speed is slower making the recording sound like a slower mix. These inconsistencies are due to technical errors at the plant where the CDs were produced."@en ;

The CD was recently included as the first in a series of influential Christian albums in Blaze magazine's Blast from the past section, saying that modern Christian artists owe a lot to the path this album created, because it \"...showed music from a Godly perspective could sound extremely catchy, have lyrics that were honest and still glorify God\".

When Gasolin' released G\u00F8r det Noget in November 1977 (translation: \"does it matter\" or \"so what\"), they knew it was their last album. After the ambitious Gas 5 and Efter endnu en dag, Gasolin' decided to make a garage-rock album. Therefore, the service of Roy Thomas Baker was not needed and G\u00F8r det Noget was produced by Gasolin' and \"Rocco\" Tommy Bogs. The sound on G\u00F8r det Noget is raw and thunderous and songs such as \"Jumbo Number Nul\" and \"Kina Rock\" sounds like Sex Pistols. Sentimental ballads like \"Kattemor\" and \"L\u00E6nges Hjem\" has a rawness due to the minimalist production, but all the songs are still very catchy. Especially \"Det bedste til mig og mine venner\" and \"Strengelegen\". From this album \"Jumbo Nummer Nul\" / \"Kattemor\" and \"Kina Rock\" / \"L\u00E6nges Hjem\" were released as singles. G\u00F8r det Noget was recorded in Sweet Silence Studio in Copenhagen and engineered by Freddy Hansson and Flemming Rasmussen.

	dbo:abstract	"Hologram of Baal is the eleventh album by the Australian psychedelic rock band The Church, released in September 1998. It was written and recorded following the full-time return of founding guitarist Peter Koppes, who had left the band in 1992 after the Priest=Aura tour. It was also the first album which the band had produced on their own and was recorded and mixed by their drummer Tim Powles. Album titles originally proposed by singer Steve Kilbey included Bastard Universe and Hologram of Allah, but these were rejected as too inflammatory. In the end, the latter was amended with the name of a deity from the Canaanite pantheon and the former was used as the title of the bonus disc. The song \"This Is It\" is about the death of INXS front man and fellow Australian, Michael Hutchence. The bonus disc, Bastard Universe, included with the first pressings, contained a seemingly continuous 79 minute instrumental improvisation, divided into six \"stages\". The U.S. and U.K. pressings list only four \"stages\", although all six tracks are present on the CDs. The original Australian cover design, featuring a green, full-frame, pseudo-holographic image of a primitive mask, was heavily modified for the U.S. and U.K. releases. These feature a plain reddish-brown image of the mask, originally used inside the Australian booklet, placed to the right (U.S.) or left (U.K.) of a vertical black bar containing the band's name in large dark blue type. During the subsequent U.S. tour in 1999, Kilbey was arrested in New York City for attempting to purchase heroin. He was sentenced to community service by sweeping subway cars. The band performed the following night at New York's Bowery Ballroom with Marty Willson-Piper serving as lead vocalist.

The names are Pete Rock, Freddie Foxxx, Kenny Parker (brother of KRS), DJ S&S, Kenny Dope, Kid Capri and Domingo. The song \"Ah Yeah\" originally appeared on the compilation album Pump Ya Fist.

The first three released included songs by Aya Hirano as Haruhi Suzumiya, Minori Chihara as Yuki Nagato and Yuko Goto as Mikuru Asahina. Moreover, two additional character CDs were released on December 6, 2006, sung by Yuki Matsuoka as Tsuruya and Natsuko Kuwatani as Ry\u014Dko Asakura. Two more character CDs were released on January 24, 2007, sung by Sayaka Aoki as Kyon's Sister and Yuri Shiratori as Emiri Kimidori. Finally, the CDs for Itsuki Koizumi and Kyon were released on February 21, 2007. Each of the nine singles feature the ending theme song \"Hare Hare Yukai\". Other than the three main female character's versions which are solo cover versions of the original, there are some alterations. For Tsuruya's version as well as Ry\u014Dko's version, the lyrics were changed to fit the character; Tsuruya's version contains her catch phrase \"nyoro\", while Ry\u014Dko reverses the optimistic lyrics to convey futility and destruction. However, while Tsuruya's and Ry\u014Dko's versions have the same arrangements as the original version, the last four released have their arrangements changed along with the lyrics. Kyon's Sister's version is very upbeat; Emiri's version is very fact-based; Itsuki's version talks about his ESP; and Kyon reflects about his now-disturbed life in his version."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Music in a Doll's House is the debut album by progressive rock group Family, released on 19 July 1968. The album, co-produced by Dave Mason of Traffic, features a number of complex musical arrangements contributing to its ambitious psychedelic sound. The Beatles had originally intended to use the title A Doll's House for the album they were recording during 1968. The release of Family's similarly titled debut then prompted them to adopt the minimalist title The Beatles for what is now more commonly referred to as The White Album due to its plain white sleeve. \"Old Songs, New Songs\" features a cameo from the Tubby Hayes group. The album was the first of its kind by an English rock group on the US Reprise label set up for Frank Sinatra. It was licensed to the label by Dukeslodge Enterprises, a company run by the band's manager, John Gilbert, who also acted as 'executive producer' of the album. The album was released on vinyl in two different guises: mono (RLP6312) and stereo (RSLP6312) and Stereo 8 Track Cartridge. Mono vinyl copies featured a different mix to the stereo pressing and many mono copies were returned to the shops as they often skipped tracks. The mono edition was swiftly withdrawn, making this a much sought-after format. This album was initially issued in the US using the UK import and sold in the US as a domestic album with an extra piece of cardboard to stiffen up the sleeve (as they essentially had the same catlog number in both countries). Around the time the second album was issued in the US, US pressings of this album started to appear. (The album also initially had a 12\" black and white photo of group included as an insert.) In the Q & Mojo Classic Special Edition Pink Floyd & The Story of Prog Rock, the album ranked number 30 in its list of \"40 Cosmic Rock Albums\"."@en ;

dbr:Never_Home	rdf:type	schema:MusicAlbum ;
	dbo:abstract	"Never Home is the fourth album by singer-songwriter Freedy Johnston. It was released in 1997 on Elektra Records. Johnston credited producer Danny Kortchmar with imparting a more spontaneous, live-sounding feel to this album than its predecessor, This Perfect World. The leadoff track, \"On the Way Out,\" is a wry song about shoplifting. It's a re-recorded version of a song that appeared on the soundtrack to the movie Things to Do in Denver When You're Dead. (He had originally written it for the movie Empire Records, but it was not accepted.) It and \"One More Thing to Break\" are the only two songs on the album that have much of a rock edge. \"Western Sky\" is about a man afraid to fly because of the death of his father in a crash. Johnston doesn't typically use events in the lives of friends as inspiration for his songs, but this is an exception. He was a little uncomfortable with the notion of having \"exploited\" a friend, although he noted that the friend had no problem with the song. Another highlight, \"Gone to See the Fire,\" concerns a woman gradually working out a very disturbing secret about her boyfriend. \"If It's True\" wrestles with unplanned pregnancy. \"Something's Out There,\" a fairly light song about UFO abduction, is a rare collaboration for Johnston. He wrote it with Stan Lynch, the album's drummer, who is best known for his work with Tom Petty. Cellist Jane Scarpantoni, a frequent Johnston collaborator, appears on two tracks."@en ;

In spite of this, the band claims that this was a very passionate recording session, and was the beginning of a new era. Some songs were re-recorded for the album Frenzy, but the band considered the original recordings to be far superior. This was partly due to the engineering and mixing incompetence on that album by producer Mallory Earl resulting in tracks described by Noel Crombie as \"woolly and average\", and also from subdued performances by the band. In 2007, Split Enz keyboardist Eddie Rayner remixed the available tapes; a limited edition 2 CD set was made available by the Frenz Of The Enz fan club to its members, while the commercial release is a single CD."@en ;

The EP consists of songs released by the Beatles, that sold over 1 million copies each, the highest being She Loves You, which sold 1.89 million copies.[citation needed] All four tracks had previously been #1 hit singles in the UK chart and apart from Can't Buy Me Love had not appeared on any previous studio album so the EP effectively served both as a catch-up for new listeners as well as being the nearest thing to a greatest album the group's homeland had seen up to this point.

It collects together most of the material Bowie recorded for Deram Records that has been previously released in some form, including the 1967 debut album in its entirety (tracks 5-18), in chronological order. Tracks 24-27 were mixed/recorded in 1969 after Bowie was dropped from Deram Records and were for the promotional video \"Love You Till Tuesday\", made to sell Bowie to a new label. Thus Deram originally had nothing to do with these tracks. Originally this was planned to a be a two-disc release featuring several previously unreleased tracks, but Bowie vetoed the inclusion of such material. Reportedly the tracks Bowie vetoed included songs called \"Pussy Cat\", \"Back To Where You've Never Been\", \"Funny Smile\", \"Bunny Thing\", a cover of The Velvet Underground's \"Waiting for the Man\" and German-language versions of \"Love You 'Till Tuesday\" and \"When I Live My Dream\" (the last three have been widely bootlegged). A reel to reel copy taken directly from the master tapes exists of the songs \"Funny Smile\", \"Bunny Thing\", and \"Pussy Cat\" and is owned by a previous employee of Decca Records who worked for the company at the time the tracks were recorded. This person has stated that the tracks (which apparently do nothing to enhance Bowie's reputation) will not be made public."@en ;

Regarding the lengthy and unusual name of the album, guitarist Trevor de Brauw joked, \"The title is meant to confuse people. The original title was going to be Black Doom on Tuesday.\" According to de Brauw, various influences came into making the album, including early industrial, hardcore, other metal influences, and has also noted the high quality of the studio and exceptional amount of time the group had to finish the album compared to that of their previous effort, Australasia. As the band is very environmentally conscious, The Fire... has a nature-driven theme with song titles such as \"Last Day of Winter,\" \"Autumn into Summer,\" and \"Aurora Borealis.\" It also marks the introduction of acoustic guitar to Pelican's catalog of full-length albums. \"March to the Sea\" found substantial airplay on the satellite radio station Hard Attack. An extended version of the track, entitled \"March into the Sea,\" was released on the group's similarly titled EP only a few months prior. This version has a less refined sound and runs nearly twice as long at 20:28. De Brauw considers the EP version a \"teaser single before the record came out, as well as a collector's item for completionists.\""@en ;

The album is seen as the 'blueprint', or first step towards success for the grime genre, and many artists have cited Treddin' on Thin Ice to be the pinnacle of grime, before Wiley began taking a slightly different direction with later works, such as the album See Clear Now (2008) - in particular the UK number 2 single \"Wearing My Rolex\", which takes a more dance-style approach."@en ;

Other non-album b-sides were also included, such as \"Half Caste\", \"Just the Two of Us\" and \"Don't Play Around\".

	dbo:abstract	"White Bread Black Beer is the fifth studio album by British post-punk/pop band Scritti Politti, released in the UK on 28 May 2006 by Rough Trade Records, and in the US on 25 July 2006 by Nonesuch Records. It is effectively a solo album by the group's only permanent member, Green Gartside, as it was written and recorded at his home in Dalston in east London and he sang and played all the instruments on the album. The album was Green's first for Rough Trade since leaving them in somewhat acrimonious circumstances in 1983, following the release of Scritti Politti's debut album Songs to Remember. Since then Scritti Politti had been signed to Virgin Records and the previous three albums have been known for their highly-produced sound. White Bread Black Beer, however, marks a return to a more minimalist style. The album was nominated for the 2006 Mercury Music Prize and has been critically regarded as one of 2006's finest, leading Gartside to perform his first worldwide gigs in almost 25 years."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Your Only Friend is the second studio album by Ehron VonAllen. Released on Hydrology Records on July 4, 2005, it was the firsttime VonAllen had produced his album independently. There were no specific singles pushed from the album. It was marketed as a whole work and not broken up into different songs. In fact, no remixes have ever been released from the album making it the only Ehron VonAllen cd to do so. This album is widely considered to be a fan favorite, however while being successful, it hasn't sold as many units as his debut album \"Incarnation\" and \"The Sin Of Nature\". The album originally was intended to be called \"Attrition\" which actually had artwork for the CD already drawn up with this title on it and with an entirely different cover. The song \"Attrition\" later was included on VonAllen's fourth studio album The Sin Of Nature. The first track \"Shattered\" was originally to be a short introduction with only one verse of lyrics. On the song \"Love Is Strange\" the main string theme that is heard looped throughout the song is actually a sample of three notes from Recoil's song \"Strange Hours\" from the album \"Liquid\".Additionally while VonAllen usually writes his own lyrics, the ending of this song contains a few words from John Lennon's song \"Oh My Love\".1 of 2 drum patterns heard at the outro of the song is a sample of the main drum pattern from Depeche Mode's \"World In My Eyes\".This song was more of a tribute to several of his favorite artists than anything else. \"My Desire\" is sung by R&B vocalist Morgan Hinton. \"Trial Of Jealousy\" was the first song written for \"Your Only Friend\". \"The Statue Of Night\" is a sequel to the song \"The Statue Of Light\""@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Diana Ross & the Supremes: Greatest Hits (also released as The Supremes: Greatest Hits) is a two-LP collection of singles and b-sides recorded by The Supremes, released by Motown in August 1967 (see 1967 in music). The collection was the first LP to credit the group under the new billing Diana Ross & the Supremes. Although founding member Florence Ballard is pictured on all album artwork and sings on all the tracks, by the time the set was released, she had been fired from the group and replaced by Cindy Birdsong. It would rank as their second #1 album holding a distinction that it would take decades for another female group to achieve. The 2-LP set topped the Billboard Album Chart for 5 consecutive weeks, spending 20 weeks in the top 5 and 24 weeks total in the top 10. It remained on the Billboard Album Chart for 89 weeks. According to Motown data the album eventually sold over 6,200,000 copies."@en ;

The photo on the album cover was taken after Wilson's death, but his picture can be seen in a frame on the wall behind John Lee Hooker. Guitarist Henry Vestine was also missing from the photo session. The person standing in front of the window, filling in for Henry, is the band's manager, Skip Taylor.[citation needed] Careful examination of the photo reveals that Henry's face was later added by the art department. It was the first of Hooker's albums to chart, reaching number 78 in the Billboard charts."@en ;

The clown illustrations on its front and back covers were later combined and recolored for The Hole Truth...'s front cover.

This performance marked the first time that new member Cindy Birdsong had performed overseas with original Supremes Diana Ross and Mary Wilson, a year after original founding member Florence Ballard was ousted. The group performed a variation of standards, show tunes, and their own classics with British rock stars Mick Jagger and Paul McCartney reportedly in attendance. The songs recorded are from the group's 1968 European tour. That European tour also garnered a famous Swedish television special that was used as a catalyst to promote this album. The album includes \"Medley: The Leading Ladies\", a solo spot for Diana Ross. It is a variation of a medley she first performed on her second starring role on their television special, \"G.I.T. (Gettin' It Together)\" that also featured The Temptations. The contemporary hits go up to the first two Top Ten singles from the \"Reflections\" album. Songs omitted from the recording are \"I Hear a Symphony\", \"Unchained Melody\", \"Somewhere\" and \"Queen of the House\"."@en ;

ns61:_Motion_Picture_Score	rdf:type	schema:MusicAlbum ;
	dbo:abstract	"Mortal Kombat: Motion Picture Score is the instrumental score album released to accompany the Mortal Kombat film. The music was composed by George S. Clinton with additional guitar work provided by Buckethead and drums by Brain. The album contains two unused tracks in the film named \"Farewell\" and \"Kids\" with the latter been heard off at the end of Mortal Kombat: Annihilation. Clinton based his main themes on traditional taiko drums, emphasizing the film's mystical atmosphere and Asian-influenced style. It is also notable that he used Shakuhachi flute, didgeridoos and a Tuvan throat singer to give a more exotic musical landscape unlike other similar scores of the early 90's. In an interview with the Hollywood Reporter celebrating the 20th anniversary of the film, Clinton mentioned that \"For the first test screening they had put a temporary score under it that was mainly traditional orchestral action music, and it became clear that the target audience, which was used to hearing techno music blasting during game play, was not happy with that approach. So that gave me the opportunity to come up with an approach I called \u201CTechno-Taiko-Orcho.\u201D My score would have a techno core with a layer of Asian ethnic instruments (Taiko drums, shakuhachi, Tuvan throat singer) surrounded by an orchestra. But not just a regular orchestra, a Testosterone Orchestra. No treble clef instruments (no flutes, clarinets, trumpets, violins, etc.). Just 18 violas, 14 celli, six basses and lots of low brass \u2014 and percussion. It was massive. When music supervisors John Houlihan and Sharon Boyle introduced me to guitar wizard Buckethead, I knew he would become a major element in my score as well\". Clinton also created the sound effect that suggests the presence of Shang Tsung in the film echoing the usage of multiple didgeridoos in a hall, a popular musical choice along with segments of this score that are used extensively in other film teasers and trailers, most notable in Roland Emmerich's Godzilla and the Final Destination franchise."@en ;

Although the compilation was released in 1985, it does not include material released after 1977. The first two compilations had already covered material released exclusively up to 1977 and Original Masters rehashes much of their material.

Produced by Rick Rubin whose concept was to record an unadvertised performance in a small club with a small crowd, many of whom would not necessarily be fans of Clay's act. Clay chose a New York club owned by comedian Rodney Dangerfield, Dangerfield's, to record during the holiday season. A sequel, The Day the Laughter Died, Part II was released in 1993. The album is largely improvisational, with Clay interacting with the audience over the course of over an hour and a half. The topics run through his usual gamut of sex, relationships between men and women, masculinity, religion and popular culture. Unlike his prior recordings, the jokes are delivered intentionally flat and raw as to offend and alienate the audience, turning the performance into the joke itself. Clay's performance results in several members of the audience leaving the show early, some insulting him as they leave."@en ;

Directed and produced by Beth McCarthy-Miller, the concert was held and filmed on July 27, 2003 at Hutchinson Field in the south-side of Grant Park in Chicago, Illinois; over 50,000 people attended. The concert itself differed from that of the Up! Tour (2003\u201304), featuring a different stage, setlist and production. Behind-the-scenes footage of the singer visiting local landmarks and events was filmed the same week. The concert film premiered on the National Broadcasting Company (NBC) on August 19, 2003. The special was watched by over 8.87 million viewers, becoming the second-most-viewed concert film on television, behind Celine Dion's A New Day... Live in Las Vegas (2003). Due to its high television ratings, Up! Live in Chicago was released as a video album on November 18, 2003 by Mercury Records Nashville. Released both in standard DVD packaging and in a jewel case, it featured additional performances not included on the television presentation. The album was also received positively by music critics, who complimented Shania's interaction with the audience; however, some questioned her live singing. The video peaked at number two on Billboard's Top Music Video sales chart, and was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for shipments of 100,000 copies in the United States. It was also certified platinum in Australia and gold in Austria and Brazil. Excerpts from Up!

	dbo:abstract	"Visions of Eden is the eleventh album by American heavy metal band Virgin Steele, released on September 8, 2006 via Sanctuary Records. The album is subtitled The Lilith Project - A Barbaric Romantic Movie of the Mind. It is a concept album based on Gnostic beliefs, which critically revisits the traditional Christian mythology about the creation of the Earth and the Biblical accounts of Adam and Eve. The story revolves around Lilith, the first wife of Adam and a symbol of female strength and independence. Representing the female side of the true, higher god, she suffers under the lusting, jealous Demiurge who represents the Christian god, and as an emancipated woman who could not get along with the dominant Adam stands in stark contrast to Eve. Adam's second wife is portrayed as a docile, subservient partner created by the demiurge at the request of Adam, who could not cope with an independent woman on equal footing with him. Regarding Visions of Eden, David DeFeis declared: \"What it really is, is the soundtrack for a major motion picture that has yet to be made! And by the hammer of Zeus, I will make this film one day. I call this work a Barbaric Romantic movie of the mind.\". The concept was, also, adapted for theater's actors live performances (as previously done by DeFeis for The House of Atreus Act I and The House of Atreus Act II) and performed on stage in Germany theaters by Landestheater Production."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Workin' Overtime is the seventeenth studio album by American singer Diana Ross, released on June 6, 1989 by Motown. It was Ross' first Motown album since Diana (1980), after Ross left the label for a then record breaking $20 million deal with RCA. Upon Diana's return to the label, Motown founder Berry Gordy, Jr. had sold the label to MCA Records and had positioned Jheryl Busby to the head of Motown. Ross was at first reluctant to return to her old label but Gordy promised her a lot in her return: not only would Ross return to Motown as a recording act, but she would be the label's part-owner. Ross reunited with collaborator Nile Rodgers to make this album - which was an attempt to gear her to a much younger audience bringing in new jack swing productions and house music. Upon its release, Workin' Overtime received negative reviews from music critics and failed despite the title track reaching number three at R&B radio. The album peaked at number 116 on the Billboard 200 album chart, earning the distinction of being the lowest charting studio album of Ross' entire solo career. Its final sales were slightly higher than 100,000 copies in the United States. Additional singles \"This House\" and \"Bottom Line\" were issued, as well as a remix of \"Paradise\" remixed by Shep Pettibone, but all failed to revive the disc. In the United Kingdom the album charted at number 23 and was certified silver for sales in excess of 60,000 copies."@en ;

Grimm recorded the entire album over a two day period, and wrote the album and composed the drum beats on a portable drum machine while serving his life sentence in prison. This album is the darkest in Grimm's catalog and reflects the environment surrounding him during the composition. It was the first release after Grimm's release from prison. Most of the production work was handled by Looie II and Zero Point, with two tracks produced by J-Zone. Although the album includes samples from the film Godzilla vs. Megalon and one production from X-Ray, there are no other references to the Monsta Island Czars (other than Grimm's references to himself as \"Jet Jaguar\").

dbr:Magician_Among_the_Spirits	rdf:type	schema:MusicAlbum ;
	dbo:abstract	"Magician Among the Spirits is the tenth album by the Australian psychedelic rock band The Church, released in August 1996. The album title was inspired by a book written by Harry Houdini and C. M. Eddy, Jr. (uncredited) in 1924, in which the famed magician discussed his investigations of spirit mediums. A photographic negative of Houdini is incorporated as the centrepiece of the album artwork. The album was reissued with a revised track listing as Magician Among the Spirits Plus Some in 1999. Without a recording deal after Sometime Anywhere, the band's future looked bleak as Kilbey and Willson-Piper began work on new recordings in 1995. Although initially a two-man project, the new material saw input from new drummer Tim Powles and hired violinist Linda Neil. Renewed contact between Kilbey and Peter Koppes led to the latter agreeing to guest on four songs, despite having left the band in 1992. Simon Polinski (Yothu Yindi) was drafted in to co-produce, engineer and mix the sessions. The music saw a return to guitar-based material, infused with krautrock and art rock influences. A 15-minute atmospheric piece called \"Magician Among the Spirits\" dominated the sessions, featuring Koppes on guitar and split Kilbey/Willson-Piper vocals (as on \"Two Places at Once\"). Contributions from Utungun Percussion added a new, primal aspect to several songs. The album was released on the band's own Deep Karma label but due to financial constraints they had to arrange outside distribution for markets in North America and Europe. This limitation almost doomed the album from the beginning, but worse events were to come. Within a short time, the U.S. distributor went bankrupt, leaving the band stripped of its earnings from North American sales. Although exact figures remain unknown due to disputes, up to A$250,000 worth of merchandise (some 25,000 discs) was lost. For a band already on shaky foundations, this was nearly the death knell. Comments by Kilbey in May of that year summed up the situation: \"There's no immediate future for The Church.....Our management, the whole thing is broken down.....We don't really have a label. We're owed lots and lots of money and we're broke. We're trying to pursue lawyers to get our money back. Marty and I aren't having any communication. There's no one really managing us so.....that could have been the last record.\""@en ;

It received both lackluster commercial and critical reception and is considered to be a patchy diversion, according to Dean Carlson of Allmusic ."@en ;

The album was commercially unsuccessful, due in part to Kristofferson's declining career as a singer and the release of The Highwaymen's second album, Highwayman 2, the week before. Kristofferson expressed support for Nelson Mandela and the Sandinista National Liberation Front; not long prior to the album's release, Mandela was freed from prison and the Sandinistas were defeated in elections, transferring power to the National Opposition Union. \"Third World Warrior\" was originally released on both LP and CD, and was reissued on CD by OhBoy Records (via Universal Music Special Markets) in 2004, along with Kristofferson's other Mercury album, \"Repossessed\".

It was released in Canada on October 17, 2006, in two formats: as a limited edition Digipak and regular jewel case. The United States release was March 6, 2007, in advance of a planned tour. This album was recorded at various locations including Maui, Vancouver and Toronto. In concert Gord Downie joked that the title of the album is actually a typo, and should read \"World Contain Her.\" The first single, \"In View\", and the video for the song, were released on the band's website in advance of the album release. \"In View\" reached #1 on the Canadian singles chart. The track \"The Lonely End of the Rink\" was premiered on Hockey Night in Canada on October 7. The album's fourth track, \"Fly\", has been in the works since before the band recorded their November 26, 2004 show at the Air Canada Centre, which became the concert DVD, That Night in Toronto. As can be witnessed on the DVD, Gord Downie recites the opening lyric of \"Fly\", as well as a portion of the chorus, as a part of his rant during the extended up-tempo break of \"At the Hundredth Meridian\". The length of the CD is erroneously noted as \"42:45\" (min:sec) on the front and back cover. It is actually 42:27 (min:sec), or 42.45 minutes in length (42 min + (27/60) sec).

Demolition Plot J-7 shared many of the same indie and punk rock influences of Pavement's 1989 debut Slay Tracks (1933-1969), but also diversified the group's sound by incorporating keyboards. Many of the songs on Demolition J-7 were written while Scott Kannberg and Jason Fawkes were in their short-lived band, Pa. After Stephen Malkmus heard demos recorded by Pa, the songs turned into a Pavement project. The recording session for Demolition J-7 was more difficult than for Slay Tracks due to tension between producer Gary Young and Fawkes.

The album was co-written by Dobson with producers Jay Levine and James Bryan McCollum. The album consists mainly of pop rock and punk music, and deals mainly with the topics of love and heartbreak. Several songs on the album are done acoustically while the remaining tracks feature prominent guitar and drum beats. The album was released to generally positive reviews from critics; however, its commercial performance was mixed. The album debuted at number one on the US Billboard Heatseekers Albums Chart. It debuted at number 111 on the Billboard 200 chart, eventually peaking at 67. Despite the minor success of the single \"Everything\" in the UK, the album failed to chart there, or anywhere outside of the US and Canada. The album did, however, spawn several successful singles. The first of these, titled \"Bye Bye Boyfriend\" was released during the final quarter of 2003 to generally positive critical and commercial performance. However, the single was only released in Canada. The second single, \"Take Me Away\", was her first single to be released internationally. The single became her second hit in Canada, as well as her only single to date that has charted on the US Billboard Hot 100 singles chart. In 2004, Dobson released a new single, \"Don't Go (Girls and Boys)\", which was then appended to later pressings of the album. The song was also featured in a Tommy Hilfiger commercial starring Dobson. In March 2004, the album was certified Platinum by the Canadian Recording Industry Association for sales of 100,000 copies. It has also sold over 300,000 copies in the US, giving it sales a roundabout 500,000 copies worldwide."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Resident Alien is the first album by the British glam rock band Spacehog. Released by Sire Records and Elektra Records on 24 October 1995, the album was certified gold on 29 July 1996 and included the hit single \"In the Meantime\", which reached the top of the Mainstream Rock Tracks chart in the US, and remained there for four weeks. Most of Resident Alien's basic tracks were recorded live in a barn in Woodstock, New York. It was intended to give the album the immediacy of live room recording. Although Jonny Cragg makes his singing debut in \"Skylark\" on the band's sophomore LP, The Chinese Album, it is his voice that introduces \"Space Is the Place\" on Resident Alien. The spoken line in the middle of \"Never Coming Down (Part II)\", \"Everybody in the world is bent\", comes from the 1969 movie The Italian Job. The movie also features jail inmates clapping out the rhythm used in this song. In a tribute to the film Candyman, the chorus to \"Candyman\" repeats the titular name four times (also referencing the Sammy Davis Jr. standard). \"Only a Few\" and \"In the Meantime\" were used in the 1996 movie Libor Karas World Tour, The Bouncing Czech. \"In the Meantime\" was also used as the theme song for David Spade's 1998 one-hour HBO stand-up comedy special David Spade: Take the Hit, was used in the film Fanboys and is a playable song in the video game Guitar Hero 5 as a re-recording, as the original recording featured in Rock Band 3 in addition serving as the theme song for the TV show Hindsight. \"Never Coming Down (Part II)\" was featured in the 1996 movie D3: The Mighty Ducks."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Your Funeral\u2026 My Trial is the fourth studio album by Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds, released on 3 November 1986 by Mute Records. Your Funeral... My Trial was originally released as a double EP. The album was issued on CD with a different running order and the bonus track \"Scum\". During this period in his life, Cave was steeped in heroin addiction, perhaps evidenced by the melancholy, desperate mood of this album. Cave later said, \"That particular record, which is my favourite of the records we've done, is very special to me and a lot of amazing things happened, musically, in the studio. There are some songs on that record that as far as I'm concerned are just about perfect as we can get really- songs like \"The Carny\", \"Your Funeral, My Trial\", and \"Stranger Than Kindness\", I think are really quite brilliant.\" Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds appeared in the 1987 Wim Wenders film Der Himmel \u00FCber Berlin, performing \"The Carny\" (which is heard once before the performance scene) and \"From Her to Eternity\". \"The Carny\" also inspired the 2003 animated short film Jo Jo in the Stars, which won the BAFTA Award for Best Animated Short Film. The film was created and directed by Marc Craste, who said about \"The Carny\": \"The lyrics read like a short story, it seemed to suggest a film \u2013 a straight visual interpretation of the text...\" The album was remastered and reissued on 27 April 2009 as a collector's edition CD/DVD set.

As the name suggests, Discography is a collection of all of the hit singles by Pet Shop Boys up to that point (1991). It is an 18-track compilation, sixteen of which are singles released to that date, while the last two (\"DJ Culture\" and \"Was It Worth It?\" are new songs recorded exclusively for this album. The album contains the Pet Shop Boys cover version of U2's hit \"Where the Streets Have No Name\", which later in the song breaks into the chorus of Frankie Valli's \"Can't Take My Eyes Off You\". Although the album's songs were released in some other form, this compilation only features seven-inch versions. Around the time of the release of Discography, Pet Shop Boys also released a video collection, Videography, consisting of the music videos for each of the songs on this album in a slightly different order and with the song \"Was It Worth It?\" being replaced with \"How Can You Expect to Be Taken Seriously?\", which itself was not on the audio versions of the album, despite being part of a double A-side with \"Where the streets have no name (I Can't Take My Eyes Off You)\" (the exclusion due to the constrictions of the CD's running time). In 2003, Pet Shop Boys released an updated single collection called PopArt, which featured the video version of \"Suburbia\", and the album mix of \"Heart\" by mistake, but excluded \"Was It Worth It?\". In addition, it featured all the Pet Shop Boys singles released after 1991 with the exception of \"Absolutely Fabulous\" (which the duo do not consider a Pet Shop Boys release as the artist was credited as \"Absolutely Fabulous\") and \"How Can You Expect to Be Taken Seriously?\".

dbr:Return_of_Saturn	rdf:type	schema:MusicAlbum ;
	dbo:abstract	"Return of Saturn is the fourth studio album by the American rock band No Doubt, released on April 11, 2000 by Interscope Records. It marked the band's first album as a quartet, following the departure of original keyboardist Eric Stefani in 1994. After touring for two and a half years to promote their breakthrough third studio album, Tragic Kingdom, No Doubt wrote several dozen songs for its follow-up and eventually settled on working with producer Glen Ballard. Creating the album became a tumultuous process lasting two years, during which there was dissension among band members and between the band and its label. The album was completed after the band returned to the studio and recorded what became two of the album's singles. The album maintains the ska punk and reggae influences of the band's previous work, but with slower, more ballad-like songs. The lyrics to many of the songs describe singer Gwen Stefani's pining for a more domestic life, contrasting that with her commitment to a music career. Upon release, Return of Saturn received favorable reviews from music critics, although several of them were divided over its different sound to its predecessor. It debuted at number two on the Billboard 200 but was unable to measure up to the sales of Tragic Kingdom. The album produced four singles, only one of which charted on the Billboard Hot 100. At the 43rd Grammy Awards, Return of Saturn was nominated for Best Rock Album."@en ;

It was recorded at London's Olympic Studio during the Let It Bleed sessions of 1969 and released on Rolling Stones Records in 1972. The album is a series of loose jams performed by band members while waiting for Keith Richards to return to the studio, Richards having earlier left the studio after an issue about Cooder's role as support guitarist. On the strength of the album's association with the Rolling Stones, Jamming with Edward! reached #33 on the US charts, although it failed to make the UK listings. The eponymous \"Edward\" was pianist Nicky Hopkins, in reference to Edward the Mad Shirt Grinder, Hopkins' star turn on Quicksilver Messenger Service's album Shady Grove. Hopkins also contributed the cover art. The liner notes were written by Mark Paytress and Mick Jagger. Jamming with Edward! was remastered and reissued by Virgin Records in 1994."@en ;

John Lennon and his wife Yoko Ono received a phone call from the festival's promoters John Brower and Kenny Walker, and then quickly assembled a band in a very short space of time to play at the festival, which was due to start the following day. The group had brief rehearsals before appearing on the stage to perform several songs; one of which, \"Cold Turkey\", was first performed live at said festival. Eventually returning home, Lennon mixed the album in a day. The album peaked at number 10 on the Billboard 200 and has been certified a gold album by the RIAA, and failed to chart in the UK.

The album mixed samples of Benedictine monks of the Abbey of Saint-Maur and Le Myst\u00E8re Des Voix Bulgares, with an 18-piece orchestra, guitars and electronics. Jon Crosby originally signed onto Elektra Records when he was only 17, and recorded his demo EP, VAST Is... which featured certain songs to be featured on their debut in an unfinished form. He also traveled across the world and recorded demos of world choirs that he used in various songs on the album, which gave the album its trademark world-music theme. The first single released from the album was \"Pretty When You Cry\". Led by a supporting music video, it gained modest success on the music charts. However, the band's and the album's popularity didn't skyrocket until the second single, \"Touched\", was featured in a film soundtrack and the music video was put in play on MTV. No other singles were released for the disc, and \"Touched\" is still VAST's most famous song, it being featured in the Angel soundtrack, Angel: Live Fast, Die Never the companion CD to the Everworld book series, and as a song featured in WrestleMania XXV. The track also appears in the movie The Beach but is not featured in the soundtrack. Other album tracks featured in various media include \"Flames\", which was used in the German film Summer Storm, and \"Here\", which has been used in two episodes of Angel. The songs \"Here\", \"Dirty Hole\", \"I'm Dying\", and \"Temptation\" were also used in the unaired pitch video for Angel. \"Touched\" contains elements of the song \"Pilentze Pee\", sung by the Bulgarian State Television Female Vocal Choir. \"Touched\" was featured in the surfing film Step into Liquid."@en ;

Three singles were issued: \"Rock and Roll Music\", \"It's O.K.\", and \"Everyone's in Love with You\". The first two charted on the Billboard Hot 100 at number 8 and number 29, respectively. With Blondie Chaplin and Ricky Fataar having left the Beach Boys since their previous album Holland (1973), 15 Big Ones was recorded at a time when the group were struggling with their creative direction. Responding to the unexpected success of the greatest hits compilation Endless Summer (1974), Brian Wilson, who was not credited as producer for any of the band's albums since Pet Sounds (1966), was brought into commandeering the 15 Big Ones sessions. Although the band implored his return, they resisted his desire for an underproduced sound. Upon its release, brothers Carl and Dennis Wilson voiced disappointment with the album, calling it \"unfinished\" and \"a bruising process\"."@en ;

The storyline of Civilization Phaze III involves a group of people living inside a piano, and the menacing reality of the outside world. The album's themes include personal isolation and nationalism. Much of the album's improvised dialogue was originally recorded as part of sessions which produced We're Only in It for the Money and Uncle Meat, which contained some dialogue by the same speakers, and some of the dialogue on this album previously appeared on the re-edited version of Lumpy Gravy released in 1968. New dialogue was recorded by Zappa in 1991, and includes similarly improvised dialogue by members of the Ensemble Modern orchestra, Zappa's daughter Moon Unit and actor Michael Rapaport. Civilization Phaze III has been acclaimed as one of Zappa's best works, and has been appraised for its challenging, complex music, largely composed and performed on a Synclavier.

dbr:Hatebreeder	rdf:type	schema:MusicAlbum ;
	dbo:abstract	"Hatebreeder is the second studio album by Finnish metal band Children of Bodom. In it, the band explores a classically influenced sound. It also carries some influence from neo-classical power metal, in the fast riffs and complex soloing style. This record contains concert favorites such as \u201CSilent Night, Bodom Night\u201D and \u201CDownfall\u201D. The keyboards show more presence on this album, with longer and more elaborate solos than in their previous work. The \u201CDeluxe Edition\u201D was released in 2005 with bonus material. Hatebreeder was also re-released in 2008. The band's self-titled song was re-recorded as the second-to-last track for this album. This was the first album with guitars in D tuning (D, G, C, F, A, D) after Something Wild, which was in C\u266F tuning (C\u266F, F\u266F, B, E, G\u266F, C\u266F)."@en ;
