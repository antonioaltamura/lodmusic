dbr:Cat_Daddy	rdf:type	dbo:MusicalWork ;
	dbo:abstract	"\"Cat Daddy\" is a 2011 song by American Hip hop group The Rej3ctz. It is based on a dance of the same name and is from the 2010 mixtape TheFUNKtion vs theKICKback. \"Cat Daddy\" was a MTV Jams \"Jam Of The Week\" in January 2011. It was released for digital download on February 16, 2011 on iTunes and subsequently charted on several Billboard charts, including the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart, where it spent fourteen weeks and eventually peaked at number 77, after being re-released on June 27, 2011. Chris Brown performed the Cat Daddy dance during the 106 & Park 10th Anniversary special in October 2010. Brown was the featured dance performer on the song's official video, which as of November 12, 2015 has over 99 million YouTube views. A Cat Daddy 2.0 video by Mario Van Peebles preceded the re-release of the song and was associated with the movie We the Party. Several notable celebrities have been filmed doing the dance, including Justin Bieber and Selena Gomez. The dance is described as a combination of buckling a seatbelt and rolling a wheelchair. The song and dance became a viral video in May 2012 when then-current Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue cover model Kate Upton posted a video of her bikini-clad rendition of the dance on YouTube, causing YouTube to temporarily ban the video. The propriety of the YouTube ban was hotly debated with articles in many top-tier publications including the Los Angeles Times, The Washington Post and the Daily News as well as leading news services such as ABC News and Fox News. Her video has about 25.7 million YouTube views, as of November 12, 2015."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Torner\u00F2 ([torne\u02C8r\u0254], I Will Return) was the Romanian entry in the Eurovision Song Contest 2006, performed in English and Italian by Mihai Tr\u0103istariu and composed by Mihai Traistariu and Eduard C\u00EErcot\u0103. Torner\u00F2 was ranked first in the Romanian national selection on 26 February 2006, receiving 22 points in total. The song is an up-tempo number, with Tr\u0103istariu addressing a former lover. He tells him that he is \"keeping your smile on my mind every day\" and that he knows he will return to him. The chorus (performed in Italian) in fact features him singing both that \"she\" will return to \"him\" and that \"he\" will return to \"her\". Prior to the Contest, a line was added in which Tr\u0103istariu sings in a falsetto voice after the phrase \"I just really miss you and I wanna kiss you\". In Eurovision 2006 Torner\u00F2 had received 172 points, the highest score from Romanian history in Eurovision, placing 4th in a field of 24 . Following the Contest, \" Torner\u00F2 \" became a world hit in Greece, Cyprus, Malta, Sweden, Norway, Finland, Denmark, Ireland, Spain, Portugal, Lithuania, Latvia, Macedonia, Croatia, Serbia, Rep. Moldova, Bulgaria, Ukraine, Poland, Belgium, Turkey, Netherlands. New versions were recorded by Mihai himself, as well as the popular Greek pop artists Tamta and Anna Vissi."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"Wolf at the Door\" is a song performed and composed by English alternative rock band Keane and was the second single they released, originally intended only as a promo item with only fifty copies made, becoming the rarest Keane item in existence.[citation needed] Recording started on 28 October 2000 and finished in May 2001 even though the record was originally planned to be released before 2001. The CD single was released by the band's own record label, Zoomorphic, in June 2001 and was sold at the pubs where Keane used to play. All fifty copies were handmade and recorded on CD-Rs. Because of its limited production it is one of the most desired collectors' items amongst Keane fans, and has been known to sell for around \u00A31000 on eBay. Its status as a rarity is such that, allegedly, no member of the band is in possession of a copy. The single features a re-recording of their previous single \"Call Me What You Like\", as well as an early version of \"She Has No Time\", which later would appear on Hopes and Fears, the band's debut album. Shortly after this record was released, guitarist Dominic Scott left the band, and was Keane's last release with a guitar as part of their instrumentation until the 2007 cover b-side \"She Sells Sanctuary\"."@en ;

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Irish_Blood,_English_Heart>	rdf:type	dbo:MusicalWork ;
	dbo:abstract	"\"Irish Blood, English Heart\" is a song written by British singer Morrissey from his 2004 album You Are the Quarry. It was released on 4 May 2004 in the United States and 10 May 2004 internationally. The song had been performed live numerous times prior to release, but Morrissey was without a record deal for some time. It was Morrissey's first single in seven years, and considered a major comeback. The music was written by Alain Whyte and had already been used on a song called \"Not Bitter But Bored\" for a band he was a part of called Johnny Panic and the Bible of Dreams. Morrissey wrote a whole new set of lyrics for this tune as well as changing the melody. He also did this with another Johnny Panic tune, \"Paranoia\", which was rewritten as \"Don't Make Fun of Daddy's Voice\". In the United Kingdom, the song was first played by Steve Lamacq on BBC Radio 1 on March 29, 2004. However, Radio 1 did not playlist the single. Only XFM, which playlisted it, provided much exposure for the single in the UK. Despite the lack of exposure on mainstream stations, \"Irish Blood, English Heart\" debuted at number 3 on the UK charts, making it Morrissey's highest charting single with or without The Smiths. The song draws on Morrissey's joint English and Irish heritage, and explores the themes of contention between the two nations. It is one of Morrissey's more political songs, with him denouncing Oliver Cromwell, the Tory Party and the Labour Party. The single's world premiere occurred on the KROQ-FM Kevin and Bean show on 22 March 2004. The song received consistent airplay throughout April and May on such alternative rock stations as WFNX (Boston), WWCD (Columbus), CIMX (Windsor), KMBY (Monterey / Salinas), XTRA (San Diego), and of course KROQ-FM (Los Angeles), as well as CFNY (Toronto). The single's airplay increased over the next few months and upon its release it spent two weeks at number 4 on Billboard's Hot 100 Singles Sales chart. It also reached number 36 on the Modern Rock Tracks chart, Morrissey's first single to chart there since 1994. An edited version eventually became one of the songs on the EA Sports videogame FIFA Football 2005's soundtrack. The game's version does not include the line \"And spit upon the name Oliver Cromwell/And denounce this royal line that still salutes him. And will salute him, forever\"; instead, after the verse \"I've been dreaming of a time when/The English are sick to death of Labour and Tories\", the song reverts to the line that begins \"To be standing by the flag not feeling shameful/Racist or partial\". The song has also been released as downloadable content for the console versions of the main games in the Rock Band series."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Moon & the Sky is a song by synthpop duo Erasure. Originally intended as the second single[citation needed] from their ninth studio album Loveboat, the album cut was remixed drastically for radio play by Jason Creasey and packaged with enough additional tracks and mixes that it could be considered an EP. Mute Records released the single in the UK under the title Moon & the Sky Plus, a similar tactic used for one of Erasure's previous singles (\"Rain\"). The song was written by Vince Clarke and Andy Bell and is an uptempo, electronic dance track. In its album version the song has a harsher, more techno-influenced feel. Maverick Records, Erasure's U.S. record label at the time, requested the single remixes[citation needed] but ended up passing on the Loveboat album altogether and releasing Erasure from their contract, leaving Mute records to release the U.S. version of Loveboat in 2003. The extended track count and running time of Moon & the Sky Plus made it ineligible for the UK singles chart at the time. A 12 inch single, presented as a double A-side with a remix of Loveboat track Perchance To Dream was also released. Similar to the promo version (P12MUTE248) distributed to nightclub DJs to promote the album, the two-track record was credited to \"V & A\" (referring to the members of Erasure, Vince Clark and Andy Bell, rather than naming them outright). The 12\" was only available from the Mute Records' own shop (Mute Bank) and specialist dance music shops.[citation needed]"@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"Rock 'n' Roll Damnation\" is a single by the Australian rock band AC/DC, and the first track on their Powerage album, released in 1978. The single version is an abbreviated version of the album track, with a time of 3:05, as opposed to the album track's length of 3:37. The album track \"Sin City\" was the B-side in the UK, Germany, Belgium, and Japan. In the US, Canada, and the Netherlands, it was \"Kicked in the Teeth,\" also from the album. In Australia, however, the B-side was \"Cold Hearted Man,\" which appeared on initial UK and European pressings of the album, and was eventually removed when \"Rock 'n' Roll Damnation\" was added (see below). Written by Angus Young, Malcolm Young and Bon Scott, it was played live by the band during the Powerage tour, and was also played live during the 2003 world tour, sung by Brian Johnson, Scott's replacement. It also appeared on the 1978 live album If You Want Blood You've Got It. The song also featured in AC/DC's Iron Man 2 soundtrack. \"Rock 'n' Roll Damnation\" was the final track recorded during the Powerage sessions, after the record company persuaded the band to go back into the studio and come up with a radio-friendly single that could garner some airplay. The move found some success, giving the band its first charting single in the UK where it peaked at #24. The song features handclaps and maracas and does not have a traditional guitar solo, unlike most other AC/DC songs. On the first pressing of the UK version of Powerage, \"Rock 'n' Roll Damnation\" does not appear; side 1 opens with \"Gimme a Bullet\". Some later UK and European pressings tacked the single version of \"Rock 'n' Roll Damnation\" on as the opening track of the album. Eventually the full version of the song became the standard. \"Cold Hearted Man,\" which had appeared on initial UK and European pressings, was removed from the album around the time that \"Rock 'n' Roll Damnation\" was added. However, a 10-track LP including both songs does exist in (at least) the UK (catalog number K 50483 (SD19180), which is identical to the 9-track version), Germany (ATL 50 483), and Portugal (ATL 50483 SD 19180).)"@en ;

dbr:Someone_Saved_My_Life_Tonight	rdf:type	dbo:MusicalWork ;
	dbo:abstract	"\"Someone Saved My Life Tonight\" is an Elton John song from his album Captain Fantastic and the Brown Dirt Cowboy. John originally wrote and recorded it in A-flat, though after vocal cord surgery in 1987 that resulted in him abstaining from using his falsetto range for a period, he more often performed the song in a lower key of F. It concludes side one in the album's narrative, which chronicles the early history of John and lyricist Bernie Taupin and their struggles to find their place within the music industry. When released as the album's only single in 1975, it reached #4 on the Billboard Hot 100 and entered the top 25 on the UK Singles Chart. In the U.S., it was certified Gold on10 September 1975 by the RIAA. In Canada, the single narrowly missed being his ninth number one there, hitting #2 on the RPM 100 national Top Singles chart on August 30. Taupin's lyric refers to a time in 1969, before John was a popular musician, when John was engaged to be married to his girlfriend, Linda Woodrow. John and Woodrow were sharing a flat with Taupin in Furlong Road in London, hence the opening line \"When I think of those East End lights.\" While having serious doubts about the looming marriage, John contemplated suicide. He took refuge in his friends, especially Long John Baldry, who convinced John to abandon his plans to marry in order to salvage and maintain his musical career. Comparisons can also be drawn to the earlier John/Taupin composition Skyline Pigeon - as both songs contain the metaphor of a creature flying free towards the sky to signify escape from marriage. As a sign of his respect and gratitude for Baldry, Taupin wrote him into the song as the \"someone\" in the title, and also as \"Sugar Bear\". Some radio stations altered the song or refused to play it due to the use of the phrase \"Damn it\" in the second verse.[citation needed] In the liner notes to the Deluxe Edition of Captain Fantastic and The Brown Dirt Cowboy, writer Paul Gambaccini related a recollection from producer Gus Dudgeon. During the recording of the song's lead vocal, Dudgeon said he was pushing Elton for more in terms of his delivery of the vocal, not paying attention to the lyric. According to Gambaccini, another member of the production crew, Davey Johnstone, leaned over and told Dudgeon, \"You know he's singing about killing himself.\" Dudgeon was apparently mortified by the revelation and relented. The song, which at 6:45 was one of Elton's longest singles, was supposed to be edited to a shorter version for radio consumption. However, John refused to let MCA Records pare it down, saying that it was to be released as a whole, and the record company acquiesced. John has played the song live many times, one of the best known recorded performances coming during the Central Park concert in September 1980."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"Cleanin' Out My Closet\" is a song by American rapper Eminem from his fourth studio album The Eminem Show (2002). \"Cleanin' Out My Closet\" was the second single released off the album following \"Without Me\". However, unlike the preceding single which was as his humorous Slim Shady persona, \"Cleanin' Out My Closet\" was a serious yet sarcastic song based on his childhood and relationships. It also depicts Eminem venting his anger towards his mother, Debbie Mathers, for the way she raised him. In the hook, Eminem sarcastically apologizes to his mother for hurting her and making her cry but takes it back by showing the world what his mother, according to him, was like. It became the second Top 10 single from the album, reaching number four on the United States Billboard Hot 100 chart, and one of the highest-charting singles of his career. The song did not reach number one on any foreign charts, but was certified Platinum in Australia. \"Cleanin' Out My Closet\" was also used in the initial theatrical trailer to Eminem's film 8 Mile, released in November 2002. With the release of The Marshall Mathers LP 2 in 2013, Eminem apologized to his mother on the track \"Headlights\". He stated (among other things such as wrongfully mocking her drug problem, regretting that he never let his daughters meet their grandmother) that he cringes when he hears \"Cleanin' Out My Closet\" on the radio, and that he does not play the song in concert any more."@en ;

It was written by Beyonc\u00E9, Scott Storch and Robert Waller for her debut solo album Dangerously in Love (2003). Beyonc\u00E9 decided that she wanted a deeper and more personal song for the third single; the song was sent by Columbia Records to US radio on October 19, 2003. \"Me, Myself and I\" is an R&B song about dealing with a philandering boyfriend and learning from the consequences. \"Me, Myself and I\" was generally well received by music critics, who complimented the smooth and assertive vocals of Beyonc\u00E9 and called it a 1980s throwback from Dangerously in Love. The Grammy Award-nominated song earned Beyonc\u00E9, Storch and Waller an American Society of Composers, Authors, and Publishers Pop Music Award. \"Me, Myself and I\" peaked at number four on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart, and became Beyonc\u00E9's fourth consecutive US top five single. It was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). The single reached the top 20 in Australia, the UK and in some European countries. Directed by Johan Renck, the accompanying music video follows the plot of the song's theme and the events in the video are played in reverse. \"Me, Myself and I\" was part of Beyonc\u00E9's set list on the Verizon Ladies First Tour, the Dangerously in Love Tour, The Beyonc\u00E9 Experience and the I Am...

The Swedish synthpop band Universal Poplab covered the song on their 2004 debut eponymous album, in a duet with the Swedish pop singer H\u00E5kan Hellstr\u00F6m. Reel Big Fish covered the song on their 2005 album We're Not Happy 'til You're Not Happy, replacing the lyric \"And if they are Northern\" with \"And if they are No Doubt\". Morrissey claimed that the lyrics were about the music scene in Manchester, with bands contesting for success. On hating it when his friends become successful, he said: \"When my old friend Simon Topping [the frontman of Manchester band A Certain Ratio] appeared on the cover of the NME, I died a thousand deaths of sorrow and lay down in the woods to die.\""@en ;

It was taken from the then-unreleased Your Arsenal album and was the second Morrissey single to be written by Alain Whyte and produced by glam rock legend Mick Ronson. Although the lyrics seemed a typically tongue-in-cheek Morrissey love song towards an overweight person, in reality the words were an in-joke directed at Madness singer Chas Smash whom Morrissey had recently befriended. Smash has since confessed that he is the subject of the song. The title is a pun on the Marvelettes' song You Are The One for Me Bobby. The track reached number 19 in the UK Singles Chart."@en ;

In this song Bush remembers friends and family who have died, including guitarist Alan Murphy, film director Michael Powell, dancer Gary Hurst, lighting engineer Bill Duffield and others. Composer and musician Michael Kamen arranged and conducted the orchestra, expanding on Bush's original piano accompaniment. Bush wrote the chorus \"to those we love, to those who will survive\" for her mother, who was sick at the time of recording. She died a short time later. The Director's Cut version does not feature the chorus. The second track, \"Show a Little Devotion\", is one of Bush's more elusive songs. It only appears on a small handful of CD singles that were released just prior to Christmas 1993. The version of \"December Will Be Magic Again\" that appears on this release is slightly different from all the other mixes previously released. It is basically the same as the original single mix, but it's brighter, and the percussion instruments are different. The CD release also includes \"Experiment IV\" which was released in 1986. The 12\" and cassette releases contain an instrumental version of \"Moments of Pleasure\", which has yet to be released on CD, and a third track entitled \"Home for Christmas\", which was also released on the US \"Rubberband Girl\", CD single.

	dbo:abstract	"Shot Down in the Night is a 1979 song written by Steve Swindells, who was at that time keyboardist with the UK rock group Hawkwind. Swindells and Hawkwind released different versions of the song as a single on 27 June 1980. Hawkwind's version reached #59 in the UK singles chart, being a slightly different version to the one on the album Live Seventy Nine. The song was written by Steve Swindells while rehearsing with Hawkwind (then working under the name \"Hawklords\") at Rockfield Studios in 1979. He presented it to the band, and they agreed on its potential as a future single. However, Swindells was then offered a solo record deal by ATCO, and left Hawkwind to pursue a solo career. His studio version of Shot Down in the Night was released as a single on the same day as Hawkwind's live version. Swindells claims that his version was \"waaay harder, more dramatic and simply better than Hawkwind\u2019s version. In both the battle of the butch and the artistic, the queer won.\" Despite that claim, Simon King (drums) and Huw Lloyd-Langton (guitars) played on both recordings, giving the two versions a musical closeness, although Swindells' gruff vocals perhaps make his version heavier than Dave Brock's folky vocal on Hawkwind's version."@en ;

In the song, the narrator reveals that he is covering up evidence of his imprisoned friends' criminal actions, and speaks of his paranoia, fearing that the police are closing in on him.

dbr:You_Got_Me_Rocking	rdf:type	dbo:MusicalWork ;
	dbo:abstract	"\"You Got Me Rocking\" is a song by the English rock and roll band The Rolling Stones, on their 1994 album Voodoo Lounge. Begun in early in 1993, \"You Got Me Rocking\" was initially a blues number; bootlegs have Jagger and Richards working the song as a slower, blues flavored ramble, with Jagger shouting the hook- \"you got me rocking\". Changed to a straight forward rocker in the vein of \"Start Me Up\", the song quickly evolved into a powerful rock single as Richards made the transition from piano to guitar. The lyrics moved to a more upbeat tone, as singer Mick Jagger presents redemption from a series of career ending instances of various professionals: The lyrics can be interpreted as an answer to the Rolling Stones' critics, who often deride the band for their advancing age. Recording on \"You Got Me Rocking\" lasted from mid-summer to early winter 1993, when final touches were put on. The song was released as a single in the UK in September 1994, where it reached number 23. It was also released as a single in the US but only reached a failing number 113 in 1995. The B-side is the little-known \"Jump on Top of Me\" which also appears on the soundtrack to Pr\u00EAt-\u00E0-Porter. \"You Got Me Rocking\" appeared on the soundtrack to The Replacements in 2000. \"You Got Me Rocking\" is notable as it remains one of the Stones' most enduring live songs, a rarity for a late album song. The song was performed some fifty times during the 2005-2006 A Bigger Bang Tour. A recording from the 1997-1998 Bridges to Babylon Tour opened the 1998 live album No Security. It was also included on the Stones' 2002 career retrospective, Forty Licks."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"Clash City Rockers\" is a song and single by The Clash. First released in February 1978 with the b-side \"Jail Guitar Doors,\" a re-worked version of a song from Joe Strummer's pub rock days. It was later included as the opening track of the belated US version of the band's eponymous debut album. The song was first played live at Mont De Marsan (Landes - France), in August 1977 and recorded the same year in the band's October and November sessions at CBS Studios. Following an argument at the end of the band's Get Out of Control Tour, Paul Simonon and Mick Jones were not on speaking terms, leaving Joe Strummer as a middle-man, relaying instructions and insults from one to the other. In December, producer Mickey Foote (Joe Strummer's old sound-man from the 101'ers and producer of The Clash and \"White Riot\") increased the speed of the tape for the finished master of the song after manager Bernie Rhodes decided the song sounded \"a bit flat.\" This technique, known as \"varispeeding,\" rendered the song one semitone higher in pitch. Strummer and Jones were in Jamaica at the time. When they heard the finished result, Foote was sacked. With the exception of the 2000 re-issue of the US version of The Clash, the original version of the song (at the proper speed) has been used on every re-release since. The Clash's first overt attempt at self-mythology, \"Clash City Rockers\" is, by and large, a song about positivity and moving forward, and revisits themes common in Clash songs of the era, specifically dead-end employment and having a purpose in life. The middle part of the song is based on an old nursery rhyme, \"Oranges and Lemons\", and namechecks The Move, The Groove, David Bowie, Gary Glitter and Prince Far-I; the irony of the line \"when I am fitter say the bells of Gary Glitter\" following his scandal was not lost on Mick Jones, who joked about it in December 2003 of Uncut magazine: The main riff is very reminiscent to The Who's debut single, \"I Can't Explain\"'s main riff, and sounds like it has been expanded by The Clash. This riff was reworked by the band again for \"Guns on the Roof\" on their second album Give 'Em Enough Rope.[citation needed]"@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"Hitsville U.K.\" is a song by The Clash and the second off their fourth album Sandinista!. A duet between lead guitarist Mick Jones and his then-girlfriend Ellen Foley, it's the 13th single release by The Clash. The lyrics refer to the emerging indie scene in British music in the late '70s and early '80s, which is held in contrast to the \"mutants, creeps and musclemen\" of the major labels with their \"expense accounts\" and \"lunch discounts\", making \"AOR\" and using \"chart-hyping\" to sell their records. References are made to a number of UK independent labels (Small Wonder, Rough Trade, Fast Product and Factory). The song's title is a nod to Motown Records, which used the moniker \"Hitsville U.S.A.\" in its advertising and to refer to the label's first headquarters in Detroit. The original UK release had \"Radio One\" by Mikey Dread as the B-side. A second issue released later in 1981 in the U.S. (catalog number 51013) replaced \"Radio One\" with \"Police on My Back\" as the B-side. Like all other Clash singles, the song is also available in the 1991 compilation The Singles.

	dbo:abstract	"\"Live Like You Were Dying\" is a song recorded by American country music artist Tim McGraw for his eighth studio album of the same name (2004). It was written by the songwriting team of Tim Nichols and Craig Wiseman. The duo crafted the song based on family and friends who learned of illnesses(cancers), and how they often had a new perspective on life upon learning they had limited time. They decided to write a song based on the concept, hoping that it might inspire someone in such a situation. The song's lyrics center on experiencing life to its fullest, while also becoming a better person. Released in June 2004 as the lead single from the album, the song became an enormous success in the U.S. It spent seven weeks atop of the Billboard country music charts; the magazine later dubbed it the biggest country song of the year. \"Live Like You Were Dying\" won several awards, including Single of the Year and Song of the Year at the 2004 Country Music Association Awards and at the 2004 Academy of Country Music Awards. The music video, directed by Sherman Halsey, was nominated for Video of the Year at the 2004 Academy of Country Music Awards. It has sold over two million copies in the U.S."@en ;

The \"New Abuse Mix\" is a remixed version of the track in which the heavier, screamed layer of vocals were largely removed and replaced by a more monotone, drone-like sounding layer. The exceptions to the vocal changes lay in the final iterations of the chorus that finish out the song. Additionally, this new version of the track was cut by approximately 00:37 seconds by removing the transitional \"Kill you, fuck you, I will never be you\" section. Selected profanities were also replaced with less offensive phrases; for example, the phrase \"...the everyday bullshit things that you have done\" was substituted with the alternative, \"...the everyday abusive things that you have done\" and \"You fucking touch me, I will rip you apart...\" was replaced with \"...and if you touch me, I will rip you apart...\".

dbr:Stop_the_Cavalry	rdf:type	dbo:MusicalWork ;
	dbo:abstract	"\"Stop the Cavalry\" is a song written and performed by the English musician Jona Lewie. The song peaked at number three in the UK Singles Chart in December 1980, at one point only being kept from number one by two re-issued songs by John Lennon, who had been murdered on 8 December. In an interview for Channel 4's 100 Greatest Christmas Moments, Lewie said that the song was never intended as a Christmas hit, and that it was a protest song. The line 'Wish I was at home for Christmas' as well as the brass band arrangements made it an appropriately styled song to play around Christmas time. The song's promotional video is set in the trenches of the First World War. The lyrics of the song mention cavalry and Churchill (who served as the First Lord of the Admiralty in the first year of the war, prior to serving in the trenches himself), but it breaks with the First World War theme with references to nuclear fallout and the line \"I have had to fight, almost every night, down throughout these centuries\". Lewie described the song's soldier as being \"a bit like the eternal soldier at the Arc de Triomphe\". At the time there was an increase in tension between the West and the Soviet Union, with American-controlled nuclear cruise missiles being stationed in the UK and a renewed fear of nuclear war. That is the context in which this anti-war song was written, and explains the reference to the fallout shelter. The song's melody is loosely based on a theme from Swedish Rhapsody No. 1 by Hugo Alfv\u00E9n, and its major musical elements bear a resemblance to Mozart's Rondo in D Major, K382. \"Stop the Cavalry\" reached #2 in Australia behind Slim Dusty's \"Duncan\". Jona Lewie's version was issued by Stiff Records (catalogue number Buy 104). In 1981, Stiff Records brought together the Gwalia Singers \u2014 a Welsh male voice choir \u2014 and the Cory Band to record a new arrangement of the song (catalogue number Buy 133). This version remains one of the most requested of all holiday songs in parts of the USA. and it has been suggested that it is \"probably the most popular song ever by an artist who never had a charted recording\""@en ;

She co-wrote the song with Benny Benassi, his cousin Alle Benassi (known together as the Benassi Bros.), and songwriter Jenson Vaughan, while the Benassi Bros. co-produced the track with Madonna. Vaughan had worked on the lyrics before sending them to Madonna, who developed the demo into the final version of \"Girl Gone Wild\". The song was confirmed by Madonna as the second single from the album and was released on March 2, 2012, by Interscope Records. Musically, \"Girl Gone Wild\" is a mid-tempo electropop party track that is influenced by four-on-the-floor. The song opens with a prayer and features electronic music elements. After the song was released, Joe Francis, the creator of Girls Gone Wild franchise, threatened to sue Madonna for copyright infringement if she sang the song during her performance at Super Bowl XLVI halftime show. Madonna's representatives stated that she was not aware of either Francis or the lawsuit, and that several songs with the same name had already been released by other artists. The song received mixed reviews from critics, who praised its composition as a return to dance music for Madonna, but criticized its lyrics and believed it failed as album opener on MDNA. \"Girl Gone Wild\" reached the top-ten of the charts in Hungary, Israel, Italy, Russia, South Africa, South Korea and Spain, along with the Billboard digital charts in Greece. It debuted and peaked at number 38 on US Pop Songs due to radio airplay. On the Hot Dance Club Songs chart, \"Girl Gone Wild\" became Madonna's 42nd chart topper, extending her record as the artist with the highest number-one hits on that chart. A black-and-white music video for the song, directed by Mert and Marcus, was released on March 20, 2012. The video features Madonna and a number of male models in different looks, dancing with Ukrainian group Kazaky. It received critical acclaim for the editing and the visuals, while reviewers noted that it took inspiration from several past videos released by Madonna, such as \"Erotica\", \"Justify My Love\", \"Human Nature\" and \"Vogue\". \"Girl Gone Wild\" was performed as the opening song during The MDNA Tour (2012), in a Gothic cathedral setting showing religious iconography, and Madonna and her dancers executing choreography in high-heels."@en ;

ns15:_This_Town	rdf:type	dbo:MusicalWork ;
	dbo:abstract	"\"Down to the River / This Town\" are two songs on a double A-sided single by Feeder, released as the group's third and final single from their seventh album Renegades in 2010, while being their 31st single overall and their third double A-sided single after the 2008 release of \"Tracing Lines / Silent Cry\". Both tracks like the majority of the Renegades album, started off life as tracks first performed live under their Renegades side-project name, but were both only released commercially as Feeder tracks. \"Down to the River\" is the longest track on the Renegades album, running at 5 minutes and 23 seconds being edited down to 4 minutes for single release, while \"This Town\" is one of six songs on the 12 track version of the album to clock in at least two minutes but not go over three, with a total running time of 2 minutes and 57 seconds. When \"Down to the River\" was first played live, setlists would list the song as \"Down to the River\" or simply \"River\" with Grant Nicholas introducing the song as \"Down By the River\". This confusion was further lengthened when the standard edition of Renegades listed the track as \"Down By the River\", while the special edition listed it as \"Down to the River\". Grant Nicholas later confirmed \"Down to the River\" as the correct title and was introduced this way onwards. This is also the first single to be released by the band to include an A-side track recorded not with their main drummer, as \"Down to the River\" features former Mexicolas drummer Tim Trotter while \"This Town\" features their now regular drummer Karl Brazil. Tim played drums on two of the album's tracks, with the other being \"White Lines\". On \"Call Out\", Trotter drums on the track \"Fallen\", which was however a B-side on that single. The single has no new tracks, meaning \"Sending Out Waves\" is the only new track to be released exclusively on any of the album's singles, as \"Fallen\", the b-side to \"Call Out\", was at first a free download to anybody who owned a copy of the Renegades second EP and also appears on the iTunes and Japanese versions of the album. Although there are indeed no new tracks on the vinyl itself, the vinyl sleeve was printed with a code, that if entered on a special section of the Feederweb website, allows the user to download an instrumental version of \"Fallen\". This version unlike the one on the instrumentals promo CD, has no skips in it and have been corrected especially for this download release. The track was used as an instrumental during the 2010-2011 edition of Match of the Day, while the Premier League table was shown. The download was released to tie in with this. \"Down to the River/This Town\", could be seen as Feeder's most low-key single release as although promo CD's were made for airplay, the single included no new material making it more of a single for collectors, while there was no music video produced for the single, making it the first Feeder single release not to include one. The main reason for this was that the band were on tour before the single was released, therefore taking away their time to make one."@en ;

In an interview from Thirty Years of Maximum R&B Live, Townshend declared \"Dreaming from the Waist\" as one of his least favorite songs to play onstage (referring to it as a \"fresh turd\" at the conclusion of song's performance at the band's one-off show at Kilburn in December 1977); in humorous contrast, John Entwistle, claimed in the same series of interviews that \"Dreaming from the Waist\" was one of his favorite songs to perform."@en ;

Lyrically the song borrows directly from the short story \"The Sphinx\" by Edgar Allan Poe. Specifically the lyric \"what is termed a landslide of principal proportion\" is taken from the line \"what is termed a land-slide, of the principal portion of its trees\"; and the lyric \"prism perfect\" from the line \"in shape a perfect prism.\" It was remixed by house music producer Armand van Helden (marketed as \"Armand's Star Trunk Funkin' Mix\"), and reached number one on the UK Singles Chart, and the Hot Dance Music/Club Play chart in the U.S. The song was then further remixed by artist Mr. Roy, spawning an entirely new CD-single of remixes that again charted."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"777-9311\" is the second track and lead single from The Time's second album, What Time Is It?. Recorded for the album at Prince's home studio in May\u2013June 1982, the song was produced, arranged, composed and performed by Prince with Morris Day later adding his lead vocals. The funky song opens with a drum machine beat, adds guitar, live playing on the cymbals and finally the bass and keyboards. A similar extended version of this occurs after the main lyrics, but starts with the bass and also includes a lengthy rock guitar solo. The bass is truly the \"star\" of this song, and Prince has remarked that this is one of his signature basslines, remarking no one can play the line like himself. He also said the same about the bassline of \"Let's Work\". Despite the song being performed nearly entirely by Prince, Day calls out \"Terry\" before the bass solo. The U.S. 7\" single was backed with a non-album track, \"Grace\", which is a mock-interview between a cocky Day and an interviewer named Bridgette, who Day keeps referring to as \"Grace\". Bridgette is played by Vanity. The 12\" single was backed with \"The Walk\", where Morris also banters with Vanity and calls her \"Grace\", though it's not known if it is meant to be the reporter once again. \"777-9311\" reached number two on the R&B charts and number 88 on the pop charts. It is one of The Time's signature numbers and is played at nearly all of their concerts. A live version of the song recorded in concert, 1998 segues from \"Get It Up\" and was included on Day's 2004 album, It's About Time. The song's title, \"777-9311\", was Dez Dickerson's actual telephone number at the time the song was written, causing his phone to ring off the hook until he had his number changed."@en ;

The music video for \"Fool\" was directed by Phil Harder. Paul Draper was particularly dismissive of the track calling it his 'least favourite Mansun track'. Writing in the liner-notes to Legacy: The Best of Mansun, he describes \"Fool\" as an ironic song inspired by a book on songwriting by Jimmy Webb. The song played a part in further straining relations between Draper and the label: 'Bowie intro, comical chorus lyrics and guess what? The label (Parlophone) wanted it as a fucking single!

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/New_Power_Generation_(song)>	rdf:type	dbo:MusicalWork ;
	dbo:abstract	"\"New Power Generation\", or \"N.P.G.\", is a song by American musician Prince from the 1990 album and film, Graffiti Bridge. It is an anthem for his backing band, The New Power Generation, who were officially co-credited on his album covers for a time, and continue to back him up, albeit with a changing lineup. The song saw minimal chart attention, and was not as successful as its predecessor, \"Thieves in the Temple\". \"N.P.G.\" is a funk number featuring drumming by Morris Day, and vocal help by Rosie Gaines. The funk is cut by some carnival-like organ playing and distorted guitar. The song is generally a positive message of overcoming odds. The part two continuation of the song features contributions from a number of artists, as well as samples of several unreleased songs. Tevin Campbell and Mavis Staples sing in part two, and a rap is delivered by T.C. Ellis. Unreleased songs sampled include \"My Tree\", \"Oobee Doop\", and \"Positive Place\". The B-side for the single was \"New Power Generation, pt. 2\", also from Graffiti Bridge. The 12\" and CD maxi release contained numerous previously unheard remixes and bonus material. It began with a \"Funky Weapon Remix\" of \"N.P.G.\", which combined parts one and two of the song, but removed all other vocals other than Prince. Next was \"T.C.'s Rap\". This mix was the \"True Confessions\" rap by rapper T.C. Ellis, whom Prince would later assist on a 1991 album. Another rap follows called \"Brother with a Purpose\". The main song was slowed down, and Tony M. delivers an original rap atop the tune. \"Get Off\" is next, which is a new song over the beat of \"N.P.G.\" Some ideas from this track would later be incorporated in the similarly titled \"Gett Off\" from Diamonds and Pearls. \"Get Off\" is then incorporated into \"The Lubricated Lady\". The final track is a song about a threesome called \"Loveleft, Loveright\", which itself was sampled in \"New Power Generation, pt. 2\". The song ends with the same spoken segment from Prince that begins the EP. The 12\" single released in the UK included \"Melody Cool\" (Extended Remix), sung by Mavis Staples. In Japan, the CD maxi single included all the tracks from the US maxi single, plus those from \"Thieves in the Temple\"."@en ;

The song was written, co-produced and co-composed by Utada herself, while additional production was handled by her father, Japanese producer Teruzane Utada and Akira Miyake. The song was used on her greatest hits compilation Utada Hikaru Single Collection Vol. 1 (2004). The conception for the track was first recorded and written while she was in progress off Deep River, but she put off all work for the single and album after she was diagnosed with an benign ovarian tumor, which caused her to stop all musical activity. Musically, the song is a dance-oriented song that is particularly different from her previous efforts. The song incorporates traditional house music and disco music. The music composition was composed by Utada like her previous singles and contains instrumentation of synthesizers, keyboards, electric guitars and bass guitars, which is similar to the tracks on the parent album. Lyrically, the song talks about traveling through a dream and differentiating the difference between reality and fantasy, incorporating the theme off spirituality throughout the track. \"Traveling\" achieved favorable reception from most contemporary music critics, who praised the production values and vocal delivery. Many critics have also cited the song as one of the album's and her career highlight. The song was a commercial success, peaking at number one on the Daily and Weekly Oricon Chart, becoming her sixth single to do so. The song peaked at number two on the Yearly Chart, only just behind Japanese recording artist Ayumi Hamasaki's EP single H, which was the only release to sell over one million units. The song was certified million by Recording Industry Association of Japan (RIAJ) for shipments off one million units within Japan, despite selling over 850,000 units. An accompanying music video for \"Traveling\" was directed by Utada's ex-husband, Kazuaki Kiriya and features Utada on a train traveling through a computer generated world with passengers with a variety off colored costumes and clothes. The music video was commercially successful, peaking at number one on the DVD chart in Japan. The song was performed during Utada's two date concert series Wild Life in December 2010, and has never been performed on live television."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"Baby, Baby I Need You\" is a 1963 song recorded by The Temptations for the Gordy (Motown) label. It was written by Smokey Robinson, and was later used as the B-side to their Top 40 1964 hit \"Girl (Why You Wanna Make Me Blue)\". The song is about one's devotion to the one they love; it's narrator telling the girl he's falling for that if she let their \u201Chearts combine\u201D that he vows to always let her know how much he needs, wants, and loves her. A fusion of Gospel and Doo-Wop, the song is mostly an ensemble piece, with all the original members singing most of the song's lead vocal in unison (with Eddie Kendricks' higher falsetto voice making him the primary vocal in song). It is on the song\u2019s bridge and outro where Kendricks and Paul Williams each sing a few lead lines out front while Elbridge \"Al\" Bryant sings harmony vocals behind Kendricks and Williams (and throughout the song's bridge). All the group members get a chance to also be heard outfront when they sing the last word of each of the song's three verses in a five-part harmony (Bryant, Williams, Kendricks, Otis Williams, and Melvin Franklin respectively). This B-side is the last single released to feature Bryant's vocals (he was fired several months prior), and the last to feature Paul Williams' signing lead that would be released while he was still the group's main lead singer (although he would still record a few more leads). With the release of the single \"My Girl\", newest member David Ruffin would become The Tempts' new main lead (more or less replacing both Williams and Kendricks in the role). Although \"Baby, Baby I Need You\" did not chart nationally, the song was a regional smash hit in some parts of the country. It was a favorite of fans of the group (and the group itself) and became a part of the Temptations' onstage repertoire. The song was performed by the \"classic five\" members on the group's first live album, Temptations Live! where it received a standing ovation. In 1966, The Wailers, featuring Bob Marley, covered the song (retitled \"I Need You\") which was released as a single and included on the 1966 compilation album, The Wailing Wailers. The Wailers also recorded a different song of the title \"I Need You\" in 1964, and so recent releases have retitled this cover as \"I Need You So\"."@en ;

Based on heavy bhangra elements, a popular music and dance form from the Punjab state of India, the song features a six-note base that is a Punjabi melody played on a tumbi, a stringed Indian instrument. Released as the album's first single in 2001, the track reached number seven on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart. Internationally, \"Get Ur Freak On\" became a top ten success in the Netherlands and the United Kingdom, where it became her first solo top ten hit, peaking at number four. A remix of the song featuring Nelly Furtado was a dance club hit during this period, and was used both in the soundtrack and in the background of the movie Lara Croft: Tomb Raider (2001) starring Angelina Jolie. The song is also heard in The Rundown (2003) starring Dwayne Johnson (remixed with AC/DC's \"Back in Black\") and The 40-Year-Old Virgin (2005) starring Steve Carell. In December, the song was listed 14th on Rolling Stone's Best Songs of the Decade ranking, and later at number 466 on their The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time updated list of 2010. In 2002, \"Get Ur Freak On\" was named the best single released in the year 2001 by The Village Voice's Pazz & Jop annual year-end critics' poll. The song also lists at number seven on Pitchfork Media's Top 500 Songs of the 2000s and number 16 on VH1's Greatest Songs of Hip-Hop. In 2011, NME placed it at number 17 on its list \"150 Best Tracks of the Past 15 Years\". In April 2014, the song was remixed with The Black Keys' song \"Keep Me\" for the original soundtrack to Neighbors (2014). On the Billboard magazine issue dated February 21, 2015, \"Get Ur Freak On\" re-entered at #40, more than a decade after its original chart run. This re-entry was spawned by Missy Elliott's performance at the Super Bowl XLIX halftime show that occurred earlier in the month."@en ;

It was released as the lead single from the album by Radioactive Records on December 20, 1994. The song was written by Lords, Wonder Schneider and Ben Watkins. Produced by Juno Reactor, \"Control\" is a techno song with ambiguous lyrics about a dominant female who nurses a broken heart of her lover. Lords later stated she initially wrote the song about a drug addiction. The song received positive reviews from music critics. In the United States, it failed to enter the Billboard Hot 100. However, it managed to be successful on the Billboard Hot Dance Club Songs chart, peaking at number two. In the United Kingdom, the song also noted a commercial success, peaking at number eighty-one on the UK Singles Chart. An instrumental version of \"Control\" was released on the soundtrack to the film Mortal Kombat (1995), which was certified double platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), and earned Lords her first music award. The accompanying music video for \"Control\" was directed by Greame Joyce. Inspired by James Bond, Lords portrays the female version of the character driving and walking in the streets of Los Angeles. She also portrays the character of Jill Masterson from the film Goldfinger (1964), when various images are projected on Lords' body as well as being depicted as the \"golden girl\" from that film. Her long-time collaborator John Waters also appears in the video."@en ;

The song was composed and produced within a few hours after Wasserman viewed early footage of the original series. A cover of the song, performed by Noam Kaniel, has been used as the show's intro theme since 2011, starting with the 18th season of the franchise, Power Rangers Samurai. A rearrangement of Kaniel's version was used for 2013's Power Rangers Megaforce, changing some lyrics to reflect that season.

	dbo:abstract	"\"John the Fisherman\" is the first single by the alternative metal band Primus, released first live in 1989 on Suck on This, then re-released a year later, this time studio recorded, on Frizzle Fry. Although the band did release the song as a single and filmed a video for it (featuring the band members performing the song on a boat, with a cameo appearance by Kirk Hammett of Metallica, who has been a close friend of Claypool since they attended the same school), the single had very limited success due to its being released on an indie label, and the band did not receive mainstream attention until their next single, \"Jerry Was a Race Car Driver\", from their 1991 major label debut Sailing the Seas of Cheese. Because of this, many overlook \"John the Fisherman\" and claim \"Jerry Was a Race Car Driver\" was Primus' first single. When Frizzle Fry was re-released in 2002, many fans who caught on during the major label days of the band bought the album, and it became a fan favorite. There was a new interest in this song, and it received some radio and MTV airplay. \"John The Fisherman\" is the first part of a four-part story called the \"Fisherman's Chronicles\", which continued on Primus' later albums. Its immediate sequel was \"Fish On (Fisherman Chronicles, Chapter II)\" on 1991's Sailing the Seas of Cheese, followed by \"The Ol' Diamondback Sturgeon (Fisherman's Chronicles, Pt. 3)\" on 1993's Pork Soda and most recently \"Last Salmon Man (Fisherman's Chronicles, Part IV)\" on 2011's Green Naugahyde.

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lady_Friend_(song)>	rdf:type	dbo:MusicalWork ;
	dbo:abstract	"\"Lady Friend\" is a song by the American rock band The Byrds, written by David Crosby and released as a single on July 13, 1967. The single reached #82 on the Billboard Hot 100 but failed to chart in the United Kingdom. In America and Europe the B-side of \"Lady Friend\" was the Chris Hillman song \"Old John Robertson\" but in the UK the single's B-side was changed to \"Don't Make Waves\", a song written by Roger McGuinn and Chris Hillman. The version of \"Old John Robertson\" found on the B-side of \"Lady Friend\" is a substantially different mix from the version that would later appear on The Notorious Byrd Brothers album. \"Lady Friend\" is notable for being the only song penned solely by David Crosby to appear on the A-side of a Byrds' single. The song was written by Crosby in early 1967 at his home in Beverly Glen in Los Angeles. A demo of the song dating from this period, featuring Crosby accompanying himself on acoustic guitar, was included in the KPFA program The Crosby Connection, during the radio station's February 3, 2001 Grateful Dead marathon. The Byrds' recording of the song has a quick tempo and features chiming guitars, complex vocal harmonies and brass, resulting in the fastest and rockiest single The Byrds had released up to that point. Crosby closely oversaw the protracted recording of the song, much to McGuinn and Hillman's consternation. Tensions in the band increased in the late stages of production when Crosby replaced his bandmates' backing vocals with his own vocal overdubs. Crosby was hopeful that \"Lady Friend\" would return The Byrds to the upper reaches of the chart but the record received insufficient airplay and media exposure, despite the band performing it on The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson, and ultimately it failed commercially. Crosby was bitterly disappointed by the single's lack of success and cited producer Gary Usher's mixing of the song as a contributing factor, stating in a contemporary interview with disc jockey B. Mitchel Reed \"The final mix of 'Lady Friend' sounds like mush.\" The Byrds performed \"Lady Friend\" during their appearance at the Monterey Pop Festival and a recording of this performance can be found on the 1992 The Monterey International Pop Festival CD box set. The song was omitted from The Byrds' next album, The Notorious Byrd Brothers, partly due to its lack of commercial success as a single and partly due to Crosby having been fired from the band by McGuinn and Hillman midway through the recording of the album. Having initially been mixed in mono for its release as a single in 1967, \"Lady Friend\" wasn't released in stereo until its inclusion on the 1987 compilation album, Never Before. However, this version of the song also featured the addition of overdubbed drums, played by an unnamed session musician. Reaction to the new drumming on the song amongst fans was almost universally negative, with many feeling that the addition of 1980s sounding drums was completely inappropriate and incongruous. Subsequently, this doctored version of the song has not appeared on any other album release. A new stereo remix of the song, without the 1980s overdubs, was released on The Byrds box set in 1990. The song was also added as a bonus track to the 1996 Columbia/Legacy reissue of the Younger Than Yesterday album. In addition to its appearance on the expanded reissue of Younger Than Yesterday, \"Lady Friend\" also appears on several Byrds' compilations, including History of The Byrds, The Original Singles: 1967\u20131969, Volume 2, The Essential Byrds and There Is a Season. \"Lady Friend\" has been covered by Little John, on their 1969 album, Little John, and by The Flamin' Groovies, on their 1979 album, Jumpin' in the Night. The song was also covered by Static on the 1989 Byrds' tribute album, Time Between \u2013 A Tribute to The Byrds. In 2001, The Posies released a version of the song as part of their Nice Cheekbones and a Ph.D EP. In addition, Kenny Howes has also recorded a version of the song as the title track of his 2004 album, Lady Friend. Bill Plummer And The Cosmic Brotherhood also covered the Song on their 1968 Self Titled Album"@en ;

The song peaked at #59 on the Billboard R&B chart. In La Toya's 1991 autobiography, La Toya: Growing up in the Jackson Family, she revealed that Michael changed production at the last minute to make sure that it would not overshadow the success of his album Off the Wall. The said mix of the song is rumored to have appeared in the Jackson family auction in Las Vegas as item 553 \"Night Time Lover Monitor Mix 2-12-80\". Bobby DeBarge of Switch, Jackson's love interest, wrote the 1980 song \"You and I\" in response. The song begins: \"You know, I was listening to the radio the other day, And I heard the words that you said that I'm your Night Time Lover.\" The track \"Lovely Is She\" (also on the album) was on the B-side of the single. Jackson performed the song on the November 10, 1980 episode of the Dutch TV program TopPop and a month later on the December 13 episode of American Bandstand.

This single was performed by the final two contestants - Leith and Jessica Mauboy - during the penultimate episode of Australian Idol 2006, and both contestants recorded and had their versions pressed by Sony BMG, ready for the winner's version to be released immediately after the competition.

In less than 72 hours of \"Night of My Life\" being on sale, the single was certified Gold status. The single debuted at number one on the ARIA Singles Chart on 3 December, while certified Platinum after one week of sales. It was the fastest selling debut single for 2006, and was the most added song to radio. This single was the first Australian act to reach the #1 spot since Youth Group's, \"Forever Young\" in April 2006. It remained at number one for five consecutive weeks. Despite being released at the end of 2006, the single's strong sales placed \"Night of My Life\" at number eleven in the 2006 End of Year Top 100 ARIA Singles Chart. In mid-December, Jessica Mauboy's version of the song was released online by a New Zealand website which released it for legal download, even though she did not win Australian Idol.

However, it still remains available for illegal download online, and also remains available on the DVD accompaniment to her newly released album+DVD. The single was later released in Ireland and debuted at number ten on 18 January 2007, rising to number eight the week after."@en ;

The single was released as a limited edition double 7\" disc with three accompanying tracks, and as a single 7\" both as two track and three track discs with the same catalogue number.The single version is slightly different from the album version in sound mix and lyrics; the line \"..someone's gone liquid in the sheets..\" on the original (album) version is replaced by \"..someone's gone missing in the sheets..\". The record entered the UK charts at no. 32, remaining at the same position for a further week before dropping down. Unlike Underpass, This was the final single release from Metamatic. The single version is featured on the John Foxx compilation albums \"Modern Art - The Best of John Foxx\" (2001) and \"Glimmer - Best of John Foxx\" (2008).

The song uses an analogy of a common childhood fear of a windstorm to frame a young man's failing relationship with a woman. Here, the protagonist recalls being comforted by his mother as a gusting, howling wind smacks the screen door and causes him to be frightened. The scene then shifts to the present, where he reveals his relationship difficulties and a fight that causes the woman to leave. Upon hearing the screen door slam shut, he remembers his childhood and wishes aloud that her leaving is just temporary (\"It's only the wind, and nothing more/not the end of my world, walking out the door\"), knowing that in this case, he has no one to comfort him."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"The Man Don't Give a Fuck\" is a song by Super Furry Animals, twice released as a single by the group. It is based round a sample from the Steely Dan song \"Show Biz Kids\" - \"You know they don't give a fuck about anybody else\". The sample is repeated more than 50 times and so the single is claimed to feature the word \"fuck\" more than any other song, but Insane Clown Posse's \"Fuck the World\" in fact beats it with 93 instances. However, the live re-issue of \"The Man Don't Give A Fuck\" broke that record. The song was originally intended as a B-side for previous single \"If You Don't Want Me to Destroy You\" but the group had not been able to clear the sample in time. However, they persevered and when they were able to clear the sample, released the song as a single in its own right. This arguably sealed the song's cult status among SFA fans, and it became the group's standard set-closer when playing live: the outro would often extend to ten or twenty minutes, with keyboard player Cian Ciaran in particular taking the opportunity to improvise wildly around the basic sample. A live version was released in 2004. In October 2011, NME placed it at number 66 on its list \"150 Best Tracks of the Past 15 Years\"."@en ;

The song is mainly instrumental, except for some ad-libbing by Chas Smash at the beginning, the sound of \"Waiter!\" approximately 42 seconds into the track, and \"Good night!\" at the very end. Dave Robinson, head of Stiff Records, was keen on Madness recording another instrumental track, especially after the success of \"One Step Beyond...\".

dbr:We_R_Who_We_R	rdf:type	dbo:MusicalWork ;
	dbo:abstract	"\"We R Who We R\" (abbreviation for \"We Are Who We Are\") is a song by American recording artist and songwriter Kesha from her first extended play (EP), Cannibal (2010). The song was released as the EP's lead single on October 22, 2010. It was written by Kesha, with Jacob Kasher Hindlin, Dr. Luke, Benny Blanco and Ammo. Production of the song was completed by Dr. Luke, Blanco, and Ammo. In the wake of news that bullying had led to multiple suicides of gay youth, Kesha wrote the song in hopes that it would become a pride anthem. The song is intended to inspire people to be themselves, and as a celebration of anyone deemed quirky or eccentric. Musically, the song is a dance-pop song that incorporates elements of electropop and techno; it uses a synth-infused beat as a backing with sounds interpreted as hand claps. Kesha's vocals have been described as a talk-singing style that use layered Auto-Tune in some parts and vocoders.The song has been compared to her debut single \"Tik Tok\" (2009), as it has a similar musical structure. Reception of \"We R Who We R\" has been generally positive. Although it was criticized for not being particularly different from Kesha's previous work, reviewers felt that the song was a strong dance-pop number that combined a good rhythm with an inspiring message filled with genuine humor. \"We R Who We R\" debuted at number one on the Billboard Hot 100, making it the 17th song in the chart's history to do so. The song also reached number one in the United Kingdom, Kesha's first number one solo single there, and topped the charts in Australia for three weeks. It also attained top-five positions on the Canadian, Japanese, and New Zealand charts. The song became Kesha's fifth consecutive solo top ten hit in the United States, Canada, and Australia. As of June 2014, the song has sold over 4,047,000 digital copies in the United States. The song's accompanying music video was directed by Hype Williams and was filmed in downtown Los Angeles. The video is presented as an underground party and has been described as showcasing a darker and sexier side of Kesha compared to previous videos. The song has been performed in North America at the 2010 American Music Awards, and on her worldwide Get Sleazy Tour."@en ;

It was written after Sheeran visited a homeless shelter and heard some of the stories of the lives people had been living. Making the song upbeat and using the line \"Class A Team\" was his way of masking the heavy subject matter. He wrote the song following a last-minute performance at an event for the homeless.

The song received acclaim from critics, who commended the lyrics and production and Sheeran's vocal performance. It became a top 10 hit in Australia, Germany, Ireland, Israel, Japan, Luxembourg, New Zealand, Norway, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom. It debuted at number three on the UK Singles Chart, with sales of 57,607 copies.

dbr:Get_Your_Gunn	rdf:type	dbo:MusicalWork ;
	dbo:abstract	"Released in 1994, \"Get Your Gunn\" is the first official single by alternative metal band Marilyn Manson. \"Snake Eyes and Sissies\" was originally planned as the lead single but never released; \"Get Your Gunn\" was released instead. The track was released to support the album Portrait of an American Family, and was the first release from Nothing Records. A video was also released, but did not receive significant airplay. The boy on the single's cover is Wes Brown, half-brother of bassist Twiggy Ramirez. The song charted in Canada. The song was inspired by the 1993 murder of OB/GYN doctor David Gunn (hence the spelling) who was killed in Florida by self-proclaimed pro-life activist Michael Frederic Griffin. Vocalist Marilyn Manson later described his murder as \"the ultimate hypocrisy I witnessed growing up: that these people killed someone in the name of being 'pro-life'.\" The bridge of \"Get Your Gunn\" includes audio from the press conference at which American politician Budd Dwyer shot himself, as well as the gunshot that killed him. Additional saxophone playing is provided by Sugarsmack vocalist Hope Nicholls. During the Columbine High School massacres aftermath, several news outlets reported that the two shooters were fans of Marilyn Manson, and the song was blamed for inspiring the massacre. Marilyn Manson replied in a letter published in Rolling Stone. A PRS for Music survey conducted in 2010 revealed that the British public considered \"Get Your Gunn\" the 8th most controversial of all time. The song is also featured as downloadable content for Guitar Hero: Warriors of Rock as part of the \"February Mega Pack.\" The song is also included on Portrait Sessions (a bootleg tape), as well as the The Manson Family Album (a prior version of Portrait of an American Family, before Trent Reznor got involved), the compilation album Lest We Forget: The Best Of and the live album The Last Tour on Earth. The song was featured in the movie S.F.W. and also in the movie Strange Days, although it does not appear on the soundtrack. \"Misery Machine\" is listed as the album version but does not include the hidden track on Portrait of an American Family. The version on the single is cross-faded into \"Mother Inferior Got Her Gunn\"."@en ;

The instrumental (\"Toca Me\") was written by Dirk Duderstadt, Marco Duderstadt, Ramon Zenker and the lyrics (of \"I Need a Miracle\") were written by Rob Davis and Victor Imbres, while some of the song's production was produced by Ramon Zenker, the vocals were produced many years earlier by Imbres and Tim Orford. The song was critically acclaimed worldwide, with many critics citing the song one of the best dance anthems of all time, praising its catchy tune. The song was also a commercial success, remaining both Star's and Fragma's best selling single to date. The song topped the UK Singles Chart in April 2000 and peaked inside the top ten in countries including Ireland, Denmark, Norway, Italy and Australia. A music video was issued, depicting Coco Star at an indoor football game. The song was re-issued in 2008 by Tiger Records with new remixes. The song also received mixed reviews from music critics, but managed to gain commercial success around the globe. Additionally, a new music video was issued for the single, but did not feature Star in the video. The song was then once again re-released in 2012 by Tiger Records.

It is the first of the four-part \"Neighborhood\" series found on Funeral. \"Tunnels\" was the band's first single, released several months before the album as a 7\" vinyl record on June 20, 2004, to a pressing of 1500 copies. The B-side to the album is a recording of the song \"My Buddy\" by swing musician Alvino Rey. Rey is the maternal grandfather of Arcade Fire members Win and William Butler. In August 2009, the song was named #10 on Pitchfork Media's \"Top 500 Tracks of the 2000s\". In a 2012 Beats Per Minute article on The Essential Arcade Fire, it was named the band's most essential track by writer Lucien Flores. Flores writes, \"'Tunnels' has all the elements of a great Arcade Fire song: a head-bobbing rhythm section, lyrics that harken back to an imperfect past, a seamless blend of instruments, and a cathartic coda.\""@en ;

The single's promotion fell through due to the merging of Capitol & Virgin Records, LeToya Luckett, Mims, Cherish, and Chingy had cancelled third singles, and Chingy was let go from the label, while J.

Ivy Lynn (Megan Hilty) reprises the song in the eleventh episode of Season 2, entitled \"The Dress Rehearsal\", as part of Broadway previews for Bombshell.

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Baby,_Baby_Don\u0027t_Cry>	rdf:type	dbo:MusicalWork ;
	dbo:abstract	"\"Baby, Baby Don't Cry\", released in December 1968, is a single recorded by The Miracles for Motown Records' Tamla label. The composition was written by Miracles lead singer Smokey Robinson, Motown staff writers Al Cleveland and Terry Johnson, a former member of The Flamingos. Robinson, Johnson, and Miracles member Warren \"Pete\" Moore were the song's producers. \"Baby Baby Don't Cry\" was a top 10 pop hit for The Miracles, peaking at number eight on the Billboard Hot 100 in the United States, and at a Top 10 R&B hit as well,peaking as number three on Billboard's R&B singles chart.It sold over one million copies , and has inspired cover versions by Gerald Wilson and His Orchestra, and Projekt. The song is noted for Smokey's spoken recitation at the beginning as well as before the second verse. The spoken lines are: \"Nothing so blue as a heart in pain/Nothing so sad as a tear in vain\", and \"You trusted him and gave him your love/A love he proved unworthy of\". The song uses an extended bridge that repeats the minor and diminished chords before going up half a step for the final repeated Choruses. Although not given writing credit on this particular tune, Miracle Marv Tarplin's outstanding guitar work plays an important role in this song,his gentle but effective riffs being evident from the song's beginning,giving a \"raindrop\" effect reminiscent of someone crying (the song's main theme). The Miracles performed this song on a 1969 Telecast of The Mike Douglas Show, a performance that was re-broadcast many years later on VH-1. The success of this song ended a period of relatively mediocre chart action for The Miracles during 1968, and set the stage for their biggest hit ever with Smokey as lead singer, 1970's multi- million selling # 1 hit The Tears of a Clown .

	dbo:abstract	"\"Give It 2 Me\" is a song by American singer and songwriter Madonna, featured on her 11th studio album Hard Candy. It was released on June 24, 2008 by Warner Bros. Records as the second single from the album. The song was written by Madonna as an anthemic, self-manifesto song which, although it appears to be about dance and sex, is a reference to Madonna's career spanning three decades in the music industry. Musically, \"Give It 2 Me\" is an upbeat dance-pop song, featuring instrumentation from West African percussion and cowbells. Backing vocals are provided by Pharrell Williams. \"Give It 2 Me\" received positive reviews from contemporary critics. The song became Madonna's 39th number-one single on the Billboard Hot Dance Club Play chart. It charted on the Billboard Hot 100 for one week, and reached a peak of 57 only, due to limited radio play. The song topped the music charts in Hungary, the Netherlands and Spain, while it peaked within the top ten of the charts in many other nations, including Canada, Denmark and the United Kingdom. The music video featured Madonna recreating her look from the Elle magazine May covergirl photo shoot, and was directed by photographer Tom Munro. Williams had a guest appearance in the video. It received positive response for her retro-inspired look. Madonna performed \"Give It 2 Me\" on both the promotional tour for Hard Candy, and the 2008\u201309 Sticky & Sweet Tour. The song was additionally performed at a special concert for The MDNA Tour at Madison Square Garden in 2012. \"Give It 2 Me\" received a Grammy nomination in 2009 in the Best Dance Recording category."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"(Come 'Round Here) I'm the One You Need\" is a 1966 hit single by Motown group The Miracles, released on Motown Records' Tamla label. Unlike most Miracles songs, which were written and produced by the group themselves, \"I'm the One You Need\" was written and produced by Motown's main songwriting and production team Holland\u2013Dozier\u2013Holland, best known for their work with The Supremes and The Four Tops. Holland-Dozier-Holland had written and produced two previous Miracles singles: the Top 10 hit \"Mickey's Monkey\" and the Top 40 hit \"I Gotta Dance to Keep From Crying\" (both 1963). \"I'm the One You Need\" was the final Miracles single released before lead singer Smokey Robinson was given star billing on the group's 45's. In this popular Miracles tune, Smokey Robinson, as the song's narrator, seeks to comfort a girl he obviously loves, who belongs to another man who cheats on her, and treats her badly: With the solution,to the broken-hearted girl's problem, Smokey continues... While Smokey sings lead, The other Miracles, Bobby, Ron, Pete, and Claudette, back him with repeated chants of \"Come 'Round Here,Honey Honey...I'm the one you need,Honey Honey\"... Two versions of this song were released, with very notable changes. The first version was released on the single; this version also appears on mono copies of the Miracles' 1966 album Away We a Go-Go. The second version used a different take, was in stereo, and had Smokey's lead more prominent than the single version; this version was released on the stereo LP editions of the album. The single was a Top 20 Pop Hit,peaking at number 17 on the Billboard Hot 100, and a Top 10 R&B hit, peaking at number four on Billboard's R&B singles chart. It was also a Top 20 hit in the UK, but not until February 1971, when it peaked at number 13. \"(Come 'Round Here) I'm the One You Need\" was the most successful single featured on their album Away We a Go-Go, and has been covered by acts such as The Jackson 5, The Cowsills, and The GP's . In 1967 The Miracles themselves recorded an Italian language version, entitled Non sono quello che tu vuoi (I'm not that man you want). The song's \"B\" side, \"Save Me\" was covered in a 1966 ska version as \"Rude Boy Prayer\" by a group consisting of Alton Ellis, Zoot Sims, Bob Marley and an unknown female vocalist. Despite being highly regarded, this version remains officially unavailable outside its original blank labelled 7\" vinyl release. The Undertones also covered the song."@en ;

The song was not successful on the rock charts as it failed to chart on any because the song was considered too light for both rock and alternative radio stations with the song only having success on both pop and adult contemporary stations. The song was written by lead singer Rob Thomas and producer Matt Serletic, and is about a romantic relationship that seems to have reached its end, much to the chagrin of the singer. It has also been said, by Thomas in particular, that the song is about being in a relationship, drinking, and then cheating on the person you're with. Another explanation provided by the lead singer is that it's about \"screwing up so often that you become used to it.\""@en ;

It is based on an Andrew Loog Oldham orchestral version of The Rolling Stones' song \"The Last Time\", from which it samples a main theme, and involved some legal controversy surrounding a plagiarism charge as a result. Consequently, Mick Jagger and Keith Richards were added to the songwriting credits. \"Bitter Sweet Symphony\" was released on 16 June 1997 by Hut Recordings as the first single from the album, reaching number two on the UK Singles Chart and stayed in the chart for three months. The song's momentum built slowly in the U.S. throughout the latter months of 1997, ultimately leading to a CD single release on 3 March 1998 by Virgin Records America, helping the song to reach number 12 on the Billboard Hot 100. The song's music video, which received heavy rotation on MTV, focuses on Richard Ashcroft lip-synching the song while walking down a busy London pavement, oblivious to what is going on around and refusing to change his stride or direction throughout. At the 1998 Brit Awards, \"Bitter Sweet Symphony\" was nominated for Best British Single, and at the 1998 MTV Video Music Awards, the song was nominated for Video of the Year, Best Group Video, and Best Alternative Video. In 1999, the song was nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Rock Song."@en ;

OMI first began developing the song in 2008, when he created its melody. It was refined over several years alongside famed Jamaican producer Clifton Dillon. It was first recorded with veteran session musicians Sly and Robbie and Dean Fraser. Released as a single on independent label Oufah, the song saw success in Jamaica, where it topped the charts, and also attracted airplay in Hawaii and Dubai. The song's lyrics depict a romantic companion as a support system. Hoping to connect the song to a wider audience, OMI signed to U.S. dance label Ultra Music in 2013. Ultra contacted two disc jockeys to produce remixed versions of the original song. The label and song's producers preferred one remix, produced by a young German DJ, Felix Jaehn, that eschewed much of the song's original instrumentation for a tropical-flavored deep house rendition, prominently featuring a trumpet, a conga beat, and piano. A remix extended play was released in May 2014 by Ultra, which began to first see commercial success that fall. \"Cheerleader\" became a massive global success in 2015, reached number one in 20 countries, including the United States, the United Kingdom, Mexico, Australia, France, Sweden and Germany."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"Come on-a My House\" is a song performed by Rosemary Clooney on her album Come On-A My House, released on June 6, 1951. The song was written by Ross Bagdasarian and his cousin, the Armenian American Pulitzer Prize winning author William Saroyan, in the summer of 1939, while driving across New Mexico. The melody is based on an Armenian folk song. It was not performed until the 1950, off-Broadway production of The Son. The song did not become a hit until the release of Clooney's recording. It was probably Saroyan's only effort at popular songwriting, and it was one of Bagdasarian's few well-known works that was not connected to his best-known creation, Alvin and the Chipmunks. Bagdasarian, as David Seville, went on to much fame with his Chipmunks recordings."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"Everyday Is Like Sunday\" is the third track of Morrissey's debut solo album, Viva Hate, and the second single to be released by the artist. It made number nine in the UK Singles Chart and remains one of his best-known songs. \"Everyday Is Like Sunday\", as well as the single's B-sides \"Disappointed\" and \"Will Never Marry\", feature on the compilation album Bona Drag. The lyrics are inspired by Nevil Shute's novel On the Beach, about a group of people waiting for nuclear devastation in Melbourne, Australia.[citation needed] The track has been covered by a number of other bands, including The Pretenders (on the Original Motion Picture soundtrack Boys on the Side), by 10,000 Maniacs (as a B-side to their single \"Candy Everybody Wants\"), the Armageddon Dildos (on their \"Come Armageddon\" maxi-single), Estonian 1990s pop group Mr. Lawrence and Mikel Erentxun (on his album Acrobatas). Colin Meloy of The Decemberists also covers the track on his solo album Colin Meloy Sings Morrissey. Dave Couse (former lead singer of A House) has performed this live with his later band The Impossible and alternative rock band Fate or Trouble who released the song as their debut single. A mostly instrumental version (containing only the title lyric) was used in NFL Network's \"When all you want is football\" television ad campaign. The single was re-issued on 27 September 2010, on CD and two 7\"s, including the unreleased \"November the Second\"; an alternative mix of \"November Spawned a Monster\". This re-issue debuted at number 42 on the UK Singles Chart. It coincides with the 20th anniversary re-issue of his 1990 compilation, Bona Drag."@en ;

dbr:Irreplaceable	rdf:type	dbo:MusicalWork ;
	dbo:abstract	"\"Irreplaceable\" is a song recorded by American singer Beyonc\u00E9 for her second studio album, B'Day (2006). The song was written by Shaffer \"Ne-Yo\" Smith, Tor Erik Hermansen, Mikkel, S. Eriksen, Espen Lind, Amund Bj\u00F8rklund, Beyonc\u00E9 and produced by Stargate and Beyonc\u00E9. \"Irreplaceable\" was originally a country record; it was re-arranged as a mid-tempo ballad with pop and R&B influences by modifying the vocal arrangements and instrumentation. During the production and recording sessions, Beyonc\u00E9 and Ne-Yo wanted to create a record which people of either gender could relate to. The song's lyrics are about the breakdown of a relationship with an unfaithful man and the song contains a message about female empowerment. Following the moderate chart performances of \"D\u00E9j\u00E0 Vu\" and \"Ring the Alarm\", \"Irreplaceable\" was released internationally on October 23, 2006 as the album's second single, and the third in the United States on December 5, 2006. The single was released through Columbia Records. \"Irreplaceable\" was well received by contemporary music critics, who cited its distinct production compared with most songs featured on the album, and complimented its hook, \"To the left, to the left\". Pitchfork Media and Rolling Stone placed it on their lists of Best Songs of the 2000s. \"Irreplaceable\" won several awards, including Best R&B/Soul Single at the 2007 Soul Train Music Awards. It was nominated for the Record of the Year award at the 50th Grammy Awards. The single was commercially successful worldwide. It became Beyonc\u00E9's fourth number-one in the U.S., was B'Day's most successful release, and remained at the top of the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 chart for ten consecutive weeks. \"Irreplaceable\" was the best-selling U.S. single of 2007, the twenty-fifth most successful song of the 2000s (decade) in the U.S., and was certified double-platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). It became Beyonc\u00E9's second single to achieve 200 million audience impressions in 2006. She is the second singer to achieve this feat in the U.S., the first having been Mariah Carey in 2005. \"Irreplaceable\" peaked at number one in Australia, at number four in the United Kingdom, and reached the top twenty in several European countries. \"Irreplaceable\" was 2007's tenth best-selling digital single with over 4.6 million copies sold worldwide. The single's accompanying music video was directed by Anthony Mandler and served as the debut performance of Beyonc\u00E9's all-female band, Suga Mama. The video was included on the 2007 B'Day Anthology Video Album, and a video edit was produced for \"Irreemplazable\", the Spanish version of the song. It won the Video of the Year award at the 2007 Black Entertainment Television (BET) Awards, and was nominated for the MTV Video Music Award for Video of the Year at the 2007 Awards. \"Irreplaceable\" has regularly featured in Beyonc\u00E9's tours and live performances since 2006. The American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers (ASCAP) recognized the song as one of the most performed of 2007 at the ASCAP Pop Music Awards."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"It All Belongs to Me\" is a duet by American recording artists Monica and Brandy. Written and produced by Rico Love, Earl Hood, and Eric Goudy II, the track originally belonged to R. Kelly. He then gave the song to Monica and the label presented the song to Brandy, who expressed her wish to record a duet. After Clive Davis authorized it, they went to a recording studio located in Miami, Florida to record the track. Three different versions were made, with one being released as the official first single from Monica's seventh studio album New Life on February 10, 2012, through RCA Records. It is the first time Monica and Brandy worked together since they collaborated on \"The Boy Is Mine\" (1998). Musically, \"It All Belongs to Me\" is a midtempo R&B ballad . Lyrically, the song is a female empowerment anthem in which both singers claims their belongings as they leave their abusive boyfriends behind. The chorus has references to MacBook and Facebook. \"It All Belongs to Me\" also received several comparisons to Beyonc\u00E9 Knowles' single \"Irreplaceable\" (2006). Following the release of the single, Brandy revealed that she expected female listeners to love the song. \"It All Belongs to Me\" was well received by the public. However, it received mixed reviews from contemporary critics. Most critics praised both singers' vocal performance, but were disappointed with the track, commenting that the hype behind it was big, but also noting that the track wouldn't be as successful as \"The Boy Is Mine\". \"It All Belongs to Me\" has reached number 23 on Billboard's Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart. The accompanying music video was directed by Chris Robinson. It premiered on VH1 on March 5, 2012. The video was inspired by the films Thelma & Louise (1991) and Waiting to Exhale (1995), and portrays the singers in dysfunctional relationships and helping each other in both situations. Monica and Brandy promoted the song doing several performances, radio and television interviews. The singers were also going to perform the track on the Clive Davis' Pre-Grammy Party in 2012; however, the performance was cancelled following Whitney Houston's passing."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"Nobody\" is a song written by Kye Fleming and Dennis Morgan, and recorded by American country music artist Sylvia. It was released in June 1982 as the second single from the album Just Sylvia. The song was first recorded in 1982 by Sylvia, who was already a Country Music star the previous year, achieving a #1 hit and 2 other Top Tens in 1981. \"Nobody\" was her second and final #1 Country hit. The song was so successful, it crossed over to the Billboard Hot 100 charts, debuting on August 28, 1982 (the week the song dropped from #1 Country) and peaking at number fifteen. \"Nobody\" spent 20 weeks on the chart; earned a gold record; and was a Top Five Adult Contemporary hit. The song turned young Sylvia into a star on both sides of the charts. Although she gained Country Pop success with \"Nobody\", she never achieved another crossover hit, or for that matter, another #1 hit. The song became Sylvia's signature song and got her nominated her for a Grammy award in 1983 for Best Female Country Vocal Performance. It also helped her take home the Academy of Country Music (ACM) award for Top Female Vocalist of 1982, a category for which she was never even nominated by the Country Music Association (CMA)."@en ;

Additionally, CBS News' Bailey Johnson said that Crosson's version of the speech \"seems to perfectly capture the national mood,\" and Al Jazeera 's \"Listening Post\" stated that Crosson's satirical interpretation \"cuts through the usual diplomatic platitudes and delivers - what seems to be - a more honest ... account of what happened.\" CQ Roll Call Daily Briefing Editor David Hawkings remarked that the video \"skewered the president\u2019s 'no drama' affect and at the same time captured the mood of the country in the days after the Abbottobad raid.\""@en ;

The main riff in the song has been recognized as \"the riff that saved Black Sabbath\" because Tony Iommi, who wrote most of the band's music, was suffering from writer's block at the time. They resorted to drastic measures (including renting out the supposedly haunted Clearwell Castle to live in) to inspire him. The song has been dropped from Black Sabbath's sets. It was rarely played live in the 1970s, and when the band reunited they only performed the first half in completion, with Ozzy dropping out of the song and not singing the final two verses. By the year 2000, it was dropped from their set entirely, until it emerged a few years later when the band played the riff a few times as an introduction to \"Paranoid\".

While recording 18 Months, Harris expressed interest in working with Welch. He mentioned that it was not easy and he had to chase her, due to schedule conflicts. Welch accepted his invitation and the two recorded \"Sweet Nothing\". The track premiered on The Chris Moyles Show on BBC Radio 1 on 28 August 2012 and was later released as the fifth single from the album on 12 October 2012. \"Sweet Nothing\" is an electronic dance music song, with heartfelt vocals and an escalating beat. Lyrically, it talks about a romance with no depth, where the protagonist is receiving \"sweet nothing\". \"Sweet Nothing\" received favourable reviews, with many critics praising its production and Welch's vocals. The song debuted at number one on the UK Singles Chart, marking Harris' first number-one single as a main artist in the United Kingdom since his 2009 single, \"I'm Not Alone\". The song is also Welch's first top-ten hit in the United States, peaking at number 10. \"Sweet Nothing\" was nominated for Best Dance Recording at the 56th Grammy Awards.

	dbo:abstract	"\"That's the Way God Planned It\" is a song by American musician Billy Preston and the title track to his 1969 album of the same name. Issued as a single, the song was Preston's first release on the Beatles' Apple record label, following his guest role on the band's \"Get Back\" single. The lyrics to \"That's the Way God Planned It\" partly reflect the long musical apprenticeship Preston had served since childhood, mentored by artists such as Sam Cooke and Ray Charles, while musically the track combines the gospel tradition with rock. Produced by George Harrison in London, the recording also features contributions from Eric Clapton, Keith Richards, Ginger Baker and Doris Troy. Having been edited down to three minutes for its single release, the full version appeared on the album, as \"That's the Way God Planned It (Parts 1 & 2)\". \"That's the Way God Planned It\" became an international hit, peaking at number 11 on the UK Singles Chart, and is one of Preston's best-known songs. Backed again by Harrison and Clapton, Preston sung it at the Concert for Bangladesh in August 1971 \u2013 a high-spirited performance that several commentators regard as a highlight of that historic show, after its inclusion in the 1972 concert film. The single then charted for a second time on the Billboard Hot 100 when reissued by Apple in the United States. An early recording of the song, also from Preston's 1969 sessions in London, was included as a bonus track on the 1991 and 2010 remastered That's the Way God Planned It album. The 2002 reissue of Preston's Live European Tour album added a live version of \"That's the Way God Planned It\", recorded during the Rolling Stones' 1973 European tour."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"Then You Look at Me\" is a theme song from the movie Bicentennial Man. It was supposed to be released as the second single from Celine Dion's album All the Way... A Decade of Song, on December 11, 1999. \"Then You Look at Me\" was written by James Horner and Will Jennings, who wrote for Dion her 1997 hit \"My Heart Will Go On\". The Bicentennial Man film, released on December 13, 1999, and starring Robin Williams, became a flop and the single was cancelled. The second reason was that \"That's the Way It Is\" became a hit and was still strong on the singles charts around the world. However, \"Then You Look at Me\" was included as a B-side to the \"Live (for the One I Love)\", The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face\" and \"I Want You to Need Me\" singles. The movie soundtrack also included the song but in a slightly modified version, produced by James Horner and Simon Franglen. The version from Dion's album was produced by David Foster, Horner and Franglen and differs in arrangements and in Dion's interpretation. The \"Then You Look at Me\" music video, featuring Dion in a futuristic outfit and set in a robot research facility with clips of the film playing on screens in the background, was directed by Bille Woodruff and released at the end of 1999. It was included on Dion's All the Way... A Decade of Song & Video DVD in 2001."@en ;

The Elusive Chanteuse (2014), and features rapper Wale. The track was released on June 30, 2014, as the fourth single from the album. It was written by Wale, Carey, Jermaine Dupri and Bryan-Michael Cox, with production helmed by the latter three. The song contains an interpolation of \"I'm Caught Up in a One Night Affair\" written by Patrick Adams and Terri Gonzalez, both of whom received songwriting credits as a result. The single's artwork caused controversy when the media criticised Carey for photoshopping and re-using images of herself. A disco revival song, the lyrics are about Carey being dissatisfied by her lover's failed attempts at romancing her. Despite being serviced to urban and rhythmic radio in the United States, Belgium and South Korea were the only territories where the song charted, peaking at number 14 on its Ultratip chart, which ranks the top songs that have yet to enter the main Ultratop 50 chart, and number 2 on the South Korea download chart. \"You Don't Know What to Do\" garnered critical acclaim amongst music critics: many complimented the disco revival and throwback style, calling it the best track on the album, and compared it to the works of Jocelyn Brown, Daft Punk, Chic and post-revivalist songs produced Pharrell Williams. Carey and Wale performed the song for the first and only time on the Today show in the United States."@en ;

dbr:Check_on_It	rdf:type	dbo:MusicalWork ;
	dbo:abstract	"\"Check on It\" is a song recorded by American singer Beyonc\u00E9, featuring American rappers Bun B and Slim Thug. It was composed by Beyonc\u00E9, Swizz Beatz, Sean Garrett, Angela Beyinc\u00E9 and Slim Thug. Initially recorded by Beyonc\u00E9 only, the song was supposed to be featured on the soundtrack album for 2006 film The Pink Panther, in which she co-stars. As it was ultimately not included on its soundtrack album, the song with additional vocals from Slim Thug was placed on the 2005 Destiny's Child's greatest hits album #1's. Columbia Records released \"Check on It\" in the United States on December 13, 2005. The official single version of the song includes vocals from American rapper Bun B. The song's development was motivated by the phrase 'Check on It' which Beyonc\u00E9 and her management jokingly used before they decided to turn it into a song. \"Check on It\" is an R&B and hip hop song, which is instrumentally complete with a heavy bassline, strings, and wind instrument. Lyrically, it takes place in a club, where Beyonc\u00E9 is letting the male patrons know that they are welcome to come and look at her sexually attractive body when she is dancing. The song consists of two verse-raps by Slim Thug. \"Check on It\" was well received by contemporary music critics, who universally complimented Beyonc\u00E9's vocals, and the assertiveness with which she sings her lines. \"Check on It\" was not originally lined up for a release as a single from the album #1's. However, it received heavy rotation on US radio stations, following the release of the first single, \"Stand Up for Love\" (2005), which performed poorly on the charts. Eventually, \"Check on It\" debuted on the US Billboard Hot 100 in November 2005, before its official release date. The single peaked at number one for five consecutive weeks, becoming one of the two longest-running number-one single in 2006, and Beyonc\u00E9's third US number-one single as a solo artist. \"Check on It\" reached number one in New Zealand and the top ten on various singles chart in mainland Europe. The music video for the song was directed by Hype Williams, and premiered on December 16, 2005 on MTV. The version of \"Check on It\" used in the clip features a remix of \"The Pink Panther Theme\" and a verse-rap from American rapper Bun B. Incorporating 1950s influences, the video was shot in pink to brand the relationship with The Pink Panther. It won the Best R&B Video at the 2006 MTV Video Music Awards, and was nominated for Video of the Year at the 2006 BET Awards. Although Beyonc\u00E9 did not perform \"Check on It\" in any televised appearances, it was a part of her set list on The Beyonc\u00E9 Experience (2007) and the I Am... Tour (2009\u201310)."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"City of Blinding Lights\" is a song by the rock band U2. It is the fifth track on their 2004 album How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb and was released as the album's fourth single on 6 June 2005. The song was a top ten hit in Ireland, the United Kingdom, and several other countries. The music video was shot in Vancouver, British Columbia. The earliest incarnation of the song was developed during sessions for the band's 1997 album Pop. The lyrics were partially inspired by lead singer Bono's recollection of his first trip to London, and by the band's experience of playing New York City in the aftermath of the September 11 attacks. Other lyrics refer to Bono's relationship with his wife. The song's underlying theme reflects lost innocence and was inspired by an image Bono saw of himself from the early 1980s. The sound has been compared to the tone of U2's 1984 album The Unforgettable Fire and their 1987 single \"Where the Streets Have No Name.\" \"City of Blinding Lights\" was well received by critics and won a Grammy Award for Best Rock Song at the 2006 ceremony. The song made its live debut on the group's 2005 Vertigo Tour, when it was commonly played as the opening song, and it has been performed at every show from a U2 concert tour since. The track has been used in episodes of The Simpsons and Entourage, and in the film The Devil Wears Prada. President Barack Obama used it at campaign events during the 2008 and 2012 U.S. presidential elections, and listed it as one of his favourite songs; U2 performed it at his inaugural celebration."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"You'll See\" is a song by American recording artist Madonna from her ballads compilation Something to Remember (1995). The album was released with the intention of toning down the image of Madonna, who was being heavily criticized at the time. The singer decided to work with producer David Foster, who co-wrote and produced three songs with Madonna in September 1995. \"You'll See\" was released on October 30, 1995, by Maverick Records as the lead single from the album. An acoustic pop ballad, \"You'll See\" features instrumentation from percussion, tremolo guitar and piano, while lyrically it speaks of independence after end of a love affair. The song received positive reception from contemporary critics, with reviewers praising Madonna's vocals. The American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers (ASCAP) honored it as the Most Performed Song, in their annual ASCAP Pop Awards for 1997. \"You'll See\" was commercially successful, reaching the top five in Austria, Canada, Finland, Italy and the United Kingdom. The single also managed to peak at number six on the US Billboard Hot 100 making it Madonna's 29th top-ten single on the chart. An accompanying music video was directed by Michael Haussman, whose story line was a sequel to Madonna's previous music video for \"Take a Bow\". An alternate Spanish version, written by Argentine singer-songwriter Paz Martinez, also received a music video, and was included on the Latin American edition of Something to Remember. Madonna has performed the song live on the British television program Top of the Pops and on selected US shows of her 2001 Drowned World Tour. On 2009, Scottish singer Susan Boyle included a cover of the song on her debut studio album I Dreamed a Dream."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"U Should've Known Better\" is a song by American recording artist Monica. It was written in collaboration with Harold Lilly and Jermaine Dupri, and produced by the latter along with frequent co-producer Bryan Michael Cox for her original third studio album, All Eyez on Me (2002). When the album was shelved for release outside Japan, the song was one out of five original records that were transferred into its new version, After the Storm (2003). A contemporary R&B slow jam, \"U Should've Known Better\" contains elements of soul music and rock music. Built on an pulsating backbeat, the song's instrumentation consists of screeching guitars and an understated harp pattern. Lyrically, Monica, as the protagonist, delivers a message of loyalty to her imprisoned love interest and sings about staying down for him despite his doubts. The song was generally well received by contemporary music critics who highlighted the heartfelt emotion and sadness. Released as the fourth and final single from After the Storm in May 2004, the single marked Monica's first balladic release in over five years. On the charts, \"U Should've Known Better\" peaked at number 19 on the US Billboard Hot 100 and number 6 on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Singles & Tracks, becoming the album's highest-charting single release after \"So Gone\".

Jeff Lynne of Electric Light Orchestra, who had worked with Harrison on Harrison's album Cloud Nine and as part of the Traveling Wilburys, was asked to co-produce the record. The music video for \"Free as a Bird\" was produced by Vincent Joliet and directed by Joe Pytka; from the point of view of a bird in flight, it depicts many references to Beatles songs, such as \"Strawberry Fields Forever,\" \"Penny Lane\", \"Paperback Writer\", \"A Day in the Life\", \"Eleanor Rigby\", \"Revolution\", and \"Helter Skelter\". \"Free as a Bird\" won the 1997 Grammy Award for Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal and was The Beatles' 34th Top 10 single in the United States.

	dbo:abstract	"\"All I Want for Christmas Is You\" is a song performed by American singer and songwriter Mariah Carey, and written and produced by Carey and Walter Afanasieff. It was released by Columbia Records on November 1, 1994 as the lead single from her first holiday album and fourth studio album, Merry Christmas. \"Christmas\" is an uptempo love song that includes bell chimes and heavy back-up vocals, as well as use of synthesizers. The song's lyrics declare that the narrator does not care about Christmas presents or lights; all she wants for Christmas is to be with her lover. Two music videos were commissioned for the song: the song's primary music video features grainy home-movie-style footage of Carey, her dogs and family during the holiday season, as well as Carey dressed in a Santa suit frolicking on a snowy mountainside. Carey's then-husband Tommy Mottola makes a cameo appearance as Santa Claus, bringing Carey a gift and leaving on a red sleigh. The second video was filmed in black and white format, and features Carey dressed in 1960s style in homage to The Ronettes, alongside back up singers and female dancers. Carey has performed \"All I Want for Christmas Is You\" in a slew of live television appearances and tours throughout her career. In 2010, Carey re-recorded the song for her second holiday album, Merry Christmas II You, titled \"All I Want for Christmas Is You (Extra Festive)\". Carey also re-recorded the song as a duet with Canadian singer Justin Bieber for his 2011 album Under the Mistletoe, titled \"All I Want for Christmas for You (SuperFestive!)\". The song has also been covered by many artists over the years. In the years since its original release, \"All I Want for Christmas Is You\" has been critically lauded and has become established as a Christmas standard; it was once called \"one of the few worthy modern additions to the holiday canon\" in The New Yorker, and continues to surge in popularity each holiday season. The song was commercially successful, reaching the number-two position on the singles charts of Australia, Japan, the Netherlands, Norway, and the United Kingdom, and the top 10 in several other countries. The Daily Telegraph hailed \"All I Want for Christmas Is You\" as the most popular and most played Christmas song of the decade in the United Kingdom. Rolling Stone ranked it fourth on its Greatest Rock and Roll Christmas Songs list, calling it a \"holiday standard.\" In December 2015, the song peaked at 11 on the Billboard Hot 100, making it its highest peak since its original release. With global sales of over 14 million copies, the song remains Carey's biggest international success and the 11th best-selling single of all time. As of 2013, the song was reported to have earned $50 million in royalties."@en ;

It was inducted into the Music Video Producers Hall of Fame. The single, along with its music video, propelled Thriller into becoming the best-selling album of all time.

The song was also ranked number 81 on Rolling Stone's \"100 Greatest Guitar Songs of All Time\".

	dbo:abstract	"\"Burning Heart\" is a song by Survivor. It was performed by Jimi Jamison and appeared in the 1985 film Rocky IV and on its soundtrack album. The single peaked at number 2 on the Billboard Hot 100 for two weeks in February 1986, behind \"That's What Friends Are For\" by Dionne and Friends. \"Burning Heart\", which is about an \"all or nothing\" battle, was inspired by the Cold War, as shown by lyrics such as \"Is it East versus West?\" and \"Can any nation stand alone?\" The Communist East versus Capitalist West conflict is reflected in the film by the fight in the boxing ring between Rocky and Ivan Drago. The final solo and tremolo bar solos in the middle of the song were played with a Fender Stratocaster. The song was used on the final episode of HBO's 24/7 documentary on the 2011 NHL Winter Classic. The song was used to describe the hype and East vs. West feel surrounding the Washington Capitals' Russian superstar Alexander Ovechkin, and the Pittsburgh Penguins' Canadian superstar Sidney Crosby, who were the focus of attention heading into the Winter Classic."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"Change Your Life\" is a song recorded by British girl group Little Mix for their debut studio album, DNA (2012). It was written by Richard \"Biff\" Stannard, Tim Powell, Ash Howes and Little Mix, while its production was handled by Stannard and Powell. \"Change Your Life\" was written while the group were on The X Factor Tour and it was the first song composed for the album. It was written based on the group's experience on The X Factor and their fans. Syco serviced the song, the third single from DNA, to radio stations in the United Kingdom on 5 January 2013. It was released for digital download on 15 February 2013. The song has themes of girl power, perseverance and self-empowerment. A mid-tempo pop power ballad, \"Change Your Life\" exhibits the influence of soul and urban contemporary music. Instrumentation includes tumbling R&B piano lines and a pulsating, driving backbeat. The contemporary sound provided by its instrumentation has similarities to several songs produced by Coldplay and Ryan Tedder. \"Change Your Life\" attracted mixed to positive reviews from critics, most of whom considered it a highlight on DNA, commending the group's harmonies and the song's inspirational lyrics. Some reviewers, however, felt that it was weak and poor alternative to the album's lead single, \"Wings\" (2012). \"Change Your Life\" reached number 12 in Ireland and the United Kingdom, becoming Little Mix's fourth consecutive top 20 hit in both countries. It also became their second top ten hit in Australia, peaking at number 8. \"Change Your Life\" was certified platinum by the Australian Recording Industry Association. The accompanying music video was released on 31 January 2013. Filmed backstage at the group's DNA Tour and on their tour bus, it shows the group bonding with each other. Met with mixed reviews, critics likened it to Spice Girls' 1997 music video, \"Mama\". Little Mix have performed \"Change Your Life\" on television shows Dancing on Ice, The Graham Norton Show and This Morning and during their DNA Tour (2013)."@en ;
