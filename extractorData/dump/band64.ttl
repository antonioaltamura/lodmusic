They combine Indian raga style composition with Appalachian folk and post-psychedelic electrical experimentalism. They use Western and Eastern acoustic instruments amplified and augmented with effects such as reverb, delay, and flange.

	dbo:abstract	"Neck is a six-piece London-Irish Celtic punk band from the North London neighbourhood of 'County Holloway' (known informally thus due to its Irish population). Following Leeson O'Keeffe's cathartic 'Tour of Duty' as a former member of Shane MacGowan and the Popes, Neck were formed during late-night drinking sessions (known colloquially as being 'born in a bottle') in 1994 by a mixture of Irish emigrant and second-generation Irish drinking buddies. The band takes their lead, both musically and ideologically, from two other London bands: The Clash and The Pogues, blending the electric energy of punk rock with the swirl of traditional Irish music, to play a London-Irish style known as 'Psycho-Ceil\u00EDdh'. Initially playing exclusively on the London Irish bar circuit, apparently mainly for more hedonistic reasons, and with a correspondingly 'cavalier' attitude towards required band possessions, their name was serendipitously gleaned from the reaction to their approach by the exasperated landlord at their first ever gig, cursing them with an old Irish saying using the term \"neck\" \u2013 implying high levels of nerve or impudence. They appear to have branched-out considerably, both aspirationally and geographically, since then: touring extensively throughout the United States, Europe, UK and Ireland; gaining a reputation as a raucous, high-energy live act, leading to them becoming an established festival band. Such festivals include: Tantsy festival in Moscow Hermitage Garden; Dublin Irish Festival, Ohio \u2013 the second-largest Irish festival in the United States; Paas Pop in The Netherlands; The West Belfast F\u00E9ile an Phobail; Berlin's Punk & Disorderly festival four times; the UK's largest festival, Glastonbury festival, six times; and the UK's Wasted/Rebellion Punk festival ten times. Their music is known for having an uplifting quality, and it reflects the life experience of the emigrant and second-generation Irish diaspora, with O'Keeffe's authentic voice and song-and-tune-writing being considered both faithful to the form, and in direct lineage from his former band-leader and mentor, Shane MacGowan. Combined with deft musicianship, Neck have released four albums to date, with their third album, 'Sod 'em & begorrah!' being picked out for particularly high praise by being judged, variously, the second and third greatest Celtic punk album of all time, the former above, and the latter behind only The Pogues and Flogging Molly. They've also appeared on numerous compilation albums, and their natural London inclusiveness and punk sensibilities came well to the fore on their Joe Strummer (of The Clash) -inspired anti-racism anthem \"Everybody's Welcome to The Hooley!\", which charted in the UK Singles Chart and UK Indie Chart in 2006. Their music can also be heard on various motion picture soundtracks: on the \"surreal\" Pirates of the White Sand short (2005); The Emerald Diamond, a 2006 documentary film about the Irish National Baseball Team - contributing four songs, including the traditional \"Star of the County Down\" and the original \"Every Day's Saint Patrick's Day\"; the Boston-set Gang War Shoot-'em Up Beantown (2007); and the \"Capraesque\" homage to 'Small Town America Coming of Age' Supermarket (2009). They also appear performing two songs, the traditional \"Carrickfergus\" and the original \"The Ferry Fare\", in the 1999, Belfast-set, Film 4 Romantic Comedy Drama With or Without You, directed by Michael Winterbottom (Family / Welcome to Sarajevo / 24 Hour Party People). With over half their members drawn from the renowned London Irish traditional music session scene, their authentic, spirited musicianship has earned them much respect and admiration. Staying true to those roots, they often perform acoustic 'Unplugged / Irish traditional music session' sets, even alongside full electric ones, and such is their flair, energy and passion - exemplified by O'Keeffe's 'wearing his heart on his sleeve', that they were awarded the honour by the Irish Cultural Centre in London to perform such a Seisi\u00FAn at the Reception for the Irish Paralympic team in London 2012, in order to set the right Irish tone and ambience to the proceedings. This reputation has led to various members being invited to appear both live and on other band's recordings. The most well known is O'Keeffe guesting, on banjo, with the Alabama 3, as well as co-writing an original song \"That's It, I Quit\" on the Hayseed Dixie album No Covers. This has all led to them being recognised widely as one of the leading bands on the international Celtic punk and folk punk scenes, alongside their US contemporaries Dropkick Murphys and Flogging Molly, and such is their influence that not only is the Boston, Massachusetts-based website covering the Celtic punk scene, Shite 'n' Onions, named after one of their tunes, but bands as far flung as in Germany and the United States now cover their songs, while O'Keeffe gets name-checked in songs by other bands."@en ;

Their debut single \"Heaven and Earth\" was withdrawn from the chart because the single contained a track whose length was longer than permitted for that format. Following singles were \"Can't Say Goodbye\" and \"Serious\". A fourth single, \"Xanadu\" (a cover of the Olivia Newton-John and Electric Light Orchestra song), was due to be released but was cancelled when the group split. They had also recorded songs for a planned studio album.Their single \"Heaven and Earth\" was licensed for use in Dancing Stage Fusion by Konami in 2005."@en ;

The four-piece band consisted of then-former Soundgarden lead singer/rhythm guitarist Chris Cornell, and then-former Rage Against the Machine members Tom Morello (lead guitar), Tim Commerford (bass/backing vocals), and Brad Wilk (drums). Critics first described Audioslave as a combination of Soundgarden and Rage Against the Machine, but by the band's second album, Out of Exile, it was noted that they had established a separate identity. Audioslave's trademark sound was created by blending 1970s hard rock with 1990s alternative rock. Moreover, Morello incorporated his well-known, unconventional guitar solos into the mix. As with Rage Against the Machine, the band prided themselves on the fact that all sounds on their albums were produced using only guitar, bass, drums, and vocals. In its six years of existence, Audioslave released three albums, received three Grammy nominations, and became the first American rock band to perform an open-air concert in Cuba. Audioslave disbanded in February 2007 when Cornell issued a statement announcing that he was permanently leaving the band \"due to irresolvable personality conflicts as well as musical differences.\" The 2007 Rage Against the Machine reunion and tour involving the rest of the band as well as solo albums released that same year by Morello and Cornell cemented the supergroup's permanent demise."@en ;

Their hometown is what gave name to the band. Since 1996, they were joined by percussionist Papo Rom\u00E1n, who left the band in 2006 to dedicate time to his family. The band rose to prominence with their eponymous debut album, which was released in 1996. The album was a hit, spawning several hit singles like \"Salimos de Aqu\u00ED\" and \"El Wanab\u00ED\", and turning the band into one of the most popular musical groups in the island at the moment. Fiel a la Vega followed their debut album with four more studio albums, three of which were released independently. Despite not having the support of a multinational record label or wide publicity, after 20 years, the band is still considered by many as \"the most important rock band in the history of Puerto Rico\". In recent years, the band has seen little activity, with its members being involved in personal projects. Singer Auger has been touring the island solo, and with a musician troupe called La Banda Ac\u00FAstica Rodante, while guitarist Laureano has been pursuing a solo career, while also touring the island with fellow guitarist Joel Rodr\u00EDguez. Brothers Pedro and Jorge continue to work as a professor and chef respectively, while also working on their own band, Los Arraiza Voladores."@en ;

The band's first five albums sold more than 10 million copies worldwide. The quintet is perhaps best known for the power ballad \"Sister Christian\", which peaked at No. 5 in June 1984. After their success waned in the late 1980s, the band split up in 1989 and its members pursued other musical endeavours including group and solo efforts. Brad Gillis and Kelly Keagy teamed up with bassist Gary Moon and released an album without the other original band members in 1995, but the band soon re-united to release two new albums in the latter half of the decade. Despite the departure of original keyboardist Alan Fitzgerald and guitarist Jeff Watson, the band has continued to tour and remains very popular in Asian countries, particularly Japan."@en ;

Their stage show used an extensive array of props and costumes such as bales of hay, stuffed roosters, rubber trout, and wads of self printed 'country currency'. Yet though the band was tongue-in-cheek, their presage of another Great Depression - 22 years before the fact - was very much by design. The band was only in existence for six months, but they are noteworthy for their ever changing lineup of musicians and performers which included Chris Cornell with Soundgarden, Jonathan Poneman, founder of Sub Pop Records, and Ben McMillan, lead singer for Skin Yard and Gruntruck."@en ;

The group was founded in 1989 by keyboard player Per Holm, disc jockey J\u00F8rn K (J\u00F8rn Kristensen), and rapper MC Zipp (Jens Kj\u00E6r Larsen). In December 1990 singer Thera Hoeymans joined the group. Their debut single \"Take No Crap\" featured vocals by Danish singer Christine Christiansen and was released in 1990. The following year the single was released as \"Get Serious\" internationally. The song became a moderate hit on the Billboard Hot 100, but a top 10 hit on the dance chart. Their debut album, Get Serious was released on Epic Records in 1991, which was a moderate success in dance clubs in Europe. The album sold 53.000 copies in Denmark, with an additional 200.000 copies worldwide. In 1992, the group was awarded three Danish Grammy Awards for Danish Newcomer of the Year, Danish Hit of the Year (\"Get Serious\"), and Danish Rap/Dance Album of the Year (Get Serious). For their second album, Peace, Love & Harmony (1993) Danish-American singer Zindy Laursen joined the group. On the album Zindy provided lead vocals on four tracks, while Thera Hoeymans sang lead vocals on two tracks. Their cover of the KC & the Sunshine Band song \"Give it Up\" went to No. 1 in Australia for 4 weeks in 1994. The track reached No. 61 in the UK Singles Chart. In March 1994, Thera Hoeymans left the group to pursue a career as an actor in theatre. Cut 'N' Move released their third and final studio album, The Sound of Now in 1995. They scored a minor hit in the U.S. with lead single \"I'm Alive\", which went to No. 46 on the Hot Dance Club Play chart. The song reached No. 49 in the UK chart. In 1996 Cut 'N' Move released the greatest hits album, Into the Zone '91-'96 which included three new songs. The album was awarded Danish Dance Album of the Year at the Danish Grammy Awards. The following year the group disbanded. In a retrospective article in 2009, Politiken called Cut 'N' Move \"a kind of big sister to the 90's biggest Danish hit group Aqua\" and wrote: \"18 years later the band still stands as a milestone in Danish music. Cut 'N' Move was simply the band that brought dance music to the country\"."@en ;

Formed in Ripley, Oklahoma in the early 1920s, the band was first known as McGinty's Oklahoma Cowboy Band, for the leader, Billy McGinty, a well-known cowboy, former Rough Rider, and world champion rider with Buffalo Bill's show. The band members were authentic cowboys from ranches in and around Ripley. Their first promoter, George Youngblood, introduced them saying, \"I wish to say of this bunch of cowboys that they are not only good fiddlers, but can ride or rope anything that has horns, hide or hair.\" After McGinty left to become the postmaster of Ripley, Otto Gray (1884\u20131967), took over as bandleader as well as manager. With the extensive traveling generated from their popularity, the original band members dropped out to stay with their jobs and families. Gray filled their places with professional musicians willing to spend most of their time on the road. Playing on the vaudeville circuits in the Midwest and Northeast, and nationwide over some 130 radio stations, they played the first cowboy music most Americans outside of the West had ever heard. One of their most popular tunes was \"Midnight Special\", performed by member Dave \"Pistol Pete\" Cutrell; Cutrell's \"Pistol Pete's Midnight Special\" with McGinty's band was also the first version of \"Midnight Special\" ever recorded. The band lasted until the early 1930s when economic situations led them to disband."@en ;

In 2000 the band recorded a gangsta rap album, Porch Life, and distributed it unofficially via cassette tape. In 2003 the album was officially released on CD through Fork in Hand. They have also recorded splits with Melt-Banana, Brain Failure, and Drexel. Big D and the Kids Table have played 200 shows a year, on average, in support of bands including The Mighty Mighty Bosstones, Dropkick Murphys, Rancid, and Alexisonfire, and have become regular performers on the Warped Tour.

Former members Matt Tong and Gordon Moakes left the band in 2013 and 2015 respectively. Their brand of music, whilst rooted in rock, retains elements of other genres such as electronica and house music. The band was formed at the 1999 Reading Festival by Okereke and Lissack. They went through a variety of names before settling on Bloc Party in 2003. Moakes joined the band after answering an advert in NME magazine, while Tong was picked via an audition. Bloc Party got their break by giving BBC Radio 1 DJ Steve Lamacq and Franz Ferdinand's lead singer, Alex Kapranos, a copy of their demo \"She's Hearing Voices\". In February 2005, the band released their debut album Silent Alarm. It was critically acclaimed and was named Indie Album of the Year at the 2006 PLUG Awards and NME Album of the year which both honour indie music. That year, the record was also certified platinum in Britain. The band built on this success in 2007 with the release of their second studio album, A Weekend in the City, which reached a peak of number two in the UK Albums Chart and number twelve in the Billboard 200. In August 2008, Bloc Party released their third studio record, Intimacy which entered the UK Albums Chart at number eight and number eighteen on the Billboard 200. The band went on a hiatus in October 2009 to focus on side projects. They reunited in September 2011, and shortly thereafter released their fourth album, Four, which entered the UK Albums Chart at number three. In 2013, Bloc Party released their third EP titled The Nextwave Sessions in August; the band then began an indefinite hiatus to continue with their respective side projects. The band's fifth studio album, Hymns, the first to involve Harris and Bartle, was released on 29 January 2016. Bloc Party have sold over 3 million albums worldwide."@en ;

Consisting of singer John McCrea, trumpeter Vince DiFiore, guitarist Xan McCurdy, bassist Gabe Nelson and drummer Paulo Baldi, the band has been noted for McCrea's sarcastic lyrics and monotone vocals, DiFiore's trumpet parts, and their wide-ranging musical influences, including country music, Mariachi, rock, funk, Iranian folk music and hip hop. Cake was formed in 1991 by McCrea, DiFiore, Greg Brown, Frank French and Shon Meckfessel, who soon left and was replaced by Nelson. Following the self-release of its debut album, Motorcade of Generosity, the band was signed to Capricorn Records in 1995 and released its first single, \"Rock 'n' Roll Lifestyle\", which hit number 35 on the Modern Rock Tracks music chart and was featured on MTV's 120 Minutes; French and Nelson then left the band, and were replaced by Todd Roper and Victor Damiani. Cake's second album, 1996's Fashion Nugget, went platinum on the strength of its lead single, \"The Distance\". Following a tour of Europe and the United States, both Brown and Damiani announced they were leaving Cake, which led to speculation about the band's future; McCrea eventually recruited Xan McCurdy to take over on guitar, and persuaded Nelson to return. Prolonging the Magic, the band's third album, was released in 1998 and went platinum, having shipped over one million units; this was followed three years later by Comfort Eagle, the band's first album on Columbia Records, featuring the single \"Short Skirt/Long Jacket\" which hit number 7 on the Modern Rock Tracks chart. Following a series of tours, including several versions of the Unlimited Sunshine Tour, the band released Pressure Chief in 2004, its second and last album on Columbia. After creating its own label, Upbeat Records, the band released Showroom of Compassion in 2011, which became its first album to debut at the top of the Billboard charts, selling 44,000 copies in the first week after release."@en ;

Benny did meet John and Ian when they were playing with Glenn Hughes and Benny's previous band Fortune (music group from Sweden) opened for Glenn Hughes on his Japan tour in 1994, and guitar player Jan Granwick(Glory) have Benny known for years so he was also asked to participate. Benny felt that he wanted to make an album with all the elements that he thought a good album should have, nice melody and good musician ship. Not just jump onto the next music scene that appears 'cause it has changed. Together with Christer Wedin at Empire Records they set plans for this project.The debut album \" Nostalgia \" is an album filled with strong melodies, tasteful arrangements, good musician ship and great sound, the later created by Ronny Lahti (Europe, Talisman, Saigon Kick), is incredible. 1999. After the successful release of Clockwise debut album \"Nostalgia\", which received rave reviews all over the world, the second album called \"Na\u00EFve\", was released. And again, Benny S\u00F6derberg asked his musician friends, who participated on the first album, to record this follow up album. Therefore, you will again find, John Lev\u00E9n bass and Ian Haugland drums from Europe, as the solid rhythm section. Contractual reason made it impossible for guitar player Jan Granwick to participate on this second record. Therefore, the guitar axe man Fredrik \u00C5kesson (Talisman, Arch Enemy, Southpaw now with Opeth) was asked to play with Clockwise on this record and so he did. Songs that catch strong melody and brilliant musical performance are Clockwise trademark, and the second album \"Naive\" is filled with this. Benny S\u00F6derberg has again written all the material, and no one will mistake his feeling for writing songs with his special harmony and feeling. Benny has also recorded a demo for Clockwise 3rd album, (maybe) to be named \"nothing is the greatest thing\". On this demo Benny plays all instruments, except bass, which is played by John Lev\u00E9n, and for this demo Jan Granwick plays all guitars. The songs featured on this demo are \"Our Roads Never Cross\", \"If You Change Your Mind\" and \"Demon In The Dim\". You can also expect the ending for the song \"the tales of King Solitude\" that started with part 1:3 on the first album, continued with \"the tales of King Solitude 2:3\" on the second album, and now to be ended with \"the tales of King Solitude 3:3\" on the 3rd album."@en ;

Since 1992, the band has consisted of Joe Elliott (lead vocals), Rick Savage (bassist, backing vocals), Rick Allen (drums, backing vocals), Phil Collen (guitar, backing vocals), and Vivian Campbell (guitar, backing vocals). This is the band's longest-standing line-up. The band's strongest commercial success came between the early 1980s and the early 1990s. Their 1981 album, High 'n' Dry, was produced by Robert John \"Mutt\" Lange, who helped them begin to define their style, and the album's standout track \"Bringin' On the Heartbreak\" became one of the first rock videos played on MTV in 1982. The band's next studio album, Pyromania in January 1983, with \"Photograph\" as the lead single, turned Def Leppard into a household name. In the U.S., Pyromania was certified Diamond (10\u00D7 Platinum). In 2003, the album ranked number 384 on Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time. Def Leppard's fourth album Hysteria, released in August 1987, topped the UK and U.S. album charts. As of 2009, it has reached beyond the success of Pyromania, having been certified 12\u00D7 Platinum for sales of over 12 million in the U.S. and has gone on to sell over 25 million copies worldwide. The album spawned seven hit singles, including the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 number one \"Love Bites\", alongside \"Pour Some Sugar on Me\", \"Hysteria\", \"Armageddon It\", \"Animal\", \"Rocket\", and \"Women\". Their next studio album, Adrenalize (the first following the death of guitarist Steve Clark), reached number one in the UK and U.S. charts in 1992, and contained several hits, including \"Let's Get Rocked\" and \"Have You Ever Needed Someone So Bad\". Their 1993 album, Retro Active, contained the acoustic hit song \"Two Steps Behind\", while their greatest-hits album Vault, released in 1995, featured the UK hit \"When Love & Hate Collide\". As one of the world's best-selling music artists, Def Leppard have sold more than 100 million records worldwide, and have two albums with RIAA Diamond certification, Pyromania and Hysteria. They are one of only five rock bands with two original studio albums selling over 10 million copies in the U.S. The band were ranked No. 31 in VH1's \"100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock\" and ranked No. 70 in \"100 Greatest Artists of All Time\"."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Enigma is a German musical project founded in 1990 by Romanian-German musician and producer Michael Cretu. Cretu had released several solo records, collaborated with various artists, and produced albums for his then wife, German pop singer Sandra, before he conceived the idea of a New Age, Worldbeat project. He recorded the first Enigma studio album, MCMXC a.D. (1990), with contributions from David Fairstein and Frank Peterson. The album remains Enigma's biggest, helped by the international hit single, \"Sadeness (Part I)\", which sold 12 million units alone. According to Cretu, the inspiration for the creation of the project came from his desire to make a kind of music that did not obey \"the old rules and habits\" and presented a new form of artistic expression with mystic and experimental components. Enigma followed MCMXC a.D. with a series of albums that involved several musicians and producers working with Cretu. The first was The Cross of Changes (1993), which incorporated tribal and ethnic influences and sold over 8 million copies worldwide, followed by Le Roi est mort, vive le Roi! (1996), which blended together the Gregorian chants reminiscent from the first album and the strong intercultural soundscapes present in the second. Enigma's fourth album was The Screen Behind the Mirror, released in 2000, which started a slight departure from the previous world music themes towards a heavier electronic atmosphere. This evolution culminated with Voyageur, its fifth and more pop-based album, and 2006's A Posteriori, a work inspired by the future collision between the Milky Way and Andromeda galaxies, with distinct operatic tones and an electronic spectrum closer to Voyageur than the earlier releases. Seven Lives Many Faces, its seventh album, was released in 2008 and contained a mixture of classical and modern elements ranging from ethnic chants to rap and dubstep influences. Its eighth album, The Fall of a Rebel Angel, was announced for a November 2016 release. Enigma has sold over 70 million records worldwide, reached 60 number 1 songs at the charts around the world and achieved over 100 Gold and Platinum certificates. The project has also received 3 Grammy nominations and is one of the best-selling musical acts of all time."@en ;

During the band's career, they have released nine full-length albums and have evolved through a succession of styles, including nu metal, death metal, groove metal, and thrash metal. Fear Factory was enormously influential on the heavy metal scene in the mid-to-late 1990s. Fear Factory went on hold in March 2002 following some internal disputes, but reformed later that year without founding member Dino Cazares, adding bassist Byron Stroud, and previous bassist Christian Olde Wolbers as guitarist. In April 2009, a new lineup was announced. Cazares returned as lead and rhythm guitarist, and Gene Hoglan as drummer. Bell and Stroud reprised their respective roles, and the band completed a seventh studio album titled Mechanize. Former members Christian Olde Wolbers and Raymond Herrera\u2014both of whom were playing in Arkaea\u2014disputed the legitimacy of the new lineup, and a legal battle from both parties was begun. Fear Factory released its eighth studio album, The Industrialist, in June 2012. Their latest album, Genexus, was released in August 2015. Over the years, Fear Factory has seen changes in its members, with lead vocalist Burton C. Bell being the only consistent member since 1989. The band has performed at three Ozzfests and the inaugural Gigantour. Their singles have charted on the US Mainstream Rock Top 40 and albums on the Billboard Top 40, 100, and 200, and they have sold more than a million albums in the U.S. alone."@en ;

The band gained recognition in the United Kingdom after the EP's title track peaked at number 44 on UK Singles Chart. In January 2004, the band released the song \"Take Me Out\". The song went on to achieve global recognition, charting in several countries, and earned a Grammy nomination for Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal. It has since been noted as the band's signature song and has received critical acclaim from critics. The band subsequently released their eponymous debut studio album on 9 February 2004 to critical acclaim. The album won the 2004 Mercury Prize and earned a Grammy nomination for Best Alternative Album. In 2005, the band released their second studio album, You Could Have It So Much Better, which was produced by Rich Costey. The album went on to earn critical acclaim from critics as well as a positive commercial performance, peaking within the top-ten in multiple countries. The album earned a nomination for Best Alternative Album and one of the singles released from the album, \"Do You Want To\", earned a nomination for Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal at the 48th Annual Grammy Awards. The band's third studio album, Tonight: Franz Ferdinand, was announced in late 2008 and released in January 2009. The album was notable for featuring a change in the band's musical style, as the band had shifted from a post-punk-focused sound, which was featured on their first two albums, to a more dance-oriented sound. The album gained a positive commercial performance as well as positive reviews, but not as much acclaim as their first two albums. A remix album of Tonight, titled Blood, was subsequently released in July 2009. Four years after the release of Tonight, the band released their fourth studio album, Right Thoughts, Right Words, Right Action. In 2015, it was announced that Franz Ferdinand and American rock band Sparks had formed the supergroup FFS. The two released the album FFS in June 2015. In 2016, it was announced that Nick McCarthy had taken a break from the band to focus on family matters and other musical projects, but will be returning."@en ;

Influenced by early electronic and (post-)industrial acts such as Cabaret Voltaire, Portion Control, D.A.F., Test Dept, SPK, and Severed Heads, FLA has developed its own unique sound while combining elements of electronic body music (EBM). The band's membership has rotated through several members over the years, including Rhys Fulber and Michael Balch who are both associated with several other successful artists."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Idlewild are a Scottish indie rock band that formed in Edinburgh in 1995. The band's line-up consists of Roddy Woomble (lead vocals), Rod Jones (guitar, backing vocals), Colin Newton (drums), Andrew Mitchell (bass) and Luciano Rossi (keyboards). To date, Idlewild have released seven full-length studio albums, with their latest, Everything Ever Written, released in February 2015. Initially, Idlewild's sound was faster and more dissonant than many of their 1990s indie rock contemporaries. However, it developed over time from an edgy and angular sound (as heard in their early material\u2014once described by the NME as \"the sound of a flight of stairs falling down a flight of stairs\") to a sweeping, melodic rock sound as displayed on The Remote Part and Warnings/Promises. While Idlewild's sound cannot be easily placed into a specific genre, they have clearly been influenced by the likes of: Gang of Four, Pavement, R.E.M., Blur and Fugazi. In 2010, the band entered an indefinite hiatus, but reunited in late 2013 to begin work on a new studio album."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Insane Clown Posse (ICP) is an American hip hop duo from Detroit, Michigan. The group is composed of Joseph Bruce and Joseph Utsler, who perform under the respective personas of the \"wicked clowns\" Violent J and Shaggy 2 Dope (originally 2 Dope). Insane Clown Posse performs a style of hardcore hip hop known as horrorcore and is known for its elaborate live performances. The duo has earned two platinum and five gold albums. According to Nielsen SoundScan, the entire catalog of the group has sold 6.5 million units in the United States and Canada as of April 2007. Originally known as JJ Boyz and Inner City Posse, the group introduced supernatural- and horror-themed lyrics as a means of distinguishing itself stylistically. The duo founded the independent record label Psychopathic Records with Alex Abbiss as manager, and produced and starred in the feature films Big Money Hustlas and Big Money Rustlas. They formed their own professional wrestling federation, Juggalo Championship Wrestling, and later collaborated with many well-known hip hop and rock musicians. The group has established a dedicated following called Juggalos numbering in the \"tens of thousands\". The songs of Insane Clown Posse center thematically on the mythology of the Dark Carnival, a metaphoric limbo in which the lives of the dead are judged by one of several entities. The Dark Carnival is elaborated through a series of stories called Joker's Cards, each of which offers a specific lesson designed to change the \"evil ways\" of listeners before \"the end consumes us all\". The original lineup of Insane Clown Posse was John Rode (Kid Villain), John Utsler (John Kickjazz), Joe Bruce (Violent J) & Joey Utsler (Shaggy 2 Dope). John Rode left after Dog Beats was released in 1991, and John Utsler left before Carnival of Carnage was released in 1992."@en ;
