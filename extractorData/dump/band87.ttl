	dbo:abstract	"The Jake White Project was a short-lived New Jersey band that recorded three albums between 2004 and 2006. The Jake White Project (aka JWP) was formed in 2004 in Whippany, New Jersey. It was the brainchild of Jake White, a songwriter from Millburn, New Jersey who had previously played in local bands Blue Eclipse and Stinson. He was joined by two high school friends; guitarist Doug Atkins and drummer Karim Faris, along with guitarist Greg Sierpowski and keyboardist Faris Faris (brother of Karim). Once recording commenced, singer-songwriter Liliana Rose sang a few songs on the debut. The band's first album, Recreation, was released in June 2004. Shortly before the album tour, Sandra Myers took over as female lead vocalist. JWP members Jake White and Faris Faris were contracted to write songs for two independent movie releases by film company New Generation Cinema in 2004.[1] In May 2005, the band released its sophomore effort, Southbound, followed by another summer tour. After the tour, both Faris brothers, Atkins, and Myers left the group. White and Sierpowski acted as a duo in making the third (and final) Jake White Project album, On My Own, in June 2006. Following the release of the album, the group formally disbanded. White and Sierpowski both went on to record their respective solo material. Atkins now plays with up and coming singer/songwriter Jessica Rose and DiTaranto is with New York metal band Forsakken."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Kill II This (sometimes typeset as Kill 2 This) are a Metal band from Manchester, England. KILL II THIS blend extreme metal music with elements of industrial electronica, hip-hop and even opera. Terrorizer magazine summed it up by saying, \"Their sound crosses clever industrial style sampling with fearsome guitar. Kill II This have created a beast which is threatening yet danceable.\" They experienced the highs of critical acclaim and prestigious tours. They also had to deal with forced line up changes, which from time to time tested the band's resolve. But with guitarist Mark Mynett at the helm they carried on regardless, creating one innovative album after another. The first album, \"Another Cross II Bare,\" was released in 1997 and featured Jeff Singer (drums), Pete Stone (Bass) and Nick Arlea (vocals). KILL II THIS supported GRIP INC. and SKINLAB for some UK dates in June 1997 then MEGADETH on their \"Cryptic Writings\" European tour. In 1998 the second album, \"Deviate,\" was released to huge praise from press and fans alike. Matt Pollock and Caroline Campbell were recruited for vocal and bass duties, while Ben Calvert replaced Jeff Singer on drums for touring duties after the album had been recorded. Metal Hammer's review said, \"Here is an album brimming with deflowered gems; downbeat riffs that don't depress and confident grooves.\" 2000 saw KILL II THIS out on a British tour supported by EARTHTONE 9 and LINEA 77. The band's third effort, \"Trinity,\" featured FEAR FACTORY frontman Burton C. Bell guesting on the cover of FRANKIE GOES TO HOLLYWOOD's \"Two Tribes.\" The band was confirmed as support to the GODFLESH and DEVIN TOWNSEND package tour of Britain during December 2001. They would also open for SOIL's UK debut gig in January 2002. Kerrang! said, \" Kill II This set about putting the last 20 years of heavy guitar music into a blender, and arrive at a sound that puts them out as one of THE most cutting edge bands around.\" The fourth album, 2003's 'Mass.[Down.]-Sin.(Drone) was recorded with vocalist Phil Bretnall and drummer Steve Rooney. Pete Stone returned on bass. European tours with Anthrax, Fear Factory, Type O Negative, Slipknot and Machine Head followed as well as a headline European tour with Area 54 as support. In the Spring of 2004 Mark Mynett revealed that the fifth KILL II THIS album would be the band's last. However, plans for the swan song KILL II THIS outing took on a new direction when the record, entitled, \"A New Spiritual Mountain,\" was released under the brand new band name CITY OF GOD. This new outfit comprised Jeff Singer, fresh from his stints with PARADISE LOST and BLAZE, Simon Gordon, ex-XENTRIX / Hellfighter, and Tim Preston, ex-DEARLY BEHEADED. The band didn't tour in support of this album and it seemed KILL II THIS had indeed come to an end. Mark Mynett is now a Senior Lecturer in Music Technology & Production at the University of Huddersfield and currently resides in Manchester, England. Mynett has recently had the cover feature published in November 2009's issue of Sound on Sound magazine where he discusses 'Extreme Metal Production'. Mynett still actively produces albums from his studio in Huddersfield, England."@en ;

The group released nine records between 2004\u20132008, touring extensively throughout the United States, Europe, and Mexico.

The goup received the first Grammy Award for Best Rap Performance in 1989 for \"Parents Just Don't Understand\" (1988), though their most successful single was \"Summertime\" (1991), which earned the group their second Grammy and peaked at number 4 on the Billboard Hot 100. Will Smith and Jeff Townes are still friends and claim that they never split up, having made songs under Smith's solo performer credit. DJ Jazzy Jeff & the Fresh Prince have sold over 5.5 million albums in the US."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Josh Joplin Group was an American Georgia-based folk rock band led by singer-songwriter Josh Joplin. Joplin brought the group its trademark combination of introspective lyrics, catchy melodies, and lead vocals that, to many, sound identical to those of R.E.M. singer Michael Stipe (to the point that one Joplin song, \"Happy at Last,\" begins, \"I sound like Michael Stipe and I dream like Carl Jung\"). After releasing two independent albums - Projector Head and Boxing Nostalgic - under the name Josh Joplin Band, the group signed to Artemis Records and released Useful Music in 2001. Produced largely by Shawn Mullins, the album received strong reviews but failed to make much commercial impact. It did, however, spawn a mild hit in \"Camera One,\". Featuring a more rock-edged, radio-friendly sound than most of the material on Useful Music, the song peaked at #22 on the Billboard Adult Top 40 chart in 2001, and was featured in an episode of the comedy series Scrubs (season 1, episode 7, \"My Super Ego\"). In September 2002, Josh Joplin Group released its second major-label album, The Future That Was. On this record, Joplin's lyrics were noticeably more clever and playful than on Useful Music, with subject matter including the nature of popularity (\"The Wonderful Ones\"), the absurdity of snobbery among music lovers (\"It's Only Entertainment\"), and the uselessness of trying to predict the future (\"The Future That Was\"). The musical styles were similarly varied, ranging from slow piano- and acoustic guitar-driven pop to upbeat keyboard- and electric guitar-based rock. Like its predecessor, The Future That Was received critical acclaim but sold poorly. Artemis released two singles from the album, \"I Am Not the Only Cowboy\" and \"Wonder Wheel,\" but neither one took off. In the fall of 2003, the band announced that it was breaking up and would play its final two shows in Atlanta in December of that year."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"AfterImage is a Filipino rock band who was active in the 1990s. They disbanded in 2001 after 11 years as a band, having released three studio albums. After disbanding, Wency Cornejo, the band's vocalist, pursued a solo career. AfterImage was the band behind the commercially popular songs \"Habang May Buhay\" (While There's Life), \"Next in Line\", and \"Mangarap Ka\" (Dream). In 2008, the band reunited and released their fourth studio album. The band's first album, entitled Touch the Sun, was released in 1992 on Dyna Records (now Dyna Music). Among the eight songs that the album contained, four were released as singles: \"Bai (Sa Langit ang Ating Tagpuan)\", \"Only You\", \"Next in Line\", and \"Pagtawid\". The title of the album, which was the concluding part of the lyric to \"Next in Line\", was said to have just been a spontaneous utter of phrase which Cornejo made during the recording session for the said song. The band, having thought that the phrase, \"touch the sun\" had captured the essence and concept of the entire album, prompted them to use it as the album's title. The recurrent theme of the songs in the album was a personal expression of hopes, frustrations, and self-renewal - which the band hoped to touch not only their own lives but also the lives of other people. The album is also said to be a celebration of about 4 years of musical experimentation. According to them, \"It is quite difficult to put all the songs in the album in one perspective, considering they encompass so many growths the band has undergone.\""@en ;

Crass popularised the anarcho-punk movement of the punk subculture, advocating direct action, animal rights, feminism and environmentalism. The band used and advocated a DIY punk ethic approach to its sound collages, leaflets, albums and films. Crass spray-painted stencilled graffiti messages in the London Underground system and on advertising billboards, coordinated squats and organised political action. The band expressed its ideals by dressing in black, military-surplus-style clothing and using a stage backdrop amalgamating icons of perceived authority such as the Christian cross, the swastika, the Union Jack and the ouroboros. The band was critical of punk subculture and youth culture in general. Crass promoted an anarchism which became more common in the punk-music scene. They are considered art punk in their use of tape collages, graphics, spoken word releases, poetry and improvisation."@en ;

	foaf:name	"The Klaudt Indian Family"@en ;
	dbo:abstract	"The Klaudt Indian Family was a professional southern gospel group. They were noted as being one of the most diverse groups to ever travel the gospel music circuits. Reverend Reinhold Klaudt was a German cattleman who married Lillian White Corn Little Soldier of the Arikara-Mandan tribe of Indians. She was a direct descendant of one of General Custer's scouts at the Battle of Little Big Horn and also a descendant of Chief Sitting Bull. Their story began on the Fort Berthold Indian Reservation in North Dakota. Together, they raised a family dedicated to spreading the gospel through song. Originally from \"the badlands of North Dakota,\" the Klaudt Indian Family traveled the countryside spreading the gospel. The Klaudts were members of the Church of God, and the Klaudts desired for their children to be educated in that faith at the Bible Training School in Cleveland, Tennessee. All of the children received their formal education there, where they expanded their musical abilities. The family consisted of Vernon, Melvin, Raymond, and Ken and their sister Ramona. The Klaudt Indian Family began performing with Mom and Dad Klaudt, Vernon, Ramona, and Melvin. The other siblings joined the group as the years passed. Dad Klaudt left the performing group after several years to concentrate on being the business manager for the group. The Klaudts settled in the Atlanta area and soon began traveling across the country holding revival services and singing in gospel concerts. The Klaudt Indian Family featured various instruments in their program including the upright bass, trumpet, tenor saxophone, baritone saxophone, trombone, and piano. Their music had a jazz flavor that helped open doors to the group previously unknown to the typical gospel quartet. They were also one of the first gospel singing aggregations to use a custom designed motor coach in their travels and also used semi-trucks to haul tent equipment that would expand to a seating capacity of 3,000. The gospel music audiences in the early years must have been taken aback at the performances of the Klaudt Indian Family. While all the other groups in gospel music were using only a piano for their accompaniment, the Klaudts would showcase their music with strings and horns. Not only did their instrumentation set them apart from the norm, but they often performed in elaborate Native American costumes. This unique presentation allowed them to appear in many venues across the country. They quickly became a fixture on the Wally Fowler All Night Singing programs. It has been said that the Klaudt Indian Family was the first nationally known gospel music group, due to their engagements throughout the country. In addition to gospel concerts and church venues, they played engagements in Las Vegas, state fairs, professional sports games, and theme parks. In their heyday, they would typically play more than 400 dates a year. In addition to their singing, the Klaudt Indian Family also had their own recording label. They recorded several other gospel groups on their Family Tone label, and published sheet music and song folios to distribute to the gospel music community. The Klaudt Indian Family demonstrated their versatility in their musical arrangements as they would perform in various aggregations including a male quartet, mixed trio, male trio, duets, solos, and instrumentals in their programs and on their recordings. Solos by Mom Klaudt backed by her boys highlighted each Klaudt Indian Family performance. Television was a vital part in the growing popularity of the Klaudt Indian Family. They were fixtures on the syndicated program, Bob Poole's Gospel Favorites. The Klaudt Indian Family traveled as a group for more than five decades before retiring in the early 1980s. The Klaudts came out of retirement to perform for the last time on the stage of the Grand Ole Gospel Reunion in 1996 which featured Mom Klaudt at age 90. Mom Klaudt died in March 2001 and Dad died about four months later. Mrs. Klaudt was inducted into the Southern Gospel Music Association Hall of Fame in 2004. Most of her family was there to share in this honor. According to the website SoGospelNews.com, Vernon Klaudt, the oldest remaining member of the Klaudt Indian Family died September 9, 2006 At 4:45 PM. Vernon succumbed to the disease of cancer that wracked his body for over eight years. During his last months he found time to travel in and around Atlanta, Georgia. His last ministerial effort was to raise the necessary monies to pay the 2006-2007 winter heat bill for the Fort Berthold Reservation's Indian Mission. This mission was very close to the heart of Vernon, for many of his immediate and extended Indian family received their salvation experience in this little mission. The siblings are all still living and involved in various business ventures. They continue to keep the ministry of the Klaudt Indian Family alive. They have established the Klaudt Indian Memorial Foundation to fund scholarships through Lee University in Cleveland, Tennessee and the New Orleans Baptist Theological Seminary in New Orleans, Louisiana. The purpose of the scholarships is to honor the heritage and legacy of Mom and Dad Klaudt and to promote the teaching of gospel music to a new generation. On November 24, 2007 the Klaudt Indian Family was inducted into the Atlanta Country Music Hall of Fame and \"Lillian Little Soldier Klaudt\" was inducted into the Southern Gospel Museum and Hall of Fame. On August 24, 2008 the Klaudt Indian Family received the \"Lifetime Achievement Award\" presented by the Atlanta Society of Entertainers. During the year of 2010 The Klaudt Indian Family, through their 501 (c) 3 Public Charity, the \"Klaudt Indian Memorial Foundation\" is producing a TV Ministry. The TV Ministry entitled, Just Keep Singing, is presently viewed through several TV outlets in Georgia. The TV program is produced in the studios of TV 57 WATC Atlanta Georgia. Melvin Klaudt, host of the program uses, not only the Klaudts videos, but also features some of the legendary groups of the past along with many of the present day Southern Gospel Groups. The television program is now viewed world wide throughout their collaboration with aic-TV. aic-TV is an American Indian ministry out of Oklahoma City, Oklahoma."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"The Apolinario Mabini Hiking Society, later popularly known as APO Hiking Society, or simply APO, was a Filipino musical group. The group had its fledgling beginnings in 1969 at the Ateneo de Manila high school, with 15 members: John Paul Micayabas, Lito de Joya, Sonny Santiago, Gus Cosio, Renato Garcia, Chito Kintanar, Kenny Barton, Bruce Brown, Butch Dans, Kinjo Sawada, Ric Segreto, Goff Macaraeg, Doden Besa, Jim Paredes, and Boboy Garovillo. The group's name was created from the acronym AMHS representing their school with a witty twist having an irreverent reference to the paralyzed Philippine revolutionary intellectual and hero, Apolinario Mabini, and later shortened to \"Apo\", an Ilocano term for a wise man or a Tagalog term of grandchildren, and later re-branded to \"APO\" (all caps). Contrary to popular belief, the \"Apo\" name was not a reference to the Philippines's highest peak, the potentially-active stratovolcano Mount Apo. As the students advanced into college, Danny Javier joined the group. After graduation, the majority of its members left to pursue individual careers, with only three members remaining, made up of Jim Paredes, Boboy Garovillo and Danny Javier. In the span of their professional career, Apo emerged as a principal adherent of the musical movement termed Original Pilipino Music (a.k.a. OPM), a milieu in which their original musical contributions and cultural influence became essential. The Apo became involved in record production, talent management and organizing artists under the Organisasyon ng Pilipinong Mang-aawit (O.P.M., acronym translation: \"Organization of Philippine Singers/musicians\"). The group expanded its activities into establishing and furthering the careers of new OPM artists in the Philippines. To date, the group has released 27 albums in four decades of its career. Two hugely successful tribute albums were produced in 2006 and 2007 by its management group, featuring numerous young bands freshly reinterpreting Apo's expansive repertoire. The group frequently utilized their brand name, \"Apo,\" as a clever component for Tagalog puns in titles for television shows, live programs and marketing materials, for example, as in nA PO, which transliterates as \"already\" (polite/formal usage), and also as ap\u00F3 (meaning, \"grandchild\"). The puns have been minimally extended into English, as in (APOcalyptic)."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Anal Cunt, also known as AxCx and A.C., was an American grindcore band that formed in Newton, Massachusetts in 1988. Since its inception, the band underwent a number of line-up changes. Known for its grindcore musical style and controversial lyrics, Anal Cunt released eight full-length studio albums in addition to a number of compilations and extended plays. On June 11, 2011, the band's frontman and founder Seth Putnam died of a suspected heart attack, ending the band. They have been categorized as grindcore, noisecore, noisegrind and hardcore. The band is often referred to by their initials A.C. (often written as AxCx) due to the offensive nature of their name and censorship limits on some radio and publications, and many of their album covers simply display the initials A.C. However, the band managed to subvert even this abbreviation by drawing these letters in a manner resembling an anus and a vulva. Their early material contained no pre-written lyrics or music. Rather, the band developed a style which consisted of extremely loud, fast, and aggressive noise that was created entirely on the spot. Over the years, the band eventually shifted their style and slowly began to incorporate more riffs and pre-written lyrics into their songs. It was not until then that the band earned the reputation for intentionally being outrageous and offensive. In 2011, they released a \"cock rock\" album entitled Fuckin' A. An album of material similar to their old grindcore albums called Wearing Out Our Welcome was released digitally in 2010."@en ;

The group had international Top 20 hits with \"Kiss\" and the instrumental \"Peter Gunn\", which won a 1986 Grammy Award. The group's mostly instrumental compositions were novel melodic sound collages based on digital sampler technology, which was new at the time. Inspired by turn-of-the-20th-century revolutions in music, the Art of Noise were initially packaged as a faceless anti- or non-group, blurring the distinction between the art and its creators. The band is noted for innovative use of electronics and computers in pop music and particularly for innovative use of sampling. From the earliest releases on ZTT, the band referred to itself as both Art of Noise and The Art of Noise. Official and unofficial releases and press material use both versions."@en ;

Between 1989 and 1995, Babes in Toyland released three studio albums; Spanking Machine (1990), the commercially successful Fontanelle (1992), and Nemesisters (1995), before becoming inactive in 1997 and eventually disbanding in 2001. While the band was inspirational to some performers in the riot grrrl movement in the Pacific Northwest, Babes in Toyland never associated themselves with the movement. In August 2014, Babes In Toyland announced that they would be reuniting."@en ;

The quartet was one of the Soviet Union's best known in the West during the Cold War era, through concert performances in the United States and Europe and through distribution of their recordings. The quartet had a close relationship with composer Dmitri Shostakovich, who personally consulted them on each of his quartets. They also performed with the pianist Sviatoslav Richter on many occasions. They have recorded all of Shostakovich's string quartets as well as all of Beethoven's quartets. Their many recordings include works by a wide range of composers on the Melodiya, Teldec, Virgin Records, and Chandos Records labels. The original Borodin quartet's sound was characterised by an almost symphonic volume and a highly developed ability to phrase whilst maintaining group cohesion. Although it has seen many changes in personnel over its life span, all members of the quartet have been graduates of the Moscow Conservatory."@en ;

Their original lineup included Stephen Stills (guitar, keyboards, vocals), Dewey Martin (drums, vocals), Bruce Palmer (electric bass), Richie Furay (guitar, vocals), and Neil Young (guitar, harmonica, piano, vocals). Pioneering the folk rock genre, Buffalo Springfield, along with the Byrds, combined elements of folk and country music with British invasion influences into their early works. Their second studio album, Buffalo Springfield Again, marked their progression to psychedelia and hard rock. With a name taken from a steamroller, the group signed to Atlantic Records in 1966 and released their debut single \u201CNowadays Clancy Can\u2019t Even Sing\" - a regional hit in Los Angeles. The following January, the group released the protest song they were most prominently known for, \"For What It's Worth\". After various drug-related arrests and line-up changes, the group decided to break up in 1968. Stephen Stills went on to form the folk rock supergroup Crosby, Stills & Nash with David Crosby of the Byrds and Graham Nash of the Hollies. Neil Young had launched his successful solo career and reunited with Stills in Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young in 1969. The group was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1997."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Jefferson Airplane was a San Francisco, California-based band who pioneered the American counterculture movement as well as psychedelic rock. Formed in 1965, the group defined the San Francisco Sound and was the first from the Bay Area to achieve international commercial success. They were headliners at the three most famous American rock festivals of the 1960s\u2014Monterey (1967), Woodstock (1969) and Altamont (1969)\u2014in addition to the first Isle of Wight Festival (1968)  in England. Their 1967 break-out record Surrealistic Pillow ranks on the short list of most significant recordings of the \"Summer of Love\". Two songs from that album, \"Somebody to Love\" and \"White Rabbit\", are among Rolling Stone's \"500 Greatest Songs of All Time.\" The \"classic\" line-up of Jefferson Airplane remained stable from 1967 to early 1970, and consisted of Marty Balin, Jack Casady, Spencer Dryden, Paul Kantner, Jorma Kaukonen and Grace Slick. The group broke up in 1972 and split into two bands: Hot Tuna and Jefferson Starship. Jefferson Airplane was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1996, and honored with the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 2016."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Ministry is an American industrial metal band founded by lead singer and only original member Al Jourgensen in 1981. Originally a new wave synthpop outfit, Ministry changed its style to become one of the pioneers of industrial metal in the mid-1980s. Ministry found mainstream success in the early 1990s with their fifth studio album Psalm 69: The Way to Succeed and the Way to Suck Eggs (1992) and touring as part of the Lollapalooza festival. After 27 years of performing, Jourgensen decided to end the band in 2008, saying a reunion would never happen. However, in August 2011, a reunion was announced, when Ministry confirmed they would play one of their first shows in four years at the Wacken Open Air festival in August 2012. Ministry released a new album, Relapse, on March 23, 2012, which was followed by a world tour. Following the death of long time guitarist Mike Scaccia, Ministry released their most recent studio album From Beer to Eternity in September 2013, and subsequently began to tour again with new guitarist Cesar Soto."@en ;
