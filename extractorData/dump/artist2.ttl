Best known for his work with The Living Jarboe and In Gowan Ring, sometimes in a musician role and sometimes as a producer/engineer. In the 1990s he sometimes recorded under the name pFrenz-C, but he no longer uses the pseudonym. After moving to Seattle in the early 1990s he was involved in a variety of different groups with no particular style in common: Prayers for the Raven (Seattle\u2019s seminal goth band), Hooo (texture noise), Rosa Luna (i.e. Mazzy Star, Low), Salon Betty (punk-polka-death lounge spearheaded by Betty X), Absinthee (with Gordon Raphael of The Strokes fame & Sky Cries Mary), Faith and Disease (ethereal pop), Euclid (Americana), Purr Bats (disco fluff), Shadow Light (synthy-goth) and several psychedelic performance art groups. The risqu\u00E9 performances of Salon Betty were often referred to as \u201CThe Big Hair Sex Circus\u201D and offered a sharp contrast to Seattle\u2019s \u201Cgrunge\u201D scene at the time. While working with iMusic they created the internet\u2019s first \u201Cinteractive paper-doll\u201D and started an early internet reality show in 1996 called \u201CThe Surreal World\u201D winning awards for their work. In the late 1990s Brian began recording and co-producing with Jarboe. Their first collaborative project together was for the compilation on Vhuz music called \u201CVomit Veritas\u201D and later on Jarboe\u2019s first post-SWANS recording \u201CAnhedoniac\u201D. He has also recorded and appeared on many of Jarboe's compilation contributions and a few of her other albums. As of 2009, Brian started producing video motion graphics, animation and stop motion work.

	dbo:abstract	"Phil Pritchett (born 1971) is a rock and roll musician from Texas. Members of his band have varied over the years. The current incarnation of the Full Band includes J.W. \"Blu\" Marshall on bass and Stu Wiley on drums. Phil's performance to his eighth grade class of The Beatles Love Me Do first inspired him to enter into music. Phil got his real musical start at age 13 starting a Van Halen-style cover band and started playing local parties. His original high school band the Suburbans was an acclaimed Texas rock trio before breaking up in 1990. Phil graduated from Highland Park High School in 1990, and entered Southwestern University studying History. At Southwestern University in Georgetown, Texas, Pritchett formed the eclectic acoustic duo Romantic Embargo with friend James Dewitt. They played regularly in Austin and surrounding cities and made two recordings, a live tape \"Cut Me Some Slacks\" and a CD \"Central Chilling Station No.5.\" Pritchett went out on his own in 1996 and spent 5 years living in Austin, Texas and playing his original music to fans all over Texas and the South and building a large regional fan base. He started Spitune Records in 1995 and began recording and releasing his music independently. After a brief stint in Nashville, he moved back to Texas and has been touring consistently since 2002, often playing 150 shows a year or more. Pritchett is known for his insightful songs, artistic albums and his live performances. His high-energy shows around Texas and the surrounding areas are known for the performances of songs such as \"Song of the Doorman\", \"High Tide in the Heartland\", \"Luke Skywalker and Indiana Jones\", \"Colorado On Trial,\" \"Tougher Than the Rest\" and the all-time fan-favorites: \"Maria,\" \"Snuff Machine\" (written by ex-Suburbans' member Wes Cunningham), \"Antarctica U.S.A.\" (written by Dewitt now of the Residudes), and \"Drink When I Think\" and \"Rolling\" (both co-written with Chip Evans). In 2006, Pritchett opened Trinidad World Recording in the Fort Worth Stockyards to self-produce his album High Tide in the Heartland. After the release of High Tide, he was asked to produce records for other acts at Trinidad. His producing credits include projects by Texas High Life, Johns Guns, Ty Wick, Magee Payne, Kurt South, J.D. Clark, Kyle Redd, Clay Thrash, Kevin Smith, Slow Rollin' Lows, Zach Huckabee, Mike Mathis, Notorious Gringos, Change of Standard and several of his own albums. Trinidad World Recording is now located in the old Handley post office in Fort Worth. Phil has played with many of the fan favorites in Texas including Jack Ingram, Roger Creager, Honeybrowne and others. In 2007, Phil began selling his albums in MP3 format for $4 each at p2tunes.com. In 2009, Pritchett launched the P2 Podcast from his website. The weekly, hour long show delves into life as a musician, road stories, and discusses current challenges in the changing music business. He is frequently joined by guests, usually people he knows from his time in the industry including Kurt South, Pat Green, Pete Coatney (from Jack Ingram's band), Zach Huckabee, Buddy Huffman (Macon Greyson), Owen Temple, Wes Cunningham and others. 2011 marked the beginning of the \"Trinidad Tribute\" series.

Born in the South Jamaica neighborhood of the borough of Queens, Jackson began selling drugs at age twelve during the 1980s crack epidemic. Although he left drug-dealing to pursue a musical career, he was struck by nine bullets in a 2000 shooting. After Jackson released the compilation album Guess Who's Back? in 2002, he was discovered by Eminem and signed by Shady Records, Aftermath Entertainment and Interscope Records. With the aid of Eminem and Dr. Dre (who produced his first major-label album, Get Rich or Die Tryin'), Jackson became one of the world's best selling rappers and rose to prominence with East Coast hip hop group G-Unit (which he leads de facto). In 2003 he founded G-Unit Records, signing his G-Unit associates Young Buck, Lloyd Banks and Tony Yayo. Jackson had similar commercial and critical success with his second album, The Massacre, which was released in 2005. He released his fifth studio album, Animal Ambition, in 2014 and is working on his sixth studio album: Street King Immortal. He executive produces the show Power, which airs on Starz. During his career Jackson has sold over 30 million albums worldwide and won several awards, including a Grammy Award, thirteen Billboard Music Awards, six World Music Awards, three American Music Awards and four BET Awards. He has pursued an acting career, appearing in the semi-autobiographical film Get Rich or Die Tryin' (2005), the Iraq War film Home of the Brave (2006) and Righteous Kill (2008). 50 Cent was ranked the sixth-best artist of the 2000s, the third-best rapper (behind Eminem and Nelly).

	dbo:abstract	"Alan Lomax (January 31, 1915 \u2013 July 19, 2002) was an American field collector of folk music of the 20th century. He was also a folklorist, ethnomusicologist, archivist, writer, scholar, political activist, oral historian, and film-maker. Lomax produced recordings, concerts, and radio shows in the US and in England, which played an important role in both the American and British folk revivals of the 1940s, 1950s and early 1960s. He collected material first with his father, folklorist and collector John A. Lomax, and later alone and with others, Lomax recorded thousands of songs and interviews for the Archive of American Folk Song, of which he was the director, at the Library of Congress on aluminum and acetate discs. After 1942, when Congress cut off the Library of Congress's funding for folk song collecting, Lomax continued to collect independently in Britain, Ireland, the Caribbean, Italy, and Spain, as well as the United States, using the latest recording technology, assembling an enormous collection of American and international culture. In March 2004 the material captured and produced without Library of Congress funding was acquired by the Library, which 'brings the entire seventy years of Alan Lomax's work together under one roof at the Library of Congress, where it has found a permanent home.'  With the start of the Cold War, Lomax continued to speak out for a public role for folklore, even as academic folklorists turned inward. He devoted much of the latter part of his life to advocating what he called Cultural Equity, which he sought to put on a solid theoretical foundation through to his Cantometrics research (which included a prototype Cantometrics-based educational program, the Global Jukebox). In the 1970s and 1980s Lomax advised the Smithsonian Institution's Folklife Festival and produced a series of films about folk music, American Patchwork, which aired on PBS in 1991. In his late seventies, Lomax completed a long-deferred memoir, The Land Where the Blues Began (1995), linking the birth of the blues to debt peonage, segregation, and forced labor in the American South."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Armand John \"A.J.\" Piron (August 16, 1888 \u2013 February 17, 1943) was an American jazz violinist, band leader, and composer. In 1915, Piron and Clarence Williams together started the Piron and Williams Publishing Company, and in their first year of business published Piron's composition, \u201CI Wish That I Could Shimmy Like My Sister Kate\u201D, which became his biggest hit. After touring briefly with W.C. Handy in 1917, he started an orchestra under his own name, which soon included such notables as Lorenzo Tio and Steve Lewis. Piron's New Orleans Orchestra quickly became the best paid African American band in New Orleans, for Piron landed regular jobs at both the Spanish Fort amusement park and the exclusive white New Orleans Country Club. In 1923, Piron took his band to New York City as part of his ambition to make the group nationally known. He succeeded in making a hit there, landing a residency at the Roseland Ballroom, and making recordings for three different companies, Okeh, Victor and Columbia. The influence of Piron's band on the New York scene can be heard in the records of other New York bands of that time, such as Fletcher Henderson's (although Piron's influence on New York music would be eclipsed a year later when Louis Armstrong arrived in the city). In early 1924, some of Piron's band members were finding the cold northern winter and unfamiliar food and culture objectionable. Piron put the matter to a vote and, to Piron's frustration, the majority of the band voted to return home. Back in New Orleans, he again lined up good jobs, returning to the Country Club, playing at Tranchina's Restaurant and on the excursion steamships Capital and President into the 1930s; in about 1935, he decided to dramatically change the sound of his orchestra to swing, in line with popular taste."@en .

Also an author, Shaw wrote both fiction and non-fiction. Widely regarded as \"one of jazz's finest clarinetists,\" Shaw led one of the United States' most popular big bands in the late 1930s through the early 1940s. Though he had numerous hit records, he was perhaps best known for his 1938 recording of Cole Porter's \"Begin the Beguine.\" Prior to the release of \"Beguine,\" Shaw and his fledgling band had languished in relative obscurity for over two years and, after its release, he became a major pop artist within short order. The record eventually became one of the era's defining recordings. Musically restless, Shaw was also an early proponent of what became known much later as Third Stream music, which blended elements of classical and jazz forms and traditions. His music influenced other musicians, such as John Barry in England, with the vamp of the James Bond Theme, possibly influenced by \"Nightmare,\" which also has a similar vamp to Kurt Weill's \"Lonely House.\" Shaw also recorded with small jazz groups drawn from within the ranks of the various big bands he led. He served in the US Navy from 1942 to 1944, (during which time he led a morale-building band that toured the South Pacific amidst the chaos of World War II) and, following his discharge in 1944, he returned to lead a band through 1945. Following the breakup of that band, he began to focus on other interests and gradually withdrew from the world of being a professional musician and major celebrity, although he remained a force in popular music and jazz before retiring from music completely in 1954."@en ;

After a brief time as a comedy actress in the mid-1970s, she became a prominent television presenter in the 1980s and 1990s, hosting hit entertainment shows such as Blind Date (1985\u20132003), The Moment of Truth (1998\u20132001) and Surprise Surprise (1984\u20132001). In 2013, Black celebrated her 50 years in show business. British television network ITV honoured this milestone with a one-off entertainment special which aired on 16 October 2013. The show, called The One & Only Cilla Black, featured Black herself and was hosted by Paul O'Grady. Black died on 1 August 2015 after a fall in her villa in Estepona, Spain. The day after her funeral, the compilation album The Very Best of Cilla Black went to number one on the UK Albums Chart and the New Zealand Albums Chart; it was her first number one album."@en ;

One of the first prominent jazz musicians on his instrument, as Joachim E. Berendt explained: \"there were some tenor players before him, but the instrument was not an acknowledged jazz horn\". While Hawkins is strongly associated with the swing music and big band era, he had a role in the development of bebop in the 1940s. Fellow saxophonist Lester Young, known as \"Pres\", commented in a 1959 interview with The Jazz Review: \"As far as I'm concerned, I think Coleman Hawkins was the President first, right? As far as myself, I think I'm the second one.\" Miles Davis once said: \"When I heard Hawk, I learned to play ballads.\""@en ;

Badu's career began after opening a show for D'Angelo in 1994 in her hometown; record label executive Kedar Massenburg was highly impressed with her performance and signed her to Kedar Entertainment. Her first album, Baduizm, was released on February 11, 1997. It spawned three singles: \"On & On\", \"Next Lifetime\" and \"Otherside of the Game\". The album was certified triple Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).Badu's first live album, Live, was released on November 18, 1997 and was certified double Platinum by the RIAA. Badu's second studio album, Mama's Gun, was released on October 31, 2000. It spawned three singles: \"Bag Lady\", which became her first top 10 single on the Billboard Hot 100 peaking at #6, \"Didn't Cha Know?\" and \"Cleva\". The album was certified Platinum by the RIAA. Badu's third album, Worldwide Underground, was released on September 16, 2003. It generated three singles: \"Love of My Life (An Ode to Hip-Hop)\", \"Danger\" and \"Back in the Day (Puff)\" with 'Love' becoming her second song to reach the top 10 of the Billboard Hot 100, peaking at #9. The album was certified Gold by the RIAA. Badu's fourth album, New Amerykah Part One, was released on February 26, 2008. It spawned two singles: \"Honey\" and \"Soldier\". New Amerykah Part Two was released in 2010 and fared well both critically and commercially. It contained the album's lead single \"Window Seat\", which led to controversy. Influenced by R&B, 1970s soul, and 1980s hip hop, Badu became associated with the neo soul subgenre in the 1990s along with artists like D'Angelo. Her work has often been compared to jazz great Billie Holiday. Early in her career, Badu was recognizable for her eccentric style, which often included wearing very large and colorful headwraps. She was a core member of the Soulquarians. As an actress, she has played a wide range of supporting roles in movies including Blues Brothers 2000, The Cider House Rules and House of D. She also speaks at length in the documentaries Before the Music Dies and The Black Power Mixtapes."@en .

	dbo:abstract	"Louis Thomas Jordan (July 8, 1908 \u2013 February 4, 1975) was a pioneering American musician, songwriter and bandleader who was popular from the late 1930s to the early 1950s. Known as \"The King of the Jukebox\", he was highly popular with both black and white audiences in the later years of the swing era. Jordan was one of the most successful African-American musicians of the 20th century, ranking fifth in the list of the all-time most successful black recording artists according to Billboard magazine's chart methodology. Though comprehensive sales figures are not available, he had at least four million-selling hits during his career. Jordan regularly topped the R&B \"race\" charts and was one of the first black recording artists to achieve significant crossover in popularity with the mainstream (predominantly white) American audience, having simultaneous Top Ten hits on the white pop charts on several occasions. After Duke Ellington and Count Basie, Jordan was probably the most popular and successful African-American bandleader of his time. Jordan was a talented singer with great comedic flair, and he fronted his own band for more than twenty years. He duetted with some of the biggest solo singing stars of his time, including Bing Crosby, Ella Fitzgerald and Louis Armstrong. Jordan was also an actor and a major black film personality\u2014he appeared in dozens of \"soundies\" (promotional film clips), made numerous cameos in mainstream features and short films, and starred in two musical feature films made especially for him. He was an instrumentalist who played all forms of the saxophone but specialized in the alto. He also played the piano and clarinet. A productive songwriter, he wrote or co-wrote many songs that were influential classics of 20th-century popular music. Jordan began his career in big-band swing jazz in the 1930s, but he became famous as one of the leading practitioners, innovators and popularizers of jump blues, a swinging, up-tempo, dance-oriented hybrid of jazz, blues and boogie-woogie. Typically performed by smaller bands consisting of five or six players, jump music featured shouted, highly syncopated vocals and earthy, comedic lyrics on contemporary urban themes. It strongly emphasized the rhythm section of piano, bass and drums; after the mid-1940s, this mix was often augmented by electric guitar. Jordan's band also pioneered the use of the electric organ. With his dynamic Tympany Five bands, Jordan mapped out the main parameters of the classic R&B, urban blues and early rock'n'roll genres with a series of hugely influential 78 rpm discs for the Decca label. These recordings presaged many of the styles of black popular music of the late 1940s, 1950s and 1960s and exerted a strong influence on many leading performers in these genres. Many of his records were produced by Milt Gabler, who went on to refine and develop the qualities of Jordan's recordings in his later production work with Bill Haley, including \"Rock Around the Clock\"."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Paul Vaughn Butterfield (December 17, 1942 \u2013 May 4, 1987) was an American blues harmonica player and singer. After early training as a classical flautist, he developed an interest in blues harmonica. He explored the blues scene in his native Chicago, where he met Muddy Waters and other blues greats, who provided encouragement and opportunities for him to join in jam sessions. He soon began performing with fellow blues enthusiasts Nick Gravenites and Elvin Bishop. In 1963, he formed the Paul Butterfield Blues Band, which recorded several successful albums and were popular on the late-1960s concert and festival circuit, with performances at the Fillmore West, in San Francisco; the Fillmore East, in New York City; the Monterey Pop Festival; and Woodstock. The band was known for combining electric Chicago blues with a rock urgency and for their pioneering jazz fusion performances and recordings. After the breakup of the group in 1971, Butterfield continued to tour and record with the band Paul Butterfield's Better Days, with his mentor Muddy Waters, and with members of the roots-rock group the Band. While still recording and performing, Butterfield died in 1987 at age 44 of a heroin overdose. Music critics have acknowledged his development of an original approach that places him among the best-known blues harp players. In 2006, he was inducted into the Blues Hall of Fame. Butterfield and the early members of the Paul Butterfield Blues Band were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2015. Both panels noted his harmonica skills and his contributions to bringing blues music to a younger and broader audience."@en ;

After the duo went their separate ways, Rock continued with a solo career that has garnered him worldwide respect, though little in the way of mainstream success. Along with groups such as Stetsasonic, Gang Starr, A Tribe Called Quest and The Roots, Rock played a major role in the merging of elements from jazz into hip hop music (also known as jazz rap). He is widely recognized as one of the greatest hip hop producers of all time, and is often mentioned alongside DJ Premier, RZA and J Dilla as one of the mainstays of 1990s East Coast hip hop production.

Barbour was born in Long Island, New York started off as a banjoist with Adrian Rollini in 1933 and then Wingy Manone in 1934. He switched to guitar in the middle of the decade and played with Red Norvo in 1935-1936. He found much work as a studio musician and played in ensembles with Teddy Wilson and Billie Holiday (1937), Artie Shaw (1939), Lennie Hayton, Charlie Barnet (1945), Raymond Scott, Glenn Miller, Lou Holden, and Woody Herman (1949). He also recorded with Andr\u00E9 Previn in 1945. He played with Benny Goodman in 1942, and while a member of Goodman's ensemble, he fell in love with lead singer Peggy Lee, and the pair quit the group to marry in 1943. Soon after they moved to Los Angeles, Johnny Mercer put them to work as a songwriting team, and they wrote a number of Lee's hits, such as \"Ma\u00F1ana (Is Soon Enough for Me)\" and \"It's a Good Day\". The couple had a daughter, Nicki, in 1943. Barbour was an alcoholic and had domestic troubles with Lee; this eventually split apart their marriage, which ended in 1951. Dave Barbour and His Orchestra had the best-selling version (USA) of the peppy song \"Mambo Jambo.\" Barbour's remaining career was far less successful than Lee's (who would marry three more times). His songwriting royalties sustained him, as the tunes he co-wrote with Lee were covered by many hitmakers of the 1950s. He acted in the films The Secret Fury and Mr. Music, and occasionally performed, including with Benny Carter in 1962. He died in 1965 of a hemorrhaged ulcer in Malibu Beach, California, aged 53. He was survived by Peggy Lee, and their daughter Nicki Lee Foster."@en .

At the age of five she and her family fled the civil war in Afghanistan to settle in Canada. Raised in Vancouver, BC, Mozhdah studied Broadcast Journalism at the British Columbia Institute of Technology, and Philosophy and Political Science at the University of British Columbia. She also wrote songs. Among these songs was Dokhtare Afghan (Afghan Girl). Dokhtare Afghan was an instant hit on the Afghan TV stations and airwaves. It brought back the stories of strong Afghan heroines to the homes of many of the Afghans and sparked an interest amongst young Afghan women. It also earned Mozhdah many nominations and awards at the Afghan and International TV and radio stations. Dokhtare Afghan also brought history to Afghan Culture. On International Women\u2019s Day 2010, Mozhdah was asked to be the first Afghan to perform at the White House for President and Mrs. Obama, and the song she sang was of the bravery of Afghan Women \u201CDokhtare Afghan\u201D. In December 2009 she was offered a position to work with an up-and-coming television station in Afghanistan, 1TV. She was to be the host of Afghanistan\u2019s Got Talent. Mozhdah took the offer because it meant that she could go back to her homeland. Mozhdah's political and philosophical studies also gave her the drive to pursue more difficult ambitions. Once she joined 1TV, she soon decided she wanted to make her trip to Afghanistan fulfill her desire to make a difference. The concept of the Mozhdah show was created. On the Mozhdah Show, Mozhdah and her producers created programming that addressed hard hitting and taboo topics in Afghan society, and what it was like to be a woman, a child, a person living in Afghan society. The Mozhdah Show also provided Mozhdah with the ability to explore and learn more about the current situation in Afghanistan through the eyes of Afghans."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Anthony Edwin \"Ant\" Phillips (born 23 December 1951) is an English multi-instrumentalist, primarily known as a guitarist, and first coming to prominence as a founding member of the band Genesis. He played guitar and sang backing vocals until leaving in 1970, following the recording of their second album, Trespass. He left due to touring issues including stage fright - after which his doctor told him that the best thing to do is to leave the band. He is known for his twelve string guitar work, and his influence can be heard throughout Genesis's early output. Genesis's first album after Phillips's departure, Nursery Cryme, featured two songs which were holdovers from the days when Phillips was in the band: \"The Musical Box\" (originally called F#) and \"The Fountain of Salmacis\". After leaving Genesis, Phillips studied classical music (especially classical guitar) and made recordings in collaboration with Harry Williamson, Mike Rutherford and Phil Collins, among others. He played the keyboards on the demos for Peter Gabriel in 1976. His first solo album, The Geese and the Ghost, was issued in 1977. He released his second album, Wise After the Event, in 1978. This was followed the next year by Sides. Both of these albums were produced by Rupert Hine and were intended to reach a mainstream audience, though neither album was successful in that regard. In its initial release in the UK, Sides was accompanied by a more experimental album entitled Private Parts and Pieces; in the US and Canada the two albums were issued separately. Private Parts and Pieces II: Back to the Pavilion followed the next year, and several further sequels were issued in the 1980s and 1990s. Phillips began writing material with Andrew Latimer of Camel in 1981, and was a featured performer on that band's album, The Single Factor (released in 1982). Phillips released a mainstream pop album entitled Invisible Men in 1983. He later claimed that this project went \"horribly wrong\" as a result of commercial pressures, and would subsequently eschew mainstream success in favour of more specialised material. Since leaving Genesis, Phillips has remained continuously involved in a variety of musical projects, including extensive soundtrack work in England often for the label Atmosphere part the Universal Music Group. In the mid-1990s, he released an album entitled The Living Room Concert, which featured solo acoustic versions of his earlier material. He also provided archival material for the first Genesis box set, Genesis Archive 1967\u201375, released in 1998. Several of his albums feature artwork by Peter Cross. In 2008, the first Anthony Phillips biography, The Exile, by journalist Mario Giammetti, was published in Italy (Edizioni Segno). Harvest of the Heart, a 5-CD Box Set chronicling Phillips solo career and collaborations was released in 2014."@en ;

Two years later, Tisdale released her second studio album, Guilty Pleasure. In 2013, she announced plans to make music again and confirmed that she has been recording her third studio album. From 2007 until 2015, Tisdale voiced Candace Flynn in Disney Channel's three-time Emmy Award-winning animated series Phineas and Ferb.

A chance meeting with Andy Votel at the Generation X bar in Manchester, where Gough's friends Scott Abraham and Damon Hayhurst were contributing to an exhibition by the Space Monkey Clothing Company and Votel was DJing, led to the foundation of Twisted Nerve Records. In 2002, Q magazine named Badly Drawn Boy in their list of the \"50 Bands to See Before You Die\", although this was as part of a sub-list of \"5 Bands That Could Go Either Way\" on account of Gough's tendency to talk and tell stories for extended periods in concert rather than play songs & dance."@en ;

They pioneered what came to be called the Bakersfield sound, a reference to Bakersfield, California, the city Owens called home and from which he drew inspiration for what he preferred to call American music. While Owens originally used fiddle and retained pedal steel guitar into the 1970s, his sound on records and onstage was always more stripped-down and elemental, incorporating elements of rock and roll. His signature style was based on simple storylines, infectious choruses, a twangy electric guitar, an insistent rhythm supplied by a drum track placed forward in the mix, and high two-part harmonies featuring Owens and his guitarist Don Rich. Beginning in 1969, Owens co-hosted the TV series Hee Haw with Roy Clark. He left the cast in 1986. The accidental death of Rich, his best friend, in 1974 devastated him for years and abruptly halted his career until he performed with Dwight Yoakam in 1988.

Cat Power was originally the name of Marshall's first band, but has become her moniker as a solo artist. Marshall was discovered opening for Liz Phair in 1994 by Steve Shelley of Sonic Youth and Tim Foljahn of Two Dollar Guitar, with whom she recorded her first two albums, Dear Sir (1995) and Myra Lee (1996), on the same day in 1994. In 1996 she signed with Matador Records, and released a third album of new material with Shelley and Foljahn, What Would the Community Think. Following this she released the critically acclaimed Moon Pix (1998), recorded with members of Dirty Three, and The Covers Record (2000), a collection of sparsely recorded cover songs. After a brief hiatus she reemerged in 2003 with You Are Free, featuring guest musicians Dave Grohl and Eddie Vedder, followed by the soul-influenced The Greatest (2006), recorded with numerous Memphis studio musicians, and a second covers album, Jukebox (2008). In 2012 she released the self-produced Sun, which opened at number 10 on the Billboard 200, the highest charting album of her career to date. Critics have noted the constant evolution of Cat Power's sound, with a \"mix of punk, folk and blues\" on her earliest albums, and elements of soul and other genres more prevalent in her later material. Her 2012 album Sun incorporated electronica, in a self-proclaimed move from the \"really slow guitar songs\" she initially wrote for the album."@en ;

His 1967 debut album reached the top 10 in the UK, and the album's title song \"Matthew and Son\" charted at number 2 on the UK Singles Chart. His albums Tea for the Tillerman (1970) and Teaser and the Firecat (1971) were both certified triple platinum in the US by the RIAA. His musical style consists of folk, pop, rock, and Islamic music. His 1972 album Catch Bull at Four spent three weeks at number one on the Billboard 200, and fifteen weeks at number one in the Australian ARIA Charts. He earned two ASCAP songwriting awards in 2005 and 2006 for \"The First Cut Is the Deepest\", and the song has been a hit for four different artists. His other hit songs include \"Father and Son\", \"Wild World\", \"Peace Train\", \"Moonshadow\", and \"Morning Has Broken\". In 2007 he received the British Academy's Ivor Novello Award for Outstanding Song Collection. In December 1977, Stevens converted to Islam, and he adopted the name Yusuf Islam the following year. In 1979, he auctioned all his guitars for charity and left his music career to devote himself to educational and philanthropic causes in the Muslim community. He was embroiled in a long-running controversy regarding comments he made in 1989 about the death fatwa on author Salman Rushdie. He has received two honorary doctorates and awards for promoting peace from two organisations founded by Mikhail Gorbachev. In 2006, he returned to pop music \u2013 releasing his first album of new pop songs in 28 years, titled An Other Cup. With that release and subsequent ones, he dropped the surname \"Islam\" from the album cover art \u2013 using the stage name \"Yusuf\" as a mononym. In 2009, he released the album Roadsinger, and in 2014, he released the album Tell 'Em I'm Gone, and began his first US tour since 1978. He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2014. His second North American tour since his resurgence, featuring 12 shows in intimate venues, began on 12 September 2016."@en ;

On the strength of her debut album in 1994, the Academy of Country Music (ACM) named her Top New Female Vocalist in 1995. Wright's first Top 40 country hit came in 1997 with \"Shut Up and Drive\". Two years later, her fourth album yielded a number one single, the title track, \"Single White Female\". Overall, Wright has released seven studio albums on various labels, and has charted more than fifteen singles on the country charts. As of May 2010, Wright's previous eight albums and 19 singles released had sold over 1,500,000 copies in the United States. In May 2010, Wright became one of the first major country music performers to publicly come out as lesbian. In television appearances and an autobiography, she cited among her reasons for publicizing her homosexuality a concern with bullying and hate crimes toward gays, particularly gay teenagers, and the damage to her life caused by \"lying and hiding\". She has written songs that have been recorded by Brad Paisley, Richard Marx, Indigo Girls, Mindy Smith and Clay Walker, among them Walker's top ten hit, \"I Can't Sleep\" that won her a BMI award. On May 4, 2010, Wright simultaneously released her memoir, Like Me, and her first album of new songs since 2005, Lifted Off the Ground. Wright's eighth album, I Am the Rain, was released on September 9, 2016 by MRI/Sony and was produced by Joe Henry."@en ;

Common debuted in 1992 with the album Can I Borrow a Dollar? and maintained a significant underground following into the late 1990s, after which he gained notable mainstream success through his work with the Soulquarians. In 2011, Common launched Think Common Entertainment, his own record label imprint, and, in the past, has released music under various other labels such as Relativity, Geffen and GOOD Music, among others. Common's first major-label album, Like Water for Chocolate, received widespread critical acclaim and tremendous commercial success.

Though nearly all of the Ramones' songs were credited equally to all the band members, Dee Dee was the band's most prolific lyricist and composer, writing many of their best-known songs, such as \"53rd & 3rd\", \"Commando\", \"Rockaway Beach\", and \"Poison Heart\". He was initially the band's lead vocalist, though his (then) inability to sing and play bass at the same time resulted in original drummer Joey Ramone taking over the lead vocalist duties (however, he still sang lead vocals in the band on occasion). Dee Dee was the band's bassist and songwriter from 1974 until 1989, when he left to pursue a short-lived career in hip hop music under the name Dee Dee King. He soon returned to his punk roots and released three solo albums featuring brand-new songs, many of which were later recorded by the Ramones. He toured the world playing his new songs, Ramones songs and some old favorites in small clubs, and continued to write songs for the Ramones until 1996, when the band officially retired. Dee Dee struggled with drug addiction for much of his life, particularly heroin. He began using drugs as a teenager, and continued to use for the majority of his adult life. He appeared clean in the early 1990s but began using heroin again some time later. He died from a heroin overdose on June 5, 2002."@en ;
