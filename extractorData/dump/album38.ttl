	dbo:abstract	"Flyleaf is the debut studio album by the American rock band Flyleaf. It was released on October 4, 2005 through Octone Records. A re-packaged CD/DVD special edition was released on October 30, 2007, which included additional acoustic tracks and music videos. The album was re-released on January 14, 2008 through Polydor Records in the United Kingdom, which included three additional acoustic tracks. Musically, Flyleaf is a Christian alternative rock and hard rock album with heavy influences of nu metal, emo and heavy metal. While the band's then frontwoman Lacey Sturm prominently sings, her unclean vocals are a frequent throughout the album. Lyrically, the album deals with topics such as Christianity, love and death. Flyleaf received mixed reviews from music critics, who commended its \"radio-friendly\" yet hardcore sound, but criticized its use of formula. It debuted at No. 88 on the Billboard 200, selling more than 13,000 copies within its first week. Due to the band's growing exposure to fame in 2007, it eventually reached its peak of No. 57 on the week of September 17, 2007, and spent more than 133 weeks on the chart. It also topped the Billboard Christian Albums chart, and has since become the ninth best-selling Christian album of the 2000s. It has sold more than 1 million copies to date, and was certified Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).[citation needed]"@en ;

dbr:In_the_Zone	rdf:type	schema:MusicAlbum ;
	dbo:abstract	"In the Zone is the fourth studio album by American recording artist Britney Spears. It was released on November 12, 2003, by JIVE Records. Its music incorporates dance, house, trip hop and hip hop styles with instrumentation from guitars, drums, synthesizers, strings, and Middle Eastern musical instruments. Its themes range from love, dancing, empowerment, and in the case of songs such as \"Touch of My Hand\", sex and masturbation. Contributions to the album's production came from a wide range of producers, including Bloodshy & Avant, R. Kelly, Trixster, Moby, Guy Sigsworth and The Matrix. With the conclusion of the Dream Within a Dream Tour in July 2002 and the end of her relationship with Justin Timberlake, Spears planned to take a six-month break from her career; however, work for In the Zone began later that November. She began writing songs for the album while touring internationally, despite not knowing the direction of the album. She experimented with different producers, trying to find those with whom she had chemistry. The first song recorded was \"Touch of My Hand\", which Spears claims set the mood for the album. She co-wrote all but four tracks, and often changed the lyrics to suit herself. Spears stated she was an autobiographical songwriter, although not to the point where she felt self-exploited. She also explained that the sexual nature of In the Zone was subconscious and happened while she was in the process of developing the album. Spears collaborated with artists such as Madonna in \"Me Against the Music\" and the Ying Yang Twins in \"(I Got That) Boom Boom\". In the Zone received generally favorable reviews from music critics, who complimented its mix of different styles and Spears's songwriting, but criticized her vocals for being distant and processed. Commercially, In the Zone became an international success, debuting atop of the charts in France and the United States, and peaking inside the top ten in fifteen countries. In the United States, she became the first female artist to have four consecutive number-one albums. In the Zone went on to become the eighth best selling album of 2003. Four singles were released from the album: \"Me Against the Music\", \"Toxic\" and \"Everytime\" met international chart success, all peaking at number one in Australia and Ireland and reaching top five positions elsewhere. To promote In the Zone, Spears performed the songs in a number of television appearances and also embarked on The Onyx Hotel Tour. The album and its music videos are largely seen by critics as the end of her transition from teen pop star to a more adult female artist. In 2009, Amy Schriefer of NPR listed In the Zone as one of The 50 Most Important Recordings of the Decade, calling it \"a primer on the sound of pop in the '00s\"."@en ;

The album marked Phish's return after a four year break, and also re-united the band with producer Steve Lillywhite, who last worked with Phish on their 1996 release, Billy Breathes. Noting that 2009 marked the band's 25th anniversary together, Rolling Stone described Joy's songs as something akin to \"a belated birthday party\" characterized by nostalgic, reflective lyrics that appear to be influenced by guitarist Trey Anastasio's struggle with drug abuse during the intervening years. Rolling Stone praised the album as \"genuinely great\" and \"a deeper trip than most Phish LPs\". The first single, \"Time Turns Elastic\"\u2014originally a multi-movement work for strings, guitar and vocals released as an album earlier in the year by Anastasio\u2014was released for iTunes-only download on May 26, 2009. The album's second single, \"Backwards Down The Number Line\", was released on iTunes and began radio rotation on August 17, 2009. Amazon.com released an exclusive live version of \"Backwards Down the Number Line\", recorded at Red Rocks during the band's summer tour, as a download-only bonus track. All ten songs were performed live during the band's 2009 summer tour, and have been generally well received by fans. However, \"Time Turns Elastic\" has been criticized as being too overly composed for ready translation to the live stage, and the album's nostalgic ballads are sometimes thought to dampen the energy of Phish's typically acclaimed live shows."@en ;

Kerplunk was their last release on Lookout Records and was also the first album to feature Tr\u00E9 Cool on drums. The album has gone on to be among the best selling independently released albums of all time. After debuting the album to their fans in the Berkeley, California area and receiving much approval from the critical 924 Gilman Street crowd, the band packed up in a cramped, converted Book Mobile and headed east. The band developed a fan base on the east coast behind the touring support of grassroots promotor, Jak Werz. The risk paid off as album sales reached over 50,000 copies. Along with the albums sales and the successful live shows, major labels took notice of Kerplunk's phenomenal popularity, as a result, many approached the band. Green Day realized that they had outgrown their record distribution capacity with Lookout! and eventually signed with Reprise Records. With Reprise, Green Day recorded and released their next album Dookie (1994). The album officially includes only 12 tracks, but the versions released on CD and cassette also include the 4 tracks from the Sweet Children EP. One of those tracks is a cover of The Who's \"My Generation\". The song \"Welcome to Paradise\" was re-recorded for Dookie. Like Dookie, Kerplunk was banned from certain stores because of the cover art. The cover features a mostly white picture (with some green added in) of a high school girl with a gun that has been fired. On the back cover, there is a boy lying on the ground with a gunshot wound on his back. As of November 2013, Kerplunk had sold 1,000,000 units in the United States and 4,000,000 units worldwide. In August 2005, Green Day pulled the album, as well as all of their other material released through the label, from Lookout! due to unpaid royalties. It was reissued on CD by Reprise Records, who Green Day has been with since leaving Lookout!, on January 9, 2007. In Europe, the album was released by Epitaph Europe, and has remained in print. It was reissued on vinyl on March 24, 2009 by Reprise Records and includes a reissue of the Sweet Children EP. There were no official singles released from the album, although \"2000 Light Years Away\" and \"Christie Road\" were released as mock-up singles in a Green Day singles box set entitled Green Day: Ultimate Collectors."@en ;

Before recording the album, the band was approached by Immortal/Epic Records after a performance at Huntington Beach, California. The band signed to their label because they didn't want to \"sign away all of their creative freedom.\" The band would record at Indigo Ranch Studios in Malibu, California with producer Ross Robinson, who also produced their 1993 demo Neidermayer's Mind. The recording took place from May to June 1994. After the recordings, Korn toured with Biohazard and House of Pain. The album's themes include child abuse, drug abuse and bullying. The album cover depicts a young girl being approached by a large man who is holding what appears to be a horseshoe or, more presumably, blades; furthermore, the girl's shadow gives the appearance that her body is being hanged due to the position of the band's logo. Photography was done by Stephen Stickler, and the design was directed by Jay Papke and Dante Ariola.

	dbo:abstract	"Late Registration is the second studio album by American hip hop artist Kanye West, released on August 30, 2005, by Roc-A-Fella Records. Recording sessions for the album took place over the course of a year at Record Plant Studios, Chalice Recording Studios, and Grandmaster Recording Studios in Hollywood, and at Sony Music Studios in New York City. West collaborated with American record producer and composer Jon Brion to produce Late Registration, and the album features guest contributions from artists such as Jay-Z, Common, Lupe Fiasco, Jamie Foxx, Nas, Brandy, and Adam Levine, among others. West's production for Late Registration was notably more lush and elaborate than his 2004 debut The College Dropout. By collaborating with Jon Brion, West was able to utilize production styles and instruments not commonly associated with hip-hop music, including intricate sampling methods and string orchestration. West still sought to deliver lyrics that allowed him to continue his style of storytelling during songs, and the album explores both personal and social issues, including poverty, drug trafficking, racism, healthcare, and the blood diamond trade.

	dbo:abstract	"Laundry Service (Spanish: Servicio de Lavander\u00EDa) is the fifth studio album by Colombian singer-songwriter Shakira, globally released on 13 November 2001 by Epic Records. It is her first album to be primarily recorded in English. After the release of her fourth studio album D\u00F3nde Est\u00E1n los Ladrones?, which became a success in Latin America, Shakira was encouraged by American singer Gloria Estefan to record songs in English as she believed the singer had the potential to crossover into the English-language pop market. Shakira was initially hesitant to undertake the project, but later decided to learn English well enough to be able to write songs in the language herself. The title of the album was chosen to reflect Shakira's views on love and music. It was also released as Servicio de Lavander\u00EDa in Hispanic regions in January 2002. Musically, Laundry Service is primarily a pop rock record but it also experiments with a variety of other musical styles, including Andean music, dance-pop, Middle Eastern music, rock and roll and tango. The lyrical theme of the album is mostly based around love and romance. Every song on the album was written and produced by Shakira. Six singles were released from the album. The lead single \"Whenever, Wherever\" became an international success and reached number one on record charts of countries like Australia, Austria, France, Germany, Italy and Spain. Follow-up single \"Underneath Your Clothes\" repeated its success, topping the charts of Australia, Austria, and Belgium. Both singles charted inside the top ten in the United Kingdom and United States. The third single \"Objection (Tango)\" became a top ten hit in most countries around the world. Spanish-language singles \"Te Dejo Madrid\" and \"Que Me Quedes T\u00FA\" performed well in Hispanic regions, becoming hits in Spain and on the Latin record charts in the United States, respectively. \"The One\" was a moderate commercial success and became the last single to be released from Laundry Service. Shakira embarked on the Tour of the Mongoose in 2002 and 2003 to promote the album. It was her first major worldwide tour and visited numerous countries and cities. Upon its release, Laundry Service received favourable to mixed reviews from music critics. Many critics complimented Shakira's incorporation of different musical styles in the production and her originality, while some critics argued that the album sounded too generic. Shakira's vocal talent also attracted praise. Laundry Service topped the charts of countries including Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada and Switzerland, while reaching the top five in other countries like Argentina, France, Germany, Spain and the United Kingdom. In the United States, Laundry Service peaked at number three on the Billboard 200 chart. The album received numerous record certifications in various countries, including quintuple-platinum certifications in Australia, Canada, Spain and Switzerland. It was also certified multi-platinum in the United Kingdom and the United States, proving to be a successful crossover for Shakira. Globally, Laundry Service was the seventh best-selling album in 2002."@en ;

Records and Machine Shop Recordings on June 20, 2012, in Japan, and throughout the rest of the world during the following week. Production was handled by vocalist Mike Shinoda and Rick Rubin, who both co-produced the band's previous two studio albums Minutes to Midnight (2007) and A Thousand Suns (2010). The band states that Living Things combines elements from their previous four studio albums to create a new sound. They stated they finally felt they were in \"familiar territory\" and \"comfortable in [their] own skin\" after years of experimentation that resulted in their two previous studio albums, Minutes to Midnight and A Thousand Suns. Living Things was chosen as the album's title because of the numerous personal topics on the album. It is the first album since Meteora to not have a Parental Advisory label. The lead single for the album, \"Burn It Down\", was sent to radio and released to digital music retailers on April 16, 2012. Living Things debuted at number one on Billboard 200 with sales of 223,000 copies in the United States in its opening week.

The album had a noticeable change in sound as producer Teddy Riley was mostly absent from this album, save for the song \"I Need Love\". MOV is also noticeable for being their first album with an all new line-up as original members Brian DeRamus, Corley Randolph and Desmond T. Greggs would depart from the group. They were replaced by Michael Jones, DeWayne Best and Anthony Fuller- formerly of the early 90's quintet Riff. They worked with producer Fred Jerkins III (brother of producer Rodney Jerkins) on MOV, who produced the first single \"Do You Feel Me (...Freak You)\". The song also appears in remix form as a ballad under the title \"If I Told You\". This album is notable for the song \"Miracles\", which was one of the final songs penned by singer-songwriter Kenny Greene before his passing in 2001."@en ;

My Iron Lung was originally released in EP form with all eight songs only in Australia, but it is currently in print worldwide. The record is seen as a bridge between the relative simplicity of their 1993 debut album Pablo Honey, and the greater sonic depth of Radiohead's later work, beginning with The Bends.

It was first released on 19 October 2011 by EMI, and later worldwide on 24 October. The band collaborated closely with acclaimed producer Brian Eno following their successful collaborations on Viva la Vida or Death and All His Friends, the band's fourth studio album. Mylo Xyloto is a concept album and a thematic rock opera. The album tells the story of a war against sound and colour by a supremeist government, set in the world of Silencia, an Orwellian society. Silencia has been taken over by a supremacist government, led by Major Minus, who controls the population through media and propaganda. His aim is to take sound and colour off the streets in hope to draw away \"feeders\", creatures that use such energy to hunt its prey. The album follows Mylo, a \"silencer\", who is one of an army tasked to hunt and track down \"sparkers\", people who harness light and energy and use it to create sparks, comparable to graffiti in real life. He comes across Xyloto, a sparker who is the most wanted by Major Minus. Through Xyloto, Mylo discovers his sparker abilities and his affiliation with the Car Kids, a major sparker faction founded by Mylo's parents Aiko and Lela. Drummer Will Champion has noted that the album is a story of the characters \"falling in love and trying to escape together\", with a general theme of \"love conquering all\". Internationally, Mylo Xyloto charted at number one in 34 countries. In the United Kingdom, Mylo Xyloto became Coldplay's fifth album to debut at number one, selling 208,000 units in its first week, and setting a one-week digital sales record with 83,000 copies sold. Mylo Xyloto broke an iTunes record for digital downloads sales by selling over 500,000 digital copies in a week. The album became the group's third to debut at number one on the US Billboard 200, selling 447,000 units in the first week. It was the UK's best-selling rock album of 2011, selling 908,000 copies. As of 2013, it has sold over 8 million copies worldwide. Mylo Xyloto received mixed-to-positive reviews from music critics, with a score of 65/100 on Metacritic. While some found it to be overproduced, others praised its uplifting tone and new electronic sound. \"Paradise\" and \"Every Teardrop Is a Waterfall\" received a total of three Grammy Award nominations in 2012, while the album and \"Charlie Brown\" received two further nominations in 2013."@en ;

The album features a host of guests, including Waylon's wife Jessi Colter and three artists then on Sony: Montgomery Gentry, John Anderson and Travis Tritt. The songs themselves are a mix of original Jennings hits, tracks from his more recent albums and compositions he had never covered. Like 1998's Closing in on the Fire, Never Say Die: Live reached #71 on the country charts.

Retaining the eclecticism, humor and psychedelic sensibilities of their adult work, the lyrical stylings are decidedly different: the darker themes of death and depression have been replaced with songs extolling the virtues of imagination, robots and sleep. The album declares itself TMBG's first album \"for the entire family\", with the intention that songs appeal to both young and old audiences. The album contains a cover of Vic Mizzy's safety song \"In the Middle, In the Middle, In the Middle\" sung by Robin Goldwasser. No! was released as an enhanced CD; while it plays normally in any CD audio player, it features a CD-ROM portion as well, providing the listener with interactive flash animations by the Chopping Block. \"The Edison Museum\" was originally written in 1991 and featured on the Edisongs compilation that year. The recorded version appearing here is largely the same as the Edisongs version, but has been slightly modified. The modified version here previously appeared on Long Tall Weekend in 1999. The largely positive reception the album received led to a collaboration with Walt Disney Records and the Disney Sound label. They released three albums through the mid-2000s, each with a theme: Here Come the ABCs (2005), Here Come the 123s (2008), and Here Comes Science (2009).

	dbo:abstract	"No Quarter is a live album by Jimmy Page & Robert Plant, both formerly of English rock band Led Zeppelin. It was released by Atlantic Records on 14 October 1994. The long awaited reunion between Jimmy Page and Robert Plant occurred on a 90-minute \"UnLedded\" MTV project, recorded in Morocco, Wales, and London, which rated highly on network television. It was not a reunion of Led Zeppelin, however, as former bassist and keyboardist John Paul Jones was not present. In fact, Jones was not even told about the reunion by his former band mates. He later commented that he was unhappy about Plant and Page naming the album after \"No Quarter\", a Led Zeppelin song which was largely his work. In addition to acoustic numbers, the album features a reworking of Led Zeppelin classics, along with four Middle-Eastern and Moroccan-influenced songs: \"City Don't Cry\", \"Yallah\" (or \"The Truth Explodes\"), \"Wonderful One\", and \"Wah Wah\". The album was #4 on debut on the Billboard's Pop Albums chart. Several years later, Plant reflected on the collaboration very positively:"@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Once in a Lifetime is a three-CD box set by the Talking Heads, released in the United States by Sire/Warner Bros./Rhino in 2003. The set also includes a DVD, an expanded version of the music video compilation Storytelling Giant. The discs are packaged in a wide horizontal book that recalls a CD longbox, featuring paintings by Russian artists Vladimir Dubossarsky and Alexander Vinogradov and with art direction by Stefan Sagmeister (for which he received a 2005 Grammy Award for Best Boxed or Special Limited Edition Package). Sagmeister would work with David Byrne and Brian Eno on their 2008 album Everything That Happens Will Happen Today. Only one previously unreleased song appears in this release: the Naked outtake \"In Asking Land\". This song was later completed by Byrne and released as \"Carnival Eyes\" on his solo album Rei Momo. Other non-album tracks are: \"Sugar on My Tongue\", a 1975 studio demo, dating from when the band was still a trio (minus Jerry Harrison); the 1977 single \"Love \u2192 Building on Fire\" and its B-side, \"I Wish You Wouldn't Say That\"; and two Naked-era songs - \"Sax and Violins\" (finished in 1991 for the soundtrack to the film Until the End of the World) and \"Lifetime Piling Up\" (finished in 1992 for the Sand in the Vaseline compilation). These non-album tracks had all been included on the 1992 compilation Sand in the Vaseline, though three non-album tracks (1975 studio demo \"I Want to Live\" and 1992's \"Gangster of Love\" and \"Popsicle\") remain exclusive to that compilation, in terms of CD releases. (Remastered versions of \"I Want to Live\", \"Gangster of Love\" and \"Popsicle\" were issued on the download-only release Bonus Rarities and Outtakes in 2006.) This box set marked the first CD release of \"A Clean Break\", a 1977 live recording from 1982's The Name of This Band Is Talking Heads. However, that album was remastered and reissued in 2004 as a two-disc set. Once in a Lifetime consists of four previously unreleased \"alternate versions\", three of which would later be reissued in various forms: \"Uh-Oh, Love Comes to Town\" and \"New Feeling\" are the original Tony Bongiovi \"pop experiment\" mixes, including brass parts and other more \"commercial\" production techniques that the band ultimately rejected; \"Cities\" is an alternate take that includes a verse not found on any previous official release; and \"Drugs\" is an early mix of the song, featuring Robert Fripp on guitar and very different production and instrumentation than the final version. \"Cities\" was reissued on the 2006 remaster of Fear of Music, while \"New Feeling\" and \"Drugs\" were reissued digitally on Bonus Rarities and Outtakes."@en ;

The album was recorded between 2011 and 2012 and was driven after the moderate success of their third album, Hands All Over (2010), and later by the enormous success of the re-released edition, which was promoted by the single \"Moves like Jagger\", recorded as a collaboration with Christina Aguilera. It is the band's only album not to feature keyboardist, rhythm guitarist and background vocalist, Jesse Carmichael, who took a temporary break from performing with the group to focus on his studies back then, but eventually returned to Maroon 5 in 2014. The band worked with different producers, such as Max Martin, who serves as the album's executive producer, Ryan Tedder, Shellback and Benny Blanco. The band's guitarist and Levine's usual co-writer James Valentine only has four credits on the album. The accompanying artwork, created by LA artist Young & Sick, is a colorful collage of illustrations seemingly inspired by the likes of Picasso and a range of modern cartoonists. Its title is a smirking allusion to Levine's ubiquity, while its sound is a reflection of how the group wishes to retain the large audience they won once again with \"Moves Like Jagger\". The album's lead single \"Payphone\", featuring rapper Wiz Khalifa, produced by Shellback and Benny Blanco, was released and performed on The Voice on April 16, 2012. The song was a success, reaching number two on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, as well as on the ARIA Charts, while it topped the UK Singles Chart, Canadian Hot 100 and Italian Singles Chart. The second single, \"One More Night\", was released on June 19, 2012. The song topped the Billboard Hot 100 for nine weeks, becoming their longest Hot 100 reign. All four singles released from Overexposed have reached the Hot 100 top-ten, including the last two of them: \"Daylight\" and \"Love Somebody\". The album received a mixed reception from music critics. Some praised the album, calling it their strongest effort, but others criticized the direction the band decided to take, calling it a failed attempt to go mainstream. Additionally, critics and fans alike perceived the album as overly focused on Levine. It debuted at number 2 on the UK Albums Chart, selling 38,000 copies, and on the US Billboard 200 chart, selling 222,000 copies. According to the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI), Overexposed was the 10th global best-selling album of 2012 with sales of 2.2 million copies,and sold approximately 3 million copies due to 2013. To promote the album, the band started the Overexposed Tour, which lasted from 2012 to 2014."@en ;

The recording sessions for Peregrine were held in Cannon Falls, Minnesota at Pachyderm Recording Studios. The sessions were produced by John Congleton, as opposed to their regular producer Ed Rose. The band returned from the studio later that year and began mixing and mastering the 13 new songs recorded for the album. Peregrine is the band's first album with new drummer Nathan \"Nate Jr.\" Richardson, formerly of The Casket Lottery, who replaced Josh \"Cobra\" Baruth. Lyrically, it brings the band back to the unified concept idea first explored on Mare Vitalis. The lyrics apparently tell the haunting story of Peregrine, a girl who is murdered by her father and who comes back to haunt him as a ghost. Musically, the album is a mixture of atmospheric, Low Level Owl-indebted instrumentals (\"Ceremony,\" \"An Orange and a Blue,\" \"The Clock and the Storm\"), tense, electronica-inflected songs (\"Mountain Halo,\" \"Woodland Hunter (Part 2)\"), driving guitar rock (\"February,\" \"A Fate Delivered\") and songs which return the band to their now-signature mixture of post-rock atmospherics with subtle arpeggiating guitar hooks and complex drumming (\"Sunlit and Ascending,\" \"Here We Are (Family in the Hallways)\" and \"Song 3.\") As such, Peregrine might be the Appleseed Cast's most eclectic release to date, while maintaining their distinctive sound."@en ;

As a result, Sabol's and Barretto's lyrics and vocal melodies and harmonies are still featured on the record.

	dbo:abstract	"Phantom Power is the sixth album by Welsh indie rock band Super Furry Animals, released on 21 July 2003 by Epic Records in the United Kingdom. The record was originally conceived as a ten song concept album using D-A-D-D-A-D guitar tuning, but the band chose to abandon this idea during recording as they didn't want to constrain themselves. The group did attempt to create a \"more coherent\" album than their past efforts by choosing songs which worked well together. Phantom Power was recorded at the band's own studio, AV Happenings, in Cardiff with the Super Furries producing and engineering themselves for the first time. The album features a range of musical styles, from country rock to techno, although many of the tracks are based around the acoustic guitar. According to chief songwriter and vocalist Gruff Rhys, the album's lyrics deal with \"broken relationships and war\". The album, like their previous record Rings Around the World, was simultaneously released on CD, vinyl and DVD. The DVD featured a surround sound mix of the album along with animations, commentary by Mario Caldato Jr. (who mixed the record) and remixes. The majority of these remixes were re-released as the album Phantom Phorce in 2004. Phantom Power was well received, with many critics suggesting it was the best album of the band's career."@en ;

On September 25, 2015, the band embarked on the Phases tour in promotion of the album. Appropriately, the tour only featured the versions of songs performed on Phases and did not feature the entire band, leading to departure rumors of keyboardist and unclean vocalist Zach Johnson and guitarist Jimmy Gregerson.

	dbo:abstract	"Physical is the ninth full-length studio album by Australian singer-songwriter Olivia Newton-John, released on 13 October 1981 by MCA Records. The album was produced and partly written by her long-time producer John Farrar. Recorded and mixed at David J. Holman's studio in Hollywood, California, Physical became one of Newton-John's most controversial and sexual records, and her most successful studio album to date. Musically, the album features considerable use of synthesizers and explores lyrical themes such as love and relationships, sex, kinesthetics and environmental protection. Upon its release, the album received generally positive reviews from music critics, many of them considering it to be Newton-John's best work. The album charted high in several countries, including the United States, Japan and Newton-John's native Australia, becoming one of the most successful albums of the early 1980s. It also ranks among the best-selling albums by Australian solo artists, selling more than ten million copies worldwide. The album's title track was a commercial phenomenon, staying ten weeks atop the Billboard Hot 100; at the time, this tied the record set by Debby Boone's 1977 single \"You Light Up My Life\". The song and its music video were controversial, having been banned or edited by several radio stations and television channels (such as MTV) for its sexual references. The single was followed by \"Make a Move on Me\", another top worldwide hit. \"Landslide\", which failed to enter the majority of musical charts, had a music video featuring Newton-John's boyfriend (and later husband) Matt Lattanzi, to whom she had dedicated the album. A video compilation, Olivia Physical, was produced, featuring music videos of all songs from the album. The material was a commercial and critical success, and earned Newton-John a Grammy Award for Video of the Year. The album was promoted with Newton-John's 1982 North American Physical Tour, performances from which a home video entitled Olivia in Concert was produced. The Physical era marked the height of Newton-John's solo career, gaining her wide acclaim as of the most successful female artists of the early 1980s."@en ;

After abandoning plans for a rock opera titled Songs from the Black Hole, Weezer recorded Pinkerton between songwriter Rivers Cuomo's terms at Harvard University, where he wrote much of the album. To better capture their live sound, Weezer produced Pinkerton themselves, creating a darker, more abrasive album than their 1994 self-titled debut. Cuomo's lyrics express disillusionment with the rock lifestyle; the album is named after the character BF Pinkerton from Giacomo Puccini's 1904 opera Madama Butterfly, whom Cuomo described as an \"asshole American sailor similar to a touring rock star\". Like the opera, the album contains references to Japanese culture. Pinkerton debuted at number 19 on the US Billboard 200 and fell short of sales expectations after the success of Weezer's debut. It initially received mixed reviews, but went on to achieve cult status and wide acclaim years later; the 2010 \"Deluxe Edition\" reissue holds a perfect score on aggregate review website Metacritic. The album produced three singles: \"El Scorcho\", \"The Good Life\" and \"Pink Triangle\". It is the last Weezer album to feature bassist Matt Sharp."@en ;

Co-produced by Greg Kurstin and frontman James Mercer, the album was released March 20, 2012 on Aural Apothecary and Columbia Records. The Shins' first studio album in five years, following the release of 2007's Wincing the Night Away, the band's fourth effort followed major lineup changes in the group: founding members Dave Hernandez (bass, guitar), Marty Crandall (keyboards) and Jesse Sandoval (drums) departed in 2009. Mercer deemed it an \"aesthetic decision\" to part ways with his bandmates, and in the interim, founded side project Broken Bells with Danger Mouse. Primarily a collaboration between Mercer and Kurstin, the album features contributions from former members, Dave Hernandez, Marty Crandall, Eric D. Johnson and Ron Lewis, alongside current drummer Joe Plummer, and other studio contributors including Janet Weiss and Nik Freitas. Mercer penned lyrics based around his newfound fatherhood and the love for his family, as well as nostalgic memories of his childhood in Germany and his rough adolescent transition to the United States. Musically, Port of Morrow is inspired by 1970s German pop and is melodic and heavily layered, while adding a greater emphasis on electronic instrumentation. The album debuted at number three on the Billboard 200 and received largely favorable reviews from contemporary critics. Several critics deemed it among the band's best, while others felt it disjointed following the departure of its principal members. Lead single \"Simple Song\" charted within the top ten on the alternative charts, representing the band's highest peak chart-wise. Upon release, independent record stores were exclusively given a bonus acoustic EP bundled with the record."@en ;

Present was the result. It consists of one disc of songs (plus an instrumental, \"Boleas Panic\"), and one disc of studio improvisations. The band had always improvised in the studio throughout their history, but never before (excepting the bootleg-quality Time Vaults), had these improvisations been officially released. In 2005, the band embarked on a successful reunion tour. Only two songs from Present, however, were played on the tour: \"Every Bloody Emperor\" and \"Nutter Alert\"."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Progress is an album released by Rx Bandits on July 17, 2001 through Drive-Thru Records. The LP was originally titled Artificial Intelligence and the Fall of Technology.[citation needed] The album was recorded during a tumultuous time in the band's lineup. Several members had left the band after the recording of Halfway between Here and There, though former saxophonist Noah Gaffney contributed on the song \"Anyone But You.\" Gaffney's position was eventually filled by saxophonist Steve Borth, formerly of East Bay ska-punk band Link 80. After the departure of James Salamone on bass, the band had many temporary replacements, including Johnny Tsagakis, drummer Chris Tsagakis' younger brother. Joe Troy, a longtime friend of Embree who helped write the song \"What If?\", eventually joined the band as a permanent bass player. Steve Choi, formerly of The Chinkees, also became a full member playing guitar and keyboards. Choi had also played keyboards on the demos that the band made for Progress, but when it came time to record, they decided to have Rich Zahniser of The Hippos play on the album, because at the time he was touring with the band. Former Jeffries Fan Club trombonist Chris Colonnier also played with the band at times in the same role as Zahniser. Progress was ranked #207 on the greatest albums in 2001. Shortly after the release of Progress, Chris Sheets joined as a second trombone player. Not long after that, Rich Balling quit the band. The album spawned the band's first music video for the song \"Analog Boy.\" The band wouldn't make a second music video for another 5 years, until the title track of 2006's ...And the Battle Begun."@en ;

Although the production was originally intended as another collaboration with Juan Carlos Calder\u00F3n, that plan was scrapped when Calder\u00F3n was unable to compose songs for the album. Facing a new-material deadline in his recording contract, at his manager's suggestion Miguel chose bolero music for his next project. Mexican singer-songwriter Armando Manzanero was hired by WEA Latina to co-produce the album with Miguel. Recording began in August 1991 at Ocean Way Recording in Hollywood, California, with Bebu Silvetti the arranger. On the album Miguel covers twelve boleros, originally recorded from 1944 to 1986. The first two singles, \"Inolvidable\" and \"No S\u00E9 T\u00FA\", reached number one on the Billboard Hot Latin Songs chart in the United States and spent six months atop the Mexican charts. \"Mucho Coraz\u00F3n\" and \"C\u00F3mo\" were in the top five of the Hot Latin Songs chart, and \"Usted\" and \"La Barca\" received airplay throughout Latin America. Miguel promoted the record with a tour of the United States and Latin America. The album was generally well received by music critics, who praised Miguel's singing and the record's production. The singer received several accolades, including a Grammy nomination for Best Latin Pop Album. Romance was a commercial success, selling over seven million copies worldwide. In the United States, it spent 32 weeks at number one on the Billboard Latin Pop Albums chart, and was the first Spanish-language album by a non-crossover Latin artist to be certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA); it was also certified gold in Brazil and Taiwan, firsts for a Spanish-speaking artist. Romance is the third-bestselling album of all time in Mexico, and the bestselling record in Argentina by a non-native artist. The album was noted by critics as reviving interest in bolero music. Its success encouraged Miguel to release three more bolero records: Segundo Romance (1994), Romances (1997) and Mis Romances (2001)."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Rush in Rio is a three-disc live album by Canadian band Rush, released on October 21, 2003. The album is also available as a two DVD set. With the exception of the last two tracks on the third disc, the album was recorded at Maracan\u00E3 Stadium in Rio de Janeiro on the final night of the Vapor Trails Tour. The other two tracks were taken from previous shows on the same tour. \"Between Sun & Moon\" was recorded at the Cricket Wireless Pavilion, Phoenix, Arizona, on September 27, 2002, and \"Vital Signs\" was recorded at the Colis\u00E9e Pepsi, Quebec City, Quebec, on October 19, 2002. The DVD was certified Gold in the US by the R.I.A.A. in December, 2003. As of September 2010, it has been certified 7x Platinum in the US with over 7 million copies sold. The track \"O Baterista\" was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Rock Instrumental Performance in 2005, but lost to Brian Wilson's \"Mrs. O'Leary's Cow\". Rush in Rio was the first live album released by the band to not follow the pattern of releasing a live album after every four studio releases, and was also the first to feature a complete setlist without any changes in song order, including Neil Peart's drum solo. It is also the band's first live album that presents a single night's performance in its entirety (not counting the two bonus tracks). In an interview about the album and DVD, Alex Lifeson and James \"Jimbo\" Barton noted that it took an extended amount of time to mix the sound. This was due to technical difficulties of recording the audio on primitive equipment. At this concert, Rush played to 40,000, their second largest crowd on the Vapor Trails Tour (the largest crowd was 60,000 at the show the previous night in S\u00E3o Paulo). In a rare departure from the band's practice of re-creating the sound of their studio work when playing live, the song \"Resist\" (on disc 2) was rearranged into a stripped-down acoustic version between Lifeson and Lee, with Peart sitting out after his drum solo."@en ;

Of special note are several early singles that have never appeared on CD in their original form: \"Ceremony\", \"Everything's Gone Green\" and \"Temptation\". Additionally, \"Confusion\" appears in an edit of the song's \"Rough mix\" created exclusively for this compilation. One song, \"Turn\" was released on this album in a new edited form, despite never being a single. Released at the very height of the loudness war prevalent in the record industry, this release is notorious amongst New Order aficionados for its high volume and heavy compression levels."@en ;

The record company, lacking resources, did little promotion for the album, which led to a complete failure to sell only 500 copies of an edition of 800, when his goal was to edit and sell 4,000. This was a big disappointment, but at least it allowed them to add performances (Festimad from 1996 to 1998, and Festival Internacional de Benic\u00E0ssim in 1996). Even with the disappointment of sales, they recorded their first video Come with me. Officially the album had no single but this song was the most demanded for at concerts by fans.

However, the label would not publish the record under any other name than Bruce Dickinson. The album moved even further away from the progressive sound of his former band Iron Maiden into an alternative rock sound similar to bands such as Soundgarden. However, the support tour for the album was the first time Dickinson included a song from his former band, a slightly reworked version of \"The Prisoner.\" Many of the songs lyrics are about science and technology. The band didn't last and for his next solo project, Accident of Birth, he teamed up again with guitarist Roy Z (from Balls to Picasso). The album was produced by Jack Endino, best known for producing Nirvana's first album. The album name refers to the code name for the military testing program. In 2005, Skunkworks was re-released and the 2005 extended version included songs performed live, such as \"Inertia\", \"Faith\", \"Innerspace\", \"The Prisoner\" and other previously unreleased songs."@en ;

Winning 5 out of 7 Grammy Awards, it was the most nominations that the band had garnered in their 24-year career. Kiedis attributed the album's success to less abrasive dynamics within the band, saying that the band's \"chemistry, when it comes to writing, is better than ever. There was always a struggle to dominate lyrically. But we are now confident enough in who we are, so everybody feels more comfortable contributing more and more valuable, quality stuff\"."@en ;

The single \"Feed the Tree\" became a #1 Modern Rock hit, and the album was nominated for two Grammy Awards. \"Slow Dog\" peaked at #17 on the Modern Rock chart in the summer of 1993, while \"Gepetto\" peaked at #8 in the late fall/winter of 1993. The album and group received two Grammy nominations in 1994 for Best Alternative Album and Best New Artist. The music video for \"Feed The Tree\" was a smash buzz bin MTV hit, and was nominated for Best Alternative Video VMA and Best New Artist VMA in 1993. Follow up videos for \"Slow Dog\" and \"Gepetto\" didn't have the same cross-over success, but were popular on Alternative and Rock segments and outlets of MTV and VH1. \"Feed the Tree\" also became a surprise pop hit peaking at #95 on the U.S Billboard Hot 100 singles chart in the late spring of 1993. Before breaking into the Hot 100 it was a chart topper on the Billboard Bubbling Under The Hot 100 singles for 6 weeks. While \"Gepetto\" did not match the success of \"Feed The Tree\" it charted on the Billboard Bubbling Under The Hot 100 Singles for 5 weeks in the late fall/winter of 1993 becoming a modest Pop hit and a signature song. \"Angel\" is not a rerecording of the song of the same name that Tanya Donelly wrote with Throwing Muses for their 1989 album Hunkpapa.

The tracks were played in a loop for many months, \"growing\" on many viewers to the point they called the cable operator to inquire about it."@en ;

dbr:Ten_Years_of_Harmony	rdf:type	schema:MusicAlbum ;
	dbo:abstract	"Ten Years of Harmony is an official double album compilation album released by The Beach Boys in 1981, and spanning their entire Brother Records-era up to that point, (1970\u201380), including some unreleased or rare material. Although the song \"Darlin'\" was recorded in 1967 while at Capitol Records, the version on Ten Years of Harmony is a live version, recorded in 1973 for the album The Beach Boys in Concert. The Beach Boys had more or less splintered in 1981. Far from lucid, Brian Wilson would occasionally appear on stage, primarily as a replacement for brother Carl, who was concurrently embarking on a solo career. Dennis Wilson would show up to occasional concerts, but would usually be argumentative and disruptive. Mike Love, Al Jardine and Bruce Johnston were the only stable members of a band who now had a whole cast of supporting musicians when they performed live. However, the release of Ten Years of Harmony kept the pretense going and, unexpectedly, the M.I.U. Album cover of \"Come Go with Me\" became a US top-twenty hit when released as a single from this collection. While taking tracks from 1970's Sunflower to the previous year's Keepin' the Summer Alive, the compilers also included some oddities, rarities, and unreleased tracks. First, a handful of the songs, namely \"Rock and Roll Music\" and \"California Saga: California\" are presented in their original single mix. Moreover, Ten Years of Harmony includes a 1979 A-side \"It's a Beautiful Day\" (which failed to chart), a Dennis Wilson-written track called \"San Miguel\" (which was a Sunflower-era outtake from 1969), a cover of \"Sea Cruise\", which was a rejected track from the 15 Big Ones sessions, and a selection from Dennis' solo album, Pacific Ocean Blue, \"River Song\". Only then-active Beach Boys (Al Jardine, Mike Love, Brian Wilson, Carl Wilson, and Dennis Wilson) appear on the gatefold cover on the original LP issue. The group vetoed the use of a photo with Bruce Johnston, who had rejoined the group in 1978 after a six-year absence, and also declined a suggestion that Johnston appear in an inset on the already-chosen photo. Ten Years of Harmony, now deleted, sold enough in its release to reach number 156 in the US."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"The Beach Boys Today!, also known simply as Today!, is the eighth studio album by the American rock group the Beach Boys, and their first of three 1965 releases. It peaked at number four on US record charts and was preceded by the top 10 singles \"When I Grow Up (To Be a Man)\" and \"Dance, Dance, Dance\", along with \"Do You Wanna Dance?\" which reached number 12. The album marked a major transition point for the band through Brian Wilson's sophisticated, orchestral approach. In December 1964, Wilson suffered through a nervous breakdown while on a plane, and was introduced to marijuana as a stress reliever. He then became a regular user after he realized the profound effect it had on the way he perceived music, subsequently resigning from touring with the group in order to focus solely on songwriting and producing. The tracks on the first half of Today! feature an electric guitar-rock oriented sound that contrasts the second half consisting of ballads, showing an increased mature lyrical depth that would foreshadow future efforts like Pet Sounds. The second side marks Wilson's continuing maturation as a recording artist; all the songs showcase creatively developed vocal & instrumental arrangements, complex Wall of Sound production, and lyrically introspective subject matter. In 2012, the album was voted 271 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the \"500 Greatest Albums of All Time\". In 2005, it was included in the musical reference book 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die."@en ;

It was recorded in Black Box, France by Stephen Fitzmaurice and David Odlum with assistance from Fabian Lesure. The front and back covers feature photography by frontman Hansard of oak leaves, accompanied by a handwritten inscription reading: \"Ni identitat permanent, ni idea de persona, ni d'\u00E9sser vivent, ni d'un temps d'exist\u00E8ncia\" (which is Catalan for \"Nor permanent identity, nor idea of a person, nor of being alive, nor of a time of existence\", from a work of Antoni T\u00E0pies).

Both \"Falling Slowly\" and \"When Your Mind's Made Up\" appeared on the 2006 album The Swell Season released by Glen Hansard and the Czech pianist Marketa Irglova.

Dev worked exclusively with American Electropop production duo The Cataracs, who helmed the production of the entire album along with co-writing songs with Dev. The production process of the album took place mainly in January 2011 and is currently continuing as the North American release date for the album was delayed from September 20, 2011 to January 10, 2012 as per Dev's request to add more songs to the album, however, Amazon.com announced the album would be pushed back again to March 26, 2012. The album received mixed to positive reviews, with critics commending the production of many of the songs while comparing the music on the set to the electropop stylings of American recording artist Ke$ha and Swedish dance recording artist Robyn. The songs are mostly inspired by Dev's life stories over the past few years. The Night the Sun Came Up is mainly an electropop and dance-pop album, which incorporates elements of several musical genres such as dubstep and urban. The themes of the album range from sex, partying, introspection, love and life. In the United States, the album reached a peak of number sixty-one, selling 7,560 copies in its first week of release. It also peaked at number 136 on the UK Albums Chart. The first two singles from The Night the Sun Came Up, \"Bass Down Low\" and \"In the Dark\", were both moderate international hits, with \"Bass Down Low\" peaking within the top ten of the UK Singles Chart. \"In the Dark\" was more successful in North America, peaking at number eleven on the Billboard Hot 100 in the United States and at number thirteen on the Canadian Hot 100 in Canada.

It is the band's first album to include Blaze Bayley, formerly of Wolfsbane, as vocalist, replacing Bruce Dickinson who left the band following their previous tour to pursue a solo career. The album takes a darker tone than the band's first nine releases, due to the lyrics being based on personal issues surrounding Steve Harris at the time, who was in the midst of a divorce. This is reflected in the cover artwork, which graphically depicts the band's mascot, Eddie, being vivisected by machine."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Think Tank is the seventh studio album by the English rock band Blur, released in May 2003. Jettisoning the Britpop sound of Blur's early career as well as the lo-fi indie rock of Blur (1997), Think Tank continued the jam-based studio constructions of the group's previous album, 13 (1999). The album expanded on the use of sampled rhythm loops and brooding, heavy electronic sounds. There are also heavy influences from dance music, hip hop, dub, jazz, and African music, an indication of lead singer-songwriter, Damon Albarn's expanding musical interests. Recording sessions started in November 2001, taking place in London, Morocco and Devon, and finished a year later. The album's primary producer was Ben Hillier with additional production by Norman Cook (Fatboy Slim), and William Orbit. At the start of the sessions, guitarist Graham Coxon had been in rehab for alcoholism. After he rejoined, relationships between him and the other members became strained. After initial recording sessions, Coxon left, leaving little of his presence on the finished album.Think Tank is a loose concept album, which Albarn has stated is about \"love and politics\". Albarn, a pacifist, had spoken out against the invasion of Afghanistan and, after Western nations threatened to invade Iraq, took part in the widespread protests against the war. Anti-war themes are recurrent in the album as well as in associated artwork and promotional videos. After leaking onto the internet in March, Think Tank was released on 5 May 2003 and entered the UK Albums Chart at number one, making it Blur's fifth consecutive studio album to reach the topspot. The album was later certified Gold. Think Tank also reached the top 20 in many other countries, including Austria, Switzerland, Germany, Norway and Japan. It was their highest charting album in the United States, reaching number 56 on the Billboard 200. The album produced three singles, which charted at number 5, number 18 and number 22 respectively on the UK Singles Chart. After the album was released, Blur announced a world tour with Simon Tong replacing Coxon as a guitarist. Think Tank was well-received critically, with a score of 83 on Metacritic, which equates to a tag of \"universal acclaim\". Several critics saw the album as timely, in part due to its being recorded in the Arab world where US and UK policies were unpopular. The album was nominated for Best British Album at the 2004 Brit Awards, and won the Q Album of the Year award. Since its release, Think Tank received a number of accolades listing it as one of the greatest albums of 2003 as well as the decade as a whole."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"The Today sessions were held in RCA's Studio C, Hollywood, Los Angeles, California, March 10\u201312, 1975, and marked the last time Elvis Presley would record in a studio. Elvis last recorded at Studio C, Hollywood in 1972 where he recorded the gold records \"Burning Love\" and \"Separate Ways\". At this time, Elvis was 40 years old. He was accompanied by his then-current girlfriend, Sheila Ryan. In the 2005 FTD TODAY release from these sessions, Elvis asked her to \"step up here Sheila, let me sing to ya baby\" on Take 1 of Don McLean's \"And I Love You So\". He continued to make \"And I Love You So\" and \"Fairytale\" a part of his live concerts until his death. On stage, he often referred to \"Fairytale\" as the story of his life. Today featured a new rock song, \"T-R-O-U-B-L-E\", which was released as its first single and went Top 40 in the US. \"Bringin' It Back\" was its second single in the US. The album also features covers of songs by Perry Como, Tom Jones, The Pointer Sisters, Billy Swan, Faye Adams, The Statler Brothers and Charlie Rich. \"Green, Green Grass of Home\" was released as a single in the UK, where it went Top 30, and also received US airplay. Elvis first heard the song in 1967 while driving his bus back to Memphis after making another movie, and heard Tom Jones' new single \"Green Green Grass of Home\" for the first time and loved it. He had the Memphis Mafia call the local AM station to make them replay it over and over again.[citation needed] Eight years later Elvis cut his own version."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Trouble is the second studio album by English recording artist Natalia Kills, released on 3 September 2013 by Cherrytree Records through will.i.am Music Group and Interscope. Recording for the album started in early 2012 and took place in Los Angeles and New York. During that time, Kills was accompanied by some producers including Jeff Bhasker, who served as Trouble's executive producer. Bhasker helmed a multitude of production tasks, including production, instrumentation and songwriting. Kills eschewed the sound and lyrical content of her debut album Perfectionist (2011) in favour of a heavier atmosphere, driven by strong percussion and electric guitars. The lyricism, largely co-written by Kills and Bhasker, explores the former's childhood and adolescence. Accompanying the album, its cover art was designed by Kills and symbolizes the album's main themes. Upon release, music critics commended the album's cohesiveness and perceived an evolution in Kills' songwriting. The album was announced with the release of a music video for \"Controversy\" in September 2012; since then, the album has been promoted extensively. Three singles were commissioned from Trouble, accompanied by respective music videos. \"Problem\" and \"Saturday Night\" preceded the album's release; later, a remix of the album's title track served as its third single. In addition to being interviewed by a variety of publications, Kills also performed live for some events. The record failed to chart internationally with the exception of the US Billboard 200, where it peaked at number 70."@en ;

True features collaborations with Adam Lambert, Audra Mae, Salem Al Fakir, Dan Tyminski, and Aloe Blacc. Guitarists Nile Rodgers and Mike Einziger (lead guitar of Incubus) appear on \"Wake Me Up\" and \"Lay Me Down\". Avicii said that sonically, the album would move away from his electronic dance and house music sound on previous records, by incorporating elements of other genres such as country music. True is preceded by the release of the Blacc-assisted \"Wake Me Up\" that topped several charts around the world, and \"You Make Me\", which features vocals from Swedish artist Salem Al Fakir. The album has been commercially successful, peaking within the top ten of at least ten countries. True debuted at number two in the United Kingdom during September 2013, and has subsequently re-peaked at number two in February 2014. On 24 March 2014, Avicii released a remixed version of the album, titled True (Avicii by Avicii).

	dbo:abstract	"True is the third album by American recording artist Solange Knowles, first released on November 27, 2012 digitally through Terrible Records. Following the release of her second studio album Sol-Angel and the Hadley St. Dreams (2008), Knowles announced that she had parted ways with Interscope Geffen A&M after releasing just one album on the label, and further revealed that she had chosen to go an independent route, eventually signing with Terrible Records. In 2009, Knowles began the recording of a studio album, during which she suffered a \"breakdown\" due to the amount of time and emotion she was putting into the recording process. A neo soul album, True contains an eclectic sound that takes influence from PBR&B, new wave music, dance, 1980s pop, and electronica, whilst the extended play's production is characterized as containing '80s references, keyboards and African percussion. The recording process took three years and was handled by Knowles and producer Dev Hynes. Together the pair produced, wrote and composed all of the songs, a decision Knowles made due to their chemistry, friendship and work relationship. Upon release True received highly positive reviews from music critics, who complimented its musical direction, particularly praising its individuality and '80s nostalgia; other critics compared the album to the work of Madonna. Commercially the EP saw little success, debuting at one hundred and fifty seven on the US Billboard 200 as well as charting within the top sixty of the albums charts in Denmark and Sweden. The album was promoted with the release of three singles including \"Losing You\" and was further promoted with a tour of the United States, United Kingdom, Netherlands, France and Germany."@en ;

Most of the songs have Phil Lewis on lead vocals, but the track \"Nothing Better to Do\" features Kelly Nickels on lead vocals, and \"Tarantula\" is instrumental. MC Bones drums on several songs. Lewis and Bones also played together in the band Filthy Lucre. Filthy Lucre bandmates Steve Dior and Jim Wirt sing backing vocals on several songs. Wirt was also the album's producer and engineer. After Bones left the band after recording, Steve Riley rejoined the band to tour for the album; it was the last time the classic line-up played together until 1999, Tracii Guns and Riley being the only classic members remaining after the tour. According to L.A. Guns folklore, Guns originally left the band prior to recording Vicious Circle. With Guns gone, the remaining members kicked around the idea of renaming the band L.A. Nickels, after bassist Kelly Nickels, before opting to keep the L.A. Guns name. PolyGram was completely unaware the guitarist had left the group. The record company would later threaten legal action against the group when they discovered Guns was missing during the recording process. As a result, Guns returned to the band to finish the recording of the album and subsequent tour. This whole scenario is probably what inspired the album's title: Vicious Circle. Which was defined in the album credits as: A situation in which the solution to each problem gives rise to another, eventually bringing back the initial problem."@en ;

The resulting album, Vs., featured a rawer and more aggressive sound compared with the band's previous release. It was the band's first collaboration with producer Brendan O'Brien. Pearl Jam decided to scale back its commercial efforts for Vs., including declining to produce music videos for any of the album\u2019s singles. Upon its release, Vs. set the record for most copies of an album sold in its first week, a record it held for five years. Vs. occupied the number one spot on the Billboard 200 chart for five weeks, the longest duration for a Pearl Jam album. The album has been certified seven times platinum by the RIAA in the United States."@en ;

dbr:Space_Ritual	rdf:type	schema:MusicAlbum ;
	dbo:abstract	"The Space Ritual Alive in Liverpool and London is a 1973 live double album recorded in 1972 by UK rock band Hawkwind. It is their fourth album, reached #9 in the UK album charts and briefly dented the Billboard Top 200, peaking at #179. The album was recorded during the tour to promote their Doremi Fasol Latido album, which comprises the bulk of this set. In addition, there are new tracks (\"Born To Go\", \"Upside Down\" and \"Orgone Accumulator\") and the songs are interspersed by electronic and spoken pieces making this one continuous performance. Their recent hit single \"Silver Machine\" was excluded from the set, and only \"Master of the Universe\" remains from their first two albums. The Space Ritual show attempted to create a full audio-visual experience, representing themes developed by Barney Bubbles and Robert Calvert entwining the fantasy of Starfarers in suspended animation traveling through time and space with the concept of the music of the spheres. The performance featured dancers Stacia, Miss Renee, Jonathan Carney (later of the V8 Intercepters) and Tony Carrera, stage set by Bubbles, lightshow by Liquid Len and poetry recitations by Calvert. On entering the venue, audience members were given a programme (reproduced on the 1996 remaster CD) featuring a short sci-fi story by Bubbles setting the band in a Starfarers scenario returning to Earth. The original release featured edits and overdubs, the sleeve notes explaining that \"We had to cut a piece out of Brainstorm and Time We Left because they were too long\", but the 1985 Space Ritual Volume 2 album contains the full unedited versions. A previously unheard edited version of \"You Shouldn't Do That\" (segued with an unlisted \"Seeing It As You Really Are\") from this concert was included on the 1976 Roadhawks compilation album, then subsequently included as a bonus track on the 1996 remaster CD. The full unedited version of the track can be found on the Hawkwind Anthology album. June 2007 saw another EMI remaster issue with different bonus tracks and DVD-audio. \"Sonic Attack\" had been written by science fiction author Michael Moorcock, who often performed with the band when convenient and Calvert was unavailable. Here it is recited by Calvert and it was scheduled for single release, promotional copies being distributed in a cloth sleeve, but it never did receive a full release. In the Q & Mojo Classic Special Edition Pink Floyd & The Story of Prog Rock, the album came #8 in its list of \"40 Cosmic Rock Albums\"."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Bloom is the second full-length album by British singer-songwriter Tasmin Archer, released on March 25, 1996. Archer started working on a follow-up to her successful debut album Great Expectations in late 1994, after the release of the Elvis Costello covers EP Shipbuilding early in the year. While continuing to work with her songwriting partner John Hughes, Bloom marked her first album without longtime collaborator John Beck, who played and co-wrote most of her debut album and left her in the middle of 1993. While her debut album had a plethora of producers, for Bloom Archer and Hughes settled with American producer Mitchell Froom. Recording of the album took place between December 1994 to May 1995, and was recorded at Real World Studios in England and Sunset Sound Factory in Los Angeles. Archer described the recording sessions as \"a very relaxed affair\" EMI Records, however, were not supportive of the material that Archer had recorded, deeming it too uncommercial and too removed from the sound of her debut album. Archer and Hughes had to fight for almost a year with EMI executives to get the album released in the form they wanted it to be. When it was finally released, EMI were still not very supportive of it and didn't push a marketing campaign as big as they had done with her debut album, which damaged sales of the singles and the album itself. When released, the album went fairly unnoticed, only peaking at #95 in the album charts, and the two singles released off the album did not enter the UK top forty. The album was released around Europe and Japan, but EMI America refused to release the album in the USA, and therefore Archer is seen as a one-hit wonder there. Archer, disillusioned with EMI, was let go of the label in 1997, and would disappear from the music scene for several years until returning in 2006 with her third studio album."@en ;

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mercy_(Planes_Mistaken_for_Stars_album)>	rdf:type	schema:MusicAlbum ;
	dbo:abstract	"Mercy is the third studio album by the American rock band Planes Mistaken for Stars released in 2006, and was the final album of new material before the band's 2008 disbandment. After several releases on No Idea Records, the band signed to Abacus Recordings \u2014 a short-lived heavy metal imprint of Century Media Records that also featured Ion Dissonance and Sick of It All. Guitarist Gared O\u2019Donnell commented on the transition between labels, stating: \"Right after Up in Them Guts [2004] came out, other labels expressed interest. We made the decision to do something different, and No Idea backed us up. They said, 'Listen, you've hit the ceiling with what we can do for you. If you want to go to another label for the next record, you have our blessing.'\" Mercy was produced by the Seattle-based producer Matt Bayles (Botch, Isis, Mastodon) and was officially released through Abacus on October 3, 2006. In 2015, Converge vocalist Jacob Bannon's hardcore label Deathwish Inc. reissued Mercy. This version was remastered by Brad Boatwright (Bane, Old Man Gloom, Code Orange) with the original 1/2-inch tapes and features revamped artwork and packaging. Upon release in 2006, the album was met with generally favorable reviews. Sam Sutherland of Canada's Exclaim! magazine said the album is, \"Gritty, unrefined post-punk that trashes around all over the lines that separate punk, hardcore, and good old rock'n'roll, Mercy is awash in spastic drumming, off-kilter riffs, and some of the finest throaty bellowing this side of Gainesville.\" Ned Raggett of AllMusic said, \"[...] the compelling impact of this album is not merely what it synthesizes but how it delivers the results \u2014 whatever their emo roots were, lumping these guys in with Panic! At the Disco would be pretty ridiculous.\" Among other tracks, both Sutherland and Raggett praised Mercy's opening and closing tracks, \"One Fucked Pony\" and \"Penitence\" respectively. Sutherland noted \"One Fucked Pony\"'s stylistic change from the band's usual screamo sound on past records to stoner rock similar to Kyuss or Fu Manchu set a tone for the record, while observing that \"Penitence\" was \"one of the most interesting sonic departures\" on the album. Raggett described Gared O'Donnell's vocals on \"One Fucked Pony\" as \"barking in a tortured but defiant rasp while the band finds a good intersection between sprawling boogie and tense, trebly riffs, not to mention just slowing down to a total crawl at the drop of a hat,\" and that the acoustic closer \"Penitence\" helped Mercy to \"seem like a massive epic.\""@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"The Wild Heart is the second studio album by the American singer-songwriter and Fleetwood Mac vocalist Stevie Nicks. Recording began in late 1982, shortly after the end of Fleetwood Mac's Mirage Tour. After the death of her best friend, Robin Anderson, and with new appreciation for her life and career, the recording took only a few months and was released on June 10, 1983, a year after Fleetwood Mac's Mirage. It peaked at #5 on the U.S. Billboard 200 charts (for seven consecutive weeks) and achieved platinum status on September 12, 1983. The album has sold over 2 million copies in the US alone, and has sold approximately 250,000 copies in the US since 1991 according to Nielsen Soundscan. The album is notable for its array of prominent guest musicians. Tom Petty made a return to write \"I Will Run to You\", on which his bandmates from the Heartbreakers performed. Nicks' Fleetwood Mac bandmate, drummer Mick Fleetwood, made an appearance on the track \"Sable on Blonde\". Toto's Steve Lukather contributed some of the guitar work on what would become the album's biggest hit single, \"Stand Back\", which also features an uncredited contribution from Prince, who played the synthesizer track. Nicks also worked with friend Sandy Stewart, who wrote the music for three tracks on the album and performed on several (Stewart would go on to write the 1987 Fleetwood Mac hit \"Seven Wonders\"). The album's final track, \"Beauty And The Beast\", features a full string section performing a score arranged and conducted by Paul Buckmaster. Nicks had recorded various other tracks prior to the album's release, including \"Violet And Blue\" which was featured on the movie soundtrack for Against All Odds, and later on Nicks' 3-disc retrospective box set Enchanted in 1998. The Wild Heart achieved double-platinum status in 1993, ten years after its release, for selling more than 2 million copies in the U.S. It spent a whole year on the Billboard 200 from June 1983 to June 1984. It was also certified Silver in the UK for sales in excess of 60,000. Three singles were released from the album: \"Stand Back\", which charted at number 5; \"If Anyone Falls\", which charted at number 14; and \"Nightbird\", which charted at number 33. \"Stand Back\" and \"If Anyone Falls\" featured accompanying videos that went into heavy rotation on MTV. \"Nightbird\", a track that Nicks has said was her favorite on the album, was performed live on Solid Gold and Saturday Night Live."@en ;

Initially, the album was scheduled to be released in December 2014 with Benny Blanco being the executive producer and the songs \"Baby Don't Lie\" and \"Spark the Fire\" being released as singles. However, after the underperformance of both songs on the charts and the writer's block Stefani suffered, she scrapped the whole record in favor of starting again. Inspired by the end of her marriage and the roller coaster of emotions she experienced during the time, Stefani returned to feel inspired and started writing new and meaningful songs. With the help of producers J.R. Rotem, Mattman & Robin and Greg Kurstin, as well as songwriters Justin Tranter and Julia Michaels, Stefani wrote the whole album in a few months and described it as a \"breakup record\", with the songs having a \"sarcastic\" and dark-humor vibe, as well as being real, joyful, and happy. The album's official lead single, \"Used to Love You\", was released on October 20, 2015, to a positive response from critics and a moderate impact on the charts.

dbr:Wonderwall_Music	rdf:type	schema:MusicAlbum ;
	dbo:abstract	"Wonderwall Music is the soundtrack album to the 1968 film Wonderwall, and the debut solo release by English musician George Harrison. It was the first album to be issued on the Beatles' Apple record label, and the first solo album by a member of that band. The songs are all instrumental pieces, except for occasional non-English vocals, and a slowed-down spoken word segment on the track \"Dream Scene\". Harrison recorded the album between November 1967 and February 1968, with sessions taking place in London and the Indian city of Bombay. Following his Indian-styled compositions for the Beatles since 1966, he used the film soundtrack to further promote Indian classical music by introducing rock audiences to musical instruments that were relatively little-known in the West \u2013 including shehnai, sarod and santoor. Harrison's main collaborator on the project was classical pianist and orchestral arranger John Barham, while other contributors include Indian classical musicians Aashish Khan, Shivkumar Sharma, Shankar Ghosh and Mahapurush Misra. Harrison also recorded Western rock music selections for the album, which feature contributions from Tony Ashton and the latter's band, the Remo Four, as well as guest appearances from Eric Clapton, Ringo Starr and Peter Tork. During the sessions, Harrison recorded many other pieces that appeared in Wonderwall but not on the soundtrack album, and the Beatles' song \"The Inner Light\" also originated from his time in Bombay. Although the album's release in November 1968 marked the end of Harrison's direct involvement with Indian music, it inspired his later collaborations with Ravi Shankar, including the 1974 Music Festival from India. The album cover consists of a painting by American artist Bob Gill in which, as in director Joe Massot's film, two contrasting worlds are separated by a wall, with only a small gap allowing visual access between them. Harrison omitted his name from the list of performing musicians, leading to an assumption that he had merely produced and arranged the music; the 2014 reissue of Wonderwall Music recognises his contributions on keyboards and guitar. The album was first remastered for CD release in 1992, for which former Apple executive Derek Taylor supplied a liner-note essay. While viewed as something of a curiosity by rock music critics, Wonderwall Music is recognised for its inventiveness in fusing Western and Eastern sounds, and as being a precursor to the 1980s world music trend. The album's title inspired that of Oasis' 1995 hit song \"Wonderwall\", and its music influenced the sound of Oasis' fellow Britpop band Kula Shaker. Harrison's full soundtrack for the film was made available on DVD in early 2014, as part of the two-disc Wonderwall Collector's Edition. In September that year, the album was reissued in remastered form as part of the Apple Years 1968\u201375 Harrison box set, with the addition of three bonus tracks."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"ZZ Top's First Album is the first studio album by the American rock band ZZ Top. It was produced by manager Bill Ham, and was released on January 16, 1971, on London Records. Establishing their attitude and humor, ZZ Top incorporated boogie, hard rock, heavy metal and Southern rock influences into their sound. Thematically, the album is lively, playful and at times brash, filled with the band's personal experiences and sexual innuendos that became central to the group's image. Seeking inspiration from Fleetwood Mac, ZZ Top began recording the album at Robin Hood Studios in Tyler, Texas. Only one single was released from the album and failed to appear on the Billboard charts. In 1987, this album was remixed for CD release. In 2013, the original vinyl mix was released on HD Tracks in high-resolution digital download formats. The original mix of the album was released on CD in June 2013 as part of the box set The Complete Studio Albums (1970-1990)."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"All for You is the seventh studio album by American recording artist Janet Jackson. Released on April 24, 2001 by Virgin Records America, its development and theme was rooted in Jackson's separation from husband Ren\u00E9 Elizondo, Jr, experiencing dating for the first time. Unlike The Velvet Rope, which saw Jackson tackling darker issues such as domestic violence and depression, All for You showcased an upbeat dance-pop sound, incorporating rock, house, and funk, as well as soft rock and Oriental music. Its lyrics focus on passion, romance, and intercourse, also discussing themes of betrayal and deceit. The explicit language and sexual content of several songs drew media controversy, causing the album to be banned in several countries. All for You was well received by music critics, who commended its upbeat nature and the sonic innovation of several songs. It was also considered one of her sexiest albums and among the best of her career. The album received three Grammy Award nominations, including Best Pop Vocal Album, winning Best Dance Recording for its title track. It became Jackson's fifth consecutive album to top the Billboard 200 albums chart in the United States and had the biggest opening week sales of her career. Upon its release, it also had the second highest first week sales for a female artist in Nielsen SoundScan history. It reached the top five of most countries internationally and was the biggest selling international album of the year in Japan. Lead single \"All for You\" became one of Jackson's most successful singles and broke multiple airplay records. It was the biggest hit of the year, peaking atop the Billboard Hot 100 for seven weeks. \"Someone to Call My Lover\" also achieved success, reaching number three and within the top ten and twenty in many countries internationally, while \"Son of a Gun\" attained moderate success. \"Come On Get Up\" was released as a promotional single in Japan. Jackson's 2000 hit single \"Doesn't Really Matter\" taken from the soundtrack of the comedy film The Nutty Professor II: The Klumps was also included in the album's track list. The album campaign was ended prematurely following financial losses from other artists on the Virgin label, despite its success. All for You was the year's twelfth biggest selling album worldwide. In support of the release, Jackson embarked on the All for You Tour, which ranked her as the year's third most successful touring act. In promotion for the album, Jackson was declared MTV's inaugural icon, receiving a televised tribute titled MTV Icon: Janet Jackson. The special honored Jackson's legacy within music and popular culture, in recognition of \"one of the most influential and beloved tastemakers in contemporary pop.\" Jackson was presented numerous career accolades, including the American Music Award's Award of Merit, TMF Award's Lifetime Achievement Award, and Recording Academy's Governor's Award."@en ;

The album produced a hit single in \"Riding with Private Malone\", which reached number 2 on the Billboard country charts and #36 on the Billboard Hot 100, becoming his first Top 40 hit since \"Look What Followed Me Home\" in 1995. Despite the success of the lead-off single, however, neither of the two follow-ups \u2014 \"She Always Talked About Mexico\" and \"Whenever You Come Back to Me\" \u2014 charted.

The album and subsequent tour were very successful in Europe where it went Platinum on sales of more than one million copies and Gold in Australia with more than 35,000 sales.

	dbo:abstract	"Argus is the third album by the rock band Wishbone Ash. It is the most popular Wishbone Ash album and widely considered their greatest by fans and reviewers. It was named \"Album of the Year\" in the 1972 year-end issue of Sounds magazine. The album features a blend of progressive rock, folk, and hard rock, and is considered a landmark album in the progression of twin-lead guitar harmonisation later adopted by bands such as Thin Lizzy and Iron Maiden. The sound engineer on Argus was Martin Birch, who also worked with Deep Purple, later with Black Sabbath, Iron Maiden and other hard rock bands. The bulk of the melodies and lyrics were provided by bassist/lead vocalist Martin Turner, although all members contributed to the song arrangements. With the success of Argus, the band also became one of the most popular live attractions of the day. In 2002, an expanded CD was released, featuring a remix (by Martin Turner) of the original album as well as 3 live tracks from the EP Live from Memphis promotional EP, recorded in the studios of WMC-FM. In 2007, a deluxe edition was released. This included the 1972 mix as well as additional BBC Session tracks. In 2008, Martin Turner's Wishbone Ash released a new studio recording of Argus. Andy Powell's incarnation of Wishbone Ash also released its own live version of the album entitled Argus \"Then Again\" Live. Martin Turner's Wishbone Ash played the entire piece live for the first time in February 2008 \u2013 the first time any incarnation of the band had done so \u2013 and embarked on a lengthy Argus tour.

Frontman Augeri's vocal work retained a closely similar sound to that of the aforementioned Perry.

	dbo:abstract	"Atom Heart Mother is the fifth studio album by English progressive rock band Pink Floyd. It was released by Harvest and EMI Records 2 October 1970 in the UK, and by Harvest and Capitol on 10 October 1970 in the US. It was recorded at Abbey Road Studios in London, England, and was the band's first album to reach number 1 in the UK, while it reached number 55 in the US chart, eventually going gold there. A remastered CD was released in 1994 in the UK and the United States, and again in 2011. Ron Geesin, who had already influenced and collaborated with Roger Waters, made a notable contribution to the album and received a then-rare outside songwriting credit. This was the first Pink Floyd album to be specially mixed for four-channel quadraphonic sound as well as conventional two-channel stereo. The SQ quadraphonic mix was released on LP in a matrix format compatible with standard stereo record players. There was also a release of the quadraphonic version in the UK in fully discrete four-channel form on the \"Quad-8\" format, a four-channel variant of the stereo 8-track tape cartridge. The cover was designed by Hipgnosis, and was significant in that it was the first one to not feature the band's name on the cover, or contain any photographs of the band anywhere. This was a trend that would continue on subsequent covers throughout the 1970s and beyond. Although it was commercially successful on release, the band, particularly Waters and David Gilmour, have expressed several negative opinions of the album in more recent years. Nevertheless, it remained popular enough for Gilmour to perform the title track with Geesin in 2008."@en ;

Emma Gaze explained the album was recorded \"the way we rehearse and practise: we all stand in a circle and it is very relaxed. Our previous recording experiences have been with the bass in one room, the drums in a different room, the two guitarists in a different room and then the vocals are done afterwards. Obviously it works like that because that is how most bands do it. But we just wanted it to sound more live; there is a different kind of energy that comes from playing in the same room.\" Verity Susman said that \"We see the record as a continuous piece of music, not a collection of songs. It also reflects the way we improvise, moving from one idea to the next without a clear break. It\u2019s also how we play live.\" The album was released on 9 May 2005 to mixed, but generally positive reviews.

In the United States, it was distributed by C2 Records, as part of a then newly signed distribution deal between Xtravaganza and the now defunct imprint of Columbia Records. The album is described by Bracegirdle in the liner notes as a reflection on \"a year in the life of Chicane\". The lead single, \"Saltwater\" was released in 1999, and became a club hit, like Chicane's previous hit \"Offshore\". The song included new version of the vocals from Clannad's \"Theme from Harry's Game\" provided by the original singer, M\u00E1ire Brennan. Other singles included the dance hit, \"Don't Give Up\" (#1 in UK) with Bryan Adams's vocals, \"Autumn Tactics\", \"No Ordinary Morning\" and \"Halcyon\". The collaboration with Adams followed a remix by Bracegirdle of one of Adams' songs."@en ;

It was his last album to be released under the name John Cougar Mellencamp, a combination of his real name and his original stage name of Johnny Cougar. The album peaked at number seven on the Billboard 200 and contained the singles \"Pop Singer\" and \"Jackie Brown,\" which peaked at No. 15 and 48, respectively, on the Billboard Hot 100. A re-mastered version of the album was released on May 24, 2005, and contains a bonus acoustic version of \"Jackie Brown.\" Like The Lonesome Jubilee, Big Daddy is folk-inspired as violins and fiddles (among other instruments) are significantly utilized on a number of tracks. The album's lyrics largely take a serious tone and the album as a whole is regarded by some as Mellencamp's most reflective. In 1991, Mellencamp said: \"'Big Daddy' was the best record I ever made. Out of my agony came a couple of really beautiful songs. You can't be 22 years old and had two dates and understand that album.\""@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Catch as Catch Can is the third studio album by Kim Wilde, released in autumn 1983. Having toured the UK and Europe in November and December 1982, there was a silence of six months. Kim Wilde returned with the single \"Love Blonde\", a jazz/swing-inspired track that lyrically mocked the blonde bombshell image that some media had dealt Kim in the previous years. But the sound was unique to the single; the rest of the album continued the electronic theme that was introduced on Select. Most of the songs were again written by Marty and Ricky Wilde, except the second single Dancing In The Dark, which was written by Nicky Chinn and Paul Gurvitz. Ricky Wilde produced the album. Some of the songs seemed to be telling a story (\"House of Salome\" [released as a single in selected countries], \"Sing It Out for Love\") whereas \"Dream Sequence\" was one of Marty's more imaginative lyrics, describing what seems to be a random sequence of images.The cool blue cover image was provided by photographer Sheila Rock. The album suffered from mixed reviews in the press and the lack of successful singles. Even a second European tour couldn't help the decline in sales. At the time of release, the new compact disc format was introduced. In Japan, the album was released on this new format. In later years, this release became a much sought-after item among Kim Wilde fans, who often paid more than $100 to get their hands on a copy. Elsewhere in the world, the album has been released on CD only once, as part of a 3-CD box set named The Originals (1995). Available for a limited period only, this also has become a collectable item. It was finally re-released on May 18, 2009 as a remastered special edition following Kim Wilde and Select in April."@en ;

Cowboy was produced by Gareth Jones and Neil McLellan and marked the band's return to more simplistic three-minute synthpop music. After disappointing sales and chart placing of their last studio album Erasure, Cowboy returned the duo to the Top 10 of the UK album chart and it contained three singles (two of which hit the UK Top 30). In the U.S., Cowboy greatly improved Erasure's Billboard 200 peak over their previous album and first single \"In My Arms\" gave them another Hot 100 entry. Sales also improved in Germany, where Cowboy peaked at number thirty-four. The album contained eleven Vince Clarke/Andy Bell originals in its UK version. For its U.S. release, the album artwork was changed slightly, the original version of \"In My Arms\" was replaced with a slightly-different US mix and two bonus tracks were added: a cover version of Blondie's \"Rapture\" (with Clarke providing the rap); and a version of the Burt Bacharach/Hal David song \"Magic Moments\" that Erasure had contributed to the Lord of Illusions soundtrack. Erasure embarked on another major tour of the UK and U.S. to promote this album, in their trademark style it contained elaborate stage settings and costumes (including Clarke dressed as a guitar-playing cactus)."@en ;

The album was written, according to frontman Toby Driver, as a single, narrative-driven, long-form composition written with story and text provided by a close, terminally-ill friend of the band, Yuko Sueta, in the final stage of her life. Coyote was once again engineered by Randall Dunn (Sunn O))), Earth, Six Organs of Admittance, Wolves in the Throne Room) in Seattle, Washington, forging a new genre of \"goth fusion\" which combines elements of early Cure, Faith and the Muse, and Bauhaus with Herbie Hancock's psychedelic album, Sextant, and Scott Walker's recent album, The Drift. The lyrics and story were constructed with deliberate melodrama to pay homage as well to the intended gothic vibe, expressing the protagonist's loneliness and longing to be in a better place, and her journey through her own personal looking-glass through a hallucinatory world of fear and wonder. The album received mixed reviews and would be the band's final release on Hydra Head. The album is much gloomier and electronic, paying homage to gothic post-punk and gothic rock bands with influences of chamber music as well."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Fuego is an album by the American rock band Phish. Released on June 24, 2014, it was their twelfth official studio album and their first in five years, since 2009's Joy. The album is a mix of rock, soul, reggae and bluegrass. Fuego was recorded in late 2013 in Nashville, Tennessee after a series of writing sessions at the Barn in Vermont and was produced by Bob Ezrin (Pink Floyd, Lou Reed, Peter Gabriel). While Fuego's ten new tracks include songs that individual members brought to the table in usual Phish fashion, the bulk of the material was written by all four, working together at the Barn, often writing in a stream-of-consciousness style. In a playful spin on Phish's tradition of musical costumes, the band debuted eight songs from the album on October 31, 2013 as the second set of their Halloween concert at Boardwalk Hall in Atlantic City, New Jersey. The original working title of the album was Wingsuit, but in May 2014 Phish announced that the album would be called Fuego. Ultimately, three songs included in the Halloween performance debut didn't make it onto the studio version: \"Snow\", \"Amidst the Peals of Laughter\", and \"You Never Know\". \"Halfway to the Moon\" made its live debut in 2010 and \"Winterqueen\" was debuted by Trey Anastasio Band in 2011, before Phish performed it for the first time at the 2013 Halloween show. One track, \"Waiting All Night\", was released on NPR's website on May 14, 2014, along with a complete track listing of the album. A second song, \"The Line\", was released online for streaming on May 27, 2014, and a third, \"555\", was released on YouTube on June 12, 2014.

	dbo:abstract	"I Am... is the fourth full-length studio album by Japanese pop singer Ayumi Hamasaki, released on January 1, 2002 in Japan by Avex Trax. The album marked an evolution in Hamasaki's lyrical and musical style: Hamasaki, who wrote all the lyrics on I Am... as with her previous albums, began to move away from the themes of \"loneliness and confusion\" that had marked her previous albums and began to incorporate elements of rock music in her songs. Unlike her previous albums, Hamasaki also acted as one of the composers on I Am..., composing twelve of its sixteen songs under the pen name \"Crea\". Moved by the September 11, 2001 attacks, Hamasaki sought to write less introspectively than she had on previous effort Duty, and incorporate lyrics that were more for all people than simply herself. This is apparent in songs such as \"Unite!\" and \"A Song Is Born\". I Am... was promoted with the release of eight singles, and one international single. Lead single \"M\" topped the charts in Japan and sold over a million copies; it also won \"Song of the Year\" at the Japan Gold Disc Awards. \"M\" is considered one of Hamasaki's signature songs, and was the first song of her career that she composed herself. Hamasaki also composed second single \"Evolution\"; it too peaked at number one and was a million seller. Third single \"Never Ever\" also found success, peaking at number one and selling over 750,000 copies. Of the next six singles, five would peak at number one, with the final single, \"Daybreak\", reaching number two. I Am... experienced commercial success. It debuted atop the Oricon with first-week sales of over 1.7 million copies; it would go on to sell nearly 2.5 million copies in its 25-week chart run. Her first international release, it was successful across Asia: in Singapore, I Am... sold over 10,000 copies, unusual for a Japanese album. I Am... has sold over 8 million albums and singles worldwide."@en ;

The album features an electronic based sound, differing from their previous pop-rock and acoustic releases, that was accented with the use of synthesizers, sampling, drum programming and vocal processing effects. The lyrical content of the album is centered heavily around heartbreak, which some critics noted its contrast to the electronic elements presented. Insomniatic was well received by many music critics, many of which lauded the duo for the lyrical depth and evolution. Others, however, label the composition of the album to be bland and unoriginal. The album debuted at number 15 on the Billboard 200 with sales of 39,000. Two singles were spawned from the album. The first single, \"Potential Breakup Song\", was released on June 26, 2007 and became charted within the top 30 in several countries, including the United States where it peaked at number 17. \"Like Whoa\" was released as the album's second single in early 2008 and charted in the lower regions of the charts.

	dbo:abstract	"Kaya is a roots reggae album released by Bob Marley and the Wailers in 1978. The album consists of tracks recorded alongside those present on the Exodus album in 1977. The album has a very relaxed, laid back sound, lacking much of the militant quality of the Wailers lyrically and musically. They received criticism for 'going soft' as a result of the general sound of the album as well as the theme: songs primarily revolving around love, as well as marijuana. The album's release coincided with the One Love Peace Concert, heralding Marley's triumphant return to Jamaica from exodus in London. Many of the songs present on this album, as well as its sister album Exodus, are rerecorded versions of older tracks present on the album \"Soul Revolution Part II\" and the \"African Herbsman\" compilation album. Well known songs from the album include \"Is This Love\" and \"Satisfy My Soul\". Kaya reached the top five in the UK album charts."@en ;

The first release came with the German edition (which is identical to the Swiss edition) on August 22, 2008. Fans in countries where Sony BMG operates national offices were given the opportunity to vote for songs from a list of Jackson's back catalogue to be included in their country's version of the album. Aside from the tracks selected by fans, a megamix of five songs from the Thriller album by Jason Nevins was also included in the pool. The album has been released in a total of 26 countries.

The title of another track on the album is based around some confusion. When it was put to Elliott in an interview that the track title \"Stone Cold Said So\" was a wrestler's catchphrase, Elliott admitted that he had had no idea; he had seen it written on a wall near a school and thought it was a teacher's nickname.

	dbo:abstract	"Live at Budokan is a live recording released by progressive metal/rock band Dream Theater on October 5, 2004, available on either 3 CDs, 2 DVDs, or 1 Blu-ray Disc. It was recorded at the Nippon Budokan Hall on April 26, 2004 in Tokyo, Japan. Due to time constraints, the songs \"The Great Debate\", \"Under a Glass Moon\" and \"Caught in a Web\", which included an extended drum solo, were removed from the setlist at the last minute. On the DVD, during the credits, the song \"Vacant\" is played in the background, without Labrie's vocals. According to the Commentary Track on their \"When Dream And Day Reunite\" Official Bootleg Live DVD during the first few minutes of the live concert Jordan Rudess had an equipment malfunction that played either the incorrect sound, no sound at all, or random notes 1/2-step upward in pitch. Nevertheless, Rudess mimed playing the correct parts as he realized they would have to be re-recorded in during Post-Production. The live DVD was re-released on Blu-ray, on October 18, 2011."@en ;

The two singles from the album, \"More Than This\" and \"Rainy Day\", were not originally intended to be included on the album at all. John Lombardo had just written \"Rainy Day\", which was deemed more radio friendly than the other songs, and the record company insisted that the band record a cover song for inclusion. The band chose to credit the songs as group collaborations so that all members would receive equal royalties. Ramsey and Lombardo shared the lyric writing. Ramsey wrote the music to \"All That Never Happens\". Lombardo wrote \"Rainy Day\", \"Even with My Eyes Closed\", \"Big Star\", \"Shining Light\" and \"Across the Fields\". Lombardo shared a writing credit with Jerry Augustyniak on \"Girl on a Train\". Rob Buck wrote \"Love Among the Ruins\", and Dennis Drew wrote \"A Room For Everything\".

The LP's original packaging included an 11 x 11\" booklet, with the songs' lyrics printed, calligraphy-style, on simulated parchment paper. For the first several pressings, the cover itself was simulated leather, and the Beatles' image (a re-working of Richard Avedon's 1967 portrait, featured in Look Magazine) was simulated gold-foil.

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Love_Songs_(Bee_Gees_album)>	rdf:type	schema:MusicAlbum ;
	dbo:abstract	"Love Songs was the third Bee Gees compilation album in four years, though the first to cover a specific musical style. A proposed album of love songs was in the works around 1995 when the Bee Gees recorded their own versions of \"Heartbreaker\" and \"Emotion\", but that project was soon shelved and those recordings remained unavailable until 2001. Following the success of the Number Ones compilation in 2004, Universal once again tried to mine the Bee Gees catalog, this time focusing on their ballads. Spanning their entire career, Love Songs features many of the group's big hits, but also includes some lesser known tracks such as \"Secret Love\" and \"For Whom The Bell Tolls\", which were both big hits in Europe. Also, included is a live version of \"Islands In The Stream\". The U.S. and the UK versions differed slightly in song selection and running time. Included in the UK version were 1993's \"Heart Like Mine\" and a song Barry and Maurice wrote together with Ronan Keating in 1999 called \"Lovers And Friends\", backing Keating both vocally and instrumentally while also producing the recording. Another anomaly was the inclusion of the Robin Gibb solo hit \"Juliet\" from 1983, which was a big hit in many countries, except in the UK and the U.S. By the time Love Songs was released, there had been several Bee Gees compilations on the market as well as their entire back catalog, so this release seemed somewhat redundant. In the U.S. it did chart but only managed to reach #166. In their homeland it climbed to No. 51 in the UK Albums Chart, but its best showing was in France where it went Top 20, peaking at No. 18."@en ;

Lucky himself had been mentioned on Green Day's first two albums, wrote a blurb in the art booklet for 1039/Smoothed Out Slappy Hours and was thanked in Kerplunk!. The album was filled with political songs, most notably ones like Stolen Life, where singer/songwriter Jeff Ott takes an anti police stance, and My Congressman and War On Drugs, which criticize the government for hurting drug addicts and non-violent drug users and accusing politicians for using them as a scapegoat and an excuse for \"genocidal\" campaigns (e.g. \"incarcerating all the homeless\"). Drugs would later become Jeff Ott's main focus as an activist, having been a drug addict for most of his life (starting when he became homeless around age 14)."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Mingus is the tenth studio album by Canadian singer-songwriter Joni Mitchell, and a collaboration with jazz musician Charles Mingus. Recorded in the months before his death, it would be Mingus's final musical project; the album is wholly dedicated to him. The album is quite experimental, featuring minimalist jazz, overplucked, buzzing acoustic guitars, and even wolves howling through \"The Wolf That Lives In Lindsey\". All of the lyrics are by Mitchell, while the music for four of the songs was composed by Mingus, three being new tunes, a fourth being his tribute to saxophonist Lester Young from his 1959 classic Mingus Ah Um, \"Goodbye Pork Pie Hat\", for which Mitchell wrote a set of lyrics. As with the release preceding, Don Juan's Reckless Daughter, Mitchell hired personnel from jazz fusion group Weather Report, notably bassist Jaco Pastorius to play on the sessions. Mingus would also mark the first reunion of saxophonist Wayne Shorter and pianist Herbie Hancock in the studio since recording together on Shorter's seminal Native Dancer album, featuring Milton Nascimento, released in September 1974. The album is spliced with excerpts, which are labelled \"(Rap)\", from recordings provided by Sue Graham Mingus, including a scat singing interplay between Joni and Mingus, and Charles and Sue arguing over his age at a birthday party. In \"Funeral\", Mingus and others discuss how long he'll live and what his funeral will be like. He refers to the Vedanta Society and asserts that \"I'm going to cut Duke [Ellington]!\". \"God Must Be a Boogie Man,\" having taken shape two days after his death, was the only song Mingus was unable to hear. Mitchell suggests in the liner notes that Mingus would have found it hilarious. The artwork features several paintings by Mitchell of Mingus. It peaked at #17 on the Billboard Pop Albums chart."@en ;

Since making her name as the biggest female star of the disco era in the 1970s, Summer had experimented with different musical genres throughout the 1980s with varying degrees of success. For Mistaken Identity, Summer adopted a more urban style. The first released single \"When Love Cries\", peaked at number 77 on the US Billboard Hot 100. Once again her vocal prowess is on display with tracks like \"Cry of A Waking Heart\", \"Friends Unknown\", and \"Heaven's Just A Whisper Away\". Before the release of the album, New York magazine printed an article about alleged statements Summer had made back in 1983, which cast her in a homophobic light. Summer, who had always denied making the statements, held a press conference in regards to the article printed, and again denied ever making the statements. She sued the magazine (50 million) for libel. The case was settled out of court but the damage had been done. The album was not a commercial success and failed to chart on both the US Billboard 200 and UK Albums Chart. It spent a single week on the US Billboard R&B Albums chart, at #97. Although \"When Love Cries\" did reach #18 on the Billboard R & B charts."@en ;

The lyrical themes on the album include the singer's personal experiences with love, monogamy, media bias, and maturity. Influenced by Mariah Carey and Whitney Houston, Norwood wanted to present a more mature facet of herself with the album, incorporating a ballad-heavy style and an adult contemporary feel into her urban-pop sound for the album. Upon its release, Never Say Never facilitated Norwood in becoming a viable recording artist with media\u2013crossing appeal.

After his completion of \"No Mercy\", he began to sell his cassettes in various stores and clubs, and performing for free in high school dances and private parties. After his mild success of \"No Mercy\", many producers and artists began to work with him, taking then the name \"Daddy Yankee\"."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"No Mercy is the seventh studio album by American hip hop recording artist T.I.. It was released on December 7, 2010, by Grand Hustle Records and Atlantic Records. Recording sessions for the album took place during 2009 to 2010. Production was handled by several high-profile record producers, including Kanye West, Polow da Don, The-Dream, J.U.S.T.I.C.E. League, The Neptunes, TrackSlayerz, Jake One, T-Minus, Christopher \"Tricky\" Stewart, Rico Love, Alex da Kid, DJ Toomp, Jim Jonsin, Danja and Dr. Luke, among others. The album also features guest appearances from several prominent artists such as Kanye West, Kid Cudi, Scarface, Chris Brown, Eminem, The-Dream, Trey Songz, Pharrell, Drake and Christina Aguilera. The album debuted at number 4 on the US Billboard 200 chart, selling 159,000 copies in its first week in the United States. It attained international charting and produced the lead singles \"Got Your Back\" and \"Get Back Up\". Due to violating his parole stemming from a drug arrest, T.I. was forced to alter things, including the album's intended bellicose tone and its title, from \"King Uncaged\" to its current namesake \"No Mercy\". Additionally, four purported singles failed to make the final cut. Upon its release, No Mercy received mixed reviews from most music critics. A vinyl edition of the album was released on February 22, 2011. The album was later certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA)."@en ;

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Not_of_This_Earth_(The_Damned_album)>	rdf:type	schema:MusicAlbum ;
	dbo:abstract	"Not of This Earth is the eighth studio album by The Damned. It is often (perhaps more correctly) called I'm Alright Jack & The Beanstalk. The album has a convoluted history. Following the Final Damnation concerts in 1988, the original line-up of the band (singer Dave Vanian, guitarist Brian James, bass guitarist Captain Sensible and drummer Rat Scabies) had briefly collaborated to record the track \"Prokofiev\", which had a low-key USA-only release on the independent Skinnies Cut label. Over the following months, Scabies continued to collaborate with James, Kris Dollimore, guitarist with The Godfathers, on demos. James soon moved on. Scabies and Dollimore then recruited bass player Moose (formerly with New Model Army), the trio travelling to Scotland to work on further demos. Initial attempts to persuade Vanian to join the project were unsuccessful, as the singer was dismissive of the demo songs. Scabies abandoned the material, and began working with Alan Lee Shaw (who had previously played guitar for The Rings, The Maniacs, The Physicals and Brian James' band Brains). This time the new material progressed further, Dollimore rejoined the project and a number of bassists were auditioned before Moose returned. Alternative singers were suggested (including recent Take That departed Robbie Williams, and Joe Strummer) before Vanian was contacted again. Vanian reversed his original decision and completed the new line-up as singer. A period of rehearsal followed, and the new band debuted at The Dome in Tufnell Park under the monicker The Damagement. At this point the decision was taken to revert to The Damned banner. The new line-up performed a BBC Radio 1 session in November 1993, and then toured the UK, U.S. and Japan. The group's recordings had built a cult following in Japan, and following excellent reception of the new material at the gigs there, Toshiba offered the group the funding to record it as an album. Recording took place at the late Connie Plank's studio in Germany, before additional tracks were overdubbed at the Storeroom back in the UK. None of the Scabies/Dollimore material was used, all songs coming from Scabies/Shaw (as a side-note, Scabies is listed under his real name of Chris Millar in the writing credits). James Taylor of James Taylor Quartet fame added Hammond organ to some tracks, while ex-Sex Pistols bass player Glen Matlock played on \"Tailspin\" and part of \"Never Could Believe\".The results were issued by Toshiba as Not of This Earth in Japan in November 1995, with a remix of \"Prokofiev\" as an unlisted 'hidden' track. In April 1996, the Marble Orchard label issued the album in the UK, now titled I'm Alright Jack & the Beanstalk (inspired by a phrase used by an acquaintance of Scabies'). This had apparently been the planned title of the album all along, but had been considered too much of a mouthful for the Japanese market. The cover was a 3D lenticular design, using the Japanese artwork as a background for a risqu\u00E9 animation. This version of the album was also issued in Germany and Sweden. The album also saw a release in the USA in 1996, but this release, on the Cleopatra label, was titled Not of This Earth once again, and featured totally different cover artwork.By this time, the new line-up was breaking up. Vanian wanted to continue touring to cover the costs of his divorce, and was performing with his Phantom Chords project. Scabies was less keen to continue saturating their live work, fearing playing to smaller audiences. The pair also disagreed over the writing of the album. A proposed tour of small venues was shelved, apart from a one-off show at Plymouth Cooperage, the line-up's final live performance. The band split in August of 1995, and by August 1996 would be reforming once more \u2013 this time with Vanian accompanied by Captain Sensible instead of Scabies. The Vanian/Scabies/Shaw/Dollimore/Moose line-up have featured on two other Damned releases \u2013 the remix EP Testify and the live album Molten Lager. Much confusion has sprung up about the Not of This Earth/I'm Alright Jack & the Beanstalk album. The Damned's official site formerly carried the unhelpful message \"Not intended for release in this form\" on its discography page on the album, and the music press often referred to 2001's Grave Disorder as the group's first release since Anything in 1986. Several sources list it as a compilation album. To further the confusion about the album's name, Castle Music reissued it as I'm Alright Jack & the Beanstalk in the USA in 2002, with Imperial doing the same in Japan. Recently, thanks to the ease of importing CDs and the rise of internet shopping, copies of the US release of Not of This Earth can be easily found in Europe, with Cleopatra also reissuing the album in The Damned Box Set in 1999 (with the Testify remix EP, and compilation The Chaos Years). The Castle release (also reissued in the UK in 2002) featured a non-lenticular sleeve based on the original Japanese artwork, and also included the four tracks cut at the 29 November 1993 Radio 1 session as bonus tracks."@en ;

Regarding the album, guitarist Chris Connick stated that the album features \"ten tracks of misery and place, from Lanarkshire,\" and noted that it \"differ[ed] sonically from Mend quite a bit. The songs are more layered, and we used a lot more electronics and beats on this album. There\u2019s also more emphasis on the album's coherence as a whole, and I think it plays better as a collection of songs than Mend did.\" Vocalist and guitarist Martin Henry stated that: \"the scratchy, falling-apart sound of parts of Mend frustrates me sometimes, so with Prevention I wanted to make something that was prettier and heavier at the same time. We were more interested in layers of vocals and instruments, with an emphasis on percussion, not just guitar. There are definitely a lot more keyboards on this one too. The band worked with producer Andy Miller at Chem 19 recording studios in Lanarkshire, Scotland. Guest musicians on the album include Barry Burns of Mogwai and Robert Johnston of Life Without Buildings."@en ;

Recording for the album took place during 1993 to 1994 at The Hit Factory and D&D Studios in New York City. The partly autobiographical album tells the story of B.I.G.'s experiences as a young criminal. Ready to Die is his only studio album released during his lifetime, as he was murdered just days prior to the release of his second album, Life After Death (1997). Ready to Die was released to critical acclaim and became a commercial success, achieving gold certification. In 1995, after the release, the album became a certified double platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), and the album has reached a certified quadruple platinum with sales. It was significant for revitalizing the east coast hip hop scene, amid West Coast hip hop's commercial dominance. The album's second single, \"Big Poppa\", was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Rap Solo Performance at the 1996 Grammy Awards. Ready to Die has been regarded by many music critics as one of the greatest hip-hop albums of all time. In 2003, it was ranked number 133 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time, making it the third highest hip hop album on the list after It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back and Raising Hell.

Some of the tracks are shortened versions of the live performances. The material recorded in 1980 was originally intended for release on one double LP set. But the format of the music subsequently steered them towards the release of the two double albums, this and Dead Set. Jerry Garcia commented on this in an interview: \"We really ended up with so much good material that it was a struggle. The idea of just one acoustic and one electric record was sort of pathetic, since our electric tunes are seldom less than eight minutes long. And that meant our fat electric album would have two songs on a side. It was kind of silly.\" Initial CD releases omitted one track for space reasons. One CD, tape, and LP release, by Pair/Arista Records in 1984, was given the title For the Faithful\u2026. In 1988 the album was re-issued with the original title."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Red is the fourth studio album by American singer-songwriter Taylor Swift. It was released on October 22, 2012, by Big Machine Records, as the follow-up to her third studio album, Speak Now. The album title was inspired by the \"semi-toxic relationships\" that Swift experienced during the process of conceiving this album, which Swift described the emotions she felt as \"red emotions\" due to their intense and tumultuous nature. Red touches on Swift's signature themes of love and heartbreak, however, from a more mature perspective while exploring other themes such as fame and the pressure of being in the limelight. The album features collaborations with producers and guest artists such as Gary Lightbody of Snow Patrol and Ed Sheeran and is noted for Swift's experimentation with new musical genres. Swift completed The Red Tour in support of the album on June 12, 2014, which became the highest-grossing tour of all time by a country artist, grossing over $150 million. Red was well received by critics, who reacted favorably to Swift's transition from her country roots in favor of pop sounds. At the 56th Grammy Awards, Red was nominated for Best Country Album, giving Swift her third consecutive nomination in the category, and Album of the Year, marking Swift's second nomination for Album of the Year at the Grammys, following her 2010 victory with Fearless (2008). This gave Swift the distinction of being the first country act to be nominated twice in the Album of the Year category at the Grammys in the 2010s. Red debuted at number one on the US Billboard 200 chart, giving Swift her third consecutive chart topper in the US. Its first week sales of 1.21 million was the third biggest debut in history for a female artist and became the fastest-selling album in over a decade. It made music history for claiming the biggest first week sales of all time by a country act, the record previously held by Garth Brooks. Red is just the 18th album in United States history to sell one million copies in a single week. It was also a huge global success, becoming Swift's first chart-topper in the UK, and also topped the album charts in Australia, Canada, Ireland and New Zealand while charted in the top ten in every other major market including China. Worldwide, Red has sold 6 million copies as of August 2014. It was Swift's third consecutive top-seller and the second best-seller overall across all genres despite being out only for two months. This makes the fourth time Swift has an album ranked in the year's top three sellers. Red has been certified quadruple platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), making it Swift's fourth consecutive album to reach this plateau."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Revenge is the sixth album by the British pop duo Eurythmics, released in 1986. Following on from their previous album, Be Yourself Tonight, Revenge continued further in this direction as the duo embraced a more \"rock band\" style. The album included several hit singles and was a commercial success. Its release was followed by an extensive world tour. A 1987 concert from the Australian leg of this tour was also released on home video (see Eurythmics Live). On 14 November 2005, SonyBMG repackaged and released Eurythmics' back catalog as \"2005 Deluxe Edition Reissues.\" Each of their eight studio albums' original track listings were supplemented with bonus tracks and remixes. The bonus track \"Revenge 2\" is a radically different remake of \"Revenge\", the closing track of the duo's 1981 debut album In the Garden. A line from the song (\"She said revenge can be so sweet\") is also heard at the end of \"A Little of You\"."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Revenge is the 16th studio album by American rock band Kiss, released on May 19, 1992. It was the band's first album after the death of longtime drummer Eric Carr in November 1991. Carr was replaced by Eric Singer. It was Kiss's first album since 1979's Dynasty to reach the Top 10 in the United States. The album was a worldwide success, reaching the Top 20 in seven other countries. It was certified gold by the RIAA on July 20, 1992. The album marks a return to a more Heavier sound as opposed the pop metal sound on their 5 previous records. The album was dedicated to Carr, and the last track, \"Carr Jam 1981,\" was a demo he had recorded soon after joining the group. One modification to the song was the dubbing of Bruce Kulick's guitar over Ace Frehley's, which originally appeared. The main riff of the song was used as the basis for the Frehley's Comet song \"Breakout\", from the 1987 album Frehley's Comet. \"God Gave Rock 'N' Roll to You II\" and \"Unholy\" have remained regular Kiss live staples. \"Domino\" was performed during the Revenge Tour and Kiss My Ass Tour. \"I Just Wanna\" and \"Take It Off\" were only performed during the Revenge Tour, while \"Every Time I Look at You\" and \"Spit\" were, along with \"Domino\", performed during the MTV Unplugged show."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Rewind (1971\u20131984) is a compilation album by The Rolling Stones and was released in 1984. Coming only three years after Sucking in the Seventies, the album was primarily compiled to mark the end of the band's alliance with Warner Music (in North America) and EMI (all other territories), both of whom were the distributors of Rolling Stones Records. It is the second Rolling Stones album to include a lyric sheet (after 1978's Some Girls.) For the first time since 1969's Through the Past, Darkly (Big Hits Vol. 2), the UK and US editions of Rewind (1971\u20131984) would each feature altered track listings, reflecting the individual tastes of both territories. The American CD version featured the U.S. top 20 hits from 1971-1983, with the exception of Ain't Too Proud To Beg. Released in the summer of 1984, Rewind (1971\u20131984) was not as successful as previous compilations (due, in no small part, to the track repetitions from previous retrospectives), reaching #23 in the UK and #86 in the US, though it went gold there. The album was released on Compact Disc in the United States adding \"It's Only Rock'n Roll (But I Like It)\" and \"Doo Doo Doo Doo Doo (Heartbreaker)\". This was the first official US Rolling Stones CD release. See also Video Rewind released 14 November 1984. With later compilations Jump Back: The Best of The Rolling Stones (1993) and Forty Licks (2002) superseding it, Rewind (1971\u20131984) is now out of print."@en ;

The album was produced by David Bendeth and written by band members Hayley Williams and Josh Farro, with Bendeth, and fellow members Zac Farro and Taylor York co-writing on select tracks. The album is said to explore a \"diverse range of styles,\" while not straying far from the \"signature sound\" of their debut album, with several critics comparing it to likes of Kelly Clarkson and Avril Lavigne. The cover of the album also resembles the cover artwork of No Doubt's Rock Steady. Riot! received generally positive reviews from music critics, who praised its sound, and noted its \"crossover potential\". The album was successful in the United States, reaching number fifteen on the Billboard 200 and being certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) on July 11, 2008. It was also certified platinum in the United Kingdom by the British Phonographic Industry, and gold in Australia, New Zealand, and Canada. The lead single, \"Misery Business\", reached top-thirty and forty positions in the US and is considered the band's \"breakthrough\" hit; credited with introducing the band to a mainstream audience. The third and fourth singles, \"crushcrushcrush\", and \"That's What You Get\", were also successful with both achieving a gold certification by the RIAA."@en ;

dbr:Rocket_to_Russia	rdf:type	schema:MusicAlbum ;
	dbo:abstract	"Rocket to Russia is the third studio album by the American punk rock band The Ramones, and was released on November 4, 1977, through Sire Records. Its origins date back to the summer of 1977, when \"Sheena Is a Punk Rocker\" was released as a single. That summer was known as the peak of the punk rock genre, since many punk bands were offered recording contracts. The album's recording began in August 1977, and the band had a considerably larger budget with Sire allowing them $25,000 and $30,000; much of this money went toward the album's production rather than recording. The album's cover art was directed by John Gillespie. John Holmstrom and guitarist Johnny Ramone both worked on illustration, with the entire back cover contemplating a military theme, while the inner sleeve artwork depicted many of the themes portrayed in songs. The subject matter of songs varied throughout the album, though nearly all the tracks on the album incorporated humor into the lyrics. The musical style showed more of a surf rock influence, and many songs had minimal structuring. The album received positive reception, with many critics appreciating the matured production and sound quality as compared to Rocket to Russia's predecessors. Music critic Stephen Thomas Erlewine called it his favorite Ramones album as it contained several hooks and featured more variety of tempos. The album was not as commercially successful as the band had hoped, peaking at number 49 on the Billboard 200. Band members blamed the Sex Pistols' for their lack of sales, saying that they changed the punk image for the worse. The shortage of popularity caused Tommy Ramone to leave his position as drummer, and he instead solely worked on production. The album was ranked at number 106 in Rolling Stone's \"500 Greatest Albums of All Time\" in 2012."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Scatman's World is an album by American musician Scatman John, recorded after the worldwide success of his debut single \"Scatman\". It is somewhat of a concept album dealing with an imaginary Utopian society named \"Scatland\". He speaks about this at length in the liner notes: \"If you're wondering where Scatland is, you don't have to look too far; it's between your deepest dreams and warmest wishes\". The songs deal with various elements of American society and many of them draw on Scatman's personal experience; \"Popstar\" is a tongue-in-cheek number about the shallow nature of stardom, \"Quiet Desperation\" deals with the homeless problem and \"Time (Take Your Time)\" is a harrowing song about his time in Alcoholics Anonymous. The album climaxes with \"Song of Scatland\", a ballad dedicated to the imaginary kingdom that was notoriously released as a single. \"Hi, Louis\" closes the album proper with traditional scatting over jazz piano and steady beats; the title is a reference to Louis Armstrong, to whom he later paid tribute on the track \"Everybody Jam!\". Scatman's World was very popular internationally, particularly in Japan, where it reached No. 2 and stayed on the charts for 40 weeks, selling more than 1,560,000 copies overall, and ranking as the 9th best selling album that was recorded by a non-Japanese artist of all time in that country."@en ;

This makes Second Sighting the only Frehley solo album or project (excluding compilations) to not feature Fig. \"Dancin' With Danger\" is a cover version of a song recorded by the Canadian band Streetheart which featured future Loverboy members Paul Dean and Matt Frenette. Although the songwriting credits list Frehley and Dana Strum, the music and lyrics are very similar to the original version. Sequencer programming was done by Angel keyboardist and writer Gordon G.G. Gebert. \"Insane\" and \"It's Over Now\" were released as singles with corresponding music videos. Both singles failed to chart.

Shenanigans peaked at number 27 on the Billboard 200 chart upon its release and has sold 280,000 units as of September 2010. Even though the original cover does not feature a title, several retailers fixed confusion over it by designing a sticker which was plastered on the front. In a September 2009 interview by Fuse on Demand, when asked who designed the cover for the group's eighth studio album 21st Century Breakdown (2009), Billie Joe Armstrong said that Chris Bilheimer designed it as well as the last four album covers. In 2002, Green Day embarked on the Pop Disaster Tour in support of the album; however, no songs from the album were played during any of the performances. This album was supposed to contain a #10 track called \"D.U.I (Driving Under the Influence)\". \"D.U.I\" was written by Tr\u00E9 Cool. However, it was removed in later releases of the album. \"D.U.I.\" can be seen in the booklet for the album, but has been sprayed out with black spray paint making it impossible to look at any information about the song.

This is in contrast with the band's later work, which is characterized by a cleaner, more traditional, \"American rock\" sound. CCM Magazine commented that the release was \"quite unlike anything else in Christian music\" at the time. The record was produced by Jyro Xhan and Jerome Fontamillas, at the time members of the group Mortal, under the collective pseudonym \"Blood\". The album was reissued in 2005 as an extended edition which also included the band's follow-up EP She's the Queen. This edition is digitally remastered and is packaged with slightly different artwork from that of the original release, replacing a solid silver cover with an illustration of a silver crown. (The original cassette version had a fighter plane illustration on its cover, believed to be in reference to the band's name.) The album's original liner notes, which consisted of lyrics and cryptic illustrations, were omitted in the reissue. The last line of the original booklet reads,"@en ;

Solid State Survivor is only one of a handful of YMO albums in which the track titles do not have a Japanese equivalent. The album was an early example of synthpop, a genre that the band helped pioneer alongside their earlier album Yellow Magic Orchestra (1978), and it also contributed to the development of techno.

When asked about \"Mouthful of Cavities\" the band's guitarist, Rogers Stevens, was quoted as saying, \"It's probably about the convoluted nooks and crannies of Shannon's brain.\" It featured haunting harmonies between Shannon Hoon and female vocalist Jena Kraus. Alternatively, \"New Life\" is about the birth of Hoon's daughter Nico Blue, \"Wilt\" is about having bad breath, although in Captain Beefheart-esque lyrics, \"Galaxie\" is about Hoon's experience with his car, a 1964 Ford Galaxie, and \"Lemonade\" is a tongue-in-cheek song about a bar brawl."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Straight Outta Lynwood is the twelfth studio album by \"Weird Al\" Yankovic, released on September 26, 2006. It was the sixth studio album self-produced by Yankovic. The musical styles on the album are built around parodies and pastiches of pop and rock music of the mid-2000s. The album's lead single, \"White & Nerdy\" is a parody of Chamillionaire's hit single \"Ridin'\". The single was successful, peaking at number nine on the Billboard Hot 100; \"Canadian Idiot\" also charted, peaking at number 82. The album featured five parodies. Aside from the aforementioned \"White & Nerdy\" and \"Canadian Idiot\", the album also contains lampoons of \"Confessions Part II\" by Usher, \"Do I Make You Proud\" by Taylor Hicks, and \"Trapped in the Closet\" by R. Kelly. The other half of the album is original material, featuring many \"style parodies,\" or musical imitations of existing artists. These style parodies include imitations of specific artists like Brian Wilson, Rage Against the Machine, Sparks, animated musical specials, Cake, and 1980s charity songs. Originally, there were plans for the album's lead single to have been a spoof of James Blunt's hit \"You're Beautiful\" entitled \"You're Pitiful\", but Blunt's record label, Atlantic, blocked the commercial release of the parody. The CD release was unique in that it was a DualDisc; this means that one side of the disc played the album, and the other side functioned as a DVD, featuring animated music videos for many of the songs on the record. Straight Outta Lynwood was met with mostly positive reviews, with many critics praising \"White & Nerdy\" and \"Trapped in the Drive-Thru\". Some of the original songs, however, were met with a more mixed reception. The album peaked at number 10 on the Billboard 200. \"White & Nerdy\" became Yankovic's highest-charting single, as well as his first Platinum-certified single. The record itself was certified Gold for shipments of over 500,000 copies."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Structures Of Death is the eighth studio album by the German death metal band Fleshcrawl, which was released 21 September 2007 in Germany, Austria, Italy, and the Czech Republic, then released in the rest of Europe on 24 September 2007. It is their only album to feature bassist Nico Scheffler and was their first album not recorded in Sweden. Keeping consistent with their recent work (since As Blood Rains from the Sky...), the band's unique sound is created through an amalgamation of melodic guitar rhythmics built upon a foundation of very heavy, very familiar, highly brutal drumwork and vocals. Like other melodic death metal bands, such as Grave, Arch Enemy and (early) Entombed, Fleshcrawl's guitar work for this album is laden with Swedish death metal-style distortion, especially in the riffing, which remains comparable to their earlier releases in that it utilizes mid-to-high range tones and moderate-to-rapid tempos, accented by occasional, moderately-technical guitar solos, which tend to be somewhat longer and more rhythmic than those in their earlier work. Diverging from other contemporary melodic death metal releases, the overall intensity of the album is well enhanced by the use of brutal/technical death metal-style blast beats incorporated into highly prominent, yet not obtrusive, very rapid double-Bass on the order of such bands as Kataklysm and Krisiun along with somewhat guttural, abrasive vocals, somewhat reminiscent of such bands as Six Feet Under and Cannibal Corpse. Like other Fleshcrawl albums, and death metal as a whole, the lyrical themes cover such gory, death metal-esque subjects as insanity (Structures of Death; Written In Blood), evisceration (Into the Crypts of scattered Souls; Nothing But Flesh Remains), the Grim Reaper/Harvester of Souls (Anthem of Death), demons/demonic possession (Rest in Pain; A Spirit Dressed in Black), Mortality (About Mortality), and doomsday/the apocalypse (War of the Dead). However, unlike any of their earlier releases, this album includes several references to their earlier work. Track 4, Written in Blood, includes the lines, \"Forever more the soulskinner is back,\" referencing to their sixth studio album, Soulskinner, and track 6, Fleshcult, which describes the mindset of death metal and the experience of the band through their 20-year history through a collection of synecdochal allusions to their previous work, including:"@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Surfacing is the fourth studio album by Canadian singer-songwriter Sarah McLachlan. Released in 1997, it was produced by McLachlan's frequent collaborator, Pierre Marchand. McLachlan set about writing Surfacing in 1996, after two and a half years touring for her previous album, 1994's Fumbling Towards Ecstasy. Mentally exhausted, she found it difficult to concentrate on her new album and took six months off in Vancouver. After that she completed the ten songs for the album and went to Marchand's Quebec studio to record. Surfacing was released in July 1997, coinciding with the start of McLachlan's Lilith Fair tour. The album was a commercial success worldwide, reached the top position on the Canadian RPM 100 Albums chart and number two on the US Billboard 200. Critical reviews were mixed; some of the more positive reviews praised the songwriting, while the album's detractors criticized it as banal and slow. The album spawned two Billboard Hot 100 top-five hits, \"Adia\" and \"Angel\", the top-15 hit \"Building a Mystery\", and the top-30 hit \"Sweet Surrender\". A radio-only song, \"I Love You\", was released in 2000. The album won four Juno Awards including for Album of the Year. \"Building a Mystery\" was awarded the Grammy Award for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance, while the instrumental-only song \"Last Dance\" won the Grammy Award for Best Pop Instrumental Performance."@en ;

The special was a musical revue starring Motown's two most popular groups at the time, Diana Ross & the Supremes and The Temptations. Containing a combination of showtunes, specially prepared numbers, and popular Motown hits, the special was taped before a live studio audience in September 1968 and originally broadcast December 9, 1968 on NBC, sponsored by the Timex watch corporation. The title of the program uses a then-popular acronym, \"TCB\", which stands for \"Taking Care of Business\". Among the program's highlights were Diana Ross' \"Afro Vogue\" solo spot, Paul Williams' emotionally charged rendition of \"For Once in My Life,\" a cover by both groups of the Aretha Franklin version of Otis Redding's \"Respect,\" and then-new Temptations lead singer Dennis Edwards' lead performance on \"(I Know) I'm Losing You,\" a song considered a signature for his predecessor, David Ruffin. Pre-empting Laugh-In on Monday night, TCB was the first musical TV special of the rock era to air on American broadcast television. It exceeded all performance expectations, winning its timeslot in the ratings and becoming the top-rated variety show of 1968. A soundtrack album, TCB \u2013 The Original Cast Soundtrack was released a week before the special aired on December 9 and reached #1 on the U.S. Billboard Top 200 albums chart. It also became the third #1 album for Diana Ross and The Supremes. The show received an Emmy Nomination for Outstanding Individual Achievement in Electronic Production."@en ;

The album was released in mid 1984 on MCA in the United States and the United Kingdom, two years after Frey's modestly successful d\u00E9but album, No Fun Aloud and four years after the demise of the Eagles. It was and still is Frey's most successful solo album throughout his whole solo career, having reached #22 on the Billboard charts, and releasing two Top 20 singles with \"Smuggler's Blues\" and \"Sexy Girl\". The album achieved Gold status by the RIAA in the US. It is generally regarded as the culmination of the smoother, more adult-oriented sound of Frey's solo work. The single \"Smuggler's Blues\" helped to inspire the Miami Vice episode of the same name, and Frey was invited to star in that episode, which was Frey's acting d\u00E9but. The music video for the single also won Frey an MTV Video Music Award in 1985."@en ;

It was produced and mixed at Mountain Studios (Montreux) in Switzerland and according to Bowie it took only six days to write and record, but fifteen days to mix due to some \"technical breakdowns\". The album has been classified as a soundtrack although the title track was the only song to be featured in the television programme (see below). Two of the tracks are ambient instrumentals and quite similar to Bowie's work with Brian Eno in the late 1970s.
