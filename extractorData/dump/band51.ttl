	dbo:abstract	"Dr. Dog is an American rock band from West Grove, Pennsylvania, United States. Its lineup consists of Toby Leaman (bass guitar), Scott McMicken (lead guitar), Frank McElroy (rhythm guitar), Zach Miller (keyboard), and Eric Slick (drums). Lead vocal duties are shared between Leaman and McMicken, with all members contributing harmonies. In addition, each band member has a nickname beginning with the letter T, and they have explained that friends of the band also receive nicknames, which are drawn from aspects of their lives and personalities (Former member Andrew \"Trial\" Jones, for example, is a licensed attorney). The band's musical styling of indie rock is strongly influenced by bands of the 1960s, such as The Beatles and The Beach Boys, but they have also touched upon more unrelated genres since their inception. Their earlier recordings show influence of the lo-fi sound and pop sensibilities of indie rock bands of the 1990s, such as Guided by Voices and Pavement, although recent albums have featured more polished production."@en .

Founded in Baltimore, Maryland, and active since 1992, Dru Hill recorded seven Top 40 hits, and is best known for the R&B #1 hits \"In My Bed\", \"Never Make a Promise\", and \"How Deep Is Your Love\". Tamir \"Nokio\" Ruffin was the group's founder; his groupmates included lead singer Mark \"Sisq\u00F3\" Andrews, Larry \"Jazz\" Anthony, and James \"Woody Rock\" Green. Signing to Island Records through Haqq Islam's University Records imprint, the group released two successful albums, Dru Hill and Enter the Dru, before separating for a period from late 1999 to 2002, during which time Sisq\u00F3 and Woody released solo albums. While Woody's Soul Music LP was a moderate success in the gospel music industry, Sisq\u00F3's debut album, Unleash the Dragon, and its hit single, \"Thong Song\", were major pop successes, and established Sisq\u00F3 as a household name outside of Dru Hill. Sisq\u00F3's second album, Return of Dragon, did not sell as well. In 2002, by then part of the Def Soul record label, the group reunited and added fifth member Rufus \"Scola\" Waller to the lineup for their third album, Dru World Order, whose underperformance led to the group being dropped from Def Soul. In 2009, the group signed to Kedar Entertainment Group and released their fourth album, InDRUpendence Day, the following year, with new member Tao taking the place of the again departed Woody."@en ;

After Brainiac, Schmersal made a solo album under the name John Stuart Mill. Rick Lee and Steve Calhoon were both previous members of the band Skeleton Key, a befriended band Brainiac had toured with. Together they formed Enon. Lee created a number of percussion sounds for the band playing a \"junk kit\" including a Radio Flyer wagon, propane tank, and old hubcaps. After the release of their first album Believo! which was Produced by D. Sardy and signed to his SeeThru Broadcasting label in 1999, Calhoon left the band and was replaced by Toko Yasuda (bass/vocals/keyboard) and Matt Schulz (drums). Yasuda was previously in the bands Blonde Redhead, The Lapse and The Van Pelt. With the new lineup, Enon released High Society also produced by Sardy in 2002 and toured with The Faint. A majority of Enon's albums have been released on the Chicago-based indie label, Touch and Go Records after the closing of SeeThru Broadcasting. Lee left the band, and Enon went on to release Hocus Pocus in 2003, and a collection of singles and previously difficult to find internet-released songs with a bonus DVD entitled Lost Marbles & Exploded Evidence in February 2005. In 2007, all three members of Enon contributed to Les Savy Fav's album Let's Stay Friends. Yasuda also did vocal contributions to previous recordings of this band, e.g. the first track of The Cat and the Cobra. Enon released their fourth and final studio album, Grass Geysers...Carbon Clouds on Touch and Go Records on October 9, 2007. In summer 2008, drummer Matt Schulz announced that he would be leaving the group to pursue other interests. Afterwards he joined Holy Fuck as a touring member. Brainiac's former bassist, Monasterio, directs music videos, including two for Enon, and released an album in 2008 with a new band called Model/Actress; Schmersal makes appearances on this album."@en ;

The group was founded in 1999 and became a prominent figure of the underground hip hop scene, known for Larsen's philosophical and socially conscious lyrics, along with Keltgen's dynamic experimental fusion of stylistic elements from both rap and rock, as well as electronic music. The group was active until Larsen's death in October 2010. Over the course of just over a decade, the duo collaborated with many well-known hip hop groups and artists such as Aesop Rock and Sage Francis, playing a preeminent role in the emerging underground rap movement. Larsen's highly successful background work in freestyle rap and rap battles, along with his greatly introspective, complex and poetic sense of lyrical integrity heavily influenced E&A's distinctive musical output and largely defined the group as a unique and stylistically independent presence within alternative hip hop."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Frankenstein Drag Queens from Planet 13 are a horror punk band from North Carolina. The band was formed in 1996 by Wednesday 13, who recruited friends and former Maniac Spider Trash bandmates Seaweed and Sicko Zero. The band's history is riddled with a 'revolving door' lineup with 13 the only member to have never been replaced. After breaking up in 2001 when Wednesday 13 left to perform vocals with the Murderdolls, the band reformed for a brief reunion in 2005, releasing a box set containing their entire library of recordings except for the track \"Look Mom I Killed A Chicken\" because Wednesday 13's master copy was \"destroyed beyond repair\". This track is exclusively available on the 197666 7-inch LP and the band-released \"Chop off My Hand\" CD-R. The music of the Frankenstein Drag Queens was played in a punk rock style. Lyrically the band were inspired by horror B-movies and references in popular culture. As well as a large leaning towards punk the band's live show and appearance took cues from glam rock acts such as Alice Cooper, New York Dolls and KISS. They were known to wear dresses and make-up on stage as part of their performance."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"From First to Last is an American rock band based in Arizona, originally from the Los Angeles Area, Illinois and Tampa, Florida. The current line-up consists of bassist Matt Manning, guitarists Matt Good, Travis Richter and Taylor Larson and drummer Derek Bloom. The band released their first EP titled Aesthetic in 2003 which they recorded with founding member and vocalist Phillip Reardon who left the band in 2004 due to personal and creative differences. Dear Diary, My Teen Angst Has a Body Count followed in 2004 and Heroine in 2006, both with former vocalist Sonny Moore. Following the departure of Moore in February 2007 to work on his solo electronic project, Skrillex, the band added permanent bassist Matt Manning, and Matt Good moved to lead vocals/guitar. They released a self-titled album in 2008 on Suretone Records. On August 27, 2009, From First to Last confirmed on DJ Rossstar's Punk Rock Show that they have indeed left Suretone and are now signed to Rise Records. In late 2009, they parted ways with longtime guitarist/vocalist Travis Richter. Their fourth studio album, Throne to the Wolves was released on March 16, 2010. On July 28, 2010, the band entered a hiatus. In November 2013, From First to Last reformed after 3 years of hiatus and launched a Kickstarter campaign to fund the recording of a new EP with the return of guitarist/vocalist Travis Richter who had left the band in 2009. In April 2014 Richter and Good made a video announcement and re-recorded track teaser \"The Latest Plague\" from Heroine (2006) via Alternative Press with Periphery vocalist Spencer Sotelo confirming that Spencer was the new lead vocalist to feature on the band's upcoming second EP. In the latter part of May 2014 the new line up released a remake of the song \"Note to Self\" from Dear Diary, My Teen Angst Has a Body Count to commemorate the 10-year anniversary of the album. On January 13, 2015 the band released their eponymous lead single, \"Dead Trees\", from their recently released fifth album. The album was released on April 27, 2015 under the record label Sumerian Records as a LP and not an EP."@en ;

Goldfrapp's second album Black Cherry, which incorporated glam rock and synthpop sounds into their music, was released in 2003. The album influenced the same dance-oriented sound of their third album Supernature. Supernature took Goldfrapp's work further into dance music, and enjoyed international chart success. The album produced three number-one US dance singles, and was nominated for Best Electronic/Dance Album at the 49th Grammy Awards. Their fourth album Seventh Tree placed a greater emphasis on ambient and downtempo music, drawing inspiration from nature and paganism, while their fifth album, Head First, found the group exploring 1980s-influenced synthpop. Head First also earned the duo their second Grammy Award nomination for Best Electronic/Dance Album in 2010. Goldfrapp released their critically acclaimed sixth studio album, the folktronica-influenced Tales of Us, in September 2013."@en ;

The band's name comes from The Gore Gore Girls, a 1972 B-movie by Herschell Gordon Lewis, which is a parody of the term Go Go Girls. Like fellow Detroit bands The White Stripes and The Detroit Cobras, the band started out struggling through the local club circuit before being \"discovered\" by independent record label Get Hip Records in 1998. Their first single \"Mama in the Movies\" (1999) gained favourable airplay on college radio stations in Michigan, which led to recording their first full-length album Strange Girls in (2000). The second album Up All Night, was released in 2002 and received positive press from the Village Voice and Detroit Free Press. During this time the band toured Europe twice, in 2002 and in 2003, also with infrequent dates in the United States. The band became a four-piece in 2004 with the addition of The Hammer (Marlene Hammerle) on guitar and began touring the United States extensively. Gore Gore Girls toured as direct support for The Cramps in 2003 and 2004. The band released an EP in 2004, 7 X 4, which became part of their third album, Get the Gore. Tracks from the EP and subsequent third album received airplay on Little Steven's Underground Garage Program on Sirius Satellite Radio; the band was featured at Little Steven's Underground Garage Festival on Randall's Island, New York along with other 'garage rock' luminaries and legends The Stooges, The Strokes, The New York Dolls, The Zombies and others. Get the Gore, released in 2007 on Bloodshot Records, was recorded at Ghetto Recorders in Detroit, Michigan and received positive press from USA Today and Playboy Magazine. Gore Gore Girls toured Europe again in spring of 2008, the band's third tour of Scandinavia and Western European countries."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Indian Ocean is an Indian rock band formed in New Delhi in 1990, who are widely recognized as the pioneers of the fusion rock genre in India. Susmit Sen, Asheem Chakravarty, Rahul Ram and Amit Kilam were band members till Chakravarty's death on 25 December 2009, after which Tuheen Chakravorty and Himanshu Joshi were officially inducted into the band as replacements. After the departure of Susmit Sen in 2013, Rahul Ram is the only founding member who appeared on the band's debut album Indian Ocean. The musical style of the band can be at best classified as jazz fusion and fusion music. It is an experimental genre, fusing raga (traditional Indian tunes) with rock music, guitars and drums, sometimes using Indian folk songs. It has also been described by some music critics as \"Indo-rock fusion with jazz-spiced rhythms that integrates shlokas, sufism, environmentalism, mythology and revolution\". Since 2010, the band has moved against the lines of record labels. They released their latest album 16/330 Khajoor Road online for free. The main reason for this move was the frustration over negotiating contracts with record companies and fighting over copyright issues. They have turned to concerts and sponsorships for generating revenue rather than playing in the hands of record labels. For a brief amount of time they had the sponsorship of Johnnie Walker. They are also a part of the world's first Music Personalisation Initiative named DRP as one of the five Featured Artists. In its 2014 listing of \"25 Greatest Indian Rock Songs of the last 25 Years\", \"Rolling Stone India\" featured two songs, Ma Rewa and Kandisa from the album, Kandisa (2000)."@en ;

The group was formed in 1967 by a group of university students and it acquired widespread popularity in Chile for their song Venceremos (We shall win!) which became the anthem of the Popular Unity government of Salvador Allende. At the moment of the September 11, 1973 Chilean coup they were on tour in Europe and were unable to return to their country where their music was proscribed by the ruling military junta. In Europe their music took on a multifarious character, incorporating elements of European baroque and other traditional music forms to their rich and colourful Latin American rhythms - creating a distinctive fusion of modern world music. They are perhaps the best internationally known members of the nueva canci\u00F3n movement. Their name means 'Sun of the Illimani.' In Aymara Illimani is the name of a mountain in the Bolivian Andes.

Following a period of several years working behind the scenes in music production, multi-instrumentalist and producer/engineer Piet Sielck joined with former Helloween bandmate Kai Hansen and then-drummer for Blind Guardian Thomen Stauch in a new project that would blend power metal with a high-concept science fiction story. The band's debut album Iron Savior introduced the story that would be told over the course of multiple albums, featuring a self-aware space vessel called the Iron Savior and its relationship to the mythical lost civilization of Atlantis. Critics have compared Iron Savior's sound and musical approach to classic heavy metal bands like Judas Priest, Iron Maiden, and Queensr\u00FFche. Kai Hansen's presence in the band brought to the Iron Savior albums on which he appeared a style heavily influenced by Gamma Ray and Helloween. Since its inception, Iron Savior has released nine studio albums, two EPs, two singles and one live album. Despite numerous lineup changes, Piet has continued to direct the band and is currently the only remaining founding member."@en ;

The band has had 16 different members in 20 years and put out 25 albums under the leadership of keyboardist/composer Brian Haas. The current lineup is Haas on piano, Fender Rhodes and synthesizers, Josh Raymer (joined 2007) on drums and Chris Combs (joined 2008) on electric guitar, lap steel, and synthesizer. JFJO's music is not easily categorized; although it is mostly in the jazz idiom, it draws from hip hop, funk and rock music. Critic Alex Henderson describes the band's music as a \"mildly avant-garde blend of jazz, rock and funk [that] draws on a wide variety of influences... Often quirky, eccentric and abstract, JFJO favors an inside/outside approach but is usually more inside than outside.\", while critic Scott Yanow describes the group as \"fascinating\". Their live shows include compositions by John Coltrane, Duke Ellington, Charles Mingus, and Thelonious Monk among others, and include long experimental improvisations that, at times, could be considered atonal. Furthermore, the band's early years as an octet featured a strong hip-hop influence. The group began with different monikers and members in the early 90s including founding members Haas and Reed Mathis, as well as Sean Layton, Dove McHargue, Matt Leland, & Kyle Wright. In 1994, after repeated viewings of This Is Spinal Tap and increased attendance at their shows, the band members agreed on \"Jacob Fred Jazz Odyssey\" as the band's new name. \"Jazz Odyssey\" coming from a scene in the aforementioned Spinal Tap comedy film and \"Jacob Fred\" being what Haas wanted his unborn brother to be named at age 3."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Kayo Dot is an American avant-garde group formed in 2003 by Toby Driver after the break-up of maudlin of the Well, releasing their debut album Choirs of the Eye on John Zorn's Tzadik Records that same year. Since then, Kayo Dot's lineup has drastically changed over the years. Toby Driver is the only founding member of the band still remaining, save for frequent lyrical contributions from former motW member Jason Byron, culminating in a guest track on the Hubardo album. Up until 2011, the lineup was constantly shifting, and Kayo Dot's sound consistently changed over the years, featuring a wide variety of instrumentation featuring guitar, drums, bass, violin, saxophone, vibraphone, synthesizers, clarinets and flutes. Underground metal audiences warmly received the group upon its early existence, with the 2003 album Choirs of the Eye and the 2006 album Dowsing Anemone with Copper Tongue both becoming underground hits in the progressive metal scene. Over the years, in addition to the rotating lineup and constantly changing sounds, Kayo Dot has been signed to a number of different record labels, Tzadik, Robotic Empire, Hydra Head before taking to Kickstarter and pre-orders to crowdfund their albums, as to be free of record label interference. The group signed to The Flenser in 2014. As of 2016, Kayo Dot has released eight studio albums, one EP and one split: Choirs of the Eye in 2003, Dowsing Anemone with Copper Tongue as well as Kayo Dot/Bloody Panda Split in 2006, Blue Lambency Downward, Coyote in 2010, an EP titled Stained Glass in 2011, Gamma Knife in 2012 and a double-album Hubardo in 2013. Coffins on Io, the group's seventh album, was released on October 16, 2014 via The Flenser. Their eighth studio album, Plastic House on Base of Sky, was released on June 24, 2016."@en ;

In 1986, King Diamond released their debut album Fatal Portrait. Since then the band have released a total of twelve studio albums (most of them concept albums), two live albums, two extended plays, five compilations and five singles. Since the band's inception, there have been over fifteen musicians in and out of King Diamond, with the only two mainstays being vocalist King Diamond and guitarist Andy LaRocque. In 1987 the band released their second studio release Abigail (their first concept album). Throughout the 1980s, King Diamond released a total of four studio albums. In the early 1990s, the band was put on hold when King Diamond reunited with his former outfit Mercyful Fate. After reforming King Diamond in 1994, Diamond would balance recording and touring with both Mercyful Fate and his eponymous band throughout the 90's. Since the early 2000s, King Diamond have kept recording and touring and, since 2014, the band has been composed of vocalist King Diamond, guitarist Andy LaRocque, guitarist Mike Wead, drummer Matt Thompson, and bassist Pontus Egberg."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Leb i sol (Macedonian: \u041B\u0435\u0431 \u0438 \u0441\u043E\u043B) is a Macedonian rock group founded in the 1970s by Vlatko Stefanovski (guitar), Bodan Arsovski (bass guitar), Nikola Kokan Dimu\u0161evski (keyboards) and Garabet Tavitjan (drums). Tavitjan ceded the drumwork to Dragoljub \u0110uri\u010Di\u0107 for some of the albums, while Kiril D\u017Eajkovski replaced Kokan on Kao Kakao and Putujemo. Beside being the most eminent Macedonian band, they were also one of the most important acts of the former Yugoslav Rock scene. \"Leb i sol\" is a traditional greeting which literally translates to \"bread and salt\". It is often used as an expression of spite or determination; e.g. \"I will eat bread and salt if I have to, but I will not give in!\", but that has nothing to do with the band's name. More commonly, distinguished visitors to villages and communities would be offered a piece of home-baked bread and a dip of salt as a traditional welcome, which is where the name of the band really came from. Their music combined elements of rock, jazz fusion and ethnic Macedonian music. As the band matured, the jazz influences became less obvious. However, in concert, Leb i sol performances of jazzed-up and lengthy versions of traditional ethno-folk classics such as \"Jovano Jovanke\" or \"Aber Dojde Donke\", were often received with great enthusiasm and cheer. Leb i sol were very popular in the 1970s and 1980s and, while not selling as many records as some pop and folk acts, were very well known and respected and often sold-out venues in most of the larger cities in the former Yugoslavia. The first two albums are often considered foundational, while most are diverse enough to be, at least in part, accessible to a fairly wide audience. The influence of ethnic music and folk music of Republic of Macedonia are recognizable in the use of odd meters (5/4, 7/8) and non-traditional scales (e.g. the Phrygian dominant scale). While all the musicians were fairly accomplished, Vlatko Stefanovski is frequently regarded as an exceptional guitar virtuoso."@en ;

The group has recorded seven albums, one EP, and a greatest hits package for the defunct BNA Records, and one album each for three different independent labels.

Although only achieving minor cult success, the band is notable for being one of the ground breaking groups in darkwave and ethereal wave styles. Their 1995 album The Burning Circle and Then Dust received some attention for the power pop hit song \"Pray,\" and the album \"remains a high point of American dark rock,\" according to Allmusic. Lycia's music is characterized by rich soundscapes and layers of echoed guitars, dark and ethereal keyboards, doomy drum machine beats, VanPortfleet's melancholic, whispered vocals and Vanflower's vivid voice. Trent Reznor and Peter Steele are some of their more well-known fans."@en ;

Since 1997, however, the band's musical direction has shifted towards a more melodic and lyric-driven ska/indie rock sound, a combination that's been described as \"Weezer meets The Specials\". Dan Potthast (guitar/vocals), Ted Moll (drums), Chris Diebold (bass) and Robert Bell (trombone) have remained with MU330 since the band's inception, while trombonist Gerry Lundquist has been a member for over a decade.

	dbo:abstract	"Madredeus (Portuguese pronunciation: [ma\u00F0\u027E\u0268\u02C8\u00F0ew\u0283]) is a Portuguese musical ensemble. Their music combines traditional Portuguese music (which is sometimes erroneously associated with the subgenre of Fado) with influences of modern folk music. The lyrics are often melancholy, related to the sea or travelling or absence, continuing a tradition of songs dating back to Medieval times (with obvious connection to cantigas de amigo among others). Madredeus founding members were Pedro Ayres Magalh\u00E3es (classical guitar), Rodrigo Le\u00E3o (keyboard synthesizer), Francisco Ribeiro (cello), Gabriel Gomes (accordion) and Teresa Salgueiro (vocals). Magalh\u00E3es and Le\u00E3o formed the band in 1985, Ribeiro and Gomes joined in 1986. In search of a female singer, they found Teresa Salgueiro in one of Lisbon's night clubs. Teresa agreed to join and, in 1987, Madredeus recorded their first album, Os dias da Madredeus. The first album was recorded in their rehearsal space, a converted abbey in Lisbon. The recording was especially strenuous due to deafening interruptions every 5 minutes from Lisbon's tram service, which ran directly above. In honour of this unavoidable presence in their every performance, they named themselves after the surrounding neighborhood, Madre de Deus (Mother of God), shortened to the vernacular Madredeus. In 1993, Pedro Ayres Magalh\u00E3es left the band temporarily and was replaced in live concerts by Jos\u00E9 Peixoto (classical guitar). Magalh\u00E3es rejoined the group later, making it a sextet with two guitarists. They released several albums and became very popular in Portugal, but remained relatively unknown abroad. This changed in 1994 when Wim Wenders, impressed by their music, asked Madredeus to perform in his movie Lisbon Story - the soundtrack gave the band international fame. Madredeus consequently toured Europe, South America, Africa and Asia. In 1994, Rodrigo Le\u00E3o left the band to start a solo career, being replaced by Carlos Maria Trindade (keyboard synthesizer). In 1997, Francisco Ribeiro and Gabriel Gomes left the band as Madredeus' style started abandoning its fado roots with the release of O Para\u00EDso. At this time Fernando J\u00FAdice (Acoustic bass guitar) was invited to join them. The group would, again, be a quintet.Madredeus has sold over 3 million albums worldwide. In 1998, Madredeus contributed \"Os Dias S\u00E3o A Noite (Suso Saiz Remix)\" to the AIDS benefit compilation album Onda Sonora: Red Hot + Lisbon produced by the Red Hot Organization. In November 2007, Teresa Salgueiro announced she had left Madredeus and she has released six solo albums until now. Former member and co-founder Francisco Ribeiro released his first solo album Desiderata: A Jun\u00E7\u00E3o do Bem in 2009. He died on 14 September 2010 from cancer. In April 2012 Madredeus announced its new album Essencia. This album is a travel through Madredeus music for 25 years since it was formed. Madredeus announced too its new formation, composed of Beatriz Nunes (singer), Pedro Ayres de Magalh\u00E3es (guitar), Carlos Maria Trinidade (synthesizer), Jorge Varrecoso (violin), Antonio Figueirido (violin) and Luis Clode (cello). With this new formation Pedro Ayres said in an interview: \"The melody is much more supported, without losing harmonic and rhythmic sense and keeps walking Madredeus\"."@en ;

After modest success in the United States in the mid-1990s with the singles \"Slowly, Slowly\" and \"Open the Door\" and a series of albums produced by Michael Stipe, Bob Mould, and Geza X, the band went on an extended hiatus due to the dissolution of their record label. They returned with a new rhythm section in 2005 on the Daemon Records release Mouthfeel. The band has continued to perform and record since this reunion and have self-released two more albums.

Man\u00E1 has earned four Grammy Awards, eight Latin Grammy Awards, five MTV Video Music Awards Latin America, six Premios Juventud awards, nineteen Billboard Latin Music Awards and fifteen Premios Lo Nuestro awards. It is considered by many as the most influential and successful Latin American band of all time with over 40 million albums sold worldwide. Man\u00E1 has topped the all-time lists in much of Latin America and in their native Mexico, where they set landmarks in record sales and concert attendances. The band formed in 1986 and released its first album, Falta Amor, in 1990. In 1992, the group released \u00BFD\u00F3nde Jugar\u00E1n Los Ni\u00F1os?, which sold more than 10 million copies worldwide, (over 700,000 copies in the US alone) becoming the best selling Spanish-language rock album of all time.

Man\u00E1 followed with Sue\u00F1os L\u00EDquidos (1997), Revoluci\u00F3n de Amor (2002), and Amar es Combatir (2006), which continued the group's success. The band followed up with Drama y Luz in April 2011. Their most recent album is Cama Incendiada, which was released in early 2015.

Its most popular line-up (which lasted from 1977-1999) was Martin Plaza (birth name Martin Murphy) on vocals and guitar; Reg Mombassa (birth name Chris O'Doherty) on lead guitar and vocals; his brother Peter \"Yoga Dog\" O'Doherty on bass guitar and vocals; Wayne de Lisle (birth name David Twohill) on drums; and Andrew \"Greedy\" Smith on vocals, keyboards and harmonica. Their original hit songs were generated by Mombassa, O'Doherty, Plaza and Smith, either individually or collectively; they also hit the Australian charts with covers of songs by Roy Orbison, Elvis Presley and Chuck Berry. Their top ten Australian singles are \"If You Leave Me, Can I Come Too?\" and \"Too Many Times\" (both from 1981), \"Live It Up\" (1985) and \"Rock and Roll Music\" (1988). Internationally, \"Too Many Times\" made the Canadian top 40 in 1982, and \"Live It Up\" peaked at No. 3 in UK, No. 4 in Norway, and No. 6 in Germany, after it featured in the 1986 Australian film \"Crocodile\" Dundee. All of the early members are visual artists and have had combined studio displays, some have had solo studio displays with Mombassa's artwork also used as designs by the Mambo clothing company. The majority of the group's record covers, posters and video clips have been designed and created by themselves or their art school contemporaries. On 27 August 2009, Mental As Anything was inducted into the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) Hall of Fame alongside Kev Carmody, The Dingoes, Little Pattie and John Paul Young."@en ;

The band has attributed its success in Asia to their clean-living image and to singing in English as a second language. MLTR has earned Gold and Platinum status for records in many countries and won many awards, including the Gold Preis Award from RSH, Germany and \"The Best Performing Act of the Year\" at the SEA Grammy Awards in Singapore. In addition, their song \"Take Me To Your Heart\" was awarded \"most downloaded single of the year 2006\" had 6 million or more paid downloads. The band has recorded eight studio albums as well as a number of live and greatest hits albums. During the peak of their popularity in the mid-1990s, MLTR was described by critics as being \"as good (if not better) a band as any current big name group out of America or the UK.\" According to the band's record label releases, their sound is \"the perfect balance of a Scandinavian glow and the international pop song that has been instrumental in forming the compelling sound of the band\", although the lead singer and songwriter, Jascha Richter, disagrees with this, maintaining that the music defies geographical categorization."@en ;

Mokoma started out as a creation of Marko Annala, who is the band's lead singer, and has been the band's only original bandmember. The name comes from Annala's former girlfriends' Karelian grandmother, who said \"Voi siuta mokomaa\". That means \"Oh gosh, you and your tricks\", basically in simple words when put into English. Mokoma is similar but slightly more gracious word to \"damned\" or \"accursed\". Through the years several members have come and gone, but only Marko has remained constant. The band started out as a more traditional rock band with their first two albums \"Valu\" and \"Mokoman 120 p\u00E4iv\u00E4\u00E4\". However, both albums sold badly and they were eventually dropped when they suggested to their record company (EMI), that they wanted to play something more closer to their hearts, thrash metal. The group moved on and created their own record company, called Sakara Records, and released their third album \"Kurimus\", which is sometimes regarded as the first thrash metal album sung in Finnish. That was the first release of the members' independent record company Sakara Records. Since then they have released seven more albums and an EP called \"Viides vuodenaika\", which reached position one in the Finnish albums chart. Their latest album release is \"El\u00E4vien kirjoihin\"."@en ;

In fall 2004, Torsten Pr\u00F6frock became a member of Monolake. Monolake's minimal, dub-influenced techno music helped establish the sound of the Chain Reaction label, also located in Berlin, subsequently using their own [ml/i] (Monolake / Imbalance Computer Music) label for the group's output. Both current members have solo projects, with Henke releasing under his own name and Pr\u00F6frock as \"T++\" and \"Various Artists.\" In 2008 T++ followed Ricardo Villalobos in bridging the gap between minimal techno and dubstep, by remixing Shackleton's Death Is Not Final for the Skull Disco label. In 2009, Robert Henke appeared in the electronic music documentary Speaking In Code which presented the completion of the Monodeck. As of 2012, Henke has been designing a new form of live show syncing surround-sound audio stems with visual loops, allowing for improvisation.

	dbo:abstract	"Motograter is an American nu metal band formed in 1995. They are best known for their homemade instrument, the \"Motograter\", designed with industrial cable and guitar pieces that creates a unique bass sound and painting themselves in a tribal style body paint for live concerts. Under the band's original line-up, they released two EPs, Hugh Chardon and Indy. Original singer Zak Ward switched to keyboards and samples in 2002 (while sometimes still providing additional vocals both live and in studio) and was replaced by Ivan \"Ghost\" Moody which led to the release of their first studio album Motograter in 2003. The band went on an indefinite hiatus in 2005, disbanded after playing a one-time reunion show in 2006, and then reformed with a new line-up in 2008, featuring singer Michael \"Angel\" Woodruff. They released the EP Pre-Release in 2009, and toured until the band's second split up in 2011. The band reunited again in late 2013, performing at Slipknot's Knotfest the next year. In December 2014, Woodruff left Motograter, replacing him with James Anthony Legion in early 2015. Motograter began recording of their sophomore album Desolation in January 2016 with Ahrue Luster (Ill Nino, Machine Head, Terror Universal) overseeing production, expected to be released later this year."@en ;

The group first found success in Europe after the release of their debut album, The Tennessee Fire (1999). Their next release, At Dawn (2001), led to a large stateside following and preceded several lineup changes. After signing to major label ATO Records, the group released two albums, It Still Moves (2003) and Z (2005), with the latter representing a critical breakthrough. Their next release, Evil Urges (2008), was more polarizing for fans and critics, while Circuital (2011), their sixth album, saw a more measured response. After many years of side projects and touring, the band's seventh album, The Waterfall, was released in 2015."@en ;

The band's lyrical themes mostly revolve around sex, drugs, drinking, fighting, and rock 'n' roll. Initially called Hell's Half-Acre, the band's name comes from Ted Nugent's introduction to \"Wang Dang Sweet Poontang\" on the Double Live Gonzo album. Following the initial 1997 breakup of Kentucky cowpunk band Nine Pound Hammer, guitarist Blaine Cartwright formed Nashville Pussy where he would take up vocal duties in addition to guitar. The core lineup of Nashville Pussy consists of husband-and-wife duo Blaine Cartwright and Ruyter Suys (pronounced \"Rider Sighs\"), and drummer Jeremy Thompson. Original drummer Adam Neal (Nine Pound Hammer) left to form The Hookers. Original bassist Corey Parks (sister of former NBA basketball player Cherokee Parks) quit one month after the release of the album High as Hell, and later joined Die Hunns. Tracy Almazan aka Tracy Kickass formerly of NYC's The Wives, and Helldorado was enlisted to replace Parks mid-tour. Nashville Pussy recorded Say Something Nasty with Almazan on bass only to be replaced by Katielyn Campbell (of the band Famous Monsters). Katie Lynn's image is on the album Say Something Nasty. Campbell was subsequently replaced by Karen Cuda for the album Get Some. Karen Cuda also appeared as bassist on the album \"From Hell To Texas\", and in the live DVD Live in Hollywood.

This gives the band a tense and highly driven sub-hardcore sound featuring distorted effects-laden guitar and energetic drums. The band was formed while at sixth form college and they recorded their first album while some of the members were still teenagers. This led to a strong teenaged fanbase with a reputation for enjoying crowd surfing and moshing at their gigs. The band was also noted (and occasionally ridiculed) for their early image, which consisted of uniformly crimped hair and a predilection for sporting shorts and band or skateboard T-shirts. \"The Neds\" (as their fans referred to them) were well known for their own distinctive T-shirts, reportedly producing over 86 different designs within three years (1987\u20131990).

	dbo:abstract	"No Fun at All (often abbreviated to just NFAA) is a Swedish punk rock band. The band formed in the summer of 1991 in Skinnskatteberg. The group initially consisted of Mikael Danielsson (guitar), Henrik Sunvisson (bass guitar) and Jimmy Olsson (vocals, drums). The name was inspired by a tongue-in-cheek version of The Stooges' song \"No Fun\" as covered by the Sex Pistols, and the name of the band Sick of It All. The group released their albums on the Swedish label Burning Heart Records outside the United States. Within the U.S., No Fun at All's albums were released by Theologian Records and later by Epitaph Records. In 1993, Jimmy Olsson left the band to concentrate on his other band Sober. No Fun at All then recruited three new members in Ingemar Jansson (vocals), Krister Johansson (guitar) and Kjell Ramstedt (drums). In 1999, Sunvisson left No Fun at All. Danielsson switched from guitar to bass guitar and Stefan Neuman, from Tribulation, took up the vacant guitar slot. On November 11, 2001, after ten years together and over 250,000 album sales worldwide, No Fun at All decided to quits. Since 2004, No Fun at All has performed some reunion gigs. At the reunion show at the Groezrock Festival, No Fun at All announced that they would bring out a new album in the fall of 2008 through their own label Beat 'Em Down Records. On April 19, 2012 the Millencolin Festival announced that No Fun At All canceled their show at the festival due to their disbandment .

The line-up for that album included Bostich, Clorofila, Fussible, Hiperboreal, Panoptica, Plankton Man and Terrestre. The latter two would leave Nortec Collective in 2002. Nortec Collective's second album, Tijuana Sessions, Vol. 3, (Nacional Records) received much critical praise and was nominated for two Latin Grammy awards in 2006. In 2008, Nortec Collective ceased to function as a proper collective, with the various individual projects performing and recording separately. According to the Collective's Myspace page, \"For the time being, Nortec Collective has decided to release music separately \u2026\" and \"Until further notice, there will be not be any bookings for Nortec, Nortec Collective or Colectivo Nortec with the full four member line-up.\" The various individual projects went on to release and perform separately. 2008's Tijuana Sound Machine by Bostich and Fussible (also Nacional Records) was nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Latin Rock/Alternative Album. The Nortec Collective has borrowed several elements of Banda music sub-culture and have used them both in their songs (Narcoteque, Almada) and in their visuals and album covers."@en ;

The name VIA Gra is both a reference to the drug Viagra and a play on words, since the first three letters stand for \"vocal-instrumental ensemble\" in Ukrainian, and \"hra\" means \"game\" in Ukrainian and it is also kind of a signature of the surnames of the two first girls of the group, VI-nnitskay-A and GRA-novskaya, the originally used maiden name of Nadya Meikher. Nu Virgos was a Ukrainian girl group that hit the charts in these countries in September 2000 with their first single \"Popytka No. 5\". Their first success outside the Russian language area was in May 2004 with the single \"Stop! Stop! Stop!\", an English version of their 2002 Russian song. The group is known for their frequent lineup changes, with 13 different individuals having at one time been in the group. The group was co-created by Dmitriy Kostyuk and Konstantin Meladze. Kostyuk is the manager of the group and the co-producer of the group's albums. Meladze is the writer of the group's songs and the co-producer of the group's albums."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Okkervil River is an American rock band led by singer-songwriter Will Sheff. Formed in Austin, Texas in 1998, the band takes its name from a short story by Russian author Tatyana Tolstaya set on the river in St Petersburg. They began as a trio made up of Sheff and friends he'd met in his native state of New Hampshire but, over time, have gone through many lineups. Okkervil River self-released their first album, Stars Too Small to Use, which led them to the South by Southwest music festival. After recording their first album in a garage, they signed with Jagjaguwar. They continued by releasing four more albums, including the critically lauded concept album Black Sheep Boy. After a period of touring for Black Sheep Boy, Okkervil River followed up with The Stage Names. The album sold 10,000 in its opening week in the United States. The group released a free covers album, Golden Opportunities Mixtape from their live performances. The band has garnered positive critical reception. They have appeared on the talk show Late Night with Conan O'Brien and have performed with acts such as The Decemberists, The New Pornographers, The National, and Lou Reed. Okkervil River released the album The Stand Ins on 9 September 2008. They promoted the release with a series of cover songs from the album on YouTube by people they've met as a band. Their 2010 collaboration as a backing band with psychedelic rocker Roky Erickson yielded True Love Cast Out All Evil. On 10 May 2011, Okkervil River released their sixth full-length album, I Am Very Far, which peaked at No. 32 on the Billboard 200. The band released their seventh album, The Silver Gymnasium, on 3 September 2013. The album peaked at No. 66 on the Billboard 200. The band\u2019s most recent album, Away, was released on September 9th, 2016 on ATO Records."@en ;

After the Lennons' move to New York, they began collaborating with Elephant's Memory, under the moniker of the \"Plastic Ono Elephant's Memory Band\". Lennon's collaborations continued under similar names, until the winding down of the concept in 1974.

	dbo:abstract	"Thirty Seconds to Mars (commonly stylized as 30 Seconds to Mars) is an American rock band from Los Angeles, California, formed in 1998. The band consists of Jared Leto (lead vocals, guitar, bass, keyboards), Shannon Leto (drums, percussion) and Tomo Mili\u010Devi\u0107 (lead guitar, bass, violin, keyboards, other instruments). The band's debut album, 30 Seconds to Mars (2002), was produced by Bob Ezrin and released to positive reviews but only to limited commercial success. The band achieved worldwide fame with the release of their second album A Beautiful Lie (2005), which received multiple certifications all over the world, including platinum in the United States. Their next release, This Is War (2009), showed a dramatic evolution in the band's musical style, as they incorporated experimental music as well as eclectic influences. The recording process of the album was marked by a legal dispute with record label EMI that eventually became the subject of the documentary film Artifact (2012). Thirty Seconds to Mars then moved to Universal Music and released the fourth album, Love, Lust, Faith and Dreams (2013), to critical and commercial success. As of September 2014, the band has sold over 15 million albums worldwide. Thirty Seconds to Mars has consistently enjoyed sold out tours and numerous headlining festival slots. The band is noted for its energetic live performances and for fusing many music genres. They have been compared to the sounds of bands such as Pink Floyd, The Cure, Tool, and U2, for their philosophical and spiritual lyrics, concept albums and their use of experimental music. Thirty Seconds to Mars has received several awards and accolades throughout their career, including a Guinness World Record, and has been included in the Kerrang! list of best artists of the 2000s."@en ;

Formed in 2000 by vocalist and guitarist Andrew Stockdale, bassist and keyboardist Chris Ross, and drummer Myles Heskett, the group currently includes Stockdale, bassist and keyboardist Ian Peres, and touring drummer Alex Carapetis. Wolfmother released their self-titled debut album Wolfmother in Australia in 2005, and internationally in 2006, which has since sold over 1.5 million copies worldwide and won the band a number of industry awards. Ross and Heskett left the band in 2008. Stockdale returned with a new lineup featuring Peres, rhythm guitarist Aidan Nemeth and drummer Dave Atkins in 2009, releasing Cosmic Egg later in the year. After more personnel changes, the group's planned third album was released in 2013 as Keep Moving, a Stockdale solo album. Later that year, Wolfmother returned as a trio featuring Peres and drummer Vin Steele for 2014's New Crown. The band's fourth album, Victorious, featured two guest drummers and was released in 2016. Wolfmother have been categorised by various commentators within the genres of hard rock, heavy metal, stoner rock and psychedelic rock. They are often compared to influential classic rock and metal bands from the 1960s and 1970s, including Led Zeppelin, Black Sabbath, Blue Cheer and AC/DC. Frontman Stockdale has typically led songwriting for the group, although the material on the band's debut album was co-credited to Ross and Heskett. Stockdale also produced New Crown and performed bass on Victorious."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"XP8 was an Italian electronic group. The band started in 2001 as a trio, composed of Marco Visconti, Marko Resurreccion, and singer Paul Toohill. The group self-released an album, Forgive on MP3.com. When they signed to the Polish label Black Flames Records, their album was released as Forgive[n] in May 2004. An EP of new material, RE_Productions, was released five months later. In 2005, the band released their second album, Hrs:Min:Sec, on the German label Infacted Recordings. Toohill left the band in 2007, to work on his solo project, Generator. He is also the main singer for a Nitzer Ebb tribute band called \"Muscle And Hate\". Their third album, The Art of Revenge, was released in January 2008 on Infacted. It was also licensed to Sigsaly Transmissions for North America and Gravitator Records for Russia the same year. A music video, the band's first, was produced for the album's title track. Over the years, the band played all over Europe, from their native Italy to Russia, as well as performing at festivals like Wave-Gotik-Treffen in Germany. In 2008, XP8 also reached US shores for the first time with their live show, supporting System Syn on a one-month promotional tour. The following year they played at the Kinetik Festival in Canada, and begun working on their fourth studio album Drop The Mask, which was released in early 2010 once again by Infacted Recordings, with the digital-only Want It coming up just a few months before.Straying away from a pure dancefloor sound, the band experimented also with different approaches to electronica, and the album immediately received good praises by the press, consecrating it as the most mature XP8 release to date.Soon afterwards the album was licensed to Metropolis Records for a North American released and peaked at number 1 on the label's mailorder a week before its street date, while a limited digipack edition with a bonus CD was released in Japan by Deathwatch Asia. XP8 is also well known for their remixes, having reworked tracks of several other bands, including Steve Aoki, Attrition, Mortiis, and Icon of Coil, and countless others. In 2013, XP8 released the crowd-funded concept album Adrenochrome, which they described as their best effort to date, without any record label support. Everything came to a grinding halt in 2014 when the band decided to disband, quoting various reasons for this decision, among them the dwindling interest in alternative/industrial dance music, a trend that had a long run for almost two decades but that eventually ran dry. In an interview, Visconti also stated that \u201C[...] no one wants to be the old guy in a room full of kids looking at you like a dinosaur: I remember vividly making fun of those old goths that simply didn\u2019t want to get the fuck out of MY clubs a decade ago, and the last thing I wanted to become was one of them.\u201D  - clearly pointing out the necessity to make space for a younger generation to make things vital and vibrant once again. Before disbanding, XP8 released a series of 3 EPs over a period of 9 months, each released tied to one of the phases of the Alchemical process: the three releases went on to be praised as the band's best material by critics and fans alike, proving how the Italian duo left a mark on the industrial scene for years and years to come. Steven Gullotta at Brutal Resonance stated that \"XP8 may be dead, but their music will forever hold a place within my soul\", giving the band a good send off."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"(For other uses, see Younger Brother (disambiguation).) Younger Brother is an electronic duo formed in 2003 by Simon Posford and Benji Vaughan. Their debut album A Flock of Bleeps was released in 2003, followed by The Last Days of Gravity in 2007 and Vaccine in 2011. After making a remix for a charity record, Simon Posford (Shpongle, Hallucinogen) and Benji Vaughan (Prometheus) decided to come together in the studio to create their own type of electronic music that has been described as \"unclassifiable.\" The album A Flock of Bleeps released on Twisted Records became a cult classic in the underground electronica scene and included such tracks as \u2018Crumblenaut\u2019 and \u2018Finger\u2019. This led to massive demand to see them live and they have played shows from London to Tokyo, New York to Moscow. Inspired by the live shows Simon and Benji decided to move away from the pure electronic sound of the first album A Flock of Bleeps and create a more organic sound. Having no band, they played the instruments themselves and recruited long-time friend and former Leftfield vocalist Ruu Campbell to perform the vocals. The resulting album was Last Days of Gravity (with artwork made by the legendary Storm Thorgerson whose work has graced albums by Pink Floyd, Alan Parsons, and Led Zeppelin, among many others) release in 2007 narrowly missed a nomination for the 2008 Mercury Music Prize and received masses of positive press. They also returned to play shows with the \"Younger Brother Live\" band in Boulder and Denver, Colorado and in California, which included Marc Brownstein (The Disco Biscuits, Electron) on bass, Tom Hamilton (Brothers Past, The American Babies, Electron) on guitar, and Joe Russo (The Benevento/Russo Duo, Furthur, Bustle In Your Hedgerow, The American Babies, Electron) on drums in Japan, the US and played a sell out show to 3,000 people at the Brixton Academy, London. 2009 saw Younger Brother produce \"Phoenix in Dynamite Sky\" for British cult film Heartless, directed by Philip Ridley and due for release in 2010. A successful US tour took place in July, which included a headline set at the Camp Bisco Festival and saw them play to 8,000 people. Their third album Vaccine, recorded with its U.S. band lineup (Marc Brownstein - the Disco Biscuits, Joe Russo (musician) - Benevento/Russo Duo/Furthur (band) & Tom Hamilton - Brothers Past), became available via iTunes on 4 April 2011 and is available streaming from My Old Kentucky Blog. In 2014 the band developed an app for mobile devices and released an alternate album of remixes titled Vaccine Electronic as a free stream for users who installed it. On 16 August 2014 Benji Vaughn stated on Younger Brothers' Facebook page that he would \"be going quiet for a while\" and that \"it's time to disappear for a few years\". The band's name is taken from a Kogi prophecy; the Kogi regarded themselves as the Older Brother and say that the destruction of the Earth and environment would be by Westerners called Younger Brother. Simon Posford and Benji Vaughan describe this in the Twisted DVD from 2007 during an interview. Fragments from this prophecy are found in the song \"Evil and Harm\"."@en ;

Hughes and Homme are the only permanent members of the band, with Homme rarely performing at live shows due to commitments to his other bands. The band's current touring line-up includes Hughes alongside Dave Catching (guitar), Eden Galindo (guitar), Matt McJunkins (bass) and Jorma Vik (drums). Despite their name, Eagles of Death Metal are not a death metal band and the name is intended to be humorous. In a 2003 interview Homme described the sound of the band as a combination of \"bluegrass slide guitar mixed with stripper drum beats and Canned Heat vocals.\" Hughes is known for his enthusiastic interaction with audiences at live performances. While the band were on stage at Le Bataclan in Paris, France, on November 13, 2015, the audience was attacked by terrorists wielding automatic rifles, grenades and suicide vests. The death toll inside the venue was 89, including the group's merchandise manager, but the band members escaped safely out of the venue via a door backstage."@en ;

dbr:On_Broken_Wings	rdf:type	dbo:Band ;

	dbo:abstract	"On Broken Wings is an American metalcore band from Hull, Massachusetts that formed in 2001. Often credited with pioneering the sound, and coining the term, of \"moshcore\", a term originally used by the band to describe their fusion of metal with elements of post-hardcore and hardcore breakdowns. They are arguably the first deathcore band. After the self-released Number One Beautiful EP, they caught the attention of Eulogy Recordings, where they would then release 2 full-length albums over the next 5 years, 2003's 'Some of us may Never see the World' and 2005's 'It's all a Long Goodbye'. During this time, On Broken Wings was also subject to a variety of controversies, mostly concerning their unusually violent live shows and the band's apparent encouragement of crowd violence. As a result, the band is still banned from many clubs and venues across the United States. In early 2007, On Broken Wings released an EP entitled Going Down which contained the original Number One Beautiful EP as well as 4 new songs. In an ironic twist, the title of the EP was soon considered foreshadowing as the band announced an indefinite hiatus mainly due to interest in other projects. Many considered OBW to have split up for good until a new year rolled around... After a long hiatus, 2008 finally sees the band reuniting and doing some serious touring with the 'Mosh Lives' tour featuring headliners, Emmure and other metalcore acts such as Recon, Ligeia and on select dates, Red I Flight and Endwell."@en ;

Their lyrics (mostly written by Bengtsson, Rasmusson, Berger and Nyl\u00E9n) cover a wide range, frommarxist analysis and invitations to revolution to satire, art criticism, 1940s childhood nostalgia, images from daily life and experimental pop art works. A recurring theme, at least in their early works, is criticism of Saltsj\u00F6badsandan; the Swedish model of mixing capitalism with socialism through cooperation rather than conflict between government, large corporations and unions. One song on this theme, \"Den ena handen vet vad den andra g\u00F6r\", was covered by punk band Ebba Gr\u00F6n (renamed \"Staten och kapitalet\", with some of the lyrics omitted) and became a hit in 1980.

	dbo:abstract	"InI was a hip hop group composed of Rob-O, Grap Luva, Ras G a.k.a. I Love H.I.M.,Marco Polo, now known as Jolomite, and DJ Boodakhan. The group started working on their debut album together with producer Pete Rock in the mid-90s, and signed a deal with Rock's new found imprint Soul Brother Records through Elektra. The record company eventually shelved the album, releasing only one 12\" single in 1996. The track \"Fakin' Jax\", produced and featuring Pete Rock, became an underground hit. The album eventually became one of the most bootlegged album in hip-hop's history, but in 2003 it saw an official release it was included on Lost & Found: Hip Hop Underground Soul Classics, a double LP of Pete Rock's mid-1990s production work, originally canceled by Elektra Records. InI had actually called their debut album \"InI - \"The Life I Live\", although the bootlegged name is contrary stating \"Centre Of Attention\", which is incorrect. Although most people may think Grap Luva is the master of InI, it was actually Rob-O as he was the \"brainchild\" of the work. Rob was highly skilled, as a lyricist & vocalist. Despite the fact that Pete Rock is not an official member of the group, it is synonymous with his name, as he produced almost every track of Center of Attention, and Grap Luva is his younger brother. Rock also had verses on two songs (Fakin Jax & Worldwide) in the albums with additional ad-libs and background vocals on basically every track. InI had released a demo-tape called \"Krossroads\", and \"Concerned\", grap describes this as their earlist tapes. Concerned appears to be called \"For Your Own Concern\" although it was actually called \"Concerned\" by the InI group. Grap's man from France was responsible for sharing concerned. \"The beat is sick\" - Grap, in the song they talk about safe sex; thus the title, to be concerned. The rhyme that rob-o had spit on \"To each his own\" was the rhyme he had spit on \"Concerned\".After Center of Attention got shelved the group members went their separate ways, while only two of them stayed on the music scene to pursue solo careers. Grap Luva released a few limited 12\" singles in the new millennium and aspired to being his real interest in being a beat boy and producing. He appeared, and produced on various albums and singles from artists such as DJ Spinna, J-Live, Pete Rock, Lone Catalysts, Kev Brown and Marley Marl. Rob-O released many singles through an imprint called St. Nick Entertainment and in 2006 he came out with a debut album called \"Rhyme Pro\", a mix of the older 12\" singles with a few new songs sprinkled throughout."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Major Organ and the Adding Machine is an Elephant 6 supergroup led by the elusive and possibly fictional Major Organ. The liner notes of the band's debut album, Major Organ and the Adding Machine, leave it a mystery as to who is officially featured. When performing live on the Holiday Surprise Tour, the members of the band wore paper masks to maintain their anonymity. It is believed that the main contributors are Jeff Mangum, Julian Koster, Robert Schneider, and Kevin Barnes, whose vocals are most obviously present on the album, but a number of other Elephant 6 musicians are believed to have contributed too, including members of The Olivia Tremor Control, Elf Power, and Of Montreal. In 1997, when thought to be a side-project of Jeff Mangum and Julian Koster, Major Organ and the Adding Machine contributed a cover of Louis Armstrong's What a Wonderful World to a Kindercore Records Christmas compilation. Over the next few years, they recorded a self-titled album and released it on Orange Twin Records in 2001. A trailer for a Major Organ and the Adding Machine film was shown at the 40 Watt Club on May 5, 2007 and August 11, 2007. The film was premiered on October 7, 2008 and shown at every show on the Holiday Surprise Tour in the following weeks. The film contains no dialogue and is accompanied by alternate arrangements of songs from the Major Organ and the Adding Machine album. An expanded version of the album, including a DVD of the film, was released on September 14, 2010, although some consumers received their copies before the announced release date. The films credits, as well as the commentary, seemingly confirm the suspected roster of Elephant Six musicians."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Moistboyz is an American hard rock band formed in New Hope, Pennsylvania in 1991 by Guy Heller and Mickey Melchiondo. Moistboyz music is typically fast-paced punk/metal, combining stream-of-consciousness lyrics with aggressive rock guitar riffs. The band's current touring lineup includes Stephen Haas (guitar), as well as Mondo Generator rhythm section Nick Oliveri (bass) and Hoss Wright (drums). As in Melchiondo's band Ween, both he and Heller assume aliases: Mickey Moist and Dickie Moist. Moistboyz have released five studio records starting with the 1994 EP Moistboyz. A full-length album, Moistboyz II, followed in 1996. Recorded by Heller (vocals/lyrics) and Melchiondo (guitar/music) using drum machine and a lo-fi sensibility, both records were originally released on the Beastie Boys label, Grand Royal. In 2005, these first two records were combined and released as one album, Moistboyz I+II] on Sanctuary Records, now on Chocodog Records. In 2002, Moistboyz III was released on Mike Patton's label, Ipecac Records. This is the first Moistboyz record to feature songs with real drums, performed by Lou Croschetti. Moistboyz IV was released in 2005 on Sanctuary Records. The album was mixed by Chris Shaw, features Claude Coleman, Jr. on drums, and bass by producer Andrew Weiss on Fuck You. In 2013, Moistboyz V was released on Heller and Melchiondo's label, Neverman Records, distributed by MVD Audio. Recording started in late 2012 in New Hope, PA and finished in Lago Vista, TX in early 2013. It was produced and engineered by Melchiondo, and mixed by Stephen Haas. Moistboyz V covers multiple musical styles, such as the southern rock-influenced Down on the Farm and the alt ballad \"My Time to Die\". Guest musicians include Chuck Treece (drums) on \"Protect and Serve\", \"Medusa\", \"Garbageman\" and Joe Kramer (guitar) on \"Protect and Serve\", \"Chickendick\", \"Down on the Farm\" and \"My Time to Die\"."@en ;

	foaf:name	"Chick Corea Elektric Band"@en ;
	dbo:abstract	"Chick Corea Elektric Band is a jazz fusion band, led by pianist Chick Corea. Following the demise of Return to Forever, Corea established the musical ensemble in 1986. Following a long hiatus, the band reunited to produce To the Stars in 2004. The band's debut album can be described as \"jazz-rock\", though it is much closer to traditional jazz than the jazz-rock albums of the 1970s. The keyboard sounds on the album are typical for the mid-1980s. The drums played by Dave Weckl dominate the album's sound, with the guitar duties split between Scott Henderson and Carlos Rios. The second album, Light Years (1987) is more funk-oriented than its predecessor. Saxophonist Eric Marienthal joins the band and Frank Gambale replaces Henderson and Rios (who still plays on some tracks) to form what is considered the band's definitive lineup. The third album, Eye of the Beholder, relies on softer sounds. Here Corea relies on acoustic piano, with synthesizers largely in the background. Gambale also plays acoustic guitar on some tracks, lending a Flamenco-influenced sound to pieces like \"Eternal Child.\" The Elektric Band's fourth album, Inside Out (1990), features some compositions that fall in the post-bop rather than the fusion category. The four-part piece \"Tale of Daring\", which closes the album, relies on unconventional melodies and relatively free improvisation. But two other compositions, the title track and \"Kicker,\" are more traditional fusion pieces. Corea still uses mostly acoustic piano, but Gambale plays electric guitar throughout. The last album featuring the band's traditional lineup was Beneath the Mask (1991), a return to the electric jazz-funk of the second album. For the next album, Elektric Band II: Paint the World (1993), only Corea and Marienthal returned from the original lineup. Gary Novak became the new drummer, Jimmy Earl took the bass, and Mike Miller played guitar. The album's style can be described as modern jazz, crossing between post-bop and fusion. In 1996, the band teamed up with Steve Vai's Monsters to record a version of \"Rumble\" from West Side Story for the RCA Victor tribute album called The Songs of West Side Story. The original members reunited in 2004 for To the Stars (2004), which is stylistically close to the avant-garde and post-bop on Inside Out. After the final studio album the band has toured also with Victor Wooten who has replaced Patitucci, who returned to the band in the middle of 2016."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Harsh Reality are a little-known, proto-prog band formed in Stevenage, Hertfordshire in 1968 out of the remnants of the Freightliner Blues Band (formerly the Revolution). The band consisted of Mark Griffiths and Dave Jenkins on guitars, Alan Greed on lead vocals and organ, Roger Swallow on drums, and Steve Miller on bass and backing vocals. They released a single for Philips Records in 1968 (\"Tobacco Ash Sunday\" / \"How Do You Feel\") before releasing their only album, Heaven and Hell, also on Philips in 1969. A final single followed soon after, before the band split in 1969. Their Heaven and Hell LP is now a highly-sought rarity, selling for hundreds of pounds between eager collectors. For this reason, Harsh Reality is somewhat famous/infamous in collecting circles. Though seen as part of the proto-progressive rock era, their work represented a marriage between the sounds of Procol Harum, Traffic and early Deep Purple. Following the band's demise, Roger Swallow played with Principal Edwards Magic Theatre, Matthews Southern Comfort, Plainsong, Albion Country Band, and Al Stewart; before moving to California and establishing himself as an electronic musician, songwriter and entrepreneur. Alan Greed went on to work with Ray Russell on the Rock Workshop albums, and as a session singer. Greed later fronted the jazz/progressive outfit, The Running Man. A self-titled album was released in the UK on the Neon record label in 1972. Mark Griffiths has worked with Matthews Southern Comfort, Jonathan Kelly, Al Stewart, David Essex, The Everly Brothers, and Cliff Richard & The Shadows. The rest of the band also went into session work. The song \"Tobacco Ash Sunday\" was covered by Paul Weller for AOL Sessions. Heaven and Hell will be reissued officially for the first time on CD by Esoteric Recordings on 26 September 2011, with four bonus tracks and a 16-page booklet containing a lengthy interview with the band."@en ;

In 1992, the group reinvented itself under the name M\u00EDriam Cruz y Las Chicas. The first year under that name, they produced a successful album entitled Nueva Vida featuring a hitsong written by Juan Luis Guerra, \"Te Propongo.\" Later that year, \"La Loba\" was also well received by merengue fans and quickly became another hit. A European tour (1993-1994) soon followed. In 1994 Miriam Cruz y Las Chicas scored another hit with the song \"Con Agua de Sal (OTI),\" and 1995 included another successful European tour. Meanwhile, the original name was kept alive by a music industry manager who discovered a group of new and talented young ladies who would carry the torch for Las Chicas del Can and leave their own mark on merengue music. In 1993, Michell Flores, Grissel Baez and Flor\u00E1ngel del Villar teamed up to keep the legacy alive. Due to the situation not entirely clear among fans, the new girls were hailed as the \"Monumental\". They started traveling around the globe, covering the band's original repertoire with songs like \"Juana la Cubana\". This 2nd line-up of Las Chicas Del Can quickly became a successful act in their own right with hit tunes such as \"Voy Pa'll\u00E1,\" \"Hacer El Amor Con Otro,\" \"Celoso,\" \"Explosivo\" and \"Sin Compromiso.\" After the albums \"Botando Chispas\" (1994) and \"Derramando Sue\u00F1os\" (1996) lead singer Michell Flores went solo and the 2nd line-up of Las Chicas del Can disbanded in 1998. Las Chicas del Can was eventually reformed a third time in 1999, but this particular group was never able to achieve the success of earlier line-ups. To this date, the first line-up of Las Chicas Del Can (which featured M\u00EDriam Cruz, Eunice Betances and Theresa Dom\u00EDnguez) has proven to be the most successful line-up."@en ;

It featured a diverse selection of songs ranging from pure pop to straight-up hip-hop. The following year they released a follow-up in the form of a mixtape CD called Cut Some Static. Cut Some Static was an album-length compilation of previously unreleased tracks, but was not released as a proper album. It was not sold at retail, came packaged with home-computer printed labels, and featured members of the band introducing tracks, to keep the underground mixtape feel. Musically, it also featured a grittier, more rap-oriented sound, and more explicit lyrics. Marty James was featured on the hook of The Federation's 2006 west coast club anthem \"I Wear My Stunna Glasses at Night\". Since that time he has also become an accomplished writer and producer having worked with JR Rotem, E-40, Far East Movement Sean Kingston, Baby Bash, Paula DeAnda, Diane Warren, Rick Rock, Lil Jon, The Grouch, DJ Felli Fel, Jessi Malay, MoZella, Laze & Royal, The Stooie Brothers and more. In 2007, he co-wrote \"What Is It\" by Baby Bash ft. Sean Kingston. In May 2008 One Block Radius released the single \"You Got Me\" on Property Music Group (Marty James own label). James also produced the song. Their major label debut, One Block Radius spent one week on the Billboard Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart, at number 86."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"C-Tec was a band originally formed as a side project in 1995 by Jean-Luc De Meyer (of Front 242), Jonathan Sharp (of New Mind), and Ged Denton (of Crisis NTI) as The Cyber-Tec Project. The name was taken from Cyber-Tec Records, who released their first album. This EP was also released on Fifth Column Records in the US. After this release, Jonathan Sharp left the band (due to problems with Cyber-Tec Records manager Paul M. Green), and Marc Heal (of Cubanate) joined as a full-time member. The band had been conceived as a one-off project, but the members at this point decided to pursue further material. In 1997, after shortening their name to C-Tec, they released a full album, Darker, on the US industrial Wax Trax! label. C-Tec existed during the late 1990s hiatus in the Front 242 line-up, with De Meyer (the original lead singer in 242) apparently leaving that band for a period. The band toured North America twice in 1998 with a hybrid lineup featuring other members of Cubanate and Julian Beeston, one time drummer in Nitzer Ebb. The second album, Cut, was released in 2000 on SPV imprint Synthetic Symphony. The album was originally slated for US release on Wax Trax! but the label closed around this time. Thereby, Cut never had an official American release. In terms of how C-Tec sounded, Darker contains a surprisingly downbeat, moody collection of songs, showing strong electronic influences but with more ambient textures than would be suggested by the industrial music backgrounds of the main participants. Cut is faster in tempo, with De Meyer\u2019s vocal mixed low. Most of the material on the two full-length C-Tec albums was co-written by Marc Heal and Jean-Luc De Meyer. Since Cut, C-Tec appears to have been inactive, though lead singer Jean-Luc De Meyer later resurfaced with a new Front 242 album in 2003."@en ;

The band was influenced by the sounds and styles of bands such as Olneyville Sound System and Lightning Bolt.

The San Francisco Bay Guardian described their live sound as \u201CKorean folk drumming gone punk.\u201D Both members would appear onstage in outlandish outfits that corresponded with their colorful pseudonyms. The band broke up in 2003. On their message board they announced their disbanding simply: Mommy and daddy still love you but they just can't stay married. We hope this doesn't put a damper on your childhood but we think you'll be just fine. Dwyer went on to play with Coachwhips, Yikes! and The Hospitals. He is currently playing with Thee Oh Sees.

	dbo:abstract	"Enthroned is a black metal band formed in Charleroi in 1993 by Cernunnos. He soon recruited guitarist Tsebaoth and a vocalist from grindcore/black metal band Hecate who stayed until the end of December 1993. Then bassist/vocalist Sabathan joined. The band released a five-track demo tape in mid-1994 which brought them to the attention of several independent labels. A 7-inch split EP with Ancient Rites was then released by the underground label Afterdark Records. After the label's demise, Evil Alliance Records (a sub-label of Osmose Productions) released Enthroned's first full-length release, Prophecies of Pagan Fire. Shortly thereafter, the band enlisted second guitarist Nornagest. Eventually, Tseboath was replaced by Nebiros. In 1996, along with Ancient Rites and Bewitched, Enthroned began an extensive tour of Europe. In April 1997, as Enthroned was to begin recording Towards the Skullthrone of Satan, Cernunnos hanged himself. Enthroned recorded the album with a session drummer in honor of Cernunnos and performed at the Dragons Blaze festival with newly acquired drummer Namroth Blackthorn. In April 1998, the band toured the European continent with Dark Funeral and also released the mini CD Regie Axese, which was dedicated to their former drummer Cernunnos. Later that year, they toured again with labelmates Hecate Enthroned and Usurper. At the close of 1998, the band entered Abyss Studios (Sweden) to record The Apocalypse Manifesto. The band's third album was released in May 1999 and dealt with the biblical concept of the Apocalypse as interpreted by a Norse mythological perspective. Enthroned rounded off the 20th Century on tour with Marduk and continued to tour in Europe. In 2000, the band parted ways with Nebiros and recruited Nerath Daemon as their new guitarist, went on a German mini tour followed by several other European shows and recorded Armoured Bestial Hell at Real Sound Studio (Germany). This fourth album was released in April 2001. Namroth Blackthorn was replaced by Alsvid from the French black metal band Seth. Enthroned continued to play many live gigs in and around Europe, as well as in the US. In early 2002, Enthroned signed to Napalm Records releasing their fifth full-length recording, Carnage in Worlds Beyond, later that year. In June 2003, Nguaroth (guitars) and Glaurung (drums) joined Enthroned, which played a South American tour and released their sixth album, XES Haereticum. In 2005, Enthroned released their first official live album, Black Goat Ritual, recorded during their tour of Brazil. Enthroned parted ways with longtime vocalist Sabathan, at which time Nornagest took over the vocals and Phorgath joined the band on bass. In June 2007, Enthroned recorded their seventh album Tetra Karcist, seeing the return of old drummer Alsvid for the studio sessions. Ahephahim joined as the new official drummer in June 2007 and Enthroned signed with Regain Records in January 2008. At this time, some members of the band opened a recording studio, Blackout Multimedia. In the meantime, Ahephaim and Nguaroth left the band due to lack of time and were replaced by ex-Gorgoroth drummer Garghuf. Nerath Daemon took back the position he left five years ago in Enthroned, changing his name to Neraath. Enthroned's eight album, Pentagrammaton, was released on 22 March 2010. Since then, Nornagest has given up playing guitar in live performances, due to chronic tendonitis in his wrist, and has instead become the band's frontman. Former members Lord Sabathan and Nguaroth joined the band for a one-off live performance in 2010 as an act of reconciliation. In September 2011, Enthroned announce that their collaboration with Regain Records has ended while the band was busy recording their ninth studio album."@en ;

This album is a return to roots for Bill Nershi, who says \"this band takes the music back to the kind of shows SCI did when it began.\""@en ;

The band's original members consisted of vocalist Tom Meighan, guitarist and vocalist Sergio Pizzorno, guitarist Chris Karloff, and bassist Chris Edwards. The band's line-up was completed by drummer Ian Matthews in 2004 after a string of session drummers. Karloff left the band in 2006 and founded a new band called Black Onassis. Jay Mehler joined as touring lead guitarist in 2006. Mehler left the band for Liam Gallagher's Beady Eye in 2013. In 2010 and 2014, Kasabian won the Q Awards for 'Best Act in the World Today', while they were also named \"Best Live Act\" at the 2014 Q Awards and the 2007 NME Awards. The band's music is often described as \"indie rock\", but Pizzorno has said he \"hates indie bands\" and does not feel Kasabian fit into that category. Kasabian have released five studio albums \u2013 Kasabian (2004), Empire (2006), West Ryder Pauper Lunatic Asylum (2009), Velociraptor! (2011), and 48:13 (2014). They are due to release their sixth album in 2017. The band's music has been described as a mix between The Stone Roses and Primal Scream with the swagger of Oasis. Their music has won them several awards and recognition in the media, including a Brit Award in 2010 for Best British Group, and their live performances have received praise, the most notable of which was their appearance as headliners at the 2014 Glastonbury Festival."@en ;

The band currently consists of vocalist Matthew Shultz, rhythm guitarist Brad Shultz, drummer Jared Champion and bassist Daniel Tichenor, as well as touring keyboardist/guitarist Matthan Minster and touring lead guitarist Nick Bockrath. Lincoln Parish served as the band's lead guitarist from their formation in 2006 until December 2013, when he left on good terms to pursue a career in producing. The band's first album, Cage the Elephant, was released in 2008 to much success, spawning several successful radio singles and gained the band a large following in both the United States and the United Kingdom. Cage the Elephant are known for energetic live performances and for possessing an eclectic sound. The band's first album is influenced by classic rock, funk, and blues music. However, the band's second album, Thank You, Happy Birthday, displayed heavy influence by punk rock and bands such as the Pixies and Nirvana, while Melophobia was a concerted effort by the band to find its own distinct musical identity, and earned them a Grammy Award nomination in 2015 for Best Alternative Music Album. Cage the Elephant's fourth album, Tell Me I'm Pretty, produced by Dan Auerbach, was released on December 18, 2015 after being announced on October 5, 2015."@en ;

GBH were early pioneers of English street punk, often nicknamed \"UK82\", along with Discharge, Broken Bones, The Exploited and The Varukers. GBH have gone on to influence several punk rock musicians. The name GBH was inspired by then-bassist Sean McCarthy's trial for grievous bodily harm. Though the core line up of Colin, Ross and Jock has stayed the same throughout their history the drum stool has been occupied by a number of incumbents following Wilf's departure after the Midnight Madness and Beyond album and Oh No It's GBH again 12\" ep. 1986 saw the arrival of German drummer Kai Reder who played on three albums and an EP (No Need To Panic, A Fridge Too Far and From Here To Reality, as well as the \"Wot A Bargain\" 12\"), Kai was then replaced by American, Joe \"Fish\" Montanero for one album (Church of The Truly Warped), this was the band's last release for the Rough Justice label. The drum stool was then occupied from around 1994 by former Bomb Disneyland/Bomb Everything drummer Scott Preece, who has remained to this day and played on all releases since."@en ;

Shortly thereafter, Domino joined forces with Jordan Galland, and formed DOMINO. The band recorded an EP with Mark Ronson and toured for three years with the likes of Gang of Four and Lily Allen. The band was also featured in Lena Dunham's indie movie, Tiny Furniture.

The group was formed as a result of a 1999 talent contest called \"Avex Dream 2000\". Originally a three-piece group consisting of Mai Matsumuro, Kana Tachibana, and Yu Hasebe, the group has undergone many changes since its debut in 2000 on the Avex Trax label, and none of the original trio remain. The original trio sold over 950,700 records, and in total the group has sold over 1,100,000 records over the span of 10 years. On July 7, 2002, the main lyricist Mai Matsumuro left the group to pursue a solo career. After Matsumuro's departure, Avex held another audition to replace Matsumuro. Instead of one, six new members won the audition, resulting in an eight-member (Dream) group with the debut single \"Music is My Thing\". On March 2004, Risa Ai left to pursue a solo career. They became a 7-member group as performed this way until 2007. During this time, the band's name changed from dream to DRM. In August 2008, Yu Hasebe left the group to pursue a solo career, leaving Kana Tachibana behind as the only original member of dream. Afterward, DRM became Dream again. In August 2010, Dream released their official major re-debut single, \"My Way: Ulala\" on the Rhythm Zone label. On November 24, 2010, Dream released their first album as a six-member group, titled Hands Up! on the Rhythm Zone label. On November 23, 2010, Tachibana announced that she would leave the group. This marked the departure of the last member of the original three-member group. She officially left the group on February 20, 2011. On March 30, 2012, Sayaka Yamamoto departed to pursue a solo career."@en ;

This song became a #14 hit single in the UK Singles Chart when released in December 1988, making M\u00FCnchener Freiheit a one-hit wonder there. Due to its December release and rich orchestral sound, \"Keeping the Dream Alive\" still receives a lot of airplay at Christmas time and can be found included on many Christmas compilation albums. In the United States the song failed to chart there when it was originally released, gaining favour with the American public only after it was featured in the soundtrack for the movie Say Anything.... The single has received additional exposure in the United States thanks to the singing talent contest American Idol on the Fox television network. The song has been used in recent seasons as a backdrop to video montages featuring contestants on the programme."@en ;

The band's music is characterized by studio experimentation, vocal harmonies, and an exploration of various genres which include freak folk, noise rock, ambient drone, and psychedelia. Records released under the name \"Animal Collective\" may include contributions from any or all of its members. In the example of Dibb, who often takes breaks from recording and performing with the band, his time off does not constitute full leave. The band members met in school and started recording together in various forms of collaboration from a young age. Originally a duo comprising Lennox and Portner, the collective was not officially established until all four members came together for the album Here Comes the Indian (2003). Previous collaborations between two or more members were then retroactively classified under Animal Collective's discography. In 1999, they established the record label Paw Tracks, issuing what is now considered their debut album, Spirit They're Gone, Spirit They've Vanished (2000), as well as work by other artists. In 2009, the band released their most commercially successful album, Merriweather Post Pavilion, which Uncut magazine called: \"one of the landmark American albums of the century so far\"."@en ;

The records consisted of collections of breaks, loops and samples, that could be used for mixing, remixing and producing. The later DJ Food albums have developed with shades of Latin, dub, techno, ambient, and Jungle. The 1995 album, A Recipe for Disaster was a conscious move away from the Jazz Brakes volumes to form more of an identity as an artist, and a remix album of tracks from all 6 LPs, entitled Refried Food was released the following year. The more recent release, Kaleidoscope, features guest artists including Bundy K. Brown (formerly of Tortoise, Directions in Music, Pullman) and voiceover artist and jazz poet, Ken Nordine."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Charalambides is an avant garde musical group originally from Houston, Texas, United States and lately of Austin, Texas. Formed in 1991 (under the short-lived name Mutual Admiration Society) by Tom Carter, Christina Carter and Kyle Silfer, they have followed in the footsteps of other Texas psychedelic music artists such as the 13th Floor Elevators, Red Crayola, and Jandek. Later members include Jason Bill and Heather Leigh Murray, but the band has long considered itself primarily a duo between Tom and Christina Carter. The name of the band derives from the surname of a customer at the record shop where Tom and Christina met. Their music contains elements typical of psychedelic music such as reverb, backwards recording, extended instrumental jamming and the use of found sounds. In addition to several major releases on labels such as Kranky, Eclipse Records, and Time-Lag Records, they have also released many small edition CD-Rs on their own Wholly Other label, and other small independent labels, some of which have later been re-issued (Our Bed is Green, and Historic Sixth Ward for example). Core members Tom Carter and Christina Carter are divorced but remain together as a musical unit. They have also released albums on Kranky and Eclipse Records under their own names, as well as several small edition CD-Rs. In addition the two have collaborated with numerous other musicians such as Loren Mazzacane Connors, Yellow Swans and Robert Horton."@en ;

The singer, Martin, living in Chicago at the time and Mark, the original guitarist living in Albany, NY came up with the idea for the band. They then asked the bassist Andrew and original drummer Scott who were living in Philadelphia to join up for a first practice which was held in Philadelphia in late 1998. After a few jam-packed weekends of practice, a first gig was set up in Philadelphia at Stalag 13 on June 13, 1999.

	dbo:abstract	"The Four Tops are an American vocal quartet from Detroit, Michigan who helped to define the city's Motown sound of the 1960s. The group's repertoire has included soul music, R&B, disco, adult contemporary, doo-wop, jazz, and show tunes. Founded as The Four Aims, lead singer Levi Stubbs, and groupmates Abdul \"Duke\" Fakir, Renaldo \"Obie\" Benson and Lawrence Payton remained together for over four decades, having gone from 1953 until 1997 without a change in personnel. The Four Tops were among a number of groups, including the Miracles, the Marvelettes, Martha and the Vandellas, the Temptations, and the Supremes, who established the Motown Sound around the world during the 1960s. They were notable for having Stubbs, a baritone, as their lead singer, whereas most male/mixed vocal groups of the time were fronted by a tenor. The group was the main male vocal group for the highly successful songwriting and production team of Holland\u2013Dozier\u2013Holland, who crafted a stream of hit singles on Motown. These included two Billboard Hot 100 number-one hits for the Tops: \"I Can't Help Myself (Sugar Pie Honey Bunch)\" in 1965 and \"Reach Out I'll Be There\" in 1966. After Holland-Dozier-Holland left Motown in 1967, the Four Tops were assigned to a number of producers, primarily Frank Wilson, but generally with less success. When Motown left Detroit in 1972 to move to Los Angeles, California, the Tops stayed in Detroit but signed a new recording deal with ABC Records' Dunhill imprint. Recording mainly in Los Angeles, they continued to have chart singles into the late 1970s, including the million-seller, \"Ain't No Woman\", their second release on Dunhill, produced by Steve Barri and composers Dennis Lambert and Brian Potter. In the 1980s, the Four Tops recorded for Casablanca Records, Arista Records and Motown, returning to that label on two occasions for brief stays. Apart from their Indestructible album (owned by Sony Music Entertainment), Universal Music Group controls the rights to their entire post-1963 catalog (through various mergers and acquisitions), as well as their 1956 single, \"Could It Be You\". A change of line-up was finally forced upon the group when Lawrence Payton died on June 20, 1997. The group initially continued as a three-piece under the name The Tops, before Theo Peoples (formerly of The Temptations) was recruited as the new fourth member. Peoples eventually took over the role of lead singer when Stubbs suffered a stroke in 2000, with Ronnie McNeir then joining the group. On July 1, 2005, Benson died of lung cancer with Payton's son Roquel Payton replacing him. Levi Stubbs died on October 17, 2008. Fakir, McNeir, Payton, and Harold \"Spike\" Bonhart, who replaced Peoples in 2011, are still performing together as the Four Tops. The 2016 Four Tops included Fakir as the only surviving founding member of the original group and Payton as a second-generation member."@en ;

They are signed to RCA Records globally and Columbia Records exclusively in the United States. The style of their early work, including their debut album Count Your Blessings, has primarily been described as deathcore, but they started to adopt a more eclectic style of metalcore on subsequent albums. Furthermore, their latest album That's the Spirit marked a shift in their sound to less aggressive rock music styles. Bring Me the Horizon released their debut album Count Your Blessings in 2006. Upon release, the album was met with great polarisation amongst the public and critical disdain. The band began to break away from their controversial sound with Suicide Season (2008), which proved to be a creative, critical and commercial turning point for the band. Bring Me the Horizon then released their third album There Is a Hell, Believe Me I've Seen It. There Is a Heaven, Let's Keep It a Secret. In 2010, propelling them to greater international fame, whilst incorporating influences from classical, electronica and pop. Their major label debut, Sempiternal achieved Gold certification in Australia (35,000) and Silver in the United Kingdom (60,000).

Dan Band has grown from the occasional jam session and Chicago-area gigs to performing for charities and non-profit organizations including the USO and Operation Iraqi Children, the latter of which was co-founded by Sinise in March 2004. They frequently visit military bases in the United States and abroad. Sinise is involved in building a memorial to America's three million, living, disabled veterans, at whose opening the band is expected to play."@en ;

The group has released two albums on each of the American indie labels Teenbeat Records and Absolutely Kosher, and their track \"All I do\" was prominently featured in the soundtrack for the major film Wicker Park. The group has developed a devoted following in Japan and Taiwan, and has toured there frequently. Although many artists append bonus tracks onto the end of Japanese album releases to discourage purchasers from buying cheaper US import versions, the overseas versions of +/- albums are usually quite different from the US versions - track lists can be rearranged, artwork with noticeable changes is used, and tracks from the US version can be replaced as well as augmented by bonus tracks."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Cowboys International (also stylised as Cowboys International\u00AE) were a new wave and synthpop band formed by vocalist and songwriter Ken Lockie that put out one album in 1979, the influential The Original Sin, and a handful of 45s before dissolving in 1980. The band can be considered as supergroup because they comprised many musicians with some trajectory in the punk and new wave scenes."@en ;
