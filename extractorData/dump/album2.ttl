It was recorded with engineer and co-producer Shawn Everett and mastered by Bob Ludwig. The album was released on March 25, 2014. The Belle Brigade's first album had received wide critical praise, but on their second album, the Gruskas wanted to pursue a less slickly produced and more individual sound. Their record company, Reprise Records, expressed dissatisfaction with the results, and ultimately the band took the record to independent ATO Records."@en .

Murdering Oscar was released on June 23, 2009 on Hood's own label, Ruth St. Records, and on ATO Records. The music on the album consists of noisy guitar chords and reverb on some tracks, while others also feature the piano. The album's lyrics address topics that affected Hood around the time Murdering Oscar's songs were written, such as the birth of his child and his success with the Drive-By Truckers. The album received mainly favorable reviews from critics, who praised it for being optimistic and mature in its handling of both positive and negative themes. Some critics also commended the album for addressing these themes in a compassionate and optimistic manner, and for being exceptionally personal compared to his previous work with the Drive-By Truckers. However, other critics criticized the album for being inferior to Hood's work with the Drive-By Truckers. Murdering Oscar peaked at No. 153 on the Billboard 200 Chart."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Playlist: The Very Best Of Rick Springfield is a compilation album by Rick Springfield, released by RCA Records in 2008. Springfield began his recording career in the late 1960s and he had some success in the United States in the 70's with his album Beginnings and the single \"Speak to the Sky\" in 1972. He would continue to record and release new music for the rest of the decade; yet, his musical career would not take off again until 1981 with the release of his first RCA album Working Class Dog. The single \"Jessie's Girl\" from that album would give Springfield his first number one single in the U.S. and he would also win a Grammy Award for that song. Rick's success would continue throughout the 80's with albums such as Success Hasn't Spoiled Me Yet (1982) that contained the singles \"Don't Talk to Strangers\" and \"What Kind of Fool Am I\", and 1983's Living in Oz with the hits \"Affair of the Heart\" and \"Human Touch\". 1984 would see Rick Springfield star in the film Hard to Hold and the accompanying soundtrack album would include the songs \"Love Somebody\" and \"Don't Walk Away\". In the mid-80's, Rick stated that he \"started dealing with serious spiritual issues\" and he began to write more about them in his music. His 1985 release Tao with the singles \"State of the Heart\" and \"Celebrate Youth\" saw Rick moving in a more mature and spiritual direction. His 1988 album Rock of Life would be his last album of the new material in the 1980s. This compilation contains the hit singles Rick Springfield released from 1981 through 1988. That period included some of Rick's most successful years on the charts."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Dignity is the fourth studio album by American recording artist Hilary Duff. It was released on March 21, 2007, by Hollywood Records. After launching her third record Hilary Duff (2004), she experienced an eventful personal life, including a stalking incident, her parents' separation, and breaking up with her boyfriend. Consequently, Duff assumed an integral position in its production, co-writing almost every track with longtime collaborator Kara DioGuardi instead of her previously-limited involvement. Duff was musically inspired by indie rock band The Faint and pop singers Beyonc\u00E9 and Gwen Stefani. In contrast to the pop rock themes of her prior releases, Dignity takes on more of a dance sound, which she said was not her intention while writing the album. The lyrics reference the events Duff experienced in the years leading to the album's release, and the album's songs contain influences of rock and roll and hip hop music. Critical response was mostly positive; the album was praised for its songwriting and her new musical direction. Upon release, Dignity debuted at number three in the US, a lower peak than Duff's previous albums and with lower sales, which Billboard attributed to the loss of fans during her musical evolution. Despite this, it produced Duff's highest-peaking US single to date, \"With Love\" (number 24), and two US number one club hits. The album has reached the top ten in several countries and was certified Gold in the US by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA)."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Dirty is the seventh studio album by American alternative rock band Sonic Youth. It was released on July 21, 1992 by record label DGC. The band recorded and produced the album with Butch Vig in early 1992 at The Magic Shop studios. The sound on Dirty was inspired by the grunge scene of the time, and was described as avant-rock. Some songs on the album mark the first appearance of three guitars in Sonic Youth songs. The album was remastered and released on quadruple vinyl and double CD in 2003. The album spawned four singles. The first single was \"100%\", but it was not the crossover hit the label anticipated. Geffen Record executive Mark Kates admitted the single \"was not a great radio song\", however, the single did chart well. The next was \"Youth Against Fascism\", which did not chart well. The last two were \"Sugar Kane\" and \"Drunken Butterfly\", released in 1993. \"Sugar Kane\" did better commercially than \"Youth Against Fascism\". The album sold exceptionally well, reaching No. 6 in the UK Albums Chart (their highest charting album in the UK) and No. 83 in the US. In support of the album, the band embarked on the \"Pretty Fucking Dirty\" tour of 1992 and 1993, where most of Dirty was played. In late 1992, they toured North America, and in early 1993, they toured New Zealand and Australia and released the Whores Moaning EP, which featured most of the \"Sugar Kane\" B-sides."@en ;

It was recorded, mixed and mastered in London, England, in 1983 and released at the beginning of 1984. The sound engineer chosen for the recording sessions was the expert Julian Mendelsohn, who had previously worked with acts like Yes, Elton John, Jimmy Page and Bob Marley. The original Japanese version was licensed and released by Music for Nations in the UK and Roadrunner Records in Europe. Attention by major US labels for the band and the need to make their work accessible to Western audiences, prompted a new release of the album with vocal tracks sung in English on July 1, 1984. The English version opened the album with the instrumental \"Anthem (Loudness Overture)\" by Akira Takasaki, which was missing in the original Japanese release."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Dog & Butterfly is the fourth studio album by American rock band Heart, released on October 7, 1978 through Portrait Records. Heart rebounded from their legal dispute with Mushroom Records over the release of the platinum-selling Magazine in April 1978, as Dog & Butterfly was certified double platinum, spent 36 weeks on the charts, and peaked at No. 17 on the US Billboard 200. The album was the 'proper' successor to 1977's hit Little Queen in terms of musical development and direction, and contained two hit singles: \"Straight On\", and \"Dog & Butterfly\". As Heart themselves noted on the album's release, side 1 was the \"Dog\" side, and was the more \"rocking\" compared to the \"Butterfly\" side 2, which was all ballads, with the exception of the closer \"Mistral Wind\", which, in many ways, epitomized the trademark sound for which Heart would be remembered: folksy ballads shifting into searing hard rock explosions. Though the first song, \"Cook with Fire\", sounds like a live recording, the liner notes to the 2004 CD say that it was actually recorded at Sea-West Studios along with the rest of the album. Audience sounds from a live performance were overdubbed on the studio recording. The album was reissued in a remastered edition in 2004 by Epic/Legacy and included three bonus tracks from this period. The song \"Feels\" was later reworked and became \"Johnny Moon\", included in the album Passionworks (1983)."@en ;

Dystopia was also the last Iced Earth studio album to feature bassist Freddie Vidales and drummer Brent Smedley until his return in 2015. The album was recorded during the summer of 2011 at Morrisound Recording, with co-producer Jim Morris. While not a concept album, many of the album's songs are inspired by dystopian themes and films, very much like the group's 2001 album Horror Show, which was largely inspired by horror films and other similar subjects. Two songs off of Dystopia (the title track and \"Tragedy and Triumph\") feature the return of rhythm guitarist Jon Schaffer's Something Wicked concept, which has appeared on many of the band's previous albums. During its first week, the album sold over 6,000 copies in the United States and charted in eight countries, including Germany, Finland and the UK. The album was met with a very positive response, with some critics calling it one of Iced Earth's best albums. Many also praised Stu Block's performance and wide vocal range.

Some thought it was because the band wanted to regain their massive success of their previous album The Reason because the album had a couple of successful hits but the most successful hit was the title track which was a ballad song. The second and third singles from Every Man for Himself were \"Inside of You\" and \"Born to Lead\" respectively. Those who pre-ordered the album from Apple's iTunes Music Store, received a bonus track called \"Face the Music.\" Those who purchased the album in Japan received 2 bonus tracks with their green limited edition CDs titled \"Finally Awake\" and \"Waiting\".

The album was produced by Val Garay. It made heavy use of synthesizers and had a decidedly pop sound. The first single, a remake of The Drifters' 1960 hit \"Save the Last Dance for Me\" was a top ten country single for Parton in early 1984 and came close to making the pop Top 40 as well (#45). Dolly Parton's cover of the 1965 Petula Clark hit \"Downtown\" was the album's second single. The title song was originally a hit for The Platters in 1956. In 1986, a remixed version of the track \"We Had It All\" was included on Think About Love, a compilation album of remixes of previously released Parton material; the song was released as a single in late 1986, and provided an additional top-thirty single for Parton. The Great Pretender was the first Dolly Parton album to be issued on the then-new CD format at the time of its release. It was released digitally for the first time on 4 December 2015."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"There Goes Rhymin' Simon is the third solo studio album by American musician Paul Simon rush-released on May 5, 1973. It contains songs covering several styles and genres, such as gospel (\"Loves Me Like a Rock\") and Dixieland (\"Take Me to the Mardi Gras\"). It received two nominations at the Grammy Awards of 1974, including Best Male Pop Vocal performance and Album of the Year. As foreshadowed by the feel-good lead single \"Kodachrome\" (which reached #2 on the Billboard charts, blocked by Billy Preston's \"Will It Go Round in Circles\"), There Goes Rhymin' Simon proved to be a bigger hit than its predecessor, reaching #2 on the Billboard 200 chart (kept off the top spot by George Harrison's Living in the Material World), and #1 on Cashbox Magazine for one week on June 30, 1973. In the United Kingdom, the album peaked at #4. Subsequent singles were also the #2 single \"Loves Me Like a Rock\" (knocked-off by Cher's \"Half-Breed\", but reaching #1 on Cashbox on September 29, 1973), and the Top 40 hit \"American Tune\". Also \"Take Me to the Mardi Gras\" was released in the UK reaching the Top 20. The song \"Kodachrome\" is named after the Kodak film of the same name. Kodak required the album to note that Kodachrome is a trademark of Kodak. The song was not released as a single in Britain, where it could not be played on BBC radio due to its trademarked name. The song \"Was a Sunny Day\" has an interesting reference to early rock and roll in the line \"She called him Speedo but his Christian name was Mr. Earl\" which echoes the chorus from the 1955 song \"Speedo\" by The Cadillacs: \"They often call me Speedo but my real name is Mr. Earl,\" referring to lead singer, Earl \"Speedo\" Carroll."@en ;

Because the liner notes on Butchered at Birth feature quotations from American serial killer Albert Fish, he is often incorrectly credited with being the voice at the beginning of \"Addicted to Vaginal Skin\". However, the taped confession heard at the beginning of the song most likely belongs to the \"Genesee River Killer\" Arthur Shawcross. The song \"Hammer Smashed Face\" was featured during the band's cameo appearance in the film Ace Ventura: Pet Detective, and downloadable content for the Rock Band video game series.

The project has been to develop a viable electric energy power system for automobiles. Young's own 1959 Lincoln Continental will serve as their completed prototype. A documentary produced by Larry Johnson followed the electric car in its first long-distance trip to Washington, DC. In November 2010 the car started a fire which caused over a million dollars of damage to a warehouse and possessions of Young stored there. Young blamed the fire on human error and said he and his team were committed to rebuilding the car. \"The wall charging system was not completely tested and had never been left unattended. A mistake was made. It was not the fault of the car\", he said.

	dbo:abstract	"Two Hands, One Mouth: Live in Europe is an album by American rock/pop group Sparks, released in March 2013. It is their first ever live album, and first double CD album. In October 2012, Ron and Russell Mael performed for the first time ever as a duo, with no band. The 18-city European tour titled \"Two Hands, One Mouth\" began in Lithuania and followed in Latvia, Finland, Norway, Sweden, Germany, Belgium, the UK and Ireland. The final UK concert of the tour was at the sold-out Barbican Centre in London. The tour then took the group to Japan with concerts in Tokyo and Osaka in January 2013. In April 2013, the show was presented for the first time in the US with two performances at the Coachella Festival. A short US tour followed. \"Two Hands, One Mouth: Live In Europe\" was released in March 2013. It contains concert recordings gathered from various cities during the October 2012 European tour: which concert each track came from is only known for one, the final track, thanks to Russell Mael saying \"Thank you all our friends in Manchester\" after the song finishes. It's also very likely that the recording of \"Hospitality on parade\" is from Finland, because Russell introduces the band in Finnish. (\"Moi, yst\u00E4v\u00E4t. Min\u00E4 olen Russell.

So instead, Welch used these songs for his debut solo album. For the most part, French Kiss presents a mix of hard rock guitar, disco-ish rhythms and sweeping strings. The big hits were \"Ebony Eyes\" (with backing vocals by Juice Newton), which peaked at #14 in the US, and a revised version of \"Sentimental Lady\", which peaked at #8, a song that Welch had originally recorded with Fleetwood Mac in 1972, for the album Bare Trees. \"Hot Love, Cold World\" also became a minor hit, which peaked at #31. The album itself peaked at #12 in the US and later went platinum. It is currently Welch's best-selling album."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Vanity 6 is the 1982 self-titled debut studio album by the R&B girl group Vanity 6 released on Warner Bros. Records. The group had been created by Prince as an outlet for his prolific song writing. All three women in the group (Vanity, Brenda Bennett, Susan Moonsie) shared lead and background vocals. As was typical for Prince's side projects, he obscured his virtually complete responsibility for the production, songwriting, and instrumental performances by arbitrarily attributing the credits to other members of his musical stable or the fictional \"The Starr Company\". \"If a Girl Answers (Don't Hang Up)\" was co-written with The Time member Terry Lewis and \"Bite the Beat\" was co-written with Jesse Johnson. \"He's So Dull\" was written by Dez Dickerson and can be heard briefly in the 1983 film National Lampoon's Vacation. The \"other woman\" rap on the song \"If a Girl Answers (Don't Hang Up)\" is performed by Prince in an affected voice whose resemblance to that of The Time's lead singer Morris Day has sometimes led to Day being misidentified as the performer. The album was originally released on August 11, 1982 by Warner Bros. Records on LP and cassette. A compact disc was issued in September 1988. All three formats are now out of print. Vinyl copies of the album were pressed with \"Side 1\" and \"Side 6\" on the label. Reviewing the album in The Village Voice, Robert Christgau wrote, \"All eight of these dumb, dancy little synth tunes get me off when I let my guard down, and most of them are funny, hooky, and raunchy at the same time.\" The album was later certified gold by the RIAA in 1983 a year after its release due in large part to the smash success of Prince's 1999. This would be the only album released by Vanity 6."@en ;

The album, which was released on November 22, 2012, is Keys' first release with RCA Records following Sony Music Entertainment's decision to close J Records during a company reshuffle. Girl on Fire was conceived shortly after Keys' marriage to record producer and rapper Swizz Beatz as well as the birth of her first child, Egypt. It is an R&B album with a mixture of conventional genre songs and piano ballads, some of which touch on Keys' marriage and motherhood. The album sold 159,000 copies in its first week in the United States and became her lowest opening sales for an album. It was a considerable drop from her previous effort, The Element of Freedom (2009), which opened at #2 with sales of 417,000 units. The lead single was the title track; it charted at #2 Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs and #11 on the Billboard Hot 100 and reached the Top 10 in several countries worldwide. The second single, \"Brand New Me\", was only released to US urban adult contemporary radio stations. Upon its release, Girl on Fire received generally positive reviews from music critics. The album has since spawned two further singles: The second international single \"New Day\" and the third US urban adult contemporary single \"Fire We Make\" (featuring Maxwell). At 56th Grammy Awards the album won in the Best R&B Album category."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Guerrilla is the third studio album by Welsh rock band the Super Furry Animals. The record was released on 14 June 1999 by Creation Records and peaked at number 10 in the UK Album Charts. Guerrilla was conceived as a commercial 'pop' album and was produced by the band themselves, as regular producer Gorwel Owen felt exhausted after a busy schedule working for other bands. Recording took place at Real World Studios, Box, Wiltshire in mid-1998 with the group experimenting with a sampler for the first time and writing a number of songs in the studio. The band tried to create a 45-minute long, immediate sounding record, and therefore chose the upbeat songs from the 25 tracks which were recorded during sessions for the album. Guerrilla was chosen as the album's title as a pun on the group's name. The album features a mix of musical styles and was described as exemplifying the 'nu-psychedelia' musical genre by British music magazine the NME. Singer Gruff Rhys has stated that his lyrics are upbeat and disposable. Critical reception was generally positive with the record appearing in the \"Best album of 1999\" lists issued by several magazines. The band were disappointed with the relative lack of success of the album's singles and went on \"pop strike\" as a result, issuing the 'lo-fi', all-Welsh language Mwng as the follow-up to Guerrilla in May 2000."@en ;

Inspired by the band's experiences on the Zoo TV Tour, Zooropa expanded on many of the tour's themes of technology and media oversaturation. The record continued the group's experimentation with alternative rock, electronic dance music, and electronic sound effects that began with their previous album, Achtung Baby, in 1991. U2 began writing and recording for Zooropa in Dublin in February 1993, during a six-month break between legs of the Zoo TV Tour. The record was originally intended as an EP to promote the \"Zooropa\" leg of the tour that was to begin in May 1993, but during the sessions, the group decided to extend the record to a full-length LP. Pressed for time, U2 wrote and recorded at a rapid pace, with songs originating from many sources. The album was not completed in time for the tour's resumption, forcing the band to travel between Dublin and their tour destinations in May to complete mixing and recording. Zooropa received generally favourable reviews from critics. Despite none of its three singles\u2014\"Numb\", \"Lemon\", and \"Stay (Faraway, So Close!)\"\u2014being hits consistently across regions, the record sold well upon release and peaked at number one in multiple countries. The album's charting duration and lifetime sales of 7 million copies, however, were weaker than Achtung Baby. In 1994, Zooropa won the Grammy Award for Best Alternative Music Album. Although the record was a success and music journalists view the album as one of the group's most creative works, the band regard it with mixed feelings."@en ;

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/H_(EP)>	rdf:type	schema:MusicAlbum ;
	dbo:abstract	"H is an EP by Japanese recording artist Ayumi Hamasaki, featuring songs later included on her fifth studio album Rainbow (2002). The EP contains the songs \"Independent\", \"July 1st\" and \"Hanabi\", all written and co-composed by Hamasaki (under the alias Crea), alongside composer Dai Nagao and producer Max Matsuura. Hamasaki had written and recorded the three songs when she was still hurt and influenced by the events of the September 11 attacks and the completion of her fourth studio album I Am... (2002). The attacks influenced Hamasaki's lyrical and musical direction, and had made her decide to create more worldly-inspired music. The EP utilizes dance and pop music, with each song being influenced by pop rock, electronica, and trip hop music. Like Rainbow, it contains ambient-influenced sounds such as handclaps and cheering. The lyrical content deals with freedom, fun and sadness, continuing themes seen on her previous album. The EP received mostly positive reviews from music critics, who commended the production value. Many critics praised it as being one of Hamasaki's career highlights. The EP was commercially successful in her native Japan, peaking at number one on the weekly Oricon Singles Chart. It became the only single in 2002 the same year to sell over one million units in Japan, and was certified by the Recording Industry Association of Japan for one million copies shipped to stores. No music videos were created to promote the EP, which makes only one of three single or extended play releases by Hamasaki to lack videos (including A (1999), \"Unite!\" (2001) and \"Terminal\" (2014). However, the singles did have commercial endorsed videos by product companies that featured Hamasaki. The songs have been performed several times on her domestic and nationwide tours including A-nation and her stadium tours Ayumi Hamasaki Stadium Tour 2002 A and Ayumi Hamasaki Countdown Live 2002\u20132003 A."@en ;

These themes include two themes for Voldemort, two themes for Hogwarts, a Diagon Alley theme, a Quidditch theme, a flying theme, a friendship theme, and the main theme (\"Hedwig's Theme\"). This main theme can be found in all of the films although not usually in its unaltered state. The soundtrack was certified gold in Canada (50,000 units) by the Canadian Recording Industry Association on 14 December 2001. It was also certified gold in Japan for 100,000 units by the RIAJ. In 2002, the soundtrack was nominated for Best Original Score at the 74th Academy Awards in which Williams took part in conducting the ceremony. However, Williams lost to Howard Shore's score of The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring. The soundtrack was performed at Air Lyndhurst Studios and Abbey Road Studios in London.

Shanks produced the album, and Simpson co-wrote all the songs with Shanks and DioGuardi. On December 15, I Am Me was certified Platinum by the RIAA for its shipments of over one million copies in the U.S. (as of April 2008, it had sold 987,000 copies). A new single from Simpson, \"Invisible\", was reportedly going to be included on a re-release of I Am Me in mid-2006, but was canceled.

Though the sonic palette features classical guitar and vocal melody, as in his debut Veneer, it is occasionally expanded. Hand claps, backing vocals and synthesizer are some notable additions. In Sweden, the first single was \"Killing for Love\", whereas in the rest of Europe it was \"Down the Line\". Both singles came with the same B-side, a cover of \"Smalltown Boy\" by Bronski Beat. The second single released was \"Teardrop\" (backed with the exclusive instrumental B-side \"Four Forks Ache\"), and the third single was another split--\"Killing for Love\" in the UK, and \"Down the Line\" in Sweden.

	dbo:abstract	"Land of the Free is the fourth studio album by German power metal band Gamma Ray, released in 1995. Continuing a trend that would conclude with the band's fifth studio release, the lineup for the album was different from the previous one, as Land of the Free was the first Gamma Ray album to be released since the departure of Ralf Scheepers, leaving Kai Hansen to take up lead vocals. While not his first stint as a vocalist (Hansen had sung lead for Helloween until 1987 and had also recorded lead vocals on \"Heal Me\" from Insanity and Genius), it would be the first time he had performed lead vocals exclusively in 8 years. Additionally, bassist Jan Rubach was to swap positions with guitarist Dirk Schl\u00E4chter. Rubach initially agreed, but then resisted making the move. Rubach and drummer Thomas Nack instead decided to leave Gamma Ray. Rubach left towards the tail end of Men on a Tour; Schl\u00E4chter took over the bass duties and Henjo Richter took over as the second guitarist. Nack would complete the tour and then leave, with both Rubach and Nack rejoining their former band Anesthesia. Michael Kiske (ex-Helloween) and Hansi K\u00FCrsch (Blind Guardian) were featured on the album as guest vocalists. The track \"Afterlife\" was written as a tribute to Ingo Schwichtenberg, Kai Hansen's former bandmate in Helloween, who committed suicide prior to the album's release. Along with most of the band's past catalogue, the album was re-released in 2003 with a different cover and expanded tracklist which featured three tracks that had either appeared as bonuses on various editions of the album (namely \"Heavy Metal Mania\", which was a Japanese bonus track on the original release) or were unreleased tracks."@en ;

Following on from their previous release Spirit of Eden (1988), and the departure of bassist Paul Webb, which reduced the band to the duo of Mark Hollis and Lee Harris, Talk Talk acrimoniously left EMI and signed to the jazz-based Verve Records, and recorded Laughing Stock at Wessex Sound Studios, London, with producer Tim Friese-Greene and engineer Phill Brown from September 1990\u2013April 1991. Like its predecessor, Spirit of Eden, the album featured improvised instrumentation from a large ensemble of musicians, including as many as seven violists on occasion, and the lyrical themes are often religious. The recording sessions have attained near-mythical status among underground music fans;[citation needed] Tape Op magazine ran an extensive article detailing the demanding recording sessions, marked by Mark Hollis' perfectionist tendencies, and his use of candles and incense to set the mood. Engineer Phill Brown stated that the album, like its predecessor, was \"recorded by chance, accident, and hours of trying every possible overdub idea.\" However, compared to prior Talk Talk albums, he goes on to note that \"Laughing Stock is a different beast. I am very proud of the album, it's probably one of my best projects.... but I find it dark and claustrophobic.\" The album was released in September 1991. Although not a commercial success, and initially receiving some mixed reviews, the album has gone on to receieve retrospective acclaim, and is seen as a forerunner to the post-rock genre and has influenced numerous indie, folk and experimental artists. Several critics have ranked the album among the greatest of the 1990s and of all time. The band split up following its release, effectively making Laughing Stock their last official release."@en ;

Iha took on a more acoustic country-ish sound reminiscent of the songs he contributed to the Pumpkins, notably shying away from the darker sound of Billy Corgan's songwriting. Iha had said that the quieter tone of the songs reflected the fact that many of them were written in his hotel rooms during The Smashing Pumpkins tours, and he didn't want to disturb other guests by playing too loudly. Be Strong Now was released as a 4-track single, featuring the bonus studio tracks \"Falling\", \"My Advice\" and \"Take Care\", and as a 2-track promo single where the other track is a 12-second clip from the song \"Be Strong Now\" called \"Call Out Hook\". Both versions of the \"Be Strong Now\" single feature the same cover. There is also an extended promo version of the single called \"Be Strong Now (With Intro)\" lasting 3:35.

The album outsold many major national releases in the Pittsburgh area and generated huge local radio hits. The release was the band's first on Razor & Tie, the New York-based minor rock label. Let It Go has been critically acclaimed, despite being unknown to rock fans in most parts of the country. However, the success of the album's singles in the Pittsburgh market led to their spread to audiences in nearby Cleveland and Central Pennsylvania. \"Better Off Without You,\" with its irresistible vocals was one of the region's biggest hits in 2000. Falling not far behind in terms of popularity was \"Born Too Late,\" a powerful retrospective song. Most fans and critics believe that either of these songs could have been international hits if they were released by a major record company. \"Snowman,\" with its purposely vague lyrics and solid hook, and the title track \"Let It Go,\" which resembles a fast-paced 1960s rock song, were the other two singles. \"Chasin' Girls\" also saw some significant radio airplay. \"Let It Go\" actually made several national appearances, although it did not bolster the song's national popularity. It appeared in the 2001 Warner Bros. film Summer Catch. It was also played during the closing credits of each episode of The Anna Nicole Show on the E! Network. The track \"Born Too Late\" originally appeared on frontman Scott Blasey's 1999 solo album, Shine, but was then reworked by the entire band for its appearance on this album."@en ;

The first single released from the album was \"Changes\", which was released on September 15, 2008 in the UK, and peaked at number 10 on the UK Singles Chart. The second single lifted was \"Grace\", and despite heavy airplay on music stations and TV music channels, the single only managed to peak at number 33, Will's lowest peak position for a single at the time. \"Let It Go\" was the third single lifted from the album, released on 2 March 2009 only in the UK, and failed to impact the UK Top 40, peaking at number 58, surpassing \"Grace\" as his lowest-charting single ever. The fourth and final single released was \"Tell Me The Worst\", and it served as a club promotional single."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Life Is Good is the eleventh studio album by American rapper Nas. It was recorded at various studios in New York and California, and produced primarily by No I.D. and Salaam Remi. Nas wrote the album after his divorce from recording artist Kelis and compared it to Marvin Gaye's 1978 record Here, My Dear. He wanted to vent personal feelings and address moments in his life in his songs, while drawing on 1980s hip hop influences for the album's production in order to complement its nostalgic tone. Life Is Good features personal subject matter, themes of adulthood and nostalgia, and reflections on Nas' personal life and experience in hip hop. His rapping is characterized by a relaxed, plainspoken flow, internal rhymes, and a tone that veers from malicious to nostalgic and introspective. The album's production incorporates orchestral elements and musical references to both contemporary and golden age hip hop, including boom bap beats and old school samples. When Life Is Good was released on July 13, 2012, by Def Jam Recordings, it received widespread critical acclaim and debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 in the United States. It also reached the top 10 of record charts in Canada, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom. It was promoted with three singles\u2014\"Nasty\", \"The Don\", and \"Daughters\"\u2014five music videos, and Nas' touring during June to December 2012.

A concept album, it is a satirical appraisal of the music industry, including song publishers, unions, the press, accountants, business managers, and life on the road. Musically Lola Versus Powerman is varied, described by Stephen Thomas Erlewine as \"a wildly unfocused but nonetheless dazzling tour de force\", containing some of Ray Davies' strongest songs. Although it appeared during a transitional period for the Kinks, Lola Versus Powerman was a success both critically and commercially for the group, charting in the Top 40 in America and helping restore them in the public eye, making it a \"comeback\" album. It contained two hit singles: \"Lola\", which reached the top 10 in the US and UK, and \"Apeman\", which peaked at number five in the UK."@en ;

After the release and promotion of their previous album, Bilingual, Pet Shop Boys started work with playwright Jonathan Harvey on the stage musical that eventually became Closer to Heaven (at one stage during the writing process, the musical was given the name of Nightlife). Pet Shop Boys soon had an album's worth of tracks and decided to release the album Nightlife as a concept album and in order to showcase some of the songs that would eventually make it into the musical. The album incorporates a variety of musical influences, including hard trance on the Rollo-produced \"For Your Own Good\" and \"Radiophonic\"; dance-pop on \"Closer to Heaven\" and \"I Don't Know What You Want But I Can't Give It Any More\"; disco pastiche on \"New York City Boy\"; and country music on \"You Only Tell Me You Love Me When You're Drunk\".

Norfolk Coast peaked at No. 70 in the UK Albums Chart in February, for one week's duration in that listing. The album was well received by reviewers and fans alike, showing a return to form of the band. It also spawned the band's UK first Top 40 hit single for more than a decade, \"Big Thing Coming\" (No. 31 in February 2004 in the UK Singles Chart). The album saw the re-emergence of some of their signature sounds, such as Dave Greenfield's swirling keyboards, in a contemporary setting. The hard-edged title track sets the direction for much of the album, while there are more contemplative moments, such as the atmospheric \"Tuckers Grave\", dedicated to Edwin Tucker, who committed suicide in 1747 (and was written in the room in which he died). This was also the last album to feature Paul Roberts on lead vocals. Norfolk Coast was also the name of a short film starring Jean Jacques Burnel.

	dbo:abstract	"Oingo Boingo is the first official release from the southern California new wave band Oingo Boingo. The song selection includes three original compositions by Danny Elfman, as well as a ska inflected cover of bluesman Willie Dixon's \"Violent Love\". The EP was issued on cassette tape, 10\", and 12\" vinyl formats with a slight difference in the track listing: the 10\" version contained the 1979 version of \"Ain't This the Life\" from their Demo EP, while the 12\" version and cassette contained a new recording. Both \"Only a Lad\" and \"I'm So Bad\" had also been previously issued on the Demo EP and the versions are identical on all of the formats. Whilst the EP has never been released on CD in its entirety, the 10\" format was made available digitally via such services as iTunes Store and Amazon. However, the songs can only be bought as separate tracks rather than as an album. The song \"Only a Lad\" was subsequently re-recorded and issued as the title track on their first long playing album, Only a Lad. The cover includes an illustration of a cat by artist Louis Wain from the later stages of his schizophrenia."@en ;

Puzzle was released almost two years after the release of their second album, KJ2 Zukkoke Dai Dass\u014D. There were two versions of this release, a regular edition and a CD+DVD limited edition. First press of the regular edition came with a photobook containing pictures from the making of the unit promotional videos, the normal edition came with member solos, and the limited edition CD+DVD came with a DVD documenting the making of the album, creation of the units, and music videos for each unit. The music's style is, again, unlike its predecessor. Out of all the albums released by the group, \"Puzzle\" is considerably the most \"modern\" sounding album of the bunch compared to KJ1 F.T.O which was primarily an 80s era pop sound and to KJ2 Zukkoke Dai Dassou's 70s era pop sound. The album is well diverse, with a blended balance of R&B, pop, rock, and slow ballads that present the group in a more mature, \"boyband\", sounding nature than their more notorious \"comedy\" sound. Jouya Uenaka of The Inazuma Sentai returned to write for the album, producing the group's biggest to date, \"Musekinin Hero\", as well as writing every rock song on the album. Kanjani Eight had a more creative control over the album, selecting from around 60 demos to sing for the album. Nishikido had personally requested Kazuyoshi Saito to write the title track of the album for the group. The member solos were all written and/or composed by the group themselves as well as for the special units for the album. The units themselves were picked out through a game of Jan Ken Pon during the night of their NTV Best Hit Artist 2008 performance."@en ;

Singer Gruff Rhys has described Radiator as \"more interesting\" than the band's debut Fuzzy Logic with the group taking advantage of producer Gorwel Owen's \"Atari computers, and banks of old vintage synths\" to create an album which was \"musically ... much more adventurous\". The track 'Download' repeatedly appeared on the hit Welsh TV Show 'Lois' about a young teenage girl struggling to come to terms with her anorexia."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Shakira is the tenth studio album by Colombian singer Shakira, released on 21 March 2014 by RCA Records. It is her first English-language album since her eighth studio album, She Wolf (2009). Shakira revealed in November 2011 that she had begun work on the album, which continued into 2014. The album was initially set to be released in 2012, but was delayed because of Shakira's pregnancy. Since starting the album, Shakira departed Epic Records, signed a new management deal with Roc Nation and subsequently signed to Epic's sister label, RCA Records. A pop album, Shakira has a diverse musical style that incorporates a range of genres such as reggae and rock, as well as dance and country elements. Its production is characterized by lean, tender verses and muscular, ecstatic choruses, that incorporate swirling, crashing sounds. The album's lyrics explore motherhood, the complexities of romantic relationships, stages of love and the search for personal happiness. Most of the album was written by Shakira, along with Nasri and Adam Messinger, with all the previous predominantly producing the album. Upon release Shakira was met with positive reviews from music critics, praising its lyrical content, while others stated that Shakira was trying to \"Americanize her sound\". Commercially the album debuted at number two on the US Billboard 200 chart with first week sales of 85,000 copies. By doing so, Shakira became the singer's highest-charting album on the chart, although it also achieved her lowest first-week sales figure (for an English-language album). The album campaign started in 2014, with the release of its first single, \"Can't Remember to Forget You\", followed by the singles \"Empire\" and \"Dare (La La La)\"."@en ;

The record company barely promoted it in order to test different markets, a pattern that would continue all throughout the rest of the 1990s and 2000s. While Cinderella's first three albums all went platinum, the domination of grunge and alternative rock in the mid-1990s was so strong that it forced Still Climbing to chart at a lowly #178 and drop out after a mere few weeks, despite featuring the minor hits \"Bad Attitude Shuffle\" (which was released as a single), \"Hard to Find the Words\", and \"Hot & Bothered\" from Wayne's World. On a side note, the track \"Talk Is Cheap\" first appeared during a Cinderella show in 1987, though the version on this album is longer than the original, being slower in vocals."@en ;

It was critically acclaimed and commercially successful, becoming Webb's first solo album to break into the Billboard Top 200 albums chart. The album generated controversy for its use of profanity (particularly the use of the word \"shit,\" in the context of a harsh spiritual object lesson in the song \"What Matters More\") and references to alcohol and sexuality, to the degree that it was originally refused by his record label. After an elaborate online scavenger hunt Webb staged for his fans to \"unlock\" the song for free distribution, his label conceded to releasing a \"clean version\" and an \"explicit version\" of the album, the latter of which was only available directly from Webb at his shows, or by ordering online."@en ;

However, it was at these recording sessions where Sting and Copeland were first introduced to guitarist Andy Summers, who later replaced Padovani as the Police's guitarist, thus cementing the group's classic lineup.

	dbo:abstract	"The Cost of Living is an EP by the English punk rock band The Clash. It was released on 11 May 1979 in a gatefold sleeve. The EP was produced by the band and Bill Price, it marked a transition in musical styles for the band, bridging the intensity of their earlier, punky albums with the broader, more American influenced rock and roll yet to come on London Calling, most evident on the folk rocking \"Groovy Times\" and \"Gates of the West\". The Clash's cover of Sonny Curtis' \"I Fought the Law\" became one of the definitive recordings of the song, and remained in the band's live set list for much of the rest of their career. Joe Strummer also performed it with his later bands, including during his stint with The Pogues. The early single \"Capital Radio\" was re-recorded because the band learned that copies of the original Capital Radio EP were selling for high prices. \"Capital Radio\", later listed as \"Capital Radio Two\", is much longer, mainly because of a protracted outro. Gates of the West clearly describes the ecstasy of The Clash in their first encounter with the United States - \"Eastside Jimmy & Southside Sue both said they needed something new\". \"From Camden Town Station to 44th & 8th\" describes their journey from their London neighborhood to the middle of Manhattan. It was recorded in Highbury, London, and features \"extra high vocal\" credited to Dennis Ferranti and harmonica credited to Bob Jones (in reality Mick Jones)."@en ;

The album reached #3 in the UK; overseas, it hit #4 in Canada on the RPM national Top Albums Chart and #18 in the US on the Billboard 200 in 1983. It went on to be certified platinum in the UK and Canada. It contains the song \"In a Big Country\" which is their only U.S. Top 40 hit single. The song featured heavily engineered guitar playing, strongly reminiscent of bagpipes; Adamson and fellow guitarist Watson achieved this through the use of the MXR Pitch Transposer 129 Guitar Effect. Also contributing to the band's unique sound was their use of the e-bow, a device which allows a guitar to sound more like strings or synthesizer. The album has been remastered and reissued on three occasions. The latest version released by Universal in 2012 in advance of the album's 30th anniversary includes a second disc of previously unissued demos. Also included in the set is a track produced by Chris Thomas from the first abortive attempt to record the band's debut album. The demos include the earliest recordings done by Adamson and Bruce Watson, some of which were recorded on four-track prior to recruiting either a drummer or bassist for the band. The set also includes a booklet with interviews (new in the case of the current band members and archived in the case of the late Stuart Adamson) by the journalist and author Tim Barr. Lyrics for all of the key songs are also included, and the album has been remastered by Paschal Byrne from the original master tapes.

	dbo:abstract	"The Definitive Collection is a 2001 greatest hits compilation album of all the singles released by Swedish pop group ABBA. It consisted of two discs: the first featuring the singles from 1972\u201379 (\"People Need Love\" to \"Does Your Mother Know\"), and the second including the singles from 1979\u201382 (\"Voulez-Vous\" to \"Under Attack\"), with the tracks being listed in chronological order. The main exception is the track \"Thank You for the Music\", which, despite being written and recorded in 1977, was in fact released as a single (primarily in the UK) in 1983 after the band had split up. It appears on disc two, along with two bonus tracks, \"Ring Ring\" (1974 UK single remix), and \"Voulez-Vous\" (1979 US promo extended remix). The Australian version of The Definitive Collection adds a further two bonus tracks: \"Rock Me\" and \"Hasta Ma\u00F1ana\". The 1974 remix of \"Ring Ring\" is the first appearance on CD of this version mastered from the original master tape, after the UK single master tapes had been returned to Polar Music by the former UK licensees, Epic Records. The track's previous appearance on CD, in a 1999 singles boxed set, was mastered from a vinyl single. The Definitive Collection is the only ABBA compilation to include all the UK single releases from 1973 to 1983. The four \"unofficial\" UK ABBA singles are included, these being the 1974 remix of \"Ring Ring\", \"Angeleyes\", \"Lay All Your Love on Me\" and \"Thank You for the Music\". An \"unofficial single\" is one that was not released by ABBA's record label, Polar Music, in any Scandinavian country. The Definitive Collection replaced an old collection of ABBA's singles titled The Singles: The First Ten Years, released in 1982. A DVD also called The Definitive Collection was released in 2002, and features all of ABBA's videos, as well as five bonus videos and a picture gallery. In the US the 2-CD set was bundled with the DVD. In 2003, the album was ranked number 179 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time. The album was re-released in 2012 as The Essential Collection with different artwork. This version removed both bonus tracks but added four tracks for which there were promotional videos: \"Bang-A-Boomerang\", \"That's Me\", \"One Man, One Woman\" and \"Happy New Year\". These tracks were included chronologically, and additionally \"Thank You for the Music\" was moved from the end of the album to its chronological place after \"Eagle\". The collection was released as a two-CD set, a DVD, and a three-disc set including the DVD and both CDs."@en ;

Described by Triosphere as \"the most intense and the most fragile music the band as ever done\", it took four years to be completed from the creative process to its final form, with a recording lasting almost an entire year. Following their usual songwriting method, all songs were composed by guitarist Marius Silver Bergensenn except for the melodies composed by vocalist and bassist Ida Haukland, who also wrote all the lyrics. The album received widespread acclaim from critics, with much praise being given to its energy, composition, and Ida Haukland's vocals and lyrics.

Among the tracks added are a version of Louis Jordan's \"Caldonia\" featuring Muddy Waters and Pinetop Perkins trading off the vocal, a radically reworked version of the live favorite \"Rag Mama Rag\", Neil Young and Joni Mitchell joining the Band on \"Acadian Driftwood\", a blistering take on the Stage Fright classic \"W. S. Walcott Medicine Show\", excerpts from a pair of instrumental jams involving several of the concert's guest performers, and the concert closer \"Don't Do It\". In addition, several edits made on the original 1978 set have been done away with; certain songs (such as \"Forever Young\" with Bob Dylan) are now presented in their unedited versions. Songs still missing from the concert are a version of \"Georgia on My Mind\", the full versions of the two jams presented, the full version of \"Chest Fever\", and the concert takes of \"King Harvest (Has Surely Come)\" and \"Evangeline\". While the album still has overdubbing, re-sequencing, and editing, it does give a more accurate representation of the event itself than the earlier album or film do, according to collectors who have made comparisons with bootleg recordings of the concert."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"The Tain is an EP by The Decemberists released in 2004 by Acuarela Discos and in 2005 by Kill Rock Stars. The single 18-plus minute track, in five parts, is named after the Irish mythological epic T\u00E1in B\u00F3 C\u00FAailnge, often simply called The T\u00E1in. With production help from Chris Walla of Death Cab for Cutie, the Decemberists recorded the EP over the course of four days in Walla's studio in Seattle, Washington. The album cover was designed by the Portland artist Carson Ellis, who is Colin Meloy's wife and has created artwork for each of the group's albums. The lyrics to the Decemberists' song do not directly reference the characters or plot of the Irish epic. Part III contains the only explicit reference in the lyric, \"the mirror's soft silver tain reflects our last and birthing hour\". It is possible that the song was not originally intended to have any connection to the epic itself. The accompanying video by Andy Smetanka does tell the traditional Tain story with silhouettes interspersed by minimal captions, in the manner of a silent movie, but the action in the video proceeds completely independent of the music. As well, a music video for the track was made entirely from silhouette crepe paper stop motion animation, and is available on The Decemberists: A Practical Handbook DVD and the Pitchfork Media music website."@en ;

According to Spin magazine, the album is a landmark moment for The Roots and the collective, as it \"swelled the Roots clique into a movement-style posse\". The album has been considered by music writers as The Roots's breakthrough album, earning praise from major publications and critics, while becoming the group's first record to sell over 500,000 copies. It includes the song \"You Got Me\", which won the 2000 Grammy Award for Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group, while Things Fall Apart was also nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Rap Album of the same year, losing to Eminem for his The Slim Shady LP. Rolling Stone called it a \"top-flight record\", while AllMusic cited it as \"one of the cornerstone albums of alternative rap.\" The album takes its title from Chinua Achebe's novel of the same name, which in turn took the phrase from William Butler Yeats's poem \"The Second Coming\".

	dbo:abstract	"This Side of Paradise is the second solo studio album released by Ric Ocasek, lead singer and songwriter of The Cars. It was released in 1986 by Geffen Records. Though it was a solo album, other members of The Cars played significant roles. Greg Hawkes plays keyboards and bass throughout the album (he appears on most of Ocasek's solo albums), and also co-wrote \"Hello Darkness\" (most Cars albums feature one Ocasek/Hawkes tune). Benjamin Orr is on backing vocals for three songs. Along with Hawkes and Orr, the track \"True To You\" also features Elliot Easton on guitar. Had drummer David Robinson been present, the song would have been an unofficial Cars reunion. Both production and drumming were by Chris Hughes (formerly known as \"Merrick\", drummer for Adam and the Ants). Hughes was the recent producer of Tears for Fears most popular two albums. Steve Stevens from Billy Idol's band plays guitar on over half the songs. In addition, Roland Orzabal from Tears for Fears (guitar on \"Emotion in Motion\"), Tony Levin from King Crimson/Peter Gabriel, Tom Verlaine of Television and G. E. Smith of the Saturday Night Live Band guest on the various songs. The first single from the album, \"Emotion in Motion\", which was aided in its promotion by a popular video that received heavy airplay on MTV, reached #1 on the Mainstream Rock Tracks for one week, becoming Ocasek's only solo chart-topper (as a member of The Cars, he topped the chart with the singles \"You Might Think\" and \"Magic\" in 1984, and \"Tonight She Comes\" in 1985). Ocasek remains the only member of The Cars to have a #1 hit single."@en ;

Rapper Willie D had left the group in 1992 temporarily to pursue a solo career. In his position, fellow Rap-A-Lot member Big Mike joined Scarface and Bushwick Bill for this album. Till Death Do Us Part became the group's first #1 on the R&B/hip hop charts, and also included the group's second top 40 Billboard Hot 100 single, \"Six Feet Deep\" (which used a sample from The Commodores' 1977 hit single \"Easy\"). Other singles released from the album were \"Crooked Officer\" and \"Straight Gangstaism\". Till Death Do Us Part was produced by the Rap-A-Lot in-house producer N.O. Joe. It featured guitar, bass guitar and keyboards by Mike Dean, bass guitar by Roger Tausz, bass guitar and percussion by Preston Middleton, and scratches by DJ Domination. The album was certified gold by the RIAA on May 10, 1993. There is a Chopped & Screwed version by OG Ron C available. There were four music videos releases for the songs in Till Death Do Us Part, for \"Six Feet Deep\", \"Crooked Officer\", \"Straight Gangstaism\" and \"Street Life\". The music video for \"Street Life\" was originally released for the song as an individual single for the soundtrack of the movie South Central and was also added to the album. The album version for \"Straight Gangstaism\" has two verses by Big Mike and one by his group-mate from Convicts, Mr. 3-2, and it was released as a single to boost Big Mike's popularity as a member of the Geto Boys. To avoid confusion among fans and to improve promotion, the video version (and the radio edit) added a fourth verse by Scarface to the end of the song."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Tourist was the second album by English rock band Athlete, released in January 2005 (see 2005 in British music). For this album, Athlete demonstrate a more mature musical style, creating a more stripped-down, sombre and reflective album than their first album Vehicles & Animals. The first single from the album, \"Wires\", became the biggest hit so far for the band when it entered the UK Singles Chart at #4. The album also fared well in the charts, reaching the top of the UK Albums Chart the week it was released, selling 89,000 copies. Despite this success, Tourist had a mixed critical reception, with some suggesting that Athlete had failed to sustain the unique style of their previous album, while others saw the new album as a logical progression from their old sound. Despite the mainstream breakthrough the band achieved with this album, their fanbase was reduced to a mere cult when follow-up Beyond the Neighbourhood became their smallest-seller. At the end of 2005, Tourist became the 32nd best-selling album of the year in the UK, and \"Wires\" was the 89th best-selling single.

	dbo:abstract	"Turn Around is the fifth studio album by American blues guitarist Jonny Lang, released on September 19, 2006 (see 2006 in music). On February 11, 2007, it won the Grammy Award for Best Rock or Rap Gospel Album. From Amazon.com: \"With this album I want to focus, more than ever before, on my purpose in life,\" he explains. \"I've been so incredibly blessed. My wife and I just had our fifth anniversary. I get to do what I love for a living. But it wasn't so long ago that I was spiraling downward in a lot of ways, until God touched my life and set me on the right track. I feel a huge debt to give glory back to Him for everything He has done for me. It's the least I can do.\" That said, Turn Around is not slotted only to listeners who have - or have not - undergone this kind of transformation. It inspires, excites, and gets people on their feet - but it doesn't preach. \"I understand that not everybody believes as I do,\" Lang says, \"which is fine. I just want to sing about what's going on in my life and let people make up their own minds about that.\" For all the conviction that Lang brings to Turn Around, the album began almost as an afterthought. Lang was in the studio one day with his producer, Ron Fair, who is also president of A&M/Interscope Records. There wasn't anything pressing on the agenda; they were doing routine work on the final stages of Lang's previous record, Long Time Coming. Then, out of the blue, Fair said something completely unexpected. \"He looks at me and goes, `Dude, you need to make a gospel record,'\" Lang says, laughing at the recollection. \"Now, I hadn't really mentioned much to Ron about that side of my life, but for some reason he knew where I was at. So I thought about it for just a second and said, `Yes, I do.'\""@en ;

This album was produced by Alan Tarney who had previously worked with Richard on the hits including \"We Don't Talk Anymore\", \"Dreamin\", \"Wired for Sound\" and \"Some People\". The two had not worked together since the 1989 album Stronger. The album reached #11 in the UK Albums Chart and stayed in the charts for 11 weeks. The album is primarily made up of cover songs, including songs by artists such as Elvis Presley, The Beatles, Carole King and Tina Turner. At the time of release the official website for the album explained that it consisted of \"hits Cliff's always Wanted to record.\" The inspiration for the album came when Richard was sent a copy of Israel Kamakawiwo'ole's recording of \"Over the Rainbow\" combined with \"What a Wonderful World\" weeks into the year 2000. He knew immediately he wanted to record it. Two singles were released from this album, the first being the song \"Somewhere Over the Rainbow/What a Wonderful World\" which reached #11 in the UK Singles Chart and stayed for 6 weeks. The second single release was one of the three original songs on the album, \"Let Me Be the One\", which came in at #29. The two other original songs were, \"Do You Wonder\" and \"This Love You Will Never Forget\". The album has sold over 220,000 copies worldwide."@en ;

The group began a lengthy legal battle with Nervous Records in 1995 over the licensing of their name, which finally settled soon before the release of War Zone. Though many of the albums released from the Boot Camp Clik family between 1997 and 1999 received mediocre reviews, War Zone garnered some strong acclaim and moderate sales. The album features the singles \"Two Turntables & a Mic\", \"War Zone\" and \"This Is What It Sounds Like [Worldwind]\". MC 5ft, who only appeared on three tracks on its debut Enta Da Stage, makes the most appearances of his career here, dropping verses on six songs. Da Beatminerz production crew crafts a different sound for War Zone then that heard on Enta Da Stage, lacing the tracks with a futuristic, lo-fi sound. Although War Zone has its share of gritty and hardcore tracks (similarly found on Enta Da Stage), the majority of War Zone consists of songs talking about social and economic problems, as Buckshot displays a maturity unseen on Enta Da Stage."@en ;

Chic worked with Sister Sledge, who had signed to Atlantic in 1973, at the inspiration of Atlantic president Jerry Greenberg. Nile Rodgers remembered later; \" That's why we came up with We Are Family. [-] Everything he said about them gave us a picture of them. You've got to remember, we never even met them.

Nile Rodgers has written that of the various albums produced by The Chic Organization for themselves and others, \"pound for pound, I think We Are Family is our best album hands down.\" The lead vocals to We Are Family were recorded in a single take by the then 18-year-old Kathy Sledge. \"He's the Greatest Dancer\" was the first single from the album and became the group's first major hit, reaching the pop top ten and number one on the R&B chart.

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Wiggle_(album)>	rdf:type	schema:MusicAlbum ;
	dbo:abstract	"Wiggle is the fifth studio album by the American punk rock band Screeching Weasel. It was released on January 15, 1993 through Lookout! Records. Their previous album, My Brain Hurts, had seen a sharp rise in the band's popularity and a shift in sound towards mid-tempo pop songs. With Wiggle, the band shifted gears yet again. Though several tracks retained the catchy, pop-punk sound, many others saw the band venturing into experiments with new wave and some of the harder-edged sounds of the early albums. Another major change was the amount of collaboration in songwriting. Rather than Ben Weasel being the sole author of the majority of the songs, Wiggle features a few credited to the entire band, one by guitarist Danny Vapid, and a couple with bassist (for only this album) Johnny Personality. In addition to this, there are three songs co-written by Joe King of The Queers, which were also recorded by his band. The album received mixed reviews. Many expected a continuation of the previous album and were surprised by the experimentation and harder-edged production. Since its initial release, many of the songs have come to be regarded as the band's best. Others have not held up so well over time. The band has voiced some regrets about the recording of the album, which allowed each member a voice in the mixing of specific songs and resulted in a less cohesive sound. There have also been regrets about the songs chosen for the album in recent years. The bonus tracks of the original Lookout! CD release are \"Teenage Slumber Party\", \"Danny Is a Wimp\", and \"Going Home\". The lyrics to \"Going Home\" were written by Aaron Cometbus of Crimpshrine, and the music by Weasel. After a short time of being out of print, the album was remastered by producer Mass Giorgini and re-released with an additional bonus track \"Fuck the World\" (another song co-written by Joe King of The Queers) on Asian Man Records in 2005. The band had recorded another version of this song entitled \"Amy Saw Me Looking at Her Boobs\" which was released on the compilation album Thank You Very Little. The Queers released their version of the song on their album Love Songs for the Retarded."@en ;

Recording sessions for the album took place primarily at StadiumRed in New York in April 2011. The band members took control of all of the production duties alongside the album's recording engineers, Andrew Everding and Joseph Pedulla. Wildlife was their last release on No Sleep Records before forming their own record label, Better Living. Noted by music writers for its varied elements, Wildlife incorporates musical components from La Dispute's previous releases, particularly Somewhere at the Bottom of the River Between Vega and Altair and Here, Hear III., and genres such as screamo, progressive rock and post-rock. The album features lyrical themes that \u2013 while making several references to the band's home town of Grand Rapids \u2013 focus on personal loss, anger, and despair and, in the vision of the band, is a collection of unpublished \"short stories\" from a hypothetical author, complete with the author\u2019s notes and sectioned thematically by the use of four monologues. The album debuted at number 135 on the US Billboard 200 chart, selling 3,140 copies in its first week. It spent one week on the chart and charted only in the United States. Prior to its release, Wildlife was promoted with two singles, \"Harder Harmonies\" and \"The Most Beautiful Bitter Fruit\". The album was well received by critics, who mainly praised its conceptual lyrics and more melodic approach to the band's style."@en ;

The record was released in four physical versions \u2013 Version A, a CD+DVD version with music videos and live performances; Version B, another CD+DVD version with off-shot movies; Version C, a CD only version with two bonus tracks; and Version D, a fan club limited edition with a CD-Extra. Recording and writing for the album roughly began in the summer of 2013. With is described to be an album composed of nostalgic dance-pop songs that are influenced by disco and jazz, accompanied by marching drumbeats. Its lyrical content explores the general concept of love and friendship. With was a commercial success, debuting at number one on the Billboard Japan Top Albums Chart and the Oricon Albums Chart, selling 233,000 copies on the first week of release. In doing so, Tohoshinki became the first foreign artists in Japan to top the Oricon Albums Chart four times in a row. Tohoshinki are also the first foreign artists in Japan to have four consecutive albums sell 200,000 or more copies in a week. With the addition of With, Tohoshinki became the third international music act, after Simon & Garfunkel and Bon Jovi, to have released five number one albums in Japan. By the end of the year, With earned a platinum certification by the Recording Industry Association of Japan (RIAJ) for shipments of over 250,000 copies. The album has two commercially successful singles \u2013 \"Sweat / Answer\" and \"Time Works Wonders\" \u2013 both which debuted at number two on the Oricon Singles Chart and achieved Gold certifications by the Recording Industry Association of Japan (RIAJ).

Because he wrote the song in 1998 about his son, Louis, Forster later jokingly said \"I've now retitled it 'An Old Song That I Wrote about My Son.'\" \"He's four now. It was just after he was born... I like the song... I'm scared of turning into Graham Nash, you know, the sort of person who writes about their children. It's a scary area. But I think its done quite well.\" Similarly \"Ashes on the Lawn\" was intended to be included on the band's eighth studio album, Bright Yellow Bright Orange, but also failed to make the cut.

Two classics; \"Ave Maria\" and the aria \"Un bel d\u00EC vedremo\" are sung in English. Seven other arias feature on the album (two of which are hidden). The classics include Rutter's version of 'Pie Jesu' and Sarah Brightman's/Andrea Bocelli's 'Time To Say Goodbye'. There are two popular covers featured on the album which are Madonna's \"You'll See\" and Enya's \"Only Time\". The album also features seven original songs. Two of these songs are interludes that Keedie co-wrote herself; \"Interlude\" and \"Fio Est Toute\". \"I Believe My Heart\" was written by Andrew Lloyd Webber and David Zippel for their musical The Woman In White. \"My Reason\" (a favourite among Keedie fans) was composed by Guy Farley for the film Modigliani. Farley was so impressed with Keedie's voice that he approached her to sing the theme song from the film. The song is sung in English in an operatic style and is often praised for its emotional arrangement and Keedie's highly passionate delivery of the lyrics. Ben Robbins and Steve Hart both wrote the original songs \"The Star In You\" and \"All Because Of You\". Both of the songs have a pop-like arrangement but are sung operatically in English. Chris Neil is responsible for the intimate \"One Day\"."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"1985 is the fourth studio album by Enuff Z'Nuff, which features material recorded in the band's earliest days. The songs were taken from a demo at the time called \"Hollywood Squares\", originally recorded in 1985. Musically, the songs were noticeably more pop-rock in direction as opposed to the hard rock recordings they had been known for. Although nearly all original material, the opening track is a cover of Smokey Robinson's \"Tears Of A Clown\". The only new recording at the time of release was a bonus track titled \"You Got A Hold Of Me\" (sometimes referred to as \"The Valentine's Song\" due to its opening lyric). This song is noteworthy for the fact that it was used as the album's lead promotional single, despite being an unlisted \"hidden track\". The liner notes were written by popular American shock-jock and longtime fan Howard Stern. His words regarding the band were later reprinted for the band's Greatest Hits album several years later. The song \"Fingers On It\" first appeared in the cult film Henry: Portrait Of A Serial Killer, with the band credited as \"Enough Z'Nuff,\" as that was the original spelling of the band name when the movie was made. The album artwork parodies the cover design of Road & Track. The cover mentions the Ferrari car brand and State Farm financial institution."@en ;

The music was recorded in Summer 2013, in studios in Brussels, Berlin and Reykjavik. Regarding the recording process, pianist Dustin O'Halloran has commented: \"We never imagined 2013 would be such an explosively creative year. The first record took us two years from start to finish, but in the micro span of time over last summer we were able to change the formula for the way we write, record, and let go. It was incredibly liberating.\" The dance piece premiered at Sadler's Wells, London, on 9 October 2013. The album was preceded by the Atomos VII EP, which was released on April 28, 2014.

	dbo:abstract	"Coming Home (no Cantonese title) is an album recorded by Chinese Cantopop singer Faye Wong. It was released on her return to Hong Kong in 1992 after her year-long stay in New York City. Wong had issued her first three official albums under the stage name Shirley Wong. The cover for Coming Home prominently shows the name \"Faye\", and from 1994, after the release of Sky she used name \"W\u00E1ng F\u0113i\" (\u738B\u83F2) on album sleeves. Coming Home was a notable change in musical direction from the more traditional Cantopop fare of her earlier albums. Like them, it incorporated R&B influences. This album included \"Fragile Woman\", a cover of a Japanese song \"Rouge\" composed by the Jpop diva Miyuki Nakajima and sung by Naomi Chiaki. While this song had been covered by other Chinese singers[who?], Wong's version nonetheless swept over Hong Kong and single-handedly lifted her to stardom. It became the No.1 hit on almost all local radio stations and won Song of the Year at several musical awards. (Thanks to Wong's cover, this 1972 song\u2013in different language versions\u2013would in the early 1990s become a huge regional hit in Thailand, Vietnam and the rest of Southeast Asia and even Turkey; the most popular English version was titled \"Broken-Hearted Woman\".) Wong also recorded a Mandarin version of \"Fragile Woman\", released on her 1994 compilation album Faye Best (\u6700\u83F2). The album also included her first English-language song, \"Kisses in the Wind\". Wong stated in a 1994 concert that she very much liked this song, after which various websites listed it as her personal favourite."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Coming Home is the fifth studio album by American rock band New Found Glory. It was produced by the band along with Thom Panunzio and released on September 19, 2006 through Geffen Records. Written and demoed at the Morning View Mansion in Malibu, California during 2005, Coming Home is a concept album unified by a lyrical theme of being away from home and loved ones. The album marks a departure from the band's earlier work, implementing a more layered and mid-tempo sound that features various piano, keyboard, and string instrumentation more comparable to classic rock than their usual pop punk style. Coming Home was a critical success for the band, and is widely regarded as one of their best records. The album was particularly noted for its matured style, while the songs were considered the most \"mellow\" of the band's career. Despite the release of only one single, \"It's Not Your Fault\", the album was still a relative commercial success, debuting at number eight on the Billboard Rock Albums chart and number nineteen on the Billboard 200. The Japanese edition, issued on September 13, 2006, features three bonus tracks. Another bonus track is exclusively available with a digital download of the album from the iTunes Store, while Best Buy customers received a voucher inside their CD cases for the download of a fifth bonus track called \"Over Me\". The album was the band's last release on a major label, as they left Geffen Records the following year before signing with independent labels Bridge Nine and the long running Epitaph Records."@en ;

He said \"With a Little Help from my Friends\" was particularly pertinent. \"You could say that when you're a little bit down there's always someone there to pick you up, brush you down and get on with the day's work.

The album was named in reference to the success of 1992's New Miserable Experience, followed so closely by the suicide of the former band member Doug Hopkins in 1993. Reaction to Congratulations I'm Sorry was mixed, with some critics feeling that the music lay too close to the sound of the previous album. One common complaint was that most versions of the album lacked the successful 1995 single \"Til I Hear It From You\", from the Empire Records soundtrack; however, some editions of the album did contain the track as its final. The album's title, according to the lead singer Robin Wilson, came from the response band members usually received from people who both wanted to congratulate the band for the success of New Miserable Experience, while then offering apologies for their friend and former band member Doug Hopkins. The album eventually reached platinum status."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Day After Day: Live is a CD release by Rykodisc in 1990 of live recordings made by the British rock group Badfinger in 1974. During a concert tour in the Midwestern United States in 1974, Badfinger learned that the Agora venue in Cleveland, Ohio, contained a 16-track studio capable of live recordings. The group had released five studio albums up to this point but had not made any professional live recordings. Deciding to utilise the equipment, Badfinger recorded two of their shows at the Agora. Due to audio distortion and essentially a moderate performance by the group, the tapes were not used at the time. The Agora recordings circulated as bootlegs for several years before band member Joey Molland brought them to the attention of Rykodisc in 1989. Molland performed a great deal of rework to the recordings, including overdubbing his vocals, several guitars, and some of the bass. He also used a computer-sampled drum snare to enhance the original drum track. Molland also rearranged the song order of the performances, placing Pete Ham's compositions at the end of the CD. As a result of Molland's augmentation, the CD has been bitterly reviewed by music critics and fans. Complications arose for Molland in the mid 1990s when other Badfinger parties objected to the release, citing they were not properly notified. There was also some confusion as to the ownership of the original tapes, which Molland testified were taken by his wife when he resigned from the group in 1974. A lawsuit in Great Britain resolved that Molland should have proceeded differently when releasing the CD, but generally ruled in his favour regarding royalty divisions (which included Molland's compensation for production work)."@en ;

Do You Know \"straddles between contemporary gospel and inspirational R&B\" and is described as portraying \"a more intimate side of Michelle\". It contains a greater percentage of mid and up-tempo songs, along with a much heavier and grander use of live instrumentation. Williams contributed lyrically to the album as she did with her debut album, co-writing a total of six songs. However, Do You Know is much more diverse, lyrically, than its predecessor Heart to Yours, covering the themes of \"spiritual\" and \"carnal\" love and contains retrospective songs about Williams' career thus far, whilst still retaining the inspirational and encouraging lyrics that characterised Heart to Yours. In the US, Do You Know found fair success on Billboard's component charts; peaking at number two on the Gospel Albums chart, number three on the Christian Albums chart and number twenty-eight on the Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart. However, the album peaked at one-hundred-and-twenty on the Billboard 200, making it Williams' lowest-charting album. Though the album was well received by critics, it sold only 10,000 copies in its first week of release. Despite this, the album was later re-released, including two new tracks and has now sold over 78,000 copies in the US alone as of 2008.

One song on the album, \"Good Lovin' Ain't Easy To Come By\", was a hit single and remains popular to this day. Terrell had been ill, suffering from complications caused by a brain tumor, since the fall of 1967. Marvin Gaye later claimed that as a result, most of the female vocals on this album were performed by Valerie Simpson, who served as co-songwriter and co-producer for the LP with her boyfriend and future husband Nickolas Ashford. Simpson is quoted in Ludie Montgomery's biography of Terrell, My Sister Tommie, as not having subbed Terrell for vocals. Simpson again explicitly denied having done so in the liner notes to The Complete Motown Singles series. On a recent documentary on Terrell, Simpson admitted she sang with Gaye during sessions saying, \"I sang things with Marvin because Tammi was not available. And, then we would bring Tammi in to go over her parts. Those are Tammi Terrell vocals because we know that we went back in with Tammi and got what we needed.\" Gaye at the time criticized Motown for the album thinking they were taking advantage of Terrell's health. Motown assured him proceeds from the album would go to Terrell's family for insurance of her health. At the time the album was released, Terrell was on her seventh operation to cure the brain tumor that would eventually kill her after the eighth operation. The album was released on compact disc in 1992, and again in 2001 as part of The Complete Duets."@en ;

The lead single \"Looking for Water\" was released prior to the album as an exclusively internet-download release, and failed to make the charts on downloads alone. The album received mixed reviews and charted at number 24. There were hopes that a second single, the title track \"Honesty\", released on 23 January 2006, would revive interest in the album. However, the single received minimal promotion and radio airplay, despite strong video airplay on The Hits and B4, as well as limited distribution, and entered the chart at number 56. Honesty represents a distinct shift in genre from Parks' first album Introduction, which was clearly in the commercial pop genre. Honesty is predominantly alternative folk pop with some rock and chill out influences, and includes a hidden track, \"Tail and All\", with a French samba rhythm.

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/J.Lo_(album)>	rdf:type	schema:MusicAlbum ;
	dbo:abstract	"J.Lo is the second studio album and most successful album to date by American entertainer Jennifer Lopez. It was released on January 23, 2001, by Epic Records. Preceding the release for the follow-up of her commercially successful debut album On the 6 (1999). On this album, Lopez had more creative control over J.Lo. Its title refers to the nickname her fans gave her, and she described it as a homage to her supporters. Lopez began recording the album under the working title 'The Passionate Journey', writing lyrics that focused on her own personal experiences. For the album, she hired producers such as Cory Rooney, Troy Oliver, Dan Shea and Sean Combs, (her boyfriend at the time), all of whom contributed to her first album. Musically, J.Lo is a pop album, which also encompasses genres such as R&B, Latin pop, retro and dance-pop. It was considered more daring than On the 6, including more explicit language and provocative lyrics about sex; it also deals with themes of empowerment and relationships. Upon its release, the album received mixed reviews from music critics, who criticized its manufactured sound, although some praised its Spanish songs and dance material. Commercially, J.Lo became Lopez's most successful album. The album debuted at number one on the US Billboard 200, on the same week as her film The Wedding Planner, which led to the domestic box office, making her the first entertainer to have both a number one film and album simultaneously. The album was certified quadruple platinum in the United States, and became the sixth best-selling album of the year worldwide. \"Love Don't Cost a Thing\" was released as the album's lead single on December 2, 2000, which reached the top five in the United States and number one in United Kingdom. The album's second single, \"Play\" (released on March 27, 2001), reached the top twenty in most countries and top five in United Kingdom. The Latin pop song, titled \"Ain't It Funny\" was released as the album's third single on June 20, 2001. \"I'm Real\" was serviced to radio as the album's fourth and final single on September 4, 2001. To further its success, record executives at Epic recruited Ja Rule of Murder, Inc., who is popular in the Urban market, to create a remix of the song, \"I'm Real (Murder Remix)\". The remix, which featured Ja Rule, shifted Lopez's personal style from pop to a more hip-hop and urban-oriented sound. It was the number one song in the United States at the time of the September 11 attacks for 5 non-consecutive weeks."@en ;

Originally released as a double-vinyl album, and double-play cassette, it utilises recordings made in 1978 and 1980. The album charted at number 5 on the UK Albums Chart, and number 146 on the Billboard 200. Sides 1 and 2 of the vinyl are from recordings made with the Rolling Stones Mobile Studio at the Hammersmith Odeon, during the band's 1980 World Tour, whilst sides 3 and 4 are from a 1978 recording, previously issued and released in Japan only as Live at Hammersmith. The first UK CD version (EMI CZD 94) was a 2-CD set, issued in 1988, in what is now known as a 'fat-boy' double-CD case. Sides 1 and 2 of the 2-LP set were CD1; sides 3 and 4 were CD2. The later 1994 release was a single CD version, the 1978 recording of \"Come On\" being dropped to match the restrictive running-time of the single CD. Live...in the Heart of the City has since been remastered and was released in March 2007 as a 2-CD set (in a slimline double-CD case), once again featuring all the tracks of the original album, together with a 1980 recording of \"Ain't No Love in the Heart of the City\" as a bonus track.

The front cover of the CD has the title Live at Town Hall, New York City September 19\u201320, 2001, however the official title of the album is just Live in New York. Recorded less than 10 days after the September 11, 2001, attacks on New York City, the album was produced during a tour Anderson gave of the United States in which she performed a mixture of older pieces from earlier in her career and newer works, including songs from her then-recent album Life on a String, as well as earlier albums such as United States Live, Big Science, Bright Red, Home of the Brave and Strange Angels. Following so close to the attacks, Anderson makes several statements about them in her recognizable style. The performance is highlighted by a performance of \"O Superman,\" the song that launched Anderson to stardom in 1981 and that contains lyrics that can\u2014in retrospect\u2014be seen to relate to the terrorist attacks. One song, \"Progress\", is a retitled performance of the song \"The Dream Before\" which Anderson debuted in her 1986 short film What You Mean We? and later featured on Strange Angels."@en ;

The album was released on 29 September 2008 by Syco Music, Britain's Got Talent judge Simon Cowell's record label. Recorded in London, the album features both classical and popular songs, some of which had been previously performed by Johnston, including a duet with Faryl Smith. Johnston made a number of media appearances to publicise the album's launch, and appeared in his hometown of Carlisle on the day of the release, where the album sold out. Upon release, One Voice debuted at number five in the British album charts, finishing the week at number four. It also charted in Ireland, reaching number six. Critics responded positively to the album, favourably comparing Johnston to Aled Jones, and One Voice was rated gold in the UK."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Paris 1919 is the third studio album by Welsh musician John Cale. It was released in 1973 by record label Reprise. Musicians such as Lowell George and Wilton Felder worked with Cale on the release. In contrast to the experimental rock of much of John Cale's work before and after Paris 1919, the album is noted for its orchestral-influenced style, reminiscent of contemporary pop rock music. It has been suggested that one reason for the sound was the employment of Procol Harum producer Chris Thomas as producer for Paris 1919. The baroque pop ethos of some songs have been positively compared to 1960s-era releases by artists such as Brian Wilson and The Left Banke. The album has received critical praise from several publications over the years, with reviewer Jason Ankeny of Allmusic labeling the release as one \"of John Cale's very finest solo efforts\" and Stephen Holden of Rolling Stone calling it \"one of the most ambitious albums ever released under the name of 'pop'\"; he also called it a masterpiece."@en ;

It was produced by Mike Shipley on a considerable budget and marked a significant change in Winger's sound, eschewing their pop-metal anthems prevalent in their first two albums for a harder and more aggressive style of music with a good dose of socio-political leanings on tracks like \"Blind Revolution Mad\", \"In for the Kill\", and \"Who's the One\". The material was also less commercial and radio friendly, evident especially in the track \"Junkyard Dog (Tears on Stone)\" incorporating contemporary heavy metal and progressive elements and clocking in at 6:54. The album is often regarded as the favourite among the group's fans, but in terms of sales figures the album was not as successful as the two first albums, peaking at #83 on Billboard's Album chart. Pull was recorded by Winger as a trio, as guitarist/keyboardist Paul Taylor left the band after the In the Heart of the Young tour in 1992. A bonus track called \"Hell to Pay\" was available on the Japanese version of the album. This track is also included on the 2001 compilation The Very Best of Winger."@en ;

It is the band's second concept album, the first being The Man Who Stepped into Yesterday in 1987, which has never been officially released. Rift's songs convey the experience of a man dreaming about the rift in his relationship with his girlfriend. Recorded in September and October 1992 and produced by Muscle Shoals music veteran Barry Beckett, the album was released by Elektra Records on February 2, 1993. All songs were written by Trey Anastasio and Phish lyricist Tom Marshall except \"Mound\" and \"Weigh\" by bass guitarist Mike Gordon and \"Lengthwise\" by drummer Jon Fishman. The instrumental, \"All Things Reconsidered\", is an intentional variation on the theme to the National Public Radio news show All Things Considered, and has been featured on the show itself several times. An orchestral version of the song appears on Trey Anastasio's 2004 solo album Seis De Mayo. The cover art was created by New York-based painter David Welker, who worked closely with the band during winter 1993 in order to visually depict each of the album's tracks in a single image, with the notable exception of \"The Horse\". (For this reason, a horse intentionally appears on the cover of Phish's next album, Hoist). Relix magazine listed Rift as one of the most iconic album covers of all time in 2007.
