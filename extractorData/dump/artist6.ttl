	dbo:abstract	"Kimberly Kay \"Kim\" Richey (born December 1, 1956 in Zanesville, Ohio) is an American singer/songwriter. Though her work fits into the general country music category, her sound is not easily categorized. Her songs have been hits on both the country and pop charts. She has often been described as an Americana artist. Her 1995 self-titled debut album provided her first country hit, \"Just My Luck\", as well as the follow-up \"Those Words We Said\" (which was also covered that same year by Trisha Yearwood). Her follow-up album, 1996's Bitter Sweet featured a more pop-oriented sound. In 1997, \"Let the Sun Fall Down\" (from her debut album) was featured in the Buffy the Vampire Slayer episode, \"Never Kill A Boy On The First Date\" (episode 1.05). Although Richey did not appear in concert in the episode (as Velvet Chain did), her song played over the episode's emotional climax, in the penultimate scene. In 1999, \"Come Around\" (from her album \"Glimmer\") was used in the movie \"For Love of the Game\" starring Kevin Costner, Kelly Preston and John C. Reilly.

Nomi was known for his bizarrely visionary theatrical live performances, heavy make-up, unusual costumes, and a highly stylized signature hairdo which flaunted a receding hairline. His songs were equally unusual, ranging from synthesizer-laden interpretations of classical opera to covers of 1960s pop standards like Chubby Checker's \"The Twist\" and Lou Christie's \"Lightnin' Strikes\". He is remembered in the United States as one of David Bowie's backup singers for a 1979 performance on Saturday Night Live. Nomi died in 1983 at the age of 39 as a result of complications from AIDS."@en ;

Lohan began her career as a child fashion model when she was three, and was later featured on the soap opera Another World for a year when she was 10. At age 11, Lohan made her motion picture debut in Disney's commercially and critically successful 1998 remake of The Parent Trap. Her next major motion picture, Disney's 2003 remake of Freaky Friday, was also a critical and commercial success. With the release of Mean Girls (2004), another critical and commercial success, and Disney's Herbie: Fully Loaded (2005), another commercial success, Lohan became a teen idol sensation, a household name and a frequent focus of paparazzi and tabloids. However, Lohan's next starring role in the romantic comedy Just My Luck (2006), received poor reviews and was only a modest commercial success. Following Just My Luck, Lohan focused on smaller, more mature roles in independent movies, receiving positive comments on her work, including A Prairie Home Companion (2006), Bobby (2006) and Chapter 27 (2007). After recording several songs for her movie soundtracks, Lohan signed with Casablanca Records. Lohan's debut studio album, titled Speak, was released in December 2004 and became the first high-seller from Casablanca in several years, selling 1 million copies in the United States alone and peaking at number four on the Billboard 200. Though the album received mostly lukewarm reviews, it was certified platinum. Lohan's second album, titled A Little More Personal (Raw), was released in December 2005 and featured darker material than her debut had. That album received mixed reviews, and it was certified gold. In 2007, two driving under the influence incidents led to Lohan being put on probation, and together with three visits to rehabilitation facilities caused the loss of several movie deals. In 2008 and 2009, Lohan worked as a fashion model and launched the clothing line 6126. She resumed her acting career with TV work in 2008, and starred in the TV film Labor Pains (2009). She appeared in Robert Rodriguez's feature film Machete (2010). Between 2010 and 2013, Lohan went into rehabilitation three times, and spent much of her time entangled in legal problems stemming from misdemeanors and probation violations. In 2012 and 2013, she did further television work, including starring as Elizabeth Taylor in the biographical TV film Liz & Dick (2012). In 2013, she starred in Paul Schrader's independent film The Canyons. In 2014, the docu-series Lindsay aired on the Oprah Winfrey Network, and Lohan made her stage debut in the London West End production of Speed-the-Plow."@en ;

He is most famous for being the composer of the jazz standard \"Afro Blue\", recorded by John Coltrane among others. In 1950 he moved to New York City where he played with Perez Prado, Tito Puente, Cal Tjader, Fania All Stars, etc. He was an integral figure in the fusion of Afro-Cuban rhythms with R&B and soul, paving the way for the boogaloo era of the late 1960s. His 1963 hit rendition of Herbie Hancock's \"Watermelon Man\" was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 1998. Mongo Santamar\u00EDa was one of a handful of Cuban congueros (\"conga players\") who came to the United States in the 1940s and 1950s. Other notable congueros who came to the U.S. during that time include Armando Peraza, Chano Pozo, Francisco Aguabella, Julito Collazo, Carlos Vidal Bolado and Modesto Dur\u00E1n. Many consider Santamar\u00EDa to have been the greatest conga drummer of the twentieth century. Santamar\u00EDa inspired the stage name of Japanese actor Y\u016Bsuke Santamaria. Additionally, his name is used as a pun in the film Blazing Saddles. When the character Mongo enters a scene, a Spanish-speaking peasant cries, \"Mongo! Santa Maria!\" before fleeing in terror."@en ;

He is famous for composing the soundtracks to the anime series Rurouni Kenshin and the popular video game franchises Tenchu and Way of the Samurai. He is well known for combining traditional Japanese music with elements of rock, jazz, and other world music. He is a native of Itabashi, Tokyo, and entered the music industry in the early 80's, composing music for television programs and movies, as well as producing music for a number of Japanese pop stars during the 80's and early 90's. In 1996, he composed the soundtrack to Rurouni Kenshin, where, through the duration of the series, combined rock with a more traditional Japanese sound, giving it the spirit of classic Jidaigeki movies, but also incorporated modern elements\u2014such as electric guitars and breakbeats--into the score, giving the soundtrack a contemporary feel to it. He was very noted for this achievement, and applied this style to his later works. His work has been released on numerous CDs, and has aspirations of composing music for a major Hollywood motion picture. Contrary to popular belief, \"Add'ua\", the theme song to the first Tenchu game was not sung in Japanese, but rather in the West African language of Hausa, at his wife's request. \"Sadame\", the theme song for Tenchu: Wrath of Heaven, and \"Kurenai No Hana\", the theme song for Tenchu: Fatal Shadows, were performed in Japanese. Asakura lives in Tokyo and operates his own music studio, Mega-Alpha. He composes music for television programs, anime, and video games."@en .

Perez was born in Los Angeles, California. Her family later moved to Montclair, California. She graduated from Montclair High School in 2001. When she was 11 years old, Perez won a music contest held in the Los Angeles-area Lynwood. As part of the prize package, she recorded an album that launched her musical career . She has since recorded several more albums. Her career was especially enhanced when she signed with the Fonovisa label, part of the Univision Music Group. Perez followed in the footsteps of her father and grandparents who were also exponents of banda music. Her minor-label albums exhibited all the traditional characteristics of banda, but from D\u00E9jenme Llorar (2003) onwards she has combined the banda sound with modern elements such as rap as well as introducing set-piece dialogues into some tracks. Her music also shows other influences from hip hop and R&B artists - this has led her to include Spanglish phrasing in some lyrics, such as in the duet Estoy Enamorada with Don Cheto. Perez therefore, while continuing to exemplify traditional banda, has placed her own stamp and interpretation on this genre. In 2005, P\u00E9rez was nominated for a Urban Artist of the Year at the 17th Lo Nuestro Awards. Perez has also performed public service announcements and has been involved with other charitable work. In 2006 she volunteered to help with the \"Got Milk\" campaign, explaining that Latin American women tend to worry about outer beauty but need to also focus on their diet."@en .

Brumley was born near Spiro, Oklahoma on October 29, 1905. Pre-Dustbowl Oklahoma was primarily made up of sparse agricultural communities; Brumley's family was no different.

The Institute was led by Eugene Monroe Bartlett (1884\u20131941), owner of the Hartford Music Company and composer of the well-known gospel song \"Victory in Jesus\". Brumley purchased Hartford Music Company in 1948. Brumley married Goldie Edith Schell in 1931. They lived on the banks of Big Sugar Creek in Powell, Missouri, where they raised six children. \"I'll Fly Away,\" \"Turn Your Radio On,\" \"If We Never Meet Again (This Side of Heaven),\" \"I'll Meet You In The Morning,\" and \"He Set Me Free\" are among a host of favorites written by Albert E. Brumley. He wrote over 800 songs. He established the Albert E. Brumley Sundown to Sunup Gospel Sing (now Albert E. Brumley Gospel Sing) in 1969 in Springdale, Arkansas. Brumley has been inducted into the Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame, Gospel Music Hall of Fame, and Oklahoma Music Hall of Fame. Albert Brumley was a member of the Church of Christ and is buried at Fox Church of Christ Cemetery near Powell, Missouri. He died November 15, 1977.

After making her debut as a child actress in Barney & Friends, Lovato rose to prominence in 2008 when she started in the Disney Channel television film Camp Rock and signed a recording contract with Hollywood Records. Her debut album, Don't Forget (2008), debuted at number two on the US Billboard 200. In 2009, Lovato received her own television series, Sonny with a Chance. The following album, Here We Go Again, debuted at number one on the U.S. Billboard 200, while its title track became her first single to reach the top 20 of the Billboard Hot 100, peaking at fifteen. Both albums have been certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). After the release of additional television films and their soundtracks in 2010, Lovato's personal issues put her career on hiatus and ended Sonny with a Chance after its second season. Her third album, Unbroken (2011), addresses several of her difficulties. Its lead single, \"Skyscraper\", became Lovato's second top 10 entry in the US, while its second single, \"Give Your Heart a Break\", was certified triple platinum in the country. Lovato was a judge and mentor on the American version of The X Factor in 2012 and 2013. Her third album, Demi (2013), had first-week sales of 110,000 copies (the best debut week of Lovato's recording career) and debuted at number three on the Billboard 200. Its lead single, \"Heart Attack\", became her third top 10 in the US and her first in the UK. Lovato's fifth album, Confident (2015), debuted at number 2 on the Billboard 200. Its lead single \"Cool for the Summer\" was eventually certified double platinum by the RIAA. Musically, Lovato is considered a pop, pop rock, and R&B artist. Lovato has won a number of awards, including an MTV Video Music Award, 13 Teen Choice Awards, five People's Choice Awards, an ALMA Award, and a Billboard Touring Award. In 2013, Maxim ranked her 26th on its Hot 100 list and Billboard ranked her second on its Social 50 Artists of the Year list. Outside the entertainment industry, Lovato is involved with several social and environmental causes. In May 2013, she was cited for her dedication as a mentor to teens and young adults with mental health challenges at a National Children's Mental Health Awareness Day hosted by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration in Washington, D.C. She has also become an advocate for the LGBT community. In 2014, she was announced as the Grand Marshal for LA Pride week, and that same year she became the face for Human Rights Campaign's Americans for Marriage Equality Campaign. In April 2016, Lovato was honored with the GLAAD Vanguard Award for making a significant difference in promoting equal rights for LGBT people at the 27th GLAAD Media Awards."@en ;

Box (1980\u20131986; 2001\u20132005). In 1977, he was discovered by the P. Mobil members on a Napsug\u00E1r-concert and was brought to play in the band. In 1978 they recorded a live album which should have been the first P. Mobil release, but it was released only in the spring of 1999. In 1980 he departed with S\u00E1ndor Bencsik and formed P. Box (after a Procol Harum song). He settled in Debrecen (220 km from the capital) in 1986, and the distance caused him to disband P. Box. The other members of the band continued for a short while as Metal Company, then they united with Gyula De\u00E1k \"Bill\", so their name became \"Bill \u00E9s Box\". S\u00E1ndor Bencsik left Hungary in 1987, but died suddenly in Austria. Cserh\u00E1ti started a studio in his home, where he discovered the band \"Szfinx\", becoming its manager. In 1999 the first two full-length albums were re-released on CD, remastered. In 2001 he revived P. Box, with two Szfinx and two Aberra members. They released a returning single, and a year after a new album came out. In 2003 they released the first ever official concert album of P. Box. In 2005, they started to record the new album Pangea. At this time, doctors found out Cserh\u00E1ti was ill with cancer. Despite this, they continued the recordings, and Pangea came out in July. He died in mid-August."@en ;

Known as the \"Ghazal King\", he gained acclaim together with his wife, another renowned Indian ghazal singer Chitra Singh in the 1970s and 1980s. Their combination album comprising music from the films, Arth and Saath Saath is the HMV's largest selling combination album of all time. Sajda (An Offering, 1991), Jagjit Singh's magnum opus double album with Lata Mangeshkar holds the same record in non-film category. He sang in numerous languages. He was awarded the Padma Bhushan by the government of India in 2003. In February 2014, Government of India released a postal stamp in his honour. Singh is credited for the revival and popularity of ghazal, an Indian classical art form, by choosing poetry that was relevant to the masses and composing them in a way that laid more emphasis on the meaning of words and melody evoked by them. In terms of Indian Classical music, his style of composing and Gayaki (singing) is considered as Bol-pradhan, one that lays emphasis on words. He highlighted this in his music for films such as Prem Geet (1981), Arth and Saath Saath (1982), and TV serials Mirza Ghalib (1988) and Kahkashan (1991). Jagjit Singh is considered to be the most successful ghazal singer and composer of all time in terms of critical acclaim and commercial success. With a career spanning five decades and a repertoire comprising over 80 albums, the range and breadth of his work has been regarded as genre-defining. He is the only composer and singer to have composed and recorded songs written by former Prime Minister of India Atal Bihari Vajpayee \u2013 also a poet \u2013 in two albums, Nayi Disha (1999) and Samvedna (2002). Singh's 1987 album, Beyond Time, was the first digitally recorded release in India. He was regarded as one of India's most influential artists. With sitar legend Ravi Shankar and other leading figures of Indian classical music and literature, Singh voiced his concerns over politicisation of arts and culture in India and lack of support experienced by the practitioners of India's traditional art forms, particularly folk artists and musicians. He lent active support to several philanthropic endeavours such as the library at St. Mary's School, Mumbai, Bombay Hospital, CRY, Save the Children and ALMA."@en ;

After leaving a rock band, participating in the Lower East Side's avant garde performance art circuit, and being dropped from a contract with Def Jam Recordings, Gaga worked as a songwriter for Sony/ATV Music Publishing. From there, recording artist Akon noticed her vocal abilities and helped her to sign a joint deal with Interscope Records and his own KonLive Distribution. Her debut album The Fame (2008) was a critical and commercial success that produced global chart-topping singles such as \"Just Dance\" and \"Poker Face\". A follow-up extended play (EP), The Fame Monster (2009), was met with a similar reception and \"Bad Romance\", \"Telephone\", and \"Alejandro\" were released becoming successful singles. Her second full-length album Born This Way was released in 2011, topping the charts in more than 20 countries, including the United States, where it sold over one million copies in its first week.

In 2014, Gaga released a collaborative jazz album with Tony Bennett titled Cheek to Cheek, which became her third consecutive number one in the United States.

She's also known as 'Bo Bo' or 'Little Witch'. Mavis began her singing career in the mid 90s as a pop idol, singing songs catered mostly towards children and young teenagers. For example, the lyrics to 'Health Song' encouraged daily exercise and was accompanied by a music video in the style of a fitness video. However, she soon grew tired of her childish image and increasingly gravitated towards singing about moodier subject matters having to do with love and betrayal. She has expressed that she is no longer concerned with being a pop star and will only make music to her liking. Mavis was raised only by her mother, since her parents separated when she was just two years old. Her mom forged her unbreakable bond with music. She was sent to learn the flute and piano at the age of three, since her mom, an aspiring singer, had put all of her own musical dreams in Mavis. They led a tight life. Her mom had to sing at bars to afford Mavis' tuition for the best music school in Taiwan. Mavis did not let her mom down. She began to sing on stage at 14. Time has brought about many changes to both her life and her music, but her passion for expression has never changed. At 17 years old, she began to sing children's songs. In the late 1990s, she adopted a more mature image, singing in a variety of pop styles for a more general audience, which captured much popularity."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Muthuswami Dikshitar (March 24, 1775 \u2013 October 21, 1835) was a South Indian poet and composer and is one of the Musical Trinity of Carnatic music. His compositions, of which around 500 are commonly known, are noted for their contemplative nature and for capturing the essence of the raga forms through the vainika (veena) style that emphasises gamakas. They are typically in a slower speed (chowka kala). He is also known by his signature name of Guruguha which is also his mudra (can be found in every one of his songs). His compositions are widely sung and played in classical concerts of Carnatic music. The musical trinity consists of Dikshitar, Tyagaraja (1767\u20131847), and Syama Sastri (1762\u20131827) although, unlike the Telugu compositions of the others, his compositions are predominantly in Sanskrit. He also had composed some of his Kritis in Manipravalam.(admixture of Tamil and Sanskrit) Muthuswami Dikshitar was born in Tiruvarur (of Thiruvarur district in what is now the state of Tamil Nadu) to a Tamil Iyer Brahmin couple Ramaswami Dikshitar(discoverer of Raaga Hamsadhwani) and Subbamma, as the eldest son. According to the account of Subbarama Dikshitar, Muttuswami Dikshitar was born in the manmatha year, in the month of TamilPanguni under the asterism Krittikaa. He was named after the temple deity, Muttukumaraswamy; legend has it that he was born after his parents prayed for a child in the Vaitheeswaran Temple. He had two younger brothers Baluswami, Chinnaswami and a sister Balambal. In keeping with the tradition, Muthuswami learnt the Sanskrit language, Vedas, and other important religious texts. He obtained his preliminary musical education from his father. While he was still in his teens, his father sent him on a pilgrimage with a wandering monk named Chidambaranatha Yogi to gain musical and philosophical knowledge. Over the course of this pilgrimage, he visited many places in North India and acquired a broad outlook that is reflected in many of his compositions. During their stay in Kashi (Varanasi), his guru Chidambaranatha Yogi, presented Dikshitar with a unique Veena and died shortly thereafter. The sam\u0101dhi of Chidambaranatha Yogi can still be seen in Sri Chakra Lingeshwar temple at the Hanuman Ghat area in Varanasi."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Alun Davies (born 1943) is a Welsh guitarist, studio musician, recording artist, and composer who rose to fame primarily with his supporting guitar work and backing vocals as accompanist for English musician Cat Stevens, from early 1970 to 1977. Prior to his association with Stevens, Davies co-wrote, sang, and performed on two albums: in 1963, with Jon Mark, (known then as John Michael Burchell) and in 1968, as a part of a band with Mark and three others called Sweet Thursday, when folk-rock music was still in its infancy. When their label declared bankruptcy, Davies was invited to join Cat Stevens as a session musician, who was attempting to change his sound and advance in the music world. Davies' experience, similar tastes in the emerging folk-rock genre, and capabilities with guitar and voice placed him in a pivotal role in Stevens' career, resulting in hit songs and a string of RIAA platinum certified breakthrough albums. Two such albums, Tea for the Tillerman and Teaser and the Firecat, propelled Stevens to stardom and a stellar musical career, and solidified a friendship between the two men. Davies, who recorded a solo album after a few years of backing Stevens found comparatively little commercial success on his own, particularly after several years of sitting in Stevens' charismatic shadow. He continued to tour with him and recorded on all but one of his albums, until Stevens' conversion to Islam and retirement from the pop scene in 1977. Since that time, many \"box sets\", compilations, and \"best hits\" albums have been assembled for sale with Davies' guitar work and vocals on each album. In late 2005, when Stevens (now known as Yusuf Islam) returned again to write and perform, he did so with the amicable support of his friend and long-time right-hand man Davies, although nearly three decades had passed, and the two men had followed extremely different paths during the interim. Davies continues to perform with Yusuf to the present day, in addition to pursuing other musical projects."@en ;

A favorite amongst Deadheads for many years, he helped to introduce a tapers section at Grateful Dead concert to allow audience recording of live concerts. Healy would sometimes provide direct output from the soundboard for the tapers to directly patch into their recorders. He was a pioneer in rock sound system innovation, and helped Bear along with Ron Wickersham of Alembic design the Dead's \"Wall of Sound\" concert sound system. He also helped perfect the ultra-matrix soundboard setup which was used by the Dead from 1986 through 1990. Some fans and collectors of the band's live recordings deem this setup to be the band's best-sounding, and most practical. Healy has also undertaken record production duties on occasion, such as when he produced the 1960s San Francisco psychedelic band The Charlatans' eponymous debut album. Healy was also the bass player for Hoffman's Bicycle (later Bycycle) that played the Bay Area for 18 months from the Summer of 1968."@en ;

Nikolovski was born in Skopje, Socialist Republic of Macedonia in 1947. His popularity peaked in 1990, when his song \"Biser Balkanski\" won 1st prize at the Folk Fest Valandovo 1990 Song Festival, an annual competition in which singers from the former Yugoslavia competed to find the best song. The song became an instant classic in the Republic of Macedonia, even becoming somewhat of an anthem to a nation just starting off after its breakup from Yugoslavia. Nikolovski was also given the nickname \"Biser Balkanski\" following the song. Throughout the 1990s, Nikolovski went on to release several other hits, but none would measure up to the success that he found with \"Biser Balkanski\". In 1992, Nikolovski took part in the Canberra '92 Festival, a concert similar to the annual Valandovo song festival, with the song \"Od Majka Nema Pomila\".

	dbo:abstract	"Giuseppe \"Joe\" Venuti (possibly September 16, 1903 \u2013 August 14, 1978) was an Italian-American jazz musician and pioneer jazz violinist. Considered the father of jazz violin, he pioneered the use of string instruments in jazz along with the guitarist Eddie Lang, a friend since childhood. Through the 1920s and early 1930s, Venuti and Lang made many recordings, as leader and as featured soloists. He and Lang became so well known for their 'hot' violin and guitar solos that on many commercial dance recordings they were hired to do 12- or 24-bar duos towards the end of otherwise stock dance arrangements. In 1926, Venuti and Lang started recording for the OKeh label as a duet (after a solitary duet issued on Columbia), followed by \"Blue Four\" combinations, which are considered milestone jazz recordings. Venuti also recorded commercial dance records for OKeh under the name \"New Yorkers\". He worked with Benny Goodman, Adrian Rollini, the Dorsey Brothers, Bing Crosby, Bix Beiderbecke, Jack Teagarden, Frank Signorelli, the Boswell Sisters, and most of the other important white jazz and semi-jazz figures of the late 1920s and early 1930s. However, following Lang's death in 1933, Venuti's career began to wane, though he continued performing through the 1930s, recording a series of commercial dance records (usually containing a Venuti violin solo) for the dime store labels, OKeh and Columbia, as well as the occasional jazz small group sessions. He was also a strong early influence on western swing players like Cecil Brower. (Many of the 1920s OKeh sides continued to sell through 1935, when ARC reissued selected sides on the 35-cent Vocalion label.) After a period of relative obscurity in the 1940s and 1950s, Venuti played violin and other instruments with Jack Statham at the Desert Inn Hotel in Las Vegas. Statham headed several musical groups that played at the Desert Inn from late 1961 until 1965, including a Dixieland combo. Venuti was with him during that time, and was active with the Las Vegas Symphony Orchestra during the 1960s. He was 'rediscovered' in the late 1960s. In the 1970s, he established a musical relationship with tenor saxophonist Zoot Sims that resulted in three recordings. In 1976, he recorded an album of duets with pianist Earl Hines entitled Hot Sonatas. He also recorded an entire album with country-jazz musicians including mandolinist Jethro Burns (of Homer & Jethro), pedal steel guitarist Curly Chalker and former Bob Wills sideman and guitarist Eldon Shamblin. Venuti died in Seattle, Washington."@en ;

Born in Los Angeles, California, Carnes now resides in Nashville, Tennessee, where she continues to write music. She began her career as a songwriter in the 1960s, writing for other artists while performing in local clubs and working as a session background singer with the famed Waters sisters (featured in the documentary, 20 Feet from Stardom). After she signed her first publishing deal with Jimmy Bowen, she released her debut album Rest on Me in 1972. As a solo artist, Carnes saw some success with her singles \"More Love,\" \"Crazy in the Night (Barking at Airplanes),\" \"Make No Mistake (He's Mine),\" with Barbra Streisand, and \"I'll Be Here Where the Heart Is.\" Her most successful single was \"Bette Davis Eyes,\" released in 1981. The song won two Grammy Awards; Song of the Year and Record of the Year, and became the best-selling single of the year in the United States. Carnes' self-titled debut album primarily contained self-penned songs, including her first charting single \"You're a Part of Me\", which reached number thirty-five on the Billboard Adult Contemporary chart in 1975. In the following year, Carnes released Sailin', which featured \"Love Comes from Unexpected Places\". The song won the American Song Festival and the award for Best Composition at the Tokyo Song Festival in 1976. Other successes as a songwriter include co-writing the number one duet \"The Heart Won't Lie\" with Donna Weiss, recorded by Vince Gill and Reba McEntire, and co-writing the songs for Kenny Rogers' concept album Gideon (1980). Her distinctive raspy vocal style has drawn comparisons to Rod Stewart."@en ;

A native of Ume\u00E5, Norrland, Morgan \u00C5gren was spotted as an outstanding talent at a young age as he began performing publicly at age seven, and eventually joined forces with Mats \u00D6berg in 1981. They later formed \"Zappsteetoot\" together in 1984, a band internationally known for performing Frank Zappa's music. In 1988, at the age of 20, Morgan \u00C5gren was, along with Mats \u00D6berg, invited by Frank Zappa to do a guest performance at Zappa's Stockholm concert. Impressed by \u00C5gren's skills, Zappa invited \u00C5gren to the States to partake in several projects, including the 1994 Grammy Award winning CD, Zappa's Universe, with Steve Vai as well as a sold out New York performance of Zappa's classical program at Lincoln Center's Great Performers Series in Avery Fisher Hall. \u00C5gren also shares the drummer's seat with Terry Bozzio on Dweezil and Ahmet Zappa's band Z's album Shampoohorn. In 1996, \u00C5gren has toured throughout Europe as a member of Glen Hughes band, and later to Japan in 1997. 1996 also saw the formation of Morgan \u00C5gren's own record label, Ultimate Audio Entertainment, dedicated to the release of \"new\" music. \u00C5gren has recorded several albums as a member of Fleshquartet (Swedish: Fl\u00E4skkvartetten), amongst them What's Your Pleasure? and the Grammy Award winning Goodbye Sweden in addition to his international performances with Zappa\u2019s Universe and with Mats \u00D6berg in Mats/Morgan Band.

Puw's works include pieces for unusual combinations of instruments, such as a tuba quartet or a trio consisting of harp, cello and double-bass, as well as more traditional forces such as solo baritone and piano, choir or orchestra. He was associated with the BBC National Orchestra of Wales as its Resident Composer, the first holder of this title, from 2006 to 2010. Puw wrote an Oboe concerto as part of this association, and his latest composition for the orchestra was premiered at the 2007 Proms. Puw's own Welsh identity is a recurrent theme in his music: some of his pieces set Welsh-language poetry to music and one of his pieces, Reservoirs, is written about the flooding of Welsh valleys to provide water for England."@en .

Born in Belgrade as the only child of well-known theatre and television director Slavoljub Stefanovi\u0107-Ravassi and Desanka Nikoli\u0107. After finishing elementary school, Margita enrolled in the \"Josip Slavenski\" music high school from which she graduated as the most talented pianist in her class alongside Ivo Pogoreli\u0107. Her impressive school performance led to an offer of further studies at the famed Moscow Conservatory, which she ended up turning down due to family reasons\u2014her mother very much disliked the idea of letting her go to Moscow by herself at such a young age. Instead, Margita enrolled at the University of Belgrade's School of Architecture where she was no less successful. Throughout her architecture studies she still continued practicing the piano as well as playing and occasionally touring with various small orchestras. After graduating university in 1982, along with her then-boyfriend Sr\u0111an Vejvoda, she began to take an interest in Belgrade's underground music scene, which struck her as a completely different lifestyle from the one she was used to. During the spring of 1982 she was introduced to Milan Mladenovi\u0107 by her cousin Gagi Mihajlovi\u0107. Soon thereafter, at one of Katarina II's early rehearsals, she got an offer to join the band. After returning from a three-month trip to South America she decided to take the still-standing offer, joining Katarina II in late 1982. Margita was Katarina II/Ekatarina Velika's member until its very end in late 1994. During her time with the band she also collaborated on the albums of many other Yugoslav bands such as Karlowy Vary produced by Tomo in der M\u00FChlen, Elvis J. Kurtovi\u0107 & His Meteors, Van Gogh, Babe, etc. She composed the score for several TV films (\"Prvi put s ocem na jutrenje\", \"Vera Hofmanova\", \"Povratak Vuka Alimpi\u0107a\", \"Plavi plavi\") and theatre productions (\"Klasni neprijatelj\", \"Tri sestre\"). In 1985 she was introduced as an actress (the role of Dragana) in the movie \"Tajvanska kanasta\" (The Taiwan Canasta) directed by Goran Markovi\u0107. After Milan's death and Ekatarina Velika's end, Magi continued her work as a musician. During 1994/1995 she played in a band called Kurajberi, which gathered several Belgrade musicians and was focused mainly on performing covers at club gigs and jam sessions. In 1995, with a group of young Belgrade musicians involved in a techno movement, she formed a band called EQV and released an album Ti si sav moj bol (You are All of My Anguish) named after the famous Ekatarina Velika song, the album itself containing a techno version of the same song. The album was published by the Austrian label Coop Arts & Crafts Unlimited. In October of the same year, EQV participated in Tactic Festival in Vienna. She further continued contributing as a guest star on albums and concerts of many Serbian bands and occasionally played with bands Glisers, Zion banda and Direktori. In 1996 she played several unplugged concerts with Elektri\u010Dni orgazam, one of which was recorded and released the same year by B92 as \u017Divo i akusti\u010Dno (Live and Acoustic). During that time she was also involved in several significant music projects (\"S one strane duge\", \"Pesme iznad Istoka i Zapada\"). Sometime in 1996 Margita became a member of Ars Antibari writers society from Bar, which published several of her stories in two books (\"Izgleda da \u0107e Jugo\", Bar, 1996, and \"Da li da ti ka\u017Eem ko te je ubio, Gea?\", Belgrade, 1999). In 2002 she composed the music for \"Kaput mrtvog \u010Doveka\" (The Coat of a Dead Man) theater play directed by Hajdana Baleti\u0107, which turned out to be Magi's last ever music-related work. However, from 1996 onwards her life was mostly spent struggling with heroin addiction and the physical effects of long-term drug use. Following the passing of her father in February 1996, Margita's drug problems intensified. In order to support her habit, she sold pretty much all of her possessions including an apartment in downtown Belgrade. She used part of the money for a trip to India and also to buy two smaller apartments. Not long thereafter she sold those as well and eventually ended up living in a ramshackle modified garage in the suburb of Bor\u010Da. By this time she was basically penniless, depending on charity and handouts for even the basics such as food. Margita Stefanovi\u0107 spent the last years of her life living in a homeless shelter in Vo\u017Edovac. She was diagnosed to be HIV positive, which she contracted through intravenous drug use. She died on 18 September 2002 (aged 43) at the Belgrade Hospital for Infective Diseases where she had been sequestered since August of the same year."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Bruce Cameron (1955 \u2013 October 16, 1999) was a guitarist who managed to attract a number of famous rock-and-roll musicians to record his 1999 debut and only album, Midnight Daydream, released by Brain Cell Records (North Carolina). The unlikely cast of supporting musicians for this seemingly obscure album included: \n* Jack Bruce (Cream, B.L.T., and solo career). \n* Mitch Mitchell (Jimi Hendrix Experience, Gypsy Sun and Rainbows, and Ramatam). \n* Buddy Miles (Band of Gypsys, Electric Flag, Buddy Miles Express). \n* Ken Hensley (Uriah Heep, Blackfoot). \n* Harvey Dalton Arnold (Outlaws). \n* Neal Smith (Alice Cooper). \n* Michael Bruce (Alice Cooper). \n* Bunk Gardner (The Mothers of Invention). \n* Billy James (Ant-Bee). \n* Billy Cox (Band of Gypsys, Gypsy Sun and Rainbows). The entire album was self-recorded and engineered by Derrick Acker of Quetzal Recording and Cameron at his own home studio in North Carolina. It was seemingly self-funded and promoted based on the quality of the website, advertisements and production quality. Funds were available due to Cameron's family wealth, allowing him to bring together talent and production for his dream project. A press conference concerning the release was held at the Hilton Hotel in Wilmington, North Carolina, on September 15, 1999. Those present included Buddy Miles, Billy Cox, Cameron, and Cameron collaborator Billy James. Publicity material touted the group of musicians as a reunion of the famous Hendrix band, The Band of Gypsys, on the then Cameron-run website. Full page advertisements promoting the album had been run in a nationally distributed guitar magazine. Within a month of the press conference, Cameron committed suicide, ending a rather curious and short high-profile career of recording with world class greats known to millions. The album has been under-represented to the public by its artists, who have tended not to list them in any public forums (with a couple of exceptions). But, the fact remains that the record is a notable one due to the involvement of so many Jimi Hendrix alumni players along with great bassist Jack Bruce among others. The record itself was a \"buffet\" of styles that mirrored the past releases of the guest talents involved. For example, the title track, \"Midnight Daydream,\" which featured Band of Gypsys singer/drummer Buddy Miles, sounds like a Hendrix guitar-driven song. He has a son, Riley Cameron, who is determined to become the guitarist his dad wanted to become. Riley is the guitarist of a band that is currently recording their first album. He lives in Rocky Point, North Carolina."@en .

He is also known as the father of popular singer Boris Novkovi\u0107. Novkovi\u0107 was believed to have been born in \u0160abac, Serbia, although some sources cite Sarajevo. to a Croatian mother and a Serb father, Vuka\u0161in, a violinist, so his musical talent was discovered very early, and he joined the musical school in Sarajevo at the age of 6. After graduating conducting from Musical Academy in Sarajevo, he founded a band Pro Arte during the fall of 1967. In 1968, \u0110or\u0111e's wife Ozana gave birth to their son Boris, and the family moved to Zagreb. Boris later became a rock singer-songwriter, but he split abruptly with his father at the age of 19. \u0110or\u0111e's first hit came in 1969 with the song \"Vi\u0161e se ne\u0107e vratiti\" performed by Mi\u0161o Kova\u010D and sold in half a million copies, and a later version in 1985 had similar success. In 1973, Pro Arte merged with another Sarajevo pop group Indexi, but the experiment lasted only several months. Pro Arte existed in continuity until 1980, as well as off-and-on throughout the 1980s. In 1989 Novkovi\u0107 moved to live in Rovinj, Croatia. After Pro Arte, \u0110or\u0111e Novkovi\u0107 switched to writing songs, creating material for some of the hits of the former Yugoslavia.

After Tito's death he composed the music for the song \"Dru\u017Ee Tito mi ti se kunemo\", which was then performed by Zdravko \u010Coli\u0107 which was then sold in 350,000 copies. Novkovi\u0107 composed music for the infamous thank-you schlager \"Danke Deutschland\" produced in January 1992 by Croatian state television as a show of gratitude to Germany for their role in international recognition of their independence. In 1993 he wrote the song \"Don't Ever Cry\" for Put, the first Croatian representative in the Eurovision Song Contest. Since 1997, he co-owned and managed the Croatia Records label, together with Miroslav \u0160koro. In 2000, he moved to Zagreb again. In 2003 Novkovi\u0107 gained a lot of popularity as judge of Story Supernova Music Talents, a reality show for aspiring musicians similar to Popstars aired on Nova TV.

Sanborn has also worked extensively as a session musician, notably on David Bowie's Young Americans (1975). One of the most commercially successful American saxophonists to earn prominence since the 1980s, Sanborn is described by critic Scott Yannow as \"the most influential saxophonist on pop, R&B, and crossover players of the past 20 years.\" Sanborn is often identified with radio-friendly smooth jazz. However, Sanborn has expressed a disinclination for both the genre itself and his association with it. In his three-and-a-half-decade career, Sanborn has released 24 albums, won six Grammy Awards and has had eight gold albums and one platinum album. He continues to be one of the most highly active musicians of his genre."@en ;

He met future bandmate Omar Rodr\u00EDguez-L\u00F3pez at the age of 13 and apparently introduced Omar to another close friend and collaborator Cedric Bixler-Zavala. Rodriguez-Lopez and Bixler-Zavala would later ask him to join At the Drive-In after some significant member changes in 1996, making him a part of the band's most successful line up. After at the Drive-In took an indefinite hiatus in 2001, Hinojos, along with fellow ATDI members Jim Ward and Tony Hajjar, formed the band Sparta. Hinojos left Sparta in 2005, quoted as saying, \"My time with Sparta has run its course, and simply wasn't fun anymore.\" A few days later, it was announced that he had joined The Mars Volta, where he took up the role of 2nd guitar in addition to 'sound manipulator' (previously occupied by Jim Ward's cousin Jeremy). In February 2009 at the 51st annual Grammy Awards, Hinojos, along with fellow Mars Volta bandmates was awarded the Grammy for Best Hard Rock Performance for the song \"Wax Simulacra\", from the album \"The Bedlam in Goliath\".

He founded ABKCO Music & Records Incorporated. Klein revolutionized the income potential of recording artists, who previously had been routinely victimized by onerous record company contracts. He first scored massive monetary and contractual windfalls for Buddy Knox and Jimmy Bowen, one-hit rockabillies of the late 1950s, then parlayed his early successes into a position managing Sam Cooke, and eventually managed the Beatles and the Rolling Stones simultaneously, along with many other artists, becoming one of the most powerful individuals in the music industry during his era. Rather than offering financial advice and maximizing his clients' income, as a business manager normally would, Klein set up what he called \"buy/sell agreements\" where a company owned by Klein became an intermediary between his client and the record label, owning the rights to the music, manufacturing the records, selling them to the record label, and paying royalties and cash advances to the client. Although Klein greatly increased his clients' incomes he also enriched himself, sometimes without his clients' knowledge (the Rolling Stones $1.25M advance from Decca in 1965 was deposited into a company that Klein set up and the fine print of the contract didn't require Klein to release it for 20 years). Klein's involvement with both the Beatles and Rolling Stones would lead to years of litigation and, specifically for the Rolling Stones, accusations from the group that Klein had withheld royalty payments, stole the publishing rights to their songs, and neglected to pay their taxes for five years (necessitating their French \"exile\" in 1971). After years of pursuit by the IRS Klein was convicted of a misdemeanor charge of making a false statement on his 1972 tax return, for which he spent two months of 1980 in jail."@en ;

He is best known for his two Top Ten hits, the first in 1958 on Josie Records called \"Do You Want to Dance\" and the second in 1964 for Autumn Records, \"C'mon and Swim\". \"Do You Want to Dance\" was covered later (as \"Do You Wanna Dance\") by Del Shannon, the Beach Boys, Johnny Rivers, Bette Midler, John Lennon, Cliff Richard, Marc Bolan & T.Rex, the Mamas & The Papas, Bobby Vee and the Ramones. \"C'mon and Swim\" was written and produced by 20-year-old Sylvester Stewart, later known as Sly Stone. Freeman began his recording career at age 14 with the Romancers, who recorded briefly for Dootone Records. At age 17, he scored a hit with \"Do You Want to Dance\" and appeared on the pop charts with various follow-ups through 1961. In 1964, he was back in the Top Ten with the dance-craze hit \"C'mon and Swim\", which reached Number 5. The craze had cooled by the time he released his follow-up \"S-W-I-M\" which failed to sell as well (#56), but he continued to tour widely over the next few years. In 1964, Bobby Freeman played nightly at the Condor Club in San Francisco where Carol Doda performed her topless go-go dancing shows. Mainly supporting himself as a singer in clubs by the late 1960s, he released another single in 1974 on Touch Music, but it met with little commercial success. He has performed at the Bay Area Music (\"Bammy\") Awards in recent years."@en ;

He was active from 1954 until his death during which time he largely sang and played the accordion. Chavis was also a prolific writer of zydeco songs. Many of his songs have become standards of the zydeco repertoire, in spite of, or perhaps because of, their generally idiosyncratic and quirky construction and subject matter. \"If it's wrong, do it wrong, with me,\" he would tell his band. \"If I'm wrong, you wrong, too!\" His wife's name was Leona and they had six children, Wilson Jr., Margret, Louanna, Charles, Licia, and Rellis Chavis and had over 20 grandchildren. Boozoo was crowned \"The King of Zydeco\" in New Orleans in the 1990s. His son Charles was a member of his band at the time."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Dennis Linde (March 18, 1943 \u2013 December 22, 2006) was an American singer and songwriter whose work was primarily in country music. He is best known for writing the 1972 Elvis Presley hit, \"Burning Love\". Presley performed the song live a few times, but often had trouble with the lyrics and soon pulled it from his playlist, although he did perform it during his famous show Aloha from Hawaii. Dennis Linde wrote numerous hit songs for mainly country music singers, beginning with hits for Roger Miller and Roy Drusky in 1970. In 2000, his song for the Dixie Chicks, \"Goodbye Earl\", stirred some controversy for its take on spousal abuse. Linde also wrote tunes that were recorded by Tanya Tucker, Gary Morris, Don Williams, The Judds, Alan Jackson, Mark Chesnutt and Garth Brooks, among several other acts. He also wrote two songs for the film Grease 2: \"Cool Rider\" and \"Reproduction.\" Although Linde was the sole writer of most of his songs, he occasionally collaborated with the likes of country artist Mel McDaniel and Nashville songwriter Bob DiPiero. He was known as one of the more reclusive figures on the Nashville scene, rarely attending industry events and preferring not to be photographed or interviewed. Nashville manager Scott Siman described him as a \"mystery man,\" explaining, \"If you ever saw Dennis Linde it was amazing, because you didn't get that opportunity very often.\" In 2001, Linde was inducted into the Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame. Linde died of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis at Vanderbilt University Medical Center at the age of 63."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Joseph Jean-Baptiste Laurent Arban (28 February 1825 \u2013 8 April 1889) was a cornetist, conductor, composer, pedagogue and the first famed virtuoso of the cornet \u00E0 piston or valved cornet. He was influenced by Niccol\u00F2 Paganini's virtuosic technique on the violin and successfully proved that the cornet was a true solo instrument by developing virtuoso technique on the instrument. He was born in Lyon, France, one of the ten children of Simon Arban, artificier. An older brother was the balloonist Francisque Arban. He studied trumpet with Francois Dauvern\u00E9 at the Paris Conservatoire from 1841 to 1845. He was appointed professor of saxhorn at the \u00C9cole Militaire in 1857, and became professor of cornet at the Paris Conservatoire in 1869, where Merri Franquin was among his students. He published his Grande m\u00E9thode compl\u00E8te pour cornet \u00E0 pistons et de saxhorn in Paris in 1864. This method, which is often referred to as the \"Trumpeter's Bible,\" is still studied by modern brass players. His variations on The Carnival of Venice remains one of the great showpieces for cornet soloists today. \"Fantasie Brilliante\" also continues to be frequently performed and recorded. Arban apparently made a phonograph cylinder recording for the Edison Company shortly before his death. In a newspaper from Finland, Helsinki's Hufvudstadsbladet, (no. 96, from 11.4.1890, page 2), Arban's recording is mentioned: Among the phonograms a particular one must be mentioned: solo on cornet a piston, played by the famous French virtuoso monsieur Arban called \u201CFanfare d\u2019Edison;\u201D Arban died in Paris on April 8, 1889. The Arban Method book is available by various publishers, with Carl Fischer and Alphonse Leduc being the most prominent. In 1982 Carl Fischer released a version that is annotated by Claude Gordon, noted pedagogue. The 1982 Carl Fischer version restores the original text and designates the previous revisions by Walter Smith and Edwin Franko Goldman. Then, Claude Gordon makes comments in the footnotes for clarification and cross referencing supporting material. Arban's original text did not advocate many things that are purported by recent teachers and this edition is useful for historic accuracy."@en .

Born and raised in Wollongong, New South Wales, she began her acting career in 1998 with guest appearances in television shows. Bassingthwaighte rose to prominence in 2003 on the Australian soap opera Neighbours for her role as Izzy Hoyland, which earned her three Logie Award nominations. In 2004, she was recruited as the lead singer of Australian electro-pop band, Rogue Traders. After leaving Neighbours in 2006 to focus on her music career, Bassingthwaighte released a cover of \"Don't Give Up\" with Shannon Noll, which peaked at number two on the ARIA Singles Chart and was certified platinum. In 2008, she left Rogue Traders to pursue her solo music career. Bassingthwaighte released her debut solo album 1000 Stars in 2009, which spawned the platinum top-ten hits \"Alive\" and \"Someday Soon\". The album was a commercial success, debuting at number-one on the ARIA Albums Chart and was certified gold. Aside from her acting and music career, Bassingthwaighte co-wrote her first book, Sistahood: A Journal of Self-Discovery, with her younger sister in 2008. That same year, she made her debut as a television presenter, hosting So You Think You Can Dance Australia until 2010 when the show was axed. From 2011 to 2014, she was a judge and mentor on The X Factor Australia, and later joined The X Factor New Zealand in 2015. Bassingthwaighte has been married twice; in 1998 she married Graham Wilmott, a chef from Wollongong, for two years. In December 2011, she married her former Rogue Traders' bandmate Cameron McGlinchey. The couple have two children, a daughter named Harper Rain Sinclair McGlinchey and a son named Hendrix John Hickson McGlinchey."@en ;

He was a founding member and the original bass guitarist for The Kinks, from 1963 until 1969. He also sang backing vocals on some of their records. Quaife founded a group known as The Ravens in 1963 with brothers Ray and Dave Davies. In late 1963 or early 1964, they changed their name to The Kinks, and hired Mick Avory as a drummer. The group scored several major international hits throughout the 1960s. Their early singles, including \"You Really Got Me\" and \"All Day and All of the Night\", have been cited as an early influence on the hard rock and heavy metal genres. In the band's early days, Quaife, who was generally regarded as the best-looking member, was often their spokesman. Following a ban from touring the United States in 1965, The Kinks focused their efforts on the UK market. Singles such as \"Sunny Afternoon\" (1966) and \"Waterloo Sunset\" (1967) showcased lead singer Ray Davies' observational writing style and became Top Ten hits throughout Europe and the UK. Quaife played an important role on the group's influential album The Kinks Are the Village Green Preservation Society, which featured a strong theme of nostalgia. He departed from The Kinks in 1969 and formed the band Mapleoak, which he left in April 1970. After retiring from the music business, Quaife resided in Denmark throughout the 1970s. He relocated to Belleville, Ontario in 1980, where he worked as a cartoonist and artist. He was diagnosed with renal failure in 1998 and moved back to Denmark in 2005. Quaife died in June 2010 of kidney failure."@en ;

She is perhaps best remembered for the single \"Fen Fei\" (\u5206\u98DB). Between 1998 and 2001 she scored a series of hits in Taiwan. Most of her songs were upbeat, catchy, melodic dance tracks, often with youthful themes or lyrics. Her song \"Angel\" featured a chorus of kids singing along with her. Other well-known Yuki Hsu songs include \"Ai De Ding Dong\" (\"Ring A Ling\" by Danish singer Tiggy written by CMN aka Christian M\u00F8ller Nielsen, Heidi Lykke Larsen and Henrik Carlsen), \"Who's Naughty\" (remake of Dr. Bombay song \"Calcutta (Taxi Taxi Taxi)\"), and a remake of the '90s techno track \"Dub-i-Dub\". In 1999 she paired up with South Korean rapper Yoo Seung Jun to record the duet \"Can't Wait\", which brought her some fame outside of Taiwan. She was also famous for the flamboyant and outlandish hairdos she sported in many of her music videos. After 2001 she stopped recording and turned her career to work in Taiwanese dramas.

During the 1950s, she started singing professionally, eventually abandoning her career as an actress in the 1960s. Since then, she has recorded more than 35 discs. As a singer, she has specialized in traditional Spanish and Latin American music: bolero, copla, ballad, ronda, vals, and folk music (Peruvian, Argentinian, Mexican, and Venezuelan). Her contralto voice has a deep resonance and sure melodic footing which must stem from classical training. Her pronunciation is pure Castilian, and her music pure Latin American. Her repertoire encompasses some of the most memorable melodies from Mexico, Peru, Venezuela and Chile and her interpretations close to genuine. She typically sings accompanied by guitars, requintos, and drums. She sang for close to 30 years with the same group, Los Gemelos, formed by twin brothers, Santiago L\u00F3pez Hern\u00E1ndez and Juli\u00E1n L\u00F3pez Hern\u00E1ndez, until the death of Santiago in the early 1990s."@en .

Samardzic was the founder and owner of Tanoa Night Club, the first and most award winning International Yugoslavian/Balkan live music venue, with performances by many top Balkan artists including \u0160aban \u0160auli\u0107; Lepa Brena; and Sinan Saki\u0107, in Switzerland, as well as Valentino Night Club in Austria which both received strong national media attention from SFR Yugoslavia. While achieving great success with Balkan music, Samardzic also owned one of the largest night clubs in Switzerland called Villa Wahnsinn between 1990 and 1992 which also became one of the most famous night clubs among German, Austrian and Swiss folk-pop music. Prior to his entertainment career, Samardzic began his path as a police officer in SFR; Sarajevo, Cazin, and Pula, during the 1970s, after finishing high school through the police academy while becoming a black belt martial artist in Jiu-Jitsu, Karate and Judo. With his dynamic physical strengths, he quickly found his passion in sports; he became an active European football player, playing for professional clubs across Europe such as NK Istra, and FC St.Gallen during the early 1980s. As a businessman, he has been involved in various ventures and industries which mainly included hospitality, entertainment, sports, and commercial real estate. He is married to Ayla Almira Samardzic. As a rising handball player, it was due to her business studies that she needed to quit her promising player career. She became a mannequin and was Jafra's cosmetic face. Samardzic and his wife have two children, Alemario Esos Samardzic (born 2001) and Ayline Esina Samardzic (born 2002). Both of her children count as upcoming tennis talents."@en ;

Sometimes characterized as \"the first tycoon of teen\", Spector is considered the first auteur among musical artists, acting not only as a producer, but also the creative director, writing or choosing the material and masterminding all phases of the recording process. He is acknowledged as one of the most influential figures in pop music history. He began his career in 1958 as the producer and co-founder of the Teddy Bears, performing on guitar and vocals, and penning their US number one single \"To Know Him Is to Love Him\". At the height of his success, he wrote, co-wrote, or produced for girl groups such as the Ronettes and the Crystals, and later, the Beatles' John Lennon and George Harrison \u2013 often using the Los Angeles conglomerate \"the Wrecking Crew\" as his de facto house band. Spector's other chart-topping singles include \"You've Lost That Lovin' Feelin'\" (the Righteous Brothers, 1964), \"The Long and Winding Road\" (the Beatles, 1970), and \"My Sweet Lord\" (Harrison, 1970). By the mid 1970s, Spector had produced more than twenty-five US Top 40 singles for various artists, but following sporadic work with Leonard Cohen, Dion DiMucci, and the Ramones, he remained largely inactive. In 2008, The Washington Times named Spector the second greatest record producer in music history. In 2004, Rolling Stone magazine ranked him #63 on their list of the \"Greatest Artists of All Time\". In their 2003 list of \"The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time\", they included the Spector-produced Presenting the Fabulous Ronettes (1964), A Christmas Gift for You (1963), and Back to Mono (1991). According to BMI, \"You've Lost That Lovin' Feelin'\" (co-written and produced by Spector) is the song that received the most US airplay in the 20th century. For co-producing Harrison's Concert for Bangladesh (1971), Spector earned the Grammy Award for Album of the Year. In 1989, Spector was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a nonperformer. In 1997, he was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame. From 2007\u201309, Spector was the subject of a trial and retrial for the 2003 murder of actress Lana Clarkson, of which he was convicted in the second degree. He is serving a prison sentence of 19 years to life and will be 88 years old before becoming eligible for parole."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Andrew Latimer (17 May 1949, Guildford, Surrey, England) is an English musician and composer who is founder and one of the original members of the progressive rock band Camel. He is mainly a guitarist and singer, but also a flautist and keyboardist. Latimer's most common guitar of choice is a Gibson Les Paul, but he is also known for playing Fender Stratocasters and other guitars. From the 1990s onward, he also played a Burny Super Grade, an 80s copy of the Gibson Les Paul Model. The amplifiers he uses range from Fender, Vox, and Marshall. He established a music production named Camel Productions which released Camel's new albums: Dust And Dreams (1991), Harbour of Tears (1996), Rajaz (1999) and A Nod and a Wink (2002). In May 2007, Susan Hoover, Latimer's wife, announced through the Camel Productions website and newsletter that Latimer had suffered from a progressive blood disorder polycythaemia vera since 1992, which had later progressed to myelofibrosis. This was part of the reason why Camel ceased extensive touring. In late 2007, he underwent a bone marrow transplant. As of September 2008, he was back home and finally recovering his strength, even considering the possibility of a smaller-scale tour in the future. After an extended absence, news regarding Latimer came via a blog from David Minasian, who has directed several Camel video productions over the years. Minasian released his album, Random Acts of Beauty, in August 2010. Latimer's health had progressed to the point that he contributed guitar solos, and vocals to the album's opening track, \"Masquerade\". In October 2013, Camel returned to touring for the \"Retirement Sucks\" tour, playing the Snow Goose in its entirety, the album having been re-recorded earlier in the year. The re-recording remains remarkable faithful to the original, but includes some minor rearrangements and some extended sections. Due to nearly all venues selling out, they added a second half to the tour in early 2014. A live DVD, \"In From The Cold\" was released, recorded at the Barbican Centre London. The second half of the tour featured Ton Scherpenzeel on keyboards, as Guy Leblanc had become seriously ill. No touring was undertaken for the rest of 2014 as Latimer had a knee replacement, but he has recovered and Camel will play several dates in July 2015. Marillion guitarist Steve Rothery has cited Latimer as one of the biggest influences on his playing. Latimer received a Lifetime Achievement award in the 2014 Progressive Music Awards."@en ;

Starting out in 1963 with the group The Wailers, he forged a distinctive songwriting and vocal style that would later resonate with audiences worldwide. The Wailers would go on to release some of the earliest reggae records with producer Lee \"Scratch\" Perry. After the Wailers disbanded in 1974, Marley pursued a solo career upon his relocation to England that culminated in the release of the album Exodus in 1977, which established his worldwide reputation and produced his status as one of the world's best-selling artists of all time, with sales of more than 75 million records. Exodus stayed on the British album charts for fifty-six consecutive weeks. It included four UK hit singles: \"Exodus\", \"Waiting in Vain\", \"Jamming\", and \"One Love\". In 1978 he released the album Kaya, which included the hit singles \"Is This Love\" and \"Satisfy My Soul\". Diagnosed with acral lentiginous melanoma in 1977, Marley died on 11 May 1981 in Miami at age 36. He was a committed Rastafari who infused his music with a sense of spirituality. He is considered one of the most influential musicians of all time and credited with popularising reggae music around the world, as well as serving as a symbol of Jamaican culture and identity. Marley has also evolved into a global symbol, which has been endlessly merchandised through a variety of mediums."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Michael Eugene Archer (born February 11, 1974), better known by his stage name D'Angelo (pronounced dee-Angelo), is an American, Grammy Award winning R&B and Neo soul singer, songwriter, multi-instrumentalist and record producer. Born in Richmond, Virginia, the son of a Pentecostal minister, he began teaching himself piano as a very young child, and at age 18 he won the amateur talent competition at Harlem's Apollo Theater three weeks in a row. After briefly being a member of a hip-hop group called I.D.U., his first major success came in 1994 as the co-writer and co-producer of \"U Will Know\". His debut solo album, Brown Sugar, released in July 1995, received rave reviews and sold over two million copies. Along with artists like Erykah Badu, Lauryn Hill, Maxwell, and collaborator Angie Stone, D'Angelo became part of the Neo soul movement. Following this D'Angelo went on a hiatus before releasing Voodoo in January 2000, which debuted at number one. Its lead single \"Untitled (How Does It Feel),\" was a smash on the R&B charts and won a Grammy for Best Male R&B Vocal; likewise, Voodoo won for Best R&B Album. Following the release of \"Untitled (How Does It Feel),\" D'Angelo became more uncomfortable with his growing status as a sex symbol. This was followed by numerous personal struggles including alcoholism, and a fourteen-year musical hiatus. D'Angelo released his third studio album, Black Messiah, in December 2014, although it was originally set for release in 2015; the album was met with critical acclaim and fared well on music charts, peaking at number five on the US Billboard 200."@en ;
