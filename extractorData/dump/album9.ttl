He began to write songs for the album as he awaited trial for federal weapons and possession charges. Unlike his past albums, he wrote his lyrics down on paper, which he had not done since his debut album, I'm Serious (2001). The album debuted at number one on the Billboard 200, selling 568,000 copies in its first week, becoming T.I.'s highest debut sales to date, and the fourth highest debut of the year. The album was eventually certified double platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) on August 27, 2009. It received generally favorable reviews from critics, and is T.I.'s most successful album to date. The album spawned eight singles, four of which reached the top five of the Billboard Hot 100, with two singles peaking at number one."@en ;

Pink Moon differs from Drake's previous albums in that it was recorded without a backing band, featuring just Drake on vocals, acoustic guitar and a brief piano riff overdubbed onto the title track. Released two years before Drake's death in November 1974, at the age of twenty-six, the lyrical content of Pink Moon has often been attributed to Drake's ongoing battle with depression. The songs are shorter than on his previous albums, with a total album running time of just over twenty-eight minutes. Pink Moon, like Drake's previous studio albums, did not sell well while he was still living but has since gained in critical acclaim and record sales."@en ;

Preceded by the non-album single \"Charlotte Sometimes\" late the previous year, Pornography was the band's first album with a new producer, Phil Thornalley, and was recorded at RAK Studios from January to April. The sessions saw the group on the brink of collapse, with heavy drug use, band in-fighting and group leader Robert Smith's depression fuelling the album's musical and lyrical content. Pornography represents the conclusion of the group's early dark, gloomy musical phase which began with Seventeen Seconds in 1980. Following its release, bass guitarist Simon Gallup left the band and the Cure switched to a much brighter and more radio-friendly new wave sound. While poorly received by critics at the time of release, Pornography was their most popular album to date, reaching number 8 in the UK charts. Pornography has since gone on to gain acclaim from critics, and is now considered an important milestone in the development of the gothic rock genre.

	dbo:abstract	"Right About Now: The Official Sucka Free Mix CD or simply Right About Now was released by Talib Kweli in November 2005 and is generally considered a mixtape. However, some people regard this release as an official album because of its availability through commercial sites and its release of two singles. It also lacks the DJ overlays often accompanied by mixtapes which makes the CD read more like an official album. This CD is notable because, although a low-key release, it features upcoming members of Kweli's record label, Blacksmith Music. The album sold 16,000 copies in its first week of release, debuting at #113 on the Billboard 200. The appearance of Mos Def on the track Supreme Supreme is another key point of the album as Talib Kweli and Mos Def had not rapped together on a track since Kweli's Quality album in 2002. There was some controversy regarding the song \"Ms. Hill\", (a dedication song to artist Lauryn Hill) which features an uncredited and illegal sample of a Ben Kweller song."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Santa Monica '72 is a live album by David Bowie, recorded at Santa Monica Civic Auditorium on 20 October 1972 during the Ziggy Stardust tour. Taken from an FM radio broadcast, it was available only as a bootleg for more than 20 years; according to author David Buckley, possessing a copy was the test of a \"proper Bowie fan\". The recording was issued officially by the Golden Years label in 1994, with Griffin Music handling the American release in 1995. This live album features a quite different setlist to the one found on Ziggy Stardust - The Motion Picture (1983) (namely that, with the exception of The Jean Genie, the setlist contains no songs from Aladdin Sane, which were very present by the end of the tour), which was recorded nine months afterwards and similarly bootlegged prior to its belated official release. The Santa Monica recording is generally considered a superior representation of the Ziggy Stardust concerts in terms of both sound quality and standard of playing. In 1981, NME critics Roy Carr and Charles Shaar Murray called it not simply \"the performer's best ever bootleg\", but \"far superior to either of Bowie's official location recordings\" to that date, David Live (1974) and Stage (1978). A gold disc edition with the DJ's closing remarks at the end was made available in the Netherlands, while in the US a special limited box set was released that included a t-shirt, a key chain and a short video. The video was not actually from the Santa Monica show, but was previously unseen footage from a silent colour film made at a concert in Dunstable, England on 21 June 1972. The video was combined with the live audio recording from the Santa Monica concert. This box was limited to only 1000 copies. In addition, an even more limited edition was released as a small wooden box with Bowie's image carved into the lid, and a brass plate indicating the series number. Only 250 copies were made. This semi-legal release was one in the series of mid-nineties releases by MainMan, Bowie's former management company during the seventies (other ones being RarestOneBowie and the Ava Cherry & The Astronettes album People from Bad Homes). All these albums were released without Bowie's approval and are currently deleted. An official version \u2014 Live Santa Monica '72 \u2014 was issued by EMI/Virgin in 2008."@en ;

Sugar & Spice was Harrison's first of many independently\u2014released projects through her own label imprint Planet 9. The album came to surface when 2007's Liberation was leaked in Japan after her former label Universal Motown forgot to pull it back from release in that territory without Harrison's knowledge. Instead of spending a year and \"hundreds of thousands of dollars\" in court suing her record label, Motown/Universal, she opted out of her contract. From there, Japan asked her to record more albums exclusively for the Japanese market because Japan loved Liberation. Recorded between the months of September 2008 and November 2008, production was primary handled by a variety of low\u2014profile producers; enlisting the help of Arkatech Beatz, Riddim Fingaz, The Smith Bros, and Duke Williams among others. Harrison, took full creative control co-writing the entire album with producer Christopher Moore and served as executive producer. Guest features included rappers Tre, Faith Boogie, and dancehall musician Sean Paul.

The album was released on September 20, 2013 through Beluga Heights Records and Atlantic Records and its affiliated record labels. Incorporating a base core of R&B, pop and electronic dance music, Derulo wanted the album to be \"totally different\" from his previous albums and show the growth in his writing and his overall performance saying \"there are so many twists and turns on the album... It's important when someone thinks they've figured you out to flip them\". A deluxe edition of the album featuring 3 bonus tracks, was released simultaneously alongside the eleven-track standard edition, which will only be made available in some European and Oceania countries. Derulo co-wrote every song on the album, also its production was handled by RedOne, Ricky Reed, DJ Frank E, Jonas Jeberg and Martin Johnson as well as others, to handle production for the album. This was the first album not to feature production from J.R. Rotem, who previously produced every song on Derulo's debut album and three songs on his second album, Future History. In total Derulo had written over 300 songs and recorded between 100 to 120 songs for the album over a one-year period. Amongst those included are collaborations with rappers 2 Chainz, The Game and Pitbull, in addition to his longtime girlfriend Jordin Sparks who features on a song called \"Vertigo\". Occasionally the album dips into other genres such adult contemporary and soul music. Tattoos was promoted with live renditions of the album's songs during The Tattoos World Tour.The album was also preceded by the release of the lead single, a Joshua \"Ammo\" Coleman and Martin Johnson production called \"The Other Side\", which peaked at number two on the UK Singles Chart. A second single, \"Talk Dirty\", featuring American hip hop artist 2 Chainz, was released on August 2, 2013, it has since topped the charts in the United Kingdom and 13 other countries. Follow-up singles \"Marry Me\" was released a month before the album and reached the top-ten in Australia and top-twenty in New Zealand, whilst \"Trumpets\" was released in November 2013, peaking at number one in Australia and on the UK R&B singles chart. \"Stupid Love\" was released on March 24, 2014, as the fifth overall single and is currently impacting charts. Upon its release, the album received generally mixed reviews from music critics, some noting that the album helped Derulo bring out his more \"sensitive side\" compared to previous his work. Tattoos debuted at number five on the Australian Albums Chart and the UK Albums Chart, where it became his highest charting album in that country. Only a five track extended play under the same title, was released in the United States, while the full length repackaged version of the album was released on April 15, 2014 under the new title, Talk Dirty.

The album was banned by several major retailers including HMV due to its sexually explicit title and cover art. Under the direction of James Anderton copies were seized, along with other records by Crass and the Dead Kennedys, by Greater Manchester Police from Eastern Bloc record shop. Frank Schofield was charged with displaying \"Obscene Articles For Publication For Gain\". The album's lyrical content, ironically, concerned violence between men and women, based on the experiences of a band member who had been sexually assaulted. The title was a Dada-style ploy to get attention for this social message. The band, its two record labels and its publishing company were also charged under the Obscene Publications Act, but all charges were dropped. The album also featured artwork by Crass guitarist Andy Palmer. The Fucking Cunts... reached number two on the UK Indie Chart, spending fifteen weeks on the chart in total.

The band worked on the album for close to three years and it was their first album of new material since 1999's Wonderful. The band showcased a number of songs from the new album during three concerts at London's Hackney Empire in June 2008. The 10-minute title track recounts the social history of a corner of east London that until 1900 was controlled by St Paul's Cathedral. As a 'liberty' it was not legally independent, but the rights of the Crown over the land had been waived. A shortened version of the track \"The Liberty of Norton Folgate\" was made available on YouTube in mid May 2008. In December a boxset of the album was offered for pre-order on the Madness website; those who ordered were entitled to a digital download of the album on 20 December. Twenty-three tracks were recorded for the album, although fifteen made it on to the album to be released in May. The twelve tracks issued in the digital download leaked onto the internet on 25 December 2008.During concerts in Sydney, Melbourne and Adelaide at the end of March 2009, Suggs stated that \"Dust Devil\" would be the second single off the new album; second when accounting for the 2008 release of NW5. It was released on 11 May, one week before the album. A third single, \"Sugar and Spice\" (with slightly different lyrics and intro to the album version) was released to radio in July, and on 21 July it was confirmed that it would be made available as a download single from 2 August on iTunes and 3 August from other retailers. In November 2009 the band announced the release of a fourth single scheduled for 11 January 2010: \"Forever Young\", a favourite of both fans and band. Apart from several remixes, one of the single formats contains Love Really Hurts (Without You), a Dangermen era cover of the Billy Ocean classic. The release was put back one week and the single was released on 18 January, becoming the second single from the album to fail to chart. It was produced by Clive Langer and Alan Winstanley, who have worked with Madness on all but one of their albums. Recording sessions also took place in Toe Rag studios in late 2006 with Liam Watson, who engineered and mixed Elephant by The White Stripes."@en ;

The following year, MTV2 held a fan's choice poll for the Best Metal Videos of 2004. The results aired on the December 25 edition of Headbangers Ball with \"Self Medicate\" ranking in at #18.

dbr:This_Perfect_World	rdf:type	schema:MusicAlbum ;
	dbo:abstract	"This Perfect World is the third album by singer-songwriter Freedy Johnston. It was released in 1994 on Elektra Records. It is an album steeped in regret and loss. The narrator of \"Across the Avenue\" is unable to get past the memory of seeing his lover killed in a pedestrian accident. In \"Two Lovers Stop,\" a young couple commit suicide rather than let themselves be ripped away from each other. The title track concerns a dying old man returning to apologize to his estranged daughter for unspecified past misdeeds. Among the other songs, \"Evie's Tears\" apparently refers to sexual abuse (evidently by a priest), and \"Dolores\" is based on Nabokov's Lolita. Despite the preponderance of dark subject matter, the album has a jaunty feel as Johnston demonstrates an ability to craft winning pop melodies. Reviews of the album were overflowing with praise, although those same reviewers also generally felt that it didn't quite measure up to his previous album, 1992's Can You Fly. This Perfect World was produced by Butch Vig, who also played on the album's minor hit, \"Bad Reputation.\" Other notable contributors include cellist Jane Scarpantoni, who performed on two tracks, and Marshall Crenshaw."@en ;

To the Power of Three was met with negative reviews and was a commercial failure, having reached just number 97 in the U.S. Billboard 200. Jason Ankeny wrote to AllMusic a one-sentence review in which he admitted that \"...To the Power of Three fails to recapture the magic of Keith Emerson and Carl Palmer's past collaborations\" and gave the album a 2-out-of-5 star rating. \"Talkin' Bout\", being the only single released from the album, peaked at number 9 in the Mainstream Rock chart."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Welcome to the Pleasuredome is the debut studio album by Frankie Goes to Hollywood, first released by ZTT and Island Records on 29 October 1984. Originally issued as a vinyl double album, it was assured of a UK chart entry at number one due to reported advance sales of over one million. The album was also a top ten seller internationally in countries such as Switzerland, Sweden, and New Zealand. While commercially successful, the album also drew criticism for containing new versions of all of the songs from the group's (already much-remixed) hit singles from the same year (\"Relax\" and \"Two Tribes\", plus B-side \"War\"), as well as a surfeit of cover versions in lieu of much new original material. It was later revealed that Trevor Horn's production dominated the record so thoroughly that the band's own instrumental performances were often replaced by session musicians or Horn himself. Frankie's second album, Liverpool, actively featured the full band. However, the album's evergreen ballad \"The Power of Love\" subsequently provided the group with their third consecutive UK number one single. To celebrate the album's 30th anniversary, in October 2014, ZTT through Union Square Music released a limited edition (2000 copies only) boxset entitled \"Inside the Pleasuredome,\" available exclusively from the website pledgemusic.com. Mopping up rarities on 10\" vinyl, as well as a book, a DVD, a cassette (featuring 13 mixes of Relax and its b-side \"One September Monday\") as well as a new 2014 remastered version of the album on 180g vinyl, the boxset cost \u00A385 to buy."@en ;

Not an immediate success, the three singles released from it failed to crack the Top 40 in the UK, nor did any of them enter the Billboard Hot 100. \"Who Needs Love Like That\" would eventually make the British Top 10 in 1992, and \"Oh L'amour\" became a UK Top 20 in 2003, both in remixed form promoting their Pop! The First 20 Hits and Hits! compilations respectively. However, the album fared better in both Germany and Sweden, where it was a Top 20 success. Erasure's initial exposure in the US came via dance clubs, as two singles did hit the top ten on Billboard's Hot Dance Music/Club Play chart. At the time of its release, Wonderland was considered a failure, especially when comparing it to Clarke's prior successes with Depeche Mode and Yazoo. Early reviews of the album dubbed Bell as an Alison Moyet imitator[citation needed]. Wonderland is widely revered as a classic example of mid-80s synth pop, by most critics, and is appreciated now as the beginning stages of one of electronic music's most enduring acts."@en ;

It was released on Blackout Records in December, 2003 and it follows the Posthumous EP which was released in the same year. The album takes influence from several musical styles with an overall melodic hardcore sound. In line with the band's horrorcore imagery, the cover depicts a photograph of a cassette tape clipped to a blood-soaked diary. The inlay follows this theme through, with the lyrics largely in handwriting as if in a diary. The label on the CD itself is black with a splash of red to symbolise a bloodstained handprint. The song material and lyrics are quite dark, covering subjects consistent with the cover and inlay image, such as zombies, murder, conflict, and personal rejection. In spite of all this imagery, the band still felt the need to add a liner note proclaiming, \"These songs are fictional and aren't a veiled threat to anyone living or dead. Seriously\"."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Level II is the fourth album by R&B group, Blackstreet, released on March 11, 2003. It was their first and only album released on the record label DreamWorks Records. The album's title was a reference to its members' best known line-up during their most successful album, 1996's Another Level. Two of the members returned for the recording of Level II. Mark Middleton returned to the fold after he was replaced by Terrell Phillips on 1999's Finally to launch a gospel music career. Dave Hollister returned on the song \"Bygones\", as he also left the group to start his solo career. Founding members Teddy Riley and Chauncey Hannibal patched things up to record Level II. A few years earlier, they were involved in a very public dispute that signaled the group's demise at the end of 1999. After Blackstreet's eventual dissolution, Riley entered into a short-lived reunion with his previous group Guy. Hannibal attempted a solo career, while Eric Williams returned to writing and producing for other artists such as Dave Hollister, Donell Jones and Jaheim. Riley also attempted a solo career as well, with a deal with Virgin Records in 2000. His solo recording Black Rock was shelved despite promotional copies of the album being issued. Another project that he worked on was the Capitol Records singer Michael \"Mike E.\" Etheridge, a former member of The Neptunes. His debut album Master Plan- which was executive produced by Riley- was also shelved, and as a result, several songs on the unreleased albums made their way on Level II. \"Look In The Water\" was originally recorded by Mike E. for his album, but Riley re-recorded the song with Blackstreet's vocals. Several songs from Riley's unreleased album Black Rock (\"Friend Of Mine\", \"You Made Me\", \"Deep\" and \"Bygones\") were also re-recorded for this album. Level II was released with little to no promotion, as DreamWorks Records was on the verge of being absorbed by their previous label Interscope Records."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Melody Road is Neil Diamond's debut album as an artist signed to Capitol Records. His 32nd studio album, it is the first album of original music Diamond has recorded since 2008's well-received Home Before Dark, which debuted on the US album charts at #1. It was produced by Don Was and Jacknife Lee. After 40 years recording for Columbia, Diamond signed with Capitol in early 2014. At the same time, his back catalogue was moved to Universal Music Group, Capitol's parent company. Capitol released Diamond's 1980 soundtrack album for The Jazz Singer. On September 8, 2014, six of the tracks from Melody Road were premiered at the Capitol Records studios in Hollywood, CA at a listening party for a small group of music industry executives and journalists. Following the event, Billboard wrote that the album is \"rich in orchestration that retains the dark rustic qualities of his last two studio albums of original material, 12 Songs and Home Before Dark. Of the songs, the article stated that \"'Something Blue', the most commercial of the songs played Monday, has the classic Diamond mid-tempo lilt; the ballads 'The Art of Love' and '(Ooo) Do I Wanna Be Yours' offer springboards for Diamond's still-potent voice; and 'Seongah and Jimmy' is an eyewitness account of a romance between a woman from Korea and a man from Long Island.\" The Wall Street Journal wrote that \"The Art of Love\" is a \"tender offering from Diamond, who at age 73, hasn't lost that ability to convey a wide swath of emotions in just four minutes.\" In September, three videos from the album were released. A lyric video for \"The Art of Love\" debuted on Diamond's YouTube/VEVO channel, and the video for the album's first single, \"Something Blue\", premiered on Yahoo! Music. Rolling Stone debuted the video for \"Nothing But a Heartache\". In October 2014, Melody Road debuted at number 3 on the Billboard charts, and at number 4 in the UK. The album received generally favorable reviews. Ann Powers of NPR wrote: \"This is music with (as one song title says) a sunny disposition, expressing Diamond's resilient faith in the power of both romance and the balladry that enhances it. 'Still remember the first word you wrote, in every single note that you play,' he declares in \"First Time,\" a joyful remembrance of musical beginnings that recalls one of the singer's own early hits, \"I'm a Believer.\" Diamond's ability to do that, to be in the moment while knowing just what makes his long career special, keeps him vital. Few could navigate this road with so much panache.\""@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"The Lover in Me is the tenth studio album by Scottish singer, Sheena Easton. It was released in November 1988 and was her debut for MCA. The album reached #44 on the Billboard 200 and #30 in the UK, and was certified Gold by the RIAA. This is one of Easton's best selling albums to date and returned her to the U.S. and UK charts. Significantly, in the UK it was her first charting album for over five years, with the lead single becoming her first top 20 hit in nearly eight years. The album's title track became a major hit, reaching #2 on the Billboard Hot 100, #5 on Billboard's Hot Black Singles chart, and #15 on the UK Singles Chart. Other singles from the album include \"Days Like This\" (#35 on the US R&B chart, UK #43) and \"101\" (UK #54 US Dance #2). \"101\" was written for Easton by Prince. One last single was released in the US; \"No Deposit, No Return\", but failed to chart. The song \"Follow My Rainbow\" is featured in an episode (Deliver Us From Evil) from Miami Vice in which Easton's character is singing the song minutes before her character is eliminated. The song made #16 on the Dutch and New Zealand singles chart. The album has a more Urban/R&B sound than Easton's previous recordings due to the production by well-known acts such as L.A. Reid, Babyface and John Jellybean Benitez. In 2006, Cherry Red Records (UK) re-released The Lover in Me, remastered and with added bonus tracks."@en ;

Manilow wrote in the liner notes that the record's concept came to him in a dream. Johnny Mercer's widow, Ginger, entrusted Manilow with a cache of Mercer's lyrics that had never been set to music. Although Manilow used only Mercer's \"When October Goes\" for the project, he created an album of all original songs with a torchy, smokey jazz style. He recruited veteran jazz musicians Bill Mays, Gerry Mulligan, Shelly Manne, Mundell Lowe, and George Duvivier. Also enlisted for vocal duets were Mel Torm\u00E9 and Sarah Vaughan. The entire album was rehearsed for three days, then recorded entirely live (in one take) without overdubs at Westlake Studio 'C' in Los Angeles, California and released in 1984.

The storyline for the album was first revealed on Cooper's radio show Nights with Alice Cooper. The theme of the album revolves around a \"cool, calm and collected\" serial killer known as Spider. The police are baffled by the bodies of Spider's victims, which are cocooned in a silk web, and are each missing a leg. Spider's task is to collect eight legs in order to complete the construction of his own spider. However, things get complicated when he falls in love with his eighth victim. Along Came a Spider was due for a 2007 release but problems with producer scheduling and tour commitments caused it to be pushed to mid-2008. Several demos and songs were prepared and short-listed during 2007 with further sessions for recording and writing took place in February 2008. 75% of the album had been completed as of April 18, 2008.

It had been recorded at the band's performance on 8 May 1993 at the Barker Hangar at Santa Monica Airport in Southern California. INXS performed to a crowd of nearly 4,000; the concert had sold out in less than three minutes. Radio network, Westwood One, broadcast the live gig. The music video for \"Time\", the group's third single from Full Moon, Dirty Hearts (November 1993), includes footage shot at the venue. The four B-side tracks from \"Time\" (maxi-single version) are from the same concert and appear on INXS: Live at Barker Hangar. The group had undertaken the Australian leg of their Get out of the House Tour starting on 10 April 1993 with concerts in Perth followed by Sydney, Adelaide, Melbourne and Brisbane. That leg finished in early May and they travelled to San Francisco to commence their North American leg. The show at Barker Hangar was their second, they continued with gigs in Dallas, Chicago, Detroit, Toronto, Montreal, Boston, New York, Philadelphia and Atlanta. The group's European leg was from late May to the end of June. Mark West of Strange Tales described the tour as \"a back-to-basics affair, stripping everything down and benefitting greatly from a marketing campaign that played on it being a return to the \u2018pub tours\u2019 of old\", they deliberately chose to perform \"gigs in towns they\u2019d never played before and in venues that were much smaller than they were used to\". In 2005 four different digital service providers offered the full album along with exclusive bonus material: iTunes, MSN, Yahoo!, and Real Rhapsody; each offered an additional exclusive track from the encore of the show which were \"Time\", \"Bitter Tears\", \"Mystify\" and \"Don't Change\", respectively. At the band's request, a local cover band, Dread Zeppelin, opened the show and performed tracks from that group's third album, Hot & Spicy Beanburger (1993)."@en ;

Brown began working on the album after being discovered by the production team Trackmasters and appearing on a number of singles by other artists, such as LL Cool J, Case and Jay Z. The immediate success of the singles led to a bidding war at the beginning of 1996, and in March, Def Jam Recordings won and signed the then 17-year-old rapper to the label. Mostly produced by Trackmasters, Ill Na Na features guest appearances from Blackstreet, Havoc, Method Man, Kid Capri and Jay Z. Lyrically, the album mainly focuses on themes of fashion, sex and mafia. Released exactly one week after Lil' Kim's debut album Hard Core, the album received generally positive reviews from music critics, heavily comparing the two albums. Ill Na Na debuted at number seven on the Billboard 200 with 109,000 copies sold in its first week.

dbr:In_Your_Honor	rdf:type	schema:MusicAlbum ;
	dbo:abstract	"In Your Honor, released in the United Kingdom as In Your Honour, is the fifth studio album by American alternative rock band Foo Fighters, released on June 14, 2005 by RCA Records. It is a double album, with one disc containing heavy rock songs and a second disc with mellower acoustic songs. Frontman Dave Grohl decided to do a diverse blend of songs as he felt that after ten years of existence, the band had to break new ground with their music. The album was recorded at a newly built studio in Northridge, Los Angeles, and featured guests such as John Paul Jones, Norah Jones and Josh Homme. The lyrics deal with both resonating and introspective themes, with a major influence from Grohl's involvement on the campaign trail with John Kerry during the 2004 presidential election. The promotional tour for the album included both rock shows in stadiums and acoustic gigs in smaller venues. Reviews for In Your Honor were mostly positive, praising the composition and sound, although some critics found the album overlong and inconsistent. The album was also nominated for five Grammy Awards, and topped the charts in five countries\u2014including Australia\u2014and reached the top five in five more, including number two in both the United States and the United Kingdom. In Your Honor also broke the band's consecutive streak of Grammy Award for Best Rock Album wins that began in 1999 with There Is Nothing Left to Lose."@en ;

The album was released in September 2006 on Last Gang Records. It debuted at 28 in Canada and has sold 20,000 copies there. She has stated that Metric is still her first priority. The album is a collection of piano-driven songs backed with soft strings and horns and is said to feature guest spots by Sparklehorse's Scott Minor, members of Stars, Broken Social Scene and Metric. She is quoted as saying the following: \"When I was a little kid\u2026I would creep downstairs to the piano and write rudimentary songs about imaginary places. I'm told the first song I ever wrote was a love song to a cranberry tree. I always used the mute pedal. I hated the idea of anybody hearing me. Everywhere I've lived while working with Metric, I've written songs on the piano and played them for no one. On the advice of a friend, I decided I'd better start recording them before they were forgotten. Four meandering years later I ended up with this collection of songs featuring a few of my favorite people, a group I call The Soft Skeleton.\" The album's art is based on that of Escalator over the Hill, Haines' late father Paul Haines' album with Carla Bley. The song \"Doctor Blind\" was rated #457 on Pitchfork Media's Top 500 Tracks of the 2000s."@en ;

On all shows of the Across the Night tour, the concert was divided into two sets, which were introduced on the three large video screens above the stage as \"Act 1\" and \"Act 2\"; the respective CDs and DVDs in the album are labelled in the same manner. \"Act 1\", which showcased mainly quieter and more experimental material, was \"dominated\" by songs from the band's then-latest studio album, Diorama, and was marked by \"grand orchestrated sections (replicated by two extra keyboards); dramatic flourishes, both vocally and instrumentally; [and] an almost parodic leap into prog rock's 'look at me, look at me' shifts of form and time.\" \"Act 2\", which consisted of heavier rock songs, saw the band \"revert to more of a hard rock set-up, with the cabaret touches junked for less subtle, but brutally effective delivery.\" The album spent three weeks on the Australian ARIA Charts, peaking at #13.

It was filmed at the Palais Omnisports de Paris-Bercy concert hall in Paris, France, where Shakira performed on 13 and 14 June 2011, as part of the European leg of The Sun Comes Out World Tour. Live from Paris was released in a DVD and live audio CD format, a standard DVD format, and as a Blu-ray Disc edition. It was released in most countries on 2 December 2011, while in the United States it was released on 5 December. Prior to its release, Live from Paris was screened in various cinemas across the world and was also promoted through Shakira's official website, which posted numerous trailers and previews of the album. Shakira's rendition of French singer-songwriter Francis Cabrel's song \"Je L'Aime \u00E0 Mourir\", which she specifically performed during the concert shows at Paris, was released as a single on 29 November 2011. Upon its release, Live from Paris received generally favourable reviews from critics, who praised it as a showcase of Shakira's versatility. One reviewer, however, criticised the singer for putting less emphasis on vocals and more on the dance routines. Commercially, the album performed well on the charts of France and Mexico, where it was later certified platinum by the Syndicat National de l'\u00C9dition Phonographique (SNEP) and Asociaci\u00F3n Mexicana de Productores de Fonogramas y Videogramas (AMPROFON), respectively.

During October 2013, Charlie went on a tour of the UK supporting rock band, Deaf Havana. He previewed two new tracks from the forthcoming album \"Winter Hymns\" and \"Ten More Days\". In 2014, he be undertook a small run of solo shows in the UK in the lead up to the release of his 2nd solo album. Simpson said when announcing the release: \"The making of this album has been an incredible journey for me, it is probably the hardest record I have ever had to make. It took me a while to find what I was looking for and there were points when I nearly had to go back to the drawing board.

	dbo:abstract	"Mensch, released in 2002, is the 20th music release by prominent German rock/pop artist Herbert Gr\u00F6nemeyer. Mensch (\"Human\") is Gr\u00F6nemeyer's 11th full-length album of original compositions. The title track \"Mensch\" became Gr\u00F6nemeyer's first number-one single in Germany. The mood of the album reflects the recent death of his wife and one of his older brothers in the same week, and is rich with poetic imagery. The songs range from rock to ballads. The richness of the imagery and language, as well as the use of creative word play, can make the lyrics difficult to interpret by listeners who are not fluent in German. In Mensch Gr\u00F6nemeyer reflects on his own humanity as it relates to feeling loss. The song \"Der Weg\" in particular focuses on memories of his wife and the love they shared. The full-length album was released in three versions: The compact disc and the Super Audio CD (CD layer and high-resolution SACD stereo sections) contain a hidden track after about fifteen minutes of silence at the end of the last song.

It was recorded in Hamburg, Germany upon KMFDM's return from their first visit to America and subsequent tour with Ministry. It was also the first record that they released after signing directly to Wax Trax! Records. The album was out of print for over a decade due to copyright infringement: the seventh track, \"Liebeslied\", used unauthorized samples from a recording of \"O Fortuna\", from Carl Orff's 1930s cantata Carmina Burana. The album was recalled approximately three years after being released. Copies today are rare and considered collector's items. In addition to this, \"Godlike\" samples \"Angel of Death\" by Slayer and \"Go To Hell\" uses the same riff as Metallica's \"Metal Militia\", although re-performed (and possibly just a coincidence given how simple the riff is). All of the tracks on the album, except for the original mixes of \"Die Now-Live Later\", \"Liebeslied\" and \"Go to Hell\" were subsequently available on other discs. The album was re-released as Na\u00EFve/Hell to Go, with some songs remixed, in 1994. A digitally remastered reissue of Na\u00EFve was released on November 21, 2006, along with Money and Angst. It was reissued with an edited version of the track \"Liebeslied\" without the offending sample. It also features the remixes that initially appeared on Na\u00EFve/Hell to Go."@en ;

She noted of its lyrics that Collette's \"bitterness runs cold and constant even beneath songs that, sonically, express a kind of genial largesse, a contradiction that is this record's most brilliant aspect\". The Sydney Morning Herald described it as \"a warm, lush record bursting (quietly) with a clutch of songs that dip and dive like springtime swallows, as intricate as they are robust ...

	dbo:abstract	"Parisienne Walkways was written by Moore & Lynott; see the extensive research at SongFacts. One Night in Dublin: A Tribute to Phil Lynott is a live DVD by Gary Moore credited to \"Gary Moore and Friends\". On the night of 20 August 2005, Gary Moore (Thin Lizzy guitarist 1974, 1977, 1978\u20131979) staged a concert at the Point Theatre in Dublin, Ireland. It featured Brian Downey and ex-Thin Lizzy guitarists Brian Robertson and Eric Bell as well as ongoing Lizzy member Scott Gorham. The concert was simply called \"The Boy Is Back in Town\", with the \"One Night in Dublin\" title a change made for the DVD. On 21 April 2009 it was also released on Blu-ray format. The show was typical in several ways of both Thin Lizzy shows and Gary Moore ones. As always with Thin Lizzy, \"Cowboy Song\" was followed by \"The Boys Are Back in Town\", and \"Whisky in the Jar\" is part of the encore. When Moore recorded \"Don't Believe a Word\" as a solo artist he played the song in its original slow blues arrangement; here he begins performing his version before switching mid-song to the faster Thin Lizzy-style rock song. As is always so with Moore, he closed with \"Parisienne Walkways\". Robertson, Gorham and Bell only performed songs they originally performed with Thin Lizzy. The DVD also contains the unveiling of a statue of Phil Lynott in Grafton Street, Dublin earlier that day, and rehearsals and interviews with Thin Lizzy members who featured in this concert."@en ;

The problem was playlist controllers who thought that ambiguous lyrics might be expounded to be a reference to smoking marijuana. As a result, the single flopped to reach the UK Top 50. In order to promote Pass It Around, Smokie extensively tour Britain starting on 24 April 1975 as support act to Pilot, who scored a UK #1 hit with \"January\".

However, the box set was not a high seller, and near the end of the 1990s, it ranked as Yankovic's least-purchased album. In 2006, due to a mishap by Volcano Records, the artwork for the set was lost, and the collection went out of print.

dbr:Persecution_Mania	rdf:type	schema:MusicAlbum ;
	dbo:abstract	"Persecution Mania is the second studio album by German thrash metal band Sodom, released on 1 December 1987 by Steamhammer/SPV. The album marked a drastic change of sound from black metal to thrash metal. As well as defining Sodom's sound, it exemplified the thrash metal genre at a time when it arguably peaked in popularity. The album also bore similarity to the music of other German bands such as Destruction and Kreator, and the term \"Teutonic\" thrash was coined from this. Despite what the cover may imply, the lyrical themes of the album are centred more around politics and war than religion. This is largely due to guitarist Frank \"Blackfire\" Godznik joining the band. He brought new songwriting aspects to the band that gave it a much more organized and clearer sound, as well as helping Sodom to carve a lyrical niche that it still practices to this day. The outro guitar lead in track 9, \"Bombenhagel\", is the German national anthem, \"Das Lied der Deutschen\". Persecution Mania was re-released in 2000 as part of a double pack with the Obsessed by Cruelty/In the Sign of Evil split. Both CD releases include the Expurse of Sodomy EP."@en ;

It's the first album to feature Lonnie Chapin on bass, who would become the band's full-time bassist until 2001. The music is a mixture of traditional and original praise songs with a rock style. It is considered to be more diverse musically than the band's first, straight forward hard rock, praise album. Most of the original songs were penned by band founder Bob Hartman (except \"Song of Moses\" that was written by former keyboardist Jim Cooper and well-known musician Brian Wooten).

	dbo:abstract	"Stabbing the Drama is the sixth full-length studio album released by Swedish metal band Soilwork. The record was released on February 28, 2005 via Nuclear Blast label. For a time this was the last to feature long-time guitarist Peter Wichers, who left the band after the subsequent tour until rejoining in 2008. Style-wise, this could be considered a more diverse album than the previous record, Figure Number Five, taking elements of the past and present, and potential future. Most of the songwriting is done by guitarist Peter Wichers, and the central musical theme contains a simpler sound than heard on prior albums, with a reduction of harmonic guitar leads and a more metalcore-centric approach, such as usage of stop-start rhythm guitar work and breakdowns. This is also the first album to feature new drummer Dirk Verbeuren, who brings a more technical approach to the band's drumming compared to the previous two albums. Some pressings of the CD have tracks three and four reversed, with parts of track three still at the start of track four. Various pressings of the CD also mislabeled the final track, \"If Possible\", to the 12th Bonus Track \"Wherever Thorns May Grow\" which is only featured on the US and European limited digipak edition, respective the Japanese and Korean pressings. 1,000 copies were made in a limited collectors metal case in the shape of the Soilworker's logo. Threat Signal did a cover version of the song \"Stabbing the Drama\" along with Speed, Live. Some copies of Stabbing the Drama were mastered using HDCD. Although it is unmarked, playing the album in a CD player able to decode HDCD will give superior sound quality."@en ;

In the liner notes to Screeching Weasel's Thank You Very Little (2000), Ben Weasel refers to Storm the Streets as a \"gem\" but admits that the record sold far less than its predecessor, Riverdales (1995). The band broke up with the album's release. \"I Accuse My Parents\" most likely takes its title from a movie of the same name which was featured on Mystery Science Theater 3000, a television show mentioned in the song \"I Think About You During the Commercials\" from the Riverdales' debut album.Storm the Streets is being remastered and reissued in 2011 on Fat Wreck Chords but no further details are currently known. The album was mixed from February 24-27, 1997 by Mass Giorgini at Sonic Iguana Studios in Lafayette, Indiana."@en ;

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sublime_(album)>	rdf:type	schema:MusicAlbum ;
	dbo:abstract	"Sublime is the eponymous third and final studio album by American ska punk band Sublime. Produced by Paul Leary and David Kahne, the album was released on July 30, 1996 in the United States by MCA Records. Sublime formed in 1988 in Long Beach, California by vocalist/guitarist Bradley Nowell, bassist Eric Wilson, and drummer Bud Gaugh. The trio toured heavily from their inception while developing their sound. Their first studio release \u2014 40 Oz. to Freedom (1992) \u2014 featured the single \"Date Rape\", which attracted heavy airplay in Southern California. MCA signed the band and distributed their second independent album, Robbin' the Hood, in 1994. By the time it came to record their major label debut, Nowell had been struggling with a heroin addiction. Sublime was recorded over a period of three months in Austin, Texas, in sessions characterized by heavy drug use and raucous partying. The album's musical style contains elements of punk rock, reggae, and ska, as well as dancehall, hip hop, and dub music, with tempos ranging wildly. Nowell's lyrical subject matter relates to relationships, prostitution, riots, and addiction. Nowell had been ejected from the recording near its completion, and was found dead of a heroin overdose in May 1996, two months prior to its release, leading to the band's dissolution. Bolstered by numerous hit singles, among them \"What I Got\", \"Santeria\", and \"Wrong Way\", the record proved enormously successful, despite the lack of an active band to promote it. It sold over five million copies in the United States by the end of the decade, and it continues to be a popular catalog album. The album ushered in third wave ska, and etched Sublime into a permanent place among the stars of 1990s alternative rock. Critical reviews were kind, praising Nowell's songwriting ability and the album's musical variety. Sublime has since been listed as one of the most well-regarded albums of the 1990s by Spin and Rolling Stone."@en ;

dbr:The_Pleasures_of_Electricity	rdf:type	schema:MusicAlbum ;
	dbo:abstract	"The Pleasures of Electricity is an album by John Foxx and Louis Gordon, released in 2001. It was the duo's second studio album, and Foxx's third after his return to the music scene in 1997. The album continues along the lines of modern electronics flavoured with early-80s touches, that was set out by the duo's 1997 album Shifting City. However, The Pleasures of Electricity is more polished and minimalist than any of Foxx's previous albums (solo or in a group), to the extent that the album sounds almost sterile in places. The lyrics recall themes similar to those in Foxx's classic album Metamatic, dealing with traveling and urban life, including almost bizarre lyrics comparing driving in a car to mathematics in \"Automobile\" (all this delivered in Foxx's most deadpan voice). \"Invisible Women\" is a track Foxx originally recorded with Nation 12 over a decade earlier (the version here includes a synth riff recycled from Foxx's single \"Underpass\" that wasn't included in the Nation 12 version), while \"Cities of Light 5\" is a further development of \"Cities of Light 1\" that was also recorded with Nation 12. The album\u2019s original press release states: \u201CTaking a cue from Kraftwerk, one of Foxx\u2019s most obvious stylistic touchstones, \u201CPleasures\u2026\u201D is a streamlined monorail of lock-step computer-generated beats and wiry synthesizer melodies with an equal emphasis on dark, atmospherics and energised, danceable rhythms.\u201D The artwork of the album was designed by Foxx himself, based on his own photography. The main cover depicts a man in a grey suit standing next to a door, his face completely whited out by a bright light that seems to originate from inside him. This, together with the album name, recalled Ren\u00E9 Magritte's painting Le Principe Du Plaisir, and through it Gary Numan's synthpop classic The Pleasure Principle, the artwork and title of which were inspired by the said painting (sonically The Pleasures of Electricity also resembles The Pleasure Principle and vice versa). In the sleeve notes for the live album The Golden Section Tour + The Omnidelic Exotour Foxx writes of buying a grey suit around 1978 and photographing his friends wearing it, with the face of the person never showing in the pictures. Whether or not the photographs used on The Pleasures of Electricity are from this time is unknown, but based on the description the artwork for this album is similar to Foxx's 1978 photography. No singles were released from the album, however \"Nightlife\" was included on the Modern Art compilation released some three months before The Pleasures of Electricity. A 2 CD remastered special edition was released in October 2009. Four tracks on CD 1 featured on the original album were significantly remixed - 'Nightlife', 'Invisible Women', 'Cities of Light 5' and 'Automobile'. Although they feature new sounds and in some cases additional arrangements, they were remixed in the context of the album, and therefore not just added as 'extras' to the package. Disc Two features the original mix of the album plus two previously unreleased bonus tracks 'Screenplay' and 'Twilight Room', thus making it the 'definitive edition' of this album."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"The Return of Dr. Octagon is the tenth studio album by American rapper Keith Thornton, better known as Kool Keith. Released in the United States on June 27, 2006, it is his second studio album under the Dr. Octagon alias, following Dr. Octagonecologyst. The album revives the character of Dr. Octagon, who was killed off on Thornton's 1999 release First Come, First Served. Production for the album began in 2002 under the title The Resurrection of Dr. Octagon with producer Fanatik J. Thornton signed a contract with CMH Records to release the album. Following a contractual dispute, Fanatik J was released from the project. The album's production was completed by the One-Watt Sun production team based upon three completed vocal recordings and older unfinished recordings. Thornton had little involvement with the production of the album. He later stated that he liked the completed product, but that it hurt his musical reputation. The Return of Dr. Octagon initially received great reviews. The first single Aliens garnered the coveted Guardian Single of the Week in the U.K., and also was given a place among Wire Magazines top Hip Hop records of the year, but what followed were much more polarized reviews. The album did not chart. Much praise and criticism centered on the production, with HipHop Dx stating \"This is Kool Keith's best album in years--arguably even better than his classic Octagonecologyst,\" and Newsweek stating that \"If this album surpasses its predecessor, full credit goes to the Berlin production trio One Watt Sun, who come off sounding like a cross between Parliament-Funkadelic and Kraftwerk.\" Yet others felt that the production fit neither Thornton's lyrical style nor the Dr. Octagon character."@en ;

Thirteen is the first Megadeth studio album since The World Needs a Hero (2001) to feature bassist and founding member David Ellefson, who returned to the band in 2010. Thirteen debuted at number 11 on the Billboard 200 chart, selling 42,000 copies in its first week. The album broke into the top 20 in several other markets as well. It has sold about 120,000 copies in the United States as of December 2012. The album has received largely positive reviews from critics. The album followed the successful Endgame, released two years previously, and was recorded in late spring 2011. In addition to new material was written for the album, the band decided to rework and release several older songs, some of which had previously seen release as demos or bonus tracks. Additionally, several of the songs on the album were intended to appear on video game soundtracks, notably \"Sudden Death\", which appeared as a playable song in the 2010 video game Guitar Hero: Warriors of Rock. The lead single from Thirteen was the Al Capone-inspired \"Public Enemy No. 1\". This was followed by \"Whose Life (Is It Anyways?)\" about a month later. \"Sudden Death\" was released as a single prior to the announcement of Thirteen to promote Guitar Hero: Warriors of Rock, but was later included on the album.

	dbo:abstract	"Unbroken is the third studio album by American singer Demi Lovato. It was released on September 20, 2011, by Hollywood Records. Lovato described the album as \"more mature\" and \"a little more R&B/pop\" than her previous material, citing Rihanna as the major influence. While some of the album's lyrical content was heavily influenced by Lovato's personal struggles, it also deals with lighter subjects, such as love, self empowerment, and having fun. The album received generally mixed to mostly positive reviews from music critics, with some who commended its ballad tracks and praised Lovato's vocals, but others who dismissed it as \"immature\" and criticized its amount of \"party songs\". Commercially, the album peaked at number four on the Billboard 200, with sales exceeding 97,000 copies in its first week of release. It was eventually certified Gold. Unbroken performed well internationally worldwide, and peaked in the top 40 in many countries including, Australia, Canada, Italy, Mexico, New Zealand, Spain and Switzerland. It was certified Platinum in Brazil, and Gold in Chile and the Philippines. The lead single \"Skyscraper\" was released on July 12, 2011. The song was a commercial success and peaked number ten on the Billboard Hot 100, making it Lovato's second highest-charting single to date, behind \"This Is Me\" and her most successful until \"Heart Attack\" cracked the Top 10. It also reached the top twenty in Canada, New Zealand and Scotland and sold over 1,000,000 copies in the United States, where it was certified platinum. The song was well received from music critics, who generally cited as a highlight on the album. \"Give Your Heart a Break\" was released as the second and final single from the album on January 23, 2012."@en ;

dbr:Until_the_Quiet_Comes	rdf:type	schema:MusicAlbum ;
	dbo:abstract	"Until the Quiet Comes is the fourth studio album by American electronic producer Flying Lotus, released on September 26, 2012, by Warp Records. After releasing his 2010 album Cosmogramma, Flying Lotus continued his creative partnership with bassist Thundercat and worked with him on music that led to the album. For Until the Quiet Comes, he drew on African percussion and psychedelic musical influences, human-subconscious and dream world concepts, and different mixing techniques and dynamics. He recorded for two years at his home in Los Angeles primarily using an Ableton Live sequencer along with other instruments and software, and recorded with guest vocalists including Erykah Badu, Thom Yorke, Laura Darlington, and Niki Randa. An electronic jazz album, Until the Quiet Comes features free jazz elements, varying musical tones, contracting scale, and shifts in feel. Its songs are sequenced together and characterized by ghostly vocal production, irregular drum beats, pulsating percussive textures, trembling basslines, trilled synthesizers, and fluctuating samples. The album has a journey-like concept and dreamy musical narrative, which Flying Lotus conceived through astral projection and felt could be interpreted uniquely by listeners. Music writers interpret it as a musical accompaniment to dreams, as well as emotional introspection by Flying Lotus. Until the Quiet Comes was promoted with two singles and a short film featuring music from the album. Flying Lotus also embarked on a supporting international tour during October to November 2012, performing at venues in North America and abroad. The album debuted at number 34 on the US Billboard 200 and sold 13,000 copies in its first week. Until the Quiet Comes received rave reviews from music critics, who praised its complex music and Flying Lotus' sound engineering."@en ;

The album is Simpson's first effort following her divorce from Nick Lachey in early 2006. The album was produced by Jimmy Jam & Terry Lewis, Cory Rooney, Scott Storch, Stargate and Lester Mendez. Simpson appears as a co-writer of nine of the thirteen songs on the album. A Public Affair received generally mixed reviews from music critics, who complimented its musical diversity from Simpson's previous albums, while also criticizing its length. The album debuted at #5 on the US Billboard 200 with first-week sales of 101,000 copies. A Public Affair has sold 500,000 units in the US and 1,000,000 copies worldwide to date. It is the last pop album Simpson released before switching to country music. Three singles were released from the record, the lead single, \"A Public Affair\" was the album's most successful single, became Simpson's sixth top-twenty single in the US and her third song to reach number 14 tied with \"With You\" (2004) and \"These Boots Are Made for Walkin'\" (2005). The next single, \"I Belong to Me\", failed to chart on the Billboard Hot 100. The third single \"You Spin Me Round (Like a Record)\" was released as a promo single. Her version of the song barely made the Pop 100, and failed to make the Billboard Hot 100 chart, however, it charted to no. 20 on the Bubbling Under Hot 100, which is equivalent to no. 120. Simpson's version has new lyrics and only preserves the chorus of the song. The UK version was released on February 12, 2007 and included the video for \"A Public Affair\" and the audio for \"These Boots Are Made for Walkin'\" as UK bonus tracks."@en ;

After touring their critically acclaimed debut album Venus in Tweeds (1994), the band began work on the new album in late 1995 and premiered some of its tracks live in early 1996 ahead of its release. The album presents a unique, off-kilter sound that combines the band's Scottish Celtic music with genres such as worldbeat and techno. The band described the album as \"acid croft\", whilst one reviewer termed it a unique variation of Celtic rock. After a short delay, the album was released in May 1996 by Greentrax Recordings. The album was critically acclaimed, with critics praising its unique and innovative sound. It has since gone on to be regarded as a groundbreaking album. Nonetheless, the album was released to an \"unsuspecting public\" with minimal promotion, and as such, the band retained their loyal cult following. The band toured the album in 1996, leading to the live album Live at Selwyn Hall."@en ;

Production was handled by several record producers, including Kannon \"Caviar\" Cross, Just Blaze, Mannie Fresh, Lil' C, Wyclef Jean, Jerry 'Wonder' Duplessis, Sedeck \"All Hands on Deck\" Jean, Keith \"Lil' Wonda\" Duplessis, Kevin \"Khao\" Cates, Bao Quoc Pham, Steve Holdren, Nate \"Danja\" Hills, The Runners, Tony Galvin, Eminem, Jeff Bass, and Keith Mack, among others.

The Recording Industry Association of America certified the album Platinum. Upon its release, T.I. vs. T.I.P. received generally very mixed reviews from music critics.

T.I. vs. T.I.P. was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Rap Album, losing to Kanye West's Graduation at the 50th Annual Grammy Awards The album won the American Music Award for Favorite Rap/Hip-Hop Album at The American Music Awards of 2007.

Holder was asked the meaning behind the title upon release, he stated \"I was reading the sports pages one day and there was an article on motor sport. It talked about the 'kamikaze complex' those guys who compete seem to have in putting their life on the line every time they go on the track. I think Barry Sheene was mentioned as a specific example.

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Abominations_(album)>	rdf:type	schema:MusicAlbum ;
	dbo:abstract	"Abominations is the third and final studio album by Seattle horror punk band Schoolyard Heroes. The album was recorded in January 2007 over the course of 18 days, and released on September 17 of the same year. After signing to Stolen Transmission, the album served as the band's major label debut and their first album not to be released independently through The Control Group. The production of the album was handled entirely by John Goodmanson with the majority of the lyrics composed by the band's singer and frontwoman Ryann Donnelly. Donnelly serves as the main singer on the album, with bassist Jonah Bergman performing backing vocals. Envisioned as an album about falling inlove during the apocalypse, the album was inspired by horror films, with the lyrics composed from themes such as death and tragedy. The album presents its themes in a theatrical, over-the-top and often campy style. It was promoted by two singles; lead single \"Dude, Where's My Skin?\" and \"The Plastic Surgery Hall of Fame\". Both songs received music videos directed by Brian and Brad Palmer. In early 2008, the band completed a nationwide tour, opening for the Seattle-based band Aiden. The album received positive reviews from music critics, who praised Donnelly's singing, the often melodic composition, and the morbid themes expressed on the project. While a critical success, the album failed to achieve any chart positions. The album generated some controversy from concerned individuals who accused the album of promoting satanism and murder. The band announced their breakup on November 20, 2009, which meant that Abominations was their last album together as a group."@en ;

It was released by EMI CMG, Grant's new record label, to mark the start of her contract with them. It does not contain new songs, but the record label did remaster all of her songs.

As with The Collection, the songs are arranged in reverse chronological order. There is a special edition of the album that contains a bonus DVD as well. Notably missing from the collection are several of Grant's hits, including the early CCM classic \"All I Ever Have to Be\", \"Everywhere I Go\", \"Wise Up\", \"The Next Time I Fall\" (a duet with Peter Cetera), and her cover version of Joni Mitchell's \"Big Yellow Taxi\"."@en ;

The 2-CD set was released on November 20, 2007. For the next game in the Halo trilogy, O'Donnell added new themes as well as bringing back and expanding old ones, some of which had never been recorded with a full orchestra before. The score made extensive use of the piano, an instrument which O'Donnell used frequently for composition but that had not been featured in previous Halo music. In addition to scoring the game, the music was used for promotional advertisements and trailers preceding Halo 3's release. The game's score and its soundtrack were generally well received. The soundtrack reached the Billboard 200 chart, and also broke the top twenty best-selling soundtracks and independent albums listings. The score was nominated for X-Play's \"Best of 2007\" awards, under best original soundtrack."@en ;

dbr:No_Line_on_the_Horizon	rdf:type	schema:MusicAlbum ;
	dbo:abstract	"No Line on the Horizon is the twelfth studio album by rock band U2. It was produced by Brian Eno, Daniel Lanois, and Steve Lillywhite, and was released on 27 February 2009. It was the band's first record since How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb (2004), marking the longest gap between studio albums of their career to that point. The band originally intended to release the songs as two EPs, but later combined the material into a single record. Photographer Anton Corbijn shot a companion film, Linear, which was released alongside the album and included with several special editions. U2 began work on the album in 2006 with record producer Rick Rubin but shelved most of the material from those sessions. In May 2007, the group began new sessions with Eno and Lanois in Fez, Morocco. Intending to write \"future hymns\"\u2014songs that would be played forever\u2014the group spent two weeks recording in a riad and involved the producers in the songwriting process. Having grown tired of writing in the first-person, lead singer Bono wrote his lyrics from the perspective of different characters. Recording continued at several studios in the United States, United Kingdom, and Ireland through December 2008. The group had intended to release No Line on the Horizon in November, but after composing 50 to 60 songs, they delayed the release to continue writing. Prior to the album's release, U2 indicated that Eno's and Lanois' involvement, as well as the band's time in Fez, had resulted in a more experimental record than their previous two albums. The band compared the shift in style to that seen between The Joshua Tree (1987) and Achtung Baby (1991). Upon its release, No Line on the Horizon received generally favourable reviews, although many critics noted that it was not as experimental as previously suggested. The album debuted at number one in 30 countries but did not sell as well as anticipated; the band expressed disappointment over the relatively low sales, compared to previous albums, of five million copies. By contrast, the supporting U2 360\u00B0 Tour from 2009 to 2011, was the highest-grossing concert tour in history, with ticket sales over $736 million."@en ;

The soundtrack is predominantly instrumental with a few traditional holiday songs performed with a darker medieval flair. The music is accented with Gregorian chanting, pipe organs, violins, and acoustic guitar. Some of the tracks contain vocals, such as the minstrel's rendition of \"Past Time With Good Company\". Other songs feature narration describing a tale of a ghostly knight who wanders the ruins of a haunted cathedral at wintertime. The story is set in the mythical Ebonshire forest. The booklet is decorated to look like an Illuminated manuscript and features the artwork of Joseph Vargo. Nox Arcana, already popular in the gothic music genre, wanted to carry the gothic mood into the Christmas season, along the lines of Dickens' classic ghost story, A Christmas Carol."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Addicted to Bad Ideas is the fifth album by The World/Inferno Friendship Society, and their second for Chunksaah Records. Subtitled \"Peter Lorre's Twentieth Century\", the release is a concept album inspired by the life and films of actor Peter Lorre. Lead singer Jack Terricloth describes Lorre as \"a strangely charismatic, extremely creepy person, which I think most punk rockers can identify with ... It\u2019s the lure of the other. He\u2019s the underdog, the outsider.\" Many of the album's lyrics are taken directly from movie dialogues, notable Lorre quotes, and from the biography The Lost One: A Life of Peter Lorre by Stephen D. Youngkin. The track title, \"Everybody Comes to Rick's\" is a reference to \"Rick's Caf\u00E9 Am\u00E9ricain\" from the film Casablanca. In addition, the album's cover art is an homage to Lorre's renowned film M. This album was developed into a dramatic multimedia production directed by Jay Scheib. In 2009 World Inferno performed this work at festivals such as Public Theater's Under the Radar Festival, Philadelphia's Live Arts Festival, Montclair State University's Peak Performances series, and South Carolina's Spoleto Festival USA. Jack Terricloth commented, \"the producer asked me if we were ever going to pay him back. We said 'No!'\" The songs \"Peter Lorre\" and \"Heart Attack '64\" are reworked versions of tracks from Just the Best Party, and \"Ich erinnere mich an die Weimarer Republik\" is reworked from East Coast Super Sound Punk of Today."@en ;

The first album to feature bass guitarist Tobias Schick. This album is highly typical of Fleshcrawl's mid-to-late career material, and resembles contemporary work by such melodic/Swedish death metal bands as Dismember, Entombed, and Arch Enemy. It utilizes highly melodic and aerobically rhythmic mid-to-high guitar range with rapid tempos and short, highly agile guitar solos, and is consequently very characteristic of the Swedish-style Death metal sound that has dominated their work since the late 1990s. A slightly brutal sound present in the drumwork, which consists of very high-tempo double-bass drum rolls and the occasional blast beats, serves to accent the melodic death metal rhythmics of the album without creating a sense of disorganization and chaos, while the guttural, abrasive vocals, somewhat reminiscent of such bands as Six Feet Under and Deicide enhance the intensity of the album."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Descend Into The Absurd is the first studio album by the German death metal band Fleshcrawl. It was the only Fleshcrawl album on which guitarist Giro Schmidt appeared. Unlike later albums, Descend Into The Absurd has minor black metal and doom metal elements to it, particularly in the guitar work, which is often less rhythmic and melodic than their later, Swedish-style death metal. The guitar melodies and tones often alternate somewhat abruptly between low, intense rhythms and high-beat, rapid progressions and the solowork has a very slight bluesy feel to it. The drumwork is typical of early Fleshcrawl, consisting of rapid double-bass drum rolls, heavy blast beats, and a somewhat \"tinny\" sound that, combined with their both searing mid-range and guttural low-range vocals makes their early sound unique."@en ;

A revised version of the album was released by Absolutely Kosher Records in the USA on October 24, 2006. The influential American online publication Pitchfork Media ignited a controversy in November 2006 when it reviewed the Taiwanese version of the album by mistake. The review was critical of elements of the Taiwanese version which had been changed in the subsequent US release. Once the error was drawn to the publishers' attention they quickly commissioned another journalist to review the US version of the album. The music video for \"Steal the Blueprints\" was directed by Chris Deaner and won Best Video at the 7th Annual San Diego Asian Film Festival. Deaner also directed a video for the song Fadeout. The song \"For You\" is used prominently in Episode 19 of Season 5 of CSI: Miami."@en ;

dbr:Made_of_Flesh	rdf:type	schema:MusicAlbum ;
	dbo:abstract	"Made of Flesh is the seventh studio album by the German death metal band Fleshcrawl. It is considered the sequel to Soulskinner, and is the first of their albums to feature their current guitarist Oliver Grbavac, who joined the band to replace founding member Stefan Hanus and the last to feature bass guitarist Tobias Schick. Being widely considered a de facto sequel to Soulskinner, the two albums share a highly similar sound, which is general of Fleshcrawl's work since the late 1990s. Both albums feature prominent Swedish death metal-style guitar work, composed of eminently rhythmic riffing and short, moderately technical guitar solos, not unlike many contemporary bands of the melodic death metal genre, particularly Dismember, Grave, and to an extent, Arch Enemy. As is typical of Fleshcrawl's latest work, the melodic guitar rhythms are complimented with a familiar drum sound, consisting of blast beats incorporated into highly embossed, yet not obtrusive, rapid double-Bass drum-rolls, with semi-guttural death growls reminiscent of such Florida-based death metal bands as Cannibal Corpse, Six Feet Under, and Suffocation. Lyrical themes of this album remain consistent with those of previous Fleshcrawl Albums, and of death metal in general. Subjects cover gory themes and concepts of evil, including doomsday/the apocalypse (Beneath a Dying Sun; Damned in Fire), demons/demonic possession (Flesh Bloody Flesh; Demons of the Dead), damnation (Forged in Blood), and necrophagy (Carnal Devourment), among others. The Japanese release included a cover of 'Rockin' is my Business,' by The Four Horsemen, a late 80s Metal band from California; this song is dissimilar to every other song on the album, in that it doesn't cover general death metal lyrical themes of death, gore, violence, etc., but rather is about both the glory and tribulations of the Music Industry."@en ;

It was released in 1984 on Chrysalis Records and recorded with producer Michael James Jackson who previously worked for Kiss. The debut album yielded a minor MTV hit with \"Can U Deliver\", but Joey Vera and John Bush later recalled the album's recording as a frustrating and disappointing experience, explaining that Jackson's approach was much more commercial than the heavy metal sound the band had wanted. As Vera recalled in 2006: \"At the end of the record we were very unhappy with the production, the mix, the way we worked and who we worked with. And the producer and our manager let us spend over ($)300,000 on our first record. To this day we are still in debt for that one.\" In 2006, Rock Candy released a remastered version of March of the Saint with additional unreleased demo tracks."@en ;
