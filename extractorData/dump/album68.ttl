	dbo:abstract	"London Conversations: The Best of Saint Etienne is a compilation album by Saint Etienne. It was released as a deluxe 2CD/DVD set (packaged in a hardback book), standard 2-CD set and on double 12\" vinyl. It features the 2008 Xenomania Mix of \"Burnt Out Car\", the Richard X mix of \"This Is Tomorrow\" and \"Method of Modern Love\". The compilation features a selection of their regular A-sides on the first disc, while disc two includes various further A-sides, B-sides, non-singles and album tracks. Originally due for release in November 2008 following the re-release of \"Burnt Out Car,\" the set was delayed several times as a result of manufacturing issues as well as the introductory single's low chart position. In addition, a planned single-disc edition (featuring solely the first disc of the set) was cancelled. The set ultimately came out in February 2009 following the release of the newly recorded Richard X collaboration \"Method of Modern Love.\" Some early-run copies of the 2CD edition are available, though, omitting \"Method of Modern Love.\" The single-disc edition was eventually issued alongside remastered single-disc editions the rest of the band's catalogue in 2011, following the release of deluxe editions of most of their albums. In its week of release the compilation charted at #79 in the UK, missing out on the Top 75 in part due to a surge in older albums following the Brit Awards."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Shin-shiro (Japanese: \u30B7\u30F3\u30B7\u30ED Hepburn: Shinshiro, \"New White\") is the third studio album by Japanese band Sakanaction. It was released on January 21, 2009 through Victor Entertainment. The release was the band's first album after relocating to Tokyo and moving to Victor Entertainment's main roster. Led by the singles \"Sen to Rei\" and \"Native Dancer\", the album became the group's first release to chart in the top 10 albums on Oricon's weekly album chart. Shin-shiro featured a different production approach to the band's previous albums. Band vocalist Ichiro Yamaguchi collaborated with a different member of the band in a two-person demo session for each songs, instead of their previous approach involving all five members working together. This approach was difficult for pianist Emi Okazaki, who had no experience with song production previously, and for drummer Keiichi Ejima, who learnt the guitar specifically to record demos for this album. The first finished demo, created by Yamaguchi and bassist Ami Kusakari's for the song \"Sen to Rei\" strongly influenced the album's production. The album was well-received critically, with critics noting the band's growth; praising the band's electronic and pop sound, as well as Ichiro Yamaguchi's songwriting and vocals. The album led Sakanaction to be chosen one of the ten iTunes Japan Sound of 2009 artists, as well as nominated at the Life Music Award 2009. In 2009, the album was made available globally as a digital download, alongside the band's debut and second albums Go to the Future (2007) and Night Fishing (2008). In 2015, the album was reissued on CD, LP record and lossless digital formats."@en ;

Three singles were released from the album; \"Vomit\", \"Honey Bunny\" and \"My Ma\", the latter of which was released exclusively on vinyl with a limited 1000 copies in print. The album peaked at #37 on the Billboard 200 and received critical acclaim upon its release. A significant departure from the band's previous work, Father, Son, Holy Ghost elaborated with lavish production, gospel choirs and a more varied instrumentation that resulted in a sound that spanned various genres such as surf rock, folk, soul, hard rock, and even progressive rock. Unlike the group's debut Album, it was not exclusively produced by the band themselves but was a collaboration with veteran engineer Doug Boehm. The album's sound and composition style was noted to be part of a trend of modern indie revivalism artists who reach back decades into the past for inspiration, with songs such as \"Honey Bunny\", \"Love Like a River\" and lead single \"Vomit\" in particular being heavily influenced by music from the 1960s and 1970s. Of the album's 'old' style of production and the evolution of the band's sound, one critic noted \"(Father, Son, Holy Ghost) eschews Album's ramshackle scrappiness for the classic-rock-radio sophistication of Billy Preston-era Beatles and early-70s Pink Floyd.\" The album was recognized as one of The 100 Best Albums of the Decade So Far by Pitchfork Media in August 2014."@en ;

The first, third, fourth and fifth tracks were included through the courtesy of Barnaby Records, for whom Stevens recorded during the early seventies. The selection of \"Shriner's Convention\" is a live version that was taken from the album Ray Stevens Live! \"Gitarzan\" is the album version that begins with audience noises, and \"Ahab the Arab\" is a re-recording of his 1962 hit for his album Gitarzan (released in 1969). The remaining tracks are selections that were recorded for Curb Records; of these selections, only two were released as singles (\"Super Cop\" and \"The Motel Song\") and the rest served as album cuts. The sixth to ninth tracks were taken from the album Classic Ray Stevens, the tenth to thirteenth tracks from #1 With a Bullet, and the last seven from Lend Me Your Ears. Overall, it is not completely accurate to include the word \"hits\" in the title of this compilation, as it contains only seven songs that were previously released as singles and five of the seven made true impact on the charts.

Two of the selections satirize classic Christmas songs: \"I Won't Be Home for Christmas\" and \"The Little Drummer Boy-Next Door.\" The final track, \"Santa Claus Is Watching You,\" is a re-recording of Stevens' 1962 hit of the same name; this marks the third time that Stevens recorded this song, as he recorded it for a second time for his album I Have Returned. The front of the album cover shows Stevens with a Santa hat on his head and peaking through a window. A Christmas tree stands on the inside of the window.

Logan was fired shortly after touring in support of the band's first album due to his life style that negatively impacted his ability to perform. There were also rumors that he had quit the band while touring in support of Queensr\u00FFche, because he felt intimidated opening up for singer Geoff Tate. In a 1992 interview with Headbangers Ball, Lynch talked highly of Mason and stating, \"Mason tracked us down, saying he had to be the singer for the band. He knew he was right for the group. He flew himself out. He was very much the opposite of the last singer. He's very dedicated, has a lot of confidence in his abilities and can definitely take control of an audience\". Due to the rise of the grunge movement and changing musical trends, the album resulted in poorer sales figures than the previous album. However, it has received some positive critical reviews. The album also includes a cover of \"Tie Your Mother Down\", a song originally released by the British rock band Queen in 1976."@en ;

The album also includes a modified version of \"Days of Joy\" under a new name (which is actually the first name this song had originally when it was created in 2003), in addition to a brand new song and a cover song. As with its predecessor Sudden Death Syndrome, the album was co-produced, mixed and mastered at Fascination Street Studios, Orebro, Sweden by Jens Bogren The artwork of the album Summoning the Bygones won the Metal Riot's June Ultimate Cover Art Showdown."@en ;

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sunbather_(album)>	rdf:type	schema:MusicAlbum ;
	dbo:abstract	"Sunbather is the second studio album by the American metal band Deafheaven. After the release of their debut record Roads to Judah, the then two piece group consisting of George Clarke and Kerry Mccoy began work on Sunbather under the label Deathwish and recorded in several days in January 2013. The recording process brought a third member into the fold with drummer Dan Tracy who would go on to become a permanent fixture of the band. The album was recorded in The Atomic Garden Recording Studio, owned by Jack Shirley who had been a long time producer of the band. Although Deafheaven had been strongly influenced by black and other metal acts, their music drew comparisons from music critics to shoegaze, post-rock, and alternative rock sounds. This trend was further continued on Sunbather. The melancholic songs featured in the album include Wall of Sound arrangements that are found in many shoegazing and post-rock acts causing a dense sound that sometimes breakdown into slower, melodic parts that is then topped with vocalist George Clarke's reverb-soaked screaming style singing of lyrics. The album also contains a few interludes that include sampling, field recording, and droning. Sunbather was released in June 2013 and received widespread acclaim from critics, many of whom named it one of the year's best albums. However, the album was met with some controversy from the metal community for its diverse styles that strayed away from metal as well as backlash from the community due to the band's image, labeling them as \"hipster metal\". The band recruited musicians Shiv Mehra and Stephen Clark to help tour the album and continue as a more stable musician line up to help future music writing and confidence."@en ;

As a child, Hebden had inherited a collection of Hindu devotional musicfrom his late grandfather but did not listen to it until his maternal grandmother died during the making of his 2013 album, Beautiful Rewind. After sampling the voice of Indian playback singer Lata Mangeshkar, Hebden was inspired to make a record with a similar structure to Indian music, particularly the raga mode and decided to break the album into a \"Morning Side\" and an \"Evening Side\". Alongside the sampled vocals, Morning/Evening contains complex drum programming, electronic sounds and manipulated found sounds. Morning/Evening was announced in May 2015, with an expected release date of July 2015. It was made available tostream and download from Hebden's Bandcamp page on 21 June 2015 to celebrate the summer solstice. Music critics praised Hebden for continuing to release challenging and unique electronic music. The physical release of Morning/Evening became Hebden's second highest-charting album, peaking at number 48 in the UK Albums Chart."@en ;
