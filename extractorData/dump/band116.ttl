	dbo:abstract	"Aishah and The Fan Club, better known as The Fan Club or just Fan Club, were a New Zealand-based singing group in the late 1980s and early 1990s. The group released their first album Sensation in 1988, which spawned three top-20 singles in the New Zealand and Malaysian charts, namely \"Sensation\", \"Paradise\" and \"Call Me\" - the latter being a remake of a Spagna song of the same name. Their second album, titled Respect the Beat, also produced three hit singles, including \"I Feel Love\" and \"I Never Gave Up on You\", and the band's only single to make the US Billboard Hot 100 Charts - \"Don't Let Me Fall Alone\". The remixes for this song were among the most played dance tunes in clubs at the time. The group was formed while Wan Aishah binti Wan Ariffin was in New Zealand studying in the late 1980s. She was spotted by the other members of the group, and asked to join the band. Besides Aishah who sang lead vocals, the other members included Paul Moss on guitar and programming, Dave Larsen on drums, Glenn Peters on bass, Malcolm Smith on keyboards, and Hazri Yutim on second keyboard/synthesiser. Malcolm and Paul were also the main songwriters for the group. The band won the International Artist of the Year at the 1991 New Zealand Music Awards. Aishah remains popular in Malaysia and has released music in the Malay language. Paul Moss also lives in Malaysia where he has become a judge of the reality TV singing competitions Malaysian Idol and One in a Million."@en .

The band, which had a strong cult following, has released five studio albums, their first two considered the most influential. With a Hare Krishna background, they were among the first bands to fuse hardcore punk with thrash metal and were associated with the birth of a tougher attitude within the hardcore scene in the late 1980s, related to the world of martial arts. John Joseph McGowan and Harley Flanagan (formerly drummer for The Stimulators), are practitioners of boxing and Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu respectively. The Cro-Mags have gone through several line-up changes, and as of 2016, there are no constant members left in the band. According to AllMusic, \"before the Cro-Mags, the idea of combining heavy metal and hardcore together was unheard of. But with the release of their classic debut, The Age of Quarrel, hardcore-metal was born, and in its wake came a legion of similarly styled offspring (Biohazard, Vision of Disorder, etc.).\""@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Dragon is a rock band which was formed in Auckland, New Zealand, in January 1972 and relocated later to Sydney, Australia in May 1975. They were originally fronted by singer Marc Hunter and are currently led by his brother, bass player/vocalist Todd Hunter. They performed and released material under the name Hunter in Europe and the United States during 1987. Keyboard player Paul Hewson wrote or co-wrote most of the group's 1970s hits: \"April Sun in Cuba\" peaked at #2 on the 1977 Australian singles chart; \"Are You Old Enough?\" reached #1 in 1978; and \"Still in Love with You\" reached #15 also in 1978. Later hits, from when the band re-grouped in the 1980s, were written by other band members, often working with outside associates: The Hunter brothers, with Todd's partner, Johanna Pigott, wrote \"Rain,\" a #2 hit in 1983, while other, more minor hits were written by the Hunters and/or Alan Mansfield, frequently in collaboration with any combination of Pigott, Mansfield's partner Sharon O'Neill, Marc Hunter's partner Wendy Hunter, or producers Todd Rundgren and David Hirschfelder. The name Dragon came from a consultation of I Ching cards by early band vocalist Graeme Collins. Dragon have endured tragedy, adversity and notoriety, and during the course of the band's earlier career, several members died from drug-related causes. Problems began soon after their arrival in Sydney in late 1975, when all their equipment was stolen. Several months later, in 1976, drummer Neil Storey died of a heroin overdose; Paul Hewson of a drug overdose in 1985 and Marc Hunter of smoking-related oesophageal cancer in 1998. Several members of the group including Hewson and Marc Hunter were heavy heroin users during the band's heyday, and The Stewart Royal Commission (1980\u20131983) which investigated the Mr. Asia drug syndicate obtained evidence that Dragon members were clients. Two members were involved in a serious car crash in 1977, where Paul Hewson's neck was in a brace as well as having a broken arm and Robert Taylor needed plastic surgery, and Hewson also suffered from debilitating scoliosis and arthritis, the pain of which reportedly contributed to his heroin use. The band also undertook a famously disastrous 1978 tour of the USA, supporting Johnny Winter, which ended when Marc Hunter abused the Texan audience as \"faggots\" and the band were pelted off stage, while Winter's band were said to have taken bets about how long it would be before Hunter was shot. On 1 July 2008, the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) recognised Dragon's iconic status when they were inducted into the ARIA Hall of Fame."@en ;

Tamir \"Nokio\" Ruffin was the group's founder; his groupmates included lead singer Mark \"Sisq\u00F3\" Andrews, Larry \"Jazz\" Anthony, and James \"Woody Rock\" Green. Signing to Island Records through Haqq Islam's University Records imprint, the group released two successful albums, Dru Hill and Enter the Dru, before separating for a period from late 1999 to 2002, during which time Sisq\u00F3 and Woody released solo albums. While Woody's Soul Music LP was a moderate success in the gospel music industry, Sisq\u00F3's debut album, Unleash the Dragon, and its hit single, \"Thong Song\", were major pop successes, and established Sisq\u00F3 as a household name outside of Dru Hill. Sisq\u00F3's second album, Return of Dragon, did not sell as well. In 2002, by then part of the Def Soul record label, the group reunited and added fifth member Rufus \"Scola\" Waller to the lineup for their third album, Dru World Order, whose underperformance led to the group being dropped from Def Soul.

	dbo:abstract	"E.S. Posthumus was an independent music group that produced a form of 21st-century classical music/epic music that intertwined popular style drum rhythms with orchestral and electronic sounds. Their music is inspired by the Pythagorean philosophy which states that \"music is the harmonization of opposites; the conciliation of warring elements\". The E.S. is an acronym for \"Experimental Sounds\" while Posthumus (Latin: postumus, meaning \"after\" or \"end\") is a word that is meant to represent \"all things past\", suggesting the music was inspired by things that have ended, some time after they ended. The group was formed in 2000 by brothers Helmut and Franz Vonlichten. Helmut and Franz studied piano with their mother. After graduating from high school, Franz worked in recording studios while Helmut attended and graduated from UCLA, with a degree in archaeology. Their music has been licensed by many movie and television production studios, being included in numerous movie trailers and television shows. E.S. Posthumus released three albums overall in their career. On July 22, 2010, it was officially announced that Franz had died about two months before. After giving notice of his brother's death, Helmut stated that while there still may be one or two unreleased songs (one of them being their single \"Christmas Eve\" released in November 2010), the group would no longer be active. In November 2011, it was officially announced that Helmut Vonlichten had formed a new band called Les Friction, and released a preview of his new work with a track called \"Torture\"."@en ;

The group achieved 18 Top 20 singles and four Top 10 albums, and were one of the UK's most popular boy bands during the early to mid-1990s, aided by strong tabloid interest in their 'bad boy' image compared to the 'clean cut' image of rivals Take That. Their style blended pop and rap in songs such as \"House of Love\" and \"Let It Rain\".

After Brainiac, Schmersal made a solo album under the name John Stuart Mill. Rick Lee and Steve Calhoon were both previous members of the band Skeleton Key, a befriended band Brainiac had toured with. Together they formed Enon. Lee created a number of percussion sounds for the band playing a \"junk kit\" including a Radio Flyer wagon, propane tank, and old hubcaps. After the release of their first album Believo! which was Produced by D. Sardy and signed to his SeeThru Broadcasting label in 1999, Calhoon left the band and was replaced by Toko Yasuda (bass/vocals/keyboard) and Matt Schulz (drums). Yasuda was previously in the bands Blonde Redhead, The Lapse and The Van Pelt. With the new lineup, Enon released High Society also produced by Sardy in 2002 and toured with The Faint. A majority of Enon's albums have been released on the Chicago-based indie label, Touch and Go Records after the closing of SeeThru Broadcasting. Lee left the band, and Enon went on to release Hocus Pocus in 2003, and a collection of singles and previously difficult to find internet-released songs with a bonus DVD entitled Lost Marbles & Exploded Evidence in February 2005. In 2007, all three members of Enon contributed to Les Savy Fav's album Let's Stay Friends. Yasuda also did vocal contributions to previous recordings of this band, e.g. the first track of The Cat and the Cobra. Enon released their fourth and final studio album, Grass Geysers...Carbon Clouds on Touch and Go Records on October 9, 2007. In summer 2008, drummer Matt Schulz announced that he would be leaving the group to pursue other interests. Afterwards he joined Holy Fuck as a touring member. Brainiac's former bassist, Monasterio, directs music videos, including two for Enon, and released an album in 2008 with a new band called Model/Actress; Schmersal makes appearances on this album."@en ;

This resulted in the 1999 release \"Traces O' Red\" which received very positive response. In November 2000, they recorded their second album, \"Megalomania\", accompanied by drummer Asgeir Mickelson (Borknagar/Spiral Architect) and bass player Hans-Aage Holmen.

Their early work was heavily influenced by NWOBHM, and was key in the development of American power metal. With each work the band developed into a pure progressive metal style. Fates Warning has experienced numerous line-up changes. From 1982 to 1996 \u2014 and temporarily in 2010 \u2014 Matheos and DiBiase were the only remaining original members of the band, with Matheos being the only constant member. Their current lineup consists of guitarists Jim Matheos and Frank Aresti, vocalist Ray Alder, bassist Joey Vera, and drummer Bobby Jarzombek. As a pioneer of the American progressive metal movement, Fates Warning rose to international fame in the 1980s and was ranked as one of the early \"flagship bands of progressive metal\" along with Queensr\u00FFche, Dream Theater, Crimson Glory and Watchtower, who were responsible for creating, developing and popularizing that genre. Fates Warning has released twelve studio albums, two live albums, one compilation album, one VHS, three DVDs (each of them features live concerts) and four demo tapes. The band experienced major American commercial success with the 1986 release of their third studio album, Awaken the Guardian, which peaked at number No. 191 on the Billboard 200, and became the first album released on Metal Blade to enter that chart. Their next three albums, No Exit (1988), Perfect Symmetry (1989) and Parallels (1991), were also successful; the first two peaked at No. 111 and No. 141 on the Billboard 200 respectively. Fates Warning's most recent studio album, Theories of Flight, was released on July 1, 2016."@en ;

The band's history is riddled with a 'revolving door' lineup with 13 the only member to have never been replaced. After breaking up in 2001 when Wednesday 13 left to perform vocals with the Murderdolls, the band reformed for a brief reunion in 2005, releasing a box set containing their entire library of recordings except for the track \"Look Mom I Killed A Chicken\" because Wednesday 13's master copy was \"destroyed beyond repair\". This track is exclusively available on the 197666 7-inch LP and the band-released \"Chop off My Hand\" CD-R. The music of the Frankenstein Drag Queens was played in a punk rock style. Lyrically the band were inspired by horror B-movies and references in popular culture. As well as a large leaning towards punk the band's live show and appearance took cues from glam rock acts such as Alice Cooper, New York Dolls and KISS. They were known to wear dresses and make-up on stage as part of their performance."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"From First to Last is an American rock band based in Arizona, originally from the Los Angeles Area, Illinois and Tampa, Florida. The current line-up consists of bassist Matt Manning, guitarists Matt Good, Travis Richter and Taylor Larson and drummer Derek Bloom. The band released their first EP titled Aesthetic in 2003 which they recorded with founding member and vocalist Phillip Reardon who left the band in 2004 due to personal and creative differences. Dear Diary, My Teen Angst Has a Body Count followed in 2004 and Heroine in 2006, both with former vocalist Sonny Moore. Following the departure of Moore in February 2007 to work on his solo electronic project, Skrillex, the band added permanent bassist Matt Manning, and Matt Good moved to lead vocals/guitar. They released a self-titled album in 2008 on Suretone Records. On August 27, 2009, From First to Last confirmed on DJ Rossstar's Punk Rock Show that they have indeed left Suretone and are now signed to Rise Records. In late 2009, they parted ways with longtime guitarist/vocalist Travis Richter. Their fourth studio album, Throne to the Wolves was released on March 16, 2010. On July 28, 2010, the band entered a hiatus. In November 2013, From First to Last reformed after 3 years of hiatus and launched a Kickstarter campaign to fund the recording of a new EP with the return of guitarist/vocalist Travis Richter who had left the band in 2009. In April 2014 Richter and Good made a video announcement and re-recorded track teaser \"The Latest Plague\" from Heroine (2006) via Alternative Press with Periphery vocalist Spencer Sotelo confirming that Spencer was the new lead vocalist to feature on the band's upcoming second EP. In the latter part of May 2014 the new line up released a remake of the song \"Note to Self\" from Dear Diary, My Teen Angst Has a Body Count to commemorate the 10-year anniversary of the album. On January 13, 2015 the band released their eponymous lead single, \"Dead Trees\", from their recently released fifth album. The album was released on April 27, 2015 under the record label Sumerian Records as a LP and not an EP."@en ;

The band was known for the complexity and sophistication of its music and for the varied musical skills of its members. All of the band members, except Malcolm Mortimore, were multi-instrumentalists. Although not commercially successful, they did achieve a cult following. The band's onetime stated aim was to \"expand the frontiers of contemporary popular music at the risk of becoming very unpopular\", although this stance was to alter significantly with time. Gentle Giant's music was considered complex even by progressive rock standards, drawing on a broad swath of music including folk, soul, jazz, and classical music. Unlike many of their progressive rock contemporaries, their \"classical\" influences ranged beyond the Romantic and incorporated medieval, baroque, and modernist chamber music elements. The band also had a taste for broad themes for their lyrics, drawing inspiration not only from personal experiences but from philosophy and the works of both Fran\u00E7ois Rabelais and R. D. Laing. In 2015 they were recognised with the lifetime achievement award at the Progressive Music Awards."@en ;

The band's name comes from The Gore Gore Girls, a 1972 B-movie by Herschell Gordon Lewis, which is a parody of the term Go Go Girls. Like fellow Detroit bands The White Stripes and The Detroit Cobras, the band started out struggling through the local club circuit before being \"discovered\" by independent record label Get Hip Records in 1998. Their first single \"Mama in the Movies\" (1999) gained favourable airplay on college radio stations in Michigan, which led to recording their first full-length album Strange Girls in (2000). The second album Up All Night, was released in 2002 and received positive press from the Village Voice and Detroit Free Press. During this time the band toured Europe twice, in 2002 and in 2003, also with infrequent dates in the United States. The band became a four-piece in 2004 with the addition of The Hammer (Marlene Hammerle) on guitar and began touring the United States extensively. Gore Gore Girls toured as direct support for The Cramps in 2003 and 2004. The band released an EP in 2004, 7 X 4, which became part of their third album, Get the Gore. Tracks from the EP and subsequent third album received airplay on Little Steven's Underground Garage Program on Sirius Satellite Radio; the band was featured at Little Steven's Underground Garage Festival on Randall's Island, New York along with other 'garage rock' luminaries and legends The Stooges, The Strokes, The New York Dolls, The Zombies and others. Get the Gore, released in 2007 on Bloodshot Records, was recorded at Ghetto Recorders in Detroit, Michigan and received positive press from USA Today and Playboy Magazine. Gore Gore Girls toured Europe again in spring of 2008, the band's third tour of Scandinavia and Western European countries."@en ;

It was founded by Jairo Varela and Alexis Lozano. Varela remained with the group until his death in 2012, becoming producer, director, songwriter, vocalist and guiro player. Alexis Lozano, trombone player and arranger later left to form Orquesta Guayac\u00E1n. It also included Nicolas Cristancho, on the piano; Francisco Garcia, on the bass; Luis Pacheco, on the congas; as well as vocalists Jorge Baz\u00E1n and Hector Viveros. Grupo Niche's first album: \"Al Pasito\" was released in 1980, did little to challenge the dominating salsa band of Colombia at the time, Fruko y sus Tesos. The following year, however, the group found success with their second album, \"Querer es Poder\", particularly with the single \"Buenaventura y Caney\". The group relocated in 1982 to Cali where they have been based since. After recording two more albums, Grupo Niche released \"No Hay Quinto Malo\" in 1984, which featured their signature song, \"Cali Pachanguero\". The tribute hit single to the \"world salsa capital\" catapulted Niche as one of the top salsa bands of Colombia. In 1986, the band incorporated Puerto Rican vocalist Tito Gomez, who had previously worked with the famous Puerto Rican salsa group, la Sonora Ponce\u00F1a, and Ray Barretto, the Godfather of Latin Jazz. Later that year, Grupo Niche released \"Me Huele a Matrimonio\". Afterward, yet another Puerto Rican joined, the pianist Israel Tanenbaum, who would eventually leave the group to join a Niche spin-off band: Orquesta Guayac\u00E1n. Grupo Niche is known for both its vigorous, uptempo dance music as well as slower-paced romantic numbers. Among its best known hits are \"Cali Aji\", \"Del Puente Pa'll\u00E1\", \"Sin Sentimientos\", \"Una Aventura\", \"Etnia\", \"Gotas de Lluvia\", \"Han Cogido la Cosa\", \"Mi Pueblo Natal\", \"Hagamos Lo Que Diga Coraz\u00F3n\", \"Duele Mas\", \"Nuestro Sue\u00F1o\", and the famous cumbia \"Canoa Rancha\".Their most famous song is \"Cali Pachanguero\". Some other singers from Niche throughout its history include Alvaro del Castillo, La Coco Lozano, Tuto Jim\u00E9nez, Saulo Sanchez, Tito Gomez, Moncho Santana, Charlie Cardona as well as Willy Garcia and Javier Vasquez, now members of the group 'Son de Cali'. Most recently joined are the Puerto Ricans Oswaldo Roman and Julio Lopez and actual singer Elvis Magno from Buenaventura. They have been very successful, and some of their songs are considered Classics of Salsa Music. The group still enjoys some of its past successes, and keeps on tour, making worldwide presentations, and singing their most memorable songs. Musician Tito Gomez, who fronted the group for seven and half years (1985\u20131992), died on June 12, 2007 in Cali, the city of the Grupo Niche where he had stablished."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Gwar, often styled as GWAR, is an American heavy metal/hardcore punk band formed in Richmond, Virginia in 1984, composed of and operated by a frequently rotating line-up of musicians, artists and filmmakers collectively known as Slave Pit Inc.. Following the death of frontman and lead singer Dave Brockie in 2014, the group has continued without any original members, although Don Drakulich, a non-instrument-performing member of the collective, has been with the band since 1985. Easily identified by their distinctively grotesque costumes, Gwar's core thematic and visual concept revolves around an elaborate science fiction-themed mythology which portrays the band members as barbaric interplanetary warriors, a narrative which serves as the basis for all of the band's albums, videos, live shows and other media. Rife with over-the-top violent, sexual, and scatological humour typically incorporating social and political satire, Gwar have attracted both acclaim and controversy for their music and stage shows, the latter of which notoriously showcase enactments of graphic violence that result in the audience being sprayed with copious amounts of fake blood, urine, and semen. Such stagecraft regularly leads Gwar to be labeled a \"shock rock\" band by the media. Since their formation, Gwar have released thirteen studio albums, two live albums, and numerous singles among other recordings, and have sold over 820,000 records in the United States. Fueled largely by the controversies surrounding their concerts, Gwar experienced brief mainstream notoriety during the first half of the 1990s, receiving regular airplay on MTV as well as frequent in-character guest appearances on daytime talk shows, satirizing the topics of censorship and media violence. Though the band's mainstream popularity declined by the end of the 1990s, Gwar has retained a dedicated cult following. The band's extensive videography consists of both live recordings and long-form feature films, most notably 1992's Phallus in Wonderland, which earned a Grammy Award nomination for Best Long Form Music Video. Outside of music and video, Gwar has expanded their franchise into comic books, trading cards, a board game, signature beers, barbecue sauces, and e-liquids."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Henry Cow were an English avant-rock group, founded at Cambridge University in 1968 by multi-instrumentalists Fred Frith and Tim Hodgkinson. Henry Cow's personnel fluctuated over their decade together, but drummer Chris Cutler and bassoonist/oboist Lindsay Cooper were important long-term members alongside Frith and Hodgkinson. An inherent anti-commercial attitude kept them at arm's length from the mainstream music business, enabling them to experiment at will. Critic Myles Boisen writes, \"their sound was so mercurial and daring that they had few imitators, even though they inspired many on both sides of the Atlantic with a blend of spontaneity, intricate structures, philosophy, and humor that has endured and transcended the 'progressive' tag.\" While it was generally thought that Henry Cow took their name from 20th-century American composer Henry Cowell, this has been repeatedly denied by band members. According to Hodgkinson, the name \"Henry Cow\" was \"in the air\" in 1968, and it seemed like a good name for the band. It had no connection to anything."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Indian Ocean is an Indian rock band formed in New Delhi in 1990, who are widely recognized as the pioneers of the fusion rock genre in India. Susmit Sen, Asheem Chakravarty, Rahul Ram and Amit Kilam were band members till Chakravarty's death on 25 December 2009, after which Tuheen Chakravorty and Himanshu Joshi were officially inducted into the band as replacements. After the departure of Susmit Sen in 2013, Rahul Ram is the only founding member who appeared on the band's debut album Indian Ocean. The musical style of the band can be at best classified as jazz fusion and fusion music. It is an experimental genre, fusing raga (traditional Indian tunes) with rock music, guitars and drums, sometimes using Indian folk songs. It has also been described by some music critics as \"Indo-rock fusion with jazz-spiced rhythms that integrates shlokas, sufism, environmentalism, mythology and revolution\". Since 2010, the band has moved against the lines of record labels. They released their latest album 16/330 Khajoor Road online for free. The main reason for this move was the frustration over negotiating contracts with record companies and fighting over copyright issues. They have turned to concerts and sponsorships for generating revenue rather than playing in the hands of record labels. For a brief amount of time they had the sponsorship of Johnnie Walker. They are also a part of the world's first Music Personalisation Initiative named DRP as one of the five Featured Artists. In its 2014 listing of \"25 Greatest Indian Rock Songs of the last 25 Years\", \"Rolling Stone India\" featured two songs, Ma Rewa and Kandisa from the album, Kandisa (2000)."@en ;

Formed by guitarist Graham Lambert and singer Stephen Holt, the latter of which departed the band prior to the band signing with Mute Records, the band's sound was characterised by the use of organ playing and distorted guitars. The band both preceded and was a part of the late 1980s and early 1990s Madchester movement. In 2011, Tom Hingley, who featured on all of the band's studio albums during their original run, departed the band. Hingley and Boon gave conflicting accounts of his departure, with Hingley stating that he had been sacked and Boon stating that he had chosen to leave.

Following a period of several years working behind the scenes in music production, multi-instrumentalist and producer/engineer Piet Sielck joined with former Helloween bandmate Kai Hansen and then-drummer for Blind Guardian Thomen Stauch in a new project that would blend power metal with a high-concept science fiction story. The band's debut album Iron Savior introduced the story that would be told over the course of multiple albums, featuring a self-aware space vessel called the Iron Savior and its relationship to the mythical lost civilization of Atlantis. Critics have compared Iron Savior's sound and musical approach to classic heavy metal bands like Judas Priest, Iron Maiden, and Queensr\u00FFche. Kai Hansen's presence in the band brought to the Iron Savior albums on which he appeared a style heavily influenced by Gamma Ray and Helloween. Since its inception, Iron Savior has released nine studio albums, two EPs, two singles and one live album. Despite numerous lineup changes, Piet has continued to direct the band and is currently the only remaining founding member."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Karate was an American band, formed in Boston, Massachusetts in 1993 by Geoff Farina, Eamonn Vitt and Gavin McCarthy. In 1995, Jeff Goddard joined the band as bass player, and Vitt moved to second guitar. Vitt departed Karate to pursue a medical career in 1997. The band was characterised by their love for improvised music and classic rock and their adherence to the DIY punk ethos of their youth, which made them difficult to classify, being a strange fusion of indie rock, punk, blues, jazz and post-rock. Farina developed hearing problems due to twelve years of performance with Karate and was forced to disband the group in July 2005, quietly closing the door on a 12-year run that included 6 studio albums and almost 700 performances in 20 countries. Their final show was played in Rome, Italy, on July 10, 2005. Their music was primarily released on Southern Records. Karate\u2019s perfectionism and attention to detail is well known among the music scene. Their compulsive behaviour manifested also in naming their last recording, which was originally called \u201C594\u201D since it was believed to be a recording of their 594th show. When Gavin discovered a flyer for a forgotten early show that had somehow evaded Jeff\u2019s memory, the band quickly changed the title to \u2018595\u2019. Finally, In 2007, the former band members decided to release the live album 595. Often, Karate was sent live material from their own performances (often from sound technicians). This happened also after their performance on May 5 at Stuk, Leuven, Belgium. Karate was so astonished by the quality of the recording they decided to release this \"posthumous\" live album of their 595th live performance. On his own, Geoff Farina has also developed a solo career with three albums and a handful of EPs over the years, some released while the band was still around, and thus far one since Karate disbanded."@en ;

Toby Driver is the only founding member of the band still remaining, save for frequent lyrical contributions from former motW member Jason Byron, culminating in a guest track on the Hubardo album. Up until 2011, the lineup was constantly shifting, and Kayo Dot's sound consistently changed over the years, featuring a wide variety of instrumentation featuring guitar, drums, bass, violin, saxophone, vibraphone, synthesizers, clarinets and flutes. Underground metal audiences warmly received the group upon its early existence, with the 2003 album Choirs of the Eye and the 2006 album Dowsing Anemone with Copper Tongue both becoming underground hits in the progressive metal scene. Over the years, in addition to the rotating lineup and constantly changing sounds, Kayo Dot has been signed to a number of different record labels, Tzadik, Robotic Empire, Hydra Head before taking to Kickstarter and pre-orders to crowdfund their albums, as to be free of record label interference. The group signed to The Flenser in 2014. As of 2016, Kayo Dot has released eight studio albums, one EP and one split: Choirs of the Eye in 2003, Dowsing Anemone with Copper Tongue as well as Kayo Dot/Bloody Panda Split in 2006, Blue Lambency Downward, Coyote in 2010, an EP titled Stained Glass in 2011, Gamma Knife in 2012 and a double-album Hubardo in 2013.

	dbo:abstract	"Leb i sol (Macedonian: \u041B\u0435\u0431 \u0438 \u0441\u043E\u043B) is a Macedonian rock group founded in the 1970s by Vlatko Stefanovski (guitar), Bodan Arsovski (bass guitar), Nikola Kokan Dimu\u0161evski (keyboards) and Garabet Tavitjan (drums). Tavitjan ceded the drumwork to Dragoljub \u0110uri\u010Di\u0107 for some of the albums, while Kiril D\u017Eajkovski replaced Kokan on Kao Kakao and Putujemo. Beside being the most eminent Macedonian band, they were also one of the most important acts of the former Yugoslav Rock scene. \"Leb i sol\" is a traditional greeting which literally translates to \"bread and salt\". It is often used as an expression of spite or determination; e.g. \"I will eat bread and salt if I have to, but I will not give in!\", but that has nothing to do with the band's name. More commonly, distinguished visitors to villages and communities would be offered a piece of home-baked bread and a dip of salt as a traditional welcome, which is where the name of the band really came from. Their music combined elements of rock, jazz fusion and ethnic Macedonian music. As the band matured, the jazz influences became less obvious. However, in concert, Leb i sol performances of jazzed-up and lengthy versions of traditional ethno-folk classics such as \"Jovano Jovanke\" or \"Aber Dojde Donke\", were often received with great enthusiasm and cheer. Leb i sol were very popular in the 1970s and 1980s and, while not selling as many records as some pop and folk acts, were very well known and respected and often sold-out venues in most of the larger cities in the former Yugoslavia. The first two albums are often considered foundational, while most are diverse enough to be, at least in part, accessible to a fairly wide audience. The influence of ethnic music and folk music of Republic of Macedonia are recognizable in the use of odd meters (5/4, 7/8) and non-traditional scales (e.g. the Phrygian dominant scale). While all the musicians were fairly accomplished, Vlatko Stefanovski is frequently regarded as an exceptional guitar virtuoso."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Living Loud was a recording project featuring bass player and songwriter Bob Daisley, Uriah Heep drummer Lee Kerslake, guitarist Steve Morse of Deep Purple and Cold Chisel singer Jimmy Barnes. Deep Purple keyboards player Don Airey made a guest appearance. According to the liner notes of the self-titled album, the project was instigated by Daisley who had discussed with Kerslake the possibility of \"re-doing some of the songs from the classic rock albums that they had co-written\". Six of those songs, \"I Don't Know\", \"Crazy Train\", \"Flying High Again\", \"Mr. Crowley\", \"Tonight\" and \"Over the Mountain\" originally appeared on the Ozzy Osbourne albums Blizzard of Ozz and Diary of a Madman. In 2002, Osbourne had re-issued both albums with Daisley and Kerslake's original performances replaced by new bass and drum tracks after both men had sued the singer for non-payment of royalties and related issues (despite playing on Diary of a Madman, Daisley and Kerslake's performances were credited to Rudy Sarzo and Tommy Aldridge for many years). In August, 2003, Daisley, Kerslake, Barnes and Morse recorded the album in Florida. Along with the Osbourne songs, the group also wrote five new tracks. Airey (who had also worked on the first two Osbourne albums and whose contributions were also uncredited) recorded his parts in London. Living Loud was released in 2004. While Morse and Airey were touring Australia with Deep Purple that year, Living Loud played two live shows, one at the Metro in Melbourne, and one at Fox Studios in Sydney. The latter event was recorded and released on DVD in 2005."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Lonestar is an American country music group consisting of Richie McDonald (lead vocals, acoustic guitar), Michael Britt (lead guitar, background vocals), Keech Rainwater (drums), and Dean Sams (keyboards, background vocals). Before the group's foundation in 1992, both Rainwater and Britt were members of the group Canyon. John Rich (bass guitar, lead and background vocals) was a member until he left in 1998, and later became one half of the duo Big & Rich, as well as a Nashville songwriter and record producer. Between 2007 and 2011, McDonald exited the band for a solo career, with former McAlyster lead singer Cody Collins replacing him as lead vocalist in this timespan. Lonestar has charted more than 20 singles on Hot Country Songs, including 9 that reached No. 1: \"No News\", \"Come Cryin' to Me\", \"Amazed\", \"Smile\", \"What About Now\", \"Tell Her\", \"I'm Already There\", \"My Front Porch Looking In\", and \"Mr. Mom\". \"Amazed\" also charted at No 1 on the Billboard Hot 100, becoming the first country song to do so since \"Islands in the Stream\" in 1983. \"Amazed\" and \"My Front Porch Looking In\" were the top country songs of 1999 and 2003, respectively, on Billboard Year-End. The group has recorded seven albums, one EP, and a greatest hits package for the defunct BNA Records, and one album each for three different independent labels. Three of their albums have been certified platinum or higher by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). The band's first two albums were defined by honky-tonk and neotraditionalist country influences, but subseuqent albums largely drew from country pop. Along with his work with the band, McDonald has co-written singles for Clay Walker, The Wilkinsons, Billy Dean, and Sara Evans, in addition to releasing two solo albums and singing guest vocals on Mindy McCready's 1996 single \"Maybe He'll Notice Her Now\"."@en ;

The band consists of four regular members: RAS-1 (lead vocals and guitar), Trey Pangborn (guitar), Eric Wilson (bass guitar) and Damion Ramirez (drums). Shortbus originated as a side project of RAS-1 and Eric Wilson, eventually taking shape after the Long Beach Dub Allstars disbanded in 2002. The band is something of a Supergroup: Eric Wilson from Sublime and Long Beach Dub Allstars, RAS-1 also from Long Beach Dub Allstars, Trey Pangborn from the Falling Idols and Bargain Music and Damion Ramirez from Capitol Eye. The latter two bands, albeit not as well known, were quintessential Long Beach bands that helped influence the sound of Long Beach Shortbus today. Their first CD was a self-titled EP and featured their hit \"California Grace.\" Their second CD was entitled Flying Ship of Fantasy, featuring tracks from their first album. \"California Grace\" is also available on the soundtrack to the MTV reality series Laguna Beach. On October 7, 2007, it was announced that the band would be parting ways. Their final show took place at the Haunted Ball And Chain festival in San Diego, CA, on November 2 and 3. Eric Wilson is now in Sublime with Rome, a new incarnation of Sublime which chiefly performs songs by that band and features Rome Ramirez filling in for their late singer/guitarist Bradley Nowell."@en ;

In 2005, M.Y.M.P. released their second album titled Beyond Acoustic and third album Versions through Ivory Music. The success of the two albums prompted the re-release of their second and third albums in a two-disc set the same year. In 2006, they released their fourth album, New Horizon and DVD of their concert at the Music Museum. In 2008, M.Y.M.P. released their last album on Ivory Music, titled Now, as the group signed a deal with Star Music."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Madredeus (Portuguese pronunciation: [ma\u00F0\u027E\u0268\u02C8\u00F0ew\u0283]) is a Portuguese musical ensemble. Their music combines traditional Portuguese music (which is sometimes erroneously associated with the subgenre of Fado) with influences of modern folk music. The lyrics are often melancholy, related to the sea or travelling or absence, continuing a tradition of songs dating back to Medieval times (with obvious connection to cantigas de amigo among others). Madredeus founding members were Pedro Ayres Magalh\u00E3es (classical guitar), Rodrigo Le\u00E3o (keyboard synthesizer), Francisco Ribeiro (cello), Gabriel Gomes (accordion) and Teresa Salgueiro (vocals). Magalh\u00E3es and Le\u00E3o formed the band in 1985, Ribeiro and Gomes joined in 1986. In search of a female singer, they found Teresa Salgueiro in one of Lisbon's night clubs. Teresa agreed to join and, in 1987, Madredeus recorded their first album, Os dias da Madredeus. The first album was recorded in their rehearsal space, a converted abbey in Lisbon. The recording was especially strenuous due to deafening interruptions every 5 minutes from Lisbon's tram service, which ran directly above. In honour of this unavoidable presence in their every performance, they named themselves after the surrounding neighborhood, Madre de Deus (Mother of God), shortened to the vernacular Madredeus. In 1993, Pedro Ayres Magalh\u00E3es left the band temporarily and was replaced in live concerts by Jos\u00E9 Peixoto (classical guitar). Magalh\u00E3es rejoined the group later, making it a sextet with two guitarists. They released several albums and became very popular in Portugal, but remained relatively unknown abroad. This changed in 1994 when Wim Wenders, impressed by their music, asked Madredeus to perform in his movie Lisbon Story - the soundtrack gave the band international fame. Madredeus consequently toured Europe, South America, Africa and Asia. In 1994, Rodrigo Le\u00E3o left the band to start a solo career, being replaced by Carlos Maria Trindade (keyboard synthesizer). In 1997, Francisco Ribeiro and Gabriel Gomes left the band as Madredeus' style started abandoning its fado roots with the release of O Para\u00EDso. At this time Fernando J\u00FAdice (Acoustic bass guitar) was invited to join them. The group would, again, be a quintet.Madredeus has sold over 3 million albums worldwide. In 1998, Madredeus contributed \"Os Dias S\u00E3o A Noite (Suso Saiz Remix)\" to the AIDS benefit compilation album Onda Sonora: Red Hot + Lisbon produced by the Red Hot Organization. In November 2007, Teresa Salgueiro announced she had left Madredeus and she has released six solo albums until now. Former member and co-founder Francisco Ribeiro released his first solo album Desiderata: A Jun\u00E7\u00E3o do Bem in 2009. He died on 14 September 2010 from cancer. In April 2012 Madredeus announced its new album Essencia. This album is a travel through Madredeus music for 25 years since it was formed. Madredeus announced too its new formation, composed of Beatriz Nunes (singer), Pedro Ayres de Magalh\u00E3es (guitar), Carlos Maria Trinidade (synthesizer), Jorge Varrecoso (violin), Antonio Figueirido (violin) and Luis Clode (cello). With this new formation Pedro Ayres said in an interview: \"The melody is much more supported, without losing harmonic and rhythmic sense and keeps walking Madredeus\"."@en ;

After modest success in the United States in the mid-1990s with the singles \"Slowly, Slowly\" and \"Open the Door\" and a series of albums produced by Michael Stipe, Bob Mould, and Geza X, the band went on an extended hiatus due to the dissolution of their record label. They returned with a new rhythm section in 2005 on the Daemon Records release Mouthfeel. The band has continued to perform and record since this reunion and have self-released two more albums.

The group's current line-up consists of vocalist/guitarist Fher Olvera, drummer Alex \"El Animal\" Gonz\u00E1lez, guitarist Sergio Vall\u00EDn, and bassist Juan Calleros. Man\u00E1 has earned four Grammy Awards, eight Latin Grammy Awards, five MTV Video Music Awards Latin America, six Premios Juventud awards, nineteen Billboard Latin Music Awards and fifteen Premios Lo Nuestro awards. It is considered by many as the most influential and successful Latin American band of all time with over 40 million albums sold worldwide. Man\u00E1 has topped the all-time lists in much of Latin America and in their native Mexico, where they set landmarks in record sales and concert attendances. The band formed in 1986 and released its first album, Falta Amor, in 1990. In 1992, the group released \u00BFD\u00F3nde Jugar\u00E1n Los Ni\u00F1os?, which sold more than 10 million copies worldwide, (over 700,000 copies in the US alone) becoming the best selling Spanish-language rock album of all time. After several lineup changes, the group released Cuando los \u00C1ngeles Lloran (1995), which is noted for its stylistic departure from the band's previous work. Man\u00E1 followed with Sue\u00F1os L\u00EDquidos (1997), Revoluci\u00F3n de Amor (2002), and Amar es Combatir (2006), which continued the group's success. The band followed up with Drama y Luz in April 2011. Their most recent album is Cama Incendiada, which was released in early 2015. The band's sound draws from pop rock, Latin pop, calypso, reggae and ska music genres. They initially received international commercial success in Australia and Spain and have since gained popularity and exposure in the US, Western Europe, Asia, and the Middle East."@en ;

Their original hit songs were generated by Mombassa, O'Doherty, Plaza and Smith, either individually or collectively; they also hit the Australian charts with covers of songs by Roy Orbison, Elvis Presley and Chuck Berry. Their top ten Australian singles are \"If You Leave Me, Can I Come Too?\" and \"Too Many Times\" (both from 1981), \"Live It Up\" (1985) and \"Rock and Roll Music\" (1988). Internationally, \"Too Many Times\" made the Canadian top 40 in 1982, and \"Live It Up\" peaked at No. 3 in UK, No. 4 in Norway, and No. 6 in Germany, after it featured in the 1986 Australian film \"Crocodile\" Dundee. All of the early members are visual artists and have had combined studio displays, some have had solo studio displays with Mombassa's artwork also used as designs by the Mambo clothing company. The majority of the group's record covers, posters and video clips have been designed and created by themselves or their art school contemporaries.

The band's best-known lineup consisted of lead vocalist Gerard Way, guitarists Ray Toro and Frank Iero, bassist Mikey Way and drummer Bob Bryar. Founded by Gerard, Mikey, Toro, Matt Pelissier, and later joined by Iero, the band signed to Eyeball Records and released their debut album I Brought You My Bullets, You Brought Me Your Love in 2002. They signed with Reprise Records the next year and released their major label debut Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge in 2004. Shortly after the album's release, Pelissier was replaced by Bob Bryar. A commercial success, the album was awarded platinum status over a year later. The band eclipsed their previous success with their 2006 concept album, The Black Parade, which gained generally favorable reviews among music critics and was certified double platinum in the United Kingdom, the band's first and only double platinum. After the departure of long-time drummer Bob Bryar in March 2010, the band released their fourth studio album, Danger Days: The True Lives of the Fabulous Killjoys, in November that same year, to positive reviews. After the addition of touring keyboardist James Dewees in 2012 and the release of Conventional Weapons, a series of singles recorded in 2009, released over the course of five months, the band announced its break-up on March 22, 2013, one month after the final release in the Conventional Weapons series. After the band's split, a greatest hits album entitled May Death Never Stop You was released in March 2014. A tenth anniversary reissue of The Black Parade was released in September 2016 titled The Black Parade/Living with Ghosts."@en ;

The band's sound, rooted in rock and country, is often experimental and psychedelic. The group amassed a following beginning in the 2000s in part due to their live performances. The group first found success in Europe after the release of their debut album, The Tennessee Fire (1999). Their next release, At Dawn (2001), led to a large stateside following and preceded several lineup changes. After signing to major label ATO Records, the group released two albums, It Still Moves (2003) and Z (2005), with the latter representing a critical breakthrough. Their next release, Evil Urges (2008), was more polarizing for fans and critics, while Circuital (2011), their sixth album, saw a more measured response. After many years of side projects and touring, the band's seventh album, The Waterfall, was released in 2015."@en ;

The band are unusual for using two bass players in their lineup: Alex Griffin plays melody lines high up on one bass, and Mat Cheslin plays the regular bass lines on the other. This gives the band a tense and highly driven sub-hardcore sound featuring distorted effects-laden guitar and energetic drums. The band was formed while at sixth form college and they recorded their first album while some of the members were still teenagers. This led to a strong teenaged fanbase with a reputation for enjoying crowd surfing and moshing at their gigs. The band was also noted (and occasionally ridiculed) for their early image, which consisted of uniformly crimped hair and a predilection for sporting shorts and band or skateboard T-shirts. \"The Neds\" (as their fans referred to them) were well known for their own distinctive T-shirts, reportedly producing over 86 different designs within three years (1987\u20131990).

Their sound genre mixes electronica with musical elements and instrumentation of Tambora and Norte\u00F1o music, resulting in the nortec (\"norte\u00F1o\" + \"techno\") style. The various projects began producing and performing Nortec music around 1999. In 2001, they were signed to a recording contract with Palm Pictures, that released their first album \"Tijuana Session Volume 1\" under the name Nortec Collective. The line-up for that album included Bostich, Clorofila, Fussible, Hiperboreal, Panoptica, Plankton Man and Terrestre. The latter two would leave Nortec Collective in 2002. Nortec Collective's second album, Tijuana Sessions, Vol. 3, (Nacional Records) received much critical praise and was nominated for two Latin Grammy awards in 2006. In 2008, Nortec Collective ceased to function as a proper collective, with the various individual projects performing and recording separately. According to the Collective's Myspace page, \"For the time being, Nortec Collective has decided to release music separately \u2026\" and \"Until further notice, there will be not be any bookings for Nortec, Nortec Collective or Colectivo Nortec with the full four member line-up.\" The various individual projects went on to release and perform separately. 2008's Tijuana Sound Machine by Bostich and Fussible (also Nacional Records) was nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Latin Rock/Alternative Album. The Nortec Collective has borrowed several elements of Banda music sub-culture and have used them both in their songs (Narcoteque, Almada) and in their visuals and album covers."@en ;

Formed in Austin, Texas in 1998, the band takes its name from a short story by Russian author Tatyana Tolstaya set on the river in St Petersburg. They began as a trio made up of Sheff and friends he'd met in his native state of New Hampshire but, over time, have gone through many lineups. Okkervil River self-released their first album, Stars Too Small to Use, which led them to the South by Southwest music festival. After recording their first album in a garage, they signed with Jagjaguwar. They continued by releasing four more albums, including the critically lauded concept album Black Sheep Boy. After a period of touring for Black Sheep Boy, Okkervil River followed up with The Stage Names. The album sold 10,000 in its opening week in the United States. The group released a free covers album, Golden Opportunities Mixtape from their live performances. The band has garnered positive critical reception. They have appeared on the talk show Late Night with Conan O'Brien and have performed with acts such as The Decemberists, The New Pornographers, The National, and Lou Reed. Okkervil River released the album The Stand Ins on 9 September 2008. They promoted the release with a series of cover songs from the album on YouTube by people they've met as a band. Their 2010 collaboration as a backing band with psychedelic rocker Roky Erickson yielded True Love Cast Out All Evil. On 10 May 2011, Okkervil River released their sixth full-length album, I Am Very Far, which peaked at No. 32 on the Billboard 200. The band released their seventh album, The Silver Gymnasium, on 3 September 2013. The album peaked at No. 66 on the Billboard 200. The band\u2019s most recent album, Away, was released on September 9th, 2016 on ATO Records."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Old Crow Medicine Show is an Americana string band based in Nashville, Tennessee that has been recording since 1998. They were formally inducted into the Grand Ole Opry on September 17, 2013. Their ninth album, Remedy, released in 2014, won the Grammy Award for Best Folk Album. The group's music has been called old-time, folk, and alternative country. Along with original songs, the band performs many pre-World War II blues and folk songs. Bluegrass musician Doc Watson discovered the band while its members were busking outside a pharmacy in Boone, North Carolina in 2000. With an old-time string sound fueled by punk rock energy, it has influenced acts like Mumford & Sons and contributed to a revival of banjo-picking string bands playing Americana music\u2014leading to variations on it. The band released five studio albums\u2014O.C.M.S. (2004), Big Iron World (2006), Tennessee Pusher (2008), Carry Me Back (2012), and Remedy (2014). Their song \"Wagon Wheel\", written by frontman Ketch Secor through a co-authoring arrangement with Bob Dylan, was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America in April 2013 and has been covered by a number of acts, including Darius Rucker, who made the song a top 40 hit. The band was featured along with Edward Sharpe and the Magnetic Zeros and Mumford and Sons in the music documentary Big Easy Express, which won a Grammy Award for Best Long Form Music Video in 2013. They performed on the Railroad Revival Tour across the U.S. in 2011. They appeared at the Stagecoach Festival 2013 and multiple times at other major festivals, e.g., Bonnaroo Music Festival, MerleFest, Telluride Bluegrass Festival, Hardly Strictly Bluegrass Festival, and Newport Folk Festival. They make frequent guest appearances on A Prairie Home Companion with Garrison Keillor.

After recording their debut single \"Ode to a Forgetful Mind\" in 1988, P.M. Dawn released their first album Of the Heart, of the Soul and of the Cross: The Utopian Experience in 1991 to critical acclaim. It achieved immediate commercial success because of its single \"Set Adrift on Memory Bliss\". Their 1993 follow-up The Bliss Album\u2026? (Vibrations of Love and Anger and the Ponderance of Life and Existence) was also praised by critics and featured the hit singles \"I'd Die Without You\" and \"Looking Through Patient Eyes\". P.M.

The band consists of Jared Leto (lead vocals, guitar, bass, keyboards), Shannon Leto (drums, percussion) and Tomo Mili\u010Devi\u0107 (lead guitar, bass, violin, keyboards, other instruments). The band's debut album, 30 Seconds to Mars (2002), was produced by Bob Ezrin and released to positive reviews but only to limited commercial success. The band achieved worldwide fame with the release of their second album A Beautiful Lie (2005), which received multiple certifications all over the world, including platinum in the United States. Their next release, This Is War (2009), showed a dramatic evolution in the band's musical style, as they incorporated experimental music as well as eclectic influences. The recording process of the album was marked by a legal dispute with record label EMI that eventually became the subject of the documentary film Artifact (2012). Thirty Seconds to Mars then moved to Universal Music and released the fourth album, Love, Lust, Faith and Dreams (2013), to critical and commercial success. As of September 2014, the band has sold over 15 million albums worldwide. Thirty Seconds to Mars has consistently enjoyed sold out tours and numerous headlining festival slots. The band is noted for its energetic live performances and for fusing many music genres. They have been compared to the sounds of bands such as Pink Floyd, The Cure, Tool, and U2, for their philosophical and spiritual lyrics, concept albums and their use of experimental music. Thirty Seconds to Mars has received several awards and accolades throughout their career, including a Guinness World Record, and has been included in the Kerrang! list of best artists of the 2000s."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Wolfmother is an Australian hard rock band from Sydney, New South Wales. Formed in 2000 by vocalist and guitarist Andrew Stockdale, bassist and keyboardist Chris Ross, and drummer Myles Heskett, the group currently includes Stockdale, bassist and keyboardist Ian Peres, and touring drummer Alex Carapetis. Wolfmother released their self-titled debut album Wolfmother in Australia in 2005, and internationally in 2006, which has since sold over 1.5 million copies worldwide and won the band a number of industry awards. Ross and Heskett left the band in 2008. Stockdale returned with a new lineup featuring Peres, rhythm guitarist Aidan Nemeth and drummer Dave Atkins in 2009, releasing Cosmic Egg later in the year. After more personnel changes, the group's planned third album was released in 2013 as Keep Moving, a Stockdale solo album. Later that year, Wolfmother returned as a trio featuring Peres and drummer Vin Steele for 2014's New Crown. The band's fourth album, Victorious, featured two guest drummers and was released in 2016. Wolfmother have been categorised by various commentators within the genres of hard rock, heavy metal, stoner rock and psychedelic rock. They are often compared to influential classic rock and metal bands from the 1960s and 1970s, including Led Zeppelin, Black Sabbath, Blue Cheer and AC/DC. Frontman Stockdale has typically led songwriting for the group, although the material on the band's debut album was co-credited to Ross and Heskett. Stockdale also produced New Crown and performed bass on Victorious."@en ;

Miller, Conley and Prescott share singing and songwriting duties. In early years the band's recordings were all released on the small Boston-based record label Ace of Hearts. Despite initial success, Mission of Burma disbanded in 1983 due to Miller's development of tinnitus caused by the volume of the band's live performances. In its original lineup, the band released only two singles, an EP, and one LP, Vs. Mission of Burma reformed in 2002, with Bob Weston replacing Swope, and has since recorded four more albums, ONoffON, The Obliterati, The Sound The Speed The Light and Unsound."@en ;
