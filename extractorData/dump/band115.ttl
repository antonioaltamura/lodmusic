	dbo:abstract	"Aishah and The Fan Club, better known as The Fan Club or just Fan Club, were a New Zealand-based singing group in the late 1980s and early 1990s. The group released their first album Sensation in 1988, which spawned three top-20 singles in the New Zealand and Malaysian charts, namely \"Sensation\", \"Paradise\" and \"Call Me\" - the latter being a remake of a Spagna song of the same name. Their second album, titled Respect the Beat, also produced three hit singles, including \"I Feel Love\" and \"I Never Gave Up on You\", and the band's only single to make the US Billboard Hot 100 Charts - \"Don't Let Me Fall Alone\". The remixes for this song were among the most played dance tunes in clubs at the time. The group was formed while Wan Aishah binti Wan Ariffin was in New Zealand studying in the late 1980s. She was spotted by the other members of the group, and asked to join the band. Besides Aishah who sang lead vocals, the other members included Paul Moss on guitar and programming, Dave Larsen on drums, Glenn Peters on bass, Malcolm Smith on keyboards, and Hazri Yutim on second keyboard/synthesiser. Malcolm and Paul were also the main songwriters for the group. The band won the International Artist of the Year at the 1991 New Zealand Music Awards. Aishah remains popular in Malaysia and has released music in the Malay language. Paul Moss also lives in Malaysia where he has become a judge of the reality TV singing competitions Malaysian Idol and One in a Million."@en ;

They changed the writing of their name from Apollo 440 to Apollo Four Forty in 1996, though they switched back for their latest album. To date, Apollo's remixes number around 60 - from U2 in the early 1990s to Puff Daddy/Jimmy Page and Ennio Morricone a decade later.

	dbo:abstract	"Army of the Pharaohs (most commonly abbreviated as AOTP or A.O.T.P.) is an American underground hip hop collective originating from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, formed by Jedi Mind Tricks MC Vinnie Paz in 1998. The group has strong links to other underground groups such as; OuterSpace, Snowgoons, La Coka Nostra, Demigodz and Jedi Mind Tricks. It has changed several times since its formation. Paz formed the outfit in the late 1990s with the original roster of Bahamadia, Chief Kamachi, Virtuoso, 7L & Esoteric, plus Jedi Mind Tricks' other member Stoupe the Enemy of Mankind. The group first released the \"Five Perfect Exertions\" and \"War Ensemble\" 12\" on Paz's short-lived Recordings in 1998, but then the underground supergroup remained silent for several years. After a couple of successful Jedi Mind Tricks albums and a new deal with Babygrande by 2003, Paz resurrected the crew, adding OuterSpace, Celph Titled, Reef the Lost Cauze, King Syze, Des Devious, and Apathy; however, Stoupe, Bahamadia, and Virtuoso had defected from the group. Babygrande issued their \"Tear It Down\" 12\" and first album, The Torture Papers, in 2006. The 2007 follow-up album, Ritual of Battle, saw Jus Allah and JMT prot\u00E9g\u00E9s Doap Nixon and Demoz joining the Pharaohs. The Unholy Terror was released on March 30, 2010. This album marked the return of Apathy and the addition of two new AOTP members, Block McCloud Journalist. Two songs, \"Godzilla\" and \"Contra Mantra\", were released before the album. This album also marked the departure of Chief Kamachi who left the group because of business issues and an apparent feud with Vinnie Paz & Apathy. In early 2011, Vinnie Paz announced on his Facebook page that In Death Reborn is due to be released in 2012, however the date was pushed back and almost seemed like it was never going to be released. Early in 2012, Houston underground MC Zilla and Connecticut's Blacastan were added to the group. Both artists have made names for themselves with their features and album releases in 2012. In Death Reborn was eventually released on April 22, 2014. The album featured members Vinnie Paz, Apathy, Blacastan, Block McCloud, Celph Titled, Demoz, Des Devious, Doap Nixon, Esoteric, Lawrence Arnell, King Magnetic, King Syze, OuterSpace, Reef the Lost Cauze and Zilla. Their fifth studio album, Heavy Lies the Crown was released on October 21, 2014."@en ;

Phil Soussan and Bobby Borg left after the band\u2019s first album and after some light touring, and they are pictured on the album sleeve/liner notes and credited as having played on it. They released a video for the song \"Beggars & Thieves\" from their first album. After that album, Beggars & Thieves went through some personnel changes. Soussan left to put together a band and write for long time friend Vince Neil's first solo project and Borg left the band. Mancuso, Merlino and producer Barbiero decided to carry on without them. In 1991, a new three-person lineup was formed\u2014one that consisted of Louie Merlino on lead vocals, Mancuso on both bass and guitar and newcomer Bobby Chouinard on drums. And it was also in 1991 that Beggars & Thieves left Atlantic and signed with Epic. With that new Merlino/Mancuso/Chouinard lineup plus a new keyboardist called Alan St. John and producer Jim Vallance, the band recorded its second album\u2014which probably would have come out in 1991 or 1992 were it did not for office politics. Unfortunately, Beggars & Thieves got caught in the corporate crossfire at Epic, which dropped the band without releasing that second album. Finding themselves without a record deal, Beggars & Thieves didn't record for any more major labels in the \u201890s. And when Nirvana, Pearl Jam and the grunge movement exploded commercially in 1992 and 1993, the majors lost interest in the type of pop-metal/hard rock that Beggars & Thieves specialized in. Instead of looking for the next Axl Rose (Guns N' Roses) or the next Vince Neil (M\u00F6tley Cr\u00FCe), major label A&R people were looking for the next Kurt Cobain (Nirvana) or the next Eddie Vedder (Pearl Jam). But despite the commercial decline of pop-metal and hair bands, Beggars & Thieves kept plugging away. In 1997, Beggars & Thieves' second album, Look What You Create\u2014the one that Epic decided not to release--, was finally released independently on MTM Music (although it had limited distribution). Two years later, in 1999, again on MTM Music and again working with producer Jim Vallance, the band could release their third CD called The Grey Album, where drummer Sammy Mangiamele replaced Bobby Chouinard, who could not finish his work on that album. Sadly, drummer Bobby Chouinard died on March 8, 1997. Beggars and Thieves is still performing in 2011, most notably at Vamp'd Las Vegas. Singer Louie Merlino sings for the Vegas-based band Sin City Sinners when their usual singer Todd Kerns is touring with Slash. In December 2011 the new hardrock magnum opus We Are The Brokenhearted finally saw the light of day with a worldwide release on Frontiers Records. The hardrock album produced by R. Bernard Mann and mixed by famed engineer/songwriter Kevin Churko (Ozzy Osbourne, Five Finger Deathpunch) received fantastic reviews all over the world. The first videoclip from the album for the single \"We Come Undone\" excited with a guest appearance by legendary rock guitarist Jake E Lee. The second videoclip for the song \"Innocence\" was first introduced by AOL / Noisecreep in June. R. Bernard Mann is currently producing Jake E Lee's comeback album with Red Dragon Cartel, which also features Ron Mancuso on Bass guitar."@en ;

Several backing musicians also performed with the trio; however, these backing musicians were not officially part of Blackhawk until 2008. Prior to the group's formation, Robbins and Stephenson had co-written several Number One singles for the country pop band Restless Heart, and Stephenson had also charted two pop hits in the early 1980s. Paul was previously a member of the Southern rock band Outlaws as well. In 1993, Blackhawk was signed to a record deal with Arista Nashville. Their debut single, \"Goodbye Says It All\", was released that year, peaking at No. 11 on the Billboard Hot Country Singles & Tracks (now Hot Country Songs) charts, and their first album (1994's BlackHawk) was certified 2\u00D7 Multi-Platinum by the RIAA. Throughout the rest of the 1990s, the band continued to chart several singles, in addition to releasing three more albums and a Greatest Hits package. Van Stephenson departed the group in 2000 due to complications from skin cancer. He was replaced with Randy Threet (also a former member of the Outlaws), who made his first appearance on Spirit Dancer, the band's fifth studio album. After Threet's departure in 2003, Anthony Crawford took over as tenor vocalist and lead guitarist; Crawford was, in turn, succeeded by Michael Randall four years later. From early 2008 until he re-joined in 2010, Robbins left the group to resume his songwriting career, and Threet re-joined. Since then, BlackHawk's backing band has been subsumed into the main group, which comprises Paul (lead vocals, guitar, mandolin), Randy Threet (bass guitar, background vocals), Chris Anderson (lead guitar, background vocals), Dave Robbins (keyboards, background vocals), and Monte Yoho (drums, percussion)."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Breaking Benjamin is an American rock band from Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, founded in 1999 by lead singer and guitarist Benjamin Burnley and drummer Jeremy Hummel. The first lineup of the band also included guitarist Aaron Fink and bassist Mark Klepaski. This lineup released two albums, Saturate (2002) and We Are Not Alone (2004), before Hummel was replaced by Chad Szeliga in 2005. The band released two more studio albums, Phobia (2006) and Dear Agony (2009), before entering an extended hiatus in early 2010 due to Burnley's recurring illnesses. The release of a compilation album amid the hiatus, Shallow Bay: The Best of Breaking Benjamin (2011), unauthorized by Burnley, brought about legal trouble within the band resulting in the dismissal of Fink and Klepaski. Szeliga later announced his departure in 2013 citing creative differences. Burnley remained the sole member of the band until late 2014, when the current lineup was announced, including bassist and backing vocalist Aaron Bruch, guitarist and backing vocalist Keith Wallen, guitarist Jasen Rauch, and drummer Shaun Foist. The band afterward released Dark Before Dawn in 2015. Despite significant lineup changes, the band's musical style and lyrical content has remained consistent, with Burnley serving as the primary composer and lead vocalist since the band's inception. The band has commonly been noted for its formulaic hard rock tendencies with angst-heavy lyrics, swelling choruses, and \"crunching\" guitars. In the United States alone, the band has sold more than 7 million units and yielded three RIAA-certified platinum records, two gold records, and several certified singles, including one multi-platinum, three platinum, and three gold. The band has also produced one number one record on the Billboard 200."@en ;

They achieved instant attention with the dance routine which accompanied the song, involving a skirt-rip. The group went on to have a successful career around the world (albeit ignored in the United States), while the UK remained their biggest market, where they had three No.1 singles with \"Making Your Mind Up\" (1981), \"The Land of Make Believe\" (1981) and \"My Camera Never Lies\" (1982) and became one of the top-selling groups of the 1980s. They also had UK Top 10 hits with \"Now Those Days Are Gone\" (1982), \"If You Can't Stand the Heat\" (1982), \"When We Were Young\" (1983) and \"New Beginning (Mamba Seyra)\" (1986). Their worldwide record sales have exceeded 15 million. The line-up of the group has changed a number of times over the years, most famously when Jay Aston quit the group in 1985 and was replaced by Shelley Preston. Today, two versions of the group exist: the official version, which includes original member Bobby G, and a three-member version who tour under the name Cheryl Baker, Mike Nolan and Jay Aston, formerly of Bucks Fizz."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"The Cro-Mags are an American hardcore punk turned crossover thrash band from New York City. The band, which had a strong cult following, has released five studio albums, their first two considered the most influential. With a Hare Krishna background, they were among the first bands to fuse hardcore punk with thrash metal and were associated with the birth of a tougher attitude within the hardcore scene in the late 1980s, related to the world of martial arts. John Joseph McGowan and Harley Flanagan (formerly drummer for The Stimulators), are practitioners of boxing and Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu respectively. The Cro-Mags have gone through several line-up changes, and as of 2016, there are no constant members left in the band. According to AllMusic, \"before the Cro-Mags, the idea of combining heavy metal and hardcore together was unheard of. But with the release of their classic debut, The Age of Quarrel, hardcore-metal was born, and in its wake came a legion of similarly styled offspring (Biohazard, Vision of Disorder, etc.).\""@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Damageplan was an American heavy metal band from Dallas, Texas, formed in 2003. Following the demise of their previous group Pantera, brothers Dimebag Darrell and Vinnie Paul Abbott wanted to start a new band. The pair recruited former Diesel Machine and Halford guitarist Pat Lachman on vocals, and later Bob Zilla on bass. Damageplan released their only studio album New Found Power in the United States on February 10, 2004, which debuted at number 38 on the Billboard 200, selling 44,676 copies in its first week. While Damageplan was promoting the album at a concert on December 8, 2004, at the Alrosa Villa in Columbus, Ohio, a man named Nathan Gale climbed on stage and killed lead guitarist Darrell and three others, and wounding another seven, before being shot dead by police officer James Niggemeyer. Although no motive was found, some witnesses claimed Gale blamed the brothers for Pantera's breakup and believed that they had stolen his lyrics. The band's manager confirmed there are unreleased Damageplan recordings, although they have not surfaced, and the band has not performed since the incident. Abbott and Zilla have joined the band Hellyeah, and Lachman joined The Mercy Clinic."@en ;

Certain past and present members including Blackmoon, Ahriman, Caligula and Chaq Mol have each declared an affinity for Satanism, with Ahriman and Caligula notably being practitioners of LaVeyan Satanism. In their earlier years, their lyrical themes usually revolved specifically around depictions of Hell and Satan. After Emperor Magus Caligula joined the band, their lyrics came to focus more on blasphemy and anti-Christian rhetoric, although there have been several exceptions to this. The group have released six full-length albums and are one of the most prominent acts in the Swedish black metal scene."@en ;

dbr:Dave_Carter_and_Tracy_Grammer	rdf:type	dbo:Band ;
	foaf:name	"Dave Carter and Tracy Grammer"@en ;
	dbo:abstract	"Dave Carter and Tracy Grammer were an American folk duo who released three albums from 1998 to 2001, as well as additional material released after Dave Carter's death. The duo consisted of Dave Carter (songwriter, vocals, banjo, guitar, organ) and Tracy Grammer, (producer, vocals, violin, mandolin, guitar). Their work dealt with a number of themes, particularly Buddhist theology, Arthurian legend (and mythic themes in general), and the American west, often juxtaposed together in one song. In 2002, shortly before his death, Dave spoke of the duo's \"ever-burgeoning goddess repertoire\" as another lyric theme. One example of her admixture of themes may be found in the closing lines of \"Happytown,\" the first track from the album, Tanglewood Tree: parceval and valentino, ridin' winged palominoswillie in his el camino, on the runhere in the shining city, here in the endless summerhere in the cave of wonder, number ninety-twothe gods will lounge around until the show is throughbut it's all right, it's all right with me, if it's all right with you Their first album, When I Go, was actually released as a Dave Carter album \"with Tracy Grammer\" and Carter sang the lead vocals on all but one of the tracks, \"Kate and the Ghost of Lost Love,\" which was a duet. Produced by the duo, the album was recorded in Grammer's kitchen. Their second album, Tanglewood Tree, featured a more even split of singing duties, and was the first to actually be labeled as a Dave Carter and Tracy Grammer album. The album was described by Carter in an interview as \"the world's first Buddhist country album.\" Their third album (the last released before Carter's death), Drum Hat Buddha, maintained an even split between the two on lead vocals. This album met with considerable critical success, and the pair was considered by prominent reviewers to be one of the most promising new folk acts then active. In 2002, they toured the United States with folk legend Joan Baez, who described Carter's lyric writing as \"a kind of genius\" On July 19, 2002, Carter died of a massive heart attack while on tour in western Massachusetts. The impact on the folk music community was considerable; a substantial shrine was spontaneously created by fans and colleagues at the Falcon Ridge Folk Festival the following week. Grammer chose to attend the festival and perform without Carter; the festival organizers transformed the scheduled Dave and Tracy set into a tribute concert at which many of the performers at the festival sang Carter's songs, led by Grammer. Following Carter's death, Grammer went on to release a solo album, The Verdant Mile, the title track of which was her own tribute to Carter's memory and music. She followed this with Flower of Avalon, an album featuring nine previously unreleased songs by Carter. The album was produced by Grammer with John Jennings and featured harmonies by Mary Chapin Carpenter on many of the tracks - another testament to Carter's influence on folk music. In 2006, Grammer released another full-length Dave Carter and Tracy Grammer album, Seven Is the Number. The album consisted of a 2001\u20132002 re-recording by the duo of Carter's out-of-print solo project Snake Handlin' Man, with the addition of two previously unreleased songs, \"Seven Is the Number\" and \"Gas Station Girl\". 2007 saw the release of Grammer's latest album, Book of Sparrows, which contained two Dave Carter songs, as well as American Noel, a collection of holiday songs recorded by Dave Carter and Tracy Grammer, four of which were Carter originals. In February 2012, a new Carter and Grammer album, Little Blue Egg, was released by Red House Records. The material consists of eleven songs (ten of them Carter compositions) for which Carter had recorded vocals a decade or more earlier. Grammer found the tapes in their home and finished the songs herself."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Death Angel is an American thrash metal band from Daly City, California, initially active from 1982 to 1991 and again since 2001. Death Angel has released eight studio albums, two demo tapes, one box set and two live albums. The band has gone through several line-up changes, leaving guitarist Rob Cavestany as the only constant member; he and vocalist Mark Osegueda (who joined in 1984) are the only members of Death Angel to appear on all their releases (except for their 1983 demo Heavy Metal Insanity, which featured Cavestany on both guitar and vocals). Death Angel is often referred to as one of the key bands in the Bay Area thrash metal movement of the 1980s, and secured opening slots at club venues that decade, including opening for their peers Megadeth, Metallica, Slayer, Exodus, Testament (then-known as Legacy) and Possessed. The underground success of their first two studio albums, The Ultra-Violence (1987) and Frolic Through the Park (1988), attracted the attention of Geffen Records, who signed the quintet in 1989. Their 1990 follow-up album, Act III, was also successful. While Death Angel was touring in support of Act III, drummer Andy Galeon was injured in a tour bus accident and needed more than a year to fully recover. This resulted in the band's break up in 1991. However, Death Angel reformed in 2001 (without original guitarist Gus Pepa) at the Thrash of the Titans benefit concert for Testament singer Chuck Billy. The band has since continued to record and perform, and their recent studio album, The Evil Divide, was released in 2016."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Dimension Zero is a melodic death metal band based in Gothenburg, Sweden. It was formed in 1995 as a side project by In Flames' former guitarists Jesper Str\u00F6mblad and Glenn Ljungstr\u00F6m. The former Marduk drummer and vocalist Jocke Gothberg joined later on vocals, as well as Hans Nilsson (ex-Liers in Wait, Diabolique, Crystal Age) on drums. The band released Penetrations from the Lost World in 1997 before splitting up the following year. They reformed in 2000, and later recorded Silent Night Fever and This Is Hell. Tours have been rare due to members' other musical commitments. Musically, they have been described as strictly old-school Swedish death metal in the range of At the Gates, Unleashed and Defleshed. Because of Dimension Zero's inception by In Flames' lead guitarist, Jesper Str\u00F6mblad, their albums have drawn critical comparisons with some of In Flames' earlier work. Their latest album, He Who Shall Not Bleed, was released in 2007. In May 2014, it was announced that the band would reunite for the Gothenburg Sound Festival, which was set to take place in January 2015. In November 2014, a video message from vocalist Jocke on Gothenburg Sound's official Facobook page announced that Dimension Zero had been forced to cancel due to \"family circumstances\" and was replaced by Jesper Str\u00F6mblad's new band The Resistance.

	dbo:abstract	"In 1988, a thrash metal band by the name of Siren\u2019s Yell was formed in the Swedish town of Str\u00F6mstad. Its members were Jon N\u00F6dtveidt, Ole \u00D6hman, Peter Palmdahl, and Mattias \u201CM\u00E4be\u201D Johansson. The group recorded a single demo before breaking up in 1989. N\u00F6dtveidt joined the band Rabbit\u2019s Carrot, where \u00D6hman played drums. N\u00F6dtveidt and \u00D6hman \u201Cwere never very comfortable in Rabbit's Carrot, which also explains their short time in that band, as they wanted the music and lyrics to evolve on the extreme dark side. Jon would write songs and arrange them together with Ole in the rehearsal place, but the other members, didn't feel that the material would fit the band.\u201D In autumn 1989, Jon N\u00F6dtveidt formed Dissection together with Palmdahl on bass. In the spring of 1990, they recruited drummer \u00D6hman. In April 1990, the first official rehearsal tape Severed into Shreds was recorded and sent to underground fanzines worldwide \u201Cto mark the birth of DISSECTION, a band that was about to make heavy impact on the scene\u201D. The band recruited former Siren\u2019s Yell bassist Mattias \u201CM\u00E4be\u201D Johansson, who was now playing with the local death/thrash metal band Nosferatu, as a live session member playing the rhythm guitar. Dissection\u2019s first concert was held in October 1990 with death metal act Entombed. In December 1990, the band recorded and released the demo The Grief Prophecy. It contained three songs and featured illustrations by the artist known as Necrolord, who later created most Dissection album artworks. In January 1991, second guitarist John Zwetsloot joined the band, which now had a complete line-up \u201Cand could further develop their characteristic dual-harmony guitar-sound that was to become an important part of the band's sound\u201D. The first concert with Zwetsloot was held in February 1991 at a local death metal event in the band\u2019s hometown Str\u00F6mstad. As the demo was spreading in the underground scene, the French record label Corpsegrinder Records offered Dissection a deal to record an EP. In April 1991, Dead, the notorious Norwegian black metal group Mayhem\u2019s vocalist, committed suicide. A few days later, Dissection played the Mayhem song Freezing Moon in honour of Dead at a show in Falkenberg, Sweden, and made an unofficial special edition of the The Grief Prophecy demo with a cover drawn by Dead. In September 1991 the band record three new tracks for the 7\u201D EP Into Infinite Obscurity, released in December 1991 by Corpsegrinder Records in a limited edition of 1000 copies. In December 1991 N\u00F6dtveidt and \u00D6hman also played live in Askim, Norway, at a black metal concert arranged by the Norwegian Black Circle N\u00F6dtveidt had joined, and Euronymous, who led the Circle and the band Mayhem. N\u00F6dtveidt, \u00D6hman and Euronymous performed Freezing Moon live. In 1992 Dissection recorded a four-track promo tape and signed a one-album deal with No Fashion Records. In March 1993, the band recorded the full-length album The Somberlain, recorded and mixed at Hellspawn/Unisound studios with Dan Swan\u00F6. During that time, the band\u2019s members, who were temporarily living in different towns, all moved to Gothenburg after the summer of 1993, where they shared a steady rehearsal place with At the Gates. The album was released in December 1993 and dedicated to Euronymous, who had been murdered earlier the same year. As the band members \u201Cwould find themselves rehearsing more and more without John [Zwetsloot] even showing up\u201D and \u201Ceven had to cancel gigs because he didn't show up for the preparing rehearsals\u201D, they \u201Cfelt they had their hands tied behind their backs with John still in the band and that they could do nothing but kick him out\u201D. The last concert with Zwetsloot was performed in Oslo, Norway, on 14 April 1994. The day Zwetsloot was fired, Dissection called Johan Norman from Satanized (a short-lived project N\u00F6dtveidt was involved with), who showed up one day later and \u201Cproved to be a worthy replacement for John, having the motivation that John was lacking\u201D. Dissection continued playing live, wrote songs for a second album, and entered the studio twice to record demos of new songs and the contribution Anti-Christ for the Slayer tribute compilation album Slatanic Slaughter on Black Sun Records. In November 1994, Dissection signed a deal with Nuclear Blast and focussed on the second album. In March 1995, the band returned to the Hellspawn/Unisound studios to record the second full-length album Storm of the Light's Bane, followed by a three date tour through the UK with Cradle of Filth and a few concerts in Sweden. During the summer of 1995 N\u00F6dtveidt and Norman joined the newly formed Satanic organization Misanthropic Luciferian Order (MLO). In September 1995 drummer Ole \u00D6hman left Dissection and was replaced by Tobias Kellgren (ex-Satanized). He was introduced to the Swedish fans at a show with Morbid Angel at K\u00E5ren in Gothenburg, the 10th of October 1995. In November 1995, Storm of the Light\u2019s Bane was released by Nuclear Blast, followed by a two-week European tour through Germany, Austria, Czech Republic, Switzerland and Sweden in December 1995, and the World Tour of the Light\u2019s Bane covering Europe and America, ending in 1997. By the beginning of January 1996, Dissection was playing shows in Sweden before leaving for a UK tour with At the Gates in February, followed by a vast US tour with At the Gates and Morbid Angel in March. Back in Scandinavia, Dissection played at the Rockefeller in Oslo together with Darkthrone and Satyricon, marking the start of a co-headlining European tour. In April, in connection with the co-headlining European tour, Dissection released the Where Dead Angels Lie MCD, which contained the title track\u2019s studio and demo version as well as other demo recordings and two cover songs. In 1997, Dissection played the Gods of Darkness tour together with Cradle of Filth, In Flames and Dimmu Borgir. Dissection\u2019s and Dimmu Borgir\u2019s show at the Live Music Hall in Cologne, Germany, on 31 March 1997, was recorded and released by Nuclear Blast on the live split video cassette Live & Plugged Vol. II. Dissection\u2019s World Tour of the Light's Bane ended with an appearance at the Wacken Open Air festival, which was recorded and released on the Live Legacy album, and the Nuclear Blast festivals. Although \"[t]he first era of DISSECTION was now at its peak\" and \"the situation, at least on the surface, seemed to be stable and prosperous with the band's success peaking, personal differences prevailed\". This resulted in Palmdahl leaving the band and being replaced by Jon N\u00F6dtveidt's brother Emil N\u00F6dtveidt for the summer festivals. After the summer Norman \"suddenly 'disappeared' for several months without notice, with Tobias covering up for him claiming to know nothing (however remaining in close contact with Johan throughout this period). The background of this 'disappearance' being that Johan had turned his back on and betrayed the MLO, fearing their retribution.\" As N\u00F6dtveidt was a member of MLO, Norman had also left Dissection behind, N\u00F6dtveidt being the only member left in the band. He recruited a new line-up and booked the Studio Fredman for the supposed recording of the third studio album."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Dragon is a rock band which was formed in Auckland, New Zealand, in January 1972 and relocated later to Sydney, Australia in May 1975. They were originally fronted by singer Marc Hunter and are currently led by his brother, bass player/vocalist Todd Hunter. They performed and released material under the name Hunter in Europe and the United States during 1987. Keyboard player Paul Hewson wrote or co-wrote most of the group's 1970s hits: \"April Sun in Cuba\" peaked at #2 on the 1977 Australian singles chart; \"Are You Old Enough?\" reached #1 in 1978; and \"Still in Love with You\" reached #15 also in 1978. Later hits, from when the band re-grouped in the 1980s, were written by other band members, often working with outside associates: The Hunter brothers, with Todd's partner, Johanna Pigott, wrote \"Rain,\" a #2 hit in 1983, while other, more minor hits were written by the Hunters and/or Alan Mansfield, frequently in collaboration with any combination of Pigott, Mansfield's partner Sharon O'Neill, Marc Hunter's partner Wendy Hunter, or producers Todd Rundgren and David Hirschfelder. The name Dragon came from a consultation of I Ching cards by early band vocalist Graeme Collins. Dragon have endured tragedy, adversity and notoriety, and during the course of the band's earlier career, several members died from drug-related causes. Problems began soon after their arrival in Sydney in late 1975, when all their equipment was stolen. Several months later, in 1976, drummer Neil Storey died of a heroin overdose; Paul Hewson of a drug overdose in 1985 and Marc Hunter of smoking-related oesophageal cancer in 1998. Several members of the group including Hewson and Marc Hunter were heavy heroin users during the band's heyday, and The Stewart Royal Commission (1980\u20131983) which investigated the Mr. Asia drug syndicate obtained evidence that Dragon members were clients. Two members were involved in a serious car crash in 1977, where Paul Hewson's neck was in a brace as well as having a broken arm and Robert Taylor needed plastic surgery, and Hewson also suffered from debilitating scoliosis and arthritis, the pain of which reportedly contributed to his heroin use. The band also undertook a famously disastrous 1978 tour of the USA, supporting Johnny Winter, which ended when Marc Hunter abused the Texan audience as \"faggots\" and the band were pelted off stage, while Winter's band were said to have taken bets about how long it would be before Hunter was shot. On 1 July 2008, the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) recognised Dragon's iconic status when they were inducted into the ARIA Hall of Fame."@en ;

Tamir \"Nokio\" Ruffin was the group's founder; his groupmates included lead singer Mark \"Sisq\u00F3\" Andrews, Larry \"Jazz\" Anthony, and James \"Woody Rock\" Green. Signing to Island Records through Haqq Islam's University Records imprint, the group released two successful albums, Dru Hill and Enter the Dru, before separating for a period from late 1999 to 2002, during which time Sisq\u00F3 and Woody released solo albums. While Woody's Soul Music LP was a moderate success in the gospel music industry, Sisq\u00F3's debut album, Unleash the Dragon, and its hit single, \"Thong Song\", were major pop successes, and established Sisq\u00F3 as a household name outside of Dru Hill. Sisq\u00F3's second album, Return of Dragon, did not sell as well. In 2002, by then part of the Def Soul record label, the group reunited and added fifth member Rufus \"Scola\" Waller to the lineup for their third album, Dru World Order, whose underperformance led to the group being dropped from Def Soul. In 2009, the group signed to Kedar Entertainment Group and released their fourth album, InDRUpendence Day, the following year, with new member Tao taking the place of the again departed Woody."@en ;

Posthumus was an independent music group that produced a form of 21st-century classical music/epic music that intertwined popular style drum rhythms with orchestral and electronic sounds. Their music is inspired by the Pythagorean philosophy which states that \"music is the harmonization of opposites; the conciliation of warring elements\". The E.S. is an acronym for \"Experimental Sounds\" while Posthumus (Latin: postumus, meaning \"after\" or \"end\") is a word that is meant to represent \"all things past\", suggesting the music was inspired by things that have ended, some time after they ended. The group was formed in 2000 by brothers Helmut and Franz Vonlichten. Helmut and Franz studied piano with their mother. After graduating from high school, Franz worked in recording studios while Helmut attended and graduated from UCLA, with a degree in archaeology. Their music has been licensed by many movie and television production studios, being included in numerous movie trailers and television shows. E.S. Posthumus released three albums overall in their career. On July 22, 2010, it was officially announced that Franz had died about two months before. After giving notice of his brother's death, Helmut stated that while there still may be one or two unreleased songs (one of them being their single \"Christmas Eve\" released in November 2010), the group would no longer be active. In November 2011, it was officially announced that Helmut Vonlichten had formed a new band called Les Friction, and released a preview of his new work with a track called \"Torture\"."@en ;

The group achieved 18 Top 20 singles and four Top 10 albums, and were one of the UK's most popular boy bands during the early to mid-1990s, aided by strong tabloid interest in their 'bad boy' image compared to the 'clean cut' image of rivals Take That. Their style blended pop and rap in songs such as \"House of Love\" and \"Let It Rain\".

After Brainiac, Schmersal made a solo album under the name John Stuart Mill. Rick Lee and Steve Calhoon were both previous members of the band Skeleton Key, a befriended band Brainiac had toured with. Together they formed Enon. Lee created a number of percussion sounds for the band playing a \"junk kit\" including a Radio Flyer wagon, propane tank, and old hubcaps. After the release of their first album Believo! which was Produced by D. Sardy and signed to his SeeThru Broadcasting label in 1999, Calhoon left the band and was replaced by Toko Yasuda (bass/vocals/keyboard) and Matt Schulz (drums). Yasuda was previously in the bands Blonde Redhead, The Lapse and The Van Pelt. With the new lineup, Enon released High Society also produced by Sardy in 2002 and toured with The Faint. A majority of Enon's albums have been released on the Chicago-based indie label, Touch and Go Records after the closing of SeeThru Broadcasting. Lee left the band, and Enon went on to release Hocus Pocus in 2003, and a collection of singles and previously difficult to find internet-released songs with a bonus DVD entitled Lost Marbles & Exploded Evidence in February 2005. In 2007, all three members of Enon contributed to Les Savy Fav's album Let's Stay Friends. Yasuda also did vocal contributions to previous recordings of this band, e.g. the first track of The Cat and the Cobra. Enon released their fourth and final studio album, Grass Geysers...Carbon Clouds on Touch and Go Records on October 9, 2007. In summer 2008, drummer Matt Schulz announced that he would be leaving the group to pursue other interests. Afterwards he joined Holy Fuck as a touring member. Brainiac's former bassist, Monasterio, directs music videos, including two for Enon, and released an album in 2008 with a new band called Model/Actress; Schmersal makes appearances on this album."@en ;

In November 2000, they recorded their second album, \"Megalomania\", accompanied by drummer Asgeir Mickelson (Borknagar/Spiral Architect) and bass player Hans-Aage Holmen.

	dbo:abstract	"Fates Warning is an American progressive metal band, formed in 1982 by vocalist John Arch, guitarists Jim Matheos and Victor Arduini, bassist Joe DiBiase, and drummer Steve Zimmerman in Hartford, Connecticut. Their early work was heavily influenced by NWOBHM, and was key in the development of American power metal. With each work the band developed into a pure progressive metal style. Fates Warning has experienced numerous line-up changes. From 1982 to 1996 \u2014 and temporarily in 2010 \u2014 Matheos and DiBiase were the only remaining original members of the band, with Matheos being the only constant member. Their current lineup consists of guitarists Jim Matheos and Frank Aresti, vocalist Ray Alder, bassist Joey Vera, and drummer Bobby Jarzombek. As a pioneer of the American progressive metal movement, Fates Warning rose to international fame in the 1980s and was ranked as one of the early \"flagship bands of progressive metal\" along with Queensr\u00FFche, Dream Theater, Crimson Glory and Watchtower, who were responsible for creating, developing and popularizing that genre. Fates Warning has released twelve studio albums, two live albums, one compilation album, one VHS, three DVDs (each of them features live concerts) and four demo tapes. The band experienced major American commercial success with the 1986 release of their third studio album, Awaken the Guardian, which peaked at number No. 191 on the Billboard 200, and became the first album released on Metal Blade to enter that chart. Their next three albums, No Exit (1988), Perfect Symmetry (1989) and Parallels (1991), were also successful; the first two peaked at No. 111 and No. 141 on the Billboard 200 respectively. Fates Warning's most recent studio album, Theories of Flight, was released on July 1, 2016."@en ;

The band's history is riddled with a 'revolving door' lineup with 13 the only member to have never been replaced. After breaking up in 2001 when Wednesday 13 left to perform vocals with the Murderdolls, the band reformed for a brief reunion in 2005, releasing a box set containing their entire library of recordings except for the track \"Look Mom I Killed A Chicken\" because Wednesday 13's master copy was \"destroyed beyond repair\". This track is exclusively available on the 197666 7-inch LP and the band-released \"Chop off My Hand\" CD-R. The music of the Frankenstein Drag Queens was played in a punk rock style. Lyrically the band were inspired by horror B-movies and references in popular culture. As well as a large leaning towards punk the band's live show and appearance took cues from glam rock acts such as Alice Cooper, New York Dolls and KISS. They were known to wear dresses and make-up on stage as part of their performance."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"From First to Last is an American rock band based in Arizona, originally from the Los Angeles Area, Illinois and Tampa, Florida. The current line-up consists of bassist Matt Manning, guitarists Matt Good, Travis Richter and Taylor Larson and drummer Derek Bloom. The band released their first EP titled Aesthetic in 2003 which they recorded with founding member and vocalist Phillip Reardon who left the band in 2004 due to personal and creative differences. Dear Diary, My Teen Angst Has a Body Count followed in 2004 and Heroine in 2006, both with former vocalist Sonny Moore. Following the departure of Moore in February 2007 to work on his solo electronic project, Skrillex, the band added permanent bassist Matt Manning, and Matt Good moved to lead vocals/guitar. They released a self-titled album in 2008 on Suretone Records. On August 27, 2009, From First to Last confirmed on DJ Rossstar's Punk Rock Show that they have indeed left Suretone and are now signed to Rise Records. In late 2009, they parted ways with longtime guitarist/vocalist Travis Richter. Their fourth studio album, Throne to the Wolves was released on March 16, 2010. On July 28, 2010, the band entered a hiatus. In November 2013, From First to Last reformed after 3 years of hiatus and launched a Kickstarter campaign to fund the recording of a new EP with the return of guitarist/vocalist Travis Richter who had left the band in 2009. In April 2014 Richter and Good made a video announcement and re-recorded track teaser \"The Latest Plague\" from Heroine (2006) via Alternative Press with Periphery vocalist Spencer Sotelo confirming that Spencer was the new lead vocalist to feature on the band's upcoming second EP. In the latter part of May 2014 the new line up released a remake of the song \"Note to Self\" from Dear Diary, My Teen Angst Has a Body Count to commemorate the 10-year anniversary of the album. On January 13, 2015 the band released their eponymous lead single, \"Dead Trees\", from their recently released fifth album. The album was released on April 27, 2015 under the record label Sumerian Records as a LP and not an EP."@en ;

The band was known for the complexity and sophistication of its music and for the varied musical skills of its members. All of the band members, except Malcolm Mortimore, were multi-instrumentalists. Although not commercially successful, they did achieve a cult following. The band's onetime stated aim was to \"expand the frontiers of contemporary popular music at the risk of becoming very unpopular\", although this stance was to alter significantly with time. Gentle Giant's music was considered complex even by progressive rock standards, drawing on a broad swath of music including folk, soul, jazz, and classical music. Unlike many of their progressive rock contemporaries, their \"classical\" influences ranged beyond the Romantic and incorporated medieval, baroque, and modernist chamber music elements. The band also had a taste for broad themes for their lyrics, drawing inspiration not only from personal experiences but from philosophy and the works of both Fran\u00E7ois Rabelais and R. D. Laing. In 2015 they were recognised with the lifetime achievement award at the Progressive Music Awards."@en ;

The band's name comes from The Gore Gore Girls, a 1972 B-movie by Herschell Gordon Lewis, which is a parody of the term Go Go Girls. Like fellow Detroit bands The White Stripes and The Detroit Cobras, the band started out struggling through the local club circuit before being \"discovered\" by independent record label Get Hip Records in 1998. Their first single \"Mama in the Movies\" (1999) gained favourable airplay on college radio stations in Michigan, which led to recording their first full-length album Strange Girls in (2000). The second album Up All Night, was released in 2002 and received positive press from the Village Voice and Detroit Free Press. During this time the band toured Europe twice, in 2002 and in 2003, also with infrequent dates in the United States. The band became a four-piece in 2004 with the addition of The Hammer (Marlene Hammerle) on guitar and began touring the United States extensively. Gore Gore Girls toured as direct support for The Cramps in 2003 and 2004. The band released an EP in 2004, 7 X 4, which became part of their third album, Get the Gore. Tracks from the EP and subsequent third album received airplay on Little Steven's Underground Garage Program on Sirius Satellite Radio; the band was featured at Little Steven's Underground Garage Festival on Randall's Island, New York along with other 'garage rock' luminaries and legends The Stooges, The Strokes, The New York Dolls, The Zombies and others. Get the Gore, released in 2007 on Bloodshot Records, was recorded at Ghetto Recorders in Detroit, Michigan and received positive press from USA Today and Playboy Magazine. Gore Gore Girls toured Europe again in spring of 2008, the band's third tour of Scandinavia and Western European countries."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Grupo Niche is a salsa group founded in 1978 in Cali, Colombia. Currently based in Cali, Colombia, it enjoys great popularity throughout Latin America. It was founded by Jairo Varela and Alexis Lozano. Varela remained with the group until his death in 2012, becoming producer, director, songwriter, vocalist and guiro player. Alexis Lozano, trombone player and arranger later left to form Orquesta Guayac\u00E1n. It also included Nicolas Cristancho, on the piano; Francisco Garcia, on the bass; Luis Pacheco, on the congas; as well as vocalists Jorge Baz\u00E1n and Hector Viveros. Grupo Niche's first album: \"Al Pasito\" was released in 1980, did little to challenge the dominating salsa band of Colombia at the time, Fruko y sus Tesos. The following year, however, the group found success with their second album, \"Querer es Poder\", particularly with the single \"Buenaventura y Caney\". The group relocated in 1982 to Cali where they have been based since. After recording two more albums, Grupo Niche released \"No Hay Quinto Malo\" in 1984, which featured their signature song, \"Cali Pachanguero\". The tribute hit single to the \"world salsa capital\" catapulted Niche as one of the top salsa bands of Colombia. In 1986, the band incorporated Puerto Rican vocalist Tito Gomez, who had previously worked with the famous Puerto Rican salsa group, la Sonora Ponce\u00F1a, and Ray Barretto, the Godfather of Latin Jazz. Later that year, Grupo Niche released \"Me Huele a Matrimonio\". Afterward, yet another Puerto Rican joined, the pianist Israel Tanenbaum, who would eventually leave the group to join a Niche spin-off band: Orquesta Guayac\u00E1n. Grupo Niche is known for both its vigorous, uptempo dance music as well as slower-paced romantic numbers. Among its best known hits are \"Cali Aji\", \"Del Puente Pa'll\u00E1\", \"Sin Sentimientos\", \"Una Aventura\", \"Etnia\", \"Gotas de Lluvia\", \"Han Cogido la Cosa\", \"Mi Pueblo Natal\", \"Hagamos Lo Que Diga Coraz\u00F3n\", \"Duele Mas\", \"Nuestro Sue\u00F1o\", and the famous cumbia \"Canoa Rancha\".Their most famous song is \"Cali Pachanguero\". Some other singers from Niche throughout its history include Alvaro del Castillo, La Coco Lozano, Tuto Jim\u00E9nez, Saulo Sanchez, Tito Gomez, Moncho Santana, Charlie Cardona as well as Willy Garcia and Javier Vasquez, now members of the group 'Son de Cali'. Most recently joined are the Puerto Ricans Oswaldo Roman and Julio Lopez and actual singer Elvis Magno from Buenaventura. They have been very successful, and some of their songs are considered Classics of Salsa Music. The group still enjoys some of its past successes, and keeps on tour, making worldwide presentations, and singing their most memorable songs. Musician Tito Gomez, who fronted the group for seven and half years (1985\u20131992), died on June 12, 2007 in Cali, the city of the Grupo Niche where he had stablished."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Gwar, often styled as GWAR, is an American heavy metal/hardcore punk band formed in Richmond, Virginia in 1984, composed of and operated by a frequently rotating line-up of musicians, artists and filmmakers collectively known as Slave Pit Inc.. Following the death of frontman and lead singer Dave Brockie in 2014, the group has continued without any original members, although Don Drakulich, a non-instrument-performing member of the collective, has been with the band since 1985. Easily identified by their distinctively grotesque costumes, Gwar's core thematic and visual concept revolves around an elaborate science fiction-themed mythology which portrays the band members as barbaric interplanetary warriors, a narrative which serves as the basis for all of the band's albums, videos, live shows and other media. Rife with over-the-top violent, sexual, and scatological humour typically incorporating social and political satire, Gwar have attracted both acclaim and controversy for their music and stage shows, the latter of which notoriously showcase enactments of graphic violence that result in the audience being sprayed with copious amounts of fake blood, urine, and semen. Such stagecraft regularly leads Gwar to be labeled a \"shock rock\" band by the media. Since their formation, Gwar have released thirteen studio albums, two live albums, and numerous singles among other recordings, and have sold over 820,000 records in the United States. Fueled largely by the controversies surrounding their concerts, Gwar experienced brief mainstream notoriety during the first half of the 1990s, receiving regular airplay on MTV as well as frequent in-character guest appearances on daytime talk shows, satirizing the topics of censorship and media violence. Though the band's mainstream popularity declined by the end of the 1990s, Gwar has retained a dedicated cult following. The band's extensive videography consists of both live recordings and long-form feature films, most notably 1992's Phallus in Wonderland, which earned a Grammy Award nomination for Best Long Form Music Video. Outside of music and video, Gwar has expanded their franchise into comic books, trading cards, a board game, signature beers, barbecue sauces, and e-liquids."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Henry Cow were an English avant-rock group, founded at Cambridge University in 1968 by multi-instrumentalists Fred Frith and Tim Hodgkinson. Henry Cow's personnel fluctuated over their decade together, but drummer Chris Cutler and bassoonist/oboist Lindsay Cooper were important long-term members alongside Frith and Hodgkinson. An inherent anti-commercial attitude kept them at arm's length from the mainstream music business, enabling them to experiment at will. Critic Myles Boisen writes, \"their sound was so mercurial and daring that they had few imitators, even though they inspired many on both sides of the Atlantic with a blend of spontaneity, intricate structures, philosophy, and humor that has endured and transcended the 'progressive' tag.\" While it was generally thought that Henry Cow took their name from 20th-century American composer Henry Cowell, this has been repeatedly denied by band members. According to Hodgkinson, the name \"Henry Cow\" was \"in the air\" in 1968, and it seemed like a good name for the band. It had no connection to anything."@en ;

Susmit Sen, Asheem Chakravarty, Rahul Ram and Amit Kilam were band members till Chakravarty's death on 25 December 2009, after which Tuheen Chakravorty and Himanshu Joshi were officially inducted into the band as replacements. After the departure of Susmit Sen in 2013, Rahul Ram is the only founding member who appeared on the band's debut album Indian Ocean. The musical style of the band can be at best classified as jazz fusion and fusion music. It is an experimental genre, fusing raga (traditional Indian tunes) with rock music, guitars and drums, sometimes using Indian folk songs. It has also been described by some music critics as \"Indo-rock fusion with jazz-spiced rhythms that integrates shlokas, sufism, environmentalism, mythology and revolution\". Since 2010, the band has moved against the lines of record labels. They released their latest album 16/330 Khajoor Road online for free. The main reason for this move was the frustration over negotiating contracts with record companies and fighting over copyright issues. They have turned to concerts and sponsorships for generating revenue rather than playing in the hands of record labels. For a brief amount of time they had the sponsorship of Johnnie Walker. They are also a part of the world's first Music Personalisation Initiative named DRP as one of the five Featured Artists. In its 2014 listing of \"25 Greatest Indian Rock Songs of the last 25 Years\", \"Rolling Stone India\" featured two songs, Ma Rewa and Kandisa from the album, Kandisa (2000)."@en ;

Formed by guitarist Graham Lambert and singer Stephen Holt, the latter of which departed the band prior to the band signing with Mute Records, the band's sound was characterised by the use of organ playing and distorted guitars. The band both preceded and was a part of the late 1980s and early 1990s Madchester movement. In 2011, Tom Hingley, who featured on all of the band's studio albums during their original run, departed the band. Hingley and Boon gave conflicting accounts of his departure, with Hingley stating that he had been sacked and Boon stating that he had chosen to leave. The band continued, re-uniting with Stephen Holt who sang on the band's early material."@en ;

Following a period of several years working behind the scenes in music production, multi-instrumentalist and producer/engineer Piet Sielck joined with former Helloween bandmate Kai Hansen and then-drummer for Blind Guardian Thomen Stauch in a new project that would blend power metal with a high-concept science fiction story. The band's debut album Iron Savior introduced the story that would be told over the course of multiple albums, featuring a self-aware space vessel called the Iron Savior and its relationship to the mythical lost civilization of Atlantis. Critics have compared Iron Savior's sound and musical approach to classic heavy metal bands like Judas Priest, Iron Maiden, and Queensr\u00FFche. Kai Hansen's presence in the band brought to the Iron Savior albums on which he appeared a style heavily influenced by Gamma Ray and Helloween. Since its inception, Iron Savior has released nine studio albums, two EPs, two singles and one live album. Despite numerous lineup changes, Piet has continued to direct the band and is currently the only remaining founding member."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Karate was an American band, formed in Boston, Massachusetts in 1993 by Geoff Farina, Eamonn Vitt and Gavin McCarthy. In 1995, Jeff Goddard joined the band as bass player, and Vitt moved to second guitar. Vitt departed Karate to pursue a medical career in 1997. The band was characterised by their love for improvised music and classic rock and their adherence to the DIY punk ethos of their youth, which made them difficult to classify, being a strange fusion of indie rock, punk, blues, jazz and post-rock. Farina developed hearing problems due to twelve years of performance with Karate and was forced to disband the group in July 2005, quietly closing the door on a 12-year run that included 6 studio albums and almost 700 performances in 20 countries. Their final show was played in Rome, Italy, on July 10, 2005. Their music was primarily released on Southern Records. Karate\u2019s perfectionism and attention to detail is well known among the music scene. Their compulsive behaviour manifested also in naming their last recording, which was originally called \u201C594\u201D since it was believed to be a recording of their 594th show. When Gavin discovered a flyer for a forgotten early show that had somehow evaded Jeff\u2019s memory, the band quickly changed the title to \u2018595\u2019. Finally, In 2007, the former band members decided to release the live album 595. Often, Karate was sent live material from their own performances (often from sound technicians). This happened also after their performance on May 5 at Stuk, Leuven, Belgium. Karate was so astonished by the quality of the recording they decided to release this \"posthumous\" live album of their 595th live performance. On his own, Geoff Farina has also developed a solo career with three albums and a handful of EPs over the years, some released while the band was still around, and thus far one since Karate disbanded."@en ;

Toby Driver is the only founding member of the band still remaining, save for frequent lyrical contributions from former motW member Jason Byron, culminating in a guest track on the Hubardo album. Up until 2011, the lineup was constantly shifting, and Kayo Dot's sound consistently changed over the years, featuring a wide variety of instrumentation featuring guitar, drums, bass, violin, saxophone, vibraphone, synthesizers, clarinets and flutes. Underground metal audiences warmly received the group upon its early existence, with the 2003 album Choirs of the Eye and the 2006 album Dowsing Anemone with Copper Tongue both becoming underground hits in the progressive metal scene. Over the years, in addition to the rotating lineup and constantly changing sounds, Kayo Dot has been signed to a number of different record labels, Tzadik, Robotic Empire, Hydra Head before taking to Kickstarter and pre-orders to crowdfund their albums, as to be free of record label interference. The group signed to The Flenser in 2014. As of 2016, Kayo Dot has released eight studio albums, one EP and one split: Choirs of the Eye in 2003, Dowsing Anemone with Copper Tongue as well as Kayo Dot/Bloody Panda Split in 2006, Blue Lambency Downward, Coyote in 2010, an EP titled Stained Glass in 2011, Gamma Knife in 2012 and a double-album Hubardo in 2013.

	dbo:abstract	"Leb i sol (Macedonian: \u041B\u0435\u0431 \u0438 \u0441\u043E\u043B) is a Macedonian rock group founded in the 1970s by Vlatko Stefanovski (guitar), Bodan Arsovski (bass guitar), Nikola Kokan Dimu\u0161evski (keyboards) and Garabet Tavitjan (drums). Tavitjan ceded the drumwork to Dragoljub \u0110uri\u010Di\u0107 for some of the albums, while Kiril D\u017Eajkovski replaced Kokan on Kao Kakao and Putujemo. Beside being the most eminent Macedonian band, they were also one of the most important acts of the former Yugoslav Rock scene. \"Leb i sol\" is a traditional greeting which literally translates to \"bread and salt\". It is often used as an expression of spite or determination; e.g. \"I will eat bread and salt if I have to, but I will not give in!\", but that has nothing to do with the band's name. More commonly, distinguished visitors to villages and communities would be offered a piece of home-baked bread and a dip of salt as a traditional welcome, which is where the name of the band really came from. Their music combined elements of rock, jazz fusion and ethnic Macedonian music. As the band matured, the jazz influences became less obvious. However, in concert, Leb i sol performances of jazzed-up and lengthy versions of traditional ethno-folk classics such as \"Jovano Jovanke\" or \"Aber Dojde Donke\", were often received with great enthusiasm and cheer. Leb i sol were very popular in the 1970s and 1980s and, while not selling as many records as some pop and folk acts, were very well known and respected and often sold-out venues in most of the larger cities in the former Yugoslavia. The first two albums are often considered foundational, while most are diverse enough to be, at least in part, accessible to a fairly wide audience. The influence of ethnic music and folk music of Republic of Macedonia are recognizable in the use of odd meters (5/4, 7/8) and non-traditional scales (e.g. the Phrygian dominant scale). While all the musicians were fairly accomplished, Vlatko Stefanovski is frequently regarded as an exceptional guitar virtuoso."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Living Loud was a recording project featuring bass player and songwriter Bob Daisley, Uriah Heep drummer Lee Kerslake, guitarist Steve Morse of Deep Purple and Cold Chisel singer Jimmy Barnes. Deep Purple keyboards player Don Airey made a guest appearance. According to the liner notes of the self-titled album, the project was instigated by Daisley who had discussed with Kerslake the possibility of \"re-doing some of the songs from the classic rock albums that they had co-written\". Six of those songs, \"I Don't Know\", \"Crazy Train\", \"Flying High Again\", \"Mr. Crowley\", \"Tonight\" and \"Over the Mountain\" originally appeared on the Ozzy Osbourne albums Blizzard of Ozz and Diary of a Madman. In 2002, Osbourne had re-issued both albums with Daisley and Kerslake's original performances replaced by new bass and drum tracks after both men had sued the singer for non-payment of royalties and related issues (despite playing on Diary of a Madman, Daisley and Kerslake's performances were credited to Rudy Sarzo and Tommy Aldridge for many years). In August, 2003, Daisley, Kerslake, Barnes and Morse recorded the album in Florida. Along with the Osbourne songs, the group also wrote five new tracks. Airey (who had also worked on the first two Osbourne albums and whose contributions were also uncredited) recorded his parts in London. Living Loud was released in 2004. While Morse and Airey were touring Australia with Deep Purple that year, Living Loud played two live shows, one at the Metro in Melbourne, and one at Fox Studios in Sydney. The latter event was recorded and released on DVD in 2005."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Lonestar is an American country music group consisting of Richie McDonald (lead vocals, acoustic guitar), Michael Britt (lead guitar, background vocals), Keech Rainwater (drums), and Dean Sams (keyboards, background vocals). Before the group's foundation in 1992, both Rainwater and Britt were members of the group Canyon. John Rich (bass guitar, lead and background vocals) was a member until he left in 1998, and later became one half of the duo Big & Rich, as well as a Nashville songwriter and record producer. Between 2007 and 2011, McDonald exited the band for a solo career, with former McAlyster lead singer Cody Collins replacing him as lead vocalist in this timespan. Lonestar has charted more than 20 singles on Hot Country Songs, including 9 that reached No. 1: \"No News\", \"Come Cryin' to Me\", \"Amazed\", \"Smile\", \"What About Now\", \"Tell Her\", \"I'm Already There\", \"My Front Porch Looking In\", and \"Mr. Mom\". \"Amazed\" also charted at No 1 on the Billboard Hot 100, becoming the first country song to do so since \"Islands in the Stream\" in 1983. \"Amazed\" and \"My Front Porch Looking In\" were the top country songs of 1999 and 2003, respectively, on Billboard Year-End. The group has recorded seven albums, one EP, and a greatest hits package for the defunct BNA Records, and one album each for three different independent labels. Three of their albums have been certified platinum or higher by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). The band's first two albums were defined by honky-tonk and neotraditionalist country influences, but subseuqent albums largely drew from country pop. Along with his work with the band, McDonald has co-written singles for Clay Walker, The Wilkinsons, Billy Dean, and Sara Evans, in addition to releasing two solo albums and singing guest vocals on Mindy McCready's 1996 single \"Maybe He'll Notice Her Now\"."@en ;

The band consists of four regular members: RAS-1 (lead vocals and guitar), Trey Pangborn (guitar), Eric Wilson (bass guitar) and Damion Ramirez (drums). Shortbus originated as a side project of RAS-1 and Eric Wilson, eventually taking shape after the Long Beach Dub Allstars disbanded in 2002. The band is something of a Supergroup: Eric Wilson from Sublime and Long Beach Dub Allstars, RAS-1 also from Long Beach Dub Allstars, Trey Pangborn from the Falling Idols and Bargain Music and Damion Ramirez from Capitol Eye. The latter two bands, albeit not as well known, were quintessential Long Beach bands that helped influence the sound of Long Beach Shortbus today. Their first CD was a self-titled EP and featured their hit \"California Grace.\" Their second CD was entitled Flying Ship of Fantasy, featuring tracks from their first album. \"California Grace\" is also available on the soundtrack to the MTV reality series Laguna Beach. On October 7, 2007, it was announced that the band would be parting ways. Their final show took place at the Haunted Ball And Chain festival in San Diego, CA, on November 2 and 3. Eric Wilson is now in Sublime with Rome, a new incarnation of Sublime which chiefly performs songs by that band and features Rome Ramirez filling in for their late singer/guitarist Bradley Nowell."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Madredeus (Portuguese pronunciation: [ma\u00F0\u027E\u0268\u02C8\u00F0ew\u0283]) is a Portuguese musical ensemble. Their music combines traditional Portuguese music (which is sometimes erroneously associated with the subgenre of Fado) with influences of modern folk music. The lyrics are often melancholy, related to the sea or travelling or absence, continuing a tradition of songs dating back to Medieval times (with obvious connection to cantigas de amigo among others). Madredeus founding members were Pedro Ayres Magalh\u00E3es (classical guitar), Rodrigo Le\u00E3o (keyboard synthesizer), Francisco Ribeiro (cello), Gabriel Gomes (accordion) and Teresa Salgueiro (vocals). Magalh\u00E3es and Le\u00E3o formed the band in 1985, Ribeiro and Gomes joined in 1986. In search of a female singer, they found Teresa Salgueiro in one of Lisbon's night clubs. Teresa agreed to join and, in 1987, Madredeus recorded their first album, Os dias da Madredeus. The first album was recorded in their rehearsal space, a converted abbey in Lisbon. The recording was especially strenuous due to deafening interruptions every 5 minutes from Lisbon's tram service, which ran directly above. In honour of this unavoidable presence in their every performance, they named themselves after the surrounding neighborhood, Madre de Deus (Mother of God), shortened to the vernacular Madredeus. In 1993, Pedro Ayres Magalh\u00E3es left the band temporarily and was replaced in live concerts by Jos\u00E9 Peixoto (classical guitar). Magalh\u00E3es rejoined the group later, making it a sextet with two guitarists. They released several albums and became very popular in Portugal, but remained relatively unknown abroad. This changed in 1994 when Wim Wenders, impressed by their music, asked Madredeus to perform in his movie Lisbon Story - the soundtrack gave the band international fame. Madredeus consequently toured Europe, South America, Africa and Asia. In 1994, Rodrigo Le\u00E3o left the band to start a solo career, being replaced by Carlos Maria Trindade (keyboard synthesizer). In 1997, Francisco Ribeiro and Gabriel Gomes left the band as Madredeus' style started abandoning its fado roots with the release of O Para\u00EDso. At this time Fernando J\u00FAdice (Acoustic bass guitar) was invited to join them. The group would, again, be a quintet.Madredeus has sold over 3 million albums worldwide. In 1998, Madredeus contributed \"Os Dias S\u00E3o A Noite (Suso Saiz Remix)\" to the AIDS benefit compilation album Onda Sonora: Red Hot + Lisbon produced by the Red Hot Organization. In November 2007, Teresa Salgueiro announced she had left Madredeus and she has released six solo albums until now. Former member and co-founder Francisco Ribeiro released his first solo album Desiderata: A Jun\u00E7\u00E3o do Bem in 2009. He died on 14 September 2010 from cancer. In April 2012 Madredeus announced its new album Essencia. This album is a travel through Madredeus music for 25 years since it was formed. Madredeus announced too its new formation, composed of Beatriz Nunes (singer), Pedro Ayres de Magalh\u00E3es (guitar), Carlos Maria Trinidade (synthesizer), Jorge Varrecoso (violin), Antonio Figueirido (violin) and Luis Clode (cello). With this new formation Pedro Ayres said in an interview: \"The melody is much more supported, without losing harmonic and rhythmic sense and keeps walking Madredeus\"."@en ;

After modest success in the United States in the mid-1990s with the singles \"Slowly, Slowly\" and \"Open the Door\" and a series of albums produced by Michael Stipe, Bob Mould, and Geza X, the band went on an extended hiatus due to the dissolution of their record label. They returned with a new rhythm section in 2005 on the Daemon Records release Mouthfeel. The band has continued to perform and record since this reunion and have self-released two more albums. Magnapop's musical style is noted for blending the pop vocals and melodies of Hopper with the aggressive, punk-influenced guitar-playing of Morris and her back-up vocal harmonies."@en ;

The group's current line-up consists of vocalist/guitarist Fher Olvera, drummer Alex \"El Animal\" Gonz\u00E1lez, guitarist Sergio Vall\u00EDn, and bassist Juan Calleros. Man\u00E1 has earned four Grammy Awards, eight Latin Grammy Awards, five MTV Video Music Awards Latin America, six Premios Juventud awards, nineteen Billboard Latin Music Awards and fifteen Premios Lo Nuestro awards. It is considered by many as the most influential and successful Latin American band of all time with over 40 million albums sold worldwide. Man\u00E1 has topped the all-time lists in much of Latin America and in their native Mexico, where they set landmarks in record sales and concert attendances. The band formed in 1986 and released its first album, Falta Amor, in 1990. In 1992, the group released \u00BFD\u00F3nde Jugar\u00E1n Los Ni\u00F1os?, which sold more than 10 million copies worldwide, (over 700,000 copies in the US alone) becoming the best selling Spanish-language rock album of all time. After several lineup changes, the group released Cuando los \u00C1ngeles Lloran (1995), which is noted for its stylistic departure from the band's previous work. Man\u00E1 followed with Sue\u00F1os L\u00EDquidos (1997), Revoluci\u00F3n de Amor (2002), and Amar es Combatir (2006), which continued the group's success. The band followed up with Drama y Luz in April 2011. Their most recent album is Cama Incendiada, which was released in early 2015. The band's sound draws from pop rock, Latin pop, calypso, reggae and ska music genres. They initially received international commercial success in Australia and Spain and have since gained popularity and exposure in the US, Western Europe, Asia, and the Middle East."@en ;

Its most popular line-up (which lasted from 1977-1999) was Martin Plaza (birth name Martin Murphy) on vocals and guitar; Reg Mombassa (birth name Chris O'Doherty) on lead guitar and vocals; his brother Peter \"Yoga Dog\" O'Doherty on bass guitar and vocals; Wayne de Lisle (birth name David Twohill) on drums; and Andrew \"Greedy\" Smith on vocals, keyboards and harmonica. Their original hit songs were generated by Mombassa, O'Doherty, Plaza and Smith, either individually or collectively; they also hit the Australian charts with covers of songs by Roy Orbison, Elvis Presley and Chuck Berry. Their top ten Australian singles are \"If You Leave Me, Can I Come Too?\" and \"Too Many Times\" (both from 1981), \"Live It Up\" (1985) and \"Rock and Roll Music\" (1988). Internationally, \"Too Many Times\" made the Canadian top 40 in 1982, and \"Live It Up\" peaked at No. 3 in UK, No. 4 in Norway, and No. 6 in Germany, after it featured in the 1986 Australian film \"Crocodile\" Dundee. All of the early members are visual artists and have had combined studio displays, some have had solo studio displays with Mombassa's artwork also used as designs by the Mambo clothing company. The majority of the group's record covers, posters and video clips have been designed and created by themselves or their art school contemporaries. On 27 August 2009, Mental As Anything was inducted into the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) Hall of Fame alongside Kev Carmody, The Dingoes, Little Pattie and John Paul Young."@en ;

The band's best-known lineup consisted of lead vocalist Gerard Way, guitarists Ray Toro and Frank Iero, bassist Mikey Way and drummer Bob Bryar. Founded by Gerard, Mikey, Toro, Matt Pelissier, and later joined by Iero, the band signed to Eyeball Records and released their debut album I Brought You My Bullets, You Brought Me Your Love in 2002. They signed with Reprise Records the next year and released their major label debut Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge in 2004. Shortly after the album's release, Pelissier was replaced by Bob Bryar. A commercial success, the album was awarded platinum status over a year later. The band eclipsed their previous success with their 2006 concept album, The Black Parade, which gained generally favorable reviews among music critics and was certified double platinum in the United Kingdom, the band's first and only double platinum. After the departure of long-time drummer Bob Bryar in March 2010, the band released their fourth studio album, Danger Days: The True Lives of the Fabulous Killjoys, in November that same year, to positive reviews. After the addition of touring keyboardist James Dewees in 2012 and the release of Conventional Weapons, a series of singles recorded in 2009, released over the course of five months, the band announced its break-up on March 22, 2013, one month after the final release in the Conventional Weapons series. After the band's split, a greatest hits album entitled May Death Never Stop You was released in March 2014. A tenth anniversary reissue of The Black Parade was released in September 2016 titled The Black Parade/Living with Ghosts."@en ;

The band's sound, rooted in rock and country, is often experimental and psychedelic. The group amassed a following beginning in the 2000s in part due to their live performances. The group first found success in Europe after the release of their debut album, The Tennessee Fire (1999). Their next release, At Dawn (2001), led to a large stateside following and preceded several lineup changes. After signing to major label ATO Records, the group released two albums, It Still Moves (2003) and Z (2005), with the latter representing a critical breakthrough. Their next release, Evil Urges (2008), was more polarizing for fans and critics, while Circuital (2011), their sixth album, saw a more measured response. After many years of side projects and touring, the band's seventh album, The Waterfall, was released in 2015."@en ;

The band are unusual for using two bass players in their lineup: Alex Griffin plays melody lines high up on one bass, and Mat Cheslin plays the regular bass lines on the other. This gives the band a tense and highly driven sub-hardcore sound featuring distorted effects-laden guitar and energetic drums. The band was formed while at sixth form college and they recorded their first album while some of the members were still teenagers. This led to a strong teenaged fanbase with a reputation for enjoying crowd surfing and moshing at their gigs. The band was also noted (and occasionally ridiculed) for their early image, which consisted of uniformly crimped hair and a predilection for sporting shorts and band or skateboard T-shirts. \"The Neds\" (as their fans referred to them) were well known for their own distinctive T-shirts, reportedly producing over 86 different designs within three years (1987\u20131990).

	dbo:abstract	"Nortec Collective is a musical ensemble formed by various individual one or two man production projects. The group came together in Tijuana, Baja California, Mexico. Their sound genre mixes electronica with musical elements and instrumentation of Tambora and Norte\u00F1o music, resulting in the nortec (\"norte\u00F1o\" + \"techno\") style. The various projects began producing and performing Nortec music around 1999. In 2001, they were signed to a recording contract with Palm Pictures, that released their first album \"Tijuana Session Volume 1\" under the name Nortec Collective. The line-up for that album included Bostich, Clorofila, Fussible, Hiperboreal, Panoptica, Plankton Man and Terrestre. The latter two would leave Nortec Collective in 2002. Nortec Collective's second album, Tijuana Sessions, Vol. 3, (Nacional Records) received much critical praise and was nominated for two Latin Grammy awards in 2006. In 2008, Nortec Collective ceased to function as a proper collective, with the various individual projects performing and recording separately. According to the Collective's Myspace page, \"For the time being, Nortec Collective has decided to release music separately \u2026\" and \"Until further notice, there will be not be any bookings for Nortec, Nortec Collective or Colectivo Nortec with the full four member line-up.\" The various individual projects went on to release and perform separately. 2008's Tijuana Sound Machine by Bostich and Fussible (also Nacional Records) was nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Latin Rock/Alternative Album. The Nortec Collective has borrowed several elements of Banda music sub-culture and have used them both in their songs (Narcoteque, Almada) and in their visuals and album covers."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Okkervil River is an American rock band led by singer-songwriter Will Sheff. Formed in Austin, Texas in 1998, the band takes its name from a short story by Russian author Tatyana Tolstaya set on the river in St Petersburg. They began as a trio made up of Sheff and friends he'd met in his native state of New Hampshire but, over time, have gone through many lineups. Okkervil River self-released their first album, Stars Too Small to Use, which led them to the South by Southwest music festival. After recording their first album in a garage, they signed with Jagjaguwar. They continued by releasing four more albums, including the critically lauded concept album Black Sheep Boy. After a period of touring for Black Sheep Boy, Okkervil River followed up with The Stage Names. The album sold 10,000 in its opening week in the United States. The group released a free covers album, Golden Opportunities Mixtape from their live performances. The band has garnered positive critical reception. They have appeared on the talk show Late Night with Conan O'Brien and have performed with acts such as The Decemberists, The New Pornographers, The National, and Lou Reed. Okkervil River released the album The Stand Ins on 9 September 2008. They promoted the release with a series of cover songs from the album on YouTube by people they've met as a band. Their 2010 collaboration as a backing band with psychedelic rocker Roky Erickson yielded True Love Cast Out All Evil. On 10 May 2011, Okkervil River released their sixth full-length album, I Am Very Far, which peaked at No. 32 on the Billboard 200. The band released their seventh album, The Silver Gymnasium, on 3 September 2013. The album peaked at No. 66 on the Billboard 200. The band\u2019s most recent album, Away, was released on September 9th, 2016 on ATO Records."@en ;

They were formally inducted into the Grand Ole Opry on September 17, 2013. Their ninth album, Remedy, released in 2014, won the Grammy Award for Best Folk Album. The group's music has been called old-time, folk, and alternative country. Along with original songs, the band performs many pre-World War II blues and folk songs. Bluegrass musician Doc Watson discovered the band while its members were busking outside a pharmacy in Boone, North Carolina in 2000. With an old-time string sound fueled by punk rock energy, it has influenced acts like Mumford & Sons and contributed to a revival of banjo-picking string bands playing Americana music\u2014leading to variations on it. The band released five studio albums\u2014O.C.M.S. (2004), Big Iron World (2006), Tennessee Pusher (2008), Carry Me Back (2012), and Remedy (2014). Their song \"Wagon Wheel\", written by frontman Ketch Secor through a co-authoring arrangement with Bob Dylan, was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America in April 2013 and has been covered by a number of acts, including Darius Rucker, who made the song a top 40 hit. The band was featured along with Edward Sharpe and the Magnetic Zeros and Mumford and Sons in the music documentary Big Easy Express, which won a Grammy Award for Best Long Form Music Video in 2013. They performed on the Railroad Revival Tour across the U.S. in 2011. They appeared at the Stagecoach Festival 2013 and multiple times at other major festivals, e.g., Bonnaroo Music Festival, MerleFest, Telluride Bluegrass Festival, Hardly Strictly Bluegrass Festival, and Newport Folk Festival. They make frequent guest appearances on A Prairie Home Companion with Garrison Keillor.

After recording their debut single \"Ode to a Forgetful Mind\" in 1988, P.M. Dawn released their first album Of the Heart, of the Soul and of the Cross: The Utopian Experience in 1991 to critical acclaim.

(Vibrations of Love and Anger and the Ponderance of Life and Existence) was also praised by critics and featured the hit singles \"I'd Die Without You\" and \"Looking Through Patient Eyes\". P.M.

The recording process of the album was marked by a legal dispute with record label EMI that eventually became the subject of the documentary film Artifact (2012). Thirty Seconds to Mars then moved to Universal Music and released the fourth album, Love, Lust, Faith and Dreams (2013), to critical and commercial success. As of September 2014, the band has sold over 15 million albums worldwide. Thirty Seconds to Mars has consistently enjoyed sold out tours and numerous headlining festival slots. The band is noted for its energetic live performances and for fusing many music genres. They have been compared to the sounds of bands such as Pink Floyd, The Cure, Tool, and U2, for their philosophical and spiritual lyrics, concept albums and their use of experimental music. Thirty Seconds to Mars has received several awards and accolades throughout their career, including a Guinness World Record, and has been included in the Kerrang! list of best artists of the 2000s."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Wolfmother is an Australian hard rock band from Sydney, New South Wales. Formed in 2000 by vocalist and guitarist Andrew Stockdale, bassist and keyboardist Chris Ross, and drummer Myles Heskett, the group currently includes Stockdale, bassist and keyboardist Ian Peres, and touring drummer Alex Carapetis. Wolfmother released their self-titled debut album Wolfmother in Australia in 2005, and internationally in 2006, which has since sold over 1.5 million copies worldwide and won the band a number of industry awards. Ross and Heskett left the band in 2008. Stockdale returned with a new lineup featuring Peres, rhythm guitarist Aidan Nemeth and drummer Dave Atkins in 2009, releasing Cosmic Egg later in the year. After more personnel changes, the group's planned third album was released in 2013 as Keep Moving, a Stockdale solo album. Later that year, Wolfmother returned as a trio featuring Peres and drummer Vin Steele for 2014's New Crown. The band's fourth album, Victorious, featured two guest drummers and was released in 2016. Wolfmother have been categorised by various commentators within the genres of hard rock, heavy metal, stoner rock and psychedelic rock. They are often compared to influential classic rock and metal bands from the 1960s and 1970s, including Led Zeppelin, Black Sabbath, Blue Cheer and AC/DC. Frontman Stockdale has typically led songwriting for the group, although the material on the band's debut album was co-credited to Ross and Heskett. Stockdale also produced New Crown and performed bass on Victorious."@en ;

Miller, Conley and Prescott share singing and songwriting duties. In early years the band's recordings were all released on the small Boston-based record label Ace of Hearts. Despite initial success, Mission of Burma disbanded in 1983 due to Miller's development of tinnitus caused by the volume of the band's live performances. In its original lineup, the band released only two singles, an EP, and one LP, Vs. Mission of Burma reformed in 2002, with Bob Weston replacing Swope, and has since recorded four more albums, ONoffON, The Obliterati, The Sound The Speed The Light and Unsound."@en ;
