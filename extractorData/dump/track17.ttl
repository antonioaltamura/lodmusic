Originally intended as the B-side to \"Schoolboy Crush\", it was released as Richard's debut single on 29 August 1958 and became his first hit record, reaching no.2 on the UK singles chart. It is credited with being one of the first authentic rock and roll songs produced outside the United States. \"Schoolboy Crush\", written by Aaron Schroeder and Sharon Gilbert, had already been recorded in the US by Bobby Helms. Cliff Richard and the Drifters recorded their own version, which was intended to be the A-side of their debut single. However \"Move It\" was heard by producer Jack Good, who insisted that if Richard was to appear on his TV show Oh Boy!, he would have to sing \"Move It\". The planned single was flipped, and climbed to number 2 in the charts, starting Cliff Richard on a career which included British hits through six decades. His first no.1 record was \"Living Doll\" in 1959. Described by Allmusic as \"Presley-esque\" and by Richard himself as \"my one outstanding rock 'n' roll classic\", \"Move It\" was written atop a London double-decker bus on the way to a rehearsal at Richard's house by the Drifters guitarist Ian \"Sammy\" Samwell. A second verse was written by Samwell for the Hank Marvin album Hank plays Cliff in 1995, with Cliff Richard once more providing the vocals. The new version was debuted live at a Royal Variety Performance in front of Queen Elizabeth II that year. Since then, Richard has continued to perform the song with the additional verse."@en ;

He even states this in the song: De toute fa\u00E7on tu t'enfous de c'que j'dirais. Que je fasse mon refrain ou pas, que je le bosse ou que j'le bacle alors j'dirais n'importe quoi, which in English means \"anyway you don't care about what I'd say.

dbr:Bang-A-Boomerang	rdf:type	dbo:MusicalWork ;
	dbo:abstract	"\"Bang-A-Boomerang\" is a song by ABBA, first released by Svenne & Lotta (both Swedish and English-language versions). The track was first recorded as a demo with English lyrics (but without any recorded vocals) in September 1974 by the ABBA musicians for their forthcoming eponymous album ABBA. The song was written by Benny Andersson, Bj\u00F6rn Ulvaeus and Stig Anderson and at one point had the working title \"Stop and Listen to Your Heart\". The lyrics compare the \"message of love\" with the returning boomerangs which the Australian Aborigines developed. In late 1974 Andersson, Ulvaeus and Anderson were invited by Sveriges Television as composers to submit a song to the 1975 melodifestivalen. Since ABBA themselves did not want to compete in the contest again, just one year after having won, they instead gave the opportunity and the song to Polar Music labelmates Svenne & Lotta. \"Bang-A-Boomerang\" was given new Swedish lyrics by Stig Anderson and retitled \"Bang en Boomerang\" and the duo subsequently made a vocal recording of the track in November 1974 - produced by Bj\u00F6rn & Benny - with a different arrangement, most noticeably slightly shorter (2:50) than the original demo, to fit the Eurovision three-minute rule. The song finished 3rd in the Swedish preselections in February 1975, became one of Svenne & Lotta's biggest hits and spent 7 weeks on the Svensktoppen radio chart during the period 9 March-11 May 1975, with a 2nd place as best result. Svenne & Lotta also recorded the song with the original English lyrics, both versions were included on their 1975 album Svenne & Lotta 2/Bang-A-Boomerang (Polar POLS 259). The English version was also released as a single in Denmark and became a big seller there, from a Scandinavian perspective the track is therefore still primarily seen as a hit single and Melodifestivalen classic by Svenne & Lotta. Under the name of \"Sven & Charlotte\", their original English version was also released in most European countries, and in Oceania, charting in several. ABBA then re-recorded their English-language version of the song in the Spring of 1975, using the Svenne & Lotta backing track - reputedly to the surprise of the duo, included it on their ABBA album and later also released it as a single in France on 21 April 1975, with \"SOS\" as B-side, where it was a minor hit. Although the track was included on the band's first Greatest Hits album, released on 17 November 1975, the ABBA version was in fact never issued as a single in Scandinavia."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"Keeps Gettin' Better\" is a song by American singer Christina Aguilera, taken from her first greatest hits album, Keeps Gettin' Better: A Decade of Hits (2008). It was released on September 9, 2008, by RCA Records as the only single from the album. The song was written and produced by Linda Perry, with additional songwriting from Aguilera. After giving birth to her son Max, she looked to \"come up with something new and fresh\", developing a \"futuristic\" era of her career. \"Keeps Gettin' Better\" is an electroclash and electropop song, and was inspired by the likes of Andy Warhol and Goldfrapp. Its lyrics portray Aguilera as a superhero. Upon its release, \"Keeps Gettin' Better\" received generally mixed reviews from music critics. At a time when dance music was becoming increasingly prominent, the song was criticized for its lack of originality, but was deemed \"catchy\" and a welcome change from Aguilera's fifth studio album Back to Basics (2006). It became Aguilera's highest debut on the US Billboard Hot 100 at number seven. The song additionally topped the US Hot Dance Club Play chart. Elsewhere, it peaked at number four in Canada, while charting inside the top twenty in Austria, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Slovakia and the United Kingdom. The accompanying music video, directed by Peter Berg, features Aguilera in an editing room, producing the music video on a green screen. Using the equipment there, she creates several characters, including a blonde 1960's inspired hippie character, another based on Catwoman and a futuristic blue-haired version of herself. Aguilera debuted the song during a live performance at the 2008 MTV Video Music Awards. Wearing a catsuit, she sang a remixed version of her debut single \"Genie in a Bottle\" (1999), before performing \"Keeps Gettin' Better\". Aguilera also performed the song during a promotional tour for the album, and as part of a medley of her greatest hits on the 36th Annual American Music Awards."@en .

It was the third single from the album Different Class, following \"Common People\" and the double A-side \"Mis-Shapes\"/\"Sorted for E's & Wizz\", both of which reached No. 2. The song tells the story of a narrator falling for a childhood friend called Deborah, who is more popular than he is and wondering what it would be like to meet again when they are older. The song is based on true events. Pulp frontman Jarvis Cocker said \"the only bit that isn't true is the woodchip wallpaper.\" Deborah was based on a real life childhood friend of Cocker's, Deborah Bone, who moved away from Sheffield to Letchworth when she was 10. As the lyrics suggest, she did marry and have children. It is believed that the fountain referred to as the meeting place was Goodwin Fountain, formerly located on Fargate, in Sheffield city centre. The song's riff is said to be influenced by Laura Branigan's 1980s hit \"Gloria\". Due to its millennial subject matter, Pulp removed the song's synchronisation licence, effectively banning the song from being used in TV and radio trailers throughout 1999 and 2000."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"Porpoise Song (Theme from Head)\" is a song written by Gerry Goffin and Carole King and performed by pop/rock quartet The Monkees on their album Head. The song was commissioned by Bob Rafelson, the director and producer of the film Head. The song was released as a single in 1968, and reached #62 on the Billboard Hot 100. The single version runs over a minute longer than the album version. The song\u2019s lyrics and melody echoes the psychedelic vibe of mid-1960s rock music. Micky Dolenz provides the vocals, which are distorted by echoing effect, and a mix of organ riffs, cello, string-bass, woodwinds and horns float in and out of the tune. The lyrics call into question the order of the world and one\u2019s place therein, and there are also veiled in-joke references to Dolenz\u2019s childhood work as the star of the television series Circus Boy. The song was produced by its co-writer Gerry Goffin on 26, 28 and 29 February 1968. The track includes chimes, tubular bells and aquatic sound effects. \"Without a doubt, this is the most elaborate production ever for a Monkees recording.\" According to Bob Rafelson: In the Monkees' 1968 feature film Head, the song appears at the beginning and the end of the production. At the start of the film, the group are being chased after, running onto a bridge. In an attempt to escape, Dolenz jumps from the bridge as the others look on in shock. As Dolenz sinks, he's saved from drowning by a couple of beautiful mermaids. At the end of the film, the other members follow Dolenz and jump from the bridge. As they appear to swim to shore, they end up in a large water tank. Solarization visual effects are used on screen to mirror the psychedelic nature of the song\u2019s lyrics. The song also appears on several \"greatest hits\" albums by The Monkees. It was featured in Vanilla Sky, a 2001 film with Tom Cruise, Pen\u00E9lope Cruz and Cameron Diaz, and Season 6 episode 12 (\"The Quality of Mercy\") of Mad Men."@en ;

The song was released as the \"first official single\" from Bittersweet World on March 11, 2008, following the commercial disappointment of its predecessor, \"Outta My Head (Ay Ya Ya)\". \"Little Miss Obsessive\" is a pop rock power ballad that chronicles the \"ostensibly aural dance\" of a couple \"who break up to make up \u2013 and like it\". Simpson looked to herself for inspiration when writing the song. Music critics were divided on \"Little Miss Obsessive\"; some critics felt the song was impressive, while others were critical of Simpson's vocals and the song's lyrics. The song only managed to chart on the national charts of Canada and the United States, where it peaked at 72 and 96, respectively."@en ;

The song features a sample from the Frank Sinatra recording \"The Christmas Waltz\". George Michael performed the song live on December 13 for the final of the 2009 series of The X Factor. The day after the performance, physical copies of the song were sold out in one day, forcing George Michael's record label to print new copies.

The band decided to include the two last songs remaining from the recording sessions of their 2008 album Appeal to Reason, which musically, reminds more of their earlier hardcore punk material and less their latest melodic hardcore direction.The song \"Grammatizator\" is based on The Great Automatic Grammatizator, a novel by British author Roald Dahl. The song \"Grammatizator\" was released as an exclusive iTunes digital single on October 20, 2009, through the band's main record label DGC/Interscope, releasing it after the original 7\" vinyl was released on Fat Wreck.

The edit version was only released as the lead track on the Verve EP. Part of their \"psychedelic era\", this is another song with blurry visions of relationships and strong connections to drug taking, which the band, especially lead singer Richard Ashcroft, were more than apt to do. In fact, Ashcroft collapsed on stage at the 1994 Lollapalooza tour from dehydration as a result of taking too much ecstasy. The cover was taken on Formby Beach, Merseyside, England.

In the wake of William's passing on New Year's Day, 1953, the song shot to #1, his final chart topping hit for MGM Records.

It premiered on February 12, 2014, as the third single from the album. It was written and produced by Carey with Rodney Jerkins. An R&B song, the lyrics revolve around the singer reminiscing about a past lover. Critical response to the song was positive: Carey's breathy vocal style and use of the whistle register at the climax earned praise from critics. It also garnered several comparisons to one of Carey's previous singles, \"We Belong Together\" (2005). In the United States, \"You're Mine (Eternal)\" reached number 88 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, but it experienced greater success on the Hot Dance Club Songs chart, becoming her seventeenth number-one song. Elsewhere, it reached the top 20 in Hungary and on the UK R&B Chart and the top 30 in Spain. Carey co-directed the music video with photographer Indrani, which depicted the singer as a mermaid swimming around the lakes at the El Yunque National Forest in Puerto Rico. Recording artist Trey Songz appears as a love interest in the video. He also features on the urban remix of the song, performing his verses in the remix video. Carey has performed the song at the BET Honors and during a performance at the Empire State Building."@en ;

dbr:A_Message_to_Your_Heart	rdf:type	dbo:MusicalWork ;
	dbo:abstract	"\"A Message to Your Heart\", written and composed by Paul Curtis, was the United Kingdom's entry at the Eurovision Song Contest 1991, performed by Samantha Janus. Paul Curtis also penned the previous year's entry, \"Give a Little Love Back to the World.\" Samantha Janus won the right to perform at Rome by winning the UK national final, A Song for Europe, where she was the third singer to perform. As in the previous three years, the winner was picked via a nationwide telephone vote. Samantha Janus won over second-place finisher Brendan Faye by only 13,000 votes, in the slimmest margin since the telephone vote was introduced. At Rome, the song was performed twentieth on the night in March 1991, after Spain's Sergio Dalma with \"Bailar pegados\", and before Cyprus's Elena Patroklou with \"SOS.\" At the end of judging that evening, \"A Message to Your Heart\" took the tenth-place slot with 47 points. It was the worst showing for the United Kingdom since 1987, and resulted in the 1992 Song for Europe being retooled as far as telephone voting was concerned. Like the previous year, composer Paul Curtis submitted a topical entry for consideration; this time, the subjects were the less fortunate, suffering from poverty and starvation. Janus sung of the contrasts between the people who \"are hungry just from being born\", and the people who have too much, with \"their only hunger being greed.\" The \"message to [the] heart\" refers to Janus imploring the better-off to, at the very least, say a prayer for the less fortunate, ending with the well-known John Bradford quotation, \"There but for the grace of God, go I.\" In a somewhat ironic twist, the melody of the song is up-tempo. On the night of the Contest, Janus was dressed in a pink mini-dress, flanked by three women (Zoe Picot, Lucy Moorby, and Nikki Belsher) in white mini-dresses. Janus was also joined by two other \"ghost\" backing singers, masked by a music stand at the back of the stage; Kit Rolfe who had competed for the UK before in 1984 with the song \"Love Games\" (which, it was claimed, had also used \"ghost\" singers offstage), and Hazell Dean, who had worked extensively with Stock, Aitken and Waterman in the eighties. After Eurovision, the song placed at No. 30 on the UK Singles Chart, and was in the chart for 3 weeks. Janus went on to become a successful actress, starring in the sitcom Game On and the soap EastEnders. Despite her achievements, her entry into the Eurovision is frequently remarked upon. She has said regarding the experience that her failure in the contest devastated her at the time and thought it would spell the end of her career. She has also called her appearance 'ridiculous', in that she was dressed in a pink mini-dress while singing about starving children and says the lyrics of the song are burned into her memory forever."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"Well, Well, Well\" is a song by Welsh recording artist Duffy, from her second studio album, Endlessly (2010). It was released as the lead and only single from the album worldwide, beginning on 19 October 2010 in the UK. As with the rest of the album, the song was both written and produced by Duffy and Albert Hammond, with Stuart Price providing co-production. It is an up-tempo pop song in which Duffy questions her lover's accusations, with Duffy calling it a song about \"desire for freedom\" within a relationship. Marking a departure from the soul sound of her debut album, Rockferry (2008), the song received mixed reviews from critics; being both praised and criticized for Duffy's vocal style. Some thought that it \"is possibly the weakest of the new tunes\" from its parent album. Failing to meet the popularity of her previous singles, \"Well, Well, Well\" peaked at number 41 on the UK Singles Chart and number 37 on the European Hot 100 Singles chart. Commercially, it is her worst performing single to date, although it proved to be a moderate success in mainland Europe, reaching the top twenty in Finland, Belgium and Switzerland. The song's accompanying music video portrayed Duffy backed with male dancers in several scenes around the city of Oxford, England. The single was promoted extensively as part of a campaign of \"major TV moments\", taking in the UK, the United States as well as seven countries around Europe in 2010 and 2011. At 2:45, it is the shortest of all Duffy's singles."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"High by the Beach\" is a song recorded by American singer Lana Del Rey and the first single from her fourth studio album, Honeymoon (2015). Written by Lana Del Rey, Rick Nowels and Kieron Menzies. A synth-led trap-pop and hip hop ballad, it is more uptempo and pop-indebted than Del Rey's previous releases, but prominently recalls the hip hop and trip hop influences of her 2012 album, Born to Die. The song is based around electronic production, a trap beat and an orchestral organ arrangement. Preceded by a premature online leak, \"High by the Beach\" was released as the lead single from Honeymoon on August 10, 2015. The song received universal acclaim from music critics, many of which named it as one of Del Rey's best and catchiest releases. \"High by the Beach\" debuted at number 51 on the Billboard Hot 100 a week after its release, spending three weeks on the chart altogether. The song also ranked at #89 in Triple J's Hottest 100 songs of 2015 in Australia."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"Same Old Love\" is a song recorded by American singer Selena Gomez for her second studio album, Revival (2015). The track was written by Charli XCX, Ross Golan, and its producers Stargate and Benny Blanco. It was first composed by XCX and Stargate, later recorded by Gomez without the former in the studio at the time. \"Same Old Love\" is a midtempo electropop and synthpop song backed by a wonky piano loop, a finger-click beat and Italo disco synths. Gomez uses an uncharacteristic forceful, emotive tone and raspy delivery, accompanied by XCX on background vocals. Lyrically, \"Same Old Love\" is a torch song. According to Gomez, the lyrics are a representation of various stages of different relationships and are about getting rid of everything toxic in her life, also inspired by her relationship with her father. \"Same Old Love\" was released as the second single from Revival on September 10, 2015. A number of remixes were commissioned for its release, including an official remix featuring rapper Fetty Wap. The single received generally positive reviews from music critics who complimented its catchy tune and understated, moody sound. The song peaked at number five on the US Billboard Hot 100, marking Gomez's fourth top 10 single. \"Same Old Love\" also reached number one on the US Mainstream Top 40 chart and the top 10 in Canada, the Czech Republic and Slovakia. It was accompanied by a music video directed by Michael Haussman and filmed in the Broadway Theater District of Los Angeles. It premiered as an Apple Music exclusive on September 22, 2015 and was well received by critics who complimented Gomez's styling and the emotional storyline. The video was inspired by Gomez's relationships with her loved ones and fans, and singer Tony Bennett. It featured Gomez witnessing several dramatic vignettes on the streets of Los Angeles, and performing at a theater. Gomez promoted \"Same Old Love\" with several televised performances, including on The Ellen DeGeneres Show, The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon, and at the 2015 American Music Awards."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"On the Backs of Angels\" is a song by American progressive metal/rock band Dream Theater, featured on their 11th studio album A Dramatic Turn of Events. The song was written by the band's guitarist and producer John Petrucci, bassist John Myung, and keyboardist Jordan Rudess. \"On the Backs of Angels\" was released as A Dramatic Turn of Events' lead single via YouTube on June 29, 2011. A music video for the song was released on September 14, 2011. The song was nominated for Best Hard Rock/Metal Performance at the 2012 Grammy Awards, eventually losing to \"White Limo\" by Foo Fighters. In composing \"On the Backs of Angels\", on the advice from one of their fans and co-writers, Dream Theater tried to illustrate their signature sound. From the start, the band envisioned the song as an album opener that, according to Petrucci, would make their fans \"feel at home\". Clocking in at 8:43 long and with numerous time signature changes, the song is mostly played in 4/4 and 3/4 time. Its introduction features a moody and foreboding arpeggiated guitar pattern that was written by Petrucci and inspired by the music of said fan favorite, Pink Floyd. At 5:51, the song breaks down into a piano passage that was improvised by Rudess. Audiences were positively receptive of this song's music video, with some interviewed individuals referring to it as a true masterpiece, rivaling even Plato's Allegory of the Cave. It has been said that this song is the anthem of small groups of college students in the Northeastern region of the United States."@en ;

It was initially intended to be the first single from Minaj's debut studio album Pink Friday, but the release was later scrapped in favor of \"Your Love\". The song was a distinct change in Minaj's previous work on mixtapes and features, thus receiving mixed to positive reviews from critics, commending lyrical content and distinctiveness, and critiquing that it did not fit her \"Barbie\" persona well. An accompanying music video which features a helicopter chase, and militaristic jungle and desert scenes, was positively received. Commercially, the song had limited success, reaching number 65 on the US Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart but only managing to bubble under the Billboard Hot 100 at 22. Later in an interview with Billboard magazine, Garrett revealed that the song would not be included on Pink Friday and that the poor performance of the song was out of his control, \"I was only able to do as much as I was allowed to do.

	dbo:abstract	"\"Multi Viral\" is a single by Puerto Rican alternative hip hop band Calle 13, released on November 11, 2013, as the first and eponymous single from their 2014 fifth studio album, Multi Viral. It features additional vocals from Palestinian singer Kamilya Jubran; spoken words by Australian journalist Julian Assange (founder of WikiLeaks), which were recorded at the Embassy of Ecuador in London, where he currently resides under diplomatic asylum granted by the Ecuadorian government; and American guitarist Tom Morello, of Rage Against the Machine fame. The song covers the topic of media manipulation and disinformation while referencing to protests such as Occupy Wall Street and Yo Soy 132. Regarding the song, the band's singer and lyricist Residente said: \"Media is controlling everything, even people's minds, everything. Here in the U.S. it's worse, it's like a bubble ... It's important to have the right information, and you are not going to get that from one newspaper or one TV show. You have to look for that. In order to get the full picture, you have to read a lot and look for yourself. Otherwise you'll find yourself in a war that you think is a good idea, but it's not for a good reason.\" Morello declared he was convinced to work on the song when he knew Julian Assange would take part of it. He described Calle 13 as \"comrades in arms at the barricades. One of the hallmarks of their career is weaving their convictions into their kick-ass music, and that's something I've endeavored to do in my career as well."@en ;

dbr:Til_It_Happens_to_You	rdf:type	dbo:MusicalWork ;
	dbo:abstract	"\"Til It Happens to You\" is a song produced and performed by American singer Lady Gaga. She co-wrote the song with Diane Warren for the 2015 documentary film The Hunting Ground, which deals with campus rape in the United States. The song had leaked onto the Internet through an unofficial recording made at the film's premiere at the 2015 Sundance Film Festival. It was later released by Interscope Records to digital retailers on September 18, 2015. The director and producer of the film had looked for someone influential to write a song for it, and music supervisor Bonnie Greenberg contacted Warren who was interested. She wrote the song with Gaga and producer Nile Rodgers accompanied them during the recording, providing his suggestions. A universal song about any kind of loss in life, \"Til It Happens to You\" was placed during two sequences in the film, highlighting the pain of sexual assault. The song consists of an orchestral production with strings, and an emotional vocal delivery from Gaga. Lyrically it asks listeners to stand in a victim's position and try to understand the turmoil they go through. \"Til It Happens to You\" was later included as part of a public service announcement video directed by Catherine Hardwicke. The video depicts various instances of violence against women and sexual assaults. It ends with a cautionary note about the effects of such distress, and individuals finding solace with their close friends and relatives. Both the song and the video received positive critical response. Reviewers complimented Gaga's vocal delivery, the sympathetic tone of the lyrics as they related to the subject, as well as the realistic depictions of the sexual assaults in the clip, and Hardwicke's direction. A portion of the proceeds from retail sales was donated to organizations supporting victims of sexual assault. Commercially, the song reached the top-thirty in Finland, Greece, and Spain as well as the Bubbling Under Hot 100 Singles and Pop Digital songs in the United States. \"Til It Happens to You\" was nominated for a Best Song Written for Visual Media at the 58th Annual Grammy Awards, and for Best Original Song at the 88th Academy Awards, along with numerous awards."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"Come Dancing\" is a 1982 song written by Ray Davies and performed by British rock group the Kinks on their 1983 album State of Confusion. The song was inspired by Ray's memories of his older sister, Rene, who died of a heart attack while dancing at a dance hall. The track, sung from the perspective of an \"East End barrow boy,\" contains lyrics about dates at a local Palais dance hall. When first released as a single in United Kingdom in November 1982, \"Come Dancing\" failed to chart. Although Arista Records founder Clive Davis had reservations about releasing the single in the United States due to the English subject matter of dance halls, the track saw an American single release in April 1983. \"Come Dancing\" reached number six on the Hot 100, becoming the band's highest US charting single in over a decade and tying with \"Tired of Waiting for You\" as the band's highest charting single ever. This success was achieved largely with the help of a promotional music video directed by Julien Temple that saw frequent airing on MTV. As a result of its American success, the single was re-released in Britain. Unlike its first release, the single became a top 20 British hit, reaching number 12. In addition to its presence on State of Confusion, \"Come Dancing\" has appeared on numerous compilations albums since its release. It spawned a successful follow-up single, \"Don't Forget to Dance,\" which became a top 40 hit in the United States. Come Dancing, a musical written by Ray Davies that premiered in 2008, was named after the song."@en ;

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/I_Don\u0027t_Blame_You_at_All>	rdf:type	dbo:MusicalWork ;
	dbo:abstract	"\"I Don't Blame You At All\" was a 1971 R&B hit by The Miracles (AKA Smokey Robinson & The Miracles) on Motown Records' Tamla label. It was composed by Miracles lead singer, William \"Smokey\" Robinson,and produced by Robinson and Terry \"Buzzy\" Johnson, and was taken from their album, One Dozen Roses. This song was actually the follow-up hit to their #1 smash, \"The Tears of a Clown\", and reached the Top 20 of the Billboard Hot 100, charting at #18, and the Top 10 of the Billboard R&B chart, peaking at #7. It was also a Top 20 hit in the UK, reaching #11 on the British charts that year. It is also noted as the group's last Top 20 pop hit before Smokey Robinson's departure from The Miracles the following year, and was performed by the group on Dick Clark's American Bandstand on an episode dated July 10, 1971. In this sad, mournful tune, belying its up-tempo nature, Smokey, as the song's narrator, tells a girl that he obviously wants (that doesn't share his feelings) that he doesn't blame her for \"playing it cool\" when she decides to call off the relationship. Lamenting the fact that his attraction to her covered the fact that she had just casual feelings for him, he sings: \"I dont blame you at all,'cause you played it coolYou don't owe me a thing 'cause I was a foolI'm only paying the priceFor a trip I took to Paradise'Cause I looked into a pair of eyes, and what I thought was The Look Of LoveWas only hurt in disguise\" \"I Don't Blame You At All\" was the group's final big hit with Robinson, though the Miracles did continue to chart several times before his departure, with songs including \"Satisfaction\", \"I Can't Stand To See You Cry\", and \"We've Come Too Far to End It Now\". This song has inspired a cover version by Rosetta Hightower, and appears on many Miracles' \"Greatest Hits\" album and CD compilations."@en ;

The song was released as the fourth single from the album on 18 January 2010. The song was recorded at Ocean Way Recording, Hollywood, CA and mastered at Masterdisk. The lyrics of the song concern Neil's wife and family. Jacknife Lee, who previously remixed \"Silhouettes\" for the Biffy Clyro and Sucioperro side project Marmaduke Duke, recorded a remix for the song. Matt Cardle, winner of the 2010 series of The X Factor, recorded a studio version of the song under the title \"When We Collide\" and released it as his debut single, after having performed it in the final of the competition. Biffy Clyro fans launched an internet campaign to get the original track \"Many of Horror\" to the festive charts, with fans joining a Facebook campaign urging people to buy Biffy Clyro's original single rather than Cardle's cover version. This resulted in the Biffy Clyro version reaching number 8 in the UK Singles Chart, its highest position ever, and Cardle's version became the UK Christmas number 1. The song is featured on the deluxe edition soundtrack to the film Transformers: Dark of the Moon and is played during the end credits.

The song was produced by West and is constructed primarily around a vocal sample of \"Paper Planes\" by British musician M.I.A. \"Swagga like Us\" received mostly mixed reviews from music critics: whilst many complimented T.I.'s performance and the production, most denounced the other three rappers' performances as lyrically uninspired and overly brash, with Wayne and West also singled out for criticism from the perceived overuse of Auto-Tune in their vocals. Commercially, however, the song was a success despite a premature leak to the internet: it debuted and peaked at number five on the US Billboard Hot 100, and also charted modestly in a few overseas territories. It was nominated for Best Rap Song and Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group at the 51st Grammy Awards, winning the latter: the four rappers, alongside M.I.A. herself, also performed \"Swagger Like Us\" and the original \"Paper Planes\" during the ceremony."@en ;

Prominently built on the bassline of Pachelbel's Canon, the song was produced by Kane Beatz, and the melody of the song was based on the 2004 song \"Float On\" by Modest Mouse. Unlike Canon, which is traditionally in the key of D, the song transposes it to the G key. The song features backing vocals from JR Get Money. It was released to iTunes on November 9, 2010 and debuted at No. 57 on the Billboard Hot 100, eventually reaching a peak of No. 9. It was released in the UK on February 20, 2011. The song was a major point of contention for the artist and a reason for the lengthy delay of the album, making the title somewhat ironically fitting; as Lupe was told unequivocally by record producers: \"If you don't do 'The Show Goes On', your album's not coming out.\" However, XXL named it 14th Best Song of 2011.

Two XXXO remix EPs were released alongside the single, featuring Jay-Z and SBTRKT amongst others on official remixes. The song's release followed the digital release of \"Born Free\", also from Maya. An uptempo synthpop song, \"XXXO\" exhibits a Tamil folk music-influenced melody with elements of techno and tribal music displayed. The song's instrumentation consists of marching band percussion, and backing vocals, drawing inspiration from pop music. \"XXXO\" is lyrically based on the theme of the creation of a sex symbol and romance in the digital age. Music critics praised the direction of the record, its playful lyrics and futuristic sound. An accompanying music video for the song was filmed by M.I.A. during the month of July 2010, who opted to direct herself having initially commissioned Hype Williams to direct. It features graphics interchange formats and animation of her album artwork, and depicts the singer singing seductively to the camera and scenes from her flip-cam, framed by stars, greeting card flower decorations and English words written in Arabic alphabet or A, B, Cs. The video features leopard imagery alongside references to social networking platforms such as MySpace and YouTube, with the singer singing \"you want me be somebody who I'm really not\" as the song's chorus. The video was nominated for the \"Best Video\" award at the 2011 UK Asian Music Awards. The \"XXXO Burka\" she wore to the 2010 Scream Awards was named by TIME as the second top fashion statement of 2010. Following the release of Maya, the song charted at number 26 in the United Kingdom and number 30 in Scotland, debuting at number two on the UK Indie Chart and number 12 on the UK R&B Chart. \"XXXO\" is M.I.A.'s second single to reach the UK top 40 and second most successful single in the UK after \"Paper Planes\" reached number 19 in 2009. The single debuted at number 74 in Australia, charted at number 39 in Spain, reached number 60 on the Billboard Japan Hot 100, and the top ten on the Danish radio airplay chart and in Belgium. \"XXXO\" was danced to by contestants Robert Roldan and Courtney Galliano of So You Think You Can Dance in 2010 for their Jazz selection. M.I.A. performed the song live for the first time at the Toronto Sound Academy in 2010. Critically, \"XXXO\" was lauded as yet another departure for M.I.A.. The song was listed at number two on the NME's best tracks of 2010 and in October 2011, the publication placed it at number 70 on its list \"150 Best Tracks of the Past 15 Years\"."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"What it Was, Was Football\" is a monologue by comedian Andy Griffith. At the request of Andy Griffith, a 19-year-old, Milton Alderfer, recorded and produced the original master tape in Greensboro, North Carolina. From that tape, Andy then had the master tape mass-produced in Chapel Hill, North Carolina by Colonial Records label in 1953. Soon, Colonial had sold nearly 50,000 copies of the record and then sold the masters to Capitol Records. Capitol released the record in the same year, which soon had sold nearly 800,000 copies, and was instrumental in launching Griffith's career in television, stage, and film. The record is still one of the biggest-selling comedy records of all time. On the original single, the monologue is credited to \"Deacon Andy Griffith.\" The monologue is a description of a college football game, as seen by a naive country preacher who attends the game by accident and is entirely puzzled by it. Griffith made an appearance on The Ed Sullivan Show in 1954, in large part due to the popularity of the record. \"What it Was, Was Football\" was printed in Mad magazine in 1958, with illustrations by artist George Woodbridge. Most of the text of the recording is printed verbatim with faithful renderings of Griffith's accent as heard on the recording; however, Griffith's original climactic description of \"the awfullest fight that I have ever seen...in my life!\" is moved to an earlier position in the printed version. Also, while the original recording makes no direct reference to a specific university as a setting for the game witnessed, the illustrations in the Mad version refer to both the Ivy League and University of Notre Dame. Due to licensing issues, this adaptation had to be omitted from the Totally MAD CD-ROM collection of the magazine's run. In 1987, Andy Griffith made an appearance on The Tonight Show promoting his series, Matlock. During the interview, guest host Bill Cosby told Griffith that he had purchased Griffith's recording of \"What it Was, Was Football\". Cosby then told Griffith that he had performed it at school and received an A for his grade much to Griffith's surprise and delight. In 1997, the monologue was made into a short film."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"Give Me All Your Luvin'\" is a song by American singer Madonna from her twelfth studio album, MDNA (2012). It features guest vocals by rappers Nicki Minaj and M.I.A. The song was written and produced by Madonna and Martin Solveig, with additional writing by M.I.A., Minaj and Michael Tordjman. After working with Solveig on one song, Madonna continued recording others including \"Give Me All Your Luvin'\". Madonna chose to work with M.I.A. and Minaj on the track, since she felt they were both strong women with a unique voices, she liked their music and what they represented. A demo version of the song was leaked on November 8, 2011, under the name \"Give Me All Your Love\", resulting in a man from Spain being arrested for copyright violations. The final version of the song was released on February 3, 2012, by Interscope Records as the lead single from MDNA. The track was her debut single from her 360 deal with Live Nation Entertainment which was signed in 2007. Backed by bouncing synthesizers, marching drums and a cheer, \"Give Me All Your Luvin'\" is a dance-pop song, with elements of new wave and disco. Madonna executes the chorus in high-pitched vocals while during its dubstep breakdown, Minaj raps her verse as her alter-ego Roman Zolanski, followed by M.I.A. rapping her verse. \"Give Me All Your Luvin'\" received mixed reviews from music critics. Its chorus was noted as a highlight by critics, who described it as catchy; however, they felt that the musical composition was inferior to Madonna's previous singles. Media also reported on similarities of the track with singer Nicola Roberts' \"Beat of My Drum\", especially the cheerleader like verses. Madonna partnered with Clear Channel media to launch radio support for the track, and from February 3 it was played across 95 Mainstream and Rhythmic radio stations owned by them. Commercially, the song attained success peaking at number one in Canada, Finland and Hungary, and inside the top ten in several European countries. It became Madonna's 38th top-ten song on the United States Billboard Hot 100 chart, extending her record as the artist with most top-ten singles in the chart's history. It also gave Madonna her 41st chart topper on the Hot Dance Club Songs chart, extending her record as the artist with the most number one singles in that chart. The song's accompanying music video featuring both Minaj and M.I.A. was filmed in December 2011, and was directed by Megaforce. It shows Madonna, Minaj and M.I.A. along with cheerleaders wearing animegao masks and football players. Madonna first performed the song at the Super Bowl XLVI halftime show along with Minaj and M.I.A. During the performance the latter extended her middle finger towards the camera while rapping her verse. M.I.A. was criticized in the media and broadcaster NBC and the National Football League (NFL) issued apologies. They also fined the rapper which was resolved through a confidential agreement. Later that year, Madonna also performed \"Give Me All Your Luvin'\" wearing a majorette outfit on The MDNA Tour."@en ;

dbr:Love_Is_Noise	rdf:type	dbo:MusicalWork ;
	dbo:abstract	"\"Love Is Noise\" is a song by English alternative rock band The Verve and is the second track on their fourth album, Forth. It was released as the first single from the album on 3 August 2008 as a digital download, with the physical release on 11 August 2008 in the United Kingdom (see 2008 in British music). The song received its first airplay by Zane Lowe on BBC Radio 1 on 23 June 2008. The promo video for the song debuted on the band's MySpace on 9 July. Richard Ashcroft stated that lyrically the song is a take off of William Blake's \"And did those feet in ancient time\", commonly known as 'Jerusalem'. Whereas in Blake's song the title verse is \"and did those feet in ancient time. Walk upon England's mountains green?\" Love is Noise asks: \"Will those feet in modern times / Walk on soles that are made in China?\", and allusion to \"Bright prosaic malls\" instead of \"dark Satanic mills\". This is the second time Richard Ashcroft has referenced Blake, following 1995's \"History\".[citation needed] \"Love Is Noise\" derived from another song off the album, \"Columbo\". While recording that track Richard created a new loop on a vocoder and added it to the song. \"Columbo\" was practically a jam the band had been working on for a couple of days. After that loop was added, all the band started adding some stuff on to it until finally, it evolved into a different track. The song has been played live as early as the late 2007 gigs, but was given different names such as \"Modern Times\", \"Love is Pain\", \"Love is noise (with boy)\". The band played it with a huge warm reception at 2008's Coachella as the setlist's closer, something that was repeated in Glastonbury's Pyramid Stage on 29 June. The video for the song was released on the band's MySpace. The video mixes up shots of the band performing in a dimly-lit room, with frontman Richard Ashcroft sitting on the floor, with montages of other images, including snow-capped mountains, a North Korean choreography, a couple about to kiss, a dancer and a blonde woman with an eagle. The single debuted in the UK Singles Chart at #5 after its first week of release via online download alone. The following week the song peaked at #4 and stayed 5 weeks in the UK Top 10. It marked a great return for The Verve, charting as their third UK Top 5 single and their fourth to crack the UK Top 10. It had great success around Europe, charting on the Top 20 for 6 weeks so far. It also reached the Top 10 in Ireland, Malta, Sweden, and Italy."@en ;

It is based on a sample from the song \"Boops (Here to Go)\" by Sly and Robbie. The single was released on 4 September 2006, although download purchases allowed it to reach number 30 on the UK Singles Chart on 3 September. After the release of the CD single, it ascended 26 places to number 4, selling 24,821 copies, beaten by Nelly Furtado featuring Timbaland's \"Promiscuous\", Justin Timberlake's \"SexyBack\" and Scissor Sisters' \"I Don't Feel Like Dancin'\". Although the single charted relatively high, Williams was mocked by sections of the tabloid press, who said the single was a failure due to his radical change in direction on the song, with The Sun dubbing it the \"worst song ever\". Williams responded to the criticism by joking about it, telling an audience at his concert in Leeds on 8 September that the song was \"number one... in Germany\" and saying it was \"made to feel as welcome as a ginger step child\". The track was also nominated for the 2006 Ivor Novello Award. In the song Williams makes several cultural references including Adidas, T.K. Maxx (in a joke about product placement, \"T.K. Maxx costs less!\"), Michael Jackson, Durex condoms, The Matrix and Mandrex.

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/We\u0027ve_Come_Too_Far_to_End_It_Now>	rdf:type	dbo:MusicalWork ;
	dbo:abstract	"We've Come Too Far to End It Now was a 1972 single by Motown Records R&B group The Miracles (AKA \"Smokey Robinson & The Miracles\") on its Tamla Label subsidiary,(T54220F) and taken from their album, \"Flying High Together\", the group's final studio album with original lead singer Smokey Robinson.This song charted at #46 on the Billboard Pop Chart, and reached the Top 10 of its R&B chart, peaking at # 9. Written by Motown staff songwriter Johnny Bristol, along with writers David H. Jones, and Wade Brown, and arranged by legendary writer/producer H. B. Barnum, this song was conceived as the Miracles' \"swan song\" with Robinson, who left the group shortly thereafter (even though the group actually had one more single release with Robinson from that same LP, I Can't Stand To See You Cry, this song was the group's way of saying goodbye to the Smokey Robinson era and Smokey's way of saying goodbye to the group's fans and to his friends and singing partners in The Miracles, Bobby Rogers, Pete Moore, and Ronnie White).Motown singer/songwriter Johnny Bristol also co-wrote The Supremes'final hit with Diana Ross, \"Someday We'll Be Together\"). After singing in the group from 1955 until 1972, Smokey decided to retire from the group to spend more time with his family, and to concentrate on his duties as Vice President of the Motown Record Corporation.Smokey's wife, Miracles member Claudette Robinson, left the group when her husband did. Despite having retired from live performances 8 years prior,(in 1964), Claudette continued recording with the group in the studio, finally retiring in 1972 to raise the couple's two children, Berry and Tamla, and concentrate on being a stay at home wife and mom. Miracle Marv Tarplin stayed with the group an additional year, then decided to leave the Miracles to work with Smokey, writing songs and eventually touring with him, once Robinson decided to do limited touring as a solo artist. Like the Miracles' 1965 hit, Ooo Baby Baby, We've Come Too Far told the story of a troubled long-time relationship between a couple nearing a breakup, with Smokey, as the song's narrator, apologizing to his wife for his wrongs, with the hopes of saving the relationship: In the 2006 Motown DVD, Smokey Robinson & The Miracles: The Definitive Performances), Miracles bass singer and vocal arranger Pete Moore replied, when asked about Smokey's decision to depart the group, said it made him \"very sad, because we had been together for so long, since we were kids ,and had done so many wonderful things in the music industry up to that point... and obviously, we didn't want to see Smokey leave...because we loved him and he loved us...so it took us a while...for that idea to sink in...but once it did...we had to seek a replacement...\" The song's title,\"We've Come Too Far Too End It Now\" actually has a double meaning, in that, in addition to being the song's theme, it actually also referred to The Miracles themselves. Yet, in 1972,after over 15 years together,that is exactly what they did.(The Miracles would, of course, continue, but with new lead singer Billy Griffin). This song has spawned a cover version by The Escorts and has appeared in several Miracles \"greatest hits\" CD compilations.It was also performed by The Miracles live on their final live album with Smokey, Smokey Robinson & The Miracles: 1957-1972 .The song's \"B\" side, When Sundown Comes, was actually earmarked as an \"A\" side release,(Tamla 54211), but was cancelled in favor of the song \"Satisfaction\""@en ;

It was released on August 25, 2009 as the lead single from the album. The song was co-written by Emily Osment and Anthony Fagenson, and was produced by James Maxwell Collins. Lyrically, Osment stated she wanted the song to be about \"breaking out\" and that \"a lot of kids can relate to that\". Musically, \"All the Way Up\" is an uptempo pop-rock song, which influences from other genres as well, mainly rock and indie rock. The song received generally positive reviews from music critics. Some have praised Osment's \"spunk\", and also make comment about how she chose not to join with Hollywood Records, like most other Disney Channel artist. However, some call the song childish, stating that Osment tries to come across as \"fierce\", but just falls flat in the end. However, some have praised the single, calling it a magnificent start to her career. Osment herself has stated that the song is influenced by Alanis Morissette's album, Jagged Little Pill.[citation needed] \"All the Way Up\" failed to garner much attention on the music charts, but it did manage to enter the charts in a few international territories, as well as becoming a hit on Radio Disney. The music video was directed by Roman White and features Osment, along with the band Push Play rehearsing a performance of the song in their apartment. The video shows the effects the loud music has on all of the surrounding apartments. \"All the Way Up\" was performed on Osment's first tour, the \"Clap Your Hands Tour\", as well as the American talk show, The View."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"When You're Young and in Love\" is a song composed by Van McCoy. The first recording of the song was by Ruby & the Romantics; like all the group's singles on Kapp Records the track was produced by label a&r head Allen Stanton. Released in September 1964, Ruby & the Romantics' \"When You're Young...\" reached the Top Five in Honolulu but otherwise failed to register strongly in any US market reaching #48 on the Billboard Hot 100 in November 1964. Ruby & the Romantics would score one subsequent Hot 100 placing, with \"Does He Really Care For Me\" (#87).However, the song was a bigger hit in Canada, peaking at #25 on the RPM \"Top Tracks\"that year.The song was covered in 1967 by the Marvelettes with the track - produced by James Dean and William Weatherspoon - reaching #23 on the Hot 100 that June; its R&B peak was #9. Although not one of the Marvelettes' very biggest US hits, \"When You're Young...\" became the only record by the group to achieve hit status in the UK with a #13 peak in July 1967. The track is also one of the last Marvelettes' singles to feature Gladys Horton although the lead is by Wanda Young; Horton would only appear, and lead, on the following two B-Sides. Besides Horton and veteran Marvelette Katherine Anderson, Rogers' vocal backing on \"When You're Young...\" features Motown's premier session singers the Andantes while the original instrumental backing on the track by the Funk Brothers was augmented by the Detroit Symphony Orchestra. In the autumn of 1975 competing versions of \"When You're Young...\" by Ralph Carter and the Choice Four charted R&B with the Carter version reaching #37 on the R&B charts where the Choice Four peaked at #45; both versions were also minor Hot 100 crossovers with respective peaks of #95 (Carter) and #91 (Choice Four). Ralph Carter would promote his version with a performance on the April 3, 1976 episode of his Good Times sitcom; his recording was produced by Norman Bergen and Reid Whitelaw. The Choice Four version was produced by the song's composer Van McCoy. A 1979 remake of \"When You're Young...\" is notable as the debut single for Stacy Lattisaw and also for being produced by composer Van McCoy; however the McCoy produced album Young and in Love proved neither a critical or commercial success upon release in July 1979 - the month of McCoy's death - with the \"When You're Young...\" single barely registering on the R&B charts at #91. Gitte made a recording of \"When You're Young and in Love\" on 23 October 1964. The song has also been recorded by Donny and Marie - as \"(When You're) Young and in Love\" - and the Jets."@en ;

It appeared on his 1975 album Struttin' My Stuff and was released as a single the following year. Bishop does not sing lead vocals on the track; feeling that his gravelly voice wouldn't do the song justice, he invited vocalist Mickey Thomas, who was a background singer in his band at the time, to sing it. The song peaked at #3 on the Billboard Hot 100 singles chart in May 1976. The record was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America on June 23, 1976. In Canada, the song reached number 22 on the singles chart and number 8 on the Adult Contemporary chart. The song became a Gold record. Based on his work with Bishop, Thomas was invited to become the lead singer for Jefferson Starship. T. G. Sheppard had a #21 country hit with a cover of the song in 1985. The song is featured in the films Queens Logic (1991), Illtown (1996), Boogie Nights (1997), Summer of Sam (1999), Big Daddy (1999), According to Spencer (2001), The Devil's Rejects (2005), The Family Stone (2005), Invincible (2006), The Education of Charlie Banks (2007), Harold & Kumar Escape from Guantanamo Bay (2008), Stand Up Guys (2012), Lovelace (2013) and Guardians of the Galaxy (2014)."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"Harry Patch (In Memory Of)\" is a song by the English alternative rock band Radiohead. The band wrote and recorded the song as a tribute to the British supercentenarian Harry Patch, the last surviving soldier to have fought in the trenches during World War I. The song was self-released on 5 August 2009 as a downloadable single and sold for \u00A31 from the band's website, with all proceeds donated to The Royal British Legion. Recorded in an abbey shortly after Patch's death, the song consists of Thom Yorke's singing and a string arrangement composed by Jonny Greenwood, absent of Radiohead's typical mix of rock and electronic instrumentation. The lyrics are from the perspective of a soldier in the First World War, and include modifications of quotations from Patch. While reception to the song was generally positive, with many critics praising the song's message, others panned the song as overly sombre. The Patch family voiced their approval of the song's message and the band's charitable use of the proceeds."@en ;

It was released in August 1995 as the sixth single from his album When Love Finds You. It is a eulogic ballad. Gill began writing the song following the death of country music superstar Keith Whitley, who died in 1989. Gill did not finish the song until a few years later following the death of his older brother Bob, in 1993, of a heart attack. Ricky Skaggs and Patty Loveless both sang background vocals on the record. The song won the CMA's Song of the Year award in 1996 and a BMI Most-Performed Song award in 1997. It also received two Grammy Awards for Best Male Country Vocal Performance and Best Country Song in the 38th Grammy Awards. The single reached No. 14 on the Country Singles chart in 1995. It has sold 648,000 digital copies in the US since becoming available for download. On May 2, 2013, Gill performed the song with Patty Loveless at the funeral of fellow country artist George Jones. At one point during the performance, Gill became too emotional to sing some of the words, but was able to complete the song by focusing primarily on his guitar playing. In a speech just prior to their performance, Gill underlined their duet by stating that he always was aware of a \"special anointing\" in his duets with Loveless, and compared them particularly to Jones' duets with singer Melba Montgomery during the 1960s."@en ;

Initially presented as an audio stream to those who joined her web site's official mailing list in September 2009, it was released via digital download later that month, on September 22, 2009, as the lead and only single from Number Ones by A&M Records. \"Make Me\" features an up-tempo disco beat and lyrical hook reminiscent of her material from the 1980s. The song received critical praise, with music critics comparing the song favorably to her hit \"All for You\" (2001) and her brother Michael Jackson's 1979 number one single \"Don't Stop 'til You Get Enough\", both of which carry a distinct disco beat. It became her 19th number one hit single on the Billboard's Hot Dance Club Songs chart, and made her the first artist to earn number one singles on the chart across four decades. The song's music video, directed by Robert Hales, was shot entirely in black and white, and it received positive critical reception for its vintage aesthetic."@en ;

Co-written and produced by Jackson and her long-time collaborators Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis, it is the first record to be released under Jackson's independent label Rhythm Nation, distributed by BMG Rights Management. It was made available for digital download on June 22, 2015, in addition to vinyl copies being sold on Jackson's official website in conjunction with pre-sale orders for the studio album and Unbreakable World Tour concert tickets. Lyrically, the song depicts Jackson longing to reunite with her lover, anticipating that when she does, the couple will get \"no sleep.\" Due to its slow tempo and sentimentality, it has been described as embodying traits of quiet storm, a radio format. It was well received by music critics, who praised the song for its sultry aesthetic; reviewers complemented Jackson's vocals, as well as the song's subtle production style, noting that it appeared to be a conscientious choice on her part and that of her producers to avoid contemporary musical trends. The album version of the song features additional verses from American rapper J. Cole. It was released to radio airplay and made available for digital download on July 23, 2015. Its official music video premiered on Today on July 24, 2015. Directed by Dave Meyers, its minimalist aesthetic and production has been compared to the music video for \"That's the Way Love Goes\" (1993). Jackson's solo version of the single debuted on the US Billboard Hot 100 at number 67, marking her 40th entry on the chart. It also debuted on the US Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs at number 18. The album version featuring J. Cole enabled it to re-enter the Hot 100 with a new peak position at number 63, while also topping the US Adult R&B Songs chart."@en ;

In an interview Cheryl James (aka 'Salt') stated she considers herself a feminist \"in a way\", emphasizing the need for women to avoid complete emotional and financial dependence on men. Songs like \"Tramp\" and \"Shake Your Thang\" express these feminist themes of female autonomy."@en ;

The song was also released as the A-side to the group's second single, which was distributed on January 21, 1967. Like many of Bonniwell's compositions, \"The People In Me\"'s lyrical content featured a gloomy rebellious mood, with eerie lead vocals by Bonniwell, and it explored with a hard-edged variation of psychedelic rock. It also featured guitarist Mark Landon's wiry distorted guitar melodies, joined by backing vocals near the conclusion of the song. \"The People In Me\", with the flip side \"Masculine Intutition\", was the final Music Machine single to chart on the Billboard Hot 100, where it peaked at number 66. Though it was considered a strong follow-up to their debut release \"Talk Talk\", the song suffered from inadequate airplay when the band's management angered radio producers for exclusively airing the single on a rival station. Bonniwell would pen much more experimental compositions, but the dispute damaged The Music Machine's prospects for another charting hit."@en ;

The song marks a new musical direction for Mauboy as it is a departure from her usual pop and R&B style. \"This Ain't Love\" received mostly positive reviews from music critics, who complimented Mauboy's vocals and the production, and believed that the song had potential to do well on international charts. They also noted that it was reminiscent of artists such as Rudimental, Disclosure and Ella Eyre. Upon its release, \"This Ain't Love\" debuted at number 41 on the Australian ARIA Singles Chart; it later peaked at number 5 and became Mauboy's ninth top-ten single. \"This Ain't Love\" was certified gold by the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) for shipments of 35,000 copies.

	dbo:abstract	"\"Too Hurt to Cry, Too Much in Love to Say Goodbye\" is a 1963 song and single written and composed by Motown's main production team Holland\u2013Dozier\u2013Holland. Credited to the Darnells the performers on both sides of the singles were in fact the Andantes (both sides), Holland\u2013Dozier\u2013Holland (B-Side only), Mary Wilson of the Supremes (B-Side), and members of the Marvelettes (A-side only), the Four Tops, and the Temptations (both on the B-Side). Nobody involved with the production on either side was pleased with the false credit. Whatever the reason it was done, it didn't work as the single only peaked at 17 on the Billboard Bubbling Under Hot 100 charts. The song on the A-Side has the narrator the audience of the emotional pain she experiences after seeing her lover kissing and holding another girl across the room (and he didn\u2019t notice she was there). The A-Side is now officially considered both a Marvelettes single, and the first of two official singles by the Andantes by the Motown company. Marvelettes lead singer Gladys Horton is the main lead on the song, with her groupmate Wanda Young and Andantes member Louvain Demps on harmony co-lead. For the Marvelettes this recording would be similar to some of their later songs (as wells as songs by the Supremes, the Vandellas, and the Velvelettes), in which the only group members heard on the songs are the ones singing lead. In the Andantes' case Demps' harmony vocals on this song, and her group's backing chime-offs on Mary Wells' \"My Guy\" and Marvin Gaye's \"Ain't That Peculiar\", would be the closest any member of the group would get to front any recording at Motown; as they would not be allowed to even sing main lead on neither side on this single, nor their follow-up \"(Like A) Nightmare\" b/w \"If You Were Mine\". The Supremes would later record their own version in 1965, intended for their album More Hits by The Supremes, but it wouldn't be released until 1987, when it was placed on their compilation album, The Never-Before-Released Masters."@en ;

Co-written and produced by William \"Mickey\" Stevenson and Ivy Jo Hunter, the single became the Detroit-reared group's second to chart on the company label, and the fourth to chart altogether. It was also the last to chart in the 1960s and last to chart for the group until \"It's a Shame\". The single peaked at 11 on the Billboard Bubbling Under Hot 100 charts.However, on the Billboard R&B singles chart, \"Truly Yours\" was a Top 20 hit,peaking at number 16. During this period, as Motown treated the group as a second-tier signing, the label released one single a year from 1964 to 1969 only. Thus commercial success would elude the group until 1970. The song was later covered in 1967 by the The Temptations and Hunter himself. The Temptations version would unreleased until 1986, while Hunter version, backed by The Temptations, would be released on January 12, 2005."@en ;

It was also No.1 in Ireland, No.3 in Australia and No.2 in Canada.

In 1993, \"Glad All Over\" was reissued as a single in the UK, coupled with \"Good Old Rock \u2019n \u2019Roll\" and \"Having a Wild Weekend\".

The record reached number one on both the Billboard Hot 100 on July 10, 1961 and R&B chart and has since become a standard on oldies compilations. It was named the number-one single on the Billboard chart for 1961, after spending seven consecutive weeks at the top. It was featured on the soundtrack for the 1978 film Animal House. On the original hit single version, the track begins with Lewis singing \"I couldn't sleep at all last night,\" and it appears this way on most oldies compilations. However, on some releases the song has a prelude, where Lewis sings \"Baby...Baby...you did something to me,\" followed by a musical cue into the first verse. Lewis usually includes this prelude when he performs the song live. The personnel on the original hit recording included Ritchie Adams and Eric Gale on guitar, Bob Bushnell on bass, King Curtis on a tenor sax mouthpiece, Frank Haywood Henry on baritone sax, Paul Griffin on Piano, and Sticks Evans on drums. In 2008, Billboard magazine ranked the song as the 27th biggest song of all time that charted on the Billboard Hot 100, commemorating the 50th anniversary of the chart. It is one of only six songs from the 1960s to spend at least seven weeks in the number one position on the Billboard Hot 100."@en ;

With music composed by Fall Out Boy vocalist and guitarist Patrick Stump and lyrics penned by bassist Pete Wentz, the song was one of the two tracks produced by Babyface (who was referenced in the song), the other being single \"Thnks fr th Mmrs\". This song was played on VH1's V-Spot acoustic sessions along with \"Thnks fr th Mmrs\", \"This Ain't a Scene, It's an Arms Race\", and \"Sugar, We're Goin Down\", all of which were successful singles. Wentz characterized Stump\u2019s vocal performance on the song as \"straight-up Motown\", continuing to say \"If there wasn't a rock band playing, it'd be straight R&B, and he'd go on tour with just an upright bass and a drum and open up for R.

	dbo:abstract	"\"Baby Come On Home\" is a song by English rock band Led Zeppelin.

The song was also included on the CD edition of the band's ninth studio album Coda in The Complete Studio Recordings (1993) and Definitive Collection Mini LP Replica CD Boxset (2008). In 2015, the song was included on disc one of the two companion discs of the reissue of Coda. The track stems from an old master reel labelled 'Yardbirds. October 10, 1968' (Led Zeppelin were called the \"New Yardbirds\" during their first months of existence). The master tape went missing for a number of years and allegedly turned up in a refuse bin outside Olympic Studios, following renovations in 1991. It was mixed by Mike Fraser for a much belated release in 1993, with a single to promote the Boxed Set 2. The song was originally recorded under the title \"Tribute to Bert Berns\", in honour of the American songwriter and producer who had died in December 1967. On this track, Jimmy Page played guitar through a Leslie speaker and John Paul Jones played piano and a Hammond organ."@en ;

The single was released by CBS. \"Don't You Ever Leave Me\" made its first appearance on Hanoi Rocks' first album Bangkok Shocks, Saigon Shakes, Hanoi Rocks, but it had more punky atmosphere and faster tempo. They remade the version, which the band loved much more. It is usually considered one of the best songs by Hanoi Rocks. The band's guitarist Andy McCoy commented on the song in Finnish Soundi magazine in 1984: \"Well, yeah, we screwed up that song so bad back then, that we had to remake it now. As a song, I think it's fucking great and this version is what the original should have been.\". The version of \"Don't You Ever Leave Me\" that's on the 12\" single differs from the album and 7\" single versions, as the 12\" single version features the narration's (originally spoken by McCoy and Razzle) spoken by McCoy in Spanish. The song \"Oil And Gasoline\" (which was the song's B-side) was a new song that originally made its appearance on the \"Underwater World\" single the same year in 1984. \"Malibu Nightmare\" (which is on the 12\" single) was originally featured on the EP for the song \"Love's An Injection\" in 1982. The song was originally made just as a joke, which had Nasty Suicide on bass, because Sam Yaffa was late from the recording. It was re-recorded on the band's 1983 album Back to Mystery City.

It was voted from a poll of 500,000 votes to be ranked number 83 on the list of the Hottest 100 of All Time in July 2009, conducted by Australian radio station Triple J. Croatian metal band Ashes You Leave covered \"Every You Every Me\" on their 2009 album Songs of the Lost. Along with the rest of the album (apart from \"Pure Morning\"), \"Every You Every Me\" was recorded in early 1998 at Real World Studios with Steve Osborne. When asked who it was about, Molko replied with \"Who's it about? I'm not really too sure just yet. I think it's about a lot of people. Probably anybody... everybody who's had the displeasure of sleeping with me.\" About his choice to include it in the Cruel Intentions soundtrack, Molko said that he \"studied drama, I know the original (Dangerous Liaisons) and we watched it on the tour bus when they wanted to use our song. I said: 'If he doesn't die in the end, if it's a happy ending, we don't do it.' It's quite perverted and manipulative, so the theme of the song fits in quite well.\" The song was also used in EA Sports F1 2000."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"Favourite Things\" is a single released in 2003 by the UK hip hop/R&B group Big Brovaz. The single is a track on Big Brovaz's 2002 debut album, Nu-Flow. Nu-Flow was re-released for a third time only six weeks after the previous re-issue to include \"Favourite Things\", which was not contained on either of the previous two issues of the album. \"Favourite Things\" became Big Brovaz' third UK top ten hit, peaking at number two and spending three months inside the top seventy-five of the UK Singles Chart. It is their highest charting single in the UK. Despite \"OK\" being a failure in Australia, \"Favourite Things\" returned the group to the top ten of the Australian singles chart, peaking at number three, matching the peak of the group's debut single \"Nu Flow\", and receiving a Gold certification. The song received positive reviews and one of the reasons for the song's relative success is the fact that it is based upon a popular song from the musical The Sound of Music, \"My Favourite Things\". The single follows the same basic tune of the original song, and focuses on typically expensive and glamorous objects that the women of the group are wanting, such as diamonds, rubies, expensive cars such as Bentleys and designer clothes such as Gucci - this is ironic, as the song that it is based on typically focusses on thoroughly simple and non-glamorous pleasures. The group also recorded a version of the original \"My Favourite Things\" song, including it as a bonus hidden track on their debut album and also featuring it on the CD single of \"Favourite Things\".

The song is the second track on the album's second side, with the song \"Cinema\" serving as a form of introduction."@en ;
