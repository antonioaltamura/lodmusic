	dbo:abstract	"Embrace was a short-lived post-hardcore band from Washington, D.C., which lasted from the summer of 1985 to the spring of 1986. Along with Rites of Spring, and Beefeater, it was one of the mainstay acts of the 1985 Revolution Summer movement, and was one of the first bands to be dubbed in the press as emotional hardcore, though the members had rejected the term since its creation. The band included lead vocalist Ian MacKaye of the defunct hardcore punk act Minor Threat and three former members of his brother Alec's band, the Faith: guitarist Michael Hampton, drummer Ivor Hanson, and bassist Chris Bald. Hampton and Hanson had also previously played together in S.O.A. The band played their last show at the 9:30 Club in March 1986. The only recording released by the quartet was their posthumous 1987 self-titled album, Embrace, being influenced by the Faith EP Subject to Change. Following the breakup of Embrace, MacKaye and ex-Minor Threat drummer, Jeff Nelson, tried turning their recent one-off musical experiment in England, dubbed \"Egg Hunt\", into an actual band, but the project never surpassed the rehearsal stage. Hampton, for his part, teamed up with former members of Rites of Spring to form the short-lived post-hardcore outfit One Last Wish, while Bald moved on to the band Ignition. MacKaye eventually directed his energy and creativity toward the forming of Fugazi in 1987, and Ivor Hanson would pair up with Hampton again in 1988 for Manifesto. During the band's formative years, some fans started referring to them and fellow innovators Rites of Spring as emocore (emotive hardcore) bands, a term MacKaye publicly disagreed with."@en ;

The band was founded by songwriter and guitarist Zulfiqar J. Khan, vocalist, songwriter Fawad Afzal Khan and keyboardist and vocalist Ahmed Ali Butt who were soon joined by Salman Albert on guitars, Abid Khan on drums, Hassaan Khalid on rhythm guitars and Waqar Ahmed on drums, since then there had been many changes in the line-up the only consistent members being Ahmed Ali Butt, Salman Albert and Hassaan Khalid. Their music is categorized as being associated with both progressive metal and progressive rock, yet having been heavily influenced by nu metal and psychedelic rock music. The band is also heavily influenced with western bands like Metallica, Megadeth, Limp Bizkit, Rage Against the Machine, Tool, Linkin Park and Oleander, amongst other western music rock artists. The band are noted for being one of the pioneer mainstream rock bands in the Pakistani music industry. Their debut album, Irtiqa, released in 2003, is the first mainstream concept album to be released by a Pakistani artist. The album produced by Zulfiqar J. Khan, Fawad Khan and Mekaal Hasan, was a critical acclaim in Pakistan. In 2007, Entity Paradigm had an interview with a local newspaper in which they announced that the band would disband due to various members aiming to pursue different projects. Early reports from the band hinted towards an album release in late 2004. In 2009, the band announced their official comeback with Fawad Afzal Khan and Ahmed Ali Butt in leading positions. However, two of the main members of the band, Zulfiqar J. Khan and Sajjad A. Khan, decided not to make a comeback due to work on different projects. Qirat Hamed covered their song Bolo Bolo. Fawad Khan in an interview to renowned journalist Adil Mansoor said that Qirats version was better than the bands."@en ;

Through their first two line-ups they were managed by the writer and music critic Michael Gray, shortly after his personal management of Gerry Rafferty. Hence the band's first single was produced by Rafferty's co-producer Hugh Murphy. The band continued with changing line-ups until 1989, with later incarnations releasing records under the names F.O.C. and Buzzcocks F.O.C. The final incarnation of the band included former member of The Stone Roses Andy Couzens and former Inspiral Carpets drummer Chris Goodwin, who both went on to form The High. The band ended when Diggle joined Pete Shelley in a re-formed Buzzcocks, the reunion prompted by controversy over the use of \"Buzzcocks\" in the billing of Diggle's band. In a review of the 'best of' compilation The Secret Public Years 1981-1989, Allmusic described the later F.O.C. work as proof that Diggle was \"one of the most important and overlooked artists in all of Britain during the '80s\"."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Gladys Knight & the Pips were an R&B/soul family musical act from Atlanta, Georgia that remained active on the music charts and performing circuit for three decades. Starting out as simply The Pips in 1952, derived from a cousin's nickname, the founding members were Gladys Knight, brother Merald \"Bubba\" Knight, sister Brenda Knight and cousins William and Eleanor Guest. After a couple years performing in talent shows, the group signed with Brunswick Records in 1957, recording a couple of singles that failed to chart. Brenda Knight and Eleanor Guest were eventually replaced by another cousin, Edward Patten and a non-relative, Langston George in 1959. This lineup produced the group's first hit single, \"Every Beat of My Heart\". After the single was released on three different labels, they changed their name to Gladys Knight & the Pips in 1961. Langston George left the same year and Gladys Knight left in 1962 to start a family with musician Jimmy Newman. Knight rejoined in 1964 and this lineup continued until the group's disbandment in 1989. The group reached commercial success after signing with Motown Records in 1966. Struggling for a year and a half and being treated as a second-string act in the label, the group recorded the first hit single version of \"I Heard It Through the Grapevine\" in 1967, which led to several hit singles for Motown's Soul Records label, including \"Nitty Gritty\", \"Friendship Train\", \"If I Were Your Woman\" and \"Neither One of Us (Wants to Be the First to Say Goodbye)\", before leaving the label for Buddah Records in 1973, where they recorded the hits \"Best Thing That Ever Happened to Me\", \"I've Got to Use My Imagination\" and their number-one hit single, \"Midnight Train to Georgia\". Contractual difficulties with their labels forced the group to record side projects until 1980 when they signed with Columbia Records. Later hits included \"Save the Overtime (For Me)\" and the Grammy-winning single \"Love Overboard\". In 1989, the group disbanded with the Pips retiring and Knight embarking on a successful solo career. Gladys Knight & the Pips are multiple Grammy and American Music Award winners and are inductees into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and the Vocal Group Hall of Fame in 1996 and 2001 respectively."@en ;

Notable band members have included Didier Malherbe, Pip Pyle, Steve Hillage, Mike Howlett, Pierre Moerlen, Bill Laswell and Theo Travis. Others who have played on stage with Gong include Don Cherry, Chris Cutler, Bill Bruford, Brian Davison, Dave Stewart and Tatsuya Yoshida. Gong released its debut album, Magick Brother, in 1970, which featured a psychedelic pop sound. By the following year, the second album, Camembert Electrique, featured the more psychedelic rock/space rock sound with which they would be most associated. Between 1973 and 1974, Gong released their best known work, the allegorical Radio Gnome Invisible trilogy, describing the adventures of Zero the Hero, the Good Witch Yoni and the Pot Head Pixies from the Planet Gong. In 1975, Daevid Allen & Gilli Smyth left the band, which continued without them, releasing a series of jazz rock albums under the leadership of drummer Pierre Moerlen. This incarnation of the band became known as Pierre Moerlen's Gong. Meanwhile, Smyth formed Mother Gong while Allen initiated a series of spin-off groups, including Planet Gong, New York Gong and Gongmaison, before returning to lead Gong once again in 1990 until his death in 2015. With Allen's encouragement, the band decided to continue and released the album Rejoice! I'm Dead! on 16 September 2016."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Guns N' Roses is an American hard rock band from Los Angeles formed in 1985. The classic lineup, as signed to Geffen Records in 1986, consisted of vocalist Axl Rose, lead guitarist Slash, rhythm guitarist Izzy Stradlin, bassist Duff McKagan, and drummer Steven Adler. The current lineup consists of Rose, Slash, McKagan, keyboardists Dizzy Reed and Melissa Reese, guitarist Richard Fortus and drummer Frank Ferrer. The band has released six studio albums, accumulating sales of more than 100 million records worldwide, including shipments of 45 million in the United States, making Guns N' Roses one of the world's best-selling bands of all time. Guns N' Roses' debut album, Appetite for Destruction (1987), reached number one on the Billboard 200 a year after its release, on the strength of \"Sweet Child o' Mine\", the group's only single to reach number one on the Billboard Hot 100. The album has sold approximately 30 million copies worldwide, including 18 million units in the United States, making it the best-selling debut album of all time in the US, as well as the eleventh best-selling album in the United States. The success of the debut was followed by the eight-song album G N' R Lies (1988) which reached number two on the Billboard 200. The twin albums Use Your Illusion I and Use Your Illusion II (1991) debuted at number two and number one on the Billboard 200 respectively and have sold a combined 35 million copies worldwide, including 14 million units in the United States. The cover album \"The Spaghetti Incident?\" (1993) was the band's last studio album to feature Slash and McKagan. After more than a decade of work and several lineup changes, Guns N' Roses released the long-awaited album Chinese Democracy (2008) which, at an estimated $14 million in production costs, is the most expensive rock album to ever be produced in music history. It debuted at number three on the Billboard 200 but undersold industry expectations, despite mostly positive critical reception. Classic era members Slash and McKagan both rejoined the band in 2016. Guns N' Roses has been credited with reviving the mainstream popularity of rock music, at a time when popular music was dominated by dance music and glam metal. Its late 1980s and early 1990s years have been described as the period in which the group brought forth a \"hedonistic rebelliousness\" reminiscent of the early Rolling Stones, a reputation that had earned the group the nickname \"the most dangerous band in the world\". The band's classic lineup, along with later members Reed and drummer Matt Sorum, was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2012, in its first year of eligibility."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"HIM (previously known as HER in the United States) is a rock band from Helsinki, Finland. The band was formed in the early 1990s by vocalist Ville Valo and bassist Mikko \"Mige\" Paananen under the name His Infernal Majesty. The band broke up in 1993, but was reformed in 1995 by Valo and guitarist Mikko \"Linde\" Lindstr\u00F6m. After being rejoined by Mige, as well as keyboardist Antto Melasniemi and drummer Juhana \"P\u00E4tk\u00E4\" Rantala, the band, now called HIM, released their debut album Greatest Love Songs Vol. 666 in 1997. In 2000, now with drummer Mika \"Gas Lipstick\" Karppinen and keyboardist Juska Salminen, the band released the album Razorblade Romance, which reached the number-one spot in Finland, Austria and Germany. Its first single, \"Join Me in Death\", also charted at number-one in Finland and Germany, eventually going platinum in their home country. Following the addition of Janne \"Burton\" Puurtinen on keyboards, HIM released Deep Shadows and Brilliant Highlights and Love Metal in 2001 and 2003, respectively. Both cracked the top ten in several countries, with latter being the band's first album to chart in the UK. After relocating to Los Angeles, HIM released Dark Light in 2005, which became the group's most successful album to date, cracking the top ten in five countries. With Dark Light, HIM also became the first-ever Finnish group to receive a gold album in the United States. Dark Light was followed by Venus Doom in 2007, the making of which was marred by personal problems faced by Valo. Despite this, the album gave the band their highest chart position ever in the US at number 12. After 2010's Screamworks: Love in Theory and Practice, HIM were put on hiatus, after drummer Gas Lipstick was diagnosed with a repetitive stress injury and nerve damage in his hands. Following several months of uncertainty, the band regrouped and eventually released the album Tears on Tape in 2013. In 2015, Gas Lipstick announced his departure from the band after 16 years, to pursue other musical projects. He was subsequently replaced by Jukka \"Kosmo\" Kr\u00F6ger. HIM is internationally one of the most commercially successful Finnish bands of all time, with seven platinum and over ten gold albums, and sales of over six million records. The band have released eight studio albums, six compilations, three video releases, and one live and one remix album. HIM's music and their logo, the heartagram, have also appeared in several films and TV series, such as The Thirteenth Floor, Transformers, Viva La Bam and LA Ink."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Heart is an American rock band that first found success in Canada and later in the United States and worldwide. Over the group's four-decade history, it has had three primary lineups, with the constant center of the group since 1974 being sisters Ann Wilson (lead singer) and Nancy Wilson (guitarist). Heart rose to fame in the mid-1970s with hits \"Magic Man\" and \"Barracuda\" as music influenced by hard rock and heavy metal, as well as folk music. Their popularity declined in the early 1980s, but the band enjoyed a comeback starting in 1985 and experienced even greater success with album-oriented rock hits and hard-rock ballads into the 1990s. With Jupiter's Darling (2004), Red Velvet Car (2010), Fanatic (2012), and Beautiful Broken (2016) Heart made a return to its hard rock and acoustic folk roots. To date, Heart has sold over 35 million records worldwide, including over 22.5 million in album sales in the U.S. The group was ranked number 57 on VH1's \"100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock\". With Top 10 albums on the Billboard Album Chart in the 1970s, 1980s, 1990s, and 2010s, Heart is among the most commercially enduring hard rock bands in history. They were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2013. Since 2002, the band has had six members."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Iced Earth is an American heavy metal band from Tampa, Florida. It was formed in 1985 under the name Purgatory by guitarist and main songwriter Jon Schaffer and original drummer Greg Seymour. Iced Earth released their debut album in 1990 and have since released eleven studio albums, four EPs, three compilations, three box sets, three live albums and one cover album. After releasing their first two studio albums in 1990 and 1991, respectively, Iced Earth took a three-year layoff from 1992 to 1995, after which the band returned with new lead vocalist Matt Barlow. Iced Earth went on to release four studio albums with Barlow between 1995 and 2001, respectively; 1995's Burnt Offerings, 1996's The Dark Saga, 1998's Something Wicked This Way Comes and 2001's Horror Show. After Horror Show, Barlow quit the band and joined the police force, while Iced Earth continued on with Tim \"Ripper\" Owens, of Judas Priest fame, on vocals. With Owens, the band released two studio albums (2004's The Glorious Burden and 2007's Framing Armageddon). In late 2007, Matt Barlow rejoined the band. Iced Earth recorded the album The Crucible of Man with Barlow in 2008. In 2011 Barlow left the band again. Later that year, Into Eternity frontman Stu Block became Iced Earth's new lead vocalist. Dystopia, Block's first album with the group, was released in October 2011. It received a positive response; some critics called Dystopia one of Iced Earth's best albums. Block's second album with the group, Plagues of Babylon, was released in January 2014. Before arriving at their current lineup, Iced Earth has had numerous line-up changes, with founder Jon Schaffer staying as the last remaining member. As of 2013, there have been over twenty musicians in and out of Iced Earth since its formation in 1985 (see: List of Iced Earth band members for more details). Currently, the band is composed of rhythm guitarist Jon Schaffer, lead guitarist Jake Dreyer, singer Stu Block, bassist Luke Appleton and drummer Brent Smedley."@en ;

Previous bassists for the band include John Nichols from 1993 to 1994; Zak Sally from 1994 to 2005 and Matt Livingston from 2005 to 2008. The music of Low is characterized by slow tempos and minimalist arrangements. Early descriptions sometimes referred to it as a rock subgenre called \"slowcore\" often compared to the band Bedhead, who played this style during the 1980s and early 1990s. However, Low's members ultimately disapproved of the term. Parker and Sparhawk's striking vocal harmonies represent perhaps the group's most distinctive element; critic Denise Sullivan writes that their shared vocals are \"as chilling as anything Gram and Emmylou ever conspired on\u2014though that's not to say it's country-tinged, just straight from the heart.\""@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Machine Gun Fellatio was an Australian alternative rock band, formed in 1997. They were well known for their provocative on-stage antics and humorous lyrics, as well as the musical merit of their songs. Their outrage-provoking name (coined by an early associate of the band who devised the term from a philosophy exercise) gives some idea of the attitude that pervades the band's work. They released three studio albums, three EPs and three singles before breaking up in 2005."@en ;

The distinction was that while The Shadows were famous for their instrumental work, Marvin Welch & Farrar were a trio, vocal harmony group. They have been favourably compared to USA folk close harmony group Crosby Stills Nash and Young (aka CSNY) and The Hollies. Their second album, Second Opinion (1971), produced by Peter Vince, was voted as one of the best ever sounding albums recorded at Abbey Road studios by EMI Records' sound engineers in a private poll during the 1970s."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"The Modern Jazz Quartet (MJQ) was a jazz combo established in 1952 that played music influenced by classical, cool jazz, blues and bebop. The band performed over a 40-year span with only one personnel change. For the majority of their career the group comprised John Lewis (piano and musical director), Milt Jackson (vibraphone), Percy Heath (double bass) and Connie Kay (drums). Under Lewis's leadership they carved their own niche by specializing in elegant, restrained music that used sophisticated counterpoint yet nonetheless retained a strong blues feel. Lewis firmly believed that J.S. Bach and the blues were compatible, combining classical form with jazz improvisation and polyphony. The band was also noted for its ability to play alongside a variety of other groups. Initially active into the 1970s until Jackson quit due to creative disagreement and frustration with their busy touring schedule in 1974, the MJQ reformed intermittently into the 1990s."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Neutral Milk Hotel was an American indie rock band formed in Ruston, Louisiana by singer, guitarist, and songwriter Jeff Mangum in the late 1980s. The band is noted for its experimental sound, abstract lyrics and eclectic instrumentation. The first release under the Neutral Milk Hotel moniker was the 1994 EP Everything Is, a short collection of tracks featuring Mangum. On the band's full-length debut album On Avery Island, which followed shortly thereafter, Mangum was joined by childhood friend and Apples in Stereo frontman Robert Schneider, who contributed production and instrumentation. Upon the album's release, the full band was formed and extensive touring began. Neutral Milk Hotel released In the Aeroplane Over the Sea in 1998, which became their best-known and most critically acclaimed album. Although the album did not meet commercial success at the time of release, it has gone on to sell over 300,000 copies and received critical acclaim from several publications, including Pitchfork Media, Magnet Magazine, AllMusic, and The Pazz & Jop poll. Despite growing popularity, the group disbanded in 1999 after Mangum became disenchanted with touring and the music press, later having a nervous breakdown. Neutral Milk Hotel is a part of the Elephant 6 Recording Company. The band was one of Elephant 6's three first projects, alongside The Apples in Stereo and The Olivia Tremor Control. On April 29, 2013, the band announced a reunion tour for the fall of 2013 with the lineup that played on In the Aeroplane Over the Sea via their record label's website."@en ;

The original line-up consisted of Simon Oakes, Rob Havis, Ben Durling and Justin Chancellor. Peach supported the band Tool on the European leg of their tours throughout 1993\u20131994 after the release of Undertow, and then released an album, Giving Birth to a Stone, themselves. After touring to promote their debut album, Peach recorded a second one, Volume II. It was never released due to a failure to secure a major record deal. In 1995 Oakes quit to form Geyser with Al Murray (prior to his comedy career), but Peach continued with replacement singer Rod Sterling. Rob Havis later left for fellow Tool support act Submarine (later to become JetBoy DC), and the name Peach was then dropped in favour of Sterling. Chancellor left the band to join Tool in 1995, after Tool's first bassist, Paul D'Amour, left. Sterling signed a deal with Mantra Records and released an album (Monster Lingo) and had four singles. In 2000, Giving Birth to a Stone was reissued to relative success on the DC Based Beatville Records imprint Vile Beat. In response to its popularity, Oakes and Havis decided to form a band again. With Durling and Chancellor still with other bands, they chose to perform instead under the name Suns of the Tundra.

Built around the vocals of singer Toby Martin and production of Wayne Connolly, the sound of Youth Group is reminiscent of indie rock artists such as Teenage Fanclub, Pavement and Death Cab for Cutie. The band formed in Sydney in the late 1990s and has released four albums, three of which have gained worldwide release. They achieved major success in 2006 when their cover of Alphaville's \"Forever Young\", which had been recorded for the soundtrack of the US TV drama The O.C., was released as a single and reached No. 1 in Australia, attaining platinum status. As of 2015, the band is signed to Ivy League Records."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Zapp (also known as the Zapp Band or Zapp & Roger) is an American funk band that emerged from Hamilton, Ohio, in 1977. Particularly influential in the electro subgenre of funk, Zapp served as partial inspiration toward the creation of the G-funk sound of hip-hop popular on the West Coast of the United States in the early to mid 1990s, with many of their songs sampled by numerous hip-hop artists. The original line-up consisted of four brothers\u2014Roger Troutman, Larry Troutman, Lester Troutman and Terry Troutman\u2014and non-Troutman family members Bobby Glover, Gregory Jackson, Sherman Fleetwood, Jerome Derrickson, Eddie Barber and Jannetta Boyce. The group received attention in the early 1980s for implementing heavy use of the talk-box, which became one of their most well known characteristics. Zapp worked closely with members George Clinton and Bootsy Collins of the band Parliament-Funkadelic during its early stages, their support being a factor in the group gaining a record deal with Warner Bros. Records in 1979. Zapp released its eponymous debut album in 1980, having a sound reminiscent of P-Funk as a result of Clinton's and Collins' input on the production. Zapp achieved most of its mainstream recognition from the single \"More Bounce to the Ounce\" from the same album, now widely regarded as a classic example of early 1980s electronic funk. The following year in 1981, Clinton stopped working with the band over a record dispute regarding Roger Troutman's solo debut. Zapp continued to produce several more albums thereafter, releasing Zapp II in 1982. The album's musical style veered drastically away from their first release; despite this, the album sold well, and was certified gold by late 1982. Zapp disbanded in 1999 after both Roger and Larry Troutman were killed in a murder-suicide, that was apparently carried out by Larry. Roger was shot several times before dying in hospital during surgery. Larry's body was found close-by in his vehicle with a single gunshot wound to the head. The motive behind Larry's attack is unclear, but there are speculations that there were arguments over money, and Larry being angry over the lack of consultation from Roger as to why he fired him from being his manager. Zapp reformed briefly in 2003 with the remaining brothers of the Troutman family to produce the album Zapp VI: Back By Popular Demand."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Pennywise is an American punk rock band from Hermosa Beach, California, United States, formed in 1988. The name is derived from the monster, It, from the Stephen King novel of the same title. Between their 1991 self-titled debut and 2005's The Fuse, Pennywise had released an album every two years on Epitaph Records, a label owned by Bad Religion guitarist Brett Gurewitz. To date, the band has released eleven full-length studio albums (the last being 2014's Yesterdays), one live album, two EPs and one DVD. Although their first two studio albums were critically acclaimed, Pennywise would not experience worldwide commercial success until the 1995 release of their third studio album, About Time, which peaked at number ninety-six on the Billboard 200, and number fifty-five on Australia's ARIA Charts. The band's mainstream success was signified by a growing interest in punk rock during the 1990s, along with fellow California bands NOFX, Rancid, Blink-182, Bad Religion, Green Day, The Offspring, Lagwagon and Sublime. By 2007, the band had independently sold over three million records worldwide, making them one of the most successful independent punk acts of all time. Pennywise's current line-up consists of Jim Lindberg (vocals), Fletcher Dragge (guitars), Randy Bradbury (bass) and Byron McMackin (drums). They had kept their original line-up together until bassist Jason Thirsk died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound in 1996, due to issues with his alcoholism, after which Bradbury joined as his replacement. In August 2009, Lindberg decided to leave the band; he was replaced in February 2010 by Ignite singer Zoli T\u00E9gl\u00E1s. With T\u00E9gl\u00E1s, the band recorded their tenth studio album All or Nothing, which was released on May 1, 2012. Lindberg rejoined the band later that year after T\u00E9gl\u00E1s was sidelined by a back injury."@en ;

The trio was formed in 1983 in Skopje, then SR Macedonia. The line up consisted of: Ana Kostovska (vocalist), Kiril D\u017Eajkovski (keyboards) and Ljubomir Stojsavljevi\u0107 (bass guitar). The author of their lyrics was the internationally acclaimed film director Mil\u010Do Man\u010Devski, at that time a correspondent of the magazines D\u017Euboks and Zdravo from New York City. He was also a director of their music video for the song Hot day in Mexico. The group recorded several songs in Macedonian language for the music production of the national Radio-Television Skopje. They released their debut self-titled album in 1984. Most of the songs on the record, which was released for PGP-RTB from Belgrade are in Serbo-Croat, because it was the most widespreaded language in the former Yugoslav federal market. After they disbanded, D\u017Eajkovski started to work with the prominent Macedonian rock band Leb i sol and played on their albums Kao Kakao and Putujemo. Ana Kostovska continued as a solo singer and actress. In 1987 she was a candidate from Macedonia at Jugovizija, the Yugoslav national pre-selection for the Eurovision Song Contest. In 2006 their first album was re-released on audio CD in Republic of Macedonia by Lithium Records, PMG Recordings and AG Records under the title Works and Rew>>works. The CD also included tribute cover versions recorded by several, mostly younger Macedonian bands and solo artists such as: Robotek, PMG Collective, Steel Temple and others."@en ;

Consisting of only two members, Yamantaka Eye of Boredoms (vocals) and Chew Hasegawa of Corrupted (drums), they released one infamous recording in 1996 called We Are Voice and Rhythm Only. This was actually a live recording of a concert in Osaka done as a support for Brutal Truth on their Japanese tour in February 1995. Running for little over 10 minutes, it nevertheless features 48 songs, the longest of which is \"24H?\" (39 seconds). Note that the song running times also include audience cheering and an introduction (\"Next song is...\") by Eye at the beginning and Eye's obligatory cry of \"Fankoo!\" (\"Thank you\") at the end. Apart from that, the songs consist mostly of Chew attacking his drum set and Eye screaming the track titles in Engrish at the top of his lungs, generally creating a lot of feedback (which is sometimes mistaken for guitars). The album also includes two cover versions: \"Beastie Boys\" (from the early Beastie Boys EP Pollywog Stew) and \"Nazi Punks Fuck Off!\" (originally by Dead Kennedys), although the vocals of these have been sped up somewhat (and the songs reduced to one verse and one chorus) to fit into 18 and 17 seconds, respectively."@en ;

In 1997, The LBC Crew was signed to Doggystyle Records, a label operated by Snoop and distributed through Snoop's then record label, Death Row Records. Their debut album titled \"Haven't You Heard\" was released in February 2011. During their time with Death Row, the LBC Crew recorded a previously unreleased album entitled 'Haven't U Heard...' which remained unreleased until February 8, 2011 when it was released by WideAwake/Death Row. They had a hit single with the song \"Beware Of My Crew\", from the A Thin Line Between Love and Hate soundtrack, which was originally intended to be for their debut album. They played on Snoop Dogg's second album Tha Doggfather. The group disbanded following the collapse of Death Row. Since then, unreleased material from the group emerged on the underground. The LBC Crew remained visible figures in West-Coast hip-hop. Bad Azz released two solo albums under the Doggy Style imprint. Tray Deee went on to larger fame as part of Snoop Dogg's Eastsidaz. Lil C-Style remained part of disorganized Death Row camp. And Techniec recently signed to The Game's The Black Wall Street Records then left to start his own label."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Lars Frederiksen and the Bastards was an American street punk band formed to release the songs that Lars had written. Their songs include subject matter consisting of drinking, fighting, drugs, sex, prostitutes, gangs, and street life. They are the side project band of Lars Frederiksen from Rancid. The band members are Lars Frederiksen (vocals and lead guitar), Gordy Carbone (also credited as \"Unknown Bastard\") (vocals), Jason Woods, aka Big Jay Bastard, (bass), Craig Leg (rhythm guitar) and Scott Abels (also credited as \"Skatty Punk Rock\") (drums). While Craig did not appear on the first album, he has always been a touring member of the band. The band was formed after Lars' friend and bandmate in Rancid, Tim Armstrong suggested writing songs about Lars and his friend Ben growing up in Campbell, California. The band was then put together as an outlet to release these songs, as well as covers of Billy Bragg's \"To Have and to Have Not\", Holland-Dozier-Holland's \"Leaving Here\" (which was also covered by Mot\u00F6rhead). This first album was named Lars Frederiksen and the Bastards. Lars and Tim then got together to write the second Bastards album, Viking, this time the focus being more on Lars' recent life (with the exception of the songs \"1%\", \"The Kids Are Quiet on Sharmon Palms\" and \"The Viking\".) after having \"got outta Campbell\". The album also included cover versions of The Blasters' \"Marie, Marie\" and the Anti-Nowhere League's \"For You\". The song \"Little Rude Girl\" was originally intended to be used as a Rancid song, slated to appear on an aborted split 7\" with Rancid and Richmond, VA punk band Avail on Lookout! Records. The album was mixed by Brett Gurewitz of Bad Religion. It is also currently stated that Lars has no intention of creating another \"Lars Frederiksen and the Bastards\" album."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"The Fastbacks were a Seattle punk rock band. Formed in 1979 by songwriter/guitarist Kurt Bloch (born August 28, 1960), and friends Lulu Gargiulo (guitar and vocals, born October 12, 1960) and Kim Warnick (bass and vocals, born April 7, 1959), they disbanded in 2001. Their sound mixed a generally punk rock approach to vocals and sound textures with poppy tunes and strong musicianship. Although these three band members remained fairly constant, they went through numerous drummers, including Duff McKagan, later of Guns N' Roses. MTV's web page on the Fastbacks says that estimates at the number of Fastbacks drummers \"range from 12 to 20.\" For most of the band's last decade, Mike Musburger filled this role, but other Fastbacks drummers before him (or when he took occasional breaks) included Bloch himself, Richard Stuverud (perhaps best known from War Babies, Fifth Angel and his collaborations with Pearl Jam's Jeff Ament, including Three Fish, Tres Mts. and RNDM), Nate Johnson and Rusty Willoughby (both of whom also played in both Flop and Pure Joy), John Moen (of the Dharma Bums, later of Steven Malkmus's Jicks and The Decemberists), Jason Finn (of the Presidents of the United States of America), Dan Peters of Mudhoney, and Tad Hutchison of the Young Fresh Fellows. Several of these people also served at times as drummers in The Squirrels, a similarly long-lived band, and the Fastbacks' sometime label-mates on PopLlama Records, who bring a similar mix of strong musicianship and punk attitude to even poppier material. Contributing to the band's breakup was Kim Warnick's move to the band Visqueen in 2001 through 2004. In summer 2010 Kim Warnick started a new band with Mikey Davis called Cali Giraffes. The Fastbacks reunited for a one-off live performance 8 July 2011 at the West Seattle Summer Music Festival, featuring the core trio of Kurt, Kim and Lulu, along with Mike Musburger on drums, their first official show together since their break-up a decade ago."@en ;

This lineup was intact on their debut, 'Goodfellas' which contained the hit \"Wobble Wobble\" produced by Carlos Stephens, which peaked at #17 in the U.S.; the album was noted for showing a more direct influence from New Orleans' bounce music sound than had earlier No Limit releases. After No Limit Records moved over from Priority Records to Universal Records, their lineup was altered from the first album titled Goodfellas, C-Murder was incarcerated, Mystikal who had left the label not long after the Goodfellas album was released was also incarcerated so the only returning members were Magic, Krazy, Master P & Silkk The Shocker. Their new line up consisted of Choppa, Curren$y, Krazy, Magic, Master P, Silkk The Shocker & T-Bo for their second album, Ballers, which includes the hit single Tight Whips.

AOE were a commercially successful Canadian rock band of the mid-90s. Their commercial breakthrough came with their independent EP Ugly in 1993, which spawned several hits and set the stage for the major label release of The Age of Electric in 1995. In 1996, the Dahle brothers released an album with their side project Limblifter, which was also commercially successful in Canada. The band then regrouped for Make a Pest a Pet in 1997. The album produced the radio rock hit \"Remote Control\", which peaked at No. 9 on Canada's Singles Chart and was later featured on MuchMusic's diamond certified compilation album, Big Shiny Tunes 2. Although the album was a hit, tensions within the band led the group to break up after a 1998 tour as the opening band for Our Lady Peace. Upon the break-up of Age of Electric, the brothers Kerns would go on to form Static in Stereo with other members including their brother Ryan. Kurt Dahle went on to work with The New Pornographers. Todd Kerns is now the bass player and backup vocalist with Slash's band The Conspirators.

Ceolt\u00F3ir\u00ED is the Irish word for musicians, and Cualann is the name of an area just outside Dublin where \u00D3 Riada lived. \u00D3 Riada's work with Ceolt\u00F3ir\u00ED Chualann is credited with revitalizing the use of the bodhr\u00E1n as a percussion instrument in Celtic music. In 1960 \u00D3 Riada was looking for musicians to perform music for the play \"The Song of the Anvil\" by Bryan MacMahon. Paddy Moloney, at the age of 20, was called to participate in the project, along with his friend Sean Potts on tin whistle, Sonny Brogan on accordion and John Kelly on fiddle. They rehearsed weekly in \u00D3 Riada's house in Galloping Green, on the outskirts of Dublin. Following its success, \u00D3 Riada had the idea of forming Ceolt\u00F3ir\u00ED Chualann, a band to play traditional Irish songs with accompaniment and traditional dance tunes and slow airs, arranged with instruments: harpsichord, bodhran, piano, fiddle, accordions, flute, pipes and whistles. The idea of actually arranging folk music, or dance music, had been done on at least one or two 78rpm recordings in the past, but they were folk tunes done in a classical way, highly orchestrated.Another aim was to revitalize the work of blind harpist and composer Turlough O'Carolan. The band was launched during the Dublin Theatre Festival in September 1960, at the Shelbourne Hotel, at an event called Reacaireacht an Riadaigh (\u00D3 Riada's Recital). Included in the program were traditional singers, writer Se\u00E1n \u00D3 R\u00EDord\u00E1in and poet Se\u00E1n \u00D3 Tuama. In March of the following year \u00D3 Riada recorded the first of a series of radio programmes for which he retained the name Reacaireacht an Riadaigh, and included music played by Ceolt\u00F3ir\u00ED Chualann. Soon after the band's formation, Peadar Mercier and Se\u00E1n Keane joined. Ceolt\u00F3ir\u00ED Chualann continued to play until 1969. During that year they recorded two albums, \u00D3 Riada and \u00D3 Riada Sa Gaiety. The latter of those two albums was not released until after 1971, when Se\u00E1n \u00D3 Riada died."@en ;

Active throughout the late\u20131970s and the 1980s, the group comprised members of the DeBarge family. The group originally consisted of Mark, Randy, and El, Bunny, James, and Bobby joined later. DeBarge released six studio albums, four of them with Motown's Gordy Records: The DeBarges (1981), All This Love (1982), In a Special Way (1983), and Rhythm of the Night (1985). The latter became the group's best-selling album and garnered the single \"Rhythm of the Night\", which neared the top of the Billboard Hot 100 in the United States. DeBarge entered its decline in 1986, when Bunny and El were offered solo deals with Motown and departed the group, and DeBarge was dropped from Motown soon afterward. The remaining members signed with Stripe Horse Records, an independent label, in 1987, which released their final studio album, Bad Boys. The group continued to perform for an additional two years, with Chico DeBarge joining the group in 1988. That year, Bobby and Chico were arrested for drug trafficking, and their convictions led to the group's dispersion in 1989, 10 years after its inception."@en ;

Though this has caused the band to be sometimes overlooked in relation to other Washington, D.C. hardcore acts, their stylistic diversity made them influential to later punk rock groups.

	dbo:abstract	"Hokus Pick (or Hokus Pick Manouver) was a Christian rock band that was together from 1988 to 1999. The four members of Hokus Pick met in Vancouver, British Columbia. Hokus Pick was well known for their quirky sense of humour, using sarcasm, satire, and general silliness to convey a deeper message. Hokus Pick toured extensively in Canada and the United States. The band opened for Steve Taylor's Squinternational tour in 1994 and played in Costa Rica in May 1998. The group released their final album in 1999, opting to spend more time with their families after more than a decade of recording and touring together. They have remained active in music ministry and the industry. The Encyclopedia of Contemporary Christian Music cites their song \"I'm So Happy\" as possibly the Greatest CCM song of all time. The song is a satire of simplistic lyrics often heard on Christian radio. It received heavy rotation on Christian stations. In October 2007 Hokus Pick received a Lifetime Achievement Award from the Canadian Gospel Music Association at the 29th Annual Covenant Awards in Calgary, Alberta. Hokus Pick then performed live and hosted the 30th Annual Covenant Awards on October 24, 2008. Rumours abounded that Hokus Pick was planning a comeback into music, after having been spotted in a secluded warehouse jamming together. Filmmaking company Transposition Films, composed of legendary members itself, avoided questions regarding their involvement in filming a documentary about the process."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"The Invisibl Skratch Piklz were a group of Filipino-American turntablists. The members of the group were originally hip-hop DJs, who were among the pioneers of the turntablism movement in the 1990s; turntablists create musical pieces by mixing samples from records, and by using multiple turntables as instruments. The group started in 1989 as Shadow of the Prophet, with DJ Qbert, Mix Master Mike, and DJ Apollo, who left the group in 1993. The group later added DJ Disk, Shortkut, DJ Flare, Yogafrog, D-Styles, and A-Trak to their lineup. They released numerous mix projects & albums and were featured in documentaries such as Battle Sounds and Scratch. The Invisibl Skratch Piklz performed their last show on July 1, 2000 at the Skratchcon 2000 conference in San Francisco, California.Individually and as a group, the Piklz's reputation in the hip-hop underground is undisputed, with journalists regularly describing how they were asked by the Disco Mix Club (DMC), an international DJ association, to stop competing since they were discouraging other DJs from even bothering to enter. But the leaps the group have made since they retired from the competition have proved most impressive - dragging turntable trickery into new and wholly autonomous territories of musicianship being developed by a new generation of bedroom virtuosi, with turntable groups such as the X-Men, the Beat Junkies, and the Skratch Piklz at the forefront. The Piklz produced most of their work around 1995\u20132000. During that period, they also gave numerous performances and seminars around the world, helped in the design of various DJ products for Vestax and Ortofon, and developed the \"break record\", an essential tool used by most present-day turntablists. One of their most notable performances was an International Turntablist Federation (ITF) battle between themselves and the X-Men (now the X-Ecutioners) of New York. Their group routine for this battle, immortalized on bootleg videos, was later recorded in a studio and released as \"The Invisibl Skratch Piklz Vs. Da Klams Uv Deth\" (see below). All previous members of the group have gone on to solo careers, most notably DJ Qbert & Mix Master Mike. Qbert, Mix Master Mike, Shortkut, and DJ Disk are featured in a live performance on the Praxis album Transmutation Live, recorded in 1997."@en ;

They disbanded in 1988, but reformed again from 2003 to 2008, issuing a new EP in 2007. The band's name is a reference to the payola scandal in the United States in the early 1960s. The group was based in Vancouver, British Columbia, and recorded mostly at Vancouver's Little Mountain Sound Studios. Through several lineup changes and name changes (the band also played as The Payola$, Paul Hyde and the Payolas and Rock and Hyde), the Payolas core members remained Paul Hyde and Bob Rock, who together wrote virtually all of the band's songs.

Although in the 1980s the Payolas always seemed poised for a big international breakthrough, the band never quite broke out despite their artistic growth and popular success in Canada. They were, however, one of the most prominent and successful platinum-selling Canadian bands of the early 1980s."@en ;

Despite their name, Beirut had never performed in Lebanon until they appeared at the Byblos International Festival in August 2014. Here is an explanation of band's name by Condon: \u201COne of the reasons I named the band after that city was the fact that it\u2019s seen a lot of conflict. It\u2019s not a political position. I worried about that from the beginning. But it was such a catchy name. I mean, if things go down that are truly horrible, I\u2019ll change it. But not now. It\u2019s still a good analogy for my music. I haven\u2019t been to Beirut, but I imagine it as this chic urban city surrounded by the ancient Christian and Muslim worlds.

	dbo:abstract	"The Doug Anthony All Stars (or Doug Anthony Allstars, DAAS, D.A.A.S. or stylised as D\u22C6A\u2020A\u262DS) are an Australian musical comedy, alternative rock and vocal group who initially performed together between 1984 and 1994. The band is an acoustic trio, originally comprising Paul McDermott and Tim Ferguson on main vocals and Richard Fidler on guitar and backing vocals. The 2014 DAAS Live reformation tour features Paul Livingston (aka Flacco) on guitar and vibes. DAAS are known for their aggressive, provocative style; their habit of involving audience members and their tendency to attack topical and sometimes controversial issues in their comedy. DAAS began performing as buskers on the streets of Canberra in 1984, while they were attending university. After winning the Pick of the Fringe award at the 1986 Adelaide Fringe Festival, the group relocated from Canberra to Melbourne, but it was not until they travelled to the Edinburgh Festival Fringe in 1987 that they first achieved success. They quickly gained popularity in the United Kingdom, where they made numerous television appearances, but remained virtually unknown in Australia until 1989 when they were made regular performers on the Australian comedy show The Big Gig. These appearances gained them recognition, and they remained a popular feature of the show until 1991 when they left to create their own ABC comedy series, DAAS Kapital. The group have released four live recordings and one studio album, DAAS Icon, which achieved some independent success in Australia but was briefly banned in Britain. They also released a collection of dark short stories in 1989, entitled Book, which took a markedly different tone from their comedic stage performances. They also made two live concert videos and one film, The Edinburgh Years. The group split up in 1994, following a final farewell tour of Australia. Although they reunited in 2003 to perform together at a benefit concert, were interviewed together in 2008 in support of their DVD, and reunited for a one-off show to launch the DAAS Kapital DVD in 2013, the three ruled out the suggestion of a reunion tour at the time. In December 2013, McDermott and Ferguson announced they would be performing \"as DAAS\" for the group's 30th anniversary, at the Canberra Comedy Festival in March 2014, with Paul Livingston performing the role of Fidler. This current line-up has announced subsequent shows in Hobart, Melbourne, Wollongong, Perth, Brisbane and Bendigo, with more dates to follow."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Angels & Airwaves is an American supergroup, currently featuring Tom DeLonge (guitarist, keyboardist and vocalist) and Ilan Rubin (drummer, keyboardist, guitarist, bassist and backing vocalist). Former members are Ryan Sinn (bassist), Adam \"Atom\" Willard (drummer), Matt Wachter (bassist). The status of David Kennedy (guitarist) and Eddie Breckenridge (bassist) is currently unknown. The band formed after Blink-182 went on hiatus in 2005. They continued to record and tour despite DeLonge reigniting his career with Blink-182 in 2009, and after DeLonge subsequently parted with Blink in 2015, he began to focus on Angels & Airwaves more extensively. The band has released five studio albums We Don't Need to Whisper (2006), I-Empire (2007), Love (2010), Love: Part Two (2011) and The Dream Walker (2014). The project also resulted in the documentary film Start the Machine (2008). In 2011, accompanying the two Love albums, the group scored and produced the science fiction drama film Love by director William Eubank in 460 theatres nationwide during their multimedia event, Love Live. The band released an animated short named Poet Anderson: The Dream Walker and their fifth album, The Dream Walker, on December 9. Other related media, such as comic books and a live-action film, are to follow in 2015. The group has been described by DeLonge as more than a band, but more accurately \"an art project [that approaches] larger human themes and tackles them in different mediums\"(sic), or simply \"a multimedia project\". This has been seen in the group's films, live events, and novel approach to fan-artist interaction. Of the first two albums, the band says that they were mainly influenced by the music of Radiohead and Pink Floyd, combining them with the grandiosity of U2. Of the first album, Delonge said that it would be \"the best music in generations\", but afterwards admitted that during this time he was addicted to painkillers."@en ;

They initially signed to Tracklacers production company New Track City and then went on to become runners-up of the fifth series of the ITV reality talent show The X Factor in 2008, coming second to Alexandra Burke.Following their appearance on The X Factor, JLS signed to Epic Records. Their first two singles \"Beat Again\" and \"Everybody in Love\" both went to number one on the UK Singles Chart. The band's self-titled debut album was released on 9 November 2009, and has since sold over 1 million copies in the UK. JLS won the awards for British Breakthrough and British Single (\"Beat Again\") at the 2010 BRIT Awards. They also won several awards at the MOBO Awards for Best song for \"Beat Again\" in 2009 and also Best Newcomer in the same year. In 2010 they won the MOBO Awards for Best UK act and Best Album. They also went on to win their fifth MOBO in 2012 by winning Best Video for \"Do You Feel What I Feel?\". They won the title of the UK's hardest-working band for two constitutive years, in 2011 and 2012. In 2010, JLS signed a record deal with the US record label Jive Records, and released \"Everybody in Love\" as their debut US single, but it failed to chart. \"The Club Is Alive\", the lead single from their second studio album, was released in the UK on July 2010, and earned the band their third number-one on the UK Singles Chart. Their single \"Love You More\", was the official single for Children in Need in 2010, and gave the group their fourth number one single in the UK. Their single \"She Makes Me Wanna\" featuring Dev was their fifth UK number one. As of 2012, their debut album and single has been named one of The X Factor's top ten biggest-selling debut singles and albums. As of 2013, they are the 16th richest reality TV stars in the UK, with an estimated fortune of \u00A36 million per member, thus giving the band a financial worth of approximately \u00A324 million. JLS have sold over 6 million records in the UK alone and more than 10 million records worldwide. The group later split up due to personal differences."@en ;

Topping the UK charts, the album won the 2005 Brit Award for Best British Album and was the second best-selling British album of 2004. Their second album, Under the Iron Sea, released in 2006, topped the UK album charts and debuting at number four on the US Billboard 200. Their third album, Perfect Symmetry, was released in October 2008. In May 2008, both Hopes and Fears (number 13) and Under the Iron Sea (number 8) were voted by readers of Q magazine as among the best British albums ever, with Keane, The Beatles, Oasis and Radiohead the only artists having two albums in the top 20. In 2009, Hopes and Fears was listed as the ninth best-selling album of the 2000s decade in the UK. Their EP, Night Train, was released in May 2010. Their fourth studio album, Strangeland, was released in May 2012, and again peaked at number one on the UK Albums Chart. Keane are known for using a piano (or a synth) as the lead instrument instead of guitars, differentiating them from most other rock bands. The inclusion of a distorted piano effect in 2006 and various synthesisers were a common feature in their music that back then combined the piano rock sound used during their first album and the more electronic sound which developed on the second and third albums. Since the start of their career, the band have sold over 10 million albums worldwide."@en ;

Former drummer Jesse Smith, singer Daniel Weyandt, and guitarists Scott Mellinger and Russ Cogdell are seen by most fans as the \"core\" of Zao. For a time, the band featured Christian themes in their music and was regarded as a Christian band, however this theme was eventually met with debate among the members and the band currently no longer considers themselves a \"Christian band\". To date, Zao has released ten full-length albums, four EPs, a two-disc DVD documentary and multiple concert tours, garnering a limited but global fanbase and earning critical praise in the process."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"MOJOFLY is a now defunct pop-rock band from the Philippines. Formed in '99 by bassist Ricci Gurango after his departure from Hungry Young Poets, MOJOFLY reeled in mainstream and alternative crowds alike with the debut album Birth Day (1999) and follow-up A Million Stories (2002), both released under Sony BMG Philippines. Then-lead singer Kitchie Nadal helped propel singles such as Another Day and Scooter Boy to national recognition. But in May 2003, Nadal left the group to embark on a solo career. Mojofly then introduced Lougee Basabas as the band\u2019s new frontwoman in only a matter of days. By year\u2019s end the group joined the \u201Cindie\u201D bandwagon with their self-titled EP, sold-out despite being available only in gigs. Because of Mata and the revived, revv-ed up Lougee-version of Minamalas, MOJOFLY (EP) showed the new sound of their group. The band went on to release an LP aptly entitled MOJOFLY Now (June, 2005), still under independent label luKas Music of artist manager and music publisher Karin Araneta. This time distributed nationwide by EMI Music Philippines, Lougee took over the reins in songwriting and gained MOJOFLY \u201Cstreet cred\u201D through her novel, cutting-edge compositions. Currently promoting MOJOFLY Now Special Edition (August, 2006), the 2-disc package marries the original \u201805 full-length and an A-VCD featuring live tracks from their first major concert at the Music Museum (September, 2005) and the 3D-animated music video of Tumatakbo. MOJOFLY is the first local artist to venture into full 3D animation in Philippine music video history. The work was previewed at the 19th Singapore International Film Festival (April, 2006) and won Best Animated Video and Favorite Indie Video at the MTV Pilipinas Video Music Awards 2006] (August, 2006). Apart from once garnering the much-coveted slot for MTV Lokal Artist-of-the-Month (March, 2005), MOJOFLY also boasts a list of celebrity endorsements from Del Monte Pizza Sauce to Penshoppe and Cream Silk Conditioners. The theme song Choose and vast multi-media exposure from the Cream Silk \u201CGirl Power, Pink Power\u201D campaign brought MOJOFLY\u2019s sound and Lougee\u2019s vivid image into every household. On 2008, Ricci Gurango, the last original member of MOJOFLY, left the band. The remaining members took in Richard Carandang and Ace Evangelista to play the bass and lead guitar. With the new members, the band decided to rename their group as Delara."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Cavalera Conspiracy is an American heavy metal band founded by Brazilian brothers Max (vocals, guitar) and Igor Cavalera (drums), currently performing along with American musicians Marc Rizzo (guitar) and Johny Chow (bass). The band originally formed in 2007 as Inflikted but changed its name for legal reasons. The group's creation marked the end of a 10-year feud between the Cavalera brothers who founded Sepultura in the early 1980s. Following the brothers' falling out, Max had formed a new band, Soulfly, and Igor had recorded four studio albums with Sepultura before leaving the band in January 2006. In July 2006, Max received an unexpected call from his brother, and by the end of the conversation, Max had invited Igor to visit him in Phoenix, Arizona, to perform in a Soulfly show. Igor joined Soulfly in concert and performed two Sepultura songs. After the show, Max suggested they begin a new project, and Igor accepted. To complete the band, Max chose Soulfly guitarist Marc Rizzo and the Gojira frontman Joe Duplantier to play bass guitar. The group then recorded their debut album at Undercity Studios in Los Angeles with engineer and co-producer Logan Mader in July 2007. Named after the band's original moniker, Inflikted was released through Roadrunner Records on 25 March 2008."@en ;

Danzer was successful as a solo artist, but also in the group Austria3, along with Wolfgang Ambros and Rainhard Fendrich. Besides his music, he translated two books from Spanish into German, and was strongly involved in highlighting social inequalities, opposing racism and any form of societal discrimination, and the lifestyle of the bourgeoisie for all his life. Danzer was romantic, funny, socially engaged - and often a misfit. Having been a strong smoker for decades, he abstained from smoking after being diagnosed with lung cancer, but nevertheless died from the disease. His legacy includes some 400 songs."@en ;

The band also performed at a number of venues across the country, supporting bands such as The Cribs and To My Boy. They cancelled their headline UK tour due to exhaustion after touring Europe supporting the band Kaiser Chiefs, and to free up time to write new material, but were due to reschedule all cancelled dates. According to an IcelandReview article from February 6, 2008, and a blog on their MySpace entitled \"Fr\u00E9ttir\" (news), dated February 5, 2008, Jakob\u00EDnar\u00EDna disbanded, with Gunnar Bergmann Ragnarsson citing that he was \"tired of band life\".

Nightwish is Finland's most successful band with more than 7 million sold albums worldwide, 1 silver award, 11 gold awards and 30 platinum awards. Although Nightwish has been prominent in their home country since the release of their first single, \u201CThe Carpenter\u201D (1997) and debut album Angels Fall First, they did not achieve worldwide fame until the release of the albums Oceanborn, Wishmaster and Century Child, which were released in 1998, 2000 and 2002 respectively. Their 2004 album, Once, which has sold more than 1.2 million copies, led to Nightwish video clips being shown on MTV in the United States and inclusion of their music in US movie soundtracks. Their biggest US hit single, \u201CWish I Had an Angel\u201D (2004), made it onto three US film soundtracks as a means to promote their North American tour. The band produced three more singles and two music videos for the album, as well as \u201CSleeping Sun\u201D, from the 2005 \u201Cbest of\u201D compilation album, Highest Hopes, prior to vocalist Tarja Turunen\u2019s dismissal. In May 2007, former Alyson Avenue frontwoman, Anette Olzon, was revealed as Turunen\u2019s replacement, and in the autumn, the band released a new album \u2013 Dark Passion Play, which has sold more than 1.5 million copies. The supporting tour started on October 6, 2007 and ended on September 19, 2009. A new E.P./live album, Made in Hong Kong (And in Various Other Places), was released in March 2009 as a MCD/DVD. Nightwish has received eleven awards from both the Emma-gaala Awards, from therteen nominations, and one Echo Awards from two nominations.

The band began in 1999 under the name Don't Look Down and changed to Much The Same in 2001 after a legal dispute with the now-defunct New Jersey band Don't Look Down. They released Quitters Never Win on A-F Records in 2003 and Survive in 2006. The band announced their break-up on April 23, 2007 following their first and only European tour. They reunited for a final farewell performance on March 26, 2011 at Reggie's Rock Club in Chicago. The sold out show featured both fan favorite songs and a few the band rarely, if ever, played live. The band announced on March 30, 2015 that they have reunited with former Break the Silence drummer, Mike Ford, on drums and will play shows around the Chicago area."@en ;

They officially assembled on June 5, 1996, when a press conference was held in Tokyo to announce the two musicians who would accompany Daisuke Asakura in his next musical venture after the breakup of Access. Between 1996 and 1999, they released six albums, a multitude of PV and live concert videos, and even a video game. Their unique and varied sound bridged genres from hard electronic rock (\"Shining Collection\"), to pop (\"Edge of the season\"), and even techno (\"Caution\"). Iceman is perhaps best known for their single \"Shining Collection\", which was used as the opening theme for Gravitation: Lyrics of Love (Asakura served as music director and composer for the series). The song became popular internationally as a result of its use in the anime, as well as in a cult flash cartoon hosted on Newgrounds, A Sticky Night of Love. The majority of the group's tracks were written by Asakura and/or Ito."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Mind over Four (occasionally written as Mind over 4) was an American heavy metal music group based out of Orange County, California. They started life as a sort of psychedelic punk band but eventually began creating their own unique brand of fierce prog/metal. In interviews they often referred to their music as \"experimetal\". BNR Metal Pages describes them as \"occupy[ing] that gray area between metal and uncommercial hard rock, but with a quirkiness in the songwriting that makes them difficult to describe or categorize\". During the course of the band, they recorded six albums and brought their electrifying live show to 14 countries and many national U.S. tours. The band dissolved shortly after the release of their 1995 album, Empty Hands. Singer Spike Xavier went on to play bass in his brother's band Humble Gods. He also played bass for the funk/metal band Mindfunk and eventually founded Corporate Avenger with Mindfunk vocalist Pat Dubar. Mike Jensen toured with KMFDM as guitar player and later joined the short lived band Overbreaker. Mike has released solo material under the name of Michael Fordays. Rich Castillo released an eclectic mix of solo material ranging from Zappa influenced comedy to smooth jazz instrumentals. Mark Fullerton worked on the production side of the film industry in Los Angeles for 15 years before moving to Utah. He now plays drums in a classic rock cover band called Mesozoic. In the fall of 2014, MO4 was rumored to be in talks of recording a new CD. In the August 21, 1993 issue of Kerrang magazine, a review of Mind Over Four's The Goddess album read: \"At their best, they're untouchable, unbelievable, perhaps the metal discovery of the '90s...utter perfection\". On the back cover photo of the Pantera album Vulgar Display of Power, Phil Anselmo can be seen wearing one of the band's T-shirts."@en ;

Young Divas released a cover of \"This Time I Know It's for Real\" to attract attention for the tour. The song peaked at number two on the ARIA Singles Chart and was certified platinum by the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA). A cover of \"Happenin' All Over Again\" was later released as their second single, which peaked at number nine and was certified gold. Due to their commercial success, Sony BMG decided that the Young Divas would record a full-length album of classic disco and pop covers titled, Young Divas, in November 2006. The album debuted at number four on the ARIA Albums Chart and was certified double platinum. In June 2007, Coulter parted ways with the group to resume her solo music career and was replaced by season four runner-up Jessica Mauboy. Young Divas released their second album New Attitude in November 2007, which debuted at number 10 on the ARIA Albums Chart and was certified gold. The album's lead single \"Turn Me Loose\" (featuring rapper Savage) reached number 15 on the ARIA Singles Chart. In 2008, Young Divas officially disbanded with all members resuming their solo music careers."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Bullet LaVolta was a post-punk band from Boston, Massachusetts, that was originally formed in January 1987 by four college disk jockeys: Clay Tarver (guitar, now of Chavez), Bill Whelan (bass), Corey \"Loog\" Brennan (guitar) and Chris \"Cruster\" Guttmacher (drums). The band later added singer Yukkie Gipe after he responded to an advertisement. They played their first show at a dive bar in Boston called Chet's Last Call to a crowd of about fifteen people, but soon became one of Boston's most popular live acts. They gained most of their notoriety by playing college shows in Boston (usually at either MIT or Harvard, with bigger acts like The Lemonheads, Dag Nasty, and the Rollins Band). The band's style of music was a kind of punk, heavy metal and hardcore punk hybrid, having reminiscences of diverse bands such as Naked Raygun, Mot\u00F6rhead and early Fugazi. The band released their self-titled EP on Taang! Records with Moving Targets guitarist Kenny Chambers joining the line-up in 1988. In 1989, they recorded and released their first full-length album, The Gift, originally released on Taang!. The band's tour manager around that time was actor Donal Logue. In 1990, they released the Gimme Danger EP (which includes a cover of Detroit Rock City) on Metal Blade before signing to RCA, who purchased and re-released Bullet Lavolta and The Gift on a single disc. The record was reviewed in People magazine and given a good rating. The album sold modestly and the band became well-known enough that their contract was renewed by RCA. A year later, they recorded and released their follow-up, Swandive, which debuted the same day as Nirvana's album Nevermind. Swandive was produced, mixed and engineered by Dave Jerden, who has also produced Jane's Addiction, Alice in Chains, Social Distortion, Fishbone and Anthrax among many others. Bullet LaVolta played a show with Nirvana around the time of the album's release, with the opening act being an unknown early incarnation of The Smashing Pumpkins. In late 1991 the band went on tour with Corrosion of Conformity and Prong in support of Swandive. The band broke up in 1992, the same year Matador Records issued an album of older recordings (mostly from 1987 and 1989) called The Gun Didn't Know I Was Loaded. As of November, 2015, none of the band's releases are in print by any label but Swandive and The Gift are available via digital download.Yukki Gipe was later the lead singer of a band called The Konks.Drummer Todd Philips drums in Model/Actress, the band formed by ex-Brainiac bass player and video director Juan Monostereo and former Chamberlain members Curtis Mead and Charlie Walker. As of December, 2014, Kenny Chambers plays with the Stone Strangers as well as maintaining a solo career."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Dramagods (formerly known as Population 1) is a rock band led by Extreme guitarist Nuno Bettencourt. The band originally started when Bettencourt released the album Population 1 in 2002 (late 2001 in Japan). On the album, he recorded all the instruments on most of the tracks. When he decided to go on tour to support the album, he formed a touring band with Joe Pessia on rhythm guitar, Steve Ferlazzo on keyboards and back-up vocals, Philip Bynoe on bass and Kevin Figueiredo on drums. Later Phil left and Joe took the role of bassist. In 2004, while still under the moniker of Population 1, they released an EP titled Sessions from Room 4. In 2005, due to legal issues, Bettencourt dropped the name Population 1 and changed it to Dramagods with the same lineup. Dramagods released their debut effort Love in December 2005, available as an import via Victor Entertainment (Japan). The band then made their record available as a digital download on iTunes in early 2006. The band toured in Japan, where they appeared at the Udo Music Festival along with KISS, Santana, Jeff Beck, The Doobie Brothers, Alice in Chains, The Pretenders, Ben Folds Five, and others in July 2006 shortly after Bettencourt took part in a three-date reunion tour with Extreme in New England. In the autumn of 2006, DramaGods contributed their song \"S'OK\" to the album project Artists for Charity - Guitarists 4 the Kids, produced by Slang Productions to assist World Vision Canada in helping underprivileged kids in need. In early 2007 Dramagods started to dissolve when Nuno, Steve and Kevin became a part of Perry Farrell's musical venture Satellite Party which released one record (Ultra Payloaded). During the subsequent tour, they ended up quitting the band by July 2007 when Nuno and Gary Cherone reformed Extreme, making it a definitive reunion. Steve Ferlazzo went on to play with Avril Lavigne."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"General Kane (known as General Caine before 1986) was an American music group fronted by Mitch McDowell (born Mitchell Leon McDowell on June 29, 1954, in San Bernardino, California; died January 22, 1992 in San Bernardino). McDowell took the professional name General Kane in tribute to an officer who had supported his artistic ambitions when he was at military school. After leaving that institution, he formed the group Booty People. They released one album for MCA Records. Mitch assembled an eight-piece funk group and signed with Groove Time Records in 1978, releasing two albums: Let Me In (1978) and Get Down Attack (1980). The group then moved to Tabu Records. General Caine's third album entitled Girls features the hit song \"For Lovers Only\". The radio station 93.1 FM WZAK in Cleveland (Ohio) penned \"For Lovers Only\" as a theme song for their late night segment with the same title. Their debut single for the Tabu label and the fourth album Dangerous with many song writing chores, were done by Johnny Guitar Carson . After a brief appearance at Capitol Records with one single released called \"Where's The Beef ?\" (a popular catch phrase at that time), a slimmed down version of the group with new writers and producers signed a recording contract with Motown Records in the mid-1980s. With a slightly new name (from General Caine to General Kane to reflect the changes in the band's lineup) and sound, they debuted for the new Motown Records label with the album In Full Chill. \"Crack Killed Applejack\" was an uncompromising reflection of drug addiction on the inner city streets and reached number 12 in the black music charts despite being barred from airplay. Subsequent releases mellowed General Kane's approach without losing their commitment to the basic rap sound of the late 80s. The group's album Wide Open did include a romantic ballad, \"Close Your Eyes\", which featured vocals from two of the group's less prominent members, Cheryl McDowell and Danny Macon. Mitch McDowell pursued a career in law enforcement as a bail bondsman after leaving the music industry. He was murdered in January 1992 along with a nephew, Akili John Davis, 18, who worked in his office. Police noted that the office safe was empty. General Kane's catalogue remained in print through the efforts of their former producer, Grover Wimberly III, who runs his own label, Groove Time Records."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"AC/DC are an Australian rock band, formed in 1973 by brothers Malcolm and Angus Young. A hard rock/blues rock band, they have also been considered a heavy metal band, although they have always dubbed their music simply \"rock and roll\". AC/DC underwent several line-up changes before releasing their first album, High Voltage, in 1975; Malcolm and Angus were the only original members left in the band. Membership subsequently stabilised until bassist Mark Evans was replaced by Cliff Williams in 1977 for the album Powerage. Within months of recording the album Highway to Hell, lead singer and co-songwriter Bon Scott died on 19 February 1980 after a night of heavy alcohol consumption. The group considered disbanding, but buoyed by support from Scott's parents, decided to continue and set about finding a new vocalist. Ex-Geordie singer Brian Johnson was auditioned and selected to replace Scott. Later that year, the band released the new album, Back in Black, which was made as a tribute to Bon Scott. The album launched them to new heights of success and became their all-time best-seller. The band's next album, For Those About to Rock We Salute You, was their first album to reach number one in the United States. Drummer Phil Rudd was fired in 1983 and replaced by ex-A II Z drummer Simon Wright, who left to join Dio in 1989. The band experienced a resurgence in the early 1990s with the release of The Razors Edge. Phil Rudd returned in 1994 after Chris Slade, who was with the band from 1989 to 1994, was asked to leave in favour of him, and contributed to the band's 1995 album Ballbreaker. Stiff Upper Lip, released in 2000, was well received by critics. The band's studio album, Black Ice, released in 2008, was the second-highest-selling album of that year, and their biggest chart hit since For Those About to Rock, eventually reaching No.1 on all charts worldwide. The band's line-up remained the same until 2014 with Malcolm Young's retirement and Rudd's legal troubles. In 2016, Johnson was advised to stop touring on account of worsening hearing loss and Guns N' Roses frontman Axl Rose stepped in as the band's vocalist for the remainder of that year's dates. Long-term bass player Cliff Williams subsequently indicated that he would retire from the band on the completion of their current world tour. AC/DC have sold more than 200 million records worldwide, including 71.5 million albums in the United States alone, adding them to the List of highest-certified music artists in the United States and the List of best-selling music artists. Back in Black has sold an estimated 50 million units worldwide, making it the fifth-highest-selling album by any artist \u2013 and the third-highest-selling album by any band. The album has sold 22 million units in the US alone, where it is the sixth-highest-selling album of all time. AC/DC ranked fourth on VH1's list of the \"100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock\" and were named the seventh \"Greatest Heavy Metal Band of All Time\" by MTV. In 2004, AC/DC ranked No. 72 on the Rolling Stone list of the \"100 Greatest Artists of All Time\". Producer Rick Rubin, who wrote an essay on the band for the Rolling Stone list, referred to AC/DC as \"the greatest rock and roll band of all time.\" In 2010, AC/DC were ranked number 23 in the VH1 list of the \"100 Greatest Artists of All Time\"."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Big Star was an American power pop band formed in Memphis, Tennessee, in 1971 by Alex Chilton, Chris Bell, Jody Stephens, and Andy Hummel. The group broke up in 1974, and reorganized with a new line-up nearly 20 years later. In its first era, the band's musical style drew on the vocal harmonies of the Beatles, as well as the swaggering rhythms of the Rolling Stones and the jangling guitars of the Byrds. To the resulting power pop, Big Star added dark, existential themes, and produced a style that foreshadowed the alternative rock of the 1980s and 1990s. Before it broke up, Big Star created a \"seminal body of work that never stopped inspiring succeeding generations\" in the words of Rolling Stone, as the \"quintessential American power pop band\" and \"one of the most mythic and influential cult acts in all of rock & roll\". Big Star's first album\u20141972's #1 Record\u2014was met by enthusiastic reviews, but ineffective marketing by Stax Records and limited distribution stunted its commercial success. Frustration took its toll on band relations: Bell left not long after the first record's commercial progress stalled, and Hummel left to finish his college education after a second album, Radio City, was completed in December 1973. Like #1 Record, Radio City received excellent reviews, but label issues again thwarted sales\u2014Columbia Records, which had assumed control of the Stax catalog, likewise effectively vetoed its distribution. After a third album was deemed non-commercially viable and shelved before receiving a title, the band broke up late in 1974. Four years later, the first two Big Star LPs were released together in the UK as a double album. The band's third album was finally issued soon afterward; titled Third/Sister Lovers, it found limited commercial success. Shortly thereafter, Chris Bell was killed in a car accident at the age of 27. The Big Star discography drew renewed attention in the 1980s when R.E.M., and the Replacements as well as other popular bands cited the group as an influence. In 1992, interest was further stimulated by Rykodisc's reissues of the band's albums, complemented by a collection of Bell's solo work. In 1993, Chilton and Stephens reformed Big Star with recruits Jon Auer and Ken Stringfellow of the Posies, and gave a concert at the University of Missouri. The band remained active, performing tours in Europe and Japan, and released a new studio album, In Space, in 2005. Chilton died on March 17, 2010, after being admitted to a New Orleans hospital with heart problems. Hummel, who was diagnosed with cancer in 2008, died on July 19, 2010. These deaths left Stephens as the sole surviving founding member. Big Star was inducted into the Memphis Music Hall of Fame in 2014."@en ;

The self-described \"rock and roll band with horns\" began as a politically charged, sometimes experimental, rock band and later moved to a predominantly softer sound, generating several hit ballads. The group had a steady stream of hits throughout the 1970s and 1980s. Second only to The Beach Boys in Billboard singles and albums chart success among American bands, Chicago is one of the longest-running and most successful rock groups, and one of the world's best-selling groups of all time, having sold more than 100 million records. According to Billboard, Chicago was the leading US singles charting group during the 1970s. They have sold over 40 million units in the US, with 23 gold, 18 platinum, and 8 multi-platinum albums. Over the course of their career they have had five number-one albums and 21 top-ten singles. They were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame on April 8, 2016 at Barclays Center in Brooklyn, New York."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Creedence Clearwater Revival, often shortened to Creedence and abbreviated as CCR, was an American rock band active in the late 1960s and early 1970s. The band consisted of lead vocalist, lead guitarist, and primary songwriter John Fogerty, his brother rhythm guitarist Tom Fogerty, bassist Stu Cook and drummer Doug Clifford. Their musical style encompassed the roots rock, swamp rock, and blues rock genres. Despite their San Francisco Bay Area origins, they portrayed a Southern rock style, with lyrics about bayous, catfish, the Mississippi River, and other popular elements of Southern United States iconography, as well as political and socially-conscious lyrics about topics including the Vietnam War. The band performed at 1969's famed Woodstock Festival. After four years of chart-topping success, the group disbanded acrimoniously in late 1972. Tom Fogerty had officially left the previous year, and his brother John was at odds with the remaining members over matters of business and artistic control, all of which resulted in subsequent lawsuits between the former band mates. Fogerty's ongoing disagreements with Saul Zaentz, owner of their label Fantasy Records, created further protracted court battles. As a result, John Fogerty refused to perform with the two other surviving former members at CCR's 1993 induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Creedence Clearwater Revival's music is still a staple of U.S. radio airplay; the band has sold 26 million albums in the United States alone. Rolling Stone ranked the band 82nd on its list of the 100 greatest artists of all time."@en ;

Formed on the third iteration of MTV's Making the Band reality television series in 2005, they were soon signed to Bad Boy Records by Diddy. Danity Kane's self-titled debut studio album was released in 2006 and achieved success in the United States, shipping a million copies domestically, while spawning two singles with top 10 single \"Show Stopper\" and the ballad \"Ride for You.\" Their second studio album, Welcome to the Dollhouse, was released in 2008, following the release of their second top 10 single \"Damaged\". The band became the first female group in Billboard history to debut their first two albums at the top of the charts. Despite initial success, tension in the group led to a meeting with Diddy where, in the October 2008 finale episode of Making the Band 4, he removed O'Day and Woodgett from the group. The three remaining members of the group carried on with previously scheduled promotional events before officially disbanding in early 2009. All group members were ultimately released from their contracts with Bad Boy Records later within the year. In 2013, four of the five group members (O'Day, Bex, Richard and Fimbres) made an official announcement regarding their reunion at the 2013 MTV Video Music Awards; however, on May 16, 2014, Fimbres announced her departure from the group due to wanting to start her family on the first night of their reunion tour in San Francisco, leaving O'Day, Bex, and Richard to continue as a trio. On August 8, 2014, after a fight in the recording studio between members O'Day and Richard, O'Day and Bex announced publicly that Danity Kane had disbanded again."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Foo Fighters is an American rock band, formed in Seattle, Washington in 1994. It was founded by Nirvana drummer Dave Grohl as a one-man project following the death of Kurt Cobain and the resulting dissolution of his previous band. The group got its name from the UFOs and various aerial phenomena that were reported by Allied aircraft pilots in World War II, which were known collectively as foo fighters. Prior to the release of Foo Fighters' 1995 debut album Foo Fighters, which featured Grohl as the only official member, Grohl recruited bassist Nate Mendel and drummer William Goldsmith, both formerly of Sunny Day Real Estate, as well as Nirvana touring guitarist Pat Smear to complete the lineup. The band began with performances in Portland, Oregon. Goldsmith quit during the recording of the group's second album, The Colour and the Shape (1997), when most of the drum parts were re-recorded by Grohl himself. Smear's departure followed soon afterward, though he would rejoin them in 2005. They were replaced by Taylor Hawkins and Franz Stahl, respectively, although Stahl was fired before the recording of the group's third album, There Is Nothing Left to Lose (1999). The band briefly continued as a trio until Chris Shiflett joined as the band's lead guitarist after the completion of There Is Nothing Left to Lose. The band released its fourth album, One by One, in 2002. The group followed that release with the two-disc In Your Honor (2005), which was split between acoustic songs and heavier material. Foo Fighters released its sixth album, Echoes, Silence, Patience & Grace, in 2007. The band's seventh studio album, Wasting Light, produced by Butch Vig was released in 2011, in which Smear returned as a full member. In November 2014, the band's eighth studio album, Sonic Highways, was released as an accompanying soundtrack to the Grohl-directed 2014 miniseries of the same name. Over the course of the band's career, four of its albums have won Grammy Awards for Best Rock Album. As of 2015, the band's eight albums have sold 12 million copies in the U.S., and 30 million worldwide."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Girls' Generation (Hangul: \uC18C\uB140\uC2DC\uB300; RR: Sonyeo Sidae), also known as SNSD, is a South Korean girl group formed by S.M. Entertainment. The group is composed of eight members: Taeyeon, Sunny, Tiffany, Hyoyeon, Yuri, Sooyoung, Yoona, and Seohyun. Originally a nine-piece group (with Jessica, who later departed from the group in September 2014), Girls' Generation debuted in 2007 with their Korean eponymous debut album. Though the album gained some attention, it was not until 2009 that the group rose to fame with the single \"Gee\", which claimed the top spot on KBS's Music Bank for a record-breaking nine consecutive weeks and was named the most popular song of the 2000s in South Korea by Melon. Girls' Generation further consolidated their popularity on the South Korean music scene with follow-up singles \"Tell Me Your Wish (Genie)\", \"Oh!\", and \"Run Devil Run\", which were released in mid-2009 and early 2010. In mid-2010, Girls' Generation signed with Nayutawave Records (present-day EMI Records Japan) to venture into the Japanese music scene. Their June 2011 self-titled Japanese debut album peaked atop the Japanese Oricon Albums Chart and became the first album by a non-Japanese girl group to be certified million by the Recording Industry Association of Japan. The group's third Korean studio album The Boys was released in October 2011 and became the best-selling album of 2011 in South Korea with sales of over 380,000 copies. An English version of the single \"The Boys\" was released by Interscope Records in an attempt to expand the group's endeavor to the global music scene. The group's 2013 fourth Korean studio album I Got a Boy was supported by the single \"I Got a Boy\", which was subjected to major attention from Western media following its winning the Video of the Year award at the inaugural YouTube Music Awards. Their fifth Korean studio album, Lion Heart, was released in 2015. Girls' Generation's signature musical styles are characterized as electropop and bubblegum pop, though their sounds have varied widely, incorporating various genres including hip hop, R&B, and EDM. They have sold over 4.4 million albums and 30 million digital singles as of 2012. The group's immense popularity in their native country South Korea has earned them numerous accolades and the titles \"The Nation's Singers\" and \"The Nation's Girl Group\". Girls' Generation is also deemed one of the prominent figures of the Korean Wave and one of the most popular K-pop acts internationally. They are the first girl group to achieve four music videos with over 100 million views on YouTube: \"Gee\", \"I Got a Boy\", \"The Boys\", and \"Mr. Taxi\". In Japan, they became the first non-Japanese girl group to have three number-one albums on the Japanese Oricon Albums Chart, and their three Japanese concert tours attracted a record-breaking 550,000 spectators, more than any other Korean girl groups."@en ;
