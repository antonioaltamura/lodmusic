	dbo:abstract	"Live at Carnegie Hall is a live Texas blues album by Stevie Ray Vaughan and Double Trouble, released on July 29, 1997 by Epic Records. The concert was recorded at New York City's Carnegie Hall on October 4, 1984, a day after Vaughan's thirtieth birthday (leading to Vaughan's description of the show as \"My best birthday ever ... forever\"), and was a benefit for the T.J. Martell Foundation. Special guests included drummer George Rains, Dr. John on keyboards, the Roomful of Blues horn section, brother Jimmie Vaughan on guitar, and vocalist Angela Strehli. This was the first and only time in the band's history that the trio was expanded. The ensemble wore custom-tailored mariachi suits and a special stage set was designed, complete with drum and horn risers. The set list was in large part Vaughan's personal, private, tribute to his models; his brother Jimmie Vaughan later recalled \"Stevie told me he was gonna play the music of his heroes, the guys who never got to play Carnegie Hall ... He didn't announce it to the audience, he didn't say anything to the people at the label. It was just something between the two of us. That's why you've got those tunes by Guitar Slim, Albert Collins, and Albert King.\" Several songs from the concert were left off the album, including a Jimi Hendrix cover of \"Voodoo Chile (Slight Return)\" and \"The Sky Is Crying\". These tracks were later released on the SRV box set in 2000. In the audience were some of Vaughan's closest friends and family. Among them were his wife at the time, Lenny Bailey, and his parents, who were flown to New York City from Texas. John Hammond, who signed the band to Epic Records, was at the show to introduce Vaughan as \"one of the great guitar players of all time\"."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Love Me or Leave Me is a Doris Day album based on the soundtrack of the film of the same name. It was released monaurally by Columbia Records as catalog number CL-710 on May 2, 1955, in both LP as well as 45-EP formats and became her best-selling album to date, spending 28 weeks on the Billboard magazine album chart and reaching the #1 position. The best-selling album of Day's career, it ranks #16 of all albums produced between 1955 and 1996. For the 1963 re-release of the picture and subsequent re-release of the record, instead of going back to the actual soundtrack recordings recorded in Hollywood specifically for the film and remixing for Stereo, producers merely took the original monaural New York session tapes and electronically synthesized a stereo signal. Thirty years later, producers finally went back to the original pre-recorded and post-recorded music stems and remixed for true stereo from sources that will lock to picture. In the opening track, the vocal starts out in one channel exclusively and then rapidly pans to the center where it remains throughout the rest of the stereo material on the album, which includes as a bonus, several of the original monaural New York session masters featuring different arrangements. Like most so-called \"soundtrack\" albums of the period, the tracks featured hereon are in most cases not the exact performances recorded for the film, and which lock to picture. In this type of scenario, often arrangements will differ from the slight to the great compared to the film performance, and the key and/or tempo may be adjusted up or down accordingly as well for a greater impact on records. Even though the audio portion of a great many film performances would have been recorded at Hollywood-based sessions as the technical requirements were many, the companion performances intended for release on records is often recorded in New York, where the best studios for records are often found and for which the technical requirements are considerably fewer than for film."@en ;

Memorial was produced by Brandon Curtis (Secret Machines, Interpol), who also produced the band's two previous albums, Empros (2011) and Geneva (2009). Bassist Brian Cook said that Memorial is more \"polarizing\" between heavy and soft parts than previous efforts, and that the \"heavy parts are much more blown out and exaggerated while the pretty moments are far more restrained, delicate, and atmospheric.\" Cook also described the album as being darker and more somber than previous efforts. Inspired by Pink Floyd's 1977 album Animals, Memorial's album structure features the similarly composed intro/outro songs \"Memoriam\" and \"Memorial\" to make the album start and end in the same place. Prior to the release of Memorial, Russian Circles released online streams of \"Deficit\" in August 2013, \"Memorial\" in September 2013 and \"1777\" in October 2013 to promote the album.

The album's lyrics were written exclusively by Hamasaki, who also composed two songs with Dai Nagao. The other songs on the album were composed by Bounceback and Tetsuya Yukumi. Memorial Address was Hamasaki's first album to be released as a CD+DVD package, a marketing strategy her label would often employ throughout her career. Three singles were released from Memorial Address. Lead single \"&\" was released July 9, 2003. A triple A-side single including \"Ourselves\", \"Greatful Days\", and \"Hanabi Episode II\", it became her fifteenth number-one single in Japan, though it would become her last single to date to sell over 500,000 copies. Second single \"Forgiveness\" was released that August and also reached number one, but only sold 220,000 copies, disappointing by her standards at the time. The third and final single, \"No Way to Say\", also reached number one and sold over 371,000 copies. Though more successful than \"Forgiveness\", it marked the beginning of a commercial decline for Hamasaki. Memorial Address experienced immense commercial success, becoming her seventh consecutive number-one record in Japan, with first-week sales of 524,000 copies. It is the best-selling mini-album by a Japanese female, with sales of over 1 million copies in its initial 53-week chart run. All of the songs featured on the CD tracklist (with the exception of \"Memorial Address\", the title track) had a corresponding music video.

	dbo:abstract	"Minutes to Midnight is the third studio album by American rock band Linkin Park, released on May 14, 2007, through Warner Bros. Records. The album was produced by Mike Shinoda and Rick Rubin. Minutes to Midnight was the band's follow-up album to Meteora (2003) and features a shift in the group's musical direction. For the band, the album marks a beginning of deviation from their signature nu metal sound. Minutes to Midnight takes its title from the Doomsday Clock. Linkin Park started work on their third studio album in 2003, taking a break to tour in support of Meteora in 2004. In this time period, the band formed numerous side projects; Mike Shinoda formed his hip hop side project Fort Minor, while Chester Bennington formed Dead by Sunrise, causing the album to be shelved temporarily. The band returned to work on the record afterward, taking on a different musical direction than the 2003 sessions while working with producer Rick Rubin. The album's completion was delayed several times for unknown reasons. Eventually, \"What I've Done\" was chosen as the album's lead single in April 2007, with the album seeing release in North America on May 15, 2007. The album debuted at number one in the U.S. Billboard 200 and in 15 other countries, including the United Kingdom and Canada. In the United States, the album had the biggest first week sales of 2007 at the time, with 623,000 albums sold, going on to be certified triple platinum in the United States. It was also certified double platinum in New Zealand, Italy, Ireland, and Australia and certified platinum in Canada, France, Switzerland and in the UK. Despite its commercial success, Minutes to Midnight received mixed reviews from critics. Rolling Stone magazine named it the twenty-fifth best album of 2007. It has sold more than 18 million copies worldwide, 3 millions of which were sold in the USA. It was ranked number 154 on Billboard's Hot 200 Albums of the Decade."@en ;

The album peaked on the Billboard 200 at #132. Moods consisted of 10 tracks, ranging from sultry ballads to bouncy pop tunes.

The album comprises ten previously released tracks (three of which are in a remixed form), and three new recordings: \"Wake Up\", \"Beat of My Heart\", and \"Break My Heart\". A deluxe edition of the album, subtitled The Collector's Signature Edition, was also released, containing additional remixes and another new recording \"Supergirl\". At first, Duff was concerned about the reaction of fans to the new songs, since they carry a \"totally different sound\" and are more dance-oriented than her previous music. Following its release, Most Wanted received mostly negative reviews from critics, who deemed the release as premature, stating that Duff did not have enough material to warrant a compilation. However, the Dead Executives-produced tracks received favorable comments; critics wrote that they stood out from the rest of the album. In the United States, the album debuted atop the Billboard 200 chart, becoming Duff's second number one album there. It was later certified Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). Elsewhere, it debuted at number one in Canada, and reached the top ten in Australia, Ireland, Italy, Japan and New Zealand. Four singles were released from the album. The lead single, \"Wake Up\", was released in August 2005, and peaked within the top ten in countries including Italy, Norway and the United Kingdom. In the United States, the song reached number 29 and was certified Gold by the RIAA. The accompanying music video features Duff portraying styles from cities over the world like London and Tokyo. The second single, \"Beat of My Heart\", peaked in the top 20 in countries such as Australia, Italy and Spain. \"Supergirl\" was released in February 2006 exclusively to the iTunes Store as the album's third single and \"Fly\", originally released as the lead single from Hilary Duff, was released throughout Europe as the fourth and final single from Most Wanted.

The album is musically eclectic, varying from Middle Eastern violin\u2013reggae beat fusion \"This House Is on Fire\" to 10,000 Maniacs-sounding \"Tell Yourself\". Folky \"Motherland\" precedes stylistically Merchant's next album, The House Carpenter's Daughter. Originally, \"The End\" was supposed to appear on the album instead of \"Not In This Life.\" Merchant noted that: I'd take out one song, 'Not in This Life,' she said, referring to a midtempo meditation on love, because it seems frivolous to me now. And I'd put back a song called 'The End,' which probably would have gotten me in trouble. Part of the lyric goes: 'That'll be the end of war/ the end of the law of Bible, of Koran, Torah.' I really wanted to put it on the record, but I felt there was so much serious material already that I chose something lighter, for balance. The album is dedicated to the victims of September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks upon the United States. However, the recording was finished two days before the event, so the songs are not influenced by it. The event has still affected people's interpretations of the lyrics. Additionally, the cover was changed at the last minute to accommodate the post-9/11 world.Her original concept for the photograph on the album cover was a picture of children in a field wearing oxygen masks. We shot these kids in upstate New York on Sept 10, she recalled. And then we were going to reshoot on the 11th. Of course we canceled the session. The day I brought the pictures into the city, there were articles on the run here for Cipro and gas masks. I was getting pressure, anyway, from the record label, friends even, that the image was too controversial. So finally I gave in. A photograph of a demure-looking Ms. Merchant was used instead. The title song was later covered by Joan Baez and Christy Moore."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Nina is the self-titled third studio album by Filipino singer Nina, released in the Philippines on August 23, 2006 by Warner Music. After the success of her cover album Nina Live!, Nina decided to release an all-original studio album as a follow-up. She named the album after herself and stated that she considers it to be \"self-titled,\" because she believes it showcases her true self as an artist. The album recaptures the sound of her first two albums, but only bigger and broader in terms of genre. It consists mostly of \"toned-down\" songs that were sung in a \"soft, near-whispery volume.\" The project marked the first time that she worked with Jim Baluyut as the new executive of the label. The production also featured international songwriters Walter Afanasieff, Matthew Gerrard and Harvey Mason, Jr. The idea of recording an all-original album came up when Nyoy Volante wrote two ballad love songs for Nina. She called the songs \"beautiful and inspiring,\" that she ended up recording an album of original songs. She also described Volante to be \"very instrumental\" in the direction they took for the album. Another reason on why the label departed from the Nina Live! concept is that they did not feel it is right to give the fans two cover albums in a row. Instead, they did the opposite\u2014an all-original studio album which showcases Nina's more delicate, \"chill-out\" sound\u2014leaving a part of her diva persona behind. The album was originally scheduled to be released in the summer of 2006, but was moved due to conflict with her scheduled concerts in the United States. Upon release, Nina received the most positive reviews and the highest critical ratings among Nina albums, with Titik Pilipino calling her \"more refined, polished.\" On January 30, 2007, the album was made available on digital download through iTunes and Amazon.com MP3 Download. It did not equal the commercial success of Nina Live!, but it managed to reach Gold status by the Philippine Association of the Record Industry (PARI) in 2006. In 2007, the album was certified Platinum and earned awards from different organizations. Due to the album's critical and commercial success, Warner decided to re-release it in a special limited edition, featuring the hits of Barry Manilow. The re-release earned three singles, on which the two became commercial hits. Four singles were released from the album. \"Araw Mo\", a birthday song that was used for the promotion of Goldilocks' 40 Thoughtful Years Anniversary, was included in the album as a bonus track. The first official single, \"I Do\", was released along with the album and it managed to pick up substantial airplay. It didn't equal the success of Nina's previous singles, however. \"Someday\" was released as the album's second single. The song later achieved international success, being covered by popular Southeast Asian artists. \"I Can't Make You Love Me\", a Bonnie Raitt original, was the last commercial single which quickly became a radio favorite, topping radio charts in the country. \"Love Is Contagious\", a Taja Sevelle original, is the other cover in the album and later, received limited rotation on radio."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"No Frills is the sixth studio album by American singer Bette Midler, released on Atlantic Records in 1983. No Frills was Midler's first studio album in four years, following the movies The Rose, Divine Madness! and the ill-fated Jinxed!. The rock and new wave influenced album was produced by Chuck Plotkin, best known for his work with Bob Dylan and Bruce Springsteen, and included three single releases; the ballad \"All I Need to Know\", a cover of Marshall Crenshaw's \"My Favourite Waste of Time\" and Midler's take on the Rolling Stones classic \"Beast of Burden\". While No Frills surprisingly became Midler's second lowest-charting album in the US, peaking at #60 on Billboard (her 1979 disco album Thighs and Whispers #65), it became her best-selling studio album to date in both Continental Europe and Scandinavia; in West Germany it reached #15, in the Netherlands #10, in Norway #2 and in Sweden No Frills managed to reach the top spot of the albums chart, even outselling the Rose soundtrack and the \"Beast of Burden\" single was indeed a Top 10 hit in most parts of Europe. The promo video for the song, made during the early MTV era, featured Mick Jagger in a cameo role playing Midler's boyfriend. The soundtrack to the video including the spoken dialogue (with Midler famously telling Jagger \"Just stay long enough to hear me sing your song. I sing it better than anybody.\" Jagger replies: \"Well almost anybody....\") was released on the B-side of the 12\" single in Europe. In September 1984 the video for \"Beast Of Burden\" was nominated for three MTV Video Music Awards for Best Female Video, Best Choreography, and Best Stage Performance Video. Midler recorded several songs for the album that did not make the final cut. Among these were Bruce Springsteen's \"Pink Cadillac\" (later covered by Natalie Cole) \"Broken Bicycles\", the Jonathan King-written \"Everyone's Gone To The Moon,\" and Peter Gabriel's \"Here Comes The Flood\" -- all of which she had performed live on her 1982-1983 concert tour De Tour, later released on VHS/DVD as Art or Bust. The ballad \"All I I Need To Know\", composed by renowned songwriting team Barry Mann, Cynthia Weil and Tom Snow, which had peaked at #77/39 on the US Singles and A/C charts with Midler in late 1983, was some five years later covered by Linda Ronstadt on her album Cry Like a Rainstorm, Howl Like the Wind. Ronstadt's Grammy winning version of the song was recorded as a duet with Aaron Neville and retitled \"Don't Know Much\" and then became a #2 hit on the US singles chart and #1 on the Adult Contemporary chart and a worldwide hit single. \"My Favourite Waste of Time\" was in turn covered by Scottish singer Owen Paul in 1986 and was a Top 5 hit in the UK. When Midler's greatest hits compilation Experience the Divine was released in 1993 only one song from No Frills was included; \"Only In Miami\" - an album track which never was a single either in the US or in Europe. A second edition of the compilation with a revised track list, released in 1996, however added both \"Beast of Burden\" and \"My Favourite Waste of Time\". The album was released on CD for the first time in 1990. A remastered version of the album was released by Atlantic Records/Warner Music in 1995."@en ;

The album was released in 1991. \"Backlash\" was the label's first choice for a single, but the resulting one-track CD was only available as a promotional item sent to DJs. \"Don't Surrender\" was released in the US as a CD single accompanied by a remix (\"The Most Excellent Mix\") and the non-LP track \"Misunderstood\". \"Wait for Me\", a song Jett wrote when she was just 16, was a cover of The Runaways' version from their 1977 album Waitin' for the Night. \"I Want You\" was a revised version of a song from 1979 that Jett and Kenny Laguna had written for a movie she was set to star in. The original lyrics (which can be heard on the fan-club only CD 1979) were nihilistic and raw, whereas the version heard on Notorious is politically correct. Several editions of the album feature \"Machismo\" before \"Goodbye\", but this is the only difference. \"I Want You\", as well as other songs by Joan Jett and the Blackhearts, was featured in Floria Sigismondi's 2010 biopic film The Runaways, but they were not included on the soundtrack album of the film."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Piece by Piece is the second studio album by British-Georgian jazz and blues singer Katie Melua. It was released on 26 September 2005 by Dramatico Records. In the United Kingdom, the album debuted at #1 with 120,459 copies sold in its first week. Its first single, \"Nine Million Bicycles\", became Melua's first top five hit in the UK and caused controversy when science writer Simon Singh said the lyrics \"demonstrates a deep ignorance of cosmology and no understanding of the scientific method\". After an amusing and good-natured debate in the Press Melua eventually recorded Singh's version, which both agreed was scientifically accurate and musically pathetic. The second single was a double A-side comprising \"I Cried for You\" and a cover of The Cure's \"Just Like Heaven\". The former song was written after Melua met the writer of The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail and is about Jesus and Mary Magdalene, while the latter was recorded for the soundtrack to the film Just Like Heaven. The single peaked outside the UK top twenty, and the album's third single, \"Spider's Web\" (which Melua wrote when she was eighteen, during the Iraq war) did not reach the top forty. Melua wrote the title song \"Piece By Piece\" after she broke up with her boyfriend Luke Pritchard, and \"Half Way up the Hindu Kush\" was written by Katie and Mike Batt as a joke playing on the innuendo implicit in the title phrase, which cropped up in a conversation about scarves on a train journey. Katie wrote the chorus and Mike the verses. Alongside covers of \"Blues in the Night\" and Canned Heat's \"On the Road Again\", the album includes \"Thankyou, Stars\", which was previously released as a B-side on Melua's debut single \"The Closest Thing To Crazy\" in 2003.

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Piece_by_Piece_(Kelly_Clarkson_album)>	rdf:type	schema:MusicAlbum ;
	dbo:abstract	"Piece by Piece is the seventh studio album by American recording artist Kelly Clarkson. It was released on February 27, 2015, through RCA Records. The follow-up to her first Christmas album, Wrapped in Red (2013), it is her first studio album to completely contain original material since Stronger (2011), and her final studio album under her recording contract after winning the first season of the television singing competition series American Idol in 2002. Piece by Piece sees Clarkson reuniting with frequent collaborators Greg Kurstin, Jesse Shatkin, Jason Halbert, Eric Olson, and Chris DeStefano. Her pregnancy hurdled her efforts to write more than five songs for the album. As such, she gathered material from songwriters such as Sia, Matthew Koma, MoZella, Bonnie McKee, David Jost, Semi Precious Weapons lead singer Justin Tranter, and former Cobra Starship member Ryland Blackinton, among others. Inspired by the orchestral production on Wrapped in Red, Clarkson wanted for all the songs on Piece by Piece to resonate like its own film soundtrack, taking a cue from the soundtracks of the feature motion pictures Cruel Intentions (1999) and Love Actually (2003) and commissioning orchestral arrangements by Joseph Trapanese. The album is illustrated as a concept record telling a single story, using themes of heartbreak, personal struggles, peace, and empowerment. The music of Piece by Piece consists of electropop, orchestral pop, power pop and electronic dance music, marking a departure from the predominant pop rock sound of her previous studio albums. It also features guest vocals by John Legend. Piece by Piece was released to positive reception by music critics, who applauded Clarkson's vocal performances. Criticism mainly targeted the album's production, as well as its belaboring on midtempo arrangements. Commercially, it became her third album to debut at the top of the Billboard 200 chart with 97,000 units sold. The album was preceded by the release of its lead single \"Heartbeat Song\" in January 2015, which became a top 30 hit on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. The record's second single, \"Invincible\" was released in May 2015, while its supporting tour, the Piece by Piece Tour, began on July 11, 2015. On December 7, 2015, Piece by Piece received a nomination for the Grammy Award for Best Pop Vocal Album at the 58th Annual Grammy Awards. Being her fourth nomination in the category, Clarkson broke her previous record of the most nominations in which she once shared with Madonna, P!nk, Sarah McLachlan and Justin Timberlake. The albums lead single, \"Heartbeat Song\", also received a nomination for the Grammy Award for Best Pop Solo Performance. On March 4, 2016, RCA will release Piece by Piece Remixed which contains remixed versions of ten of the tracks from the album."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Pure is the first internationally published album by Christchurch, New Zealand soprano Hayley Westenra. Her previous albums were released only in New Zealand and nearby Australia. This album also received professional consultation from the legendary Sir George Martin who helped to create its \"unique appeal\". In 2004, it was the highest selling New Zealand Album and so it privileged Hayley with an award from the New Zealand Music Awards of 2004. It was published by the Decca Music Group label in 2003. It was distributed in the United States by Universal Classics in 2004. During its first week of sales it sold 19,068 copies. As of 2007, Pure is the best selling classical album for the 21st century in the UK. Pure gives a new freshness to well known classical repertoire, as well as exploring the world of pop and traditional Maori choral singing, including renditions of \"Who Painted the Moon Black?\", \"Hine e Hine\" (a song of the M\u0101ori, the natives of New Zealand), \"In Trutina\", from Orff's Carmina Burana, \"Wuthering Heights\" (a cover of the Kate Bush hit), and the perennial spiritual classic \"Amazing Grace\". Sir George Martin co-wrote the track \"Beat of Your Heart\" just for the album. Also on the album is \"Pokarekare Ana\", a New Zealand love song which has enduring popularity, and has become Hayley's signature song. Pure was recorded at Air Lyndhurst, Eastcote Studios, London, England."@en ;

The album received a generally positive reception from critics. Reign of Terror debuted at number 12 on the Billboard 200 and spawned only one single: \"Comeback Kid\". To promote the album, Sleigh Bells toured across North America and Europe."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Revolver (stylized as rEVOLVEr) is the fourth studio album by Swedish metal band The Haunted. After having been absent for the last two studio albums, Peter Dolving was once again back in the band and provided the vocals for rEVOLVEr. He would remain with the band until he left once again in 2012. As the album title attempts to make clear with its stylization (i.e. with the word \"EVOLVE\" printed in upper case letters between the two r's), the band made a conscious decision to slightly tweak ( or \"evolve\") its songwriting on this particular album. As a result, rEVOLVEr contains some elements that were hitherto absent on previous The Haunted albums. Although the album still contains examples of the band's familiar thrash metal sound (e.g. No Compromise, Sabotage, Sweet Relief), it features considerably more mid-paced riffing (e.g. 99, Burnt to a Shell, Fire Alive) than in any of their previous albums. Two of the tracks even have ballad elements interspersed in them (Abysmal and My Shadow).Also notable is that rEVOLVEr has quite a few instances of clean singing in it, although the vast majority of the vocal tracking was still done in The Haunted's traditional hardcore/metalcore style of screaming. A limited edition digipak of this CD contained two bonus tracks, and different artwork. A music video was made for \"No Compromise\" which featured Mark Greenway."@en ;

Rundgren himself wrote, produced and sang every tune on The Ballad of Todd Rundgren, as well as handling all guitars, keyboards, and vocals. \"I was pretty overbearing to deal with,\" Rundgren recalled in the liner notes to the 1999 CD release. \"I was also becoming very particular about arrangements, so I took a crack at playing it all myself. But I still had some dependence on other musicians. I wasn't yet ready to play drums or to seriously address what bass playing should be like.\" Tony Sales, who played bass on Runt, the previous album, plays on the majority of tracks, but brother Hunt Sales, the drummer on the first album, plays drums only on one cut and conga on one. Studio musicians Jerry Scheff and John Guerin provide the rhythm section on two tracks; Norman D. Smart, who later became a member of the Hello People and was Mountain's first drummer, plays on the remainder. The album cover was designed by Milton Glaser. In mid 1971, Bearsville was purchased by Warner Bros. and plans were made to re-release both Runt and Runt. The Ballad of Todd Rundgren as a \"twin pack\" entitled Todd Rundgren's Rack Job (Catalog Number 2BV 2156) in 1973. The album got as far as test presses and album art, but was shelved as Rundgren preferred to release an album of new material."@en ;

The album features two new rappers, Akil Dasan and Gaston, both of whom Geoff found at New York City's Nuyorican Poets Caf\u00E9. While Akil's prominent features exhibit a quick and crisp delivery, Gaston has more of an old school approach. The live band consists of Chris Storr (trumpet), Ed Jones (saxophone), Neville Malcolm (double bass), Ernie Cranenburgh (jazz guitar), pianists Mike Gorman, Sean Hargreaves and John Crawford, as well as turntablist DJ First Rate.

	dbo:abstract	"Seili is the second studio album by Finnish pop singer Jenni Vartiainen. It was released by Warner Music Finland digitally on 31 March 2010, with the official physical release following on 14 April. From 31 March to the official physical release date, the album was sold at \u20AC19 in conjunction with Ilta-Sanomat. The album was re-released on 14 January 2011, in a limited vinyl edition. The Finnish-language album, incorporating electro and synthpop elements along with melancholic piano ballads, is named after the island Seili (Sj\u00E4l\u00F6 in Swedish), located off the south-west coast of Finland. The album was produced and co-written by Jukka Immonen with Vartiainen writing also two of the songs. The main lyricists were Teemu Brunila and Mariska who contributed to the thematical dualism of the album\u2014Brunila wrote the happier songs about publicity and finding love while Mariska wrote the lyrics for the songs that deal with darker and more serious themes, such as death. Another lyricist was Paula Vesala (from the pop rock duo PMMP). Vartiainen participated more in the production than with her debut album Ihmisten edess\u00E4, by playing for example piano and kantele. Critically acclaimed for its vocals and successful combination of ballads and pop, though criticized for lack of peculiarity and a somewhat inconsistent song selection, Seili spent 62 non-consecutive weeks on the Finnish Albums Chart since its release\u2014with 15 weeks atop the chart\u2014and sold over 95,000 copies in 2010, becoming the best-selling album of 2010 in Finland. Altogether, Seili has sold over 150,000 copies since its release and currently ranks 14th in the list of the best-selling albums of all time in Finland. The album received three Emma Awards in February 2011: for Album of the Year, Pop/Rock Album of the Year and Best-Selling Album of the Year. The album included also two Emma-winning songs, the gold-selling singles \"En haluu kuolla t\u00E4n\u00E4 y\u00F6n\u00E4\" and \"Miss\u00E4 muruseni on\", winning in the categories Song of the Year and Music Video of the Year, respectively. \"Nettiin\" was released as the third single and the album spawned two promotional singles, \"Duran Duran\", which sold also gold, and \"Eik\u00F6 kukaan voi meit\u00E4 pelastaa?\". \"Miss\u00E4 muruseni on\" was the major chart hit, dominating the top-three spots of the Finnish Singles Chart from August 2010 to January 2011 and becoming the third-best-selling single of 2011 in Finland. To promote the album, Vartiainen embarked on a concert tour titled Seili, spanning from April 2010 to August 2011 and consisting of 170 shows."@en ;

Shiver debuted inside the top twenty on the Australian ARIA Albums Chart and was certified double platinum by ARIA. It yielded five singles: \"Saved Me\", \"She Has to Be Loved\", \"Aotearoa\", \"Street of Love\" and \"Self Deceiver\". Shiver was commercially successful in Australia.

The album spent a total of forty-one weeks in the top fifty, and fifty-seven weeks in the top one-hundred. The Australian Recording Industry Association awarded the album double platinum certification for shipping 140,000 copies and became the thirtiest highest selling album in Australia for 1989. It sold around 250,000 copies in Australia. Jonathan Lewis of AllMusic states that the album was not a huge leap from her previous album and this album shows that she is maturing as a songwriter.

It was released through Diwphalanx Records in early 2008 (late 2008 for the live version accordingly), featuring guest musicians Michio Kurihara of Ghost and Stephen O'Malley of Sunn O))), both of whom have collaborated with Boris in the past. Shortly after this initial release, the album was released by American label Southern Lord with a slightly different track listing, different artwork (by Stephen O'Malley), and an almost entirely different sound. The first 3000 copies of this edition include a DVD containing videos for \"Statement\", \"Pink\" and \"My Neighbor Satan\". Notably, this release is the second Boris album to feature vocals on every track (the first, excluding any one-track albums, was Amplifier Worship). Also, it delves more into experimental tendencies with a more manipulated sound, use of drum machines, and even experiments with sampled tracks (notably, \"Dead Destination\" is essentially \"No Ones Grieve part 2\" from The Thing Which Solomon Overlooked 2 with added vocals; part of the seventh song from Vein is used in the untitled final track). The album can also be seen as humorous since Boris have referenced this album in an interview with Terrorizer Magazine as \"un-cool\" and \"The sell-out album\" with comical lyricism (A prime example being the song \"Buzz-In\" which is about the Melvins live video Salad of a Thousand Delights), an 80s look for the band themselves, and the tones of voice in some of the songs. The album charted on the Billboard Top Heatseekers chart at number 20."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Smile is the second studio album by Filipino singer Nina, released in the Philippines on December 12, 2003 by Warner Music. The album was a follow-up to the tremendous success of her debut album. It resembles the same sound from its predecessor, but only bigger and bolder in terms of incorporating urban-style to upbeat rhythmic jams and harmonic sound to powerful sentimental ballads. Ricky Ilacad, head of Warner label, assigned a few international songwriters and arrangers, including J\u00F6rgen Elofsson and Rudy P\u00E9rez, to collaborate with the label on the production of the album, which is noticeably broader compared to the first project. For the first time, Nina wrote a song, \"Can't Say I Love You\", which made it to the final cut. The album contains three cover versions of songs by Madonna, Baron Barbers and Cris Villonco. Upon release, the album received generally favorable reviews from music critics, many of which pointed out the similarities of its sound to Nina's debut, but criticized the lack of appeal and new sound and failure to produce potential hits. It is also described as her most Mariah Carey-influenced album at that time. In 2004, it was certified gold by the Philippine Association of the Record Industry (PARI). On June 21, 2005, it was made available on digital download through iTunes and Amazon.com MP3 Download. In 2009, the song \"What If\" was covered by Korean boyband Super Junior for their album Sorry, Sorry. To date, the album has sold more than 30,000 units in the Philippines, certifying Platinum by the PARI. Three successful commercial singles were released from the album. \"Make You Mine\", the lead single, became Nina\u2019s third number one single in the country, allowing her to be the first and only female OPM artist to have three number one singles in a span of one year. \"A Girl Can Dream\" was released as the second single and it performed well on Philippine charts. It did not reach number one, however, but she managed to popularize the song and make it her own, even if it was originally recorded by another artist. \"Sayang Naman\" is the first Tagalog single by Nina and the last commercial single from the album. It was released due to high demand and requests by fans and listeners. Despite this, the song did not perform on charts as well as her previous releases."@en ;

Gorman pointed out that the band would probably be better served by a traditional keyboardist. Gorman was replaced by Phil Aiken after Janovitz spied his classified ad in a local weekly.

It contains hard rock songs such as \"Welcome To The Club\" and a remake of the Barnstorm track, \"Turn To Stone\". It also contains more introspective material such as \"Help Me Through the Night\" and \"Song For Emma\", a tribute to Walsh's daughter who had been killed in a car accident the previous year. On a few tracks, Don Henley, Glenn Frey, and Randy Meisner of the Eagles contributed backing vocals. Over a year and a half later, Walsh would be drafted into the Eagles to replace founding member Bernie Leadon, playing on their best-selling studio album Hotel California. The album was re-issued five years later by MCA Records in 1979."@en ;

Metheny jokingly refers to the piece as \"The Publix Song\" when performing in Florida, as the commercial aired every holiday season from 1987 to 1996. The NPR radio show \"Radio Deluxe with John Pizzarelli\" uses the tune as its closing theme. In 2015, the song served as the end theme of the anime adaptation JoJo's Bizarre Adventure during the second half of the show's Stardust Crusaders arc, and was subsequently became the focus of Essential Collection Last Train Home, a JoJo-themed compilation album for Pat Metheny Group. The composition has also been featured during The Weather Channel's \"Local on the 8s\" playlist since roughly the late 1980s. \"(It's Just) Talk\" has also been featured on the local forecasts on The Weather Channel since about the same time.[citation needed]"@en ;

It features Hancock's vocals through a vocoder as well as performances by drummer Tony Williams and bassist Jaco Pastorius. This was when Hancock began heading towards a more mainstream Smooth Jazz/R&B fusion, similar to fellow Jazz-Fusion pianist Patrice Rushen. This would last until his 1982 album Lite Me Up. The album produced a single entitled \"I Thought It Was You\" which was mildly received at the time by UK jazz listeners. As a whole the album tends to lay more toward funk than a jazz record, and is reminiscent of much of the electro-funk of the time. This release marks the beginning of the 1980s electro-era style that was more refined in Herbie's later albums such as Future Shock and Sound-System."@en ;

The session guitarist Tore Moren plays guitar solo on \"Nihilism 2002\" and the first solo on \"Psychopath\". Samuel Durling of the death industrial band Mental Destruction performs distorted vocals on \"Emancipation\". The album was recorded at Top Room Studios. It was produced by B\u00F8rge Finstad and was mixed at Fagerborg Studios and Top Room Studios. Morten Lund mastered the album at Masterhuset AS. The album cover was painted by Hugh Syme, who has done work for such groups as Iron Maiden, Megadeth, Rush and Fates Warning. The band says that the cover picture \"illustrates the synergy effect of elements working together (monk and Death) and thus gaining strength beyond what the effect would be if all the elements would be working separately.\" Stephanie Sollow of Progressive World gave the album a very positive review, writing: \"Extol are very good at what they do, playing a very tight and intricately arranged form of progressive thrash metal, if you will. They transition easily between different meters, all while creating a heavy wall of sound though which a guitar lead or some dynamic cymbal work will poke through for its lead spot.\""@en ;

The US version of the album had a track list slightly different from that of the UK version: the US version removed \"I'm the Urban Spaceman\" and added \"Readymades\" the B-side of their follow-up single \"Mr. Apollo\". The UK version was reissued on vinyl by Sunset Records in the early 1970s, re-titled \"I'm the Urban Spaceman\". In 2007 the album was reissued on CD with its original title and artwork, by EMI with five bonus tracks."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"The Boy with the Arab Strap is the third studio album by Scottish indie pop band Belle & Sebastian. The inspiration for the album's name came from the band Arab Strap, who are also from Scotland and briefly toured with Belle & Sebastian. An Arab strap is a sexual device for retaining an erection, a fact unknown to Stuart Murdoch at the time. Arab Strap were reportedly less than pleased with their inclusion in the title of the album. When questioned about it, Arab Strap's leader/singer, Aidan Moffat, said \"They have a sense of humor.\" Malcolm Middleton, the band's instrumentalist, added, \"Because Arab Strap is quite an interesting name. The words go well together. That's why we chose it as a band name. We're friends with them, but there's a limit to putting someone else's name on an album. They\u2019re taking away something from us.\" He also mentioned that the album had been confused as a collaboration between the bands. The album features several lead vocals by members of the band other than Murdoch. Stevie Jackson sings lead on both \"Seymour Stein\" and \"Chickfactor\", Stuart David gives a spoken word performance on \"A Space Boy Dream\" and Isobel Campbell sings lead on \"Is It Wicked Not to Care?\". In October 2011, NME placed the title track at number 130 on its list \"150 Best Tracks of the Past 15 Years\"."@en ;

Commissioned and released by Dr. Strange Records (rather than Skankin' Pickle's own label Dill Records), The Green Album was originally intended to be a six-song EP of cover songs wherein each member picked and sung a song of their choosing. Eventually the decision was made to expand the EP into a full-length, leading the band to record seven additional songs, all of which were unreleased demos dating back to as far as 1989. According to the liner notes, The Green Album was recorded and mixed in 30 hours for the cost of $735, recorded on 8 track in the basement where trombonist Lars Nylander and members of ska punk band The Rudiments were living at the time. Founder and vocalist Mike Park announced his departure from Skankin' Pickle in the liner notes of The Green Album, writing \"The band has been such a big part of my life but I feel it is time to move on!\". Skankin' Pickle continued touring following the release of The Green Album with Janitors Against Apartheid saxophonist Mike Liu in Park's place, though would ultimately go through multiple line-up changes until only Nylander and guitarist Lynette Knackstedt remained from the recorded line-up by late 1996, after which the group was rebranded as The 78 RPMs."@en ;

The reunion of the group first appeared as 213 in Warren G's The Return of the Regulator in the track \"Yo' Sassy Ways\". In 2003 Snoop Dogg, released his series of mixtapes, from which the second compilation Welcome to tha chuuch, Vol. 2 included the first version of \"So Fly\", which is a parody of the then chart-running hit single by Monica, So Gone. Missy Elliott, a co-producer of the song (with Spike & Jamahl), got to hear the tape and was very impressed by it. She agreed with Snoop to cede the right of the sample for the upcoming 213 project in exchange for their rapping on Tamia's \"Can't Go for That\" remix. In the end it came out to be the first unofficial radio single of The Hard Way and was performed live at BET's 106 & Park. The album version differs from the mixtape version in a way that it is five seconds shorter and misses Snoop's intro where he gives the shootouts \"Welcome to tha chuuch Vol. 2...exclusive 213\". The official debut retail single was \"Groupie Luv\", which was also accompanied by a promo video. It was directed by Chris Robinson and was filmed in Snoop Dogg's own house (see also Still a G Thang). It is also the video debut for dancer Criscilla Crossland"@en ;

With this album he demonstrates his songwriting skills (every track was written by Stuart) and his diverse instrumental skills.The album has many legendary country/bluegrass legends as guest stars, such as Emmylou Harris, Pam Tillis, George Jones, Ralph Stanley, Earl Scruggs and Marty's old boss, Johnny Cash."@en ;

It features comprehensive session highlights and outtakes, while the first 19 tracks comprise an approximation of what the completed Smile album might have sounded like based on a template established in 2004 for the rerecorded Brian Wilson Presents Smile. The compilation is the first and only package devoted to the 1960s Smile recordings originally produced by Brian Wilson, arriving after decades of public anticipation and numerous false starts. The project was led primarily by audio engineers Alan Boyd, Mark Linett, and Capitol A&R director Dennis Wolfe, with Wilson acting as a remote supervisor, assisting the engineers with some mixing decisions. Wilson later stated that while the compilation is \"not a far cry\" from his original vision, he prefers his 2004 solo version. It is preceded by the similar box set The Pet Sounds Sessions (1997).

After its release, the collection was critically appreciated, with one group of reviewers noting the artistic capabilities of Madonna while the others noting her ability to re-invent her image from one video to another. It reached a peak of eight on Billboard's Top Music Video sales chart. In 2008, was certified platinum in the United States by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for shipment of 100,000 copies across United States. A box set titled The Ultimate Collection was released in 2000, which contained The Video Collection 93:99 and The Immaculate Collection compilations."@en ;

It became Trainor's breakthrough into mainstream success, topping the national charts of 58 countries worldwide and selling over 11 million copies. The EP garnered mixed reviews from contemporary music critics who commended the record's production and Trainor's vocal ability, but criticized its lyrical content. The songs \"All About That Bass\" and \"Title\" were the subject of controversy among several critics who accused both songs of anti-feminism.

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Too_Good_to_Be_True_(album)>	rdf:type	schema:MusicAlbum ;
	dbo:abstract	"Too Good To Be True is an album by The Everly Brothers, released in 2005. Consisting entirely of self-written demonstration recordings recorded between their formative years of 1957 and 1960 (except for the last track, \"It's All Over\", a solo vocal performance from brother Don in 1976), Too Good To Be True is a bringing together of almost entirely completely unreleased recordings (\"Give Me A Future\" had already been released in its complete form on the 1992 collection Classic Everly Brothers), the album was the result of a collaboration between Cary Mansfield and Andrew Sandoval, with additional research from Peggy Lamb. Having originally recorded four songs in November 1955 for Columbia, including a third-take, false-started version of the first song they recorded together, \"The Sun Keeps Shining\", a cowrite between Don Everly and Jerry Organ (the flip-side of a 45 released in February 1956 on the back of their second-ever recorded song, \"Keep A'Lovin' Me\"), all of the songs which appear on this album are original recordings. Amongst these songs are original, previously unheard recordings they made when the brothers signed for Acuff-Rose, and demo tracks of latterly released material such as \"Should We Tell Him\" and the original version of \"I Wonder if I Care as Much\". Two of the songs on this compilation had been previously heard, however. When placed alongside other songs on the Bear Family box set, \"Life Ain't Worth Living\" and \"Give Me A Future\" jar somewhat as demonstration recordings within otherwise released material, but placed in their original context, and although the latter is a mere seventy-six seconds in length, it is clear proof of their ability as early as 1956, incorporating some of the most accomplished harmony singing and triple-time guitar playing on the album. As the decade came to a close and official albums such as Songs Our Daddy Taught Us employed tighter harmony singing and the necessity for better-quality playing, the later tracks display a greater sense of rhythm and timing in the original recordings, including The New Album's solo vocal \"Dancing On My Feet\", present as a previously recorded demo on this album. Though at times the recording quality of the album is questionable, particularly on \"How Did We Stay Together\", a track on which the microphone sounds as though it is positioned a long way further back in comparison to its position in relation to the brothers on the rest of the album, since the album contains some of the first new songs released for nearly ten years by the brothers, the album is of major importance to both collectors and fans of the group. In fact, it is arguable that the singing and playing on \"Since You Broke My Heart\" is in some places of better quality, and better tuning, than in its 1959 release on Everly Brothers' Best."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Too Much Too Soon is the second studio album by American hard rock band the New York Dolls, released on May 10, 1974, by Mercury Records. The group was dissatisfied with the sound of their 1973 self-titled debut album, so frontman David Johansen enlisted veteran producer Shadow Morton for Too Much Too Soon. Morton had become disenchanted by the music industry, but was motivated by the band's energy and agreed to work with them as a challenge. They recorded the album at A&R Studios in New York City. Although the New York Dolls shared an affinity for Morton, they produced little original material with him. To complete Too Much Too Soon, they covered older songs and re-recorded their past demos. Johansen impersonated different characters on some of the novelty covers, while Morton incorporated many studio sound effects and female backing vocals in his production. For the album, lead guitarist Johnny Thunders wrote and recorded \"Chatterbox\", his first lead vocal track. Too Much Too Soon was released to poor sales and only charted at number 167 on the Billboard 200. After a problem-ridden national tour, the New York Dolls were dropped by Mercury and disbanded in 1975. The album received positive reviews from critics, who felt Morton's production highlighted the group's raw sound and made it a better record than their first. Like their debut album, Too Much Too Soon became one of the most popular cult records in rock music and has since been viewed by music journalists as a predecessor to punk rock."@en ;

It featured a reunited lineup, with Chris DeGarmo returning to contribute guitar parts and writing credits on some tracks. DeGarmo showed up for recording and was ready to tour again with the band in support of the album, but ultimately left due to clashes with singer Geoff Tate in the studio. Upon release of the disc Sanctuary Records misrepresented Chris Degarmo's involvement as a \"reunion\" with Queensr\u00FFche, which some have considered to be a PR stunt to generate sales. Tribe was self-produced by Queensr\u00FFche, with Scott Olson engineering and Adam Kasper mixing the album.The album was not commercially successful generating only 75,000 SoundScan units as of 2007. Songs such as \"Open\" and \"Losing Myself\" have been played on the satellite station, Ink'd. \"Hostage\" was a demo written by Jackson-Tate-Wilton during the Tribe sessions. But it was completed after the Tribe record was sent to the label. It was later substantially changed and re-recorded by Jason Slater and other outside writers for OM:2.

	dbo:abstract	"Turn! Turn! Turn! is the second album by the folk rock band The Byrds and was released in December 1965 on Columbia Records (see 1965 in music). Like its predecessor, Mr. Tambourine Man, the album epitomized the folk rock genre and continued the band's successful mix of vocal harmony and jangly twelve-string Rickenbacker guitar. The album's lead single and title track, \"Turn! Turn! Turn!\", was a Pete Seeger adaptation of text from the Book of Ecclesiastes that had previously been arranged in a chamber-folk style by the band's lead guitarist Jim McGuinn, while working with folksinger Judy Collins. The arrangement that McGuinn used for The Byrds' version utilized the same folk rock style as the band's previous hit singles. The album peaked at #17 on the Billboard Top LPs chart and went to #11 in the United Kingdom. The \"Turn! Turn! Turn!\" single preceded the album by two months and topped the chart in the United States. Another single taken from the album, \"Set You Free This Time\", was less successful and failed to break into the U.S. Top 50. The album marked an increase in McGuinn's songwriting output and rhythm guitarist David Crosby received his first writing credit on a Byrds' album. However, the band's prolific songwriter Gene Clark still contributed most of the original material. The album also included two Bob Dylan covers: \"The Times They Are a-Changin'\" and the then unreleased song, \"Lay Down Your Weary Tune\". Turn! Turn! Turn! would be the last Byrds' album to feature the full participation of Gene Clark until the release of the original quintet's 1973 reunion album, Byrds."@en ;

It continues the exploration of the newly created Viking metal style, and also displays heavy epic doom and classical influences; it is titled after an opera by Wagner. It is a mid-tempo, more acoustic album than previous Bathory releases, though it follows on from the Hammerheart album. Of significance is Quorthon's total control of the album, playing all electric and acoustic guitar, keyboards, bass, and drum programming. The background vocals are a particular feature of this album, with Quorthon multi-tracking himself, as he did on the Hammerheart album, though this time in a more sophisticated way, sounding like a whole chorus at times. The song entitled Hammerheart is based on a melody from Gustav Holst's The Planets. Specifically, it is Quorthon's own \"rearrangement\" of the middle section of the fourth movement, Jupiter. Originally this was to be the final Bathory album.[citation needed]"@en ;

It was released at a time when grunge was at the height of its popularity, and pop punk was slowly beginning to gather mainstream attention. AllMusic saw the album's success in the \"striking, haunting visuals that complemented the album's nihilistic yet wistful mood.\" As of July 7, 2010, Undertow has sold 2,910,000 copies in the US and been certified 2x Platinum by the RIAA.

	dbo:abstract	"Undone is the third studio album by Christian rock band MercyMe. It was produced by Pete Kipley and released on April 20, 2004 on INO Records. Following the success of MercyMe's previous studio efforts, they were given significantly more resources with which to develop the album and brought in a sixth member, guitarist Barry Graul. Unlike the band's previous songwriting style, which was to write the lyrics first, they wrote the music for the songs on the album before writing the lyrics. The album has a pop rock and adult contemporary sound, while the lyrics are personal and convey Christian themes. Undone received generally favorable reviews from critics with many praising the album's personal style, although some critics argued the album's songwriting and sound were too similar to MercyMe's previous efforts. It won the GMA Dove Award for Pop/Contemporary Album of the Year at the 36th GMA Dove Awards. In the United States, Undone debuted at number twelve on the Billboard 200 and at number one on the Billboard Christian Albums chart, selling over 55,000 copies in its first week. It spent a total of two weeks atop the Christian Albums chart and was the fifth-best selling Christian album of 2004 and the fourteenth best-selling Christian album of 2005.

Its highest UK chart position was #56, and reached #1 on the UK rock album chart. While the band's style of music is still evident in White Butterfly, their sound has changed significantly since Overgrown Eden. Dave McPherson's vocals lack the raspy angst that can be heard on the previous album and he now sings in a softer, cleaner tone. Several songs on White Butterfly also contain multiple chorused vocals that are evident in songs as \"So You Know\" and \"Faster the Chase\", and one song that is sung almost entirely by Joe Morgan, \"Almost Lost\". The album also has a lighter tone compared to the considerably darker mood of Overgrown Eden which almost had a metal-type sound to it.

	dbo:abstract	"Why Do Fools Fall in Love is a 1981 album by American singer Diana Ross on the RCA label. It reached #15 in the USA (#4 R&B), #17 in the UK and the top ten in Sweden, Norway and the Netherlands. It was the first album Ross recorded after leaving the Motown label, when she signed a $20 million deal with RCA. Originally, Nile Rodgers and Bernard Edwards were slated to produce the follow-up to the platinum Diana album. However, their schedules were filled with commitments to also produce Debbie Harry's solo debut, Johnny Mathis and another Chic album. Ross had given her word to RCA president, Robert Summers to deliver an album for the 1981 holiday selling season. The album was the first to be produced by the singer herself, and it became her second RIAA-certified platinum album (That was also misleading, since Motown was inconsistent to joining the RIAA for most of their 60s and 70s releases. She would have considerably more certifications). It was also certified Gold in the UK and Canada. The album includes the Top 10 hits \"Why Do Fools Fall In Love\" and \"Mirror Mirror\". It also includes \"Work That Body\", co-written by Ross with Paul Jabara and Ray Chew. Though it just missed the Top 40 in the United States, \"Work That Body\" was a Top 10 hit in the U.K. and Top 15 in The Netherlands. A solo version of \"Endless Love\" is also included on the album, a rerecording of her number one duet with Lionel Richie from earlier that year. \"It's Never Too Late\" was also released as a single in some international territories. Ross also embarked on a world tour in support of the album. The album was remastered and re-released on September 2, 2014 by Funky Town Grooves, with bonus material."@en ;

Records (where he had recorded as part of the Traveling Wilburys) and the first of three albums produced by Rick Rubin. Three singles were released from the album between 1994 and 1995, the most successful of which, \"You Don't Know How It Feels\", reached #13 on the Billboard Hot 100 and topped the Album Rock Tracks chart for one week. The album features all members Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers, with the exception of drummer Stan Lynch. Steve Ferrone plays drums on Wildflowers and would join the band officially the following year. However, the album was not credited to the Heartbreakers because, in Petty's words, \"Rick (Rubin) and I both wanted more freedom than to be strapped into five guys.\" Freedom notwithstanding, Petty chose to use most of his regular band as session players, demonstrating his comfort with that format. Rolling Stone placed Wildflowers at number 12 on their list of the best albums of the 1990s. Guitar World placed the album at number 49 in their \"Superunknown: 50 Iconic Albums That Defined 1994\" list. Some outtakes from this album were included on Songs and Music from \"She's the One\". In April 2015, when Petty's back catalog was released in High-resolution audio, this was the only one of two albums that was not included in the series (Songs and Music from \"She's the One\" was the other one), but a hi-rez version is available on Pono Music.

	dbo:abstract	"Wish You Were Here is the ninth studio album by the English progressive rock group Pink Floyd, released in September 1975. Inspired by material the group composed while performing across Europe, Wish You Were Here was recorded in numerous sessions at London's Abbey Road Studios. Some of the songs critique the music business, others express alienation, and \"Shine On You Crazy Diamond\" is a tribute to Syd Barrett, whose mental breakdown had forced him to leave the group seven years earlier. It was lead writer Roger Waters' idea to split \"Shine On You Crazy Diamond\" into two parts and use it to bookend the album around three new compositions, introducing a new concept as the group had done with their previous album, The Dark Side of the Moon. As with The Dark Side of the Moon, the band used studio effects and synthesizers, and brought in guest singers to supply vocals on some tracks of the album. These singers were Roy Harper, who provided the lead vocals on \"Have a Cigar\", and The Blackberries, who added backing vocals to \"Shine On You Crazy Diamond\". The album became an instant commercial success and record company EMI was unable to print enough copies to satisfy demand. Although it initially received mixed reviews, the album has since been acclaimed by critics and appears on Rolling Stone's list of \"The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time\". Band members Richard Wright and David Gilmour have each cited Wish You Were Here as their favourite Pink Floyd album, and the album is widely regarded as the group's magnum opus."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"X (pronounced ten) is the eighth studio album by English rock band Def Leppard, released in 2002 by Island Records. Much like 1996's Slang, it featured another departure from their signature sound by moving into the pop genre. The album charted at No. 11 on The Billboard 200 and No. 14 on the UK Albums Chart. Most of the album was produced by Pete Woodroffe and the band, with remaining tracks produced by either Marti Frederiksen or Per Aldeheim and Andreas Carlsson. This is the first Def Leppard album in which drummer Rick Allen actively took part in song-writing. On all of the band's prior albums, he is only credited with helping co-write 3 tracks. On this album alone, he co-wrote 11. The album features the Roman numeral 'X', recognising it as their tenth album release, although the album is in fact only their eighth collection of all-new studio material. The other two albums released by the band prior to the release of X, Retro Active and Vault, were a rerecording of B-sides and rarities and a greatest hits set respectively. The album peaked at number 11 on the Billboard 200, but did not sell to the standards of their previous releases and failed to earn any RIAA certifications. Nothing from this album had been performed live by the band since the conclusion of its supporting tour until the 'Rock of Ages' tour of 2012 during which the opening track \"Now\" was performed acoustically. For a short time after the album was released, Def Leppard's website Defleppard.com featured a free mp3 download of \"Perfect Girl,\" a bonus track and early version of the track \"Gravity\"."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"X is the tenth studio album by Australian singer Kylie Minogue. It was released on 21 November 2007 by Parlophone. It is her first release since the greatest hits compilation Ultimate Kylie (2004), and her first studio album since Body Language (2003). Work on the album began following Minogue's gradual recovery from breast cancer and subsequent radiotherapy treatment. Her cancer, which was diagnosed in May 2005, resulted in the postponement of Showgirl: The Greatest Hits Tour midway through its run. Minogue resumed the tour in late 2006, in the midst of recording X, and was completed later in the following year. The album introduced new American and European producers including Bloodshy & Avant, Guy Chambers, Calvin Harris and Freemasons. X has received positive reviews from music commentators. Many critics had commended the production, Minogue's innovative writing and many believed that it was a true welcome back to the pop scene. However, upon release, some critics were divided whether the album was a 'comeback' album and some noted the fillers and theme inconsistency. Commercially, X was a success. In Minogue's native Australia, the album debuted at number one on the Australian Albums Chart, becoming her first number-one album since Body Language (2003) and was certified platinum by the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA). In the United Kingdom, the album peaked at number four, being held off by artists Westlife, Shayne Ward (which was the highest debuting album that week) and Leona Lewis. It gained a higher position than her last record and was certified Platinum by the British Phonographic Industry. The album achieved strong charting internationally, peaking inside the top 20 in countries including Austria, Germany, Ireland, Taiwan and France. X became her lowest selling studio album in the United States, peaking at a lowest 139 on the Billboard 200. \"2 Hearts\" was released as the lead single from X. The song received mixed reviews, praising the lazy tone and production while criticizing the lack of commercial appeal and memorability. The song was a commercial success, peaking inside the top 10 in countries including Australia and Spain (peaking at number one in both territories), Italy, Ukraine, Sweden and the United Kingdom. Two singles were released on 16 and 17 February, respectively; \"Wow\" was released in Australia, Europe and the United States, while \"In My Arms\" was released in Europe. The first was positively received and achieved chart success, while the latter did not have the similar chart progression. \"All I See\" and \"The One\" were released as digital singles, the first to promote the album in the United States and the latter released in Europe. X was promoted by the KylieX2008 where she traveled around Europe, Oceania, South America, Asia and South Africa. The tour received favorable reviews from critics and was a commercial success, making it Minogue's most expensive tour at the time. Due to Minogue's lack of success in North America, she traveled there in 2009 for her tour For You, for Me to promote the album. The album was nominated for a BRIT Award for International Album in 2008, as well as a Grammy Award for Best Electronic/Dance Album in 2009, Minogue's fifth Grammy Award nomination. According to The Times, the album had sold one million copies worldwide as of December 2008."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Cornerstone is the ninth studio album by Styx, released in 1979 (see 1979 in music). Cornerstone was Styx's follow-up to their second consecutive Top 10 selling Triple Platinum album in a row, 1978's Pieces of Eight. Like the four previous Styx albums, the band produced the album themselves. The band started using a new recording studio Pumpkin Studios in Oak Lawn, Illinois. The album was the first where the band shied away from the art-rock/prog-rock influences that dominated their first eight studio albums and was the band's first move towards a more pop/rock direction (band member Dennis DeYoung stated in a 2009 interview that the change in direction came from reading bad reviews that the group received in the rock press while on their first tour of England). Dennis DeYoung had two ballads on the album. The first was the album's first single and Styx's only US #1 single \"Babe\" which Dennis wrote for his wife Suzanne. The track was performed and recorded as a demo with just him and the Panozzo brothers but then James Young and Tommy Shaw heard the track and decided to put it on Cornerstone with Shaw overdubbing a guitar solo in the song's middle section. Another ballad was the power ballad \"First Time\" which was intended to be Cornerstone's second single (radio stations were playing it and got such a response that A&M wanted it released) until Shaw complained and threatened to leave the band. \"Borrowed Time\" was released instead, reaching a disappointing #63 on the charts. DeYoung also wrote the Top 30 hit, the poppish \"Why Me\", which was the third single release from the album. Dennis predominantly used a Fender Rhodes electric piano on over half of the tracks. Also, the group used real horns and strings on the album on several tracks. DeYoung and Shaw co-wrote two tracks. The opening \"Lights\" was music by DeYoung and Shaw with lyrics by Shaw (who also sang on the track). The rocking \"Borrowed Time\" had music by DeYoung (intro) and Shaw with lyrics from DeYoung (who sang on this track). \"Borrowed Time\" would open concerts on the group's tour in support of Cornerstone nicknamed The Grand Decathlon tour. Shaw's famous song on the album was the folkish \"Boat on the River\", which became the band's biggest European hit. He also penned the pop-rocker \"Never Say Never\" and the epic proggish closer \"Love in the Midnight,\" which has been sampled to create the hip-hop song \"The Streets Been Good to Me\" by the artist Maino, on the album \"Death before Dishonor\". JY contributed the rocker \"Eddie\", which was about Edward Kennedy, pleading with him not to make a run for the U.S. presidency. Cornerstone became Styx's first US Top 5 album peaking at #2 on the Billboard album chart and is currently sitting at Double Platinum according to the R.I.A.A. although A&M said it went Triple Platinum (3 million copies sold in the US)."@en ;

Inspired by Bono's, the Edge's, and Larry Mullen, Jr.'s memberships in a Christian group called the \"Shalom Fellowship\", the record features spiritual and religious themes. Their involvement with Shalom Fellowship led them to question the relationship between the Christian faith and the \"rock and roll\" lifestyle, and threatened to break up the group. After completing the Boy Tour in February 1981, U2 began to write new material for October, eventually entering the studio in July 1981. Just as they did for their debut album, Boy, from the previous year, the group recorded at Windmill Lane Studios with Lillywhite producing. The sessions were complicated by Bono's loss of a briefcase containing in-progress lyrics for the new songs, forcing a hurried, improvisational approach to completing the album on time. October was preceded by the release of lead single \"Fire\" in July 1981, while a second single, \"Gloria\", coincided with the album release. The record received mixed reviews and limited radio play. In 2008, a remastered edition of October was released."@en ;

The album is frequently recognized as one of the crowning achievements of 1990s rap music. The album featured the Billboard Hot 100 number one singles \"How Do U Want It\" and \"California Love\". It featured five singles in all, the most of any of Shakur's albums. Moreover, All Eyez On Me (which was the only Death Row release to be distributed through PolyGram by way of Island Records) made history as the first double-full-length hip-hop solo studio album released for mass consumption. It was issued on two compact discs and four LPs. This was also the last album under Death Row to be a G-Funk record, as G Funk wouldn't exist after Daz Dillinger's album in 1998. Chart-wise, All Eyez on Me was the second album from 2Pac to hit number-one on both the Billboard 200 and the Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums charts. The album won the 1997 Soul Train R&B/Soul or Rap Album of the Year Award. Shakur also won the Award for Favorite Rap/Hip-Hop Artist at the 24th Annual American Music Awards and is also commonly referred to as one of the greatest hip hop/rap albums of all time.

	dbo:abstract	"All That Matters is an album by Michael Bolton, released in 1997, and was his first studio album since 1993's \"The One Thing\". Bolton was aided in production by Babyface and Tony Rich, and among the song writers are Bolton, Diane Warren, Babyface, Lamont Dozier, Gary Burr, and Tony Rich. The track \u201CI Don't Want to Miss a Thing\u201D, penned by Diane Warren, was the theme song for the Touchstone animated movie Armageddon. The song was nominated for a Grammy in 1998 and was performed by Bolton at that awards show. Bolton\u2019s U.S. fans were puzzled by the album\u2019s title, \"All That Matters\", until the phrase was found on the bonus track, \"When There Are No Words\", on the UK version of the album. The two singles from the album, \"The Best of Love\", and \"Safe Place from the Storm\" were disappointing in sales and radio play, and fans were disappointed that the songs were performed only a handful of times during Bolton\u2019s 1998 tour in support of the album. Despite the lead single's relative success (#24 on the Hot 100), the album failed to achieve substantial success, partly because subsequent singles from the album failed to make any significant impact on the charts and due to the altering musical tastes (which were in favor of teen-pop at the time). Thus, the album debuted at a disappointing #39 and after some weeks of descending the chart it completely disappeared from the Billboard Top 200, merely going Gold. It is Bolton\u2019s last album to be certified to date. Worldwide, the success of the album has also been limited selling just over a million copies."@en ;

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Amazing_Grace_(Spiritualized_album)>	rdf:type	schema:MusicAlbum ;
	dbo:abstract	"Amazing Grace is the fifth album by the British rock band Spiritualized, so named to indicate its considerable gospel influence. Although the title hymn does not appear on the album (Spiritualized have covered it previously, and released a free-jazz version as a b-side in 2001, and also on Complete Works Vol. 2), the ballad \"Hold On\" is based upon the same melody, and the opening track \"This Little Life Of Mine\" is clearly indebted to the spiritual \"This Little Light Of Mine\". After working with free-jazz collective Spring Heel Jack on one of their albums and tour, frontman Jason Pierce was inspired to make a record with the same principles. His approach meant that the rest of Spiritualized was given the songs on the same day as they were recorded, meaning the record (including orchestral overdubs) was completed in 3 weeks. This is a huge difference compared to its predecessor, Let It Come Down, which took four years to record. The album is generally harder-edged than its predecessors, featuring a number of variations on the familiar Spiritualized \"Electricity\" garage-rock riff. Conversely, \"The Ballad of Richie Lee\" is a tender, organ-driven tribute to the lead singer of the American group Acetone, a friend of Pierce, who committed suicide in 2001. The song was used in the final scene of the film The Unloved, whose director, actress Samantha Morton, is a close friend of Pierce's. Two singles were released, \"She Kissed Me (It Felt Like a Hit)\" and \"Cheapster.\" The former song's title is a reference to the song \"He Hit Me (It Felt Like A Kiss)\" by the 1960s girl group The Crystals, and the latter's is a likely reference to T. Rex's \"Jeepster.\" The world tour following the album's release culminated in a headline slot on The Other Stage at Glastonbury 2004 and a support slot for Primal Scream atBrixton Academy, for the Hoping Foundation charity concert, later released on DVD. The closing track on the album, \"Lay It Down Slow\", was used in the Series Finale of the American TV show Prison Break."@en ;

Americana was a major success, debuting at number six on the Billboard 200 with around 175,000 copies sold in its first week and peaking at number two for two nonconsecutive weeks, spending 22 nonconsecutive weeks in the top 10, becoming the Offspring's highest ever chart position. It is the band's second best selling album to their 1994 breakout Smash. Americana has sold more than 10 million copies worldwide, with over 9 million copies certified, while achieving 5x platinum status alone in the United States for 5 million copies shipped. The album contains the hit singles \"Pretty Fly (for a White Guy)\", \"Why Don't You Get a Job?\" and \"The Kids Aren't Alright\". Crossing over from mainstream rock and alternative rock radio to Top 40 pop radio stations, the tracks enjoyed similar success to the singles from Smash. \"She's Got Issues\", the final single of the album, was moderately well-received, though not as successful as the 3 preceding hits. The album's singles (excluding \"She's Got Issues\") were included on the band's Greatest Hits compilation.The CD version of the album also includes the music video for \"The Meaning Of Life\", a song from their 1997 album Ixnay On the Hombre, playable on DVD ROM. Americana was nominated for the 1999 MTV Europe Music Awards for \"Best Album\", but lost to Boyzone's By Request. The Offspring supported the album with a worldwide tour and appeared at the infamous Woodstock 1999, where their performance was broadcast live on pay-per-view television.

Director Jean-Pierre Jeunet chanced upon the accordion- and piano-driven music of Yann Tiersen while driving with his production assistant who put on a CD he had not heard before. Greatly impressed, he immediately bought Tiersen's entire catalogue and eventually commissioned him to compose pieces for the film. The soundtrack features both compositions from Tiersen's first three albums, but also new items, variants of which can be found on his fourth album, L'Absente, which he was writing at the same time. Beside the accordion and piano the music features parts played with harpsichord, banjo, bass guitar, vibraphone and even a bicycle wheel at the end of \"La Dispute\" (which plays over the opening titles in the motion picture). Prior to discovering Tiersen, Jeunet was primarily considering composer Michael Nyman to score the film.[citation needed] \"Les Jours tristes\" was co-written with Neil Hannon of The Divine Comedy. The track later received English lyrics, and was released by The Divine Comedy as a b-side to the Regeneration single \"Perfect Lovesong.\" The English-language version also appeared on Tiersen's L'Absente."@en ;

The album's third single, \"Barbie Girl\" brought the group to international attention after reaching number one in both Denmark and Norway, as well as across Europe and in Australia and New Zealand. It would later peak at number 7 in the US. Its success helped the album reach number one in both the group's home countries, and make the top 10 in the UK and US. While not selling as highly \"Barbie Girl\", the album's fourth single \"Doctor Jones\" was released in late 1997/early 1998 and became a number one in Denmark, Norway, Australia and the UK. \"Turn Back Time\" would later give the group their third consecutive number one single in the UK, despite only reaching number 16 in Denmark. The final single, \"Good Morning Sunshine\" failed to chart highly and was only released in select regions like the earlier \"Lollipop (Candyman)\", the group's only other song to chart in the US. The album has sold 14 million copies worldwide."@en ;

dbr:Armchair_Apocrypha	rdf:type	schema:MusicAlbum ;
	dbo:abstract	"Armchair Apocrypha is American singer-songwriter Andrew Bird's fourth studio album and his third post-Bowl of Fire album. The album features more electric guitars, a change from the more acoustic-oriented Eggs, though the songs are similar in character if slightly more straightforward. \"Simple X\" is a track started by collaborator Dosh, who wrote the music as the song Simple Exercises off his solo album, Pure Trash, with Bird adding lyrics. The track \"Imitosis\" is an expansion of the song \"I\" (also called \"Capital I\" live) on his 2003 album Weather Systems. The song \"Darkmatter\" is also a rehash of the song \"Sweetbreads\", which can be found on the live EP Fingerlings 1. Both bonus tracks also evolved from previous songs: \"Sick of Elephants\" was originally known as \"Sycophantitis\" and \"Self-Torture\" adds lyrics and incorporates the melody from the instrumental \"The Water Jet Cilice\" from Fingerlings 3. Haley Bonar, who opened some shows on Bird's tour, sings background vocals on four songs.In an interview with The A.V. Club, Bird mentioned that melodies are easier for him to write than lyrics. He was fascinated with the Scythians in 8th grade, so he decided to challenge himself to write a song about them as a way to jump-start his songwriting process. The album debuted at number 76 on the U.S. Billboard 200, selling about 11,000 copies in its first week."@en ;

The album produced an array of hit comedy singles; lead single \"Amish Paradise\", which lampoons both Coolio's \"Gangsta's Paradise\" and the Amish lifestyle, charted at number 53 on the Billboard Hot 100, while \"Gump\", which parodies \"Lump\" by The Presidents of the United States of America and the movie Forrest Gump, charted at 102. The musical styles on the album are built around parodies and pastiches of pop and rock music of the mid-1990s, largely targeting alternative rock and hip-hop alike. The album also includes style parodies, imitations of specific artists like They Might Be Giants and Elvis Costello. \"Amish Paradise\" caused a minor controversy after rapper Coolio expressed distaste at having his song parodied by Yankovic, although the two later made amends. Bad Hair Day was met with mixed to positive reviews, with many critics praising \"Amish Paradise\" in particular; \"Amish Paradise\" went on to become one of Yankovic's best-known singles. The album peaked at number fourteen on the Billboard 200. Bad Hair Day sold 1,317,000 copies in the US in 1996 alone, the highest sales tally for any comedy album in a single calendar year since Nielsen SoundScan began tracking sales in 1991. Bad Hair Day was Yankovic's sixth Gold record in the United States, and went on to be certified Platinum for sales of over one million copies in the US by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).

The tracks were recorded at Evergreen Recording Studios in Burbank, California. Manilow co-wrote with Maurice White of Earth, Wind & Fire the album track \"Only in Chicago\". \"We Still Have Time\" was taken from the film Tribute. The album scored one top ten pop hit, \"I Made It Through the Rain\", which reached number ten, in late 1980. This album was released at a time when Manilow's success was having its greatest impact overseas, particularly in the UK. His music was starting to be pushed almost entirely to adult contemporary music radio formats, known back then as easy listening. Although \"I Made It Through the Rain\" was his only Top-10 on the Hot 100 from this album, he managed to reach the Top-10 on the Adult-Contemporary lists with \"Lonely Together\" and the bouncy up-tempo \"Bermuda Triangle\" was a Top-20 hit in the UK in mid-1981. The album has yet to be released on CD in the US, but has had a CD release in Japan."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Believe is the third studio album by Canadian singer Justin Bieber, released on June 15, 2012, by Island Records. Looking to transition from the teen pop styles of his two-piece debut effort My World (2009) and My World 2.0 (2010), Bieber opted to create a follow-up record that featured more prominent elements of dance-pop and contemporary R&B. As executive producers, mentor Usher and manager Scooter Braun enlisted collaborators including Darkchild, Hit-Boy, Diplo and Max Martin with the intention of creating a mature-sounding project. Upon its release, Believe received generally favorable reviews from music critics, who appreciated its progression from Bieber's earlier works. It debuted at number one on the US Billboard 200 with first-week sales of 374,000 copies, and was later certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for sales exceeding one million units. Internationally, the record enjoyed similar success. It debuted atop the Canadian Albums Chart, where it eventually attained double-platinum recognition. The album additionally debuted at number one on the UK Albums Chart, and was later certified gold there. According to the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI), Believe was the sixth global best-selling album of 2012 with sales of three million copies. Five singles were released from Believe, several of which became international successes. Its lead single \"Boyfriend\" peaked at number two on the US Billboard Hot 100, and reached number one on the Canadian Hot 100. Follow-ups \"As Long as You Love Me\" and \"Beauty and a Beat\" performed moderately worldwide, and positioned within the top-ten in the United States and Canada. \"Right Here\" received little promotion, consequentially peaking in the lower end of the Billboard Hot 100, while the final single \"All Around the World\" performed moderately in most markets. The project was additionally promoted through the Believe Tour in 2012 and 2013. The remix album Believe Acoustic was released in January 2013."@en ;

It was mixed and mastered by Dan Swan\u00F6 at Unisound Studio. The album's artwork was created by Olli Lappalainen. Beyond is one of the most anticipated releases by the band since they made their breakthrough with their previous album New World Shadows. As stated by guitarist Markus Vanhala on the band's official website \"The album follows the good known path of \u201CNew World Shadows\u201D and \u201CThe Redshift\u201D but adds a lot of new flavours and spices to the good ol' melting pot to lift the band to a new heights.\" Markus also stated that Beyond is their most melodic and versatile album so far but still holds the brutal side in terms of Jukka Pelkonen's vocals. The basic theme of the album is about the culmination point of one's existence. It is a coming home story where the mysteries of duality are melted into oneness but without losing one single point of individuality along the arrival. On January 9, 2013, the band released the teaser track \"New Dynamic\" on YouTube via Facebook page. The official music video for \"The Unknowing\" was released on February 6, 2013."@en ;

Aguilera enlisted a wide range of producers for the project, including her longtime collaborator Linda Perry, and new collaborators including Christopher \"Tricky\" Stewart, Polow da Don, Ladytron, Sia and Samuel Dixon. Inspired by Aguilera's taste of electronic music, Bionic was described as an electro-R&B and futurepop record. Its first half consists of mostly electropop tracks, while the second half features a more balladic production. The album's main lyrical themes are sex and feminism. Bionic received mixed reviews from music critics, who were ambivalent towards its production and lyrical content. Commercially, the album struggled to match the chart impact and sales of her previous releases. It debuted at number three on the U.S. Billboard 200 with first-week sales of 110,000 copies, and has sold 330,000 units there as of September 2012. In the United Kingdom, Bionic debuted atop the UK Albums Chart with the lowest debut sale figure in eight years, and later became the largest drop in chart position for a number one album in the chart history. As of November 2012, the record has sold nearly one million units globally. Bionic yielded two international singles: \"Not Myself Tonight\" and \"You Lost Me\". \"Woohoo\" was released in the United States and some European countries, while \"I Hate Boys\" was exclusively released in Australia and New Zealand. In support of the album, Aguilera made several appearances on TV and in live shows in 2010 to promote the album, including The Oprah Winfrey Show, American Idol, and Today. In May, she initially planned to further promote the album by embarking on The Bionic Tour, which was cancelled shortly afterwards."@en ;

It was released on October 5, 2011, by One Little Indian Records and distributed by Nonesuch Records in North America and by Universal Music Group in the rest of the world. It can be categorized as avant-garde music, alternative dance and experimental music. Bj\u00F6rk composed it as a concept album during the 2008\u201311 Icelandic financial crisis, exploring the links between nature, music and technology. Billed as the first \"app album\", Biophilia is a multimedia project released alongside a series of apps linking the album's themes to musicology concepts. It was followed by a series of educational workshops in four continents. Four singles were issued before the album's release in 2011. \"Crystalline\", co-produced with English dubstep duo 16bit, was released as the lead single on June 28, 2011, accompanied by a music video directed by longtime collaborator Michel Gondry. It was followed by the singles \"Cosmogony\", \"Virus\" and \"Moon\". Bj\u00F6rk promoted the album with the Biophilia Tour, which began at the Manchester International Festival in June 2011 and ended in September 2013. A bonus track on the deluxe edition of Biophilia, \"N\u00E1tt\u00FAra\", was released as a digital single in 2008 around the time the Biophilia project began. \"N\u00E1tt\u00FAra\" was added as part of a series of bonus tracks after an early online leak of the album weeks before its release date. Biophilia received critical acclaim and was named one of the best albums of 2011 by several publications; it was nominated for two awards at the 55th Grammy Awards in 2013, winning Best Recording Package. It debuted in the top 40 of every chart it entered worldwide, topping the Taiwan chart and peaking in the top 5 in Iceland, France and Denmark.

	dbo:abstract	"Black Box: The Complete Original Black Sabbath (1970\u20131978) is a collection of the first eight albums by the heavy metal band and a DVD of 4 videos. The set contains the albums recorded with original singer Ozzy Osbourne, who was fired in 1979 after completion of the band's Never Say Die! tour. This marked the end of the group's original line-up that featured Osbourne, guitarist Tony Iommi, bassist Geezer Butler and drummer Bill Ward. All eight albums are digitally remastered and repackaged in mock vinyl LP packaging, including an 80-page booklet with liner notes written by Henry Rollins, Chris Welch, and Brian Ives. The discs included in the set are as follows: They are represented as they appeared when first released, with the exception of the debut album, which has a revised track order as it includes both the song \"Evil Woman\" from the original European LP\u2014deleted from North American editions because of copyright problems\u2014and \"Wicked World\", which was substituted for it. The discs are kept in digipak cases, with all original LP artwork intact. The CDs themselves are entirely black, but retain the lettering used for each individual release, as opposed to a uniform stylized font. True to its title, the nine discs are housed in a solid black case, complete with gothic imagery and lettering. Inside, there are two smaller boxes containing four CDs each. Also enclosed is a booklet, which contains the DVD in a sleeve attached to the inside back cover. The booklet traces the entire history of the band, with essays, interviews, timelines, and the lyrics to every song personally checked by Geezer Butler, the band's main lyricist. Previously, a 1996 remastered box set had been issued by Castle Communications, which used unknown source tapes and did not involve any input from the band. For the Rhino set, all of the songs have been digitally remastered from the original Warner Bros. tape archives, as was the earlier Rhino compilation Symptom of the Universe."@en ;

Joel Pott explained the album title: \"We read an article about Nassim Nicholas Taleb and his book The Black Swan. He was saying that our lives are made up of a handful of significant shocks, good or bad. That's exactly how our journey has been over the last six years. We've had lots of unexpected highs and lows, as a band and as people.\" Black Swan comes from a desire for \"getting the songs across as much as we could\".

Songs from this album, such as \"Bridge of Sighs\", \"Too Rolling Stoned\", \"Day of the Eagle\", and \"Little Bit of Sympathy\", have become live concert staples for Trower. The album was produced by organist Matthew Fisher, formerly Trower's bandmate in Procol Harum. Acclaimed Beatles engineer Geoff Emerick was this album's sound engineer. In a recent interview in Guitar World , Robin Trower explained how the album got its title. Robin said that he had had the first line of the song for years and then one day he saw some sport pages which listed a racehorse called Bridge of Sighs and thought that would be a great title. Bridge of Sighs (Chrysalis 1057) reached #7 in the United States during a chart stay of 31 weeks. It was certified Gold on 10 September 1974. Early printings of the original album cover had the front image upside-down, and were more greenish in colour. The title track was covered by Opeth for the special edition of their 2008 album Watershed. \"Day of the Eagle\" was covered by Billy Idol guitarist Steve Stevens on his 3rd solo album Memory Crash.

	dbo:abstract	"Burnt Offerings is the third studio album by American heavy metal band Iced Earth. Released on April 18, 1995, it was the group's first album since 1991's Night of the Stormrider, after which the band took a three-year layoff. During this time they recruited drummer Rodney Beasley and singer Matthew Barlow, replacing Rick Secchiari and John Greely, respectively. Burnt Offerings has been described as the Iced Earth's heaviest and darkest record. Rhythm guitarist and main songwriter Jon Schaffer has said that the heaviness of the songs were a result of his frustration with the music industry. Schaffer's frustration is particularly evident in the title track, which talks about the problems the band had to endure during its downtime. The album is also notable for including one of the longest songs Iced Earth has ever recorded; \"Dante's Inferno\". Clocking in at 16 minutes and 26 seconds, \"Dante's Inferno\" is based on the Inferno -segment of Dante Alighieri's epic poem, the Divine Comedy. The album starts with a spoken line from Bram Stoker's Dracula. The album's original cover art was also a painting by Gustave Dor\u00E9, of Lucifer from the Divine Comedy."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Cannibal is the debut extended play (EP) by American recording artist Kesha, released on November 19, 2010. The EP is a follow-up companion to her debut album, Animal. Originally, the record was thought to be released as a deluxe edition of Animal, but was instead sold and released as both an EP and a deluxe edition of Animal. Kesha worked with a variety of producers and writers such as executive producer Dr. Luke, Benny Blanco, Ammo, Max Martin, Bangladesh and others. Musically, the songs on Cannibal are of the dance-pop genre, with some songs incorporating elements of electro and electropop in their production and beats. Throughout the album, the use of Auto-Tune and vocoders is prominent. Lyrically, the songs on Cannibal speak of ignoring judgement or hate and experiences based on love and heartbreak. Cannibal received generally positive reviews from music critics. However, a common complaint amongst critics was the overuse of Auto-Tune, while the album's production was generally highlighted. The album's lyrics generally polarized music critics; some praised her boldness, while others criticized them as being too raunchy. In the United States, the EP reached a peak of fifteen selling 74,000 copies in its first week of release. In Canada, the album achieved similar success reaching a peak of fourteen on the chart. Cannibal was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for shipment of 500,000 copies. Two singles were released from the album. The lead single, \"We R Who We R\", was a worldwide success, reaching number one in the United States, the United Kingdom and Australia, and charting within the top ten in numerous other countries. In the United States, the song became the seventeenth song in the Billboard Hot 100's history to debut at number one. The album's second single, \"Blow\", was released on February 8, 2011. The song accomplished top ten positions in multiple countries including Australia, New Zealand and the United States."@en ;

On his recent hit single \"Half Crazy,\" Gill's husky, powerful baritone would lead to you to think he'd been around the love wars long enough to do some postgraduate work. But the cover photo for his \"Chemistry\" album and the \"Half Crazy\" video show a slightly built kid with a soft, innocent stare, looking like he just got out of high school. Which he has...For his new album he was teamed with veteran producer and songwriter Linda Creed, who had worked with Thom Bell on the Delfonics', Stylistics' and Spinners' recordings but dropped out of the business for five years to raise her family...That new combination, he feels, is going to put him that much closer to his dream: 'to sell 40 million copies like Michael and then get into the movies.' Luckily Gill's strengths as a ballad singer coincide with commercial radio's currently receptive attitude toward medium tempo, romantic material...But will the world go along with a ballad singer who's so young? 'That's what we've all got to find out very soon,' Gill says evenly. 'I know this one may not go gold. But I'm going to spray paint it.'\" --Excerpted from \"The Ballads of Johnny Gill,\" Washington Post, June 22, 1985 Peter Judge wrote, \"This is one of those albums that should have been bigger. Gill is only 18 but as far as singing he can hang with the big boys. Gill's rich tenor makes a song like \"Half Crazy\" a real gem.

Produced by Roy Bittan, the original album - featuring Chicago's interpretations of well-known Christmas classics plus one original tune (co-penned by Lee Loughnane) - was very well received upon its release in August 1998, peaking at #47 in the US and going gold during a stay of 7 weeks on the charts. After Chicago entered into a long-term partnership with Rhino Records in 2002, that label re-issued Chicago XXV: The Christmas Album that same year. It was further decided to record six additional Christmas songs - with Hot Streets and Chicago 13 producer Phil Ramone - and re-issue the whole package in 2003 under a new design, title and sequencing, entitled What's It Gonna Be, Santa?, deleting its predecessor in the process. It has been reported that the band had initially considered recording an entirely new holiday effort, but didn't due to cost factors.[citation needed] Guitarist Keith Howland sang his first lead vocal on the track, \"Jolly Old Saint Nicholas\".[citation needed] This later release reached #102 in the US during a stay of 5 weeks on the charts."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Choose Your Masques is the thirteenth studio album by the English space rock group Hawkwind, released in 1982. It spent five weeks on the UK albums chart peaking at #29. The group's line-up for this album remained unchanged from the previous Church of Hawkwind album, although for this recording the group started to heavily use drum machines and drum loops, with most of Griffin's contributions being relegated to disjointed drum fills. Griffin was unhappy with this role, and group-leader Dave Brock was dissatisfied with Griffin's time keeping, so they mutually agreed to part company, although Griffin reluctantly agree to fulfil the scheduled tour commitments. The album was recorded in June and July 1982 at Rockfield Studios. Science fiction author Michael Moorcock contributes lyrics to the album but credited his wife Lynda Steele to bypass his music publisher Douglas Smith with whom he was in dispute. The lyrics to \"Fahrenheit 451\", which had been written by former lead singer Robert Calvert and originally recorded but unused in 1978, were based on Ray Bradbury's book Fahrenheit 451. The album makes use of samples, featuring Ian Holm from a 1981 BBC Radio 4 serialisation of The Lord of the Rings on \"Dream Worker\", and the spoken introduction of The Outer Limits on \"Void City\". \"Silver Machine\" and \"Psychedelic Warlords\" are re-recordings of the early 1970s singles which were not originally intended for inclusion on the album. The group undertook a 29 date UK tour in November and December to promote the album, with support from the Spanish rock group Baron Rojo. Saxophonist and singer Nik Turner re-joined the group for this tour. Recordings from this tour have been issued on the albums Zones (1983), Out & Intake (1987) and Choose Your Masques: Collectors Series Volume 2 (1999)."@en ;

All of the tracks on the album were written by Billy Griffin and Miracles bass singer Pete Moore. Freddie Perren and Moore served as the album's producers. The album's first single, \"Love Machine\", peaked at number-one on the Billboard Hot 100 on March 6, 1976, and was a multi-million-selling Platinum single, becoming the most successful single of The Miracles' career. Its success coincided with the rise of the disco craze of the late 1970s. Another song on City of Angels, \"Ain't Nobody Straight in L.A.\", caused controversy due to addressing the subject of homosexuality: \"Ain't nobody straight in L.A./It seems that everybody there is gay\""@en ;

Bonniwell, who had been the creative force behind the innovative garage rock band The Music Machine. The album was released on August 4, 1969, by Capitol Records (see 1969 in music). It marked a total departure from Bonniwell's rebellious protopunk period with The Music Machine, to a soft rock crooning style. In addition, the album blended folk rock and orchestrated influences, and was inspired by Bonniwell's stints in the pre-Music Machine groups, the Wayfarers and the Ragamuffins, along with his desire to be more poetically inclined. The song,\"Where Am I to Go\", was released as a single ahead of the album, but failed to chart.

The album is widely perceived by fans and critics (and Kim herself) as Wilde's most well-balanced, with many kinds of pop represented: dance, ballad, rock and midtempo. The album's lead single was \"Hey Mister Heartache\", featuring backing vocals from Junior Giscombe \u2013 but its success was dwarfed by the follow-up single, \"You Came\", which hit the Top 10 in many countries and just missed the US Top 40. \"Never Trust a Stranger\" and \"Four Letter Word\" also reached the UK Top 10, although a fifth single \"Love in the Natural Way\" was less successful. Attention for the album was bolstered by Kim's support slot on Michael Jackson's European tour. Close reached the Top 10 in the UK, almost all Scandinavian countries, Austria and Germany and went on to become Wilde's biggest selling album, being certified platinum in the UK and shifting more than 2 million units worldwide. In Australia, the album was less successful, peaking at #82 on the ARIA albums chart. A 2-CD 25th Anniversary Edition of Close was released in the United Kingdom in September 2013, with the album's original 10 tracks bolstered by an additional 21 B-sides and remixes."@en ;

One song from the album, \"Come Down\", hit the Billboard Modern Rock and Mainstream Rock Charts, and the single \"Crazy Life\" explores the perceived injustices experienced by Leonard Peltier. \"Whatever I Fear\" was also released as a single but failed to chart with poor backing from Columbia Records; thus in turn, the planned fourth single \"Dam Would Break\" was never released."@en ;

It was very successful, becoming Amuro's fourth number one single and fourth million-seller. The second single, \"Can You Celebrate?\", was released on February 19, 1997. Used as the theme song for the TV drama Virgin Road, it was an unprecedented commercial success: It sold over 2.7 million physical copies and remains the best-selling physical single by a female soloist in Japanese history. It charted for forty-nine weeks and was certified double Million by the RIAJ, her first and only single to receive such a certification. A re-release for Christmas 1997 sold over 400,000 copies itself. The rock-infused third single, \"How to Be a Girl\", reached number one and sold over 770,000 copies. Concentration 20 received mixed reviews from critics. The songs and production were praised, though some critics dismissed Amuro's limited vocal range and Komuro's backing vocals. Nonetheless, it was a big commercial success. The album entered the Oricon albums chart at number one with first-week sales of 824,980 copies. It charted for 28 weeks, and was the seventh best-selling album of the year, selling nearly two million copies. Combined with the sales of its singles, Concentration 20 has sold around 4.5 million copies."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"DaDa is the fifteenth studio album by Alice Cooper, released in 1983. DaDa would be Cooper\u2019s last album until his sober re-emergence in 1986 with the album Constrictor. The album\u2019s theme is ambiguous, however, ongoing themes in the songs\u2019 lyrics suggest that the main character in question, Sonny, suffers from mental illness, resulting in the creation of many different personalities. The album alludes strongly to the dadaist movement: its cover was based on a painting by Salvador Dal\u00ED titled \u201CSlave Market with the Disappearing Bust of Voltaire\u201D. Produced by long-time collaborator Bob Ezrin, at the time his first production with Cooper in six years, DaDa was recorded at ESP Studios in Buttonville, Ontario, Canada. DaDa reached #93 in the UK and failed to dent the US Billboard Top 200. \u201CI Love America\u201D was released as a single solely in the UK over a month after the album\u2019s release. Guitarist and co-songwriter Dick Wagner recently[when?] revealed that Cooper had relapsed to drinking heavily during the recording of DaDa, and had suggested that the album was a contract fulfillment requirement for which Warner Bros. Records was not pleased and consequently made no effort to promote, though Warner Bros. has never confirmed or denied this. This and other details, like the real-life cocktail waitresses that inspired \u201CScarlet and Sheba\u201D are in his autobiography Not Only Women Bleed. Cooper reportedly has no recollection of recording DaDa, or the preceding albums Special Forces and Zipper Catches Skin, due to substance abuse. Cooper stated \u201CI wrote them, recorded them and toured them and I don\u2019t remember much of any of that\u201D, though he toured only Special Forces. In 1996 Cooper said that DaDa was the scariest album he ever made, and that he never had any idea what it was about. There was no tour to promote DaDa, and none of its songs have ever been played live. DaDa was Cooper\u2019s final album for his long-time label Warner Bros., and after its release he took a three-year hiatus from the music industry."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Dead Winter Dead is a concept album by Savatage, released in 1995 dealing with a Serb boy and a Muslim girl who fall in love. The story of the album also focused on the Bosnian War, which was ongoing at the time. This album featured the return of Chris Caffery, who featured on Savatage's 1989 release Gutter Ballet. Alex Skolnick, who had played guitars on Savatage's previous album Handful of Rain, opted not to stay around for the next album in order to concentrate on his solo band. Singer Jon Oliva took drummer Jeff Plate from the Handful of Rain tour, and brought in his old friend, former member and Doctor Butcher member to join the band. Atlantic Records also felt that the band needed a second, more well-known guitarist to complete the line-up. Al Pitrelli, formerly a member of Alice Cooper's touring band, became the lead guitarist for the band. This record gave the band an unexpected radio hit in \"Christmas Eve (Sarajevo 12/24)\", and the band decided they wanted to explore this kind of music in a different way. Around this time, Paul O'Neill, along with Robert Kinkel, was interested in starting up what became the Trans-Siberian Orchestra. It was later re-released by TSO as \"Christmas Eve/Sarajevo 12/24\" on their first release, Christmas Eve and Other Stories.

According to Steve Williams, \"the concept of the album came about as an accident. We didn't write 'Bored With Russia'. Don (Smith) brought that over from America and that started the ball rolling. We played it a few times and it started the whole concept\". The song was written by noted producer Beau Hill, erroneously credited as Bo Hill, and demoed up with his late 70's outfit Airborne. It was finally issued on the band's 2003 archives release The Dig. Reception of the album was mixed, due to a more commercially oriented sound than previous releases. It has been described as either \"a complete musical shipwreck\" or \"a collection which not only sounds fantastic but bristles with great songs and exquisite often Who-like arrangements\". Their commercial appeal has been justified as a \"conscious effort to broaden their horizons\" in order to attend \"a market more attuned to melody than mere muscle\".

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Deluxe_(Harmonia_album)>	rdf:type	schema:MusicAlbum ;
	dbo:abstract	"Deluxe is the second album from the highly influential Krautrock/Kosmische Musik group Harmonia. Harmonia was formed by the addition of Neu! guitarist Michael Rother to Cluster, the duo of Hans-Joachim Roedelius and Dieter Moebius. Deluxe was recorded in June, 1975 in Harmonia's studio in Forst, Germany. It was first released on the Brain Records label in 1975. It was produced by the band members and legendary Krautrock producer, Conny Plank. Ned Raggett's review for Allmusic opens: \"A touch more immediate and song-oriented than its predecessor, but no less enchanting and lovely to hear, Deluxe again features the trio experimenting with a variety of approaches, most particularly including vocals here and there for the first time.\" The Ground and Sky review by Joe McGlinchey describes Deluxe, in part: \"The album also has more of a drive to it than the first Harmonia album, perhaps in part to Rother's guitar being much more upfront and noticeable, as well as the addition of Guru Guru drummer Mani Neumeier on some tracks.\" Neumeier performs a lengthy jam on the track \"Walky Talky\". Ned Raggett adds: \"The motorik pulses and rhythms, however soft and subtle, still dominate the proceedings, while the glazed, warm feeling of the whole album is astounding.\" Deluxe ranked at #41 among Krautrock albums in sales at Amazon.com as of 3 September 2007. Musician, writer, and rock historian Julian Cope included Deluxe in his Krautrock Top 50. CDs of Deluxe first appeared in 1994 on the Germanofon label. This dubious company based in Luxembourg released numerous Krautrock albums without proper authorization or paying royalties, in effect producing bootlegs that somehow found their way into mainstream distribution. The Germanofon CDs were transfers from vinyl LPs and generally were of inferior sound quality. The album was not properly released on CD until 24 October 2004 on the Motor Music label, a subsidiary of the Universal Music Group. It was also reissued by Universal in Japan in 2005, by the Russian label Lilith in 2006, and by the Revisited Records label in 2007."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Diorama is the fourth studio album by Australian alternative rock band Silverchair. Released on 31 March 2002 by record label Eleven, the album was co-produced by Daniel Johns and David Bottrill. While Bottrill had worked on albums for a variety of other bands, Diorama marked the first production credit for lead singer Johns. Johns wrote most of the album at the piano instead of his usual guitar, while the band took a 12-month break following their previous studio album, Neon Ballroom. Silverchair worked with composer Van Dyke Parks on Diorama; the album contains numerous orchestral arrangements and power ballads, a change from the post-grunge music typical of their earlier work, but consistent with the band's previous orchestrations on Neon Ballroom. The album's title refers to \"a world within a world\". Five singles were released: \"The Greatest View\", \"Without You\", \"Luv Your Life\", \"Across the Night\" and \"After All These Years\". All except \"After All These Years\", a promotional single, appeared on the Australian singles chart. Diorama was successful in the charts but was not as well received by critics as the band's earlier albums. It reached number one on the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) Albums Chart and received a rating of 71 (out of 100) on review aggregator Metacritic. It was certified triple-platinum by ARIA, selling in excess of 210,000 copies, and won five ARIA Awards in 2002. Diorama was nominated for Highest Selling Album in 2003, and three songs from the album were nominated for awards over the two years."@en ;

The final film excluded \"My Mother's Eyes,\" despite it being released as a single, and \"Shiver Me Timbers\" was not featured in the home video release (VHS or DVD). Footage of these songs have not been restored.

The album peaked at number 1 in the UK charts, and it eventually led to a Madness reunion and their first concert in six years (which was recorded for their Madstock! album).

In 2000 it was re-issued, under its original title of Divine Madness, with the further singles \"Lovestruck\" and \"Johnny the Horse\" included, but once again omitting \"The Sweetest Girl\".

The overall sound of the album is slightly flat and compressed, to give a similar sound to the varying productions of each track which are taken from the albums between the years 1974 up to 1977.[citation needed] The Japanese single release of \"Strutter '78\" includes a different version to that on the album: faster and shorter, with an altered guitar solo, plus a more prominent hi-hat (cymbal) sound throughout."@en ;

Dreamweaver is a concept album based on the 1983 book by psychologist Brian Bates - \"The Way of Wyrd: Tales of an Anglo-Saxon Sorcerer\". The album demonstrated singer and lyricist Martin Walkyier's deep held beliefs in Wyrdism, Anglo-Saxon spirituality, Celtic mysticism and paganism. Musically the album reflected composer Andy Sneap's predilection at that time for increasingly lengthy and progressively technical thrash metal songs. Shortly before the album was recorded, former Holosade guitarist Simon Jones was recruited into the band as an additional lead and rhythm guitarist. The album has come to be regarded as a classic of the thrash metal genre, described variously upon its re-release in 2007 as \"essential listening\" (Rock Sound), a \"staggering work of total excellence\" (Kerrang!), a \"seminal chapter in the evolution of British metal\" and one of the \"finest metal albums ever made\" (Metal Hammer)."@en ;

He also worked on the production of his former Clash partner's, Mick Jones second album with the band Big Audio Dynamite in 1986. It was the reception and sales of the music score from the film Walker that got Strummer into a well mental state to start working on his own material again. He got a group together which consisted of Zander Schloss, Lonnie Marshall, Jack Irons and Willie MacNeil. The backing band became known as The Latino Rockabilly War. The first project the band worked on was for the film Permanent Record with Keanu Reeves which featured the songs \"Trash City\", \"Baby the Trans\", \"Nothin' 'bout Nothin\", \"Nefertiti Rock\", and the haunting instrumental \"Theme from Permanent Record\".

	dbo:abstract	"East Side Story is the fourth studio album by new wave group Squeeze. The initial concept was for a double-LP with one side produced by Elvis Costello, another by Dave Edmunds, a third by Nick Lowe and the fourth possibly by Paul McCartney. Ultimately it was largely produced by Costello and Roger Bechirian, and released on one disc. The album peaked at number 19 in the UK Albums Chart, spending 26 weeks in the listing. However, Edmunds did produce the album's opening track, and sessions with Lowe yielded \"Looking For A Love\". This latter track (and one other album outtake produced by Bechirian and Costello) was appended to a 1997 UK CD reissue of East Side Story, as part of the band's Six of One... box set. The set included the band's first six studio albums, all digitally remastered. A year later, each separate CD (including the expanded East Side Story) was made available for individual purchase. The album was a definite break with Squeeze's \"New Wave\" sound, as it contained songs influenced by rockabilly, R&B, blue-eyed soul, Merseybeat, and psychedelia among other genres. It also contained Squeeze's last top 10 UK single, \"Labelled with Love\". East Side Story was the first album for new keyboardist Paul Carrack. He sang lead on the track \"Tempted\", which became Squeeze's first U.S. chart hit. Shortly after the release of this album, Carrack left the band for a solo career, but he returned to Squeeze for a time in the early 1990s, playing and singing on the Some Fantastic Place album."@en ;

The album debuted on the U.S. Billboard 200 chart at number three, selling 90,000 copies in its first week. It was certified gold on October 12, 2007. Yamin promoted the album during 2007 with a nine-month tour of clubs, small theaters and radio-station holiday shows across the United States, plus shows in Canada, the Philippines, and Malaysia. The album was released in Japan on May 21, 2008 by Avex Trax. The Japan version has been retitled Wait for You and includes bonus tracks \"In Love With You Forever\" and \"Believe\". It was certified Gold there in September 2008. On October 8, 2008, a Premium Edition of the album was released in Japan, including 2 more tracks: \"A Whiter Shade of Pale\" and \"I'll Make You Dance\", plus Yamin's cover version of \"Home\", originally from Japanese singer Yusaku Kiyama, who recorded a Japanese version of \"Wait for You\" in return. On the Billboard.com's end of decade charts, Elliott Yamin's self-titled debut album, Elliott Yamin, has been placed at number 39 on the top independent albums of the decade list."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Every Good Boy Deserves Favour is the seventh album by The Moody Blues, released in 1971. The album was the last to feature only the Mellotron, as it would be assisted by the Chamberlin (another device that uses recorded tape to generate sound) on the Moody Blues' next studio album, 1972's Seventh Sojourn. This album featured the only track to be written by all five members of the band. The opening \"Procession\" was a piece that was intended to describe the history of music from the beginning of time up until the album's recording. The only three words heard in this track \u2013 \"desolation,\" \"creation,\" and \"communication\" \u2013 were similarly used (along with many other \"-ation\" words) in \"One More Time to Live.\" The album reached #1 on the British album charts, in addition to a three week stay at #2 in the United States, and produced one top-40 single, \"The Story in Your Eyes.\" The track \"Emily's Song\" was written by John Lodge for his newborn daughter. Mike Pinder wrote and sang the album's concluding track \"My Song\", which showcased his abilities on the mellotron and piano. The title is taken from the student mnemonic for the lines of the treble clef: E-G-B-D-F. These notes are heard played on piano during \"Procession.\" The album was mixed and released in both stereo and quadraphonic. In April 2007 the album was remastered into SACD format and repackaged with the two extra tracks. In 2008 a remaster for standard audio CD was issued with the same bonus tracks. The front cover has been imitated by the leader of the dark progressive band Current 93, David Tibet, for Halo, a live album released in 2004."@en ;

It was released to European digital stores through 2007. Recording sessions for the album took place during Fall of 2004 to January 2006, most of which was recorded after the third single from the album \"Everytime We Touch\" rose to popularity. The entire album was produced by Yanou and DJ Manian, containing heavily of up-tempo Eurodance tracks, many of which are covers of hit songs from the 1980s and 1990s of the synthpop, Eurodance, and rock genres. Musically, the album is composed of dance tracks with thick Euro synths, trance beats that clock in at over 140 beats per minute and Europop lyrics. Lyrically, the album is composed of songs about love and dance floor euphoria. Critical reception of the album has been mixed to negative, with many critics disliking the repetitive beats and what they saw as filler. Most critics did admire, however, its chart success for a dance album in the tough US music market. The album has sold about 2 million copies worldwide. There was a total of seven singles released from the album. \"Miracle\" and \"Everytime We Touch\" were released in America and were the only singles that received gold and platinum certifications. Along with \"Truly, Madly, Deeply\", these singles attained notable chart success internationally, peaking in the top ten in countries like the United Kingdom, Ireland and Sweden. \"Bad Boy\" and \"Ready for Love\" were released as the second and the seventh single from the album and failed to attain any chart success. \"A Neverending Dream\" and \"How Do You Do!\" achieved minor chart success in Ireland, the United Kingdom and Austria respectively."@en ;

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Extra_Texture_(Read_All_About_It)>	rdf:type	schema:MusicAlbum ;
	dbo:abstract	"Extra Texture (Read All About It) is the sixth studio album by English musician George Harrison, released in September 1975. It was Harrison's final album under his contract with Apple Records and EMI, and the last studio album issued by Apple. The release came nine months after his troubled 1974 North American tour with Ravi Shankar and the poorly received Dark Horse album. The melancholic mood of the recording reflects Harrison's depressed state at the harsh criticism generated by these projects. Among his solo releases, Extra Texture is notable as the only album whose lyrics are devoid of any obvious spiritual message. Uniquely also, it was recorded mostly in America rather than England, while Harrison was working in Los Angeles in his role as head of Dark Horse Records. Gary Wright, David Foster, Jim Keltner, Jesse Ed Davis, Leon Russell, Tom Scott, Billy Preston and Jim Horn were among the many contributing musicians. The keyboard-heavy sound incorporates elements of soul music and the influence of mellow-voiced Smokey Robinson, signalling a further departure by Harrison from the rock and folk-rock approach of his popular early-1970s work. Contrasting with the musical content, the album's art design adopted an upbeat theme, which included an innovative die-cut cover. Despite its generally downcast mood and an unfavourable response from music critics, Extra Texture was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America within two months of release. It produced a hit single in the Motown-inspired \"You\", originally recorded in London in 1971 with co-producer Phil Spector. The album also includes \"This Guitar (Can't Keep from Crying)\", which was both a sequel to Harrison's 1968 Beatles composition \"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\" and a rebuttal to his detractors. The album was reissued in remastered form on 22 September 2014, as part of the Apple Years 1968\u201375 Harrison box set."@en ;

This compact disc features songs by her previous bands: KUKL, The Elgar Sisters, and The Sugarcubes. \"Roots CD 2\" features b-sides and alternate versions of album tracks; \"Beats\", which focuses on both new and old songs with a heavier electronica influence; and finally \"Strings\", CDs 1 and 2, which feature live and studio recordings of Bj\u00F6rk with the Brodsky Quartet through 1999 and 2000.

M\u00FDa worked with a wide range of producers and songwriters on the album which included Rodney Jerkins, Swizz Beatz, Wyclef Jean, Knobody, Robin Thicke, Tricky Stewart, and Jimmy Jam & Terry Lewis to embrace a more mature sound. Fear of Flying is a metaphor for the ups and downs of life. It's about handling things like an adult, knowing you must have faith to make anything happen. The album showcased M\u00FDa experimenting with a wider genre of music such as reggae, soul, and hip-hop and served as a departure from her conventional structure of her debut studio album M\u00FDa (1998); representing a musical promise fulfilled, combining saucy femininity and no-nonsense assuredness. It was the sound of a budding composer and song stylist discovering her creative voice and reflections of being in love for the very first time, experience success, and the fears of fame. Fear of Flying spawned three singles including; the Swizz Beatz-produced street savvy anthem \"The Best of Me\" featuring Jadakiss and worldwide pop sensational hits \"Case of the Ex\" and \"Free\". The former was an instant success worldwide, it reached the top twenty in over eight countries including United States, United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, Ireland, New Zealand, Belgium and Netherlands. The latter became an international hit; it reached the top twenty in two countries the United Kingdom and Australia. Fear of Flying debuted at number fifteen on Billboard 200 chart on May 13, 2000 with first-week sales of 72,000 copies. Upon its release, the album seemed to be suffering from the dreaded sophomore slump. The first single, \"The Best of Me\" under-performed on the charts, not even making it into the pop Top 40. The follow-up, \"Case of the Ex\" proved to be a different matter. Interscope Records issued a commercial single for the song, which helped propel it to number two, and in turn solidified the album as a hit; re-releasing Fear of Flying on November 7, 2000 with two previously unreleased tracks. The album earned a platinum certification by Recording Industry Association of America on March 28, 2001 and two gold certification by Australian Recording Industry Association and Canadian Recording Industry Association."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Gaucho is the seventh studio album by the American jazz rock band Steely Dan, released in 1980. The sessions for Gaucho represent the band's typical penchant for studio perfectionism and obsessive recording technique. To record the album, the band used at least 42 different musicians, spent over a year in the studio, and far exceeded the original monetary advance given by the record label. During the two-year span in which the album was recorded, the band was plagued by a number of creative, personal and professional problems. MCA, Warner Bros. and Steely Dan had a three-way legal battle over the rights to release the album. After it was released, jazz musician Keith Jarrett threatened the band with legal action for writing credit on the title song \"Gaucho\". Gaucho marked a significant stylistic change for Steely Dan, introducing a more minimal, groove and atmosphere-based format. The harmonically complex chord changes that were a distinctive mark of earlier Steely Dan songs are less prominent on Gaucho, with the record's songs tending to revolve around a single rhythm or mood. Gaucho proved to be Steely Dan's final studio album before a 20-year absence from the recording industry."@en ;

It was the band's second full studio album with lead singer Steve Augeri and drummer Deen Castronovo, confirming the line-up of 2001's Arrival and 2002's Red 13 EP. The album was given away for free by the band during most of the concerts of the Generations Tour in 2005, and subsequently released on Sanctuary Records later the same year. This was the first Journey album where all of the band members share the lead vocalist duties. Jonathan Cain sings lead on \"Every Generation\" and \"Pride of the Family\", the first time he sang lead since \"All That Really Matters\" (a song originally left off Frontiers) from the Time3 box set. Deen Castronovo sings lead on \"A Better Life\" and \"Never Too Late\". Neal Schon provides lead vocals for \"In Self Defense\" (previously recorded for the Schon & Hammer album Here to Stay) and Ross Valory lends his vocals to \"Gone Crazy\". Peaking only at No. 170 on the Billboard 200 album chart, Generations was the last album to feature Augeri, who left the band mid-tour in 2006 due to a throat infection. Jeff Scott Soto replaced him and toured with the band until June 2007. It was also the only Journey album released by the now-defunct Sanctuary Records. The latter portion of the song \"Faith in the Heartland\" was heard during the December 10, 2006 edition of NBC's Football Night in America, during a segment about Dallas Cowboys quarterback Tony Romo. \"Faith in the Heartland\" and \"The Place in Your Heart\" were re-recorded by the band with new vocalist Arnel Pineda on their 2008 album Revelation, but \"The Place in Your Heart\" was only released as a bonus track on the Japanese edition of that album."@en ;

The album was recorded live in Seattle during the winter of 2007-2008 and focuses on manipulated electric guitar sounds, equally influenced by shoegazing, ambient techno and 4AD's early catalog. According to several interviews, The Sight Below didn't use any synthesizers on Glider. The ambient drones and soundscapes on the album were created by performing with a viola bow or light pick and running guitars thru a chain of reverb, delays and looping effects, with a stronger emphasis on textures and a subliminal rhythmic patterns. The album was very well received by the press and music community, including praise from Radiohead's Thom Yorke, who charted \"At First Touch\" on his January 6, 2009 \"Office Chart\" posting on the band's website Dead Air Space. Glider shares its title with a 1990 My Bloody Valentine EP, an influence on The Sight Below's music. Glider's desolated artwork imagery was created and design by graphic artist Michael Cina.

The program itself premiered through the Disney Channel on March 24, 2006; after becoming an immediate commercial success, production on its soundtrack began the following month. Eight of its thirteen tracks are performed by the series' primary actress Miley Cyrus, and are credited to her titular character Hannah Montana. The groups The Click Five, Everlife, B5, and recording artist Jesse McCartney each contribute one recording, while a duet between Cyrus and her father Billy Ray Cyrus is included as the final track. The soundtrack is primarily a teen pop record, which sees additional influences from pop rock and country pop musical styles. The lyrical themes revolve largely around \"girl power\", teen romance, and the double life that Cyrus' character lives on the program. Hannah Montana received generally favorable reviews from music critics, who appreciated its overall production. It debuted at number one on the U.S. Billboard 200 with first-week sales of 286,000 copies. In doing so, it became Cyrus' first number-one album, the first television soundtrack to reach the peak position on the chart, and the fourth soundtrack from The Walt Disney Company to debut in the top-ten of the chart. The record has since been certified triple-platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), having exceeded shipments of three million copies in the United States. The soundtrack charted moderately on international record charts, having reached the top-twenty in countries including Austria, Canada, Norway, and Spain. The series' theme song \"The Best of Both Worlds\" was released as the only single from Hannah Montana on March 28, 2006. It reached number 92 on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100. Hannah Montana was reissued as a two-disc special edition on March 20, 2007. It spawned the additional single \"Nobody's Perfect\", taken from the series' second season, and peaked at number 27 on the Billboard Hot 100. The soundtrack was further promoted during the The Cheetah Girls' Party's Just Begun Tour, for which Cyrus served as an opening act, and her own Best of Both Worlds Tour."@en ;

Title track \"Holy Land\" contains many indigenous and folkloric influences taken from Brazilian music, but also includes classical arrangements symbolizing Europe at the time. The opening track \"Crossing\" features a rendition of O Crux Ave by Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina. The following songs deal with life in the \"holy land\" prior to its colonization by the Portuguese and subsequent changes Brazil underwent upon their arrival. According to drummer Ricardo Confessori, the track \"Nothing to Say\" was developed around a drum riff he created around 1994 at a small rural property owned by guitarist Rafael Bittencourt. His band mates heard it and soon joined in to create the rest of the song, including the single-note opening riff."@en ;

Produced by Mark Knopfler and Dylan himself, Infidels is seen as his return to secular music, following a conversion to Christianity, three evangelical, gospel records and a subsequent return to a less religious lifestyle. Though he has never abandoned religious imagery, Infidels gained much attention for its focus on more personal themes of love and loss, in addition to commentary on the environment and geopolitics. Christopher Connelly of Rolling Stone called those gospel albums just prior to Infidels \"lifeless\", and saw Infidels as making Bob Dylan's career viable again. According to Connelly and others, Infidels is Dylan's best poetic and melodic work since Blood on the Tracks. The critical reaction was the strongest for Dylan in years, almost universally hailed for its songwriting and performances. The album also fared well commercially, reaching #20 in the US and going gold, and #9 in the UK. Still, many fans and critics were disappointed that several songs were inexplicably cut from the album just prior to mastering\u2014primarily \"Blind Willie McTell\", considered a career highlight by many critics, and not officially released until it appeared on The Bootleg Series Volume III eight years later."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Infinity on High is the third studio album by American rock band Fall Out Boy, released on February 6, 2007 by Island Records as the follow-up to the band's commercially successful 2005 album From Under the Cork Tree. Pre-production began in the group's hometown of Chicago, where writing and rehearsal sessions took place. It was recorded from July to October 2006 at the Pass Studios in Los Angeles, California and mixed at the Paramount Recording Studios in Hollywood. The music was composed by lead singer and guitarist Patrick Stump and the lyrics were penned by bassist Pete Wentz. The album features collaborations with new producers and guest artists such as Babyface and Jay-Z, and sees the band experimenting with musical genres other than pop punk including R&B, soul, and flamenco. The group also utilized instruments such as horns, violins and pianos, which had not been used on previous releases. As reported by Billboard, Fall Out Boy \"drifts further from its pop punk roots to write increasingly accessible pop tunes,\" a slight departure from the group's previous sound. Critics felt that the lyrics served as a response to the band's rise to fame. The group embarked on several tours to promote the album, including the Friends or Enemies Tour, the Honda Civic Tour, and the Young Wild Things Tour. In the wake of the album's leak on the internet, the band included a download code for Leaked in London, a live extended play, with each purchase made during the first week of its initial release. Infinity on High debuted at number one on the U.S. Billboard 200, selling 260,000 copies in its first week, making it Fall Out Boy's first number one album and second top ten effort. It also reached number one in New Zealand and opened inside the top five worldwide in countries including Canada, the United Kingdom and Australia. Infinity on High has sold over two million units worldwide, with 1.4 million sales in the US as of February 2013. Four of the album's fourteen songs were released as singles, of which three charted on the Billboard Hot 100, led by the lead single \"This Ain't a Scene, It's an Arms Race\" at number two. The album was certified Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) on March 12, one month after its release, for shipments of one million copies. It received generally positive reviews from music critics, with many praising Stump's vocals and the album's new musical direction."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Insomnia (\u30A4\u30F3\u30BD\u30E0\u30CB\u30A2 Insomunia) is the debut album by Japanese singer-songwriter Chihiro Onitsuka, released in March 2001. The album features acoustic-oriented production arranged by Takefumi Haketa, who produced all her studio albums released under the Virgin Tokyo label distributed by Toshiba EMI. It comprises 11 tracks written by Onitsuka, including hit singles \"Cage\", \"Edge\",\"Memai\", and her most well-known and successful song \"Gekk\u014D.\" The lead-off track \"Gekk\u014D\" was initially used as a theme song for Trick starring Yukie Nakama and Hiroshi Abe, a television drama series aired on Asahi TV in 2000. It was released as a single in August 2000 and became smash hit. At the end of the album, different rendition of the song was included. While \"Gekk\u014D\" remained on the chart, \"Cage\" and \"Memai\" were released as the singles subsequently. The lyrics of the latter was acclaimed, winning the 43rd Japan Record Awards for \"Best Lyrics\" in December 2001. It became the first top-ten hit single for her, peaking at the number-six on the charts. Before Onitsuka gained popularity through \"Gekk\u014D,\" she had already released a single \"Shine\" arranged and produced by Nozomu Tsuchiya. A song was newly recorded for the Insomnia album. Album version arranged by Haketa features stiff sound of piano he plays. Likewise, a song originally released as a B-Side for her debut single called \"Back Door\" was also re-recorded. \"Rasen\" (a song whose working title was \"My Fragile Life\") was featured on the 2002 motion picture Wasabi directed by Luc Besson and starred by Ry\u014Dko Hirosue. Music videos of 7 tracks included on the album were produced; \"Gekk\u014D\" (both single and album versions), \"Cage,\" \"Memai,\" \"Edge,\" \"We Can Go,\" and studio live take of \"Shine.\" All of them has been available on DVD entitled Me and My Devil issued in April 2001."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Jagged Edge is a 2-disc album of alternate versions and remixes of songs from the album Jagged. When Numan started recording the album Jagged he was to use Andy Gray as the producer, who previously worked on the 2-disc compilation album Hybrid. A version of \"Jagged\" and work on a track called \"Does God Bleed?\" (which eventually became \"Halo\") were the only outcomes from these session with Gray, and he eventually had to leave the project. Numan went back to Pure producers Sulpher to work on the album, and again there were delays caused by the birth of Numan's second daughter and record label politics. Because of these events, only six tracks were completed. These tracks were used for Jagged Edge along with new reworkings remixed and produced by the original album co-producer, Ade Fenton. The album was not offered on General release and available through Nuworld the Official Gary Numan website only, and due to this, Jagged Edge becomes the least selling album to date."@en ;

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jolene_(album)>	rdf:type	schema:MusicAlbum ;
	dbo:abstract	"Jolene is Dolly Parton's 13th solo studio album, produced by Bob Ferguson. It was released by RCA Records in February 1974. The title track, \"Jolene\", tells the tale of a housewife confronting a beautiful seductress who she believes is having an affair with her husband. It became Parton's second solo number-one country single; it also was a moderate pop hit for her, and also did well in the United Kingdom. It has been covered by numerous performers. The album was released around the time Parton was embarking on a solo career, after having spent seven years as part of Porter Wagoner's weekly TV series and road show, and one of the album's songs, \"I Will Always Love You\", was reportedly written to express the remorse Parton felt over the professional breakup. Released as the album's second single, it also became a number-one country single. In 1992, Whitney Houston's version of \"I Will Always Love You\" was a mega-hit pop ballad. Two of the album's songs had been released on previous Parton albums: \"Early Morning Breeze\" was a remixed version of a recording which had first appeared on 1971's Coat of Many Colors album (the Jolene version was remixed to more prominently feature the bass and electric steel), while \"Lonely Coming Down\" had first appeared on Parton's Wagoner tribute album, My Favorite Songwriter: Porter Wagoner, from 1972. Another re-issue was released in conjunction with Dolly's 2007 European Tour along with two other older out-of-print albums. This re-issue included additional previously unreleased songs. In 2010, Sony Music reissued the 2007 CD Jolene in a triple-feature CD set with Coat of Many Colors and My Tennessee Mountain Home and they have never been out of print."@en ;

dbr:Judy_at_Carnegie_Hall	rdf:type	schema:MusicAlbum ;
	dbo:abstract	"Judy at Carnegie Hall is a two-record live recording of a concert by Judy Garland at Carnegie Hall in New York. This concert appearance, on the night of April 23, 1961, has been called \"the greatest night in show business history\". Garland's live performances were big successes at the time and her record company wanted to capture that energy onto a recording. The double album became a hit, both critically and commercially. Judy Garland's career had moved from movies in the 1940s, to elaborate vaudeville stage shows in the 1950s. During this period, she broke many box office records, making her concert appearances events unto themselves. She also suffered from extreme drug and alcohol abuse, and had become overweight, and very ill, by 1959. After a long convalescence, weight loss, and vocal rest, she returned to the concert stage with a simple program of 'just Judy.' Garland's 1960-1961 tour of Europe and North America was a success, and her stage presence was highly regarded; eventually she was billed as 'The World's Greatest Entertainer'. Garland's concert mania was on the rise when she visited Carnegie Hall in Manhattan, and many reviews of her shows commented on her showmanship, vocal maturity, and the emotional effects that her performances delivered. Audiences were documented as leaving their seats and crowding around the stage to be closer to Garland, and often called her back for encore after encore, even asking her to repeat a song after her book of arrangements was completed. On the evening of the Carnegie show, after a bombastic overture that built high emotion, Judy appeared, looking remarkably healthy, and well-groomed, to a very loud ovation from the star-studded audience. The recorded applause illustrates the energetic connection between Garland and her fans. Her audience that night included theatre performers on their usual Sunday night off, and the celebrities appeared to be as enthusiastic as the rest of the audience. Photographs on the liner notes show the audience, in evening dress, lining the stage as was indicative of a Garland performance. Hedda Hopper (who was in attendance), reviewed Garland's ability to embrace her concert audience by saying of the show, \"..I never saw the likes of it in my life.\" All reviews of the show gave Garland high marks, and commented on her healthy appearance, exuberance, energy, vocal power, and the uplifting emotional power that Garland has on her audience. By all accounts, the evening's performance was a resounding success, even if it had not been recorded. The release of Garland's record set, only two months after the concert, cemented her comeback from illness, and brought her a new public acclaim. The double album was a huge best seller\u2014charting for 73 weeks on the Billboard chart, including 13 weeks at number one, and being certified gold. It won four Grammy Awards, for Album of the Year (the first live music album and the first album by a female performer to win the award), Best Female Vocal Performance, Best Engineered Album, and Best Album Cover. The album has never been out of print. In 2003, the album was one of 50 recordings chosen that year by the Library of Congress to be added to the National Recording Registry."@en ;

But it also includes songs that can fire up the party, most evidently on the explosive Beenie Man collaboration \"Belly Danza.\" Spearheaded by Eliel, the sprawling 18 tracks of King of Kings exhibit a surprising variety; songs like the hit lead single, \"Angelito\", are moody and different-sounding, though still unquestionably reggaeton in style.

	dbo:abstract	"Knock Knock is the seventh album by Bill Callahan (also known as Smog), released in January 1999 on Drag City and by Domino in Europe. The album is the fourth and final collaboration with the producer and musician Jim O'Rourke. Knock Knock elaborates Callahan's sound and provides twists and edges to the folky style of its predecessor. \"Held\" was the first single, followed by \"Cold Blooded Old Times\", which later appeared on the High Fidelity film soundtrack, thereby attracting some attention to Callahan's work. Other soundtrack appearances include \"Teenage Spaceship\" in Crazy (2000, directed by Hans-Christian Schmid) and \"Hit the Ground Running\" in Swimming (2000, directed by Robert J. Siegel). The album was accompanied by the release of the single \"Look Now\", with the two Japanese bonus tracks. Loren Mazzacane Connors plays guitar on \"Teenage Spaceship\" and\"Sweet Treat\", Thymme Jones plays drums, Jim O'Rourke plays piano and \"Wurley\" plays guitar. Callahan has said the cover is a reference to \"two zen tenets - that of life being like a flash of lightning or a wildcat's roar\" (Smog interview in Ink Blot magazine), though others have speculated that it is a reference to Cat Power, who had been in a relationship with Callahan immediately prior to the writing of the album."@en ;

The lineup is the same as on the Legion of Mary album, except that the drummer is Ron Tutt's predecessor in the band, Paul Humphrey.

The first lineup of the Jerry Garcia Band also included Kahn and Tutt, along with Nicky Hopkins on piano.

Co-produced by Chic's Nile Rodgers, the album contained three of his most successful singles; the title track, \"Let's Dance\", reached No. 1 in the UK, US and various other countries, \"Modern Love\" and \"China Girl\" both reached No. 2 in the UK. \"China Girl\" was a new version of a song which Bowie had co-written with Iggy Pop for the latter's 1977 album The Idiot. The album also contains a re-recorded version of the song \"Cat People (Putting Out Fire)\" which had been a minor hit for Bowie a year earlier. Let's Dance was a stepping stone for the career of the Texas blues guitarist Stevie Ray Vaughan, who played on it. The album was released as a limited edition picture disc in 1983. Let's Dance has sold 10.7 million copies worldwide, making it Bowie's best-selling album. Let's Dance is Bowie's 18th official album release since his debut in 1967, including two live albums, one covers album (Pin Ups, 1973), and a collaboration with the Philadelphia Orchestra (1977). At one point Bowie described the album as \"a rediscovery of white-English-ex-art-school-student-meets-black-Amefican-funk, a refocusing of Young Americans\". The success of the album surprised Bowie, who felt he had to continue to pander to the new pop audience he acquired with the album. This led to Bowie releasing two further solo albums in 1984 and 1987 that, despite their relative commercial success, did not sell as well as Let's Dance, were poorly received by critics at the time and subsequently dismissed by Bowie himself as his \"Phil Collins years\". Bowie would form the hard rock and grunge-predecessor band Tin Machine in 1989 in an effort to rejuvenate himself artistically."@en ;
