dbr:Band_of_Gypsys	rdf:type	schema:MusicAlbum ;
	dbo:abstract	"Band of Gypsys is a live album by Jimi Hendrix and the first without his original group, the Jimi Hendrix Experience. It was recorded on January 1, 1970, at the Fillmore East in New York City with Billy Cox on bass and Buddy Miles on drums, frequently referred to as the Band of Gypsys. The album mixes funk and rhythm and blues elements with hard rock and jamming, an approach which later became the basis of funk rock. It contains previously unreleased songs and was the last full-length Hendrix album released before his death. After his appearance at Woodstock with an interim group that included Cox, Hendrix began developing new songs and recording demos. When Miles became involved, he and Cox agreed to record a live album with Hendrix to be used to settle a contract dispute with a former manager. The new material, influenced by Cox's and Miles' musical approaches, signal a new direction for Hendrix. Songs such as \"Power to Love\" and \"Message to Love\" still maintain the dominant role of Hendrix's guitar, but show funk and R&B influences. Lyrically, they also explore new, more humanistic themes for Hendrix. The two numbers written and sung by Miles bear the stylings of soul music. The anti-riot/anti-war \"Machine Gun\", draws on Hendrix's earlier blues aspirations, but incorporates new approaches to guitar improvisation and tonal effects. As the album's producer, Hendrix had a difficult time completing the task. Presented with the sometimes problematic recordings and resigned to turning it over to a different record company, Hendrix expressed his dissatisfaction with the final product. Shortly after its release, Band of Gypsys reached the top ten of the album charts in the US and UK as well as appearing in charts in several other countries. Although it was as popular as his albums with the Experience, it received mixed reviews. Some faulted the performances as tentative and underprepared; additionally, Miles' contributions on drums and vocals have been characterized as plodding and obtrusive. However, \"Machine Gun\" is generally regarded as the album's highlight and one of Hendrix's greatest achievements. The influence of Band of Gypsys is heard in the funk rock developments of the 1970s and has been cited as an inspiration by various later rock musicians. Reissues of the album on compact disc included three extra songs recorded during the Fillmore East shows and additional material has been released on later albums."@en ;

The covers in this Marathon are of anime from the 1960s and 1970s. A karaoke version of this album was also released. This is also the only studio album to feature the band as a quartet; all other releases have the band as a trio with a guest drummer. \"Gatchaman no Uta,\" \"Combattler V no Theme,\" \"Yuusha Raideen,\" \"Tatakae! Casshan,\" \"Mazinger Z,\" \"Getter Robo\" and \"Devilman no Uta\" were previously recorded as a six-minute marathon and independently released as the band's self-titled 1996 EP. \"Uchuu Senkan Yamato,\" \"Umi no Triton,\" \"Great Mazinger,\" \"Tatakae! Polymar,\" \"Tiger Mask,\" \"Babel II\" and \"Taga Tame ni (Cyborg 009 theme)\" were recorded as a separate marathon titled This is Animetal. Majority of this album was mixed with tracks from This is Animetal, Tokusatsu de Ikou!, Animetal Summer, Animetal Lady Sanjo!, Animetal Lady Kenzan and Animetal Lady Marathon and released internationally as This is Japanimetal Marathon. Some songs in the marathon incorporate guitar riffs from classic hard rock and heavy metal songs. For instance, \"Suki da Dangard Ace\" uses the intro riff of Led Zeppelin's \"Communication Breakdown.\" The album cover's unnamed skeleton mascot is a parody of Iron Maiden's Eddie the Head and Megadeth's Vic Rattlehead. He also appears on Animetal Marathon II, Animetal Marathon III and Best of Animetal, as well as the band's singles. A female counterpart is used on Animetal Lady's album covers."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Below the Waste is Art of Noise's fourth full-length original album and their last album for China Records before Anne Dudley reformed with ZTT's Trevor Horn and Paul Morley for 1999's The Seduction of Claude Debussy. The album saw the group experimenting with world music, collaborating with South African Zulu group Mahlathini and the Mahotella Queens, who provide a heavy layer of mostly non-English-language vocals on three tracks (Yebo, Chain Gang and Spit). The album was produced by Anne Dudley, Ted Hayton and J.J. Jeczalik. The album represents the diverging interests of the two remaining members of the original group, Anne Dudley and J.J. Jeczalik. Dudley's influence is evident in the album's ambient interludes of melodic, orchestral pieces, while Jeczalik's influence can be heard in the album's dub tracks and harder, rock-edged pieces. The latter songs also feature arrangements more typical of the band's earlier material, utilising sampling techniques, lengthy fade-outs, a diverse mixture of classical instruments, guitar riffs and percussion typical of industrial music. Like its predecessor, In No Sense? Nonsense!, the album also features cover versions of previously recorded themes composed for television and film, namely \"Robinson Crusoe\" (originally the theme to the 1964 television programme The Adventures of Robinson Crusoe) and \"James Bond Theme\" which was submitted for the soundtrack of the 1989 James Bond film Licence to Kill and subsequently rejected by the film's producers.[citation needed]. The \"Emphasis Speakers\" on the album cover were designed by Morten Villiers Warren for B&W. The orchestra was led by John Bradbury[disambiguation needed]. Although the album was praised for its collaboration with Mahlathini and the Mahotella Queens, the reviews for the album were mostly negative, with Allmusic music reviwer Dean Carlson calling the album a 'misfire' and compared it to 'world mall-music'."@en ;

Musically it represents the most sophisticated and most symphonic edge of AD-music. There\u2019s more diversity on this album than never before. This is the first time we used a real choir and we gathered some really excellent professional opera singers together to be able to achieve the best sounding choir possible.

This album won \"Rap/Hip Hop Album of the Year\" at the 2010 Dove Awards. It is a concept album about the fictional character Chris Carlino."@en ;

The guitar sound on this album is significantly cleaner than that on any previous album the band had released, with the exception of the band's folk album Songs of Grief and Solitude. Critics and fans noticed a strong influence from post-rock and such bands as Alcest. Due to these features the record received mixed reviews, though it appeared in Haunting the Chapel's Top 50 Albums of 2010 at the number 8 position. Again, for lyrics was used the poetry of Ukrainian authors, such as Oleksa Stefanovych and Svyatoslav Gordynskyj.

The album won the 1999 Grammy Award for Best Contemporary Jazz Album, while \"The Roots of Coincidence\", an uncharacteristically aggressive song with hard rock-inspired sections, won Best Rock Instrumental Performance. This album marks the final appearance of longtime drummer Paul Wertico, who would leave in 2001 before the recording of Speaking of Now to work on other projects. The album leans heavily toward world fusion, drawing upon a variety of global influences. Indonesian styles are particularly pronounced, with Balinese gamelan music appearing in \"Imaginary Day\" and \"Into the Dream\". \"The Heat of the Day\" demonstrates repetitive hints of Iranian folk music. Imaginary Day also showcases the Group's first (and thus far, only) forays into rock music and drum and bass with \"The Roots of Coincidence\". In \"The Awakening\", the album concludes with strongly Gaelic melodies. \"The Awakening\" and \"Follow Me\" have been played on The Weather Channel during Local on the 8s. The liner notes use an image substitution cipher throughout. The CD and CD tray can be lined up to one of three different keys (red, yellow or blue) to translate the majority of the liner notes, which include quotations from authors as well as a short essay by Metheny and Rodby. For example, lining up the arrow on the CD to the red square on the CD tray will decode the front cover as \"PAT METHENY GROUP IMAGINARY DAY\". Cover art by Stefan Sagmeister."@en ;

It contains 27 songs from ten different releases with a total running time of nearly two and a half hours. Limited pressings of the album came in a purple slipcase which featured the band logo wrapped around all four sides. As with the previous album, only a few thousand of these were produced, and the limited edition is these days a much-sought-after rarity. The compilation set is split up in two discs. The first disc (on the packaging referred to as \"The Black Disc\") contains tracks from their studio releases, while the second disc (\"The Silver Disc\") lists unreleased and more obscure releases from the group. The songs are in no particular order; the discs jump back and forth between albums several times."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"The Smoking Popes Tribute is a tribute album to the Chicago-based pop punk band the Smoking Popes. It was released March 25, 2003 by Double Zero Records, a label founded by former Smoking Popes drummer Mike Felumlee. Following the Smoking Popes' breakup in 1998, Double Zero had released several albums of previously recorded Smoking Popes material including 1991\u20131998, Live, and The Party's Over. The Smoking Popes Tribute features contributions from former members of the Smoking Popes themselves: Felumlee performs a cover of \"Don't Be Afraid\", while Josh and Eli Caterer perform \"Do Something\" with their post-Smoking Popes act Duvall. Other notable contributors to the album include Bad Astronaut, Grade, and The Ataris. Critic Tim Sendra of Allmusic remarked that a Smoking Popes tribute album seemed incredulous at first, since the band released only a few albums and did not have much mainstream success, but noted that \"the Smoking Popes were influential in a small way. Along with Weezer, they were one of the few post-Dookie bands to add more pop than punk to their mix of punk-pop and became a source of inspiration to many of the melodically inclined emo bands.\" He also noted the oddity of the former Smoking Popes appearing on their own tribute album, saying \"Most bands or artists being tributed tend to steer clear of the process \u2014 it seems wrong somehow to be paying tribute to yourself. No matter, the record is a well-chosen and played tribute to the music and career of the Smoking Popes and fans will no doubt be thrilled.\""@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"The Two Ring Circus, released in 1987 on Mute Records in the UK and Sire Records in the U.S, is a remix album from Erasure that served as a companion piece to their second album The Circus. The vinyl version was a double 12\" album playing at 45rpm, featuring 6 previously unreleased remixes and 3 re-recordings. The CD and cassette editions featured an additional 7 live bonus tracks billed as \"The Touring Circus\". UK chart rules at the time made The Two Ring Circus ineligible to chart[citation needed]. It became their second release to briefly slip into the Billboard 200 chart, peaking at number 186[citation needed]. The first six tracks on The Two Ring Circus were all new remixes of songs that had already appeared on their second album \"The Circus\". The next three tracks were re-recordings of two songs from The Circus and one song from the band's first album Wonderland. All three were orchestral arrangements by Andrew Poppy. The 7 \"Touring Circus\" bonus live tracks on the CD and cassette mainly feature songs from Erasure's first two albums. The last track, a live version of \"Gimme! Gimme! Gimme! (A Man After Midnight)\" was their first remake of an ABBA tune, foreshadowing a concept that would later provide them with a number-one in the UK in 1992 with the Abba-esque EP. All 7 of the CD and Cassette live bonus tracks were recorded in Hamburg and were previously featured on the triple 12\" single release for \"The Circus\". There was a further live song per 12\" not featured on this album. All 10 of these live tracks (plus an 11th originally featured on the \"Victim Of Love\" CD Single) are featured on disc 2 of the \"EBX 2\" box-set. The US editions of the CD and cassette also included an additional remix in the form of an edited version of a previously released remix."@en ;

The first of the band's many live and part-live albums, it was mostly recorded at gigs in the north of England, but the track \"New Puritan\" was recorded at Mark E. Smith's home and \"That Man\" is a studio recording, an outtake from the recording sessions for the \"Fiery Jack\" single. Rather than record themselves in front of a receptive home crowd, The Fall chose to use recordings made in working men's clubs and other less obvious settings; side one of the album was recorded at a leisure centre near Doncaster while the first two tracks on side two are from a February 1980 gig in Bradford. It is clear on the recording that the reception the band received veered from indifferent to hostile. Even more peculiar is \"No Xmas For John Quays\", a song originally heard on Live At The Witch Trials. In this version Mark E. Smith intersperses the lyrics with ferociously worded criticisms of the band's performance."@en ;

The band had rehearsed the song for a two-part tribute album (Tribute to Accept vol. 1 & 2) in 1999 but didn't have any extra time to record it. So, they decided to include the song on A Virgin and a Whore. The album cover art was made by Niklas Sundin of Cabin Fever Media and guitarist of Dark Tranquillity."@en ;

The album is more optimistic than previous Clarks albums, mainly because the band members were becoming increasingly satisfied in their personal relationships (a very large number of older Clarks songs talk of break-ups). The band remained a force in the Pittsburgh market and in several surrounding areas, but still failed to break out into the national scene. This was despite a much hyped performance on the Late Show with David Letterman. Singles from the album still had regional popularity. \"Hell On Wheels\" became an instant classic in terms of driving songs, while \"Shimmy Low\" featured an excellent hook and optimistic lyrics. However, the band was not ready to give up on its long history of depressing songs just yet. The third single, the title track \"Fast Moving Cars,\" invoked the feelings of drunkenness and loneliness."@en ;

Named for the last line of a 175-year-old hymn written by William Gadsby, according to Webb, She Must and Shall Go Free \"is an emphatic statement about the liberation and ultimate security of the people of god -- the church.\" A result of Webb's questioning his role in the \"church\" and its role in culture, She Must and Shall Go Free is a poignant and challenging look at what it means to purse faith in today's church-laden culture."@en ;

dbr:Someday_Maybe	rdf:type	schema:MusicAlbum ;
	dbo:abstract	"Someday Maybe is the 1996 fourth album by Pittsburgh band The Clarks. The record constituted both the band's first and last major label release. After two successful local records on a self-created label, MCA inked a deal with the band, giving them at least a shot at national success. However, MCA was in financial disarray at the time, due to it being bought out by a larger corporation. In turn, many struggling or newly signed bands were cut from the label. Before 'Someday Maybe' received any promotion, The Clarks were one of many bands that saw their contracts with MCA be terminated in 1997. Despite this heartbreak, the album did perform well in Pittsburgh. 'Stop!', a song that could draw comparison's 'For What It's Worth' by Buffalo Springfield, was intended to be the band's first nation single. Instead, it was relegated to only local success. The traditional rock love song 'Caroline' and the Southern rock influenced 'Mercury' were also major hits in the Pittsburgh market. The Clarks' problems with MCA nearly ruined their careers, and it certainly left them disillusioned with the recording industry. It would take 4 years for the band to release their next album."@en ;

According to Suzette Quintanilla's YouTube video, EMI teamed up with Q-Productions (a division of Selena's father's recording studio) to release this box set, and Quintanilla asks Selena fans around the world to contribute a special message to Selena that may or may not be included in the new box set. The Box-sets will contain an exclusive \"Selena\" charm and four booklets that include messages from Selena's family, friends, and fans from around the world. Selena fans around the world were told to collaborate pictures of themselves to be part of the La Leyenda bound books, but in early February 2010, Q-Productions and Capitol Latin decided to cancel the transaction due to legal actions with copyrighted images from fans."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Beyond Recognition is the third full length album, and final until 2009's The Prophecy by thrash metal band Defiance, released in 1992 on Roadrunner Records. This album was a bit of a departure from the band's previous work. It can be best described as \"progressive thrash metal\", featuring more complex song structures, odd time signatures, numerous key and tempo changes, technical riffs and drumming, and even clean sections that often evoked jazz fusion. This newer, more distinctive style earned the band their biggest critical success to date, and many fans hail it as their finest work. Despite this, the album did not sell as well as their previous works due to a shifting musical landscape and as a result, poor advertisement for the album. It has been out of print for many years, though many thrash fans consider it to be a lost gem of the genre. During the recording of Beyond Recognition vocalist Steev Esquivel temporarily left the band due to lack of focus due to drug addiction. He came back later when the band was not satisfied with their replacement vocalist. All of the tracks on the album still had Esquivel on lead vocals. Former Heathen vocalist Dave White makes a guest appearance on \"Looking Inside Out\", doing a vocal harmony with Esquivel during the chorus line. Ed Repka also did the cover art."@en ;

ns40:_All-Star_Duets_with_the_Queen	rdf:type	schema:MusicAlbum ;
	dbo:abstract	"Jewels In The Crown is a duets compilation album by American Soul singer Aretha Franklin. It was released in 2007 by Arista, and comprises a combination of classic duets spanning Franklin's career, and two newly recorded duets with Fantasia and John Legend. It also contains two live duets, one from 1993, the other from 1998. The album concludes with a previously released rendition of \"Nessun Dorma\", of which Franklin had performed a version at the Grammy Awards of 1998, when she filled in last minute for Luciano Pavarotti. The first and only single, \"Put You Up On Game\" featuring Fantasia, was released to radio on October 1, 2007. The single peaked at a disappointing #41 on Billboard's R&B Singles chart and never charted on the Pop side. However it was Aretha's biggest R&B hit since \"Here We Go Again\" reached the top 30 in 1998. During her career Franklin has also recorded duets with Ray Charles, The Four Tops, and James Brown; however, these songs are not included on the album; neither is a duet she reportedly recorded with Christina Aguilera. The album peaked at a modest #54 on the Billboard album chart, and at #7 on the R&B Albums chart. As of 2012, the album had reportedly sold close to 65,000 copies in the United States."@en ;

The album was recorded in a home studio in Cuernavaca and in Los Angeles, California. The album was released in November 1995 by BMG Ariola. The ten songs Trevi consolidated production as a composer, which include subjects who returned to give much to speak of homosexuality as a religious, economic crisis and political corruption. The artist began to feel the effects of the veto by Televisa after the company's American Connections sold the rights to two of their programs to TV Azteca. Treviwas absent from multiple channels broadcast from the end of that year and promotion If you take me with you suffered. Ella Que Nunca Fue Ella (She Who Was Never Herself) and Si Me Llevas Contigo (if you take me with you) ... were the only two singles from the album, both tracks are ballads, which had moderate success on the radio. Lloran Mis Mu\u00F1ecas (My Wrists Cry) was planned as a third single, but was canceled because it was a theme alluding to suicide. Several projects were cut short due to supposed illness of Andrade, among the highlights suspended plans to record a soap opera starring Gloria Trevi under the title of the Angels to be released in March 1996 by TV Azteca signal. The huge investment had been made Trevi and Andrade. On March 13, 1996, Trevi announced that she would retire from performing live due to her manager's cancer. She offered her last two concerts at the National Auditorium, 16 and 17 March. Trevi's claims about Andrade's cancer have never been verified, and it was later speculated by the press that he was never ill.

According to the contract, 6 years, Gloria is committed to make four telenovelas,six films and conduct a program in primetime, it would be his first project. On September 16, 1996, Trevi returned to the small screen as the star of television's highest-paid Mexican XETU Remix.

The band's former drummer, Bogs Jugo, still plays drums in the track, \"Set Me Apart,\" the band's last song with him. The carrier single of the album entitled \"Sala\" has reached the top spot in NU 107's Stairway to Seven daily countdown. Even before the release of the album, the song \"Set Me Apart\" also reached the number one spot in the program. The album cover was designed by Mia Singson and Dok Sergio. It also features photography from Francis Magalona. It was co-produced with The Mongols' Jerome \"J. Astro\" Velasco, who also played additional guitars on most of the tracks. Guitars for \"Bato\" was purely done by Velasco without Yuzon. The album was recorded and engineered in Soundsrite studio in Kalayaan Ave. in Makati City, owned by Boyet Aquino, the original drummer of Francis Magalona's band called Hardware Syndrome, where Wendell Garcia also sessions with. Aquino have also worked as a mixer and audio engineer with Luke Mejares, Freestyle, Gary Valenciano, Kuh Ledesma and many Filipino artists. He also composed some songs with Francis Magalona such as \"Spirit Warriors\" and \"Wala Ka!\" The album was mixed by Jack Rufo (of Neocolours) at his own studio called Jack's Tone, Quezon City. Patrick Tirano (Beautiful Machines' co-producer) mastered the album at Wombworks. Pre-production was done by MusashiBazooka (JP Cuison of Kiko Machine and Erl Directo) The song \"Matador\" was actually created alongside the song \"Set Me Apart.\" Both were submitted to Sony Pictures Entertainment as demos for Animax theme song. However, Sony chose \"Set Me Apart\" for Animax. The band later decided to re-record the song \"Matador\" and they included it in Wild Life album. Since \"Matador\" was then-intended for Sony, the phrase \"like no other\" can be heard from the song. Which is Sony's company slogan from 2004 to 2009. According to Buendia during the band's interview in Myx Live, it only took them 3 weeks in making the album. Track listing 1. Fin (D. Ventura)2. Matador (E. Buendia, D. Ventura)3. Monobloc (E.

	dbo:abstract	"Infallible is the 7th studio album released by Jamaican recording artist Tanya Stephens. This album was unique in the sense that it was a free download to all her fans. Tanya released the album for free stating \"Infallible by Tanya Stephens! Feel free to forward the link to as many people as you wish. The album is completely free of cost. Enjoy!!\" Andrew Henton, Tanya's life partner and co-founder of Tarantula Records stated the reason the album was a free download was because Tanya wanted to do something special for her fans, the major reason being that there\u2019s a recession going on, and things are already hard on everyone, he then stated that Tanya believes that when she gives an album to a major label (e.g. VP Records), technically she\u2019s giving it away for free anyway, so she would much rather give it directly to the fans. The website that originally hosted the album was BYM Riddim, although the website has since shut down making the album unavailable to download, although the album has been uploaded to other websites such as Mediafire & Rapidshare by fans making it easy enough to download. Tanya approves of this, as it was a free album, she merely wanted the album to reach her fans. The album was also given away as a hard copy with Jamaican based German magazine, 'Riddim' and can be backordered."@en ;

Despite the similarities, the band mentions in a press release: \"Airports have some of the glossiest surfaces in modern culture, but the fear underneath remains. Hence this record is not a utilitarian accompaniment to airports, in the sense of reinforcing the false utopia and fake idealism of air travel. Unlike Eno's Music for Airports, this is not a record to be used by airport authorities to lull their customers. ... While on tour, the Black Dog made 200 hours of field recordings, much of which was processed and combined with new music in the airport itself, waiting for the next flight. This vast amount of content has been slowly distilled into a set of particularly evocative pieces of music.\" The album was a collaborative project for art galleries soundtracked by The Black Dog, with visual media created by design studio Human."@en ;

It was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Original Song in early 1964, and Williams was asked and did appear to perform at the Oscar ceremony that April but not to sing that song. Instead he sang his number 100 hit from January, \"Charade\", as well as the song included in the title of his new album that was soon to be released, The Academy Award-Winning \"Call Me Irresponsible\" and Other Hit Songs from the Movies.

	dbo:abstract	"Michael Jackson's Vision is a deluxe DVD box set by American recording artist Michael Jackson. It was released on November 22, 2010 by Epic Records, Legacy Recordings, and Jackson's own label, MJJ Productions. It includes three DVDs, featuring 4.5 hours of content of 42 music videos with newly restored color and remastered audio. Jackson referred to each of these productions as a \"short film\" and not a music video. This is the first time that all of Jackson's videos have been released on DVD. According to a statement by the producers, the video recognizes Jackson's \"pioneering short films that transformed the entertainment industry with timeless, pop culture classics\". Disc one features videos from the albums Off the Wall, Thriller and Bad and disc two features videos from the albums Dangerous, HIStory: Past, Present and Future, Book I, Blood on the Dance Floor: HIStory in the Mix and Invincible. The third disc, which is a bonus disc, features seven videos. Michael Jackson's Vision includes the full-length versions of the John Landis-directed \"Thriller\" and \"Black or White\" as well as the classic \"Bad\" directed by Academy Award winning filmmaker Martin Scorsese. Also included in the boxed set are Jackson's collaborations with other noted film directors such as John Singleton, Spike Lee and David Fincher as well as \"Ghosts,\" his rarely seen collaboration with special effects legend Stan Winston. Michael Jackson's Vision is available in a limited edition boxed set featuring a 60-page glossy hard-bound book that includes behind-the-scenes photos from Jackson's videos, which includes information for each video including: songwriter, album, director, production date, location and photography. Ten music videos previously unavailable on DVD including \"One More Chance\" are included. It was also released on the iTunes Store and has iTunes LP features. The videos \"Smooth Criminal\", \"Speed Demon\", \"Come Together\", and \"Leave Me Alone\" come from Jackson's 1988 film Moonwalker. The \"Smooth Criminal\" segment is actually over 40 minutes long but only the 10-minute song and dance scene is featured. The video \"Another Part of Me\" is from Jackson's Bad World Tour and \"Will You Be There\" is from the Dangerous World Tour. The \"HIStory\" video is the only short film that is not included in this box set. The original music video of \"Blood on the Dance Floor\" is replaced with the Refugee Camp Mix for unknown reasons. The videos for The Jacksons' songs \"Torture\" and \"Body\" are also not included, because Michael did not appear in either of them, despite having a verse in each of them. Also not included is the music video for The Jacksons' \"2300 Jackson Street\". On February 15, 2011, Michael Jackson's Vision was certified 5\u00D7 Platinum by RIAA for the sales of over 0.5 million units in the United States. On December 31, 2010, it was also certified Diamond in France (for the sales of over 60 000 units) and 2\u00D7 Platinum in Australia. On May 29, 2011, it was also certified Gold in New Zealand. It has been also certified Gold in Austria and Platinum in Poland. Reception over the video and audio quality of the box set has been mixed. As the videos are played in 16:9, videos with a 4:3 aspect ratio are letterboxed and as a result the resolution is lower than some previous DVDs. Also, the audio is mixed in PCM stereo instead of 5.1 Surround as in many previous DVDs."@en ;

The album was produced by Ryan Hewitt, who has worked with bands Red Hot Chili Peppers and The Avett Brothers.

In a 2011 interview on BBC Radio 1, frontman Dave King explained that the title track and album title was taken from a quote of Dino Miseti\u0107, the artist who designed the album cover, which appeared in the book Sarajevo Marlboro. Dino, who grew up in the Balkans during the Balkan Wars, is quoted in the book, saying: \"They taught us what the speed of light is, but nobody can teach you what the speed of darkness is.\""@en ;

In an interview[citation needed] with the Pitchfork website, Lentini said: Sacred music is generally only referred to music based on religious texts. I think this is wrong. Any kind of music able to convey some Truth about existence should be regarded as \u201Csacred\u201D. It is neither a matter of sound nor of musical instrument. It is not a genre, but an attitude: whether it is symphonic or indie music, if there is some inner truth in it, a profound expressive intensity, then there\u2019s sacredness. Whatever is human is necessarily sacred, because humanity always deserves to be respected and honoured. Before being \u201Csacred\u201D for its text, my Stabat Mater is mundanely sacred for the emotions it hopefully arouses."@en ;

After publishing two unsuccessful works, her first EP, Kill Kill; and her first studio album, Lana Del Ray, the four-track EP was released in anticipation of Del Rey's major label debut Born to Die (2012). The tracks are influenced by several genres, including indie pop, hip hop, and alternative music. The lyrics and melody were written primarily by Del Rey, Patrik Berger, and Justin Parker. Production of the album was led by Emile Haynie, who also co-wrote \"Blue Jeans\". Contemporary critics gave mixed reviews of the EP. Music videos accompanied each single, which were produced by Del Rey herself and uploaded to YouTube. Although the video for \"Video Games\" that Del Rey filmed with her webcam was not intended as a single at the time, it garnered enough online buzz to be noticed by Stranger Records, opening the opportunity for Del Rey to sign a joint record deal with Interscope and Polydor, leading to the eventual publication of the EP and additional videos for \"Blue Jeans\" and \"Born to Die\". Selling over 24,000 copies in the United States, the EP peaked at number twenty on the Billboard 200, peaking at six on the Rock Albums chart and six on the Alternative Albums chart.

The 10-song album featured two songs from the single \"Hunting For Your Dream\": the titular song and \"Temptation Through the Night\", the latter which was featured as a \"work in progress\" version. The full album version of \"Angel of Salvation\" is Galneryus' longest song to date at 14 minutes and 42 seconds long; twice as long as the song's music video. The song is also the first to feature a guest vocalist in a studio album by Galneryus in Akane Liv from the band LIV MOON. For the album and tour, Syu switched from a Hughes and Kettner amplifier to a Diezel Hagen amplifier and cabinet. This was also shown in the \"Angel of Salvation\" music video. Syu reverted to his ESP Crying Star Rebel signature guitar for the \"Under the Promised Flag Tour\" with modifications to the humbuckers. \"Hunting for Your Dream\" was used as the second closing theme for the new Hunter \u00D7 Hunter anime adaptation."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Level3 (capitalized as LEVEL3) is the fourth studio album by Japanese girl group Perfume. It was released on October 2, 2013 by Universal J and Perfume Records. Level3 marks Perfumes fourth consecutive album to be fully produced by Japanese producer and Capsule member Yasutaka Nakata, while Perfume contributes to the album as the lead, background vocalists, and executive producers through their self-titled record label. Recorded in Japanese and English language, Level3 is an electronic dance album that borrows numerous musical elements including J-pop, house music, and technopop. Level3 was recorded and mixed in Japan, with the assistance of Nakata. Six different formats were released to promote the album; a standalone CD, a limited CD and DVD bundle, and a digital release. It was re-released in May 2014 as an additional bonus CD standalone edition, a 7 inch vinyl, and a digital release. Two different artworks were issued for the album's cover sleeve; one has Perfume inside the set of their music video \"1mm\", whilst the second features body shots of Perfume and printed on transparent sheets. Upon the album's release, it was met with favourable reviews from music critics. Critics noted the musical improvement from their previous release, and commended Nakata's production standards and its commercial appeal. Level3 was listed by several critics as one of the best albums of 2013. Commercially, Level3 was a success. It became Perfume's fourth studio album to reach the top spot on Japan's Oricon Albums Chart, and was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of Japan (RIAJ) for shipments of 250,000 units. The album charted on Korea's Gaon Album Chart and Taiwan's G-Music Albums Chart. Four singles were released from Level3, including one promotional. Its lead single \"Spring of Life\" reached number two on Japan's Oricon Singles Chart and atop the Japan Hot 100 chart. The second, third, and fourth singles; \"Spending All My Time\", \"Mirai no Museum\", and \"Magic of Love\" achieved similar success, put peaked at two on both record charts respectively. Each single was certified gold by the RIAJ company, Perfume's only album to achieve this. Promotional single \"1mm\" reached number nine on the Japan Hot 100 chart. Perfume promoted the album on their 2013 Dome Tour."@en ;

dbr:Preflyte	rdf:type	schema:MusicAlbum ;
	dbo:abstract	"Preflyte is a compilation album by the American folk rock band The Byrds and was released in July 1969 on Together Records (see 1969 in music). The album is a collection of demos recorded by The Byrds (then named The Jet Set) at World Pacific Studios in Los Angeles during 1964, before the band had signed to Columbia Records. As such, the music on the album predates the release of The Byrds' debut single for Columbia, a cover version of Bob Dylan's \"Mr. Tambourine Man\", which topped the charts in America and the United Kingdom during 1965. The album's title is a deliberate misspelling of \"pre-flight\", meant to emulate the misspelling of \"birds\" that the band had used for their name. Preflyte peaked at number 84 on the Billboard Top LPs chart upon its initial release and outsold The Byrds' most recent studio album, Dr. Byrds & Mr. Hyde. It was less successful in the United Kingdom, however, where it failed to enter the UK Albums Chart when it was issued there in 1973. The album was later reissued in America by Columbia Records and again charted, this time reaching number 183. The album is notable for including a number of previously unreleased songs that had not been recorded by The Byrds during their stint with Columbia Records. The album also includes early demo versions of the songs \"Here Without You\", \"You Won't Have to Cry\", \"I Knew I'd Want You\", and \"Mr. Tambourine Man\", all of which appeared in re-recorded form on the band's 1965 debut album. In 2001, Sundazed Records released an expanded, double CD compilation of tracks from the World Pacific era, titled The Preflyte Sessions. In 2012, Floating World Records reissued the Sundazed collection, with an additional eight bonus tracks, under the title Preflyte Plus. Tracks from The Byrds' World Pacific sessions were also repackaged on the In the Beginning album in 1988."@en ;

The album also includes collaborations with artists such as Stevie Wonder and John Legend. Upon its release, Young Foolish Happy was met with mixed reviews from music critics; while some reviewers found the album solid, others viewed it as formulaic and short of originality, and felt it lacks the \"charm\" of Lott's debut album, Turn It Up (2009). The album debuted at number eighteen on the UK Albums Chart with first-week sales of 18,503 copies, failing to match the commercial success of its predecessor. It spawned the UK number-one single \"All About Tonight\" and the top ten singles \"What Do You Take Me For?\" and \"Kiss the Stars\"."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Joi Bangla is an EP by Indian sitar virtuoso Ravi Shankar, issued in August 1971 on Apple Records. The recording was produced by George Harrison and its release marked the first in a series of occasional collaborations between the two musicians that lasted until the Chants of India album in 1997. Shankar recorded the EP in Los Angeles, to help raise international awareness of the plight faced by refugees of the Bangladesh Liberation War, in advance of his and Harrison's Concert for Bangladesh shows at Madison Square Garden, New York. Side one of the disc consists of two vocal compositions sung in Bengali, of which the title track was a message of unity to the newly independent nation, formerly known as East Pakistan. The third selection is a duet by Shankar and sarodya Ali Akbar Khan, supported by Alla Rakha on tabla, a performance that presaged their opening set at the Concert for Bangladesh. Joi Bangla was the first of four Shankar-related releases on the Beatles' Apple label, closely followed by the Raga soundtrack album. The EP has been out of print since soon after its release. Of the three tracks, only \"Oh Bhaugowan\" has been reissued \u2013 on the Harrison-compiled Ravi Shankar: In Celebration box set (1996)."@en ;

The album is their second released posthumously, after Leucocyte (album), as the pianist Esbj\u00F6rn Svensson died in June 2008. It was recorded during the same sessions of the recording of Leucocyte, whilst the Swedish trio were touring around Asia and Australia. The disc is named after Studios 301 in Sydney where the album was recorded. Before his death, Svensson was actually involved in the editing down of the sessions into what might have been a double album. In the end, surviving members Magnus \u00D6str\u00F6m and Dan Berglund elected to delay the release of 301.

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/37_Everywhere>	rdf:type	schema:MusicAlbum ;
	dbo:abstract	"37 Everywhere is Punchline's second full-length album on Fueled by Ramen Records. It reached a peak of #36 on the Billboard Heatseekers albums chart on April 29, 2006. It was produced by Shep Goodman and Kenny Gioia and continues to bring the brand of energetic pop punk that fans had come to expect from Punchline, yet often takes a turn towards alternative rock or unexpected styles. There is a much heavier use of falsetto on the album, by both Steve Soboslai (guitar) and Greg Wood (guitar), and somewhat less of Punchline's unconventional use of harmony, though the \"way they twist their voices mid-word, and adopt a unique sound\" remains at large. Subject matter tends to be less obviously positive than their previous album, following the departure of Paul Menotiades, but self-assured lyrics in songs such as \"Green Light\", \"They Are Strong Hands\" and \"Exactly\" are the antithesis to the dark and often violent lyrics of some of Punchline's peers. The album contains a number of references to Menotiades, although the band insists that the third track, \"The Getaway\", is not one of these. As lead vocalist and lyricist, Soboslai shares vocals with both Wood and Chris Fafalios (bass guitar) on 37 Everywhere. The name of the album comes from Soboslai and Fafalios's growing fascination with the number 37, and the liner notes advise that \"The number 37 is everywhere. It is in your daily routine and it will surprise you. Look for it and it will look for you.\" The album is dedicated to the life and times of John 'Beatz' Holohan (1974\u20132005) of the New York band Bayside, and the song \"They Are Strong Hands\" contains a shout out to the late drummer, \"Ain't nobody gonna bring me down, 'cause my boy John Beatz got my back.\" The title of the song is a reference to the track \"They Looked Like Strong Hands\" on Bayside's 2005 album Bayside, which features guest vocals from Punchline's Steve Soboslai. 37 Everywhere has guest vocals from Anthony Raneri, the lead vocalist of Bayside on \"Flashlight\", vocals from John Johansen of the defunct Stryder on \"Caller 10\", Ryan Mendez of Yellowcard and Staring Back playing guitar on the track \"Don't Try This at Home\", and Josh Bonner of the defunct Unsung Zeroes on \"Wars Will Always Happen\". Punchline headlined the \"37 Everywhere Tour\" in spring 2006 to promote the album, with label mates Cute Is What We Aim For and the bands Valencia, New Atlantic and The Audition as opening acts. The band made a video with the director Jonathan London (Houston Calls, Reggie and the Full Effect) for the song \"Don't Try This At Home\". The album art was designed by the artist Jason Sho Green and is commonly noted for its similarities to The Shins' album art for Chutes Too Narrow."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"A.K.A. (an acronym for Also Known As) is the eighth studio album by American entertainer Jennifer Lopez. It was released on June 13, 2014, by Capitol Records. Lopez started working on the album in February 2013, after the end of her first worldwide tour, the Dance Again World Tour. Originally scheduled to be released in November 2013, Lopez postponed the album release to 2014. Undecided between Same Girl and A.K.A. as the album's title, Lopez eventually chose the latter as the title. Initially, A.K.A. was to be executively produced by RedOne, with the producer claiming the album was going to mix many styles, having a blend of her previous musical background: urban pop, dance-pop and Latin. However, Cory Rooney and Benny Medina, her longtime collaborators, later became the album's executive producers, along with herself, bringing a more pop and R&B sound to the album. In early 2014, Lopez released two urban-infused tracks as the album's promotional singles: \"Girls\" and \"Same Girl\". Besides frequent contributor and personal friend Pitbull, the album also features collaborations with French Montana, T.I., Iggy Azalea, Rick Ross, Nas, Jack Mizrahi and Tyga. Upon its release, A.K.A. received generally mixed reviews from music critics, who spoke unfavorably of the album's mixed styles, although some songs were singled out for praise. Commercially, A.K.A. made minor impact on the charts, peaking outside the top-forty in Ireland and the United Kingdom, whilst elsewhere it became her lowest-charting studio album. A.K.A. was preceded by the release of two singles, \"I Luh Ya Papi\" and \"First Love\", which both experienced underwhelming performance on the charts."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"A New Day Has Come is the seventh English-language studio album by Canadian singer Celine Dion, released by Sony Music Entertainment on March 22, 2002. It was her first new studio album since 1997's Let's Talk About Love. Dion returned to the music scene after a two-year hiatus when she gave birth to her first child. She collaborated on A New Day Has Come with various producers, including Anders Bagge and Peer \u00C5str\u00F6m for the first time. Dion's long-time producer and friend, David Foster, did not appear on this album. A New Day Has Come garnered mostly positive reviews from the music critics, who noticed that Dion explores a \"broader, more adventurous\" range of pop music and \"dips its toe\" into modern music, particularly dance (\"Sorry for Love\"). However, the album also contains the usual adult contemporary songs, including power ballads like \"I Surrender\" and \"Have You Ever Been in Love,\" or the title track. Critics also praised \"Ten Days,\" \"Goodbye's (The Saddest Word),\" \"I'm Alive,\" \"When the Wrong One Loves You Right,\" \"The Greatest Reward,\" and two covers: \"Nature Boy\" and \"At Last.\" A New Day Has Come became a commercial success throughout the world and entered number one in more than seventeen countries. It has sold 3.3 million units in the United States and was certified three-times Platinum by the RIAA. In Canada, after shipping 600,000 copies, the album was certified six-times Platinum. The IFPI certified it three-times Platinum for selling three million units in Europe. Overall, A New Day Has Come has sold twelve million copies worldwide. The first single, \"A New Day Has Come\" was released in March 2002 and peaked inside the top ten in Canada and Europe. In the United States, it reached number twenty-two on the Billboard Hot 100 and broke the record for most weeks at number one on the Hot Adult Contemporary Tracks chart, staying on top for twenty-one weeks. The next single, \"I'm Alive\" was issued in August 2002 and also peaked inside the top ten in numerous European countries. The last commercial single, \"Goodbye's (The Saddest Word)\" was released in November 2002 and performed moderately on the charts, reaching the top forty in Europe."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"An American Prayer is the ninth and final studio album by The Doors. In 1978, seven years after lead singer Jim Morrison died and five years after the remaining members of the band broke up, Ray Manzarek, Robby Krieger, and John Densmore reunited and recorded backing tracks over Morrison's poetry (originally recorded in 1969 and 1970). Other pieces of music and spoken word recorded by the Doors and Morrison were also used in the audio collage, such as dialogue from Morrison's film HWY: An American Pastoral and snippets from jam sessions. The album received mixed reviews and still divides critics, yet it has managed a platinum certification in the US. When the album was originally released, longtime Doors' producer Paul Rothchild labeled the album a \"rape of Jim Morrison\". Rothchild claimed that he had heard all of the reels of master tapes from both the 1969 and the 1970 poetry sessions, insisting that the three remaining Doors failed to realize Morrison's original intent for an audio presentation of the poetry. Morrison himself, prior to leaving for Paris, had approached composer Lalo Schifrin as a possible contributor for the music tracks meant to accompany the poetry, with no participation from any of the other Doors members. In addition, he had developed some conception of the album cover art work by January 1971, and was in correspondence with artist T. E. Breitenbach to design this cover in the form of a triptych (a three-paneled painting with various images embedded in each panel)."@en ;

It was recorded at Konk Studio, in London, during sessions that lasted from January to March 1991, being mixed late that same year. The album was produced by Alan Wilder, engineered by Steve Lyon, and assisted by Dave Eringa. Bloodline was Alan Wilder's third Recoil release. After completing Depeche Mode's most successful album, Violator, and subsequent World Violation Tour (with Nitzer Ebb as the support act), Wilder co-produced Nitzer's 1991 album Ebbhead. This cemented both a good personal and working relationship with Nitzer lead singer Douglas McCarthy. After completing the Nitzer Ebb album, Wilder went to work on his solo project, and McCarthy returned the favor by performing on the Recoil album. Wilder recruited guest vocalists for the first time: Moby, Toni Halliday (from the band Curve), and Douglas McCarthy, helping produce a significant move forward. It also marked the first Recoil single, a cover of the Alex Harvey song \"Faith Healer\". The album is also notable for the track \"Electro Blues for Bukka White\", which introduced the idea of taking very old recordings and setting them in a new electronic setting. Moby, who contributed vocals for the song \"Curse\" under the name R.Hall, arguably used this inspiration for his breakthrough 1999 album, Play, for which he used several old field recordings by Alan Lomax, much as Wilder had used a 1937 recording of White's \"Shake 'Em on Down\"."@en ;

It is the third \"best-of\" collection after Yin and Yang (1995) and Kettle of Fish (1998), however, it covers Fish's entire solo career up to the previous year's studio album Field of Crows. The songs are divided into two sets: Disc 1, entitled \"Balladeer\", and disc 2, entitled \"Rocketeer\".It also features the single edits Marillion's three biggest hits, \"Kayleigh\", \"Lavender\" (1985) and \"Incommunicado\" (1987). (Unlike on Yin and Yang, these are the original versions rather than re-recordings.) It also features an edited version of \"Goldfish and Clowns\" from Sunsets on Empire (1997) which has never been released due to the planned single being ultimately cancelled. The only \"new\" track is Fish's version of the Scottish folk song \"Caledonia\", which had first been released on a 2002 tribute album to Frankie Miller, who had a Scottish number one with his own version in 1992. In total, the two discs contain 26 tracks (or 31, if the parts of the \"Plague of Ghosts\" suite are counted individually) with a total time of 143 minutes. Although not credited, the cover is a digitally edited design by Mark Wilkinson. It shows Fish sitting over a bowl of soup (presumably Bouillabaisse) in a restaurant whose walls are decorated with posters of Fish's previous album covers (an idea strikingly similar to Marillion's continental 2002 best-of album). The album marked the beginning of Fish's cooperation with the Snapper Music label, which took over the retail distribution of Fish's backcatalogue released on his own imprint Chocolate Frog Record Company. (Similarly, the previous best-of Kettle of Fish had been the first release on his short-lived connection with Roadrunner Records.)"@en ;

On the album, the group continued mixing live musicians with samples and hip hop lyrics. Whilst the album was not as well-accepted as the debut album Hand on the Torch, it represented a more mature approach to jazz-rap. After the huge success of their first album, the president of Blue Note records allowed the trio to dig deep into Blue Note's vault and do whatever they wanted to do with its material. The album's title comes from the street intersection in the middle of the theater district in New York City, which used to be the center of bebop in New York City."@en ;

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Changes_in_Latitudes,_Changes_in_Attitudes>	rdf:type	schema:MusicAlbum ;
	dbo:abstract	"Changes in Latitudes, Changes in Attitudes is the seventh studio album by American popular music singer-songwriter Jimmy Buffett. This is his breakthrough 1977 album, which remains the best-selling studio album of Buffett's career, and contains his biggest single, \"Margaritaville\". It was initially released in January 1977 as ABC AB-990 and later rereleased on its successor label, MCA. Changes was very popular and critically well received and was a transitional album on several levels for Buffett. In a commercial sense, it ushered in Buffett's greatest period of chart and airplay popularity - changing him from an FM cult favorite and minor hitmaker to a top-draw touring artist whose albums sold in the millions, receiving regular AM airplay at the time. Changes would be followed by equally popular and more grandiose expressions of Buffett's \"Caribbean Soul\" on Son of a Son of a Sailor (1978) and Volcano (1979). All of these albums would combine pop, bar-band rock, country, folk, and reggae influences with the professional production of Norbert Putnam. Changes also represented the beginning of the end of the \"Key West Albums\": the Don Gant-produced A White Sport Coat and a Pink Crustacean (1973), Living & Dying in 3/4 Time (1974), A1A (1974), and Hava\u00F1a Daydreamin' (1975). It is these four albums that capture the feel of early 1970s Key West, Florida and Buffett's experiences as a struggling musician and storyteller. Although the albums are not exclusively about Key West, they detail the laid back island ethos of the small island city and its pre-\"condo commando\" status as an American Casablanca ... a place where no one knows your name and would not care if they did. At the time, Key West was a derelict navy town looking for a direction and was filled with small bars and restaurants craving troubadours like Buffett, Steve Goodman, Jerry Jeff Walker, and others who would play for bar money. The albums document life in the Gulf of Mexico Region (\"Biloxi\", \"Banana Republics\", \"Woman Goin' Crazy on Caroline Street\", \"Wonder Why We Ever Go Home\") with displays of touring craziness (\"Miss You So Badly\"). After Changes, Buffett's scope grew to include the entire Caribbean and, later, the vast expanse of what would become \"world music.\" Buffett's Key West experiences would pepper his later work (even recording his albums in Key West's Shrimpboat Sound), but not like it did in the 1973-1977 period. It is this period, along with the 1978 and 1979 albums that created the mythos Jimmy Buffett has parlayed into icon status as a performer, restaurateur, entrepreneur, author, and celebrity."@en ;

dbr:Days_of_Purgatory	rdf:type	schema:MusicAlbum ;
	dbo:abstract	"Days of Purgatory is an American heavy metal album by Iced Earth. It is a collection of remixes and remakes from previous albums. Most of the songs from the Enter the Realm EP, Iced Earth, and Night of the Stormrider were re-sung by Matt Barlow, and on some of the songs the drums and bass were redone. The 2-cd version also has rough mixes of several songs from Burnt Offerings with the opening to the titular track re-recorded. The album cover features artwork of the Chaos Comics character Purgatori. The reason for the album was to improve the original songs, create nostalgia for older fans and introduce newer fans to Iced Earth's older work. The 2-CD limited edition was originally produced for European audiences but has since been released in the United States. Days of Purgatory was the last new release from the band featuring longtime guitarist Randall Shawver, and the first to feature bassist James MacDonough and drummer Brent Smedley. The song \"Written on the Walls\" from the band's self titled album was given completely new lyrics and renamed \"Cast in Stone\". The only songs left unrecorded from the band's first albums were \"Mystical End\", \"The Path I Choose\", and \"Curse the Sky\", though the latter two were both performed live with Barlow on vocals. \"Winter Nights\" was recorded during early sessions for Night of the Stormrider while Gene Adam was still on vocals, but this was the track which prompted Schaffer to ask Adam to get singing lessons, as it was felt he could not handle the high notes. Therefore, the song was not used on the album due to its acrimonious history, though it would have fit in with the storyline of the album. Live performances of this song from that era (such as Wuppertal '91) show him struggling to sing it, probably contributing to his dismissal. Schaffer eventually dug the song out of the vaults to use on this album with Barlow providing vocals, but, as mentioned in the album's booklet, used a 1986 Purgatory demo for the backing track instead."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Grind Finale is a two-CD compilation album covering Nasum's entire career, with songs from all the 15 studio recordings the band did between 1993 and 2004, including 21 previously-unreleased songs. The original title for the compilation was Blueprint for Extinction, but after the death of Nasum frontman Mieszko Talarczyk, the remaining band members felt that the word \"extinction\" made the title inappropriate. The band started to think of a play on words with \"Grind\" somewhere in the title, and ended up with \"Grind Finale\" since it would be the final major release from Nasum. The lyrics of the song \"Erased\" are almost entirely derived from a frequently quoted passage in Pierre-Joseph Proudhon's The General Idea of the Revolution in the Nineteenth Century.[citation needed]"@en ;

dbr:Heartbreak_Express	rdf:type	schema:MusicAlbum ;
	dbo:abstract	"Heartbreak Express is Dolly Parton's 24th solo studio album. Released in April 1982, the album returned Parton to a more fully realized country sound (a process she had begun on the previous year's 9 to 5 and Odd Jobs), after her late 1970s pop recordings. The album's first single, \"Single Women\", a slow-tempo honkytonk ballad about a singles bar, was written by Saturday Night Live writer Michael O'Donoghue, and had previously appeared in an SNL skit in late 1980. The single provided a top ten single for Parton. The title cut also was a top ten hit for her. \"Do I Ever Cross Your Mind\" (a song Parton had written in the early 1970s but had never officially recorded) appeared as a double-A-sided single (along with Parton's rerecording of \"I Will Always Love You\" from the Best Little Whorehouse in Texas Soundtrack), and reached #1 on the country charts in August 1982. \"Hollywood Potters\", Parton has explained to interviewers, came out of her experience filming the movie Nine to Five, as Parton watched many of the film's extras and bit players, who had worked very hard at acting through the years, but with very little success. The song, \"Do I Ever Cross Your Mind,\" was performed by American Idol (season 7) finalist Ramiele Malubay in 2008. She sang the song during the Dolly Parton tribute week. A studio version of her cover was released on the iTunes Store as \"Do I Ever Cross Your Mind (American Idol Studio Version) - Single\" in 2008. Heartbreak Express was re-released in digital format in 2013. The album is now out of print."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Home of the Brave was the fourth album release by Laurie Anderson, issued in 1986. Released by Warner Bros. Records, it was a partial soundtrack album of her concert film of the same name. Three of the eight tracks on the album were recorded in the studio and thus differ considerably from the filmed versions. A music video for \"Language is a Virus\" was produced, using the soundtrack studio recording but footage of the live performance. Two songs on the album were remakes of earlier works: \"Language Is a Virus\" was originally titled \"Language is a virus from outer space - William S. Burroughs\" and was performed on Anderson's earlier United States Live (the soundtrack album omits the song's spoken word introduction, \"Difficult Listening Hour,\" which had appeared on United States Live but which was also performed in the film). \"Sharkey's Night\" is a song from Anderson's previous album, Mister Heartbreak. However this rendition is performed by Anderson herself (the original was vocalized by William S. Burroughs) as it is in the film. Burroughs' voice is heard on the track \"Late Show,\" however. The soundtrack album omits the other live performances of songs from Mister Heartbreak that were featured in the movie. An alternate, faster-paced version of \"Smoke Rings\" was recorded for release as a possible single, but there is no indication it was ever issued; it can be heard during Anderson's made-for-TV short film What You Mean We?"@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Horror Show is the sixth studio album from the American heavy metal band Iced Earth, released June 26, 2001. It is a theme album based on classic monsters and horror-movie icons, including Dracula, Frankenstein, and the ghost from Phantom of the Opera. It was the first Iced Earth album to feature drummer Richard Christy, and the only album to feature Steve DiGiorgio on bass, though he did not tour with the band. Horror Show is usually considered Iced Earth's only straightforward power metal release, as little of the thrash metal influence from the band's earlier works is present. This album also featured more prominent usage of Matt Barlow's multi-layered vocals as a center point for the songs. There was a special limited-edition 2-CD set. The second CD featured the instrumental track \"Transylvania\" (an Iron Maiden cover) along with an interview with bandleader/rhythm guitarist Jon Schaffer. There is also a single-disc version with \"Transylvania\", but without the interview. The song \"Dracula\" includes the line \"the blood is the life\", a quote from Deuteronomy 12:23. However, it is likely lifted from the 1992 version of Bram Stoker's Dracula which also features the line. As in \"Dracula\", many of the lyrics are lifted straight from the movies they were inspired by. Unlike other releases, it features much writing from Matt Barlow. By the end of the song \"Damien\" there is a section where Jon's reversed voice repeats the message that is also in the middle, silent section of the song. So, if the song is played backwards, the true message can be heard. This kind of reversed voice was also done by Iron Maiden by the beginning of their song \"Still Life\" of their fourth studio album \"Piece of Mind\"."@en ;
