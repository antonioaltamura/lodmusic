Rosa originally garnered fame as a member of boy band Menudo in the 1980s, singing lead on the band's biggest stateside hit, \"Hold Me\" and featuring prominently in the accompanying music video. After leaving the band he moved to Brazil where he released two albums, achieving mainstream success. Afterwards he moved to California and formed the band Maggie's Dream, which split after only one album, allowing him to resume his solo career. The singer and composer has released numerous studio and experimental albums, and has composed multiple songs for Ednita Nazario, Julio Iglesias and former Menudo band-mate, Ricky Martin. He has also been featured on VH1's Behind the Music. Rosa has been highly influenced by the works of Bob Dylan, Miles Davis, Iggy Pop, Jimi Hendrix, Johnny Cash, Luis Alberto Spinetta, The Doors, Camar\u00F3n de la Isla, Horacio Quiroga, Caetano Veloso, Edgar Allan Poe and Glenn Danzig. In 1988, at age 18, he made his motion picture debut in the film Salsa, which was a big hit in Puerto Rico. During the filming of the movie, he met actress Angela Alvarado who would later become his wife. In 1996 he released the Latino alternative rock album Vagabundo produced by Phil Manzanera before helping launch Ricky Martin's musical career into a new global setting with Vuelve. Rosa wrote and produced various of Martin's hit singles including \"Mar\u00EDa\", \"La Vida Loca\", \"La Copa de La Vida\", \"She Bangs\" and \"Shake Your Bon-Bon\", among others. Rosa toured with Lenny Kravitz during the summer of 2004 to promote his concept album Mad Love. In April 2011, Rosa was diagnosed with a non-hodgkin lymphoma cancer near his liver. He underwent alternative and traditional treatment in Houston and Santa Monica. This kept Rosa in a hiatus for almost a year until his return in March 2012, when he started recording his latest album with Vida, and gave a concert with Juan Luis Guerra and Rub\u00E9n Blades at the Coliseo de Puerto Rico Jos\u00E9 Miguel Agrelot. In December 2012, he was declared cancer-free. On December 9, 2013, Rosa's manager confirmed his cancer had relapsed and overcame cancer once again after a second bone marrow transplant, but had to remain in quarantine for four additional months."@en ;

Thompson's musical style, characterized as honky tonk Western swing, was a mixture of fiddles, electric guitar and steel guitar that featured his distinctive, smooth baritone vocals. His backing band, The Brazos Valley Boys, was voted the top Country Western Band for 14 years in a row by Billboard. The primary difference between his music and that of Bob Wills was that Thompson, who used the swing beat and instrumentation to enhance his vocals, discouraged the intense instrumental soloing from his musicians that Wills encouraged; however, the \"Hank Thompson sound\" exceeded Bob Wills in Top 40 country hits. Although not as prominent on the top country charts in later decades, Thompson remained a recording artist and concert draw well into his 80s. The 1987 novel Crazy Heart by Thomas Cobb was inspired by Thompson's life, specifically by his practice of picking up a local band to back him when he toured. In 2009 Cobb's novel was turned into a successful film directed by Scott Cooper and starring Academy Award winner Jeff Bridges."@en ;

Moore had a genuine love for the traditional sounds of the church, but came to appreciate the uprising contemporary form of gospel music as well. He died in 2000, aged 44. In his earlier days, Moore received much of his tutelage and artistic craft by gospel music legends and personal friends such as the late Dr. Mattie Moss Clark, Rev. James Cleveland, and Richard \"Mr. Clean\" White, among many others. He also gave much acclaim to the Gospel Music Workshop of America (GMWA) for the molding of his gospel music career. After many chart-topping gospel hits and much noted success in the 1980s and early '90s, Moore soon became a household name among many gospel music listeners. In the mid-'90s Moore was diagnosed with colon cancer, and his health began to suffer. Shortly thereafter, he was diagnosed with diabetes, which left him bound to a wheelchair, blind and placed on dialysis. Determined to disallow any disease from hindering him to sing and minister, Moore continued singing, ministering, and recording. Moore's last recording, entitled \"Family and Friends, Live in Detroit\" was recorded in the summer of 1999 in his hometown of Detroit, with some of his dearest industry friends and gospel notables, such as Vanessa Bell Armstrong, Rudolph Stanfield, and Darius Twyman. The album was released in early 2000, shortly before his death at the age of 44."@en .

He is one of the three noted guitarists to have played with The Yardbirds (the other two being Eric Clapton and Jimmy Page). Beck also formed The Jeff Beck Group and Beck, Bogert & Appice. Much of Beck's recorded output has been instrumental, with a focus on innovative sound, and his releases have spanned genres ranging from blues rock, hard rock, jazz fusion, and an additional blend of guitar-rock and electronica. Although he recorded two hit albums (in 1975 and 1976) as a solo act, Beck has not established or maintained the sustained commercial success of many of his contemporaries and bandmates. Beck appears on albums by Mick Jagger, Tina Turner, Morrissey, Jon Bon Jovi, Malcolm McLaren, Kate Bush, Roger Waters, Donovan, Stevie Wonder, Les Paul, Zucchero, Cyndi Lauper, Brian May, Stanley Clarke, Screaming Lord Sutch and ZZ Top. He was ranked fifth in Rolling Stone's list of the \"100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time\" and the magazine, upon whose cover Beck has appeared three times, has described him as \"one of the most influential lead guitarists in rock\". He is often called a \"guitarist's guitarist\". Beck has earned wide critical praise and received the Grammy Award for Best Rock Instrumental Performance six times and Best Pop Instrumental Performance once. In 2014 he received the British Academy's Ivor Novello Award for Outstanding Contribution to British Music. Beck has been inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame twice: as a member of the Yardbirds (1992) and as a solo artist (2009)."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Jeffrey Scott \"Jeff\" Buckley (November 17, 1966 \u2013 May 29, 1997), raised as Scott \"Scottie\" Moorhead, was an American singer-songwriter and musician. After a decade as a session guitarist in Los Angeles, Buckley amassed a following in the early 1990s by playing cover songs at venues in Manhattan's East Village, such as Sin-\u00E9, gradually focusing more on his own material. After rebuffing much interest from record labels and his father Tim Buckley's manager Herb Cohen, he signed with Columbia, recruited a band, and recorded what would be his only studio album, Grace, in 1994. Rolling Stone considers him one of the greatest singers of all time. Over the following two years, the band toured widely to promote the album, including concerts in the U.S., Europe, Japan, and Australia. In 1996, they stopped touring and made sporadic attempts to record Buckley's second album in New York City with Tom Verlaine as producer. In 1997, Buckley moved to Memphis, Tennessee, to resume work on the album, to be titled My Sweetheart the Drunk, recording many four-track demos while also playing weekly solo shows at a local venue. On May 29, 1997, while awaiting the arrival of his band from New York, he drowned during a spontaneous evening swim, fully clothed, in the Mississippi River when he was caught in the wake of a passing boat; his body was found on June 4. Since his death, there have been many posthumous releases of his material, including a collection of four-track demos and studio recordings for his unfinished second album My Sweetheart the Drunk, expansions of Grace, and the Live at Sin-\u00E9 EP. Chart success also came posthumously: with his cover of Leonard Cohen's song \"Hallelujah\" he attained his first No. 1 on Billboard's Hot Digital Songs in March 2008 and reached No. 2 in the UK Singles Chart that December. Buckley and his work remain popular and are regularly featured in \"greatest\" lists in the music press."@en ;

He is best known as the former guitarist of the rock band Red Hot Chili Peppers, from 1988 until 1992, and again from 1998 until 2009. He recorded five studio albums with them. Frusciante has an active solo career, having released eleven solo albums and five EPs; his recordings include elements ranging from experimental rock and ambient music to new wave and electronica. In 2015, Frusciante released his debut acid house album under his alias, Trickfinger. He has also recorded with numerous other artists, including The Mars Volta, for whom he was a studio guitarist (and occasional live performer) from 2002 until 2008; Josh Klinghoffer and Joe Lally, with whom he released two albums as Ataxia; and various collaborations with both Klinghoffer and Omar Rodr\u00EDguez-L\u00F3pez. He has also produced and/or recorded with Duran Duran, Wu-Tang Clan, The Mars Volta and Omar Rodriguez Lopez, Swahili Blonde, Black Knights, The Bicycle Thief, Glenn Hughes, Ziggy Marley, Johnny Cash, George Clinton, and others. At the age of eighteen, he joined the Red Hot Chili Peppers, first appearing on the band's 1989 album, Mother's Milk. The group's follow-up album, Blood Sugar Sex Magik (1991), was a breakthrough success. Frusciante became overwhelmed by the band's new popularity and quit in 1992. He became a recluse and entered a long period of drug addiction, during which he released his first solo recordings: Niandra Lades and Usually Just a T-Shirt (1994) and Smile from the Streets You Hold (1997). In 1998, he successfully completed drug rehabilitation and rejoined the Red Hot Chili Peppers. Their next album, Californication (1999) would eventually go on to sell 16 million copies. His album To Record Only Water for Ten Days was made in 2001. A fourth album with the Chili Peppers, By the Way was released in 2002. On a creative spree, Frusciante released six solo albums in 2004; each album explored different recording techniques and genres. 2006 saw the release of his fifth and final album with the Chili Peppers, Stadium Arcadium. In 2009, Frusciante released The Empyrean, which features Flea and Josh Klinghoffer, and announced he had again parted ways with the Chili Peppers. Frusciante has received critical recognition for his guitar playing, ranking at number 18 on Rolling Stone's list of \"The 100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time\" in 2003; and again in a second list published in 2011, where he ranked at number 72. He was ranked as number 42 in Gibson's list of the \"50 Best Guitarists of All Time\". He was voted \"The Best Guitarist of the Last 30 Years\" in a 2010 BBC poll called \"The Axe Factor\". Frusciante was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of the Red Hot Chili Peppers on April 14, 2012 although he did not attend the ceremony."@en ;

He is also the founding lead vocalist and rhythm guitarist of the alternative rock band Jebediah, which was formed in 1994 and features his older brother Brett Mitchell, who joined on drums before the group's first performance. Jebediah released five studio albums between 1997 and 2011, the first three of which entered the top ten on the ARIA Albums Chart. Mitchell commenced performing as a folk pop artist under the name \"Bob Evans\" in 1999 to showcase \"quieter\" songs that were influenced by music that was different from the primary sound of Jebediah, and he deliberately chose a stage name that would distinguish him from his band. His most successful solo album Suburban Songbook, which was released on 10 June 2006, peaked at No. 15, and his next two solo albums Goodnight, Bull Creek! (3 April 2009) and Familiar Stranger (15 March 2013) reached the top 40. As of July 2016, Mitchell has released five Bob Evans studio albums."@en ;

In the film, McCoy performs the song \"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\", and provides guitar and vocals on others. McCoy goes by the stage name of \"Martin Luther\" in his music career. For his acting work he is credited under his full name. Martin Luther developed his mix of musical genres as a child where he was raised on choir hymns through his religious parents. At the same time, he learned how to play piano and was exposed to the sounds of Parliament Funkadelic.These eclectic tastes redirected Martin Luther's interests as he experimented with the sounds of funk. He taught himself how to play the drums and the piano, incorporating the wider range of instruments into his music. Martin Luther blends gospel with rock and R&B in his music with the release of his first solo album The Calling in 1999, and followed it with an independent release of his second album Rebel Soul Music in 2004 on his own label Rebel Soul Records; his third album \"Love is the Hero\" was released in 2012.

	dbo:abstract	"Anna Maria Quaini OMRI (born 25 March 1940), known as Mina Mazzini or simply Mina, is an Italian singer. She was a staple of television variety shows and a dominant figure in Italian pop music from the 1960s to mid-1970s, known for her three-octave vocal range, the agility of her soprano voice, and her image as an emancipated woman. In performance, Mina combined several modern styles with traditional Italian melodies and swing music, which made her the most versatile pop singer in Italian music. Mina dominated the country's charts for fifteen years and reached an unsurpassed level of popularity. She has scored 79 albums and 71 singles on the Italian charts. Mina's TV appearances in 1959 were the first for a female rock and roll singer in Italy. Her loud syncopated singing earned her the nickname Queen of Screamers. The public also labeled her the Tiger of Cremona for her wild gestures and body shakes. When she turned to light pop tunes, Mina's chart-toppers in West Germany in 1962 and Japan in 1964 earned her the title of the best international artist in these countries. Mina's more refined sensual manner was introduced in 1960 with Gino Paoli's ballad \"This World We Love In\", which charted on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1961. Mina was banned from TV and radio in 1963 because her pregnancy and relationship with a married actor did not accord with the dominant Catholic and bourgeois morals. After the ban, the public broadcasting service RAI tried to continue to prohibit her songs, which were forthright in dealing with subjects such as religion, smoking and sex. Mina's cool act combined sex appeal with public smoking, dyed blonde hair, and shaved eyebrows to create a \"bad girl\" image. Mina's voice has distinctive timbre and great power. Her main themes are anguished love stories performed in high dramatic tones. The singer combined classic Italian pop with elements of blues, R&B and soul music during the late 1960s, especially when she worked in collaboration with the singer-songwriter Lucio Battisti. Top Italian songwriters created material with large vocal ranges and unusual chord progressions to showcase her singing skills, particularly \"Brava\" by Bruno Canfora (1965) and the pseudo-serial \"Se telefonando\" by Ennio Morricone (1966). The latter song was covered by several performers abroad. Shirley Bassey carried Mina's ballad \"Grande grande grande\" to charts in the U.S., U.K., and other English-speaking countries in 1973. Mina's easy listening duet \"Parole parole\" was turned into a worldwide hit by Dalida and Alain Delon in 1974. Mina gave up public appearances in 1978 but has continued to release popular albums on a yearly basis to the present day."@en ;

Following several collaborations and guest appearances, she launched her solo career in 1997 with her debut album Supa Dupa Fly, which spawned the hit singles \"The Rain (Supa Dupa Fly)\" and \"Sock It 2 Me\". The album debuted at number three on the Billboard 200, the highest-charting debut for a female rapper at the time. Elliott's following album Da Real World (1999), produced the singles \"She's a Bitch\", \"All n My Grill\", and top five hit \"Hot Boyz\". With the release of Miss E... So Addictive (2001), Under Construction (2002), and This Is Not a Test!

	dbo:abstract	"Patrick Martin Stumph (born April 27, 1984), known professionally as Patrick Vaughn Stump, is an American musician, singer-songwriter, record producer, actor and music critic, best known as the lead vocalist, guitarist, pianist and composer for the rock band Fall Out Boy, originally from Wilmette, Illinois. He also embarked on a solo career as a side project from Fall Out Boy during its hiatus. He has been credited for being a soulful vocalist suitable for R&B, as well as one of the best voices in pop punk, according to Billboard. With Fall Out Boy he placed singles in the top 10 of the US Billboard Hot 100 and their 2007 album Infinity on High was their first to reach No. 1 on the Billboard 200, with two more hitting the top spot in 2013 and 2015. The band has toured extensively, having performed over 1,300 shows since their inception in 2001. Stump has collaborated with an extensive list of artists and has produced albums for other artists including Cobra Starship and Gym Class Heroes. After Fall Out Boy's hiatus in late 2009, Stump released his debut solo album, Soul Punk, on October 18, 2011; on which he wrote all the songs, played all the instruments, as well as handling production and self-funding it. It served as an outlet for the music that he could not make with Fall Out Boy. A remix of \"This City\" was released as the first single to iTunes and a music video has been created, featuring Lupe Fiasco. He released his debut six-song EP titled Truant Wave on February 22, 2011. His solo work is a major musical departure from the pop punk sound of Fall Out Boy. The influence of Michael Jackson and Prince, among many other artists, is evident through his soulful electronic sound, which he calls \"soul punk\". He has toured in the US and played some dates in Europe in support of Soul Punk and Truant Wave, and opened for Panic! at the Disco on their month-long US fall tour which began on October 9, 2011. On February 4, 2013, Fall Out Boy announced a comeback with the single \"My Songs Know What You Did in the Dark (Light Em Up)\", later certified 5x platinum, the album Save Rock and Roll, which debuted at No.1 on the Billboard 200 chart, and a subsequent tour. The EP PAX AM Days was later released on October 15, 2013. Stump's vocals for sixth album American Beauty/American Psycho, which was released January 20, 2016, and debuted at No.1, were heavily praised. Later in 2015 a rap remix of the album was made as \"Make America Psycho Again\"."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Alecia Beth Moore (born September 8, 1979), known professionally as Pink (frequently stylized as P!nk), is an American singer, songwriter, dancer, and actress. She was signed to her first record label with original R&B girl group Choice in 1995. The label saw potential in only Pink, offering her a solo deal. Choice disbanded in 1998. Pink rose as an artist with her debut solo album, Can't Take Me Home (2000). It was certified double-platinum in the United States and spawned two Billboard Hot 100 top-ten hits: \"There You Go\" and \"Most Girls\". She gained further recognition with the Moulin Rouge! soundtrack \"Lady Marmalade\", which gave Pink her first Grammy Award as well as her first number-one single on the Billboard Hot 100. Pink took control in early 2001 insisting she wanted to work with her childhood hero, Linda Perry. Pink took more artistic control and pursued pop rock direction for her second album, Missundaztood (2001). It sold more than 15 million copies worldwide and yielded three United States top-ten singles, \"Get the Party Started\", \"Don't Let Me Get Me\", and \"Just Like a Pill\". Pink's third studio album, Try This (2003), generated considerably lower sales, but earned her the Grammy Award for Best Female Rock Vocal Performance. Pink revived her popularity with her fourth and fifth studio albums, I'm Not Dead (2006) and Funhouse (2008), with the latter containing her second United States number-one hit, \"So What\". Pink concluded the first decade of her career with the compilation album Greatest Hits... So Far!! (2010), which featured \"Fuckin' Perfect\" and the chart-topping single \"Raise Your Glass\". Her sixth studio album, The Truth About Love (2012), debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 and spawned the top-ten singles \"Blow Me (One Last Kiss)\", \"Try\", and \"Just Give Me a Reason\", with the latter becoming her fourth United States number-one single. In 2014 Pink recorded a collaborative album, Rose Ave., with Canadian musician Dallas Green under a folk music duo named You+Me. Noted for having \"a strong signature voice and a literally acrobatic ability on stage\", Pink has received mostly positive reception from music critics. She has sold over 190 million records worldwide. She has sold over 16 million albums in the United States. Her career accolades include three Grammy Awards, a Brit Award, a Daytime Emmy Award and six MTV Video Music Awards. In 2009, Billboard recognized Pink as the Pop Songs Artist of the Decade. Pink was also the second most-played female solo artist in the United Kingdom during the 2000s decade, behind Madonna. VH1 ranked her number 10 on their list of the 100 Greatest Women in Music, while Billboard awarded her the Woman of the Year award in 2013. At the 63rd annual BMI Pop Awards, she received the BMI President's Award for \"her outstanding achievement in songwriting and global impact on pop culture and the entertainment industry.\""@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Damon Albarn, OBE (/\u02C8de\u026Am\u0259n \u02C8\u00E6lb\u0251\u02D0rn/; born 23 March 1968) is an English musician, singer-songwriter, multi-instrumentalist and record producer. He is the lead singer of the alternative rock band Blur as well as co-founder, vocalist, instrumentalist and principal songwriter of the virtual band Gorillaz. Raised in Leytonstone, East London and around Colchester, Essex, Albarn attended the Stanway School, where he met Graham Coxon and eventually formed Blur, whose debut album Leisure was released in 1991 to mixed reviews. After spending long periods of time touring the United States, Albarn's songwriting became increasingly influenced by British bands from the 1960s. The result of these influences came in the form of Modern Life Is Rubbish (1993), Parklife (1994) and The Great Escape (1995). All three albums received widespread critical acclaim while Blur gained mass popularity in the UK, aided by a rivalry shared with Oasis. Subsequent albums such as Blur (1997), 13 (1999), Think Tank (2003) and The Magic Whip (2015) contained influences from lo-fi, electronic and hip hop music. Albarn was voted the fourth-greatest frontman of all time in a 2010 UK poll for Q music magazine. Along with Tank Girl creator Jamie Hewlett, Albarn formed the \"virtual band\" Gorillaz in 1998. Drawing influences from alternative rock, trip hop, hip hop, electronica, dub, reggae and pop music, the band released their self-titled debut album in 2001; it was hugely successful worldwide. Although Albarn is the only permanent musical contributor, the albums feature many collaborations from a wide range of artists. Gorillaz are cited by the Guinness Book of World Records as the \"Most Successful Virtual Band\". Other projects include working with African musicians in aid of the charity Oxfam, writing and performing lead vocals on The Good, the Bad & the Queen as part of an unnamed supergroup featuring Tony Allen, Paul Simonon and Simon Tong and composing film soundtracks. He has also ventured into the world of opera with Dr Dee and Monkey: Journey to the West. He is also a Chelsea F.C. fan and frequently attends their games at Stamford Bridge. Albarn's debut solo studio album Everyday Robots\u2014co-produced by XL Recordings CEO Richard Russell\u2014was released on 28 April 2014 and featured collaborations with Brian Eno, Natasha Khan and the Leytonstone City Pentecostal Mission Church Choir as well as sampling several rants by Lord Buckley. He was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 2016 New Year Honours for services to music."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Paul Samuel Whiteman (March 28, 1890 \u2013 December 29, 1967) was an American bandleader, composer, orchestral director and violinist. Leader of one of the most popular dance bands in the United States during the 1920s and 1930s, Whiteman produced recordings that were immensely successful, and press notices often referred to him as the \"King of Jazz\". Using a large ensemble and exploring many styles of music, Whiteman is perhaps best known for his blending of symphonic music and jazz, as typified by his 1924 commissioning and debut of George Gershwin's jazz-influenced \"Rhapsody in Blue\". Later, Whiteman's work on Symphonic Jazz influenced many jazz musicians - directly or indirectly - as diverse as Miles Davis, Gil Evans, the Modern Jazz Quartet, Wynton Marsalis and other modern artists. Whiteman recorded many jazz and pop standards during his career, including \"Wang Wang Blues\", \"Mississippi Mud\", \"Rhapsody in Blue\", \"Wonderful One\", \"Hot Lips (He's Got Hot Lips When He Plays Jazz)\", \"Mississippi Suite\", \"Grand Canyon Suite\", and \"Trav'lin' Light\". He also co-wrote the 1925 jazz classic \"Flamin' Mamie\". His popularity faded in the swing music era of the middle 1930s, and by the 1940s Whiteman was semi-retired from music. But he experienced a revival and had a comeback in the 1950s with his own network television series on ABC, Paul Whiteman's Goodyear Revue, which ran for three seasons. He also hosted the 1954 ABC talent contest show On the Boardwalk with Paul Whiteman. Whiteman's place in the history of early jazz is somewhat controversial. Detractors suggest that Whiteman's ornately-orchestrated music was jazz in name only (lacking the genre's improvisational and emotional depth), and co-opted the innovations of black musicians. Defenders note that Whiteman's fondness for jazz was genuine (he worked with black musicians as much as was feasible during an era of racial segregation), that his bands included many of the era's most esteemed white jazz musicians, and argue that Whiteman's groups handled jazz admirably as part of a larger repertoire. In his autobiography, Duke Ellington declared, \"Paul Whiteman was known as the King of Jazz, and no one as yet has come near carrying that title with more certainty and dignity.\" It's also likely that the term \"jazz\" was most loosely defined in the 1920s and probably included syncopation with some improvisation, as well as the more pure (often) African-American New Orleans, Harlem or Chicago style. Whiteman's crowning of the term \"King of Jazz\" was likely not meant to take anything away from the performers of the more pure jazz style."@en ;

He is best remembered as their drummer and as the middle brother of bandmates Brian and Carl Wilson. Dennis was the only true surfer in the Beach Boys, and his personal life exemplified the \"California Myth\" that the band's early songs often celebrated. He was also known for his brief association with then-aspiring songwriter Charles Manson, who was later convicted of murder conspiracy. Dennis served mainly on drums and backing vocals for the Beach Boys from its formation until his death in 1983. While he was allowed few lead vocals in the 1960s, his prominence as a singer-songwriter increased into the 1970s. His original songs for the group included \"Little Bird\" (1968), \"Forever\" (1970), and \"Slip On Through\" (1970). Although uncredited, he also helped pen \"You Are So Beautiful\", a hit for Joe Cocker in 1974. His only solo album, Pacific Ocean Blue (1977), was released to warm reviews, but a moderate commercial reception. Written and recorded over a span of several years, the album peaked on US record charts at number 96 during a 12-week stay. Sessions for a follow-up, , disintegrated before Wilson's death. In 1988, Dennis was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame posthumously as a member of the Beach Boys. Author Tony Sclafani summarized Dennis' legacy: \"By all appearances the happy-go-lucky Beach Boy, Dennis Wilson lived out the proverbial live-fast-die-young motto. ... His wild side masked an underside that was, by turns, brooding, self-loathing, sensitive, and anxious. Dennis\u2019s music reflected his edginess and exhibited little of his happy charm, setting it apart from Brian\u2019s music. Dennis never sang about fun, and no images of surfboards or surfer girls ever appear in a Dennis Wilson song.\""@en ;
