	dbo:abstract	"Long Distance is the third studio album by American band Ivy. It was released on November 8, 2000 in Japan, while the US version was released on July 10, 2001 by Nettwerk. Noted as a departure from Ivy's previous studio album Apartment Life (1997), the album took influence from new wave music, as well as from indie pop and indie rock, a style that Ivy is known for. Ivy collaborated with long-time producer Peter Nashel for part of the album, while the rest was completely produced and written by members Andy Chase and Adam Schlesinger. Long Distance received positive reviews upon release, and is noted for its different sound compared to Ivy's previous works, Apartment Life and Realistic. Many critics favored Ivy's new approach, although some found it less interesting compared to the material on Apartment Life. Commercially, the album fared well in both Japan and the United States, but did not peak on any significant record chart. Four singles were released from the album. \"Lucy Doesn't Love You\", \"Disappointed\" and \"I Think of You\" were all commercially unsuccessful, while the album's third single, \"Edge of the Ocean\", appeared in numerous films and television programs. Promotional singles \"Undertow\" and \"Worry About You\" also were used heavily in the media, and the latter was used as the theme song for the ABC miniseries Kingdom Hospital. Promotional music videos were created for both \"Lucy Doesn't Love You\" and \"Edge of the Ocean\"."@en ;

However, the band and the label decided that it did not fit with their vision, so it was re-recorded \"live in the studio\" direct to two-track, with the exception of \"Love Whip.\" The phrase \"Smoke 'em if You Got 'em\" or \"Smoke if You Got 'em\" predates this album and is slang for \"do what you want, if you have the means.\" The first phrase was popular during WWII meaning to take a break. Officers would say \"Smoke 'em if you got 'em\" allowing the soldiers to take a break and smoke their cigarettes. [Vic Morrow - Combat!

Commonly regarded as one of his most significant works, Station to Station was the vehicle for his last great \"character\", the Thin White Duke. The album was recorded after he completed shooting Nicolas Roeg's The Man Who Fell to Earth, and the cover artwork featured a still from the movie. During the sessions Bowie was heavily dependent on drugs, especially cocaine, and later claimed that he recalled almost nothing of the production. Musically, Station to Station was a transitional album for Bowie, developing the funk and soul music of his previous release, Young Americans, while presenting a new direction towards synthesisers and motorik rhythms that was influenced by German electronic bands such as Neu! and Kraftwerk. This trend culminated in some of his most acclaimed work, the so-called \"Berlin Trilogy\", recorded with Brian Eno in 1977\u201379. Bowie himself said that Station to Station was \"a plea to come back to Europe for me\". The album's lyrics reflected his preoccupations with Nietzsche, Aleister Crowley, mythology and religion. Blending funk and krautrock, romantic balladry and occultism, Station to Station has been described as \"simultaneously one of Bowie's most accessible albums and his most impenetrable\". Preceded by the single \"Golden Years\", it made the top five in both the UK and US charts. In 2003, the album was ranked No. 323 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Strangers in the Night is a 1966 studio album by Frank Sinatra. It marked Sinatra's return to #1 on the pop album charts in the mid-1960s, and consolidated the comeback he started in 1966. Combining pop hits with show tunes and standards, the album creates a balance between big band and pop instrumentation. The single \"Strangers in the Night\" also reached #1 on the pop single charts, while \"Summer Wind\" would slowly become a classic, used for television commercials and mood-setting entrances by the 2000s. At the Grammy Awards of 1967 Sinatra garnered two Grammys for his efforts on this album, including the Record of the Year for the title track, as well as Best Male Vocal Performance for the same song. (He also won a further Grammy that same year, the Album of the Year for A Man and His Music). Ernie Freeman's arrangement of the title track won him the Grammy Award for Best Arrangement Accompanying a Vocalist or Instrumentalist. This is the final album Sinatra performed with long-time arranger/conductor Nelson Riddle and his orchestra. Strangers in the Night has been certified platinum for one million copies sold in the US. Aside from his Christmas output, it remains Sinatra's only solo studio album to achieve this certification to date. Also, this album has been reissued as a \"Deluxe Edition\" on January 26, 2010. Including three bonus tracks (two recorded tracks of \"Strangers in the Night\" and \"All or Nothing at All\" performed at the Budokan Hall from 1985, and an alternate take of \"Yes Sir, That's My Baby\").

After being cast in the reality television series The Hills and subsequently achieving public notability, she entered the music industry and began recording the project in 2007. However, it suffered from several setbacks after recorded material intended for the project was leaked and proved unsuccessful. Montag enlisted collaborators Steve Morales, Chris Rojas, The Runners, Sebastian Jacome, Fingazz during its production. Superficial received mixed-to-negative reviews from music critics. It debuted at number 41 on the U.S. Billboard Heatseekers Albums Chart with first-week sales of approximately 1,000 copies. Consequently, the record did not earn back the $2 million that Montag spent during its production; she later blamed its failure on inadequate promotional efforts. \"Superficial\" was released as the only single from the record on November 22, 2009; its accompanying music video was premiered in April 2010.

The Album had 3 Singles Released although none of them have received a music video. For the first time, Michael Cretu did not work as a producer for the album, as he was reportedly busy producing his new Enigma album A posteriori. Sandra's management first tried to find producers from the United Kingdom, but Sandra didn't like the idea of leaving her family for a long period of time. Finally, Sandra contacted Michael Cretu's \"right hand\", Jens Gad, who produced the entire album. Sandra, for the first time during her career, now participated actively in composing and writing the album. Therefore, the lyrics of the songs are more personal, with Sandra revisiting her childhood and all her sad experiences in them. She worked at Gad's studio at nights, returning home to prepare breakfast for her twins, and then sleeping until they would come home from school. Also, for the first time, Sandra revealed her new, sexier look in the promotional pictures shot in New York by B\u00E4rbel Miebach. The track \"Casino Royale\" is an alternative version of a song originally recorded by Polish singer Edyta G\u00F3rniak, as \"Sleep With Me\", and later covered by Canadian electronic music outfit Conjure One. Sandra's own alternative version, titled \"Sleep\", appears as a bonus track on the CD single release of \"The Way I Am\".

Several food-related songs that Yankovic had recorded, such as \"Girls Just Want to Have Lunch\" and \"Waffle King\" were left off the record, although the former was due to personal preference, while the latter was due to scheduling issues.

The album is a collection of tunes recorded in Longstreth's bedroom on a 4-track machine and in his brother's basement on a computer. Dave Longstreth plays everything on the album save for some back-up vocals on two tracks, which were sung by his brother Jake and a person only identified as Steve in the liner notes. Musically, the songs range from straightforward acoustic tunes, to hard rock songs and experimental instrumentals. A small discrepancy in the title of the album exists, since the graceful-fallen mango is written on one side of the CD's spine and THE GRACEFUL FALLEN MANGO is written on the other. Western Vinyl shows the title as the latter, following normal capitalization rules."@en ;

It was originally set to be titled All My Rowdy Friends Are Still Intoxicated or We're Not Fat, We Just Have Small Heads. This album's first single to be released was \"High School Never Ends\", which is available on iTunes. The album got an Honorable Mention on Ultimate-Guitar's top ten albums of 2006, and debuted at No. 88 on the Billboard Top 200. The album's title originated from the news ticker on the bottom of a TV screen that the group saw when in a hotel bar. The headline said \"Burrito Extortion Case,\" which intrigued the band members. According to the band on their official website \"there are at least 12 verses' worth of total joy for every sort-of-sad chorus about an ex-girlfriend on this record.\" This album is one of the Bowling For Soup albums not to feature a version of the song \"Belgium\"."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"The Time of Our Lives is the first extended play (EP) by American recording artist Miley Cyrus. The EP was released on August 28, 2009 by Hollywood Records, initially as a United States' Walmart exclusive. With alterations in artwork and track listing, an international edition was issued October 16, 2009. The Time of Our Lives was conceived as a release to accompany Cyrus' newly launched apparel line with Max Azria. The tracks on the EP were primarily composed by John Shanks and Dr. Luke, who also produced their respective cuts. Cyrus co-wrote one out of seven songs on The Time of Our Lives; one is a cover and another is a live rendition. Musically, the uptempo tracks on the record are in the pop rock and dance-pop genres while ballads are largely soft rock. Lyrically, it explores the themes of romantic relationships, among other subjects. The Time of Our Lives received generally positive reactions from critics, with some reviews suggesting that the EP was an effective step into adulthood for Cyrus. Some reviews were critical of the ballads which appear on the record, however. The EP was a commercial success, charting within the top ten in nine countries. In the United States, The Time of Our Lives peaked at number two on the Billboard 200 and was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) selling over 1.5 million copies. Moreover, the EP had success internationally, peaking at number three in Greece, number five in Austria, and number six in Spain. Two singles were released from The Time of Our Lives. The lead single, \"Party in the U.S.A.\", became Cyrus' best-selling effort up to that point, peaking at number two in the Billboard Hot 100. It also became one of the best-selling singles in the United States and Hollywood Records' best- and fastest-selling single. The second and final single released from the EP was \"When I Look at You\". It was used to promote the 2010 film The Last Song, which Cyrus starred in. Unable to match \"Party in the U.S.A.\"'s success, the single appeared in the top twenty of charts in Australia and the United States. Cyrus performed songs from The Time of Our Lives live numerous times. Her performance at the 2009 Teen Choice Awards caused a media uproar because of its sexuality. She embarked on her first world tour, the Wonder World Tour, to promote the EP in late 2009. The album has sold over 2 million copies worldwide."@en ;

Thematically, Truelove's Gutter is Richard's darkest album to date. Richard told the BBC that the album was inspired by particularly dark periods in his life and those of others.

After releasing lukewarm-received comeback album Destiny (2007) and their performance at the ESC 2008, the band collaborated with a range of American and Canadian producers and songwriters on the album. Pursuing a new musical direction, Welcome to the Dance took the group's work further into the dance and electronic genre, introducing a more international sound. However, upon release, the album received generally negative reviews by critics, who criticized the band for their missing individuality. Commercially, the album underperformed, becoming the group's lowest-charting and -selling effort to date. In Germany, it debuted and peaked at number twenty-six, becoming the band's first regular album neither to reach the top ten nor the top twenty.

	dbo:abstract	"Wings of Love is a 1976 album by The Temptations for the Gordy (Motown) label. The album was an unsuccessful release, both commercially and critically. Wings of Love's only single, \"Up the Creek (Without a Paddle)\" was co-written by Sly Stone, the inspiration for many of the Temptations' late 1960s/early 1970s \"psychedelic soul\" records; because of tax reasons, he could not take a publishing credit on the song. Stone and other members of the Family Stone appear on \"Up the Creek\", as well as \"Sweet Gypsy Jane\" and \"China Doll\" Producer Jeffrey Bowen preferred Dennis Edwards to the rest of the group, and wanted to produce an Edwards solo album instead of a group album. As a result, Bowen de-emphasized the rest of the group's vocals and placed them at levels far below Edwards' leads, prompting his dismissal as the Temptations' producer after this album's release. Unsurprisingly, Edwards sings lead on all but one of the songs on the album, leaving \"China Doll\" in the capable hands of Richard Street. The upshot of Bowen's obsession with Edwards is that fans will enjoy hearing Edwards exercise a greater vocal range than normal, particularly on the album's ballad-heavy second side. It at least received praise for being one of the most beautiful album covers in the group's discography. It returned to an old Motown marketing device of using abstract art to detract from the artists."@en ;

The compilation features songs from the first three Skid Row studio albums Skid Row, Slave to the Grind and Subhuman Race. The tracks \"Into Another\", \"My Enemy\" and \"Breakin' Down\" were remixed for this album with more tender, slightly cleaner mixes, presumably so they fit more suitingly with the other tracks.

The album presents a turning point in the career of Ice-T, who co-wrote the album's songs with lead guitarist Ernie C and performed as the band's lead singer. Previously known only as a rapper, Ice-T's work with the band helped establish a crossover audience with rock music fans. The album produced one single, \"There Goes the Neighborhood\". Body Count is well known for the inclusion of the controversial song \"Cop Killer\", which was the subject of much criticism from various political figures, although many defended the song on the basis of the group's right to freedom of speech. Ice-T eventually chose to remove the song from the album, although it continues to be performed live. It was voted the 31st best album of the year in The Village Voice's Pazz & Jop critics poll, and is believed to have helped pave the way for the mainstream success of the rap metal genre, although the album itself does not feature rapping in any of its songs."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Detonator is the fifth studio album by American glam metal band Ratt, released in August 1990. Though their previous album Reach for the Sky went platinum, it met with some criticism regarding the quality of their songs. In an attempt to regain the popularity that Ratt had in the mid-1980s, the band parted ways with long-time producer Beau Hill. Hitmaker Desmond Child and his personal sound engineer Sir Arthur Payson were hired to helm the project. The album is notable for featuring Ratt's only ballad, \"Givin' Yourself Away\". The band also gravitated towards a more glam metal/pop metal sound on Detonator. This is the last Ratt album to feature guitarist Robbin Crosby and bassist Juan Croucier. Crosby departed the group in 1991 following the Japanese leg of the Detonator Tour, and died in 2002 following a heroin overdose."@en ;

The latter is a singer-songwriter in his own right and has contributed distinctive backing vocals to a handful of Bad Seeds songs; here he and Cave deliver a rousing duet in the chorus of 'When I First Came to Town'.

	dbo:abstract	"Jesus Christ Superstar or Jesus Christ Superstar \u2013 Original Australian Cast Recording is an album released in late 1972 on MCA Records. Jesus Christ Superstar is a rock opera created by Tim Rice and Andrew Lloyd Webber in 1970. The earliest Australian version was staged from May 1972 to February 1974. This album features Trevor White (as Jesus), Jon English (as Judas) and Michele Fawdon (as Mary Magdalene). Together with other cast members they performed vocals for a studio recording. It was produced by Patrick Flynn, the show's musical director and a conductor for Opera Australia. The album peaked at No. 17 on the Go-Set Albums Chart in June 1973, while it reached No. 13 on the Kent Music Report and remained on its charts for 54 weeks. It appeared in the top 100 on the 1974 End of Year Albums Chart. In May 1973, the album was awarded a gold record for sales worth $50,000. This stage production and resultant album featured a number of notable Australian musicians. Jon English became a popular entertainer both as an actor and singer. Fellow cast members, Mike Wade on guitar and Greg Henson on drums, were part of English's backing band. Stevie Wright (as Simon Zealotes) was a former member of The Easybeats and he formed a band, Black Tank, with fellow cast members Rory O'Donoghue (as Peter) on guitar and vocals and Ken Firth on bass guitar. Wright then pursued a successful solo career. O'Donoghe was also a TV personality (Thin Arthur) on Australian TV series, The Aunty Jack Show, and its spin-off, Wollongong the Brave. Firth and other musicians for the stage version, Phil Eizenberg on guitar and William \"Billy\" Miller on vocals, formed The Ferrets in 1975. Also on the soundtrack album were Levi Smith's Clefs' members Michael Carlos and Henson. Carlos, on organ and piano, was also the musical director of the backing band, The Superstars, for the stage show and album, alongside Henson, Wade (ex-Climax), Jamie McKinley on piano and Bruce Worral on bass guitar (ex-Sherbet). John Young (later styled as John Paul Young) who had the role of Annas became a successful solo artist and toured with various fellow cast members as his backing band, The Allstars. The cast recording from the 1992 production won the Aria for Highest Selling Album and nominated for Best Original Soundtrack/Cast/Show Album."@en ;

In 2003, the album was released in LP format on Universal Records. Its sound is noted for being extremely sparse and minimal; Allmusic called it \"quite possibly the most quiet and intimate record ever made\". Hollis found inspiration not in the popular music of the day, but rather in 20th-century classical music and jazz from the late fifties and sixties. The album did not mark a return for Hollis to the music industry or live performance: he stated at the time of the album's release that \"There won't be any gig, not even at home in the living room. This material isn't suited to play live.\" The album was recorded as part of a two-album contract with Polydor, along with Talk Talk's 1991 Laughing Stock. Engineer Phill Brown, who also recorded Laughing Stock, stated that, compared to the final Talk Talk album, which he considered \"one of [his] best projects\" but \"dark and claustrophobic\", he found the solo release \"the opposite\u2026- open, restful and at times fantastically beautiful\". On 11 October 2011, Ba Da Bing Records released Mark Hollis on vinyl. This marks the first time that the album has been issued on vinyl in the US."@en ;

It was his first album of original material since Encore (2004), following a four-year hiatus from recording due to his writer's block and an addiction to prescription sleeping medication. Recording sessions for the album took place during 2005 to 2009 at several recording studios, and Dr. Dre, Mark Batson, and Eminem handled production.

Musically, it contains pop and dance-pop with influences of disco, electronic, funk, house, gothic rock, Hi-NRG, and hip hop. Lyrically, it revolves around teenage love, partying, self-empowerment, and personal growth. Perry co-wrote every song on the album, and also worked with a number of producers and writers, including Dr. Luke, Max Martin, Benny Blanco, Tricky Stewart, StarGate, Greg Kurstin, and Ester Dean. Upon its release, Teenage Dream received generally mixed reviews from music critics, who complimented its production and themes while denouncing Perry's songwriting. The album debuted at number one on the U.S. Billboard 200, selling 192,000 copies in its first week. It was later certified three times platinum by the RIAA; selling more than 3 million copies in the United States and charting within the Top 40 of the Billboard 200 year-end chart three years in a row. As of October 2013, Teenage Dream has sold 5.7 million copies worldwide. The album and its singles earned Perry seven Grammy Award nominations including Album of the Year, Best Pop Vocal Album, and Record of the Year, as well as winning International Album of the Year at the Juno Awards of 2011. The album was preceded by the number-one singles \"California Gurls\" and \"Teenage Dream\", and later produced the number-one singles \"Firework\", \"E.T.\", and \"Last Friday Night (T.G.I.F.)\". Its sixth \"The One That Got Away\" peaked at number three on the Billboard Hot 100. Teenage Dream is the second album in history to have five number ones from one album (after Michael Jackson's 1987 album Bad), the first by a female to achieve this milestone and the third album in history to produce eight top five hits. All six of the aforementioned singles, in addition to two from its 2012 reissue, have sold over two million digital downloads each in the U.S., setting a record in the digital era for the most multi-platinum singles from one album, breaking the previous record of Fergie's debut album The Dutchess (2006), which had five multi-platinum songs."@en ;

Tim Lambesis of As I Lay Dying and Daniel Castleman were brought on board to mix and tracking was handled by Kelly Cairns at Lambesis Studios in San Diego, CA (Sworn Enemy, Impending Doom, War of Ages). The band can be noted for having lyrics about politics, government conspiracies, and world issues, which is uncommon for the genre. A harbinger is a sign of things to come. Throughout history and literature, harbingers and omens figure prominently, and are responsible for major decisions which have altered the course of both.[better source needed]"@en ;

This album contained singles such as \"Thug Lovin'\" (featuring Bobby Brown), \"Mesmerize\" (featuring Ashanti) and \"The Pledge (Remix)\" (by Ashanti featuring Nas, Ja Rule and 2Pac). \"Murder Reigns\" was also released as a single titled \"Reign\" in select territories outside of North America, such as Europe and Australasia. The song \"Pop Niggas\" gained some attention after it was reported to be talking in part about 50 Cent. Pharrell was featured in the song, but not credited. Other guests featured on the album include: Bobby Brown, Ashanti, Nas, Alexi, Charli Baltimore, 2Pac, Caddillac Tah, Celeste Scalone, Eastwood, Crooked I, Young Life & Chink Santana. The album was successful, moving 237,000 units in its first week, but less than his previous Pain Is Love. \"Mesmerize\" is ranked at #45 on Blender's list of the \"50 Worst Songs Ever\", but was the most successful single from the album, reaching number 2 on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 and number 12 on the UK Singles Chart. It was also criticized by fans, saying that the album sounded too commercial, and that Ja Rule was selling out; in addition, many of Ja Rule's enemies such as Daz Dillinger, Eminem, 50 Cent, Dr. Dre, G-Unit, Obie Trice, D12, Busta Rhymes, and DMX said that Ja Rule was trying to be just like Tupac Shakur, which fueled the rivalry even more.[citation needed] Though it did not manage to surpass Pain Is Love, The Last Temptation is Ja Rule's third most popular album to date. The album was released in a censored version as well which removes most profanity. However, sex-related lyrics like \"gettin' head\" and violent lyrics like \"murder\" are left in."@en ;

Upon its initial release in 1968, it only had ten songs. After the success of Diamond's next three albums, it was re-issued in 1970 with a new sleeve and now included a remake of \"Shilo\", a song that had previously been recorded for Bang Records, and had appeared on the preceding album, Just For You. His motivation for doing this was the release of the song as a single by his old record label with a new backing track and alternate vocal take recorded at Chips Moman's American Studios in Memphis, and its chart position at #24 outselling Diamond's concurrently-released single \"Until It's Time for You to Go\", which only reached #53. The album quotes: \"Much credit for \"The Pot Smoker's Song\" must go to the kids of Phoenix House in New York City.

Five of the six songs are instrumental (\"Willie the Pimp\" features a short vocal by Captain Beefheart). It was Zappa's first recording project after the dissolution of the original Mothers of Invention. In his original sleeve notes Zappa described the album as \"a movie for your ears.\" Because Hot Rats largely consists of instrumental jazz-influenced compositions with extensive soloing, the music sounds very different from earlier Zappa albums, which featured satirical vocal performances with extensive use of musique concr\u00E8te and editing. Multi-instrumentalist Ian Underwood is the only member of the Mothers to appear on the album and was the primary musical collaborator. Other featured musicians were Max Bennett and Shuggie Otis on bass, drummers John Guerin, Paul Humphrey and Ron Selico, and electric violinists Don \"Sugarcane\" Harris and Jean-Luc Ponty. This was the first Frank Zappa album recorded on 16-track equipment and one of the first albums to use this technology. Machines with 16 individual tracks allow for much more flexibility in multi-tracking and overdubbing than the professional 4- and 8-track reel-to-reel tape recorders that were standard in 1969. The album was dedicated to Zappa's newborn son, Dweezil Zappa. In February 2009, Dweezil's tribute band to his father's musical legacy, Zappa Plays Zappa, won a Grammy for Best Rock Instrumental Performance for their rendition of \"Peaches en Regalia.\" In the Q & Mojo Classic Special Edition Pink Floyd & The Story of Prog Rock, the album came #13 in its list of \"40 Cosmic Rock Albums\".

Although Queen would release another two albums with Freddie Mercury (excluding posthumous releases), A Kind of Magic would turn out to be the band's last album promoted with a concert tour, because of Mercury's diagnosis with AIDS the following year, which subsequently caused his death in 1991. For the first time in their career, the band allowed filming of them while they were in the recording studio. The video for \"One Vision\" shows them in various stages of writing and recording the song. A Kind of Magic reached #1 in the UK, selling 100,000 copies in its first week, and remained in the UK charts for 63 weeks and sold about 6 million copies worldwide (600.000 in UK only). The album spawned four hit singles: the album's title track \"A Kind of Magic\", \"One Vision\", \"Friends Will Be Friends\", and \"Who Wants to Live Forever\", which features an orchestra conducted by Michael Kamen, while the last track, \"Princes of the Universe\", is the theme song to Highlander."@en ;

It was released in February 1976 on Charisma Records and was the first album to feature drummer Phil Collins as lead vocalist following the departure of Peter Gabriel. It was a critical and commercial success in the UK and U.S., reaching No. 3 and No. 31 respectively. Following Gabriel's decision to leave the band, the remaining members wanted to carry on and show they could still write and record successful material. The group wrote and rehearsed new songs during mid-1975, and listened to around 400 audition tapes for a replacement frontman. They entered Trident Studios in October with producer David Hentschel to record the album without a definitive idea of who was going to perform lead vocals. Eventually, Collins was persuaded to sing \"Squonk\", and the performance was so strong, he sang lead on the rest of album. Upon release, critics were impressed by the improved sound quality and the group's ability to survive the loss of Gabriel without sacrificing the quality of the music. The group went out on tour with Collins as frontman and Bill Bruford as an additional drummer, and the resulting performances in the US raised Genesis' profile there. The album has been reissued on CD in several times, including a deluxe package with bonus tracks in 2007."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Three of a Perfect Pair is the tenth studio album by the band King Crimson, released in 1984. The album is a balance between the experimental Discipline, and the more commercially accessible Beat. Tony Levin had more input than on any other King Crimson album.[citation needed] It is divided into a \"left\" and \"right\" side, with a third side added in 2001. One of the bonus tracks is a barbershop a cappella in which all four members supposedly sing but is really Levin's voice overdubbed to create harmonization. Following the literary theme of the preceding two albums, the album title may be a subtle nod to the novel Nineteen Eighty-Four, as the album was released in the actual year 1984. The name is based on the idea of perfect opposites and \"three sides to every story,\" or His, Hers and an objective truth. The Peter Willis designed artwork illustrates the sacred\u2013profane dichotomy while being a simplified version of the Larks' Tongues in Aspic cover; a rising phallic object represents a male solar deity about to penetrate the crescent figure, a female lunar deity. However, one can also make out a Christian cross if staring at the empty spaces between the figures. The back cover illustration is the same but adds a third element, a curved line stretching to reconcile the opposing sides. Tracks 10-15 were added for the 2001 remaster. Two of the three \"Sleepless\" mixes were previously available on the UK 12\" single. The Bob Clearmountain mix appeared (incorrectly credited and against the band's wishes) on the U.S. Warner Bros.

On Tri Repetae, Garbage and Anvil Vapre the rhythmic patterns became more minimal and repetitive and the melodic arrays got more intricate and spatialized in comparison to their previous albums Incunabula and Amber. The acknowledged influence of avant garde artist Tod Dockstader begin to materialise during this period of their career, as well as the work of Gy\u00F6rgy Ligeti, Iannis Xenakis and Edgard Varese to whom Autechre first listened on the early 90s and cited as significant inspiration in an interview they gave to The Wire on 2003."@en ;

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aaliyah_(album)>	rdf:type	schema:MusicAlbum ;
	dbo:abstract	"Aaliyah is the third and final studio album by American R&B recording artist Aaliyah, released on July 7, 2001, by Blackground Records and Virgin Records. After raising her profile with hit soundtrack singles during the late 1990s, Aaliyah started to work on the album in 1998, but rescheduled its recording around her developing film career. She resumed recording the record in 2000 at Sing Sing Studios in Australia, where she shot her role for the 2002 film Queen of the Damned during the day and recorded songs at night. Aaliyah worked primarily with Blackground's in-house crew of writers and producers, including Bud'da, J. Dub, Rapture, and Eric Seats, as well as longtime collaborator Timbaland. Aaliyah was an R&B and neo soul record whose music drew on funk, hip hop, alternative rock, and electronica sounds, among others. The producers incorporated synthesizer melodies, fragmented beats, distorted guitar, and eccentrically manipulated vocals and song structures. Much of Aaliyah dealt with the complexities of romantic love and different stages in a relationship. Most of the songs were written by lyricist Static Major, who shared a close friendship and strong rapport with Aaliyah. She viewed the album as a reflection of herself as both a young adult and a matured vocalist. Aaliyah received highly positive reviews from critics and debuted at number two on the Billboard 200, but sold diminishingly afterwards. When Blackground and Virgin wanted a high charting single to increase the album's sales, Aaliyah shot a music video for the song \"Rock the Boat\" in the Bahamas, but died in a plane crash on a return flight to the United States on August 25, 2001. After her death, sales of the album skyrocketed and propelled it to number one on the Billboard 200. Aaliyah was released during a period of peak activity in contemporary R&B and, since its initial reception, has been cited by critics as one of the best R&B records of its time."@en ;

It was also the band's first album released by Geffen Records. It was intended as their \"comeback\" album, and while it got good reviews during its release, it did not live up to commercial expectations. \"Let The Music Do the Talking\" was a new recording of the title track of the first album by The Joe Perry Project, with altered lyrics and melody. In an interview, Brad Whitford revealed that Ted Templeman wanted to capture the band's aggressive \"out of control freight train\" sound by removing the red light that indicated that the band was recording (a technique he used to capture Van Halen's sound). He informed the band to run through the songs in the studio and recorded them without the band's knowledge. Whitford referred to the nerves generated when knowingly recording songs as \"the red light blues\". Joey Kramer, who was a guest on VH1 Classic's That Metal Show, expressed his dislike of Done with Mirrors, claiming that the band \"never really finished it\". Joe Perry was similarly dismissive of Done with Mirrors in an interview with Noisecreep, stating that he \"really didn't like [the album].\""@en ;

Fold Your Hands Child... features songs at a slower pace than their other albums, making it their most quiet and mellow album yet. The album is the closest the band has come to the chamber pop genre, as the instrumentation is mostly acoustic. The band introduced many stylistic changes on this album, such as an organic strings section and more songs with lead vocals by other members of the band; Sarah Martin sings on \"Waiting for the Moon to Rise\", Isobel Campbell sings on \"Family Tree\", and performs duets with Stevie Jackson (who sings in an unusually low voice) on \"Beyond the Sunrise\" and Stuart Murdoch on \"Women's Realm\". Jackson also sings lead vocal on \"The Wrong Girl\". It is the last Belle & Sebastian album to feature bass player Stuart David, who departed the band after the album's completion. The twin sisters pictured on the cover are Gy\u00F0a and Krist\u00EDn Anna Valt\u00FDsd\u00F3ttir both former members of the Icelandic experimental group m\u00FAm. The album's title comes from a piece of graffiti on a public toilet wall Stuart Murdoch had seen years earlier and remembered. The opening track \"I Fought in A War\" was used in the notable 2004 BBC documentary The Power of Nightmares. It was also used in the 2005 Eugene Jarecki documentary Why We Fight.

It was his first collaboration since 1980 with Steely Dan partner Walter Becker, who produced the album. The album is a futuristic, optimistic eight-song cycle about the journey of the narrator in his high-tech car, the Kamakiri (Japanese for praying mantis). It was nominated for a Grammy Award for Album of the Year in 1993. The album follows a lengthy writer's block for Fagen; the songs are based on personal observations about middle age (as 1982's The Nightfly is lyrically described as fantasies of Fagen's youth and 2006's Morph the Cat ruminations of old age and death). Music videos were produced for \"Tomorrow's Girls\" (starring Rick Moranis) and \"Snowbound\" (using stop motion animation). Fagen and Becker would embark on their first tour as Steely Dan since 1974 to support the album, leading gradually to a permanent reunion."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Poets and Madmen is the eleventh studio album by the heavy metal band Savatage, released in 2001. It was their last album before their 12-year hiatus, which lasted from 2002 to 2014. The album has a loose concept inspired by the career and death of journalist Kevin Carter, but has much less narrative in the lyrics than the previous two rock operas (Dead Winter Dead and The Wake of Magellan) penned by Paul O'Neill. Everything said in the album is fiction, except with regards to what is sung about Carter. The album is also noted as it is the only Savatage album to not feature a title song from the album, although the title was taken from lyrics to the track \"Symmetry\" from the band's 1994 album, Handful of Rain. The album was the first since Streets: A Rock Opera in 1991 to feature the band's original vocalist Jon Oliva on lead vocals for all songs after the amicable departure of Zachary Stevens. It is also the first Savatage album to have guitarist Chris Caffery playing the majority of the guitar solos. This is partly due to the departure of Al Pitrelli, who left to join Megadeth prior to the album's release. However, Pitrelli was credited with the outro of \"Stay With Me Awhile,\" the main solo of \"Morphine Child,\" the main solo of \"The Rumor,\" and the first part of the main solo and the outro of \"Commissar\". The United States bonus track \"Shotgun Innocence\" was originally a bonus track on the Japanese release of Edge of Thorns in 1993 and features Zachary Stevens on lead vocals, and the late Criss Oliva on guitar. The album cover was drawn by Edgar Jerins, who was responsible for the covers of Dead Winter Dead and The Wake of Magellan."@en ;

(If that was indeed the intention, EMI miscalculated, as the two actually first met in July 1957.) The title, Rock 'n' Roll Music, presumably came from the song of the same name by Chuck Berry, The Beatles' version of which is included on side two of the original two-record set. The album is a combination of some notable Lennon\u2013McCartney originals, such as \"Drive My Car\", \"Revolution\", \"Back in the U.S.S.R.\" and \"Get Back\", George Harrison's \"Taxman\", and a dozen cover versions of songs written by significant rock and roll composers of the '50s, including Chuck Berry, Little Richard, Carl Perkins and Larry Williams.

Themes of parenting and family life first heard here on songs such as, \"When He Cries\" and \"Cypress Trees\" have now become a regular feature of Gorka's subsequent albums.

dbr:Ashtray_Rock	rdf:type	schema:MusicAlbum ;
	dbo:abstract	"Ashtray Rock is an album by Canadian indie rock band Joel Plaskett Emergency, released on April 17, 2007. In interviews, band frontman Joel Plaskett has noted that Ashtray Rock is not a genre of music, but an actual location\u2014in the forest west of Clayton Park, Nova Scotia\u2014where teenagers go to get drunk. The album is a concept album about two friends growing up in Halifax, Nova Scotia, who form a band together, fall for the same girl, and have a falling-out in their friendship. Plaskett intended a nostalgic feel to the album, and used songs from his days with the band Thrush Hermit: \"Snowed In\" was performed live by that band, \"The Glorious Life\" is from 1994, and the title track Plaskett wrote in 1992 when he was age 17. The album is Plaskett's most personal. He has suggested that his former Thrush Hermit bandmates will recognize themselves in some of the narrative, and that one of the main character's musical tastes are similar to those of his wife, Nova Scotia graphic artist and cartoonist Rebecca Kraatz, who designed the album cover art. \"Snowed In\" and \"Fashionable People\" have both been released as singles in Canada. On July 10, 2007, the shortlist for the Polaris Music Prize was revealed. Ashtray Rock was announced as a finalist, alongside such other acts as Arcade Fire, The Besnard Lakes, and Feist. Patrick Watson was, however, announced the winner on September 24, 2007. The track \"Introduction\" consists of a small part of the track \"Soundtrack for the Night.\""@en ;

The song \"Our Country\" received significant exposure prior to the release of the album, as it was featured in frequently-aired commercials for Chevrolet trucks. The country band Little Big Town provides background vocals on eight songs on the album, including \"Our Country.\" Mellencamp intended for Freedom's Road to have a 1960s rock sound while still remaining contemporary, and he feels that goal was achieved. \"We wanted to make sure that it had the same feeling of some of the great songs from the '60s but also had the message of today and had the backbeat of today.

The song is in the key of G# and is centered on piano and French horn. The lyrics, often said to be written by the band's frontman Sean Nelson, describe someone telling another unknown person (perhaps a loved one) told to love someone at least half as much as they love themselves (known as their \"little round mirrors\"). The second track, \"Oh! You Pretty Things\" is a live cover of a David Bowie song. \"We Drew the Maps\" is the first Harvey Danger song not to feature Sean Nelson on lead vocals, instead being sung by Aaron Huffman, the band's bass player who also plays guitar on the track, the bass being played by John Roderick of The Long Winters. The final two tracks are live recordings of songs off the band's debut album Where Have All The Merrymakers Gone?. They're both very different from the album versions of the songs and feature a greater emphasis on piano."@en ;

The Final Fantasy X-2 Original Soundtrack was released on two Compact Discs in 2003 by Avex. After the release of Final Fantasy X-2 International + Last Mission, an album entitled Final Fantasy X-2 International + Last Mission Original Soundtrack composed of the songs added to the soundtrack for that game was released in 2003 by Avex. Final Fantasy X-2 Piano Collection, a collection of piano arrangements of the original soundtracks by Noriko Matsueda, Takahito Eguchi, Hiroko Kokubu, Masahiro Sayama, and Febian Reza Pane, was released by Avex in 2004. A single by Koda Kumi entitled real Emotion/1000 no Kotoba, based on the theme song for the game and the ending credits song, was published by Rhythm Zone prior to the game's release in 2003. Another single, titled Eternity ~Memories of Waves and Light~ Music from Final Fantasy X-2, was released by Avex in 2003 along with the original soundtrack. It consisted of live arrangements of several of the game's songs, composed and arranged by Noriko Matsueda and Takahito Eguchi. A set of three singles entitled Final Fantasy X-2 Vocal Collection- Paine, Rikku, and Yuna was published by Avex in 2003, with each single including vocal arrangements of songs from the game, sung by the respective character's voice actress. The soundtrack received mixed reviews from critics; while several felt that the music was good and keeping in tone with the game, others found it to be odd and shallow. Several reviewers attributed the change to the lack of participation by Uematsu. Final Fantasy X-2 International + Last Mission Original Soundtrack and Final Fantasy X-2 Piano Collection, on the other hand, were very well received by critics, who felt that they were far superior to the original soundtrack. The singles for the soundtrack were poorly received by critics, who found a few of the songs to be enjoyable but all of the singles to be overpriced."@en ;

Wainwright's most commercially successful album to date, Release the Stars charted in 13 countries, reaching Top 10 positions in Denmark, Norway, and the United Kingdom, and was certified gold in Canada and the UK. The album generated three singles: \"Going to a Town\", which peaked at number 54 on the UK Singles Chart, \"Rules and Regulations\", and \"Tiergarten\". Wainwright originally planned to create a more simple piano and voice album, but began leaning towards more lush sounds once the recording process started. Guests on Release the Stars include Richard Thompson, longtime friend and fellow singer-songwriter Teddy Thompson, family members Martha Wainwright and Kate McGarrigle, Neil Tennant, Joan Wasser, and actress Si\u00E2n Phillips. The world tour supporting the album lasted from May 2007 to February 2008, and included tour stops in North America, Europe, Asia and Australia.

A collection of ambitious songs which combined classical, jazz, soul and ambient influences in an original and emotional way, the album received good reviews in Q, Uncut and Classic rock. Additionally, having signed to Lava/WEA, the increasing profile of Steven Wilson's work with Porcupine Tree brought the No-Man name to a new audience. One of the guest musicians on the album was Porcupine Tree's Colin Edwin,who played double bass. Unusually, the tracks \"All That You Are\" and \"Carolina Skeletons\" were released as singles, in the first case two years after the album's release (February, 2003) and in the latter three years prior to it (October, 1998). In August 2006, the album was released in a limited edition triple vinyl format on the Dutch label, Tonefloat. This edition included outtakes, demos and b-sides taken from the recording sessions (which spanned 7 years). In keeping with other No-Man releases, \"Something Falls\" reuses previous Steven Wilson music, reinterpreting the guitar progression from \"Spiral Circus\" (on The Sky Moves Sideways by his main band, Porcupine Tree)."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Taylor Swift is the debut studio album by American singer-songwriter Taylor Swift, released on October 24, 2006, by Big Machine Records. Swift was 16 years old at the time of the album's release and wrote its songs during her freshman year of high school. Swift has writing credits on all of the album's songs, including those co-written with Liz Rose. Swift experimented with several producers, ultimately choosing Nathan Chapman, who had produced her demo album. Musically, the album is country music styled, and lyrically it speaks of romantic relationships, a couple of which Swift wrote from observing relationships before being in one. Lyrics also touch on Swift's personal struggles in high school. Five singles were released from the album, all of which have been certified platinum by the RIAA. \"Tim McGraw\" was released as the lead single and reached the top ten on Billboard's Hot Country Songs. \"Teardrops on My Guitar\" was released as the second single and was the album's best-charting song on the Billboard Hot 100. \"Our Song\" was released as the third single from the album and was Swift's first number one on Billboard's Hot Country Songs chart. It made her the youngest person to single-handedly write and perform a number one song on the Hot Country Songs chart. \"Picture to Burn\" and \"Should've Said No\" were released as the fourth single and fifth singles from the album, respectively, and both were a success on the country charts in the United States. Swift promoted the album by performing on tour as the opening act for artists such as Rascal Flatts, George Strait, Brad Paisley, and Tim McGraw and Faith Hill. Taylor Swift was received positively by contemporary critics, who praised Swift's talent at such a young age. The album enjoyed commercial success and launched Swift's career in country music. In the United States, it topped the Top Country Albums Chart for 24 non-consecutive weeks, and was certified five times platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for sales of over 5 million copies. Taylor Swift has logged 275 weeks on the Billboard Top 200 / Pop Albums chart as of early 2013, making it one of the 12 longest-running albums in the chart's 57-year history. The album was also successful outside of Swift's native country, notably, Canada, Australia, and the United Kingdom. The album has sold over six million copies worldwide as of January 2015."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Together We're Stranger is No-Man's fifth studio album released by the Snapper Music label in 2003. The first four songs are linked to form a 28-minute suite of continuous music with recurring lyrical and musical themes. Atmospheric and ambitious, this aspect of the album in some way recalls the more Ambient elements of Pink Floyd, Brian Eno and Miles Davis and the later experiments of Mark Hollis/Talk Talk. The remaining three songs prominently feature acoustic guitar and clarinet dominated arrangements and are amongst the band's most stripped-down and intimate recordings. Comparable in parts to the \"exposed\" approach of bands such as Red House Painters, Lambchop or Low, Together We're Stranger represents the band's sparsest and most directly emotional work to date. In keeping with other No-Man releases, the title track reuses the musical basis of a previous Steven Wilson work: that of \"Drugged\" from his first Bass Communion album.

The album was released on Matador in 1996; a Japanese version with two extra tracks appeared in 1998. The title is a pun on the 1960 Ray Charles album, Genius+Soul=Jazz. (\"The Genius\" was Charles' nickname.) The first disc contains songs with vocals. There are several cover songs, such as John Cale's \"Hanky Panky Nohow,\" The Velvet Underground's \"I'm Set Free,\" Beat Happening's \"Cast A Shadow,\" and Wire's \"Too Late.\" The cover of Daniel Johnston's \"Speeding Motorcycle\" features Johnston calling in his vocals to the song via telephone. \"Demons\" originally appeared on the soundtrack to the 1995 film I Shot Andy Warhol (in which YLT appeared as a Velvet Underground-esque band). The second disc consists entirely of instrumental pieces. Included are songs previously recorded by the group (such as an 8-second drum solo), and covers, such as The Urinals' \"Surfin' With The Shah,\" and a wedding-band-like rendition of the Ramones' \"Blitzkrieg Bop.\" \"Sunsquashed\" is a 26-minute psychedelic jam, from which one of the band's main fansites took its name."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Greatest Hits, also titled Garth Brooks in.... The Life of Chris Gaines, is an album by American country music artist Garth Brooks, in which Brooks assumes the fictitious persona of rock artist Chris Gaines. Originally, this album was intended to be the soundtrack for a movie called The Lamb that would star Brooks as a rock star recalling the different periods of his life. This album was purposely released a year in advance from the scheduled film release date to pique interest in Brooks performing rock instead of country. The Lamb, however, was never filmed due to financial and management problems. This was released on September 28, 1999. It reached No. 2 on the Billboard 200 chart, and also gained Brooks his first and to date only appearance on the U.S. Top 40 of the Billboard Hot 100, with \"Lost in You\", which peaked at No. 5. The track \"It Don't Matter to the Sun\" was later covered in 2005, by Rosie Thomas on her If Songs Could Be Held album. On November 13, 1999, Brooks hosted Saturday Night Live as himself but performed the musical numbers as Chris Gaines without acknowledging to the audience that they were the same person. He performed \"Way of the Girl.\" The album had disappointing sales compared to Brooks previous albums, with some citing Brooks' image change of wig and make up, and the album's rock-star concept for this fact."@en ;

This is the first song to win any Eurovision Song Contest in an imaginary language. Ukraine took 2nd place and Lithuania finished 3rd. Bzikebi also became the first group act to win Junior Eurovision. The theme of the event was \"Fun in the Sun\", despite the fact that there were thunderstorms in Lemesos the day of the contest. The stage, which was designed by George Papadopoulos, was nominated for the prestigious international \"Live Design Excellence Awards\". The design is an abstract composition and consists of a round stage representing the island of Cyprus, real water along the front of the stage, two jetties, the waves breaking and moving away from the island and five sailing boats with oars. For the contest, various changes to the rules were made. One was that adults could assist children to write the songs submitted to their national broadcaster; previously only children could write the songs, with no assistance from adults. Another change was only six people could be on stage during a performance, instead of eight. The most significant change, however, was only half of the vote was decided by the tele-voters. Before the 2008 contest tele-voters completely decided the whole result. The other half of the result was decided by a jury of adults and children."@en ;

The line-up is David, Downes, bassist Chris Squire, guitarist Steve Howe and drummer Alan White. The album was produced by Trevor Horn, who was the singer on Drama, and who had previously produced 90125 (1983) and initially Big Generator (1987). The album takes its name from its main work, \"Fly from Here\", a 24-minute composition split up into six songs. The basis of the hexalogy was a demo originally recorded by Downes and Horn of The Buggles before they joined Yes in 1980. After Yes disbanded in 1981, Horn and Downes recorded a second demo, and both recordings became the foundation of the tracks \"We Can Fly\" and \"Sad Night at the Airfield\". Fly from Here was first released on 22 June 2011 in Japan and France, followed by releases on 1 July in the rest of Europe and Australia and on 12 July in the United States.

Recording sessions for the album took place at Blakeslee Recording Company in Los Angeles during 2009 to 2010. Inspired by the loud, raw sound of his live performances, Saadiq worked with recording engineer and long-time collaborator Chuck Brungardt to produce a grittier, more aggressive sound for the album. Primarily performed by Saadiq, Stone Rollin' expands on the traditional soul music style of his previous 2008 album, The Way I See It, with an homage to rhythm and blues, incorporating styles such as funk, blues, and rock music. Music writers have noted the album for its stylistic breadth, groove-based compositions, contemporary detail, varied subject matter, and incorporation of the Mellotron keyboard. Initially released in Europe, the album charted in several other countries before reaching number 14 on the US Billboard 200. It was Saadiq's highest-charting release there and produced four singles, including the US R&B hit \"Good Man\". Stone Rollin' received general acclaim from music critics, who praised its traditional influences, musical eclecticism, and Saadiq's songwriting. Saadiq promoted the album with a concert tour spanning from March to August 2011."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"We're New Here is a remix album by American recording artist Gil Scott-Heron and English music producer Jamie xx, released on February 21, 2011, by Young Turks and XL Recordings. A longtime fan of Scott-Heron, Jamie xx was approached by XL label head Richard Russell to remix Scott-Heron's 2010 studio album I'm New Here. He worked on the album while touring with his band The xx in 2010 and occasionally communicated with Scott-Heron through letters for his approval to rework certain material. Incorporating dubstep and UK garage styles, Jamie xx applied electronic music techniques in his production to remix Scott-Heron's vocals from the original album over his own instrumentals. Although it is structured similarly, We're New Here eschews the original album's stark style and lo-fi production for bass-driven, musically varied production and sonical illumination of Scott-Heron's vocals. It has been noted by music writers for recontextualizing Scott-Heron's narratives in Jamie xx's own musical influences and tastes. Although it did not chart in the United States, the album debuted at number 33 on the UK Albums Chart, on which it spent two weeks. It was promoted with a multi-format release, including a limited edition box set, and the release of two singles, \"NY Is Killing Me\" and \"I'll Take Care of U\". We're New Here received universal acclaim from critics upon its release."@en ;

Rahman, Boyle's previous collaborator on Slumdog Millionaire. The score, centred on guitar, was recorded mainly in London and was completed in three weeks. The soundtrack was released digitally on 2 November and physically on 22 November, by Interscope Records. The score is briefly orchestral and the song's main theme, \"If I Rise\" features Rahman playing the Harpejji. The soundtrack album includes original score and the theme song composed by Rahman, the tracks \"Never Hear Surf Music Again\" by Free Blood, \"Lovely Day\" by Bill Withers, Fr\u00E9d\u00E9ric Chopin's Nocturne No.2 in E flat, Op.9 No.2, \"\u00C7a plane pour moi\" by Plastic Bertrand, \"If You Love Me\" by Esther Phillips, and \"Festival\" by Sigur R\u00F3s. The original theme song of the film, \"If I Rise\", is written by A. R. Rahman (music), Dido and Rollo Armstrong (lyrics) and performed by Dido along with Rahman. It was featured in the climax scene of the film. The film's subject Aron Ralston's favourite band, Phish, is mentioned in the film. During production, Boyle asked Ralston how Phish lyrics could be included in the film. Ralston sings lines from the Phish song \"Sleeping Monkey\" when swimming in one of the early scenes of the movie. But the soundtrack album did not feature this song. Another song \"The Funeral\" from Band of Horses is not in the soundtrack album, but is used in the end of the trailer."@en ;

While all the group's albums had been almost entirely collections of previously released material, \"Koko ni Ita Koto\" took a different approach. Although it featured four 2010 hits, one theatre stage song, and a theme from an early 2011 movie, the rest were new songs. Although the album was negatively received by English J-pop journalists, it met with great commercial success, topping the Oricon Weekly Albums Chart and, with just one week of sales, placed second in the list of best selling albums of the first half of 2011 in Japan. In the same month, it was already certified Million by the Recording Industry Association of Japan for shipments of over one million copies."@en ;

The song was re-recorded during their album sessions in June 2010, but never mixed or finished for inclusion on the album. Most songs were already written and demoed in 2009. The songs \"Secrets\" and \"Hide and Seek\" originally started as Mumm-Ra songs, written by James New. \"Secrets\" was later transformed into a 14 minutes song though the band decided to edit the track down to 10 minutes due to pressure from the record label. Mirrors released a few demos in 2009 and 2010 of songs that would later appear on the album, being \"Hide and Seek\", \"Organ Song\" (which would be re-titled to \"Write Through the Night\"), \"Searching in the Wilderness\", \"Look at Me\", \"Into the Heart\", \"Fear of Drowning\" and \"Somewhere Strange\"."@en ;

Upon the release of the album, Sand\u00E9's vocal ability has been compared[by whom?] to the likes of Aretha Franklin, Whitney Houston, Beyonc\u00E9 and Annie Lennox. Tracy Chapman, Nina Simone, Joni Mitchell and Lauryn Hill are all major influences for her album.

It was released by Minos EMI in Greece and Cyprus on 14 December 2010 and distributed digitally ten days later to all Eurozone countries and elsewhere. Along with the standard retail edition, a special edition was also sold, which included a bonus pictorial fan magazine with lyrics. Recording dates for the album lasted over one year and concluding in November 2010. Rouvas collaborated with several songwriters and producers, including previous collaborators Dimitris Kontopoulos and Natalia Germanou and the rest mostly new collaborators, including recent hit makers Freakchild, Playmen, and Beetkraft. Rouvas continues to serve as executive producer and financier, a role he had adopted since 2006. The release offers new sounds and themes for Rouvas, while still focusing on his established pop, rock, and electronic genres. There are a total of 15 tracks as well as four music videos of the first three singles all on an Enhanced CD. The album was inspired by Rouvas' upcoming 20th anniversary as an entertainer in 2011; he drew inspiration from his experiences, the relationship with his fans, and the music and messages he had created during the past two decades and combined all of these elements into one album, which he described as the best of his career. The album represents the turn Rouvas is taking in the next phase of his career. Trident resumed its role as album sponsor and in promotion held a contest, the largest ever of its kind in Greece. Samples of the songs were uploaded by Rouvas leading up to the release, causing unprecedented traffic on the internet for such uploads by a Greek artist. The initial reaction from the mass consumer audience and professional music critics was largely favourable. Rouvas supported the album through his winter 2009\u20132010 resident show The S Club, a spring 2010 summer resident show at Politia Live Clubbing and a simultaneous national tour, as well as his 2010\u201311 resident show Face2Face. He later embarked at The S Club at Thalassa in 2011 and Underworld S Club at Athens Arena in 2011\u20132012. Parafora debuted at number two on the Greek IFPI Top 75 Albums and topped the chart for two consecutive weeks. It has so far spent ten non-consecutive weeks in the top ten. After one week of sales it was announced by Rouvas himself that the album's initial shipments were enough to warrant a double platinum certification. The album sold thousands of digital copies and became the most successful albums of the year. It is awaiting a multi-platinum certification on 7 December 2011. Prior to its release, the album had already generated three chart-topping singles: \"Spase To Hrono\", \"Emena Thes\", and the title track, while \"I Dio Mas\" followed and \"Nekros Okeanos\" was confirmed as a future single. \"Kalokairi Kai Fos\" was also released as a promotional single while \"Gia Mas\" also charted. The album and its singles have earned Rouvas several awards. The first single was nominated for a record-breaking five MAD Video Music Awards, winning three\u2014including Artist of the Year\u2014and a Balkan Music Award. Rouvas also won an MTV Europe Music Award and two Status Men of the Year Awards, while he won three MAD Video Music Awards in 2011, including the two most coveted prizes, Video of the Year and Artist of the Year for \"Parafora\" and \"I Dio Mas\", respectively."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Pull Up Some Dust and Sit Down is the fourteenth studio album by American recording artist Ry Cooder, released August 30, 2011, on Nonesuch Records. Following his 2008 album I, Flathead, Cooder pursued more political direction with his songwriting and was inspired by the late-2000s economic crisis and past protest songs. The album was written and produced by Cooder, who recorded at Drive-By Studios, Ocean Studios, and Wireland Studios in California. He played various instruments and worked with musicians such as Flaco Jim\u00E9nez, Juliette Commagere, Robert Francis, and Jim Keltner. The album features topical songs with socio-political subject matter about 21st-century America, including politics, war, economic disparity, and social injustice. Its music is rooted in Americana and incorporates traditional styles and musical language from historical sources such as country blues, tejano, and American roots music. Pull Up Some Dust and Sit Down has been noted by music writers for its eclectic musical range, allegorical songs, working-class perspective, and Cooder's sardonic lyrics. Pull Up Some Dust and Sit Down charted modestly in the United States, but relatively higher in Europe. Cooder expressed disillusionment with the music industry in response to its poor commercial performance. The album received universal acclaim from critics, several of whom compared Cooder to folk singer-songwriter Woody Guthrie. According to Slant Magazine's Joseph Jon Lanthier, \"the orchestrated indignation of [the album] incorporated a protean Greek chorus of economic victims and beat Occupy Wall Street to the punch by several weeks.\""@en ;

It was recorded after Scott's four-year break from her music career and departure from her former label, Hidden Beach Recordings. The Light of the Sun was recorded at several studios and produced primarily by Scott and JR Hutson, a songwriter and producer who had previously worked on her 2007 record The Real Thing: Words and Sounds Vol. 3. Music journalists noted The Light of the Sun for its neo soul sound, element of improvisation, and Scott's feminine themes.

dbr:To_Notice_Such_Things	rdf:type	schema:MusicAlbum ;
	dbo:abstract	"To Notice Such Things is a studio album by former Deep Purple keyboard player Jon Lord, released in 2010. It is titled after the main work, a six-movement suite for solo flute, piano and string orchestra, composed by Lord in memory of his close friend the late Sir John Mortimer, CBE, QC. The music emanates from that which Lord composed for the stage show, Mortimer\u2019s Miscellany, which he also occasionally accompanied. To Notice Such Things is the last line of the Thomas Hardy poem \u201CAfterwards\u201D, which ended the show. Jon says of the piece, \"I wanted to give the flute the job of speaking for John throughout the Suite; his laughter and his sighs, his wistfulness and occasional mild cantankerousness, his playfulness, and also the anguish and then the acceptance of his final days.\" The flute solo in the recording of To Notice Such Things, is performed by the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra\u2019s principal flautist Cormac Henry, who throughout the work engages in dexterous musical dialogue with Lord\u2019s solo piano. Jon Lord performed three movements from To Notice Such Things at Mortimer\u2019s memorial service at Southwark Cathedral in November 2009, in front of an audience that included the Duchess of Cornwall, members of the Mortimer family, Lord Mandelson, Lord Kinnock, Jeremy Paxman, Alan Rickman, Peter O\u2019Toole, Sir Tom Stoppard and Jeremy Irons, whose noble reading of \u201CAfterwards\u201D closes the recording of To Notice Such Things. To Notice Such Things has been performed live a few times, most notably on June 16, 2010 at Liverpool's Philharmonic Hall with Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra conducted by Clark Rundell."@en ;

It was released on April 12, 2011 on RCA Records, and is the first album to feature rhythm guitarist Pat Smear since The Colour and the Shape (1997), making the band a five piece with the album. Wishing to capture the essence of the group's earlier work and avoid the artificiality of digital recording, frontman Dave Grohl arranged for the band to record in his garage in Encino, California using only analog equipment. The sessions were supervised by producer Butch Vig, with whom Grohl had worked on Nirvana's Nevermind. Since the old equipment did not allow for many mistakes to be corrected in post-production, the band spent three weeks rehearsing the songs, and Vig had to relearn outdated editing techniques. The band went for a heavier and rawer sound to contrast with the musical experiments from their previous albums, and most of the lyrics were written as Grohl reflected upon his life and possible future. Guest musicians include Bob Mould, Krist Novoselic, Jessy Greene, Rami Jaffe and Fee Waybill. The recording sessions were documented for fans on the band's website and Twitter, and the album's promotion included the documentary Back and Forth and a worldwide concert tour that included concerts played in fans' garages. Wasting Light was preceded by the successful single \"Rope\", which became only the second song ever to debut at number one on Billboard's Rock Songs chart. The follow-up single, \"Walk\", also charted highly. The album was a commercial success, debuting at number one in eleven countries, and it received positive reviews from most music critics, who complimented its production and the band's songwriting. In 2012, Wasting Light and its songs earned Foo Fighters five Grammy Awards, including Best Rock Album."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Common Courtesy is the fifth studio album by American rock band A Day to Remember. Songs for the album were written mid-2011, with recording starting from early-2012 and going into March 2013, with mixing being handled in the same month. In between that time period, an unmixed version of \"Violence (Enough Is Enough)\" was streamed from the band's website in December 2012. The band then embarked on the Right Back at It Again Tour in March 2013, performing the new song \"Right Back at It Again\" at each show. From mid-August to late-September, the band released webisodes to tie-in with the album. The band performed another song that would appear on the album, \"Dead & Buried\", at each stop of the following House Party Tour, beginning in September 2013 and ending a month later. A few months before the recording of the album started, in December 2011, the band was involved in a lawsuit with their label Victory, which had parts resolved a few days before the album's release. This lawsuit led to the band's initial digital self-release of the album on October 8, with a physical release following on November 25, featuring three bonus tracks. Common Courtesy charted at number 34 in the UK and number 37 in the U.S. and was met with generally favorable reviews, with critics praising the album's sound. \"Right Back at It Again\" charted at number 33 on the Alternative Songs and at number 40 on the Mainstream Rock Songs charts in the U.S, while \"End of Me\" charted at number 40 on Alternative Songs and at number 26 on Mainstream Rock Songs."@en ;

Bon Voyage is Koda's first album since her 2012 Japonesque, and her longest album in production since her 2008 studio album Kingdom. The album's production was handled by several music producers, such as Joseph Lawrence, Toby Gad, T-Sk, Mats Lie Skare, Figge Bosstrom, Tommy Henriksen, Badur Haberg, and Clarabell. It also features guest appearances from Sean Paul and OVDS, among others. Five different formats were released to promote the album; a standalone CD, a CD and DVD bundle, a CD and Blu-ray bundle, a fan package featuring a live DVD, and a digital release in Japan. Upon the album's release, it was met with favourable reviews from music critics. Critics highlight individual songs for their production and composition, and commended the singles. Bon Voyage became Koda's seventh studio album to reach the top spot on Japan's Oricon Albums Chart, but her first album to not ship over 100,000 units in that region. Because of this, it became her first studio album in failing to achieve a certification by the Recording Industry Association of Japan (RIAJ). Four singles were released from the album, including an EP. Koda promoted the album on her 2014 Bon Voyage concert tour."@en ;

The album was released on October 22, 2013, and the sextet is expected to tour in the summer of 2014. According to JazzTimes, this album deviates from Harrell's previous works. The use of piano is absent, and the three horns often play in block-chord formation. There are hints of Latin jazz, R&B and indie-rock. According to the review, \"Colors of a Dream may deviate, but it never disappoints.\" Down Beat magazine similarly noted the lack of piano, stating that the addition of Shaw on sax and Spalding on bass results in an \"opaque and varied\" soundscape. In March 2013, the group performed this work at the Village Vanguard which was broadcast live by NPR Music."@en ;

The album was produced by Ted Comerford and mastered by Jamie King. Mixing and \"gizmos and gadgets\" are credited to Fidelitorium founder Mitch Easter, established musician and producer of artists such as R.E.M. and Ben Folds Five, among others. Musically, Give Me Mine is similar to 2012's Soul Food with its grungy, garage rock exterior based in early contemporary music styles such as rock and roll and soul. Influenced heavily by various classic rock bands, Jonas Sees in Color blends vintage structure with a modern flare. According to music blog Planet Stereo, this attributes to creating an album that \"feels fresh, [but also] has a nostalgic feel to it.\""@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Random Access Memories is the fourth studio album by French electronic music duo Daft Punk. It was released on 17 May 2013 by the duo's imprint Daft Life, under exclusive license to Columbia Records. The album pays tribute to the late 1970s and early 1980s era of music in the United States, particularly the sounds that emerged from Los Angeles. This tribute was reflected in the gradual promotional rollout for the album that included billboards, television advertisements, and a web series. Unlike their previous studio albums, Daft Punk recruited session musicians to perform live instrumentation in professional recording locations, and limited the use of electronic instruments to drum machines, a custom-built modular synthesizer, and vintage vocoders. The album features collaborations with Giorgio Moroder, Panda Bear, Julian Casablancas, Todd Edwards, DJ Falcon, Chilly Gonzales, Nile Rodgers, Paul Williams, and Pharrell Williams. Random Access Memories received critical acclaim upon its release, scoring an 87 out of 100 on review aggregator site Metacritic and frequently appearing on music critics' year-end lists. It has also become one of Daft Punk's most commercially successful albums to date, topping the charts in more than 25 countries worldwide. It debuted at number-one on the Billboard 200 in the United States, selling more than 339,000 copies within its first week, becoming their highest charting album to date and their first to top the chart. The lead single, \"Get Lucky\", was a critical and commercial success worldwide, topping the charts in more than 30 countries worldwide and becoming one of the best-selling digital singles of all time. At the 56th Annual Grammy Awards in 2014, the album won Grammy Awards for Album of the Year, Best Dance/Electronica Album and Best Engineered Album, Non-Classical, and \"Get Lucky\" won for Record of the Year and Best Pop Duo/Group Performance."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"The Bones of What You Believe is the debut studio album by Scottish synthpop band Chvrches, released on 20 September 2013 by Virgin Records and Goodbye Records. Recorded between 2011 and 2013 in Glasgow, the album was written, composed, and produced by the band. It was made available as both a twelve-track standard edition and eighteen-track special version, the latter including two extra songs, two remixes and two live videos. The Bones of What You Believe received critical acclaim from contemporary music critics upon its release. According to frontwoman Lauren Mayberry, the album's title derives from a lyric in the song \"Strong Hand\" and refers to the raw \"creativity and effort\" that served as the skeleton for the album. Musically, The Bones of What You Believe is primarily a synthpop album that incorporates \"neon-Eighties\" influences. The Bones of What You Believe received positive reviews from music critics, with many complimenting Mayberry's vocal performance and Iain Cook and Martin Doherty's use of synthesisers and vocal loops. The album debuted at number nine on the UK Albums Chart, selling 12,415 copies in its first week. It also reached the top fifteen in Australia, Ireland and the United States, and the top twenty in Austria and Canada. The album spawned seven singles: \"The Mother We Share\", \"Recover\", \"Gun\", \"Lies\", \"We Sink\", \"Under the Tide\" and \"Tether\", with the lead single becoming a moderate commercial success, charting in the top ten in Belgium and Japan, as well as the top forty in the United Kingdom. It also peaked at number twelve on the Alternative Songs chart in the United States."@en ;

Drawing inspirations from the soundtracks to the features A Charlie Brown Christmas and White Christmas, as well as the Christmas albums by Mariah Carey, McEntire, and Phil Spector, they experimented on various styles and sounds using Spector's famed Wall of Sound technique to a create a contemporary holiday theme to classics. The Christmas music of Wrapped in Red comprises a variety of the genres such pop, jazz, country, and soul, marking a departure from the pop rock sound established from her previous studio albums; while its lyrics share a singular theme of the color red, which represents a plethora of emotions during the holidays.

	dbo:abstract	"E=MC\u00B2 is the eleventh studio album by American singer-songwriter Mariah Carey. It was released in the United States on April 15, 2008 by Island Records. The singer began recording the album in 2007 in Anguilla, after writing and composing most of its material during and after her 2006 Adventures of Mimi Tour. Carey worked with several notable songwriters and producers during the course of the project, including Jermaine Dupri, Bryan-Michael Cox, Stargate, The-Dream, Tricky Stewart, Scott Storch and Danja. The album revealed a more personal side of the singer, illustrated in its declarative theme of emancipation from her previous marriage, and from her personal and professional setbacks. Although it shared similar vocal production as well as an inclination to her signature pop and R&B ballads, the album also encompassed a variety of dance-oriented and uptempo styles. It was meant to be a continuation, or a second part of her tenth studio album, The Emancipation of Mimi (2005). Carey collaborated with a number of artists on the album, including T-Pain, Damian Marley and Young Jeezy. Though considered by critics very similar to the formula its predecessor had been built on, E=MC\u00B2 included other genres she had never explored, such as reggae, and her continued recording of gospel-influenced hymns. E=MC\u00B2 was generally well received by music critics, with many complimenting the record's broad genre influences, and musical and production styles. Some critics, however, felt that the album was too similar to The Emancipation of Mimi, and didn't offer anything new from the formula. The album debuted at number one on the US Billboard 200 with opening week sales of 463,000 copies; the highest first-week sales of Carey's career. It opened inside the top-five on the albums chart in Australia, Canada, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. The album achieved worldwide sales of over 2.5 million copies worldwide. Four singles were commission in promotion of the album. The album's lead single, \"Touch My Body\", became Carey's eighteenth chart topper on the Billboard Hot 100, making her the solo artist with the most number one singles in United States history, surpassing the record held by Elvis Presley. Additionally, it gave Carey her 79th week atop the chart, tying Presley for most weeks at number one. It achieved strong worldwide charting, peaking within the top five of the singles charts in Italy, Japan, New Zealand, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. \"Bye Bye\" served as the album's second release. Although hailed by critics, and expected to have achieved large commercial success, the song stalled at number nineteen on the Hot 100, and managed to chart weakly internationally. Both the third and fourth singles, \"I'll Be Lovin' U Long Time\" and \"I Stay in Love\" failed to garner success in any prominent music market."@en ;

To accompany the album, Art Brut have compiled a comic book version of Brilliant! Tragic! to be released at the same time. The tracklisting and release details were confirmed in early March 2011. Art Brut frontman Eddie Argos has already described Brilliant! Tragic! as his \"favourite\" Art Brut album, saying that it was definitely their \"greatest\" album so far. \"Bang Bang Rock & Roll did what it said on the tin\", Argos explained, \"It's A Bit Complicated was a bit complicated. On Art Brut vs. Satan we had to fight Satan. This one follows the same pattern, it is a 'brilliant, tragic', record. If it was a TV show you'd define it as a dramedy.\" On the subject matter for the album, Argos has said; \"This time the album is more about how I think I\u2019m psychic, songs for my funeral, the principality of Sealand and Axl Rose. Weightier topics I think. I\u2019m also sexier now\" He also comments on the band's current musical direction, stating that \"with the last album we'd just remembered we were a punk band again so it was all four to the floor rock out.

It was Fishbone's first studio album in three years following the departure of founding members Kendall Jones and Chris Dowd and the band being dropped by Sony Records. It was also their last album with founding member Philip \"Fish\" Fisher, who would eventually leave the band two years later. The band's recent experiences prompted the album's themes of racism and music industry practices, and Chim Chim's Badass Revenge includes some of the band's heaviest songs, such as the hardcore punk title track, \"Riot\" and \"Psychologically Overcast\" (the latter featuring guest vocals by Busta Rhymes). The album was produced by Dallas Austin, who said he wanted to take Fishbone to the next level as Rick Rubin had done with Red Hot Chili Peppers. In 1997, Austin would use Fishbone as the backing band for Amoeba Cleansing Syndrome, the second album by R&B singer Joi Gilliam. The Familyhood (Fishbone's Fans) have often also criticized the album for being poorly mixed both levelly and sonically. John Bigham, who'd joined the band during the tour for The Reality of My Surroundings makes his only solo guitar effort on this album, leaving shortly after the completion due to what was cited as \"lack of creative input\" and wanting to create a solo career. It has been heard that most of the lyrics for the entire album were in fact written by Walter Kibby. The song \"Alcoholic\" was written by Angelo Moore in his teenage years and was inspired by his uncle before the band was signed to Sony Records and appears on their original demo submitted to record labels. It was often live introduced by Angelo Moore as \"a song I wrote about my uncle... he's an alcoholic, and he makes me really mad... \" The album sold well in underground circles but only reached #158 on the Billboard Album Charts. It was the last Fishbone album for four years, as the band went through more personnel changes and record company woes.[citation needed]"@en ;

Included were 14 previously unreleased tracks such as French-language versions of hit songs, alternate stereo mixes and a live set from the Lewisham Odeon recorded 24 May 1968. Besides various mono and stereo mixes of tracks, previously released material excluded from the set were the alternate version of \"Stay\" from the 1988 UK The Hollies: Compacts for Pleasure CD and the longer Take 9 of \"Poison Ivy\" from their first Australian LP. The set was marketed as a moderately priced set, meaning that most of the tracks on this compilation were culled from earlier releases, resulting in a mix of mono and stereo tracks and the use of several different masterings dating back to 1997 when all of the Hollies early albums were issued as mono/stereo two-fers for EMI's 60th anniversary. The albums Stay with The Hollies, For Certain Because and Butterfly are presented in stereo here while In The Hollies Style, Hollies, Would You Believe? and Evolution are in mono.

Heavily influenced by the band's troop-entertaining trips to such places as the Falkland Islands and Bosnia, and (in JJ's words) \"life in general\", the tracks cover such topics as the ravages of war, religious conflicts, and failed relationships. In album includes the minimally-accompanied ballad \"In the End\". The album failed to reach the official UK Albums Chart, their first such release to do so."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Desert Wind is a 1989 album by Ofra Haza, who was one of the most popular singers in Israel at the time. Haza was unknown in the rest of the world until the previous year when the song \"Im Nin'Alu\" and the following album Shaday were released, bringing her to the attention of Europe and the United States. Desert Wind was therefore more oriented toward the international market. The main language of the album is in English, however Ofra also sings in Arabic, Hebrew, and the ancient language of Aramaic. The album has a very oriental feeling, since it contains ancient Yemenite songs. The sound is a mainstream form of dance music with elements of synthpop and, on track 8, an influence of house music. The album ends with \"Kaddish,\" a Jewish prayer that, as Haza writes, is meant to hold all the world's sorrows on the wings of an angel. The song has a short English-language introduction. However, the main part of the prayer is in Aramaic."@en ;
