It was released by Parlophone in the UK on 29 March 2004 and by Nettwerk in the US on 4 May 2004. Two singles were released from the album in the UK: \"Come Home Billy Bird\", which features former Kenickie vocalist Lauren Laverne (now a BBC 6 Music DJ) on vocals, and the album's title track. Neil Hannon was the only member of The Divine Comedy by this point, as the band had split up shortly after the release of 2001's Regeneration. Hannon had decided to continue using the Divine Comedy name for this album. He was aided by long-time collaborator Joby Talbot, who arranged and conducted the orchestra. The album was recorded at RAK Studios and Konk Studios in London by Guy Massey, with help from Raj Das and Chris Bolster. It was mixed at Mayfair Studios by Nigel Godrich, who was assisted by Dan Grech-Marguerat."@en ;

All but one track appeared on the album Queen; the exception is \"Ogre Battle\" which appeared on Queen II. However, the versions featured on At the Beeb are different from the original versions, being closer to the songs as performed live. This is most notable on \"Ogre Battle\", as it starts right away with its riff (without any long intro), does not have any effects that the version on Queen II has and sounds much less polished. The BBC version of \"Ogre Battle\" did originally have a long intro featuring a grand guitar build up. It was not used for this release, allegedly because the original tape was damaged."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Cole World: The Sideline Story is the debut studio album by American rapper J. Cole. The album was released on September 27, 2011 under Dreamville Records and Roc Nation with distribution from Sony Music. The album is his first studio release, following three successful mixtapes. Production was handled mainly by Cole himself, with some production from high-profile producer No I.D. It includes features from Trey Songz, Drake, Jay-Z, and Missy Elliott. The album debuted at number one on the US Billboard 200 chart, with 218,000 units sold in the first week following its release. The album has since been certified Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). The album was one of the most anticipated releases of 2011 due to the sharp rise in Cole's popularity and mainstream fan base. Cole's lyrics perhaps most strikingly deal with issues such as abortion and the consequences of growing up in a fatherless household. However, these themes are incorporated alongside more introspective issues such as relationships, family problems, fame and attempting to be successful - an area which very much links in with the subtitle of the album 'The Sideline Story'. Upon its release, the album was generally well received by critics, who praised the wholesomeness of the album."@en ;

Frontman Ed Roland has considered Collective Soul the band's true debut album; Hints, Allegations, and Things Left Unsaid was intended more as a promotional demo and a means of acquiring a publishing contract for Roland who in 1995 noted, \"It's so funny for people to compare the two.

	dbo:abstract	"Eden is the sixth album by English soprano Sarah Brightman, released in 1998 under license by Nemo Studios to Angel Records. Similar to Brightman's later album La Luna, Eden juxtaposed English popular songs with Italian opera arias. This was a departure from her previous albums which were almost entirely sung in English, such as Fly. Eden retained elements of Timeless, which had strongest classical influences. Eden contains one classical rock ballad, \"Dust in the Wind\". It was released as a single and experienced a big success in Brazil, because it was featured on the soundtrack of the soap opera Andando nas Nuvens (Walking on the Clouds). The single \"Deliver Me\" also gained certain mainstream American success because of its inclusion on the soundtrack of the 1999 film Brokedown Palace. Subsequent to the release of Eden, Brightman performed her first world tour ever, One Night In Eden Tour, and released the VHS/DVD One Night in Eden."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Erasure was the seventh studio album by Erasure, released in 1995. It was produced by Thomas Fehlmann (of The Orb) and Gareth Jones. An overtly experimental and introspective album, Erasure contains eleven, mostly mid-tempo tracks that differed from their past output of shiny, three-minute pop songs. Most tracks clocked in at five minutes or more, several contained long synth interludes, and guest artists included the London Community Gospel Choir and performance artist Diamanda Gal\u00E1s. Although appreciated for its experimental nature, Erasure marked the beginning of Erasure's slide from the peak of their popularity in the mainstream music world.[citation needed] Coming off four consecutive number-one albums in the UK, this album failed to hit the top ten and two single releases also missed the UK top ten. After a successful top twenty debut on the Billboard 200 for their previous album I Say I Say I Say, Erasure debuted and peaked at number eighty-two in the U.S. and generated no Hot 100 singles. In Germany the album also peaked lower than previous albums, at number eighty-seven. Some polls have shown this album to be a favourite among fans of the band. In an interview with DJ Ron Slomowicz circa 2006, Erasure was asked for their favourite album from their own catalogue. Bell stated \"It's a toss-up between \"Chorus\" and the self-titled \"Erasure\" album from 1995.\""@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Fast, Cheap and Out of Control is the 2008 follow-up album to HK119's 2006 eponymous debut. The album was released through One Little Indian Records on 28 September 2008 in the United Kingdom. The album was a significant upgrade from the harsher, lo-fi sounding debut. Having started to collaborate with other producers, musicians and writers (including cult folk singer Mara Carlyle who provides backing vocals to the track 'Divine'), 'Fast, Cheap and Out of Control' is considered a much glossier, finer and intricately executed collection of electro pop songs, that still continue HK119's analysis on issues such as humanity, cloning, celebrity culture, global warming and civil rights, all delivered in a thoroughly researched, but highly tongue-in-cheek and digestible manner. The imagery of the album's artwork and HK119 herself had also changed considerably for this album. In bringing the album \"Back down to earth\" and \"from a more personal place\", HK119 used the imagery of sportswear and use of such related equipment as a dumbbell to highlight the competitive nature of humanity (while also seen smoking on the cover sleeve, to represent the conflict of \"what does it mean to be human?\"; a line featured in the album's lead single, \"C'est La Vie\".) As with her previous album, HK119 produced a short series of home-made music videos to coincide with the album. As the tracks on 'Fast, Cheap and Out of Control' were longer and more finely produced than before, there were only five coinciding videos with the album (unlike 11 videos that were made for the debut album.) These videos featured HK119's humorous experiments with Chroma Key (aka: Greenscreen) video production. HK119 and One Little Indian Records made the album's tracks available in individual parts on HK119s official website as part of a remix challenge, for people to make alternative versions of the tracks to potentially be later releases as their own remix album. The resulting release, Fast And Cheap Mixes, is a collection of electronica themed remixes by a collective of artists on the Bit-Phalanx netlabel based in London. Fast And Cheap Mixes was released digitally through One Little Indian Records in April 2010. Additionally, Bit-Phalanx have released two free bonus EPs of additional remixes of \"C'est La Vie\" and \"Space Pt.1\" through their official website."@en ;

The album was released in 1984 and reissued in 1998 with seven bonus tracks. The title of the album was taken from a line of dialogue in an episode of The Honeymooners. MCA Records had trouble pulling a successful single from the album. They released two music videos for the songs \"I Need Someone\" and \"I Love You Love Me Love\" (its title shortened to \"I Love You Love\"), but only \"I Love You Love\" was released in the 7-inch format (backed with a live version of \"Talkin' 'Bout My Baby\"). In the UK, \"I Need Someone\" was released as a 12-inch single, but the vocal differed from the album version. \"Cherry Bomb\" was remixed by Mark S. Berry and released as a promotional 12-inch single in the US on red vinyl, coupled with an instrumental titled \"Bombs Away\". The record sleeve featured Jett firing up a large plastic cherry with a Bic lighter. \"Hide and Seek\" and \"I Can't Control Myself\" were produced by Thom Panunzio and Kenny Laguna. Both originally appeared on the Venezuelan release of the Glorious Results of a Misspent Youth album (which was titled I Need Someone for that country). \"Bird Dog\" was produced by Kenny Laguna. It originally appeared as the B-side of the British 12\" single, \"I Need Someone\". \"Talkin' 'Bout My Baby\" was produced by John Aiosa and Kenny Laguna.

	dbo:abstract	"Holographic Universe is the third full-length studio album by Swedish metal band Scar Symmetry. It is the last album to feature vocalist Christian \u00C4lvestam, who parted ways with the band shortly after the album's completion. It was released on 20 June 2008 in Europe, and on July 7, 2008 in North America. The album peaked on the charts at 37 in Finland, and 65 in Austria. A music video for the song \"Morphogenesis\" premiered on 18 September. The album is rumoured to be loosely based on Michael Talbot's book The Holographic Universe.[citation needed] Upon its release, the science-themed Holographic Universe was considered Scar Symmetry's most commercially focused album, with critics drawing comparisons with progressive bands including Dream Theater. Allmusic comments that the band \"appears more serious than ever about contrasting super melodic choruses, guitar harmonies, and even intermittent synths, against aesthetic evil twins like furious death metal growls, aggressive riffing, and torrential drumming\". Blabbermouth.net claims the album does not dramatically expand on previous releases, but is a \"well-planned and structured album that comes across as accessible and heavy at the same time\". \"The Three Dimensional Shadow\" was the first Scar Symmetry song to feature the use of an 8 string guitar. A thirteenth track, \"Disintergrate the Hourglass\", was written for the album, but was removed when the final track list was made.[citation needed]"@en ;

Inspired by the release options available in the Internet age, the band members made the album available for purchase on their website as a digital download on 21 August 2008. Minimal promotion was undertaken in the UK. The record was released in compact disc form on 24 October 2008, with Wichita Recordings as the primary label. It peaked at number 8 on the UK Albums Chart and entered the Billboard 200 in the United States at number 18. Bloc Party wanted to create an album that further distanced the band from the traditional rock set-up by incorporating more electronic elements and unconventional musical arrangements. As the record's title suggests, its tracks are about personal relationships and are loosely based on one of frontman Kele Okereke's break-ups in 2007. Three songs were released as singles: \"Mercury\", \"Talons\", and \"One Month Off\"; the first two tracks entered the UK Top 40. Intimacy was generally well received by critics.

dbr:Le_Fil	rdf:type	schema:MusicAlbum ;
	dbo:abstract	"Le Fil is the second album by French singer Camille. The title translates as \"The Thread\". The album features a 'tone', a low-level drone that is in the background of every song, which Camille has described as 'her note'. The note is a B. The singer also mentioned that many people returned the record, thinking this sound was a fault with the recording. The title also arises due to the similar word 'fille' or girl which arises in a lot of the songs. It was first released in 2005, and reissued in 2006 in the United States, the UK and Australia with four extra tracks. The final track on the original version, \"Quand je marche\", runs for close to 39 minutes. The actual song is only four minutes in duration, but the tone extends for over 30 minutes after it has ended. The final 30 seconds contain Camille speaking in French. This extended ending was cut from reissues featuring bonus tracks. It has been most frequently compared to Bj\u00F6rk's Med\u00FAlla, for Camille's use of her voice as an instrument in innovative ways. In 2008, the eighth track on Le Fil, \"Senza\", was used by Ford in televised adverts for their Kuga SUV. The advert premiered at half time of the 2008 UEFA Champions League Final, opening up a new Pan-European audience to Camille's work. It has continued to air on networks across Europe throughout Euro 2008. In 2010, the track \"Ta douleur\" was featured in the Saturday Night Live sketch \"Les Jeunes de Paris\"."@en ;

A deluxe re-issue of the album was released in April 2014. The title track \"Leprosy\" was covered by the blackened death metal band Akercocke on their 2007 album Antichrist. Dutch melodic death metal band Callenish Circle covered \"Pull the Plug\" as a bonus on their Flesh Power Dominion album, released in 2002; shortly thereafter, Norwegians Zyklon also recorded \"Pull the Plug\" to be used as a bonus track.

The album is known for featuring the popular song, \"Return of the Mack\" which spent a remarkable forty-one weeks on the Billboard charts. Upon its release Return of the Mack received mixed reviews from music critics, who praised Morrison's strong voice and entertaining songs, but described the album as having weak production. The album spent thirty-eight weeks on the UK Albums Chart where it debuted and peaked at number four, and has since been certified platinum by BPI. On the US Billboard 200 chart, the album reached a peak of seventy-six, however, it would eventually be certified platinum by RIAA due to the success of the lead single there, \"Return of the Mack\". The album has since sold over 3 million copies worldwide. The album would make Morrison the first artist in British pop history to have five top 10 singles from a debut album to chart on the UK Singles Chart. These included \"Let's Get Down\", \"Return of the Mack\", \"Crazy (Remix)\", \"Trippin'\", \"Horny\" and \"Moan and Groan\". The first single \"Crazy\" became a top 20 hit in the UK; a remix was also released, which peaked at number six in the UK. When \"Return of the Mack\" was released in spring 1996, it would become an international hit, spending two weeks at number one on the UK Singles Chart and one week at number two on the US Billboard Hot 100. The song was listed at #8 on the Billboard year-end chart for 1997 and was certified platinum by the RIAA. Morrison became the first black male solo artist to reach number one on the UK Singles Chart in the 1990s. In 1997, he received four Brit Awards nominations, a Mercury Prize nomination, an MTV Europe Music Awards nomination, and five Music of Black Origin Awards (MOBO) nominations.

Gallagher, best known as guitarist, main songwriter and occasional vocalist of English Britpop band Oasis played a set composing of primarily Oasis songs and was joined by fellow Oasis musician Gem Archer on guitar for the performance. The album's title stems from a lyric in the Oasis song \"Fade Away\", and Gallagher-penned Oasis songs make up the bulk of the songs recorded on the album. Past collaborator and friend of Gallagher Paul Weller (formerly of The Jam/Style Council) joined Gallagher on stage for two songs during the performance, too. Five of the songs were released over the course of five days as free downloads on iTunes, followed by a physical CD give-away with The Sunday Times, which contained another eleven recordings from the performance. The album, with the additional five tracks previously released on iTunes, then went on sale digitally in the UK in its entirety the following day. The American iTunes eventually released it on 5 May 2009. The album was ineligible to chart on the Official UK Album Chart due to the absence of a commercially sold physical release."@en ;

At the time of its release it was considered the band's most accessible album and came when the band were experiencing unprecedented recognition in the media. It entered the UK album charts at number 9. The album features covers of the Sister Sledge disco track \"Lost in Music\" and of Steve Bent's \"I'm Going to Spain\", an obscure song which Bent performed on the British talent show New Faces in 1974 (Bent's version was included on The World's Worst Record album, compiled by disc jockey Kenny Everett in 1978). The CD edition of The Infotainment Scan also includes \"Why Are People Grudgeful?\", the only track to be released as a single (albeit in a different version). It is based on two reggae songs: \"People Grudgeful\" by Joe Gibbs and \"People Funny Boy\" by Lee \"Scratch\" Perry. Of the original compositions on The Infotainment Scan, \"Glam-Racket\" drew much attention for its alleged criticism of Britpop band Suede, with the lyric \"you are entrenched in suede\". At the time, Suede were regarded as a \"nouveau glam rock\" band. \"The League of Bald-Headed Men\", meanwhile \u2013 identified variously as a \"jokey conspiracy theory\" and a \"diatribe against gerontocracy\" \u2014 appears to borrow its riff from Led Zeppelin's \"Misty Mountain Hop\", despite claims by Fall front man Mark E. Smith that he had never heard the band's music. A remix of \"The League of Bald-Headed Men\", retitled \"League Moon Monkey Mix\", is also included on the CD edition. \"Paranoia Man in Cheap Shit Room\" adapts its title from Nervous Man in a Four Dollar Room, an episode of The Twilight Zone.

The combination of Kory Clarke's acidic lyrics and new guitarist XFactor's (aka Gene Poole, aka Alex) punk-tinged buzz-tone created a fresh new sound, dubbed Acid Punk. The British influence of XFactor's hard-driving guitar gave Clarke what might have been the perfect backdrop for his brilliant rants. Mixed by Ben Grosse, the album sold well in Europe but was not promoted in the US. For reasons never explained, XFactor left. Rumours of a rift followed. XFactor still refuses to discuss why he left. Shortly after, the band broke up. Following the dissolution of Warrior Soul in 1995, singer Kory Clarke formed a new band with the name Space Age Playboys.

	dbo:abstract	"Too Tough to Die is the eighth studio album by the American punk rock band the Ramones. It was released on October 1, 1984, and is the first Ramones record to feature Richie Ramone on drums. With ex-member Tommy Ramone producing, the recording process was similar to that of the band's 1976 debut album, Ramones. Likewise, the record's style\u2014both lyrically and compositionally\u2014saw the band returning to their roots. The photograph on the album cover, which features silhouettes of the band members, resulted from a \"lucky accident\" after photographer George DuBose's camera malfunctioned. The album's overall style leaned toward that of hardcore punk and heavy metal music, rather than pop music which had been a focus of several of the band's previous albums. Too Tough to Die borrows and improves upon elements such as guitar riffs from 1983's Subterranean Jungle. For the second time, after \"Time Bomb\" on Subterranean Jungle, bassist Dee Dee Ramone performs lead vocals on the album and receives vocal credits for two tracks. The album also contains the band's only instrumental piece, \"Durango 95\". Critics appreciated the band's return to earlier methods of writing, recording, and production, noting they had strayed from the pop music genre. Despite critical acclaim, Too Tough to Die performed poorly in album sales. At this point in their career, the album was the band's lowest peaking record on the Billboard 200."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Trouble in Paradise is the seventh album by American composer Randy Newman. Released four years after his last commercial album, 1979's Born Again, and two years after he composed the original score for the 1981 film Ragtime, it was well-received as a return to form.[citation needed] It spawned the hit \"I Love L.A.\", and included a duet with Paul Simon on \"The Blues.\" The album was different from previous Newman albums, full of synthesizers, drum loops, and samples. The writing also somewhat abandoned the country-tinged folkiness of his work in the 1970s in favor of somewhat glossy synth pop.[citation needed] Trouble in Paradise was ranked as number 67 on Rolling Stone's 100 Greatest Albums of the 80s list. A cover version of \"Real Emotional Girl\" by the Canadian singer Patricia O'Callaghan appears on her 2001 album Real Emotional Girl."@en ;

It also helped establish his membership in the legendary hip hop crew D.I.T.C., which includes Lord Finesse, Showbiz & A.G., Diamond D, Fat Joe, Big L and Buckwild, who produced the majority of this album. The album is now out of print. The album is most remembered because of the single \"Time's Up\". The instrumental to the track was used in the movie 8 Mile, starring rapper Eminem, in a rap battle scene. The song was a scathing accusation, pointed at thug-posturers who were flooding the hip hop scene at the time. Vocal clips from the song have been sampled in numerous hip hop tracks throughout the years; including Mos Def's song \"Hip Hop\" off of his 1999 album Black on Both Sides and Big L's song \"The Enemy\", which appears on his posthumous album The Big Picture."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Live & Loud is a live album recorded by then former Black Sabbath singer Ozzy Osbourne, released on 28 June 1993. At the time, it was to be Osbourne's final album following Osbourne's final tour before retiring, aptly titled \"No More Tours\". The track \"Black Sabbath\" featured the original line-up of Black Sabbath, the members of which were invited to join Ozzy as guest stars for the Costa Mesa Reunion shows. In addition to the standard release in a 'fat-boy' 2CD case, the album was released as a digipak with a metal 'speaker grille' cover and included tattoos, as well as the booklet; the official release was preceded by a single CD sampler issued as a promotional item. A DVD of Live & Loud was also issued, one of the very first music compilation released in that format. The DVD is a compilation of live footage from several shows rather than a single concert: this is evident as Osbourne can be seen both shirtless and wearing different clothes during the same song, while guitarist Zakk Wylde can be seen playing up to three different guitars in the same song. The album, along with The Ultimate Sin and Just Say Ozzy, has since been deleted from Ozzy's catalog and was not remastered and reissued along with the rest of Ozzy's albums in 2002. This is mainly due to a continuing legal struggle with bassist/songwriter Phil Soussan over the song \"Shot in the Dark\", present in the three albums. Despite this, the live track \"I Don't Want to Change the World\" appeared on \"The Ozzman Cometh\" and The Essential Ozzy Osbourne compilations. Copies of the 1995 remastered CDs are still available on Amazon.com. Osbourne won a Grammy Award for the version of \"I Don't Want to Change the World\" included in this album."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"The Ozzman Cometh is a compilation album by British heavy metal singer Ozzy Osbourne released in 1997. It is his third greatest hits collection. Its initial, limited edition 2-CD pressing contained five previously unreleased songs. Versions released in 2002 and later have only one disc, and the song \"Shot in the Dark\" is replaced by \"Miracle Man\". This was due to a legal action brought about by the song's co-writer, Phil Soussan, for unpaid royalties. The tracks \"Black Sabbath\", \"War Pigs\", \"Fairies Wear Boots\", and \"Behind the Wall of Sleep\" were performed by Osbourne previous band Black Sabbath, during a session for the BBC Radio 1 Sunday show \"The John Peel Sessions\", conducted by British DJ John Peel and dated 26 April 1970. \"Fairies Wear Boots\" and \"War Pigs\" are early versions of tracks that would finally be recorded on the band's second album Paranoid and thus have different lyrics. The interview found on the second disc is from 1988, where Osbourne speaks about his latest album at the time (No Rest for the Wicked), about his new guitarist Zakk Wylde and his past days in Black Sabbath. Note on versions post-2002: The album tracks are from the 2002 remasters, for which Blizzard of Ozz and Diary of a Madman were partially re-recorded. The original drum and bass tracks were replaced with recordings by Osbourne's then-current bassist Robert Trujillo and drummer Mike Bordin, as a management response to legal action by original bassist Bob Daisley and drummer Lee Kerslake for unpaid royalty fees. Note also the deliberate misspelling of Daisley's and Soussan's names in this CD's sleeve notes: 'Bob Daisy', 'Bill Susan', as well as Rudy Sarzo's - 'Trudy Sarzo'. The tracks from Bark at the Moon are the original recordings, but later mixes of the songs. The compilation won a 1997 Metal Edge Readers' Choice Award for Best Hits or Compilation Album."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Workingman's Dead is the fifth album by the rock band the Grateful Dead. It was recorded in February 1970 and originally released on June 14, 1970. The album and it's studio follow-up, American Beauty, were recorded back-to-back using a similar style, eschewing the psychedelic experimentation of previous albums and focusing on Americana-styled songcraft. In 2003, the album was ranked number 262 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time. It was reissued in 2003 in three different formats: as part of the The Golden Road (1965\u20131973) 12-CD box set, as a remastered and expanded CD, and as a DVD-audio release. The first two contain eight exclusive tracks not found on the original 1970 release while the latter contains just the original tracks rendered in DVD-Audio. In 2014, it was reissued as a two-LP set mastered at 45 rpm by Mobile Fidelity Sound Lab."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Days of Future Passed is the second album and first concept album by English rock band The Moody Blues, released in November 1967 by Deram Records. After two years performing as a struggling white R&B band, The Moody Blues were asked by their record label in September 1967 to record an adaptation of Anton\u00EDn Dvo\u0159\u00E1k's Symphony No. 9 as a stereo demonstration record. Instead, the band chose to record an orchestral song cycle about a typical working day. Recording sessions for the album took place at Decca Studios in West Hampstead, London between 9 May and 3 November 1967. The band worked with record producer Tony Clarke, engineer Derek Varnals and conductor Peter Knight. The album's music features psychedelic rockers, ballads by singer-songwriter and guitarist Justin Hayward, Mellotron played by keyboardist Mike Pinder and orchestral accompaniment by the London Festival Orchestra. Music writers cite the album as a precursor to progressive rock music. Bill Holdship of Yahoo! Music remarks that the band \"created an entire genre here.\" David Fricke cites it as one of the essential albums of 1967 and finds it \"closer to high-art pomp than psychedelia. But there is a sharp pop discretion to the writing and a trippy romanticism in the mirroring effect of the strings and Mike Pinder's Mellotron.\" Will Hermes cites the album as an essential progressive rock record and opines that its use of the Mellotron, a tape replay keyboard, made it a \"signature\" element of the genre. An influential work of the counterculture period, Allmusic editor Bruce Eder calls the album \"one of the defining documents of the blossoming psychedelic era, and one of the most enduringly popular albums of its era.\""@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Hall of the Mountain King is the fourth studio album by the American heavy metal band Savatage, released in 1987 under the direction of producer Paul O'Neill. It is their first album produced by O'Neill, who was assigned to the band after the tour in support of Fight for the Rock. This album shows the beginning of Savatage's exploration of progressive metal, in their search for new forms of musical expression. Many fans consider this album the original turning point in their musical identity, distinguishing between the old and new Savatage. It is not a concept album, but it has a constant tone (of darkness, in this case) and is more complex than their previous albums, with two entirely instrumental tracks that go beyond simple guitar riffs and solos, namely \"Prelude to Madness\" and \"Last Dawn\". Through Paul O'Neill's connections, he brought in Ray Gillen of Badlands fame (credited as Ray Gillian) to perform a vocal duet at the end of \"Strange Wings\". \"Prelude to Madness\" is an arrangement of Grieg's \"In the Hall of the Mountain King\" from the Peer Gynt suite. Oddly, Grieg is not credited for this song, but for the following title track - which ironically, is an original song. The intro of \"Prelude to Madness\" features keyboards and guitar playing \"Mars, the Bringer of War\" from Gustav Holst's suite, The Planets. This was the first album to feature the album cover drawn by artist Gary Smith, who was responsible for lead guitarist Criss Oliva's airbrushed guitars at the time. Hall of the Mountain King reached position No. 116 in the US Billboard 200 albums chart."@en ;

The 18 minute film was directed by Dr. Dre and Fab Five Freddy and chronicles the fictional death of Snoop Dogg and his resurrection after making a deal with the Devil. The film's title comes from Snoop's song of the same name from his debut album, Doggystyle, which was released a year earlier. The single \"What Would You Do\" was included on the Natural Born Killers soundtrack and was nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group in the 38th Annual Grammy Awards in 1996. The album was re-released with a bonus DVD containing 3 music videos on July 11, 2006. Tupac Shakur was paid $200,000 by Death Row Records owner Suge Knight to record a track for the album. The track was recorded but it was not used on the official soundtrack release. The rumored recording is debated between the song \"Pain\" which was later used for the Above The Rim soundtrack, \"High Til I Die Interscope Version\", which was later re-recorded for the Sunset Park album while 2Pac was on Death Row Records, and the Unreleased Version Of R U Still Down. R U Still Down is similar to the version that was released on the 1997 2Pac album \"R U Still Down\".

The album included Jackson singles that reportedly reached number 1 in charts around the world. The album also features the last original single released during Jackson's lifetime,\"One More Chance\" on November 20, 2003. Number Ones was successful around the world, originally reaching number 1 in the UK and number 13 in the United States. It proved to be an enduring catalog seller, eventually returning to the top spot in the UK and US charts in 2009 after Jackson's sudden death. It stayed as the number one selling album in the United States for six non consecutive weeks and for twenty-seven weeks on the Top Pop Catalog Albums chart. However, as a 'catalog' title, Number Ones was excluded from the Billboard 200 denying Jackson a seventh solo No. 1 album on the chart. The rules preventing titles older than 18 months to chart in the Billboard 200 were subsequently changed in the fall of 2009 due to the posthumous success of Jackson and The Beatles re-mastered re-releases.

It was issued on Modular Recordings and produced by The Avalanches' members Robbie Chater and Darren Seltmann (under the pseudonym Bobbydazzler). The album uses sampling extensively, containing an estimated 3,500 samples from various genres of music. The album was created in two separate near-identical studios by Chater and Seltmann, exchanging audio mixes of records they sampled. After the album's positive reception in Australia, the duo considered an international release \u2013 its date was held back until 2001 in both the United Kingdom and North America and appeared in slightly altered forms. The delay and changes occurred so that the group could obtain permission to use the samples or use replacements. Five singles were released on the album, \"Electricity\", \"Frontier Psychiatrist\", \"Since I Left You\", \"Radio\" and \"A Different Feeling\". The group promoted the album by organizing headlining tours in Australia, Europe and the United States.

	dbo:abstract	"Songs from the Wood is the tenth studio album by Jethro Tull, released February 1977. The album signalled a new direction for the band who turned to celebrating British pagan folklore and the countryside life in a wide-ranging folk rock style which combined traditional instruments and melodies with hard rock drums and electric guitars. The album is considered to be the first of a trio of folk rock albums: Songs from the Wood, Heavy Horses (1978) and Stormwatch (1979). On the album cover appears an extended title line: \"Jethro Tull\u2014with kitchen prose, gutter rhymes and divers\u2014Songs from the Wood.\" The title track of the album contain two of these phrases in its lyrics. The UK music-paper adverts read:\"Jethro Tull present 'Songs From The Wood'. A new album of Old Magic. Songs From The Wood. It's inspired by the thought that perhaps nature isn't as gentle as we'd like to believe. And it takes as its theme the natural and supernatural inhabitants of the woodlands of old England. Warm and friendly, harsh and bitter by turns, it includes 'Ring Out Solstice Bells' as well as Tull's new single 'The Whistler' and seven other songs. Find a quiet spot and listen to it soon.\" The 2003 remastered edition includes a pair of bonus tracks, featuring a live rendition of \"Velvet Green.\""@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Spirit of Eden is the fourth album by the English New wave band Talk Talk, released in 1988 on Parlophone records. The album found neither critical acclaim nor commercial success on release, but has gained cult-status and is today considered highly influential. The songs were mostly written by vocalist Mark Hollis and producer Tim Friese-Greene. The album was compiled from a lengthy recording process at London's Wessex Studios between 1987 and 1988. Often working in darkness, the band recorded many hours of improvised performances which were heavily edited and re-arranged into an album in mostly digital format. The songs contain elements of rock, jazz, classical and ambient music. Critics often view Spirit of Eden as a departure from Talk Talk's earlier and more accessible albums. Compared to their 1986 hit The Colour of Spring, it was a commercial disappointment. It received mostly lukewarm or negative reviews on release, but has since become an influence in the development of a number of later alternative rock musicians and subgenres."@en ;

Standing on the Shoulder of Giants has been certified double platinum by the British Phonographic Industry and has sold around 208,000 copies in the US. In 1999, the year preceding the final release of this album, Alan McGee closed Creation Records and Oasis had lost two founding members (Paul \"Bonehead\" Arthurs and Paul \"Guigsy\" McGuigan) and hired a new producer (Mark Stent) to replace Owen Morris. The album is an effective modern psychedelic record complete with drum loops, samples, electric sitar, mellotron, synthesizers and backward guitars, resulting in an album more experimental with electronica and heavy psychedelic rock influences. Songs such as \"Go Let It Out\", the Indian-influenced \"Who Feels Love?\", and the progressive \"Gas Panic!\" were a departure from the band's earlier style."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"The Lexicon of Love is the RIAA Gold-certified debut album by the British new wave band ABC, released in 1982. It is not a concept album, but features repeated themes in which the singer experiences heartache as he tries and fails to have a meaningful relationship. It was produced by Trevor Horn, engineered by Gary Langan, and featured orchestrations by Anne Dudley and Fairlight CMI programming by JJ Jeczalik; Horn, Langan, Dudley and Jeczalik would later form the Art of Noise. Indeed, most of the production team and sessions players listed below would form the basis for the ZTT label, and their work with Horn meant all concerned would be in constant demand throughout the industry in years to come. \"Tears Are Not Enough\" (in its initial release produced by Steve Brown), \"All of My Heart\", \"Poison Arrow\", and \"The Look of Love (Part One)\" were all Top 20 hits in the UK; the latter two also charted in the US, peaking at No. 25 and No. 14 respectively. The album reached No. 1 on the British charts, and peaked at No. 24 in the US charts. In 2004, a deluxe 2-disc reissue including previously unreleased outtakes and early demos and a live performance of the album from 1982 was released on the Neutron label. In 2009, ABC performed the album integrally at the Royal Albert Hall in London, accompanied by the BBC Concert Orchestra, and conducted by arranger and composer Anne Dudley. They were joined on stage by album producer Trevor Horn. The Lexicon of Love was again performed live in its entirety on 18 December 2012 at Theatre Royal Drury Lane. This marked the 30th anniversary of the album's release and once again featured Dudley as conductor, performing with the Southbank Sinfonia Orchestra. The same line-up (with Dudley and Southbank Sinfonia) concluded a four-date mini-tour at this same venue on 30 March 2014 performing the complete album. Martin Fry and band were once more accompanied by the Southbank Sinfonia Orchestra for dates at Liverpool\u2019s Philharmonic Hall, Glasgow\u2019s Royal Concert Hall, Sheffield City Hall, the Theatre Royal Drury Lane in London, and Birmingham Symphony Hall, between November 4th and 9th, 2015."@en ;

It was the first Wu-Tang solo album released after the group's debut, Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers). Similar to all first generation solo Wu-Tang projects, Tical was mainly produced by group member RZA, who provided a dark, murky and rugged sound. The album features guest appearances from RZA, Raekwon, Inspectah Deck, as well as several affiliates who would later appear on future group projects. The album's title \"Tical\" is a slang term for a blunt that has been laced with an adulterant, typically a sweetener or another psychoactive substance. The album title is also a play on the word \"methodical\". Tical was a commercial success, reaching number four on the Billboard 200, and number one on the Top R&B/Hip Hop Albums chart. On January 18, 1995, the album was certified gold in sales by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), and on July 13, 1995, it was certified platinum after sales of one million copies. This success was driven by its two singles, \"Bring the Pain\" and \"I'll Be There for You/You're All I Need to Get By\". The album has since been hailed by several music critics as a classic hip hop album. Its success is matched by its influence as a major piece in the East coast hip hop renaissance."@en ;

However, there are reports of Jourgensen saying in the 1980s that when he discovered hardcore music, his musical direction changed. Additionally, video of local concerts Ministry performed in Chicago 1\u20132 years previous to their signing with Arista show the band dressed in \"new wave\" styles and playing new wave and synthpop music. Jourgensen assumes a false English accent for all of the songs, for which he also later expressed great disliking, though his ex-wife stated in a 2013 interview: With Sympathy was also released as Work for Love under BMG in Europe (with the same cover). There is a video available for \"Revenge,\" which was one of three singles pulled from the album, the others being \"Work for Love\" and \"I Wanted to Tell Her.\" The album was long out of print and Jourgensen claimed for years that he had destroyed the master tapes. However, it was reissued in 2012 on Eastworld records with three bonus tracks.

It was the first of four Joel albums to top the Billboard charts and earned him two Grammys (for a total of four). Three songs reached the Top 40 in the United States, contributing to the album's success: \"My Life\" (#3), \"Big Shot\" (#14), and \"Honesty\" (#24). It was similarly well received by critics, earning the 1979 Grammy for Album of the Year. This Grammy was presented to its producer, Phil Ramone. Upon Ramone's death, 52nd Street's Album of the Year Grammy was passed on to Joel. Allmusic praises Joel for expanding stylistically on 1977's The Stranger, describing 52nd Street as \"more sophisticated and somewhat jazzy.\" (Jazz trumpeter Freddie Hubbard guests on \"Zanzibar\".) The title is a reference to 52nd Street, which was one of New York City's jazz centers in the middle of the century. Joel's label was headquartered on 52nd Street (in the CBS Building) at the time of the album's release. The studio in which 52nd Street was recorded was also on 52nd Street, a block away from the CBS Building. On October 1, 1982, 52nd Street became the first album to be commercially released on compact disc by Sony Music Entertainment when it went on sale in Japan. In 2003, the album was ranked number 352 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Against the Law is the fifth release, and fifth studio album, from the Christian metal band Stryper, released on August 21, 1990 (see 1990 in music). Three singles/video were released for this album including \"Shining Star\", \"Two Time Woman\" and \"Lady\" but received minimal airplay. This album marked a radical change in the musical and visual direction of the band. Gone were the yellow and black spandex outfits, the bold evangelical lyrics and the familiar yellow-and-black band logo with Isaiah 53:5. In their place were leather outfits, and lyrics more focused on rock n' roll and relationships, although arguably from a Christian worldview. The album was praised by many critics as the band's strongest work to date, but a large percentage of Stryper's Christian fanbase felt betrayed by this unannounced creative metamorphosis, and many of them accused Stryper of selling out their image and message for greater mainstream acceptance. As a result, Against the Law sold poorly compared to the band's previous gold and platinum releases. \"Shining Star\" is a heavy metal cover of the classic Earth, Wind & Fire song."@en ;

It was co-lead singer Seana Carmody's last full album with the group, before she formed the Farfisa-driven and somewhat more pop-oriented Syrup USA.

	dbo:abstract	"Box of Secrets is the debut album by Brighton-based rock band Blood Red Shoes, which was released on April 14, 2008, on the Mercury Records label. The album was leaked to the internet during November 2007. Several of the tracks were previously released as limited edition singles by the band, including \"I Wish I Was Someone Better\", \"ADHD\", \"It's Getting Boring By the Sea\" and \"You Bring Me Down\". The latter single was re-recorded and re-issued prior to the album's release. \"Try Harder\" was a B-side on the original single release of \"You Bring Me Down\". All of the band's singles appear as re-recorded versions on Box of Secrets, with the exception of \"I Wish I Was Someone Better\". The single \"Say Something, Say Anything\" was released on April 7, 2008, to coincide with the album release. The title track does not appear on the album. \"Box of Secrets\" was a B-side on the \"It's Getting Boring by the Sea\" single and is also featured on the compilation album I'll Be Your Eyes. The title is derived from a phrase between the two members to describe things that they can tell each other, but not anyone else. The closing track, \"Hope You're Holding Up\", is the first recorded Blood Red Shoes song to feature someone other than the band themselves playing an instrument, with Harriet from Los Campesinos! playing the violin."@en ;

Tiffany has stated that this album is especially aimed at the gay community, which represents a significant portion of her fan base; she says \"I have done the complete gay album.\" Tiffany did not have a record contract at the time, so this album was released independently and sold online at the CDBaby site, where it was for a while the top-selling CD. It was also made downloadable in the iTunes music store. Tiffany has been performing in various places in the US and the UK, including songs from this album as well as her earlier releases and cover songs. By December, 2005, the song \"Be With U Tonite\" was being played heavily on some dance-format radio stations. Several tracks from the album (\"Ride It\", \"Na Na Na\" and \"Fly\") have been featured in several episodes of the television series Ugly Betty. \"Ride It\" was featured in a season two episode of \"Brothers & Sisters\". In late April 2008, a track with the same name as this album (but not found on the album), \"Dust Off and Dance\", became available for download on the web.

Nakajima wrote the song as a theme for Shin'ai Naru Mono e, a television drama that she made guest appearance as a doctor. Shin'ai Naru Mono e's themes song peaked at #2 on the Japan's Oricon chart in summer of 1992, and thus became her first single. This song has sold more than a million copies. Prior to the release of the album Shin'ai Naru Mono e, the songs \"Two Boats\" and \"Haginohara\" were already performed on Yakai, which are experimental theaters Nakajima has performed annually since 1989. \"Thread (Ito)\" is a love song Nakajima dedicated to Zenji Nakayama, a later leader of Tenrikyo who got married at that time. In 1998, it was featured on the television drama Seija no Koushin and was also released as a double A-Side single with \"Another Name for Life\". This song has become well-known through a cover version recorded by the Bank Band, a project which Kazutoshi Sakurai and Takeshi Kobayashi launched for a charity.

dbr:Facing_Goya	rdf:type	schema:MusicAlbum ;
	dbo:abstract	"Facing Goya (2000) is an opera in four acts by Michael Nyman on a libretto by Victoria Hardie. It is an expansion of their one-act opera called Vital Statistics from 1987, dealing with such subjects as physiognomy and its practitioners, and also incorporates a musical motif from Nyman's art song, \"The Kiss\", inspired by a Paul Richards painting. Nyman also considers the work thematically tied to his other works, The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat, The Ogre, and Gattaca, though he does not quote any of these musically, save a very brief passage of the latter. It was premi\u00E8red at the Auditorio de Galicia, Santiago de Compostela, Spain on 3 August 2000. The revision with the cast heard on the album premiered at the Badisches Straatstheater in Karlsruhe, Germany, on October 19, 2002. Vital Statistics has been withdrawn. The Santiago version included more material from Vital Statistics. The opera was most recently performed at the 2014 Spoleto Festival USA, located in Charleston, South Carolina. The expanded opera deals with the elitism and prejudice of various movements in pseudosciences and art criticism, wrapped around a thread of a desire to make a clone of Francisco Goya through use of his long-lost skull, which he hid from the likes of Paul Broca, and which the Art Banker finds under a floorboard in a \"degenerate art\" gallery in Act II. This skull is the object of numerous fights in the second and third acts, often with one character snatching it from another. The opera is non-realistic in its presentation, with only one through-character, the Art Banker. Indeed, when Goya does appear, it is not the result of cloning, but a purely fantastical device. Four other performers play different roles in each section who are thematically connected. In addition, two actors are called for in non-speaking roles. The Art Banker also speaks narration into a dictaphone, but this was omitted from the studio recording, though the lines are reprinted in the booklet."@en ;

In 1996, the album was re-released by the label Resurgence, with 15 tracks including six new tracks, but without the songs \"Tired Of Waiting\" & \"All Over You\". Also some of the songs on this version varied in length from those on the RCA release, and the track \"Billy's Gone\" was completely remixed. This album was the final release for Level 42 before the breakup, and the last studio in the 90's with the participation of three original members Mark King, Mike Lindup and Phil Gould. Level 42 released a new album in 2006 named Retroglide with King, Lindup and Gary Husband and a small participation by Boon Gould. Phil Gould, dismayed at what he felt was the record company's ineptitude, did not go on the road with the band on their Forever Now tour. He was replaced for the tour with live session drummer Gavin Harrison, and Jakko Jakszyk rejoined on guitar. The album had three British hits: \"Forever Now\", \"All Over You\" and the final single that entered in the UK single charts \"Love in a Peaceful World\", all in the top 40."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Hard to Swallow is the third studio album by American rapper Vanilla Ice. Released by Republic Records in 1998, the album was the first album the performer recorded after a four-year hiatus following the 1994 release of Mind Blowin. Vanilla Ice intended the new musical direction found on the album as an attempt to move away from hip hop music and discard his former pop image. Hard to Swallow instead featured what he described as \"skate rock\", a fusion of heavy metal, punk rock and hip hop. The album features appearances from Amen vocalist Casey Chaos, Bloodhound Gang vocalist Jimmy Pop, and Insane Poetry front man Cyco. Session musicians included drummer Shannon Larkin, keyboardist Scott Borland, and Snot guitarist Sonny Mayo. Vanilla Ice took an interest in the musical style found on Hard to Swallow while performing as a member of a Miami grunge band, and was able to develop this sound through a friendship with producer Ross Robinson, with whom he shared an interest in motocross racing. Robinson produced the album after being advised against working with Vanilla Ice. The album's darker lyrical subject matter developed from conversations, in which Robinson encouraged him to write about his past. Subjects included Vanilla Ice's abusive childhood, drug addiction and struggles with fame. Although Republic Records believed that the album would revive Vanilla Ice's career, it received largely negative reviews and did not chart. The song \"S.N.A.F.U.\" was remade in Rhythm Party (Boom Boom Dance) as \"BEFREE\" with additional verses from Vanilla Ice himself and production from Konami in house artist Des-ROW."@en ;

The box set also comes with a 68-page booklet. Disc one includes live renditions of \"Landlord\" and \"Next to You\", which were recorded at the Bottom Line, New York on 4 April 1979 and originally broadcast on WNEW-FM, New York. Disc three has a live version of \"Driven to Tears\" which was recorded live at Les Arenes, Frejus, France, 28 August 1980 and is featured on the Urgh! A Music War soundtrack album (1982). While the box set does contain every original song released by the band, contrary to its title, these are not the complete recordings up to 1986. \"Truth Hits Everybody '83\" appeared on a limited edition gatefold single of \"Every Breath You Take\". Two versions of \"De Do Do Do, De Da Da Da\" were released in 1980 as a double A-side 7\", one with Sting singing Japanese lyrics, the other with Spanish lyrics (AM-25000). A third version of \"De Do Do Do, De Da Da Da\" was also re-recorded in 1986, entitled \"De Do Do Do, De Da Da Da '86\". This version of \"De Do Do Do, De Da Da Da\" is not present on the box set, but is available on the DTS-CD and SACD releases of Every Breath You Take: The Classics (1995). Other official releases were a 12\" single for \"Don't Stand So Close to Me '86\", which featured both an additional remix and live version of the song, and an extended version of \"Voices Inside My Head\". Live recordings of \"Can't Stand Losing You\" and \"Wrapped Around Your Finger\" had also been released but not included. Another rarity missing from the box set is the extended video mix of \"Invisible Sun\", which featured an additional verse not present on the LP version. \"Shambelle\", an instrumental written by Andy Summers, that is a B-side both of the singles \"Invisible Sun\" (UK) and \"Every Little Thing She Does Is Magic\" (US), was presented incorrectly, missing the hi-hat introduction played by Stewart Copeland. This error has never been corrected, and the original 45's is the only place to get the full-length versions. It should also be noted that the versions of \"Shambelle\" on the \"Invisible Sun\" and \"Every Little Thing She Does Is Magic\" singles have different track times, clocking 5:42 on the former and 5:10 on the latter. The version on this box set clocks in just about five minutes. The U.S. version of the box set also features the version of \"Don't Stand So Close To Me '86\" that was originally released on the album Every Breath You Take: The Singles (1986). This version is shorter than the extended dance mix of \"Don't Stand So Close to Me '86\" included on some international versions of the box set and includes a different guitar solo from Andy Summers. There is no edition of the box set that includes both versions of the song. There was also speculation by a number of music fans that \"Can't Stand Losing You\" was remastered from a needle drop of the original vinyl and that \"Roxanne\" had pitch issues due to tape drag and possible damage to the master tape used."@en ;

These and the other videos from the album, plus three from Tigerlily, were gathered on a Warner Music Vision home video, also entitled Ophelia. \"I love the opportunity to flex my thespian muscle,\" Merchant quips on it. The song \"King of May\" is a tribute to poet Allen Ginsberg.[citation needed] In 2009, a line from \"My Skin,\" accompanied by images of animal abuse, served as the basis for an ASPCA commercial. It was also featured in the television series Alias some years earlier. \"Kind & Generous\", \"The Living\", \"Break Your Heart\" and \"Life is Sweet\" appeared on Merchant's best-of collection, Retrospective: 1995\u20132005."@en ;

This song dates from the band's days as Opal and was initially slated to be the title track of Opal's second album.

	dbo:abstract	"Sleep No More, released on August 21, 1981 on Polydor Records, was The Comsat Angels' second album. It is widely regarded as a masterpiece that had a major influence on bands such as U2 (who toured with the band) and later groups such as Editors and Interpol. The album was reissued on CD twice, in 1995 by RPM Records and in 2006 by Renascent Records, with different track listings (see below). Sleep No More produced no singles, but it had the highest UK chart ranking for any Comsats album, peaking at No. 51. After the rushed production of the first album, Waiting for a Miracle, the band was able to put a lot more craft into Sleep No More. Frontman Stephen Fellows described how they achieved a resonant sound on a couple of the tracks: \"Pete Wilson suggested taking the drums out of the studio \u2013 on the fourth floor at Polydor \u2013 and putting them near the lift-shaft (elevator shaft) by the stairs. We then put microphones on the three floors above and below....Obviously we were only able to do this sort of thing in the evening when the offices were closed!\" Fellows felt the album Sleep No More had a unique quality among the band's work: \"The only [album] which had a 'thread' through it was Sleep No More, the 'thread' was the sound we wanted to get.\" Critics recognized it as a great followup to Waiting for a Miracle. AllMusic later said, \"Sleep No More is certainly more powerful, and it's also a greater achievement. Here The Comsat Angels became one of the era's exceptional bands.\" In a 1981 review, Mark Cooper of Sounds wrote that it was \"an album that is head and shoulders above anything else recorded this year\", while Jack Rabid of The Big Takeover summed up the album by saying, \"I think Sleep No More is one of the greatest pieces of music ever released!\" When Sleep No More was released, it sold out very quickly. Unfortunately Polydor took two weeks to ship additional stock to the record stores, an issue which was believed to have had a negative effect on the album's momentum."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Strange Angels is the fifth album by performance artist and singer Laurie Anderson, released by Warner Bros. Records in 1989. With this release, Anderson attempted to move away from her previous image as a performance artist into a more musical realm. Although music had always been part of her performance, it was never brought to the fore as much as it was on Strange Angels. Anderson did more singing on this album than she did on previous albums. As a result, completion of this album was delayed for nearly a year when Anderson decided that she needed to take singing lessons; in the process she discovered that she was a soprano. The album includes contributions from vocal artist Bobby McFerrin. Its cover photo was shot by Robert Mapplethorpe, who died several months before the album's release. One of the songs on this album, \"The Dream Before\" (also known as \"Hansel and Gretel Are Alive and Well\") had been introduced several years earlier in her short film What You Mean We? while she had performed \"Babydoll\" and \"The Day the Devil\" years previously on Saturday Night Live. Reaction to Anderson's new direction was mixed, with some critics praising her new style, while some accused her of abandoning her performance art roots, even though Anderson soon began work on a major piece titled The Nerve Bible. Her next album would not be released for five years. Strange Angels received a nomination for a Grammy Award for Best Alternative Music Album. Beautiful Red Dress was covered in Portuguese by the Brazilian singer Marina Lima, on her 2006 album 'La nos Primordios', titled \"Vestidinho Vermelho\" (Little Red Dress). The Dream Before contains the iconic phrase \"history is an angel being blown backwards into the future\" which is a reference to Walter Benjamin's musing on Paul Klee's painting Angelus Novus."@en ;

It returns to the stripped-down sound of his previous group, the Velvet Underground, with only guitars, bass and drums. It also follows the Velvet Underground stylistically by counterpointing and transposing jarring feedback-driven rock with tough and tender ballads, melodic distortion of a magnitude not heard since the \"Sister Ray\" days. The album was released near Reed's 40th birthday, and covers topics of marriage and settling down."@en ;

The album was conceived as an \"instrumental journey\" around the South West Coast Path, a 630-mile coastline path opened in 1978 in the duo's native West Country, and a celebration of the coastline's \"sights and sounds\". It is the band's only completely instrumental album, with each of its songs named after and inspired by different locations on the path. It was a project between Show Of Hands and The South West Coast Path Team, as part of the latter's celebrations for the silver jubilee (25th anniversary) of the path. As such the album is endorsed by various organisations who own different parts of the path, namely The Countryside Agency, The National Trust and English Heritage Commission,.and the music is ambient instrumentals inspired by different locations around the coastline. The duo hoped that, with the album, listeners would be inspired to discover or rediscover the \"endless fascination\" of the coast path. The album was released on 14 April 2003 by the duo's own label Hands on Music, a month before they released their following album Country Life. In July 2012, music from The Path featured in several themed videos on a new interactive official website for the South West Coast Path, which attracts some 400,000 hits a year.

	dbo:abstract	"Undermind is the tenth studio album by the American rock band Phish, released on June 15, 2004, by Elektra Records. Undermind was Phish's last album before their breakup in fall 2004 (the band subsequently reformed in 2009). The album's cover art appears to be a direct nod to Let It Be, the final studio album by The Beatles. In a review of Undermind, Glide Magazine suggests that the album's individual song contributions may also be intentionally \"Beatles-esque\". While the bulk of the songs are by frontman Trey Anastasio and Phish lyricist Tom Marshall, keyboard player Page McConnell, bass guitarist Mike Gordon and drummer Jon Fishman all contributed one song each. \"Maggie's Revenge\" is the album's only instrumental. One month before the album's release, Anastasio (and separately, McConnell) announced on Phish.com that the band would take an indefinitely long hiatus following a final summer tour. As such, a number of the songs were not performed live before the break up, though most have been played since the band's return in 2009. Undermind's songs remain among the least played originals in Phish's large catalog. Many reviews praised \"The Connection\", calling it \"the most commanding\" and \"most commercially accessible\" song of Phish's recording career to date. The song has not yet become a fixture in the band's live rotation, however. Early copies of the album included a DVD with the 25 minute documentary Specimens of Beauty, a behind the scenes film on the making of Undermind, directed by Danny Clinch. An extended improvisational studio jam recorded at the start of the Undermind sessions was later released as the Headphones Jam at LivePhish.com. In February 2009, Undermind was made available as a download in FLAC and MP3 formats at LivePhish.com."@en ;

The album features traditional Christmas songs (like Coventry Carol) and more contemporary Christmas songs (as Joni Mitchell's classic, River). Winter Magic includes \"The Little Road to Bethlehem\", \"Silent Night\", \"Veni Veni Emmanuel\", \"The Little Drummer Boy\", and \"The Coventry Carol\", among other seasonal songs. These Christmas tunes combine Westenra's voice with the accompaniment of a choral group. Westenra herself wrote three new songs for the CD: \"Peace Shall Come\", \"All With You\", and \"Christmas Morning\". The variety of melodies, as well as the different genres, of the songs included were designed to showcase the versatility of Hayley's voice to perform classically, as in \"Corpus Christi Carol\", as well as in a considerably more \"pop\" style for songs like \"Peace Shall Come\". Westenra\u2019s ability to achieve such variety in a single album has garnered her critical praise."@en ;

The lyrics have a more optimistic look than the ones in the politic-infused predecessors Riot Act and Pearl Jam, something frontman Eddie Vedder attributed to the election of Barack Obama. The band released the album through their own label Monkeywrench Records with worldwide distribution by Universal Music Group via a licensing agreement with Island Records. Physical copies of the record were sold through Target in North America, and promotion included a deal with Verizon, a world tour, and moderately successful singles \"The Fixer\" and \"Got Some\"/\"Just Breathe\".

Anurag Kashyap, the director of the film, is a fan of Indian Ocean and owns all their albums. He visited the band in Delhi along with Arindam Mitra, the producer of the film. \"Nothing filmi for my film,\" he told the band about the kind of music he was expecting. Kashyap gave the band a free hand when it came to the music. He gave the following reason for choosing Indian Ocean to compose the music for his film- The band created four tunes for the album, but only three made it into the final album. Kashyap was listening to some of their tracks and liked Bandeh. Later Piyush Mishra wrote the words after getting \"the feel of the song.\" He has also written the lyrics for the other two songs - Badshah In Jail and Bharam Bhap Ke.

	dbo:abstract	"Boucan d'enfer is a studio album from French artist Renaud. It was released in 2002 and published by Virgin Records. It was Renaud's first production with original material since 1994's \u00C0 la belle de mai. It marked Renaud's comeback to the musical scene after years of alcoholism. Some of the songs thus refer to this period, especially the first track, Docteur Renaud, Mister Renard which opposes the good and the bad sides of the past and present Renaud in an obvious parody of Dr Jekyll & Mr Hyde. The track was released as a single and proved a minor success hitting number 25 on the French charts. His separation from his wife is also very present in the lyrics, but the usual social themes haven't been left out either. Petit p\u00E9d\u00E9 is the story of a homosexual who left his country town after his coming out. But the song Manhattan-Kaboul, a duet with Belgian Axelle Red, became the most recognised song of the album, and one of Renaud's biggest hits (the single spent five months in the French top twenty with two weeks at number 2). In Manhattan-Kaboul Renaud talks about a Puerto Rican immigrant worker who died in the 9/11 attack, while Axelle Red tells the story of a young Afghan girl who died when the US-led coalition attacked her country in retaliation. \"Corsic'armes\" focuses on nationalism in Corsica, the song being dedicated to 'Christel' (Christelle), the widow of assassinated nationalist Fran\u00E7ois Santoni. Some of the album's songs have more humorous tones, for example Baltique, which is about Fran\u00E7ois Mitterrand's dog, who wasn't allowed to attend his master's funeral. Renaud writes \"But one day, I know God will recognise dogs\". L'entart\u00E9, on the other hand, is an all-out attack on philosopher Bernard-Henri L\u00E9vy, although he is only mentioned as \"l'entart\u00E9\", a reference to his numerous encounters with cream pie flinger No\u00EBl Godin. The album cover was shot in the bar at the Closerie des Lilas, the Left Bank cafe made famous by its patronage by Paris's literati since 1847."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Bridge over Troubled Water is the fifth and final studio album by American folk rock duo Simon & Garfunkel, released in January 1970 on Columbia Records. Following the duo's soundtrack for The Graduate, Art Garfunkel took an acting role in the film Catch-22, while Paul Simon worked on the songs, writing all tracks except Felice and Boudleaux Bryant's \"Bye Bye Love\" (previously a hit for the Everly Brothers). With the help of producer Roy Halee, the album followed a similar musical pattern as their Bookends, partly abandoning their traditional style in favor of a more creative sound, combining rock, R&B, gospel, jazz, world music, pop and other genres. After filming Catch-22, Garfunkel returned and the duo recorded around 14 tracks, three of which were not featured in the album. The inclusion of a 12th track was long discussed but they eventually decided upon 11 songs. It was described as both their \"most effortless record and their most ambitious.\" Bridge over Troubled Water was released on January 26, 1970 and several re-releases followed. The album was mixed and released in both stereo and quadraphonic. Columbia Records released a 40th Anniversary Edition on March 8, 2011, which includes two DVDs, including the politically themed TV special Songs of America (1969), the documentary The Harmony Game, additional liner notes and a booklet. Other reissues contain bonus tracks, such as the 2001 version, which covers the demo tapes of \"Feuilles-O\" and \"Bridge over Troubled Water\". Despite numerous accolades, the duo decided to split up, and parted company later in 1970; Garfunkel continued his film career, while Simon worked intensely with music. Both released solo albums in the following years. Bridge includes two of the duo's most critically acclaimed and commercially successful songs, \"Bridge over Troubled Water\" and \"The Boxer\", which were listed on Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Songs of All Time. Both critically and commercially successful, the album topped the charts in over ten countries and received two Grammy Awards, plus four more for the title song. It sold around 25 million records and was ranked on several lists, including at number 51 on Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time. The story of the making of the album is told in the 72 minute documentary The Harmony Game (2011), featuring interviews with both Simon & Garfunkel and various collaborators."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Bruce Springsteen with The Sessions Band: Live in Dublin is a 2007 video and audio offering that captures in-concert performances from the Bruce Springsteen with The Seeger Sessions Band Tour recorded in November 2006 at The Point Theatre in Dublin, Ireland. The release consists of a concert DVD, a Blu-ray Disc, and separate two-CD audio set. A \"special edition\" of the CD set includes the concert DVD as well. The DVD does not capture any one show in full, but rather congeals from three different shows at The Point. Selections include fan favorites from the tour, radical \"folk big band\" reinterpretations of the Springsteen canon, and rare songs appearing for the first time on any Springsteen release. Contrarily, a few set list regulars from the tour and shows are omitted. Of note is the dropping of \"Seeger\" from the band's name for this release, a very belated effort to avoid the mistaken stereotyping the name brought towards the kind of music the outfit was playing. The DVD debuted at number 1 on the Billboard Video Chart. The CD debuted at number 23 on the Billboard 200, selling 31,000 units, then fell to number 47 in its second week. As of July 11, 2007, it had sold 65,170 copies in the US."@en ;

Its release was postponed because of the September 11 attacks, which occurred just two weeks before its release date. Her label opted to release it later that year in Europe, but due to changing music trends, Milian decided not to release the album domestically. Milian made her first professional musical appearance on Ja Rule's single \"Between Me and You\", which led to a record deal with Def Soul and The Inc. Records in 2000. Milian traveled to Sweden where she collaborated with several producers, most notably Bloodshy & Avant, who helmed five tracks. Milian co-wrote eleven of the twelve songs on the album, taking inspiration from personal experiences. The album's musical style is mostly dance and R&B, and critics noted similarities to her contemporaries Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera. Milian was displeased by Def Soul's portrayal of her image, which she felt was constantly changing and confusing the audience. The critical response to Christina Milian was mixed; critics who gave a positive review enjoyed the catchy tracks and lead single \"AM to PM\", while others found that it lacked original ideas. The album peaked at number 23 in the UK, selling a total of 101,986 copies, and achieved Silver certification. Internationally, the album also charted in the Netherlands, Sweden and France. The album spawned two singles, \"AM to PM\" and When You Look at Me\", which charted worldwide."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Christmas Album is the sixth studio album by Boney M. It was recorded in the summer of 1981 and released on 23 November 1981. The album, which in certain territories was given the alternate title Christmas with Boney M., was issued just three weeks after the moderately successful Boonoonoonoos and had originally been planned as Liz Mitchell's first solo album. After the lukewarm reception of Boonoonoonoos, plans were, however, changed, and it was instead released under the name Boney M. to strengthen the band's declining commercial position. The album includes the million-selling 1978 Christmas number one \"Mary's Boy Child/Oh My Lord\" and it yielded two further single releases, \"Little Drummer Boy\" which turned out to be a Top 20 hit in Germany. A second single was released for Christmas 1982, \"Zion's Daughter\" (with new member Reggie Tsiboe pictured on the cover), but failed to chart. \"Feliz Navidad\" was chosen as a single in Scandinavia, and Spain opted for \"Jingle Bells\". Ariola (Spain) furthermore issued \"White Christmas\" in 1983. \"Christmas Album\" achieved Platinum sales in 1983. Christmas Album, which was given the title Mary's Boy Child: The Christmas Album in the UK, was to be the final Boney M. album release on the Atlantic Records label, even though they would remain with the company in Canada and Japan to 1986. One of the biggest commercial hits of the year 1981 was the Dutch \"Stars on 45\" Beatles cover medley, a number one single in the US and number two in the UK. To promote the albums Boonoonoonoos and Christmas Album, Frank Farian created a thirteen-minute medley in the style of Stars on 45 called \"6 Years of Boney M. Hits (Boney M. on 45)\", which was issued as both A- and B-side singles in certain territories. In the UK it was the B-side of Boonoonoonoos 12\" single \"We Kill the World (Don't Kill the World)\", in Germany the edited 7\" version was the B-side of Christmas Album single \"Little Drummer Boy\", and in January 1982 it was repackaged and released as the A-side. Later in the eighties, the tracks of Christmas Album, with the notable exception of the instrumental \"Winter Fairy-Tale\" and the closing song \"I'll Be Home for Christmas\", were to be remixed and re-issued as Die 20 sch\u00F6nsten Weihnachtslieder der Welt, The 20 Greatest Christmas Songs, The Most Beautiful Christmas Songs of the World, Happy Christmas, A Wonderful Christmas Time, and Christmas Party."@en ;

Though it was clear, that the track was going to be released as a single, the record company kept it under closure to introduce the upcoming crunk&B style with newcomer Ciara and her \"Goodies\" track.

According to an interview on the DVD The Making of Crack the Skye, this album represents the element of aether, which is represented by the souls and spirits of all things, a theme closely related to the context of the album. Because the elements of fire, water and earth have already represented by the band's first three albums Remission, Leviathan and Blood Mountain, respectively, the element of air is the only classical element which has yet to be represented by a Mastodon album, as their follow-up studio albums The Hunter and Once More 'Round The Sun do not represent an element, nor are they concept albums.

It featured keyboards, which was another departure in their music style, changing from their Creatures of the Night/Lick It Up/Animalize/Asylum heavy metal sound into a light metal sound. It was re-released in 1998 as part of the Kiss Remasters series, it is the last Kiss album to have been remastered. A relatively high number of songs from Crazy Nights were performed live during its supporting tour, but during and especially immediately following the tour, most of those songs were dropped and were never performed again. Only the song \"Crazy Crazy Nights\" was retained in their setlist for the Hot in the Shade Tour which followed a couple years later; it was dropped after that tour and would not return for nearly 20 years until the Sonic Boom Over Europe Tour. This makes the album one of the least represented in the bands' entire catalog over the course of their career in their setlists, behind only their 1981 album commercial flop Music from \"The Elder\"."@en ;

Although the album entered the chart respectably at No. 47 at a time when 1980s hard rock and heavy metal had largely declined, sales quickly dropped off and were not enough to reach gold RIAA certification. According to Don Dokken, the album sold around 400,000 copies. The song \"Too High to Fly\" was released as a promo single from the album and was a minor hit. As of 2009, it is the only song from the post-1980s portion of the bands' back catalogue that is still performed live, albeit only occasionally."@en ;

It was the first to feature the new band lineup of Willcox, Joel Bogen, Phil Spalding, Nigel Glockler and Adrian Lee. This was the breakthrough single for the band, reaching #4 in the UK Singles Charts on the back of its lead track, \"It's a Mystery\". The single also marked the band's first appearance on Top Of The Pops. Initially Toyah had great reservations about recording the song. \"When I first heard It\u2019s a Mystery I thought it wasn\u2019t for me. It was written by a friend called Keith Hale for a band called Blood Donor and the record company wanted me to cover it. ... Because I'd worked from 1977 right up to 1980 and I had an army of followers and I just knew this song wasn\u2019t for them,\" she said in a 1980 interview. \"It's a Mystery\" would later appear on the album Anthem, although the other three tracks from this EP would not appear on an album until the original CD release of Anthem in 1985. Many years later, these tracks would appear on other compilations and the eventual 1999 CD re-issue of Anthem itself. They were also featured on the 2005 compilation The Safari Singles Collection Part 1: 1979-1981. In several territories, \"It's a Mystery\" was released as a standalone single instead of being part of an EP.

The Atlantic Records label debut of Poco, Ghost Town was the final album by Poco to feature the group lineup who had played on Poco's 1978 breakout album Legend, as the 1984 Poco album release Inamorata would not feature Charlie Harrison. After the gold certified success of the 1978 ABC Records album release Legend, Poco's three subsequent album releases on MCA Records - who had absorbed ABC - failed to reach that level of success. Ghost Town marked Poco's move to Atlantic Records with no resultant comeback peaking at #195 on the album chart in Billboard magazine, well below the peak of the group's final MCA album Cowboys & Englishmen which had been released in February 1982 to reach a chart peak of #131. The first single from Ghost Town was the title cut which failed to reach the Billboard Hot 100, \"bubbling under\" with a peak of #108, and the second single \"Shoot the Moon\" while more successful fell short of the Top 40 with a Hot 100 peak of #50 in March 1983. A third single release: \"Break of Hearts\" - cited as one of his favorite overlooked compositions by Paul Cotton who's described the song as a followup to Poco's 1979 Top 20 hit \"Heart of the Night\" - failed to chart. Cotton has stated that Poco had problems with Atlantic Records: Poco would record one more album for Atlantic: Inamorata released in April 1984, then take a hiatus from recording until 1989 when the RCA Records release Legacy became Poco's second gold certified album."@en ;

Possibly in reaction to firm resistance from US radio to the previous two albums, E.S.P. (1987) and One (1989), which had done well in other countries, the US-based Warner Bros gave this one less promotion and did not issue remixes. They recorded this album and their next album Size Isn't Everything with engineer Femi Jiya. In the US, the album was available only on the CD and cassette, but the LP version was released in limited quantities in some countries. While it did not chart in the US, it reached No. 6 in Switzerland, No. 2 in Germany (reaching platinum certification in both countries), No. 24 in the UK and sold 1.1 million copies worldwide."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Innervisions is the 16th studio album by American musician Stevie Wonder, released August 3, 1973, on the Tamla label for Motown Records, a landmark recording of his \"classic period\". The nine tracks of Innervisions encompass a wide range of themes and issues: from drug abuse in \"Too High\", through inequality and systemic racism in \"Living for the City\", to love in the ballads \"All in Love Is Fair\" and \"Golden Lady\". The album's closer, \"He's Misstra Know-It-All\", is a scathing attack on then-US President Richard Nixon, similar to Wonder's song a year later, \"You Haven't Done Nothin'\". As with many of Stevie Wonder's albums, the lyrics, composition and production are almost entirely his own work, with the ARP synthesizer used prominently throughout the album. The instrument was a common motif among musicians of the time because of its ability to construct a complete sound environment. Wonder was the first black artist to experiment with this technology on a mass scale, and Innervisions was hugely influential on the subsequent future of commercial black music. He also played all or virtually all instruments on six of the album's nine tracks, making most of Innervisions a representative one-man band."@en ;

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Miaow_(album)>	rdf:type	schema:MusicAlbum ;
	dbo:abstract	"Miaow is the fourth album by The Beautiful South. It was released in March 1994. As with most Beautiful South albums, the songs were written by Dave Rotheray and Paul Heaton. The songs reflect a depressing moment in Heaton's life, and this continues with the follow-up album Blue is the Colour. The best example of this on the album is the opening track \"Hold on to What?\", which could be interpreted as an attack on the ruling classes, this is most evident at the end of the song where Heaton sings 'Chamberlain had his paper, Jesus had his cross, They held on, We held on to what?' The songs also led the South's first female singer, Briana Corrigan, to leave the band, after Heaton sent her copies of the songs, including \"Mini-correct\" and \"Worthless Lie\", she swiftly made the decision to leave. Equally swiftly, Heaton employed the then-unknown Jacqui Abbott in her place, who went on to appear on every album up to Painting It Red. The cover originally depicted a lot of dogs seated in a music hall with a gramophone on the stage. However, HMV made the band withdraw it as it mocked their trademark dog, and the band put out a second cover, depicting four dogs in a boat. Both paintings were created by Michael Sowa. It reached number 6 in the album charts, and had three singles released from it.Norman Cook, former band member of The Housemartins with Paul Heaton, is credited in the sleeve notes as doing the \"Programming on Hooligans\" (track 7)."@en ;

It was also released just a little over a year after her 2008 album, Guilty. Next Level marks Hamasaki's tenth consecutive album to be fully produced by Japanese producer and manager Max Matsuura, while she contributes to the album as the lead vocalist, background vocalist, and songwriter to all songs. Recorded in Japanese language with minor phrases in English, Next Level is an electronic album with numerous musical elements such as J-pop, rock, dance pop, and traditional Asian music. Five different formats were released to promote the album; a standalone CD, a CD and DVD bundle, a double album and DVD bundle, a USB format, and a global digital release. The five formats have different artworks that were issued for the album; all have Hamasaki posing in a small room surrounded by televisions. Upon the album's release, it was met with mixed to favourable reviews from music critics. Critics commended the album's production and its approach to western pop music. However, some criticized the album's lack of direction and regressive composition. Commercially, Next Level was a success. Next Level became Hamasaki's ninth studio album to reach the top spot on Japan's Oricon Albums Chart, and was certified double platinum by the Recording Industry Association of Japan (RIAJ) for shipments of 500,000 units. The album charted on Korean and Taiwanese Albums Chart. Two singles were released from Next Level, including one promotional. Its lead a-side single \"Days/Green\" was a commercial success, peaking at number one on the Japanese Oricon Singles Chart, whilst \"Days\" peaked at the top spot on the Japan Hot 100 chart. The albums second and final a-side single, \"Rule/Sparkle\", was a commercial success; it peaked at number one on the Japanese Oricon Singles Chart, whilst \"Rule\" peaked at the top spot on the Japan Hot 100 chart. The album's only promotional single, the title track, reached number 89 on the Japan Hot 100 chart, and 23 on the RIAJ Digital Track Chart.

I mean, making up and having reunions are always great in a way because you feel that sort of spirit or fresh wind again. It was great! We had a ball back then,\" adding, \"we just really pretty much made records like we always did and felt like we should use the old formulas with no more sort of experiments and just pretty much do what Accept is known for; and that's what we did.\" Udo concurs, calling Objection Overruled \"that classic Accept sound again\" as well as \"a very good Accept album\".

As was the case with their other early albums, it was recorded with a full orchestra. On the track \"Galadriel\", Lees played John Lennon's Epiphone Casino guitar, an event later recounted in a song on the band's 1990 album Welcome To The Show titled \"John Lennon's Guitar\". In an interview with Songfacts, Keith Domone (official biographer of Barclay James Harvest with his wife Monika) said John Lees wrote \"Mocking Bird\" back in 1968 while he was living with the parents of his future wife, Olwen. The song is based on a musical phrase from \"Pools Of Blue\", which he wrote around the same time.

	dbo:abstract	"Peter Gabriel is the first studio album by English rock musician Peter Gabriel and the first of four with the same eponymous title. Released on 25 February 1977, it was produced by Bob Ezrin. Gabriel and Ezrin assembled a team of musicians, including Robert Fripp of King Crimson, to record the album. Upon the album's release, Gabriel began touring with a seven-piece band under his own name. This album is often called either Peter Gabriel 1 or Car, referring to the album cover by London artist Peter Christopherson when he was associated with the London artists group Hipgnosis. The car was a Lancia Flavia owned by Hipgnosis founder Storm Thorgerson. The album went to No. 7 in UK and No. 38 in the USA. Gabriel's first solo success came with the album's lead single \"Solsbury Hill\", an autobiographical piece expressing his thoughts on leaving Genesis. Although mainly happy with the music, Gabriel felt that the album and especially the track \"Here Comes the Flood\" was over-produced. Piano-only or piano with synth versions may be heard on Robert Fripp's Exposure, his appearance on Kate Bush's 1979 TV special and a third version on his greatest hits compilation Shaking the Tree (1990). He often performs the song live accompanied by only himself on keyboard, either in German or English, depending on the audience. Direct Disk Labs released a half speed mastered version from the original master tapes. It has a longer version of \"Slowburn\" (5:16 instead of 4:36) with the song's introduction intact. All other versions of this album have the introduction (with a full band) edited out."@en ;

Following the completion of the MDNA era, Madonna worked on the album throughout 2014, co-writing and co-producing it with various musicians, including Diplo, Avicii, and Kanye West. She teased by uploading pictures of her recording sessions on her Instagram account. Working with a number of collaborators posed problem for Madonna in keeping a cohesive sound and direction for Rebel Heart, unlike her previous efforts where only a few people were involved. Thematically Rebel Heart represents the two different sides of the singer, her romantic and her rebellious side. The themes grew organically during the writing and recording sessions. Musically, it is a pop record which merges an array of genres such as 1990s house, trap and reggae, as well as the usage of acoustic guitars and gospel choir. Some of the songs are autobiographical in nature while others talk about love and introspection of Madonna's career. Rebel Heart features guest appearances from boxer Mike Tyson and rappers Nicki Minaj, Nas, and Chance the Rapper. The record had been set for a March 2015 release, with the first single to be released on Valentine's Day. But after a flurry of unexpected album content leaks, Madonna released the album for pre-order on iTunes Store on December 20, 2014, with six songs being available for download. Police investigation led to an Israeli man being arrested, who was charged for hacking into Madonna's computer and the leaks. The cover art for the deluxe edition of the album became popular, leading to numerous memes being created on Instagram, Tumblr, and Twitter. To promote the album, Madonna made several television appearances and performances, including the 57th Annual Grammy Awards and the 2015 Brit Awards. Further promotion happened from the Rebel Heart Tour, which started from September 2015 and continue till March 2016 through North America, Europe, Asia and Oceania. \"Living for Love\", \"Ghosttown\", \"Bitch I'm Madonna\", and \"Hold Tight\" were released as singles from the album. Rebel Heart received predominantly positive reviews from music critics; multiple reviewers called it her best effort in a decade. They found that unlike her previous two studio efforts, Hard Candy (2008) and MDNA (2012), the album was progressive in its sound. It debuted at number two on the Billboard 200 chart in the United States and the UK Albums Chart. Rebel Heart also peaked at number one in various countries across the world, including major music markets such as Australia, Canada, Germany, Italy, Spain, and Switzerland, while reaching the top ten of the charts in France, Ireland, Mexico, Japan, New Zealand, and Sweden, and attaining Gold certifications in some of the regions."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Roll On is the second album by Australian rock band The Living End, released in Australia and New Zealand on EMI in 2000, and internationally on Reprise/Warner Brothers in 2001. Musically, the album marked a change from the sound of their debut album, The Living End. Roll On had a notably more polished sound (as compared to the more garage-y sound of the previous album). Horn sections featured on numerous songs, such as Uncle Harry and Killing The Right. Whereas the previous album had displayed punk and rockabilly influences (by artists such as Green Day and Stray Cats), Roll On showed more Australian rock influences, particularly artists of the 80s Pub Rock era. The album even garnered comparison, by a few critics, to seminal punk band The Clash's creative breakthrough, London Calling. The album was recorded with producer Nick Launay, who had previously worked with artists such as Silverchair and Midnight Oil. It also marked the last major work featuring drummer Travis Demsey. In the downtime following the album's release and subsequent tour, he would leave the band, to be replaced by Andy Strachan. ARIA publicised that Roll On had officially achieved 2x Platinum status in Australia in November 2007. This was a great achievement as all of their other album releases were simultaneously awarded a higher accreditation. These new figures, however, indicated that sales of Roll On had been topped by the band's fourth studio release, State Of Emergency. This now means that the Roll On album now takes the position as the band's third most successful release. The song 'Carry Me Home' from the album was also featured in the video game Guitar Hero II as a playable song."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Santogold is the debut studio album by American artist Santigold (real name Santi White, who performed under the moniker Santogold at the time of the album's release). The album was released on April 29, 2008 in the United States and May 12 in the United Kingdom, on Downtown Records and Atlantic Records, respectively. Blending a variety of musical genres ranging from new wave to alternative rock and reggae, the album was very well received by critics upon release and was noted for its \"cross-genre confidence\". It earned multiple spots on 'top albums of the year' lists from major music periodicals such as NME, Rolling Stone, and Spin, and was positively compared to several other artists, including Debbie Harry, Pixies, M.I.A., Goldfrapp, The Go-Go's, Joe Strummer, and The Slits. White, who was admittedly influenced by '80s new wave rock, based the music of \"My Superman\" from the song \"Red Light\" by Siouxsie and the Banshees. The album spawned four singles, most notably \"L.E.S. Artistes\" and \"Creator\", and features appearances and/or production work from Bad Brains' Chuck Treece, Clifford Pusey of Steel Pulse, Diplo, Disco D, Freq Nasty, Spank Rock, Radioclit, Sinden, Switch, and Trouble Andrew. In addition to vocals, Santi White played guitar and keyboard on several songs on the album. The music video for the album's lead single, \"L.E.S. Artistes\", is an homage to the 1973 Alejandro Jodorowsky art film, The Holy Mountain."@en ;

Nigel Gray, who had previously worked with The Police, produced the album. The original vinyl issue had the lyrics printed on the inner-sleeve, although in the UK initial copies were accidentally shipped with a plain, generic liner. Rock-magazine Kerrang! relayed, from Bronze Records, the advice to write to the label in order that they could post the missing lyric-bag by return. The UK-release was somewhat delayed, and the band had already started their 20-date UK tour, which ran through May 1982. Castle Music issued what is considered the definitive edition of the CD 14 June 2004, adding eleven bonus tracks and extensive sleevenotes by Record Collector magazine's Joe Geesin.

The painting featured on the cover of the album includes a painting by Grant, with the inscription Somewhere Down the Road. Grant gave the original painting as gift to her friend and publicist Jennifer Cooke. Most of the new songs on the album were recorded in the new studio that Grant and her husband Vince Gill recently had built into their home. One of the songs on the album, \"Overnight\", is a duet recorded with Sarah Chapman, Grant's daughter. Grant wrote \"Unafraid\" about her mother. Roughly one year after the original release of the album a digital-only Expanded Edition of the album was released with additional material. The expanded edition includes the video for \"Better Than a Hallelujah\", the first single from the album, as well as an Ambient Mix of the song.

Staying Power features duets with Chaka Khan and Lisa Stansfield. These are the only White tracks with a shared vocal credit, apart from the 1981 duet album Barry and Glodean. Lead single \"Staying Power\", although not a significant hit, won White two Grammy Awards in 2000 in the categories Best Male R&B Vocal Performance and Best Traditional R&B Vocal Performance. Staying Power was less successful than The Icon Is Love, peaking at #13 on the R&B chart and #43 on the pop chart. Similarly, its critical reception was more mixed, the overall opinion tending to the view that while there is little to find fault with, the material and production is less distinguished than had been the case with The Icon Is Love.

Nas serves as executive producer for the album, and guest features include Nas himself, Aloe Blacc, BJ the Chicago Kid, and Dom Kennedy. The album's production, similar to Fashawn's debut album Boy Meets World, is handled primarily by Exile, with additional contributions by DJ Khalil, The Alchemist, and more. The title and concept of the album entails exploring the \"ecology\" of one's environment: the people, objects, and events surrounding one's life, the things that provoke human behavior, how individual choices lead to different paths, and how everyone and everything is ultimately interconnected. In its first week of release, The Ecology ranked among the top 10 most downloaded albums on the iTunes Hip-Hop Chart. The album was met with widespread acclaim from critics, who praised its heartfelt lyricism and soulful production. Since then, songs from the album have been featured in various forms of popular media."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) is the ninth studio album by anarcho-punk band Chumbawamba. Released after the massive success of their previous effort, Tubthumper, it commented on various aspects of the pop culture the band had inadvertently become a part of. It achieved this by the heavy inclusion of sound bites, pop culture and commercial culture references and even a small amount of self-parody. The 23 tracks (some songs being fully formed, some short, experimental and sample heavy) flow into one another almost without stop, and musical and lyrical themes are repeated throughout causing the album to much more tighly constructed than previous efforts and could be considered a concept album. The cover art follows the 'What You See Is What You Get' concept. It appears to be the head of a dog, but is actually a small part of a larger photo of two dogs copulating when the insert is opened up fully. This was a commercial failure for Chumbawamba, causing them to leave EMI a year later due to disputes. However, in the United States, Republic/Universal handled releases for MUTT Records, especially Readymades, but dropped the band from the label in 2004, allowing them to sign onto Koch Records."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"A Thousand Words is the sixth album for artist Styrofoam aka Arne Van Petegem. It is also the first for label Nettwerk. A Thousand Words eschews previous methods of what Styrofoam calls \u201Cbedroom producing\u201D in favor of a fresh approach. Breaking the mold from previous Styrofoam albums, which were self-produced, A Thousand Words enlisted the guidance of Wax Ltd (Wally Gagel and Xandy Barry), a Los Angeles production team with some pretty varied credits ranging from Sebadoh and Tanya Donelly to The Eels and Folk Implosion\u2014and even the Backstreet Boys and Jessica Simpson. That experience with both indie rock and pop was something Van Petegem found very attractive. The album features a diverse yet cohesive array of guest vocalists, like Jim Adkins from Jimmy Eat World, Blake Hazard and Josh Rouse. Van Petegem has grown out of the, as he puts it, \u201Cshy electronic guy afraid of singing\u201D to return to his roots singing in indie rock bands. He sounds relaxed and joyful as he delivers bright, multi-layered harmonies and simple, thought-provoking lyrics. \"I basically wanted to make an uptempo pop album with big choruses to sing along to. I sort of figured I\u2019d made enough sulky midtempo music for the rest of my life . . .

With previous co-producer Stevie Wonder busy recording his Songs in the Key of Life (which Minnie would also turn up on singing backup on \"Ordinary Pain\"), Minnie and husband Richard Rudolph hired Stewart Levine to co-produce her next album. More songs came from the Riperton/Rudolph camp as well as collaborations with Jazz Crusader Joe Sample and songwriter Leon Ware (who was enjoying a hot streak thanks to his work on Marvin Gaye\u2019s album I Want You). Guitarist Larry Carlton was brought in as an arranger. The result, Adventures In Paradise, took on a mellow soul-jazz tone. The album was a standard recording but available in two formats: quadraphonic and stereo. Epic Records anticipated a soul funky sequel, using Family Stone and Tower of Power horn section, which would have been released in November 1975.

Released on October 29, 1996, the album was an improvement for the band in both sales and critical reception as compared with their first album, A.M.. Taking its name from the 1979 film Being There, the self-produced effort featured more surrealistic and introspective writing than their previous album. This was due in part to several significant changes in Tweedy's life, including the birth of his first child. Musically, it juxtaposed the alternative country styles songs reminiscent of Uncle Tupelo with psychedelic, surreal songs. It was the only Wilco album with steel guitarist Bob Egan and the last with multi-instrumentalist Max Johnston."@en ;

This version of the album featured the new track \"Everytime It Rains\" and many new versions of songs featured on Flowers. As executive producer, Clive Davis enlisted collaborators including production team Cutfather & Joe and songwriter Billy Steinberg. While primarily a pop album, Cruel Summer explores the genres of house, motown, and dance. Cruel Summer received generally favorable reviews from music critics, who complimented its production and viewed it as a superior version of Flowers. Despite this, the album was not a success and failed to crack the top 100 of the Billboard 200, peaking at number 101. The project was promoted with a series of live television performances which received minimal participation from band member Linn Berggren. Two singles were released from the album, one which became an international success. Its titular lead single \"Cruel Summer\" peaked at number 10 on the US Billboard Hot 100 and was certified gold.

dbr:Flogging_a_Dead_Horse	rdf:type	schema:MusicAlbum ;
	dbo:abstract	"Flogging a Dead Horse is a compilation album of singles by the Sex Pistols, released after their break-up, and includes the four songs issued as singles A-sides that were included on Never Mind the Bollocks, Here's the Sex Pistols, three of their B-sides, and the six A-sides taken from The Great Rock 'n' Roll Swindle and one B-side, \"My Way\". By the time the record was released, the group was finished as a musical unit: the \"Sex Pistols\" consisted only of manager Malcolm McLaren and designer Jamie Reid. Their relationship with Virgin records was difficult, and Reid's tacky sleeve design was intended to warn people against another cash-in; it was largely interpreted as a hip joke, and seems to have hurt sales very little. Reid's first sleeve design consisted of the title hastily scrawled across his designs for the Never Mind the Bollocks (front cover) and The Great Rock 'n' Roll Swindle albums (back cover). It was printed, and copies exist, but was rejected by Virgin and never made it to record stores. For its replacement, Reid used a photo of a model from the cheapest agency he could find, along with dull letraset lettering, making the record look like a cheap easy listening album. The back cover featured a fake plastic dog turd on top of a gold disc of the Never Mind the Bollocks LP, a reference to a scene in the film The Great Rock 'n' Roll Swindle in which Steve Jones defecates on the gold disc awarded to Johnny Rotten for Never Mind The Bollocks. The album was released without the band's involvement or permission. The title has several ironic meanings: the idiomatic one of the saying \"Flogging a Dead Horse\" reflecting the fact that the Pistols' endeavours were now finished, futile and pointless; and the British slang use of 'flogging' to mean 'selling' - i.e. the Pistols' management, in true punk style, were overtly referencing that they were trying to get as much money for as little effort as possible from the album's sales."@en ;
