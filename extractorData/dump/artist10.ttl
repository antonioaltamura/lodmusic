Born and raised in Houston, Texas, she performed in various singing and dancing competitions as a child and rose to fame in the late 1990s as lead singer of R&B girl-group Destiny's Child. Managed by her father, Mathew Knowles, the group became one of the world's best-selling girl groups of all time. Their hiatus saw the release of Beyonc\u00E9's debut album, Dangerously in Love (2003), which established her as a solo artist worldwide, earned five Grammy Awards and featured the Billboard Hot 100 number-one singles \"Crazy in Love\" and \"Baby Boy\". Following the disbandment of Destiny's Child in June 2005, she released her second solo album, B'Day (2006), which contained hits \"D\u00E9j\u00E0 Vu\", \"Irreplaceable\", and \"Beautiful Liar\". Beyonc\u00E9 also ventured into acting, with a Golden Globe-nominated performance in Dreamgirls (2006) and starring roles in The Pink Panther (2006) and Obsessed (2009). Her marriage to rapper Jay Z and portrayal of Etta James in Cadillac Records (2008) influenced her third album, I Am... Sasha Fierce (2008), which saw the birth of her alter-ego Sasha Fierce and earned a record-setting six Grammy Awards in 2010, including Song of the Year for \"Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)\". Beyonc\u00E9 took a hiatus from music in 2010 and took over management of her career; her fourth album 4 (2011) was subsequently mellower in tone, exploring 1970s funk, 1980s pop, and 1990s soul. Her critically acclaimed fifth album, Beyonc\u00E9 (2013), was distinguished from previous releases by its experimental production and exploration of darker themes. Her sixth album, Lemonade (2016), was released in conjunction with a short film of the same name. Throughout a career spanning 19 years, she has sold over 100 million records as a solo artist, and a further 60 million with Destiny's Child, making her one of the best-selling music artists of all time. She has won 20 Grammy Awards and is the most nominated woman in the award's history. She is the most awarded artist at the MTV Video Music Awards, with 24 wins. The Recording Industry Association of America recognized her as the Top Certified Artist in America during the 2000s (decade). In 2009, Billboard named her the Top Radio Songs Artist of the Decade, the Top Female Artist of the 2000s (decade) and handed their Millennium Award in 2011.

Called the Goddess of Pop, she is described as embodying female autonomy in a male-dominated industry. She is known for her distinctive contralto singing voice and for having worked in numerous areas of entertainment, as well as adopting a variety of styles and appearances during her five-decade-long career. Cher gained popularity in 1965 as one half of the folk rock husband-wife duo Sonny & Cher after their song \"I Got You Babe\" reached number one on the American and British charts. She began her solo career simultaneously, releasing in 1966 her first million-seller song, \"Bang Bang (My Baby Shot Me Down)\". She became a television personality in the 1970s with her shows The Sonny & Cher Comedy Hour, watched by over 30 million viewers weekly during its three-year run, and Cher. She emerged as a fashion trendsetter by wearing elaborate outfits on her television shows. While working on television, she established herself as a solo artist with the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 chart-topping singles \"Gypsys, Tramps & Thieves\", \"Half-Breed\", and \"Dark Lady\". After her divorce from Sonny Bono in 1975, Cher launched a comeback in 1979 with the disco-oriented album Take Me Home and earned $300,000 a week for her 1980\u201382 residency show in Las Vegas. In 1982, Cher made her Broadway debut in the play Come Back to the Five and Dime, Jimmy Dean, Jimmy Dean and starred in the film adaptation of the same title. She subsequently earned critical acclaim for her performances in films such as Silkwood (1983), Mask (1985), and Moonstruck (1987), for which she won the Academy Award for Best Actress. She then revived her musical career by recording the rock-inflected albums Cher (1987), Heart of Stone (1989), and Love Hurts (1991), all of which yielded several successful singles. She reached a new commercial peak in 1998 with the album Believe, whose title track became the biggest-selling single of all time by a female artist in the UK. It also features the pioneering use of Auto-Tune, also known as the \"Cher effect\". Her 2002\u20132005 Living Proof: The Farewell Tour became one of the highest-grossing concert tours of all time, earning $250 million. In 2008, she signed a $180 million deal to headline the Colosseum at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas for three years. After seven years of absence, she returned to film in the 2010 musical Burlesque. Cher's first studio album in 12 years, Closer to the Truth (2013), became her highest-charting solo album in the U.S. to date at number three. Cher has won a Grammy Award, an Emmy Award, an Academy Award, three Golden Globe Awards, a Cannes Film Festival Award, and a special CFDA Fashion Award, among several other honors. Throughout her career, she has sold 100 million records worldwide. She is the only artist to date to have a number-one single on a Billboard chart in each decade from the 1960s to the 2010s.

His mother taught him to play the piano and he started performing in his teens. Dropping out of school, he learned to operate lights for vaudeville and to improvise accompaniment for silent films at a local movie theater in his home town of Red Bank, New Jersey. By 16 years old, he increasingly played jazz piano at parties, resorts and other venues. In 1924, he went to Harlem, where his performing career expanded; he toured with groups to the major jazz cities of Chicago, St. Louis and Kansas City. In 1929 he joined Bennie Moten's band in Kansas City, and played with them until Moten's death in 1935. In 1935, Basie formed his own jazz orchestra, the Count Basie Orchestra, and in 1936 took them to Chicago for a long engagement and their first recording. He led the group for almost 50 years, creating innovations like the use of two \"split\" tenor saxophones, emphasizing the rhythm section, riffing with a big band, using arrangers to broaden their sound, and others. Many musicians came to prominence under his direction, including the tenor saxophonists Lester Young and Herschel Evans, the guitarist Freddie Green, trumpeters Buck Clayton and Harry \"Sweets\" Edison and singers Jimmy Rushing and Joe Williams. Basie's theme songs were \"One O'Clock Jump\", developed in 1935 in the early days of his band, and later \"April in Paris\"."@en ;

On a few occasions, he also played the clarinet and piccolo. Dolphy was one of several multi-instrumentalists to gain prominence in the 1960s. He was one of the first important bass clarinet soloists in jazz, extended the vocabulary and boundaries of the alto saxophone, and was among the earliest significant jazz flute soloists. His improvisational style was characterized by the use of wide intervals, in addition to using an array of extended techniques to reproduce human- and animal-like effects which almost literally made his instruments speak. Although Dolphy's work is sometimes classified as free jazz, his compositions and solos were often rooted in conventional (if highly abstracted) tonal bebop harmony and melodic lines that suggest the influences of modern classical composers B\u00E9la Bart\u00F3k and Igor Stravinsky."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Janet Damita Jo Jackson (born May 16, 1966) is an American singer, songwriter, dancer and actress. Known for a series of sonically innovative, socially conscious and sexually provocative records, as well as elaborate stage shows, television and film roles, she has been a prominent figure in popular culture for over 30 years. The youngest child of the Jackson family, she began her career with the variety television series The Jacksons in 1976 and went on to appear in other television shows throughout the 1970s and early 1980s, including Good Times and Fame. After signing a recording contract with A&M Records in 1982, she became a pop icon following the release of her third studio album Control (1986). Her collaborations with record producers Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis incorporated elements of rhythm and blues, funk, disco, rap, and industrial beats, which led to crossover success in popular music. In addition to receiving recognition for the innovation in her records, choreography, music videos, and prominence on radio airplay and MTV, she was acknowledged as a role model for her socially conscious lyrics. In 1991 she signed the first of two record-breaking, multimillion-dollar contracts with Virgin Records, establishing her as one of the highest paid artists in the industry. Her debut album under the label, Janet (1993), saw her develop a public image as a sex symbol as she began to explore sexuality in her work. That same year, she appeared in her first starring film role in Poetic Justice; since then she has continued to act in feature films. By the end of the 1990s, she was named the second most successful recording artist of the decade. The release of her seventh studio album All for You (2001) coincided with a celebration of her impact on popular music as the inaugural MTV Icon. After parting ways with Virgin she released her tenth studio album Discipline (2008), her first and only album with Island Records. In 2015 she partnered with BMG Rights Management to launch her own record label, Rhythm Nation and released her eleventh studio album Unbreakable the same year. Having sold over 100 million records, she is ranked as one of the best-selling artists in the history of contemporary music. She has amassed an extensive catalog, with singles such as \"Nasty\", \"Rhythm Nation\", \"That's the Way Love Goes\", \"Together Again\" and \"All for You\" among her signature songs; she holds the record for the most consecutive top 10 hits on the US Billboard Hot 100 singles chart by a female artist with 18. In 2009, Billboard magazine released its list of the Hot 100 All-Time Top Artists, placing her at number seven, while in 2010, ranking her fifth among the \"Top 50 R&B/Hip-Hop Artists of the Past 25 Years\". One of the world's most awarded artists, her longevity, records and achievements reflect her influence in shaping and redefining the scope of popular music. She has been cited as an inspiration among numerous performers."@en ;

One of its founders, Garcia performed with the Grateful Dead for their entire thirty-year career (1965\u20131995). Garcia also founded and participated in a variety of side projects, including the Saunders\u2013Garcia Band (with longtime friend Merl Saunders), the Jerry Garcia Band, Old and in the Way, the Garcia/Grisman acoustic duo, Legion of Mary, and the New Riders of the Purple Sage (which Garcia co-founded with John Dawson and David Nelson). He also released several solo albums, and contributed to a number of albums by other artists over the years as a session musician. He was well known for his distinctive guitar playing and was ranked 46th in Rolling Stone's \"100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time\" cover story. Later in life, Garcia was sometimes ill because of his diabetes, and in 1986 went into a diabetic coma that nearly cost him his life. Although his overall health improved somewhat after that, he also struggled with heroin and cocaine addictions, and was staying in a California drug rehabilitation facility when he died of a heart attack in August 1995."@en ;

In a music career that spanned more than 40 years, Entwistle was best known as the original bass guitarist for the English rock band The Who. He was the only member of the band to have formal musical training. His aggressive lead sound influenced many rock bass players. He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of the Who in 1990. Entwistle's instrumental approach used pentatonic lead lines, and a then-unusual treble-rich sound (\"full treble, full volume\") created by roundwound RotoSound steel bass strings. He was nicknamed \"The Ox\" and \"Thunderfingers,\" the latter because his digits became a blur across the four-string fretboard. In 2011, he was voted as the greatest bass guitarist of all time in a Rolling Stone reader's poll. According to The Biography Channel, Entwistle is considered by many to be the best rock bass guitarist that ever lived, and is considered to have done for the bass what Jimi Hendrix did for the guitar."@en ;

Her self-titled debut album Melissa Etheridge was released in 1988 and became an underground hit. The album peaked at No. 22 on the Billboard 200, and its lead single, \"Bring Me Some Water\", garnered Etheridge her first Grammy Award nomination for Best Rock Vocal Performance, Female. In 1993, Etheridge won her first Grammy award for her single \"Ain't It Heavy\" from her third album, Never Enough. Later that year, she released what would become her mainstream breakthrough album, Yes I Am. The album featured three Top 40 hits, including \"I'm the Only One\" (No. 8) and \"Come to My Window\" (No. 25), the latter scoring Etheridge her second Grammy award. Yes I Am peaked at No. 15 on the Billboard 200, and spent 138 weeks on the chart, earning a RIAA certification of 6x Platinum, her largest to date. In October 2004, Etheridge was diagnosed with breast cancer, and underwent surgery and chemotherapy. At the 2005 Grammy Awards, she made a return to the stage and, although bald from chemotherapy, performed a tribute to Janis Joplin with the song \"Piece of My Heart\". Etheridge's performance was widely lauded, with India.Arie writing \"I Am Not My Hair\" about Etheridge.

Muddy Waters grew up on Stovall Plantation, near Clarksdale, Mississippi, and by age 17 was playing the guitar at parties, emulating local blues artists Son House and Robert Johnson. He was recorded in Mississippi by Alan Lomax for the Library of Congress in 1941. In 1943, he moved to Chicago with the hope of becoming a full-time professional musician, eventually recording, in 1946, first for Columbia Records and then for Aristocrat Records, a newly formed label run by the brothers Leonard and Phil Chess. In the early 1950s, Muddy Waters and his band\u2014Little Walter Jacobs on harmonica, Jimmy Rogers on guitar, Elgin Evans on drums and Otis Spann on piano\u2014recorded several blues classics, some with bassist and songwriter Willie Dixon, including \"Hoochie Coochie Man\", \"I Just Want to Make Love to You\" and \"I'm Ready\". In 1958, he traveled to England, helping to lay the foundations of the subsequent blues boom there. His performance at the Newport Jazz Festival in 1960 was recorded and released as his first live album, At Newport 1960. Muddy Waters' influence is tremendous, not just on blues and rhythm and blues but on rock and roll, hard rock, folk music, jazz, and country music. His use of amplification is often cited as the link between Delta blues and rock and roll."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Neil Percival Young, OC OM (born November 12, 1945) is a Canadian singer-songwriter and musician, producer, director and screenwriter. He began performing in a group covering Shadows instrumentals in Canada in 1960, before moving to California in 1966, where he co-founded the band Buffalo Springfield together with Stephen Stills and Richie Furay, and later joined Crosby, Stills & Nash in 1969. He released his first album in 1968 and has since forged a successful and acclaimed solo career, spanning over 45 years and 35 studio albums, with a continuous and uncompromising exploration of musical styles. The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame website describes Young as \"one of rock and roll's greatest songwriters and performers\". He was inducted into the Hall of Fame twice, first as a solo artist in 1995, and second as a member of Buffalo Springfield in 1997. Young's music is characterized by his distinctive guitar work, deeply personal lyrics and characteristic alto or high tenor singing voice. Although he accompanies himself on several different instruments, including piano and harmonica, his idiosyncratic electric and acoustic guitar playing are the defining characteristics of a varyingly ragged and melodic sound. While Young has experimented with differing music styles throughout a varied career, including electronic music, most of his best known work is either acoustic folk-rock and country rock or electric, amplified hard rock (most often in collaboration with the band Crazy Horse). Musical styles such as alternative rock and grunge also adopted elements from Young. His influence has caused some to dub him the \"Godfather of Grunge\". Young has directed (or co-directed) a number of films using the pseudonym Bernard Shakey, including Journey Through the Past (1973), Rust Never Sleeps (1979), Human Highway (1982), Greendale (2003), and CSNY/D\u00E9j\u00E0 Vu (2008). He has also contributed to the soundtracks of films including Philadelphia (1993) and Dead Man (1995). Young is an environmentalist and outspoken advocate for the welfare of small farmers, having co-founded in 1985 the benefit concert Farm Aid. He is currently working on a documentary about electric car technology, tentatively titled LincVolt. The project involves his 1959 Lincoln Continental converted to hybrid technology as an environmentalist statement. In 1986, Young helped found The Bridge School, an educational organization for children with severe verbal and physical disabilities, and its annual supporting Bridge School Benefit concerts, together with his ex-wife Pegi Young (n\u00E9e Morton). Young has three children: sons Zeke (born during his relationship with actress Carrie Snodgress) and Ben, who were diagnosed with cerebral palsy, and daughter Amber Jean who, like Young, has epilepsy. Young lived on Broken Arrow Ranch, about a thousand acres near La Honda, California until his 2014 divorce from Pegi, when he gave her the ranch and moved to Los Angeles with his current partner, Daryl Hannah. Although he has lived in California since the 1970s and sings as frequently about U.S. themes and subjects as he does about his native country, he has retained his Canadian citizenship. On July 14, 2006, Young was awarded the Order of Manitoba, and on December 30, 2009, was made an Officer of the Order of Canada."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Nicholas Edward \"Nick\" Cave (born 22 September 1957) is an Australian musician, singer-songwriter, author, screenwriter, composer and occasional film actor, best known as the frontman of Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds. Referred to as rock music's \"Prince of Darkness\", Cave's music is generally characterised by emotional intensity, a wide variety of influences, and lyrical obsessions with death, religion, love and violence. NME called him \"the grand lord of gothic lushness\". Born and raised in rural Victoria, Cave studied art in Melbourne and for a time considered becoming a painter. In the 1970s, he formed and fronted the Boys Next Door, which spearheaded Melbourne's bourgeoning post-punk scene. They changed their name to the Birthday Party and relocated to London in 1980. Disillusioned by life in England, the band's sound and live shows became increasingly violent, and they garnered a reputation as one of darkest and most challenging groups of the 1980s. For this they are credited as a major influence on gothic rock. The band, having released three albums and two EPs, fell apart after moving to West Berlin in 1983. After the break up of the Birthday Party, Cave formed Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds in 1983, releasing its debut album the following year. Much of the band's early material was set in a mythic American Deep South, drawing on spirituals and Delta blues, while Cave's preoccupation with Old Testament notions of good versus evil culminated in what has been called his signature song, \"The Mercy Seat\" (1988). The 1996 album Murder Ballads featured \"Where the Wild Roses Grow\", a duet with Kylie Minogue, Cave's most commercially successful single to date. Skeleton Tree, the band's sixteenth and most recent album, was released in 2016. Cave formed the garage rock group Grinderman in 2006, which has since released two albums. Cave co-wrote, scored and starred in the 1988 Australian prison film Ghosts... of the Civil Dead (1988), directed by John Hillcoat. Cave also wrote the screenplay for Hillcoat's bushranger film The Proposition (2005), and composed the soundtrack with frequent collaborator Warren Ellis. The pair's film score credits include The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford (2007), The Road (2009) and Lawless (2012). Cave is the subject and co-writer of the semi-fictional \"day in the life\" documentary 20,000 Days on Earth (2014). He has also released two novels: And the Ass Saw the Angel (1989) and The Death of Bunny Munro (2009). Cave's songs have been covered by a wide range of artists, including Johnny Cash, Metallica and Arctic Monkeys. Upon his induction into the ARIA Hall of Fame, ARIA Awards committee chairman Ed St John said: \"Nick Cave has enjoyed\u2014and continues to enjoy\u2014one of the most extraordinary careers in the annals of popular music. He is an Australian artist like Sidney Nolan is an Australian artist\u2014beyond comparison, beyond genre, beyond dispute.\""@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Nicholas Rodney \"Nick\" Drake (19 June 1948 \u2013 25 November 1974) was an English singer-songwriter and musician, known for his acoustic guitar-based songs. He failed to find a wide audience during his lifetime, but his work has posthumously achieved wider notice and recognition. Drake signed to Island Records when he was 20 years old and was a student at the University of Cambridge, and released his debut album, Five Leaves Left, in 1969. By 1972, he had recorded two more albums\u2014Bryter Layter and Pink Moon. Neither sold more than 5,000 copies on initial release. Drake's reluctance to perform live, or be interviewed, contributed to his lack of commercial success. No footage of the adult Drake has ever been released; only still photographs and home footage from his childhood. Drake suffered from major depression, and this was often reflected in his lyrics. On completion of his third album, 1972's Pink Moon, he withdrew from both live performance and recording, retreating to his parents' home in rural Warwickshire. On 25 November 1974, at the age of 26, Drake died from an overdose of approximately 30 amitriptyline pills, a prescribed antidepressant. His cause of death was determined to be suicide. Drake's music remained available through the mid-1970s, but the 1979 release of the retrospective album Fruit Tree allowed his back catalogue to be reassessed. By the mid-1980s Drake was being credited as an influence by such artists as Robert Smith, David Sylvian and Peter Buck. In 1985, The Dream Academy reached the UK and US charts with \"Life in a Northern Town\", a song written for and dedicated to Drake. By the early 1990s, he had come to represent a certain type of \"doomed romantic\" musician in the UK music press. His first biography was published in 1997, followed in 1998 by the documentary film A Stranger Among Us."@en ;

Some of her early charting singles included \"Angry Johnny\", \"Trigger Happy Jack\", \"Hello\", and \"Hey Pretty.\" Videos for these singles had heavy rotation on MTV. Poe spent six years with Atlantic Records and is currently on her own label, Repoezessed Music Records.\" Noteworthy was Poe's early involvement with her online community of fans. Her web site, and the fan sites that supported her early in her career, predated modern social networking platforms and were among the first of their kind. Atlantic Records' Senior Vice President of New Media, Nikki Sleight, referred to Poe's online power and one-on-one communication with thousands attending her concerts as \"unheard of and pretty phenomenal\" in Sleight's 1997 interview with Web Magazine. In 2004, she co-founded the digital innovations agency Signature Creative with John Gheur. In September 2014, Poe received the title of UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador due to her invitation by Yoko Ono to participate in a UNICEF campaign and her donated performance. The campaign launched a world version of John Lennon's classic song \"Imagine\" featuring dozens of musical artists from around the world. Poe joined others singing in the music video that included a video clip of John Lennon that spearheads a global campaign by UNICEF to celebrate the 25th anniversary of the Convention on the Rights of the Child."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Desiree Heslop, best known as Princess, is a British singer who found chart success in the mid-1980s. In the late-1970s she worked with the group Osibisa. Her debut solo album Princess (1986) was composed and produced by Stock Aitken Waterman which contained the hit single, \"Say I'm Your Number One\". The album spawned five charting singles, and was certified silver in the UK. Heslop signed with Polydor and recorded her second album, All for Love (1987) in the United States, but neither the album nor its three singles had much success. In 1989, she released the stand-alone single \"Lover Don't Go\", which failed to chart. Her third album, Say It, which was slated for release in 1990, was never issued as Princess retired from the music scene and moved to the US after the death of her mother and the assassination of her brother. From 1991 to 2003 she lived in the US, before returning to England in 2003. That same year she formed her own music label with her brother Donovan, OnDa Ground Music Label, which has released all her music since, and released her first single in 14 years, \"Ride\", with rap ensemble EEDB. A music video was also filmed which referenced her retirement. She appeared in ITV's 2005 production Hit Me, Baby, One More Time, singing Kylie Minogue's \"Slow\". In April 2014, she released her third album, The Emergence, the first in 27 years. It is the first in a trilogy of albums, the other ones titled The Passion and The One."@en .

He released his first album, Aaron Watson - Singers and Songwriters in 1999 and followed that up with Texas Cafe in 2000. It wasn't until this third album, Shut Up And Dance, in 2002, that Watson gained radio airplay and attention nationwide. Following that record's success, he released The Honky Tonk Kid, produced by Ray Benson and featuring Willie Nelson on guest vocals. Watson has collaborated with other notable musicians (including Dale Watson, Jack Ingram, and Bill Joe Shaver), and has performed hundreds of shows a year, touring nationally and internationally. In February 2015, Watson made history when he released The Underdog, making him the first independent male artist to debut at number one on the Billboard Top Country Albums chart with a self-released and independently distributed and promoted album. The record sold more than 26,000 units in the first week. By the end of 2014, the lead single from The Underdog, \"That Look,\" which Watson wrote for his wife Kimberly, debuted in the top 10 of the Billboard Country Digital Songs Chart and was one of the most successful-selling independent singles."@en .

He describes his works as not belonging to any particular music tradition. In his work he sets ancient and modern Arabic, Sumerian, and other West Asian texts to traditional instruments (such as the ney, kanun, darbuka, violin, flute and lute), and synthesizers. He was born in Aleppo, and after living for a time in Beirut moved to Paris at the age of 22 where he studied Western classical music. While there he translated classical poetry, such as the Sumerian Epic of Gilgamesh, into French. He has stated that he prefers to live in the West, saying in a 2000 interview that he has an \"inability to work in the Arab countries, in which the way people live is still conditioned by halal and haram. Here I can produce contemporary art, I can work in freedom, and there is 'motion' around what I produce: journalism, concerts, programme\u2026Nobody tells me to write a song for a specific political occasion.\" His music has been featured in the films Al Leja, directed by Ryad Chaia, Elia Suleiman's Chronicle of a Disappearance. and Florence Strauss's \"Between Two Notes\" 2006, as well as in Jan Visser's 1975 TV documentary De Droom (The Dream), based on drawings by and interviews with Palestinian refugee children and Palestinian resistance poetry."@en .

She was born and raised in Ajaccio, Corsica. She was discovered by Myl\u00E8ne Farmer, following her winning performance in the talent show, Graines de Star, in 1999. While collaborating with Myl\u00E8ne Farmer and Laurent Boutonnat, she followed it with a series of albums that attained immense popularity by pushing the boundaries of lyrical content in mainstream popular music and imagery in her music videos, which became a fixture on NRJ, Europe 1, MTV, Virgin Radio, and many others. Throughout her career, many of her songs have been in top 25 hit lists on the record charts, including \"Moi... Lolita\", \"L'Aliz\u00E9\", \"J'en ai marre!\", \"Gourmandises\", \"Mademoiselle Juliette\", her cover version of \"La Isla Bonita\", \"Parler Tout Bas\", \"Les collines\" and \"\u00C0 cause de l'automne\".

Her first album was Gourmandises, which received Platinum certification within three months of release. After its international launch in 2001, Gourmandises was a success both in France and abroad, earning Aliz\u00E9e the distinction of being the highest selling female French singer in 2001. The album featured her most successful single \"Moi... Lolita\" which reached number one in several countries in Europe and East Asia, in the UK the song was acclaimed by the New Musical Express who recognised it with a \"Single of the Week\" award. It became a rare example of a foreign-language song to chart highly in the UK, peaking at number 9. Gourmandises was followed by a second studio album, Mes courants \u00E9lectriques, in 2003. Following its release, Aliz\u00E9e toured during the fall of 2003, performing in 43 concerts throughout France, Belgium and Switzerland.

	dbo:abstract	"Andrew Johnston (born 23 September 1994) is a British singer who rose to fame when he appeared as a boy soprano on the second series of the UK television talent show Britain's Got Talent in 2008. Although he did not win the competition, he received a contract to record with Syco Music, a label owned by the Britain's Got Talent judge Simon Cowell. Johnston's debut album, One Voice, was released in September of the same year, and reached number four on the UK Albums Chart. Although Johnston originally performed as a treble, his voice has since matured to baritone, and he is now a member of the National Youth Choir. Johnston was born in Dumfries, Scotland, and his parents separated when he was an infant. He and his mother moved to Carlisle, where they lived in \"poverty\". He became head chorister at Carlisle Cathedral, and was bullied at school because of his love of classical music. While some journalists have argued Britain's Got Talent producers took advantage of Johnston's background, others have hailed his story as inspirational. In 2009, he graduated from Trinity School. Johnston now studies full-time at the Royal Northern College of Music."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Arthur (Artashes) Meschian (Armenian: \u0531\u0580\u0569\u0578\u0582\u0580 \u0544\u0565\u057D\u0579\u0575\u0561\u0576, born March 3, 1949, Yerevan, Armenia) is an Armenian architect, musician, composer, poet, singer and painter. He is also known as one of the founders of Armenian rock.He was the founder and the lead singer of Apostles (1968 \u2013 1979), the first rock band performing songs in their native language in the history of the Soviet Union. He is the author of different architectural projects, including Guest House and the new building of Matenadaran in Armenia. Since childhood, Meschian has been interested in music and arts; singing songs in languages ranging from Hungarian to English. At the age of seven, he started taking violin and piano lessons at the school of music named after A. Spendiaryan. It was during those years when he made his first steps in writing songs and joined the boy\u2019s chorus at the National Academic Theater for Opera and Ballet. In 1973, he briefly joined the chorus of the Mother See of Holy Etchmiadzin. Even though his stay was short (less than a year) in the chorus, it had a profound influence on his subsequent musical creations. While still at school, Meschian wrote some of his early masterpieces including \u201CWhere were you, God?,\u201D \u201CThe Will,\u201D and \u201CThe Old Man.\u201D In 1965, he first performed his well acclaimed and widely controversial \u201CWhere were you, God?\u201D in the auditorium of number 122 secondary school where he was a student at the time. In 1966, he got accepted to the department of architecture at the National Polytechnic University of Armenia. In 1967, Meschian, along with his friends Levon Melikian and Gregory Nalbandian, founded a rock band which they initially did not give a name. The band was simply referred to as \u201CThe Band of the Department of Architecture.\u201D After giving a series of concerts throughout 1967 and on, the band gained an immense deal of acclaim among the youth. By blending Armenian spiritual music with the thriving rock of the time, the band left a remarkable impression on its listeners and became a true revelation. As a result, the activists at the Communist Committee raised concerns about the band\u2019s prolific endeavors. The committee led an anti-Meschian campaign accusing him of anti-Soviet propaganda and calling the band members \u201CNewly Ordained Apostles.\u201D It was, in much part, due to the name calling, that the band was later named \u201CThe apostles.\u201D The remarkable success of the Apostles was not hindered by anti-Meschian Communist efforts. In early 1970\u2019s, Meschian composed the first Armenian rock opera, \u201CThe Insane Asylum\u201D which vastly contributed to the band\u2019s publicity. Thereafter, the band started giving concerts in numerous universities and cities such as Gyumri, Moscow, Yerevan and Tallinn. In 1971, Meschian gave an outstanding performance in the USSR festival for young musicians in Poland, where the band was only allowed to participate under the guidance of the Communist Committee Activists. Despite the fact that the Apostles found themselves performing in various republics throughout the Soviet Union, they always remained loyal to performing in their native Armenian. In 1972, Meschian successfully graduated from university, but due to the anti-Meschian attitudes infested in the Armenian Soviet Republic, it took him two years to find a job as an architect. In 1974, Meschian was employed by the Armenian Governmental Project where he participated in the development of Zvartnots Airport in Yerevan. In 1973, he briefly joined the chorus of the Mother See of Holy Etchmiadzin, where he made the acquaintance of his Holiness Vazgen I, the Catholicos of the Armenian Apostolic Church who commissioned him to write a requiem dedicated to the martyrs of the Armenian Genocide. With Moushegh Ishkhan\u2019s permission, Meschian used some of his verses in writing the requiem. In 1975, Meschian performed his requiem at the Mother See of Holy Etchmiadzin, and with the support of the Catholicos, he later recorded the masterpiece. In the beginning of the next decade, the Apostles, unexpectedly, disappeared from the musical arena. At the time of its existence, the band featured various musicians such as Ashot Adamyan, Gevorg Mangasaryan, Viguen Stepanyan, Gevorg Jangulyan, Movses Muradyan, Ashot Eghikyan, Stanislav Buniatyan, Rostom Ohanyan and Ashot Eghikyan. In 1984, Meschian started his own musical path with his students, Vahan Artsruni and Gourgen Melikyan. In 1980\u2019s, he also got leading roles in two motion pictures. He became a part of the film, The Glowing Fire of the Night, playing the role of Michael Nalbandian. That was an opportunity for him to have his songs included in the movie. The film gave him basis to do a professional recording in the Melodia Studio of Moscow. The film highlighted three of Meschian\u2019s works, \u201CAncient Land,\u201D \u201CEpitaph\u201D and \u201CResurrection.\u201D The second film he did was \"And, Everything will Recur,\" which came out in 1989, when Meschian had already moved to the United States. In early 1980\u2019s Meschian was the leader of the Armenian Industrial Project Studio of Architecture. At the time, he had supervised the reconstruction of Lazarian Seminary in Moscow (Later the Embassy of the Armenian Republic.) He also laid out the construction of the building of Admission for the Armenian government in Yerevan, the extension building to Matenadaran, the library of Manuscripts whose construction got delayed due to the 1988 earthquake and only resumed in 2007, when Meschain was back in Yerevan. In 1989, Meschian, along with his family, moved to Boston, where he finally managed to properly record his songs. In 1990, he started performing in places such as the Armenian Church of Boston, the center of Armenian Relief Fund and The Wilshire Ebell Theatre. In 1990, he recorded his first album called Catharisis. In addition, he formed a new band called Apostles 90 with Wayne Johnson on the guitar, John Leftwich on the bass and Art Rodrigues on the drums. In 1993, Meschian released yet another album called The Monologue of the Insane Violinist, and gave a series of concerts with Apostles 90 in Pasadena, CA. In 1995, Meschian released two other albums; Wander, which included a couple of songs from the Requiem and Communion which he deems the pinnacle of his musical career. In 1996 He first performed the Communion at the First Church of Nazarene in Pasadena. Later in the same year, his Communion was performed four days in a row at the National Academic Theater for Opera and Ballet in Yerevan. In 2001, Meschian released his hit collection featuring four CDs encompassing \u201CThe monologue of a Crazy Violinist,\u201D \u201CCatharsis\u201D, \u201CCatharsis 2\u201D and \u201CCommunion.\u201D In 2003, he gave a concert at the Kodak Theater (now Dolby Theatre ) where he presented his new songs, and performed the Sayat Nova piece. In 2005, after living in the United States for 17 years, Meschian and his wife returned to Armenia. There, he gave a series of concerts which were highly esteemed and appreciated by both the general public and his long term fans who had been loyal to his art since the Soviet times. In 2007, the construction of the new section of the Mesrop Mashtots Institute of Ancient Manuscripts begins under the guidance of the chief architect Arthur Meschian. Meschian worked very hard to finish the project before schedule in 2011. Notwithstanding his busy schedule, Meschian managed to give yet another concert tour in 2009. He performed in Yerevan, Moscow, and Pasadena LA. In 2015, architect Meschian finishes yet another project. This time, he designs and conceives the first newly-built museum of Komitas in Yerevan, Armenia In 2011, Arthur Meschian is awarded with the Mesrop Mashtots Medal. In 2012, Meschian is awarded with the golden medal of the office of public construction in Yerevan, Armenia. In 2013, he is awarded with the national accolade of the Armenian Republic for his Matenataran project. As of now, despite his huge musical success, Meschian is not in a hurry to present his new musical creations."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Brandon Paris (born Richard Lee, legally changed his name in 1998) was born on November 11, 1971 in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada and is the lead singer and front man for Brandon Paris Band. After graduating high school in 1989, he went to Red River College to study Criminology in hopes of joining the Winnipeg Police Service, but that same year dropped out. At the age of 18, Brandon started making T-shirts under a brand name he called \"Express Clothing\". He started selling T-shirts out of the trunk of his car; eventually, his clothing line was carried at two of the largest clothing chains in Canada (at the time), Bootlegger, and Below the Belt. The company dissolved after three years because of poor business decisions based on little experience. A three-year relationship ended with his girlfriend during the same week of the official dissolve of his business, which led to Brandon's attempted suicide in 1993. Brandon was admitted in St. Boniface hospital where he had his stomach pumped. One month later, his father talked him into moving to Surrey, BC to work for his multimedia company. Paris worked for 7 years as a digital video editing/3D animator helping build his fathers home based business into one of the most recognized video production/duplication companies in British Columbia. By 1998, Brandon became addicted to drugs which led him into a deep depression. This depression helped him find a new love for music, that he claims, helped him find his way out of his two-year drug addiction. In 1999 Paris left his fathers business to pursue a career in Music. He sold all of his belongings within two weeks, and moved to Long Beach, California with $7,000 cash in hopes of putting together a band. While eating only oatmeal everyday and living in cockroach infested apartments, Brandon immediately took vocal lessons and went to the library each day educating himself with books on song writing and the music business. After running out of money within 1 year, Brandon became desperate for money, and attained an illegal green card and visa papers. Only 2 weeks later he was soon caught and deported back to Canada. Brandon started writing and performing his own songs as a solo artist locally from 2001 to 2002. He independently financed the recording of his solo album which took two years to complete but released songs to radio with no success. With what took over three years, Brandon Paris's newly formed Band was completed. Brandon re-recorded half the album with Troy Samson of Hipjoint Productions (Moka Only, Kreesha Turner, Snoop Dogg) and Jeff Dawson  (State of Shock, Kelly Rowland, Daniel Powter, Marcy Playground), Paris officially changed the name from \"Brandon Paris\" to \"Brandon Paris Band\" in 2006 and decided they were finally ready to shop their debut album now titled On My Own. In January 2006, Brandon Paris Band signed a deal with Koch Entertainment literally overnight just days after sending out their album to record labels across Canada, with many offers following. Their debut albums' first single, \"Rewind and Start Again\", was a huge success on commercial radio after being released on March 13, 2006. The song climbed up to top 20 on the Canadian CHR charts (tracked by Radio & Records (Billboard Information Group)). The second and third singles, \"Somebody to Hold\" and \"Give Me a Reason\", were also well received in many cities but not enough to reach top 40 status in Canada. Topping off an already exceptional year, Brandon Paris Band was nominated for Best New Group or Solo Artist (CHR) by the Canadian Radio Music Awards in spring of 2007."@en ;

His playing of hard funk records of the sort typified by James Brown was an alternative both to the violent gang culture of the Bronx and to the nascent popularity of disco in the 1970s. Campbell began to isolate the instrumental portion of the record, which emphasized the drum beat\u2014the \"break\"\u2014and switch from one break to another. Using the same two turntable set-up of disco DJs, Campbell used two copies of the same record to elongate the break. This breakbeat DJing, using hard funk and records with Latin percussion, formed the basis of hip hop music. Campbell's announcements and exhortations to dancers helped lead to the syncopated, rhymed spoken accompaniment now known as rapping. He called his dancers \"break-boys\" and \"break-girls\", or simply b-boys and b-girls. Campbell's DJ style was quickly taken up by figures such as Afrika Bambaataa and Grandmaster Flash. Unlike them, he never made the move into commercially recorded hip hop in its earliest years."@en ;

He lives and works in Vienna and Kissing, Germany. In performances, publications and installations, Hecker deals with specific compositional developments of post-war modernity, electro-acoustic music as well as other, non-musical disciplines. He dramatizes space, time and self-perception in his sonic works by isolating specific auditory events in their singularity, thus stretching the boundaries of their materialization. Their objectual autonomy is exposed while simultaneously evoking sensations, memories and associations in an immersive intensity. Solo exhibitions include: MMK, Museum f\u00FCr Moderne Kunst, Frankfurt am Main, Germany; IKON Gallery, Birmingham and Chisenhale Gallery, London, all in 2010. Bawag Contemporary, Vienna, 2009; Sadie Coles HQ, London, 2008 and Galerie Neu, Berlin, 2007.

Primarily known as the founder and frontman for the Italian Art Rock band Nosound, he also has produced one album under the band name of Memories of Machines with Tim Bowness (notably of the band No-Man). Giancarlo moved from Italy to the UK in 2010 to work for KScope Records as a producer and engineer. Under Nosound he has produced four studio albums, two live albums, three ep's, and several promotional/demo recordings. The new live album Teide 2390 was released in March 2015. A second Memories of Machines album is planned, but there is currently no forecasted release date. In 2005, Giancarlo opened his own recording and production studio in Norfalk UK called The Bench Music initially to work on his own music, but has since opened it up as a commercial enterprise. In 2014, Giancarlo and Nosound were invited to play at the Starmus Festival on the island of Tenerife in the Canary Islands of Spain.

	dbo:abstract	"Glen Moffatt is a New Zealand country music singer-songwriter who relocated to Brisbane, Australia, in 2002. Moffatt was born in Hastings and raised in Napier. He was a newspaper journalist before moving to Auckland at the end of 1991. New Zealand music historian John Dix wrote of New Zealand music in the 1990s, \"It wasn't all alt.rock, hip hop and hard rock in the '90s. Country rock survived with recording acts like the Coalrangers (from the wild West Coast), Glen Moffatt, Ritchie Pickett, the Renderers and the Waltons. The most successful were the Warratahs, signed to Pagan.\" Moffatt's 1995 debut album Somewhere in New Zealand Tonight was described by New Zealand Herald music critic Graham Reid as the \"birth of a Kiwi classic\". It was a finalist in country album of the year at the 1996 New Zealand recording industry awards. Moffatt was also a finalist in the rising star and songwriter of the year categories. In 1998 he released follow-up A Place to Play, of which Reid wrote, \"Moffatt has written his name large again and is, after two strong showings, a talent too big to ignore\". In 2001, as Glen Moffatt Band, came his final New Zealand album If That's What You Want. Moffatt moved to Queensland in 2002, forming a band called Glen Moffatt & the Tallboys, and in 2007 he began working with long-time Brisbane band The Smokin' Crawdads. He sang six tracks on the Smokin' Crawdads album Straight to the Pool Room, which featured Sydney violinist Ian Cooper and was launched at the 2010 Tamworth country music festival. SDL Music (Scoop de Loop) released the compilation Troubadours - NZ Singer/Songwriter Series: Vol 1 in 2009 containing eight songs each from Moffatt, Al Hunter and Red McKelvie. Recorded in New Zealand and Australia over 18 months, Moffatt's Superheroes & Scary Things album was released in July 2014. During the same month, Sony Music NZ included his song \"Somewhere in New Zealand Tonight\" on their Godzone Country: The Very Best of New Zealand Country Music CD release. Moffatt's songs have appeared on albums by Bill Chambers, Ritchie Pickett and Dennis Marsh."@en ;

Because of his songwriting, wild personality, performances, and the dramatic circumstances surrounding his life and death, he is regarded by critics and fans as one of the most iconic and influential frontmen in rock music history. In the later part of the 20th century, he was one of the popular culture's most rebellious and oft-displayed icons, representing the generation gap and youth counterculture. He was also well known for improvising spoken word poetry passages while the band played live. Morrison was ranked number 47 on Rolling Stone's list of the \"100 Greatest Singers of All Time\", and number 22 on Classic Rock magazine's \"50 Greatest Singers In Rock\". Ray Manzarek said Morrison \"embodied hippie counterculture rebellion\". Morrison was sometimes referred to by other nicknames, such as \"Lizard King\" and \"King of Orgasmic Rock\". Morrison developed an alcohol dependency during the 1960s, which affected his performances on stage. He died at the age of 27 in Paris, apparently from an accidental heroin overdose. No autopsy was performed, and the exact cause of Morrison's death is still disputed. Morrison is interred at P\u00E8re Lachaise Cemetery in eastern Paris."@en ;

Jonas first rose to fame as a member of the pop-rock band Jonas Brothers, along with his brothers Kevin and Nick. The band's debut album, It's About Time (2006), was a commercial failure following a limited release. The group signed with Hollywood Records, and in 2007 released their eponymous second studio album. The album went on to be a commercial success for the group, selling over two million copies in the United States alone. The group became heavily involved with the Disney Channel, and later made their film debut in the Disney Channel Original Movie Camp Rock (2008). The film, and its soundtrack, became a major hit for the network, and helped propel the brothers into further commercial success. Their third studio album, A Little Bit Longer (2008), became their first to top the Billboard 200, and went on to become their highest selling album to date. The album's lead single became a top five hit in the United States. Their fourth studio album, Lines, Vines and Trying Times (2009) became their second to top the charts in the United States. The brothers also starred in two of their Disney Channel series from 2009 to 2010, being JONAS L.A. and Jonas Brothers: Living the Dream. In 2010, the group starred in Camp Rock 2: The Final Jam, reprising their roles from the original film. Joe release his solo debut studio album, Fastlife, in 2011, with the singles \"See No More\" and \"Just in Love\". The following year, it was confirmed that the Jonas Brothers would be reuniting and the fifth studio album was entitled V. But, in 2013, the Jonas ended the band and the album was cancelled. Following his departure from the band, Jonas began working as a songwriter for various artists. He began working on a new musical project for himself, though was unsure whether it would be his second studio album or a new project for a band. He ultimately decided to form a new band, DNCE, which made their debut with the single \"Cake by the Ocean\" (2015)."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Katheryn Elizabeth Hudson (born October 25, 1984), known professionally as Katy Perry, is an American singer and songwriter. After singing in church during her childhood, she pursued a career in gospel music as a teenager. Perry signed with Red Hill Records and released her debut studio album Katy Hudson under her birth name in 2001, which was commercially unsuccessful. She moved to Los Angeles the following year to venture into secular music after Red Hill ceased operations and she subsequently began working with producers Glen Ballard, Dr. Luke, and Max Martin. After adopting the stage name Katy Perry and being dropped by The Island Def Jam Music Group and Columbia Records, she signed a recording contract with Capitol Records in April 2007. Perry rose to fame in 2008 with the release of the singles \"I Kissed a Girl\" \u2013 which sparked controversy for its homosexual themes \u2013 and \"Hot n Cold\" from her second album, a pop rock record titled One of the Boys. Her third album, Teenage Dream (2010), ventured into disco, and contained the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 chart-topping singles \"California Gurls\", \"Teenage Dream\", \"Firework\", \"E.T.\", and \"Last Friday Night (T.G.I.F.)\" as well as the number-three single \"The One That Got Away\". The album became the first by a female artist to produce five number-one songs in the U.S., and the second overall after Michael Jackson's album Bad. In March 2012, she re-issued the album as Teenage Dream: The Complete Confection, which produced the songs \"Part of Me\" and \"Wide Awake\". Her fourth album, Prism, was released in 2013, and is influenced by pop and dance. She became the first artist with multiple videos to reach one billion views on Vevo with the videos for its songs \"Roar\" and \"Dark Horse\". Perry has received many awards, including four Guinness World Records, and been included in the Forbes list of \"Top-Earning Women In Music\" (2011\u201315). Her estimated net worth as of 2016 is $125 million. She is one of the best-selling musical artists of all time, having sold 100 million records globally throughout her career. In film, she released an autobiographical documentary titled Katy Perry: Part of Me in 2012, and voiced Smurfette in the 2011 film The Smurfs and its sequel in 2013."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Kym Purling is an Australian pianist, composer and conductor, who was found abandoned at 2\u20133 days of age during the Vietnam War. After spending the first several months of his life in two orphanages, he was later adopted at the age of nine months to Australia, becoming the first international adoption of any nationality in Australia. Purling began formal musical training at age five or six and received his high school education at Westminster School, a private school in Adelaide, South Australia. He later completed a Bachelor of Music in Jazz Studies at the University of Adelaide, South Australia, where he formed the first Kym Purling Trio. The trio received wide recognition all around Australia and also served as the rhythm section for many of Australia's leading jazz musicians and vocalists. During this time, still in his early twenties, Purling recorded his first albums, Trio Juice, Catherine Lambert & The Kym Purling Trio and Let's Swing! In 1996, Purling served as an Ambassador for the Performing Arts between Australia and Vietnam. This was Purling's first return to his homeland since his adoption. During Purling's ambassadorship, he held sold-out concerts in concerts halls around Ho Chi Minh City and Hanoi, introducing jazz to the Vietnamese people. During the residency, Purling also taught many children, students and professional musicians and made recordings for educational purposes. He featured in many newspaper articles and radio interviews during the time he spent in Vietnam. Purling's work in Vietnam crossed many cultural and language barriers, proving that music is the universal language. He did not know any of the Vietnamese language before arriving there. Purling returned to Australia and later moved to the United States where he currently resides. As a jazz pianist, composer, conductor, arranger and educator, Purling has performed and worked throughout Australia, Malaysia, Singapore, Vietnam, the United States, Canada, Japan, Brazil, France, the United Kingdom and the Netherlands. He has opened concerts for Julio Iglesias, Harry Connick Jr., Sandra Bernhard, James Morrison, The Ray Brown Trio and Arturo Sandoval and has performed with The Mills Brothers, Buddy Greco, Kay Starr, Clint Holmes, David Cassidy and many other well-known artists. He recently performed on an hour-long national US television show with Natalie Cole. Purling later located to New York City, and worked as a musical-director and conductor of touring Broadway shows and spent the following five years traveling around 49 U.S. states, Canada and Japan, with Broadway shows Footloose, 42nd Street and Miss Saigon. Purling was later appointed as musical director, conductor and pianist for vocal legend, Engelbert Humperdinck. With Humperdinck and his band, Purling conducted and performed in many of the world's most famous concert halls and arenas around the world. Purling is an avid traveler and continues to travel and perform constantly around the world. He is hired by many major high-end luxury cruise lines around the world to perform in their showrooms and theaters aboard their ships as a guest entertainer. Purling has traveled and performed in over one hundred countries around the world. A passionate humanitarian, Purling continues to present concerts to raise funds for humanitarian and aid projects worldwide. His most recent charity performance was on May 6, 2015 in St. Petersburg, Florida where he raised many thousands of dollars to benefit the people of the recent Nepal earthquakes."@en ;

Steff was born in Vineland, New Jersey. His father was a member of the gospel group Spirit, and his aunt\u2014Gina Thompson\u2014has worked with producer Rodney Jerkins. By 8, Steff traveled with and sang alongside his father's group, Spirit. Steff won talent shows, including the McDonald's Apollo kid's competition in Philadelphia, his path to success seemed relatively straightforward, especially at age 12 when his demo landed in the hands of then Roc-A-Fella Records executives Jay-Z and Damon Dash, and they signed him to their music label. While with the Roc, Steff had success and scored a hit with the song \"Can I Holla\" that featured Bow Wow. In 2005, Dame and Jay parted ways: Steff chose to become a free agent. After the controversial Roc-A-Fella split, Steff was led to super producer Rich Harrison (who produced hits such as Amerie \"1 Thing \", Jennifer Lopez \"Get Right\", and Beyonc\u00E9 \"Crazy In Love\") who offered to sign the young performer to his growing Richcraft label through Atlantic Records after an impromptu audition, with dancers in tow. Now since the controversial Roc-A-Fella Records split in 2005, Young Steff is back on track with a solo-record debut rumored to be titled \"Jump It Off\", which was due out September 18, 2008. Steff has described this album to be a young man's journey to adulthood with the wide-eyed wonderment of a boy still in awe of his sudden rise to R&B-icon status. Steff collaborated with Trick Daddy on the song \"Chevy\"."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Buddie Petit or Buddy Petit (ca. 1890? \u2013 4 July 1931) was a highly regarded American early jazz cornetist. His early life is somewhat mysterious, with dates of his birth given in various sources ranging from 1887 to 1897; if the later date is correct he was evidently a prodigy, regarded as one of the best in New Orleans, Louisiana, in his early teens. He was said to have been born in White Castle, Louisiana. His given name was Joseph Crawford, but he was adopted by the trombonist Joseph Petit, whose name he took. By the early 1910s, he was one of the top horn players in the new style of music not yet generally known as \"jazz\". He took Freddie Keppard's place in the Eagle Band (a place earlier held by Buddy Bolden) when Keppard left town. Buddie Petit was known as a hard-drinking, fun-loving man who played cornet with great virtuosity and inventiveness. He was briefly lured to Los Angeles, California, by Jelly Roll Morton and Bill Johnson in 1917, but objected to being told to dress and behave differently from what he was accustomed to back home, and promptly returned to New Orleans. He spent the rest of his career in the area around greater New Orleans and the towns north of Lake Pontchartrain like Mandeville, Louisiana, not venturing further from home than Baton Rouge and the Mississippi Gulf Coast. Okeh Records offered him a chance to record on their 1925 field trip to New Orleans, but Petit held out for more money and was never recorded. Musicians such as Danny Barker and Louis Armstrong have said that it is a great loss to jazz history that there are no recordings of Petit. Some of his contemporaries said that Louis Armstrong's record \"Cornet Chop Suey\" is the closest to Petit's style and sound of anything put on record."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"George Formby, OBE (born George Hoy Booth; 26 May 1904 \u2013 6 March 1961), was an English actor, singer-songwriter and comedian who became known to a worldwide audience through his films of the 1930s and 1940s. On stage, screen and record he sang light, comical songs, usually playing the ukulele or banjolele, and became the UK's highest-paid entertainer. Born in Wigan, Lancashire, he was the son of George Formby Sr, from whom he later took his stage name. After an early career as a stable boy and jockey, Formby took to the music hall stage after the early death of his father in 1921. His early performances were taken exclusively from his father's act, including the same songs, jokes and characters. In 1923 he made a career-changing decision \u2013 he purchased a ukulele, and in 1924 he married Beryl Ingham, a fellow performer who became his manager and transformed his act. She insisted that he appear on stage formally dressed, and introduced the ukulele to his performance. He started his recording career in 1926 and, from 1934, he increasingly worked in film to develop into a major star by the late 1930s and 1940s, and became the UK's most popular entertainer during those decades. The media historian Brian McFarlane writes that on film, Formby portrayed gormless Lancastrian innocents who would win through against some form of villainy, gaining the affection of an attractive middle-class girl in the process. During the Second World War Formby worked extensively for the Entertainments National Service Association (ENSA), and entertained civilians and troops, and by 1946 it was estimated that he had performed in front of three million service personnel. After the war his career declined, although he toured the Commonwealth, and continued to appear in variety and pantomime. His last television appearance was in December 1960, two weeks before the death of Beryl. He surprised people by announcing his engagement to a school teacher seven weeks after Beryl's funeral, but died in Preston three weeks later, at the age of 56; he was buried in Warrington, alongside his father. Formby's biographer, Jeffrey Richards, considers that the actor \"had been able to embody simultaneously Lancashire, the working classes, the people, and the nation\". Formby was considered Britain's first properly home-grown screen comedian. He was an influence on future comedians\u2014particularly Charlie Drake and Norman Wisdom\u2014and, culturally, on entertainers such as the Beatles, who referred to him in their music. Since his death Formby has been the subject of five biographies, two television specials and two works of public sculpture."@en ;

In the late 1980s, he was MC Shy-D's DJ and toured with him and the 2 Live Crew, as they performed at various venues across the country with other hip hop acts such as N.W.A. and Ice-T. After MC Shy-D left Luke Records, Toomp went on to DJ for JT Money and the Poison Clan. When the 2 Live Crew broke up he worked on an album with former group member Brotha Marquis, called Indecent Exposure, under the moniker 2 Nazty; the cover billed him as a member of the Poison Clan. In 2006, Toomp partnered with hip hop veteran Bernard Parks, Jr., to launch NZone Entertainment, their very own record label. DJ Toomp began to gain greater recognition by working with southern rapper T.I., who also hails from Atlanta, Georgia. They first worked together on T.I.'s 2001 debut I'm Serious, since then the two built a friendship and a work relationship, with him becoming T.I.'s main producer. Toomp was heavily involved in T.I.'s first four albums; together they brought trap music into the mainstream. Toomp then received critical acclaim in 2006, for producing T.I.'s hit single \"What You Know\", which peaked at #3 on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100, The song earned both Toomp and T.I. their first Grammy Award. In 2007, DJ Toomp was recruited by American rapper and fellow record producer Kanye West, to contribute production on his third album Graduation. Toomp, alongside West, co-produced the singles \"Can't Tell Me Nothing\" and \"Good Life\", as well as the album's outro \"Big Brother\", an ode to West's brotherly friendship with fellow American rapper Jay-Z."@en ;

The album featured production from well known producers such as Dr. Dre and the Trackmasters and generated much hype. The group disbanded after just this one album. In 1998 AZ released his second solo album, Pieces of a Man. The album fared well but did not chart quite as well as his debut and did not feature a crossover single like \"Sugar Hill\". The same year AZ made a cameo appearance in the movie \"Belly\" starring Nas, DMX, and Method Man. After this album's release, AZ signed with Motown/Universal Records and released 9 Lives. In 2002, he released Aziatic. A single from the album, \"The Essence,\" (featuring Nas) was nominated for the 2003 Grammy Awards for Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group. In 2004 AZ was planning on releasing his would-be 4th studio album, Final Call, however, it was eventually scrapped due to heavy leaking and released as Final Call (The Lost Tapes) in 2008. He released his 5th and 6th studio albums A.W.O.L. and The Format in 2005 and 2006, respectively. In 2015, AZ self-published and released a Book titled Jewels, Gems & Treasures. The release got the proper respect and sales that lead AZ to prep on shooting a mini movie based on the book to be released late 2017. Also in 2016 AZ teamed up with B.E.T. to release his 20 year anniversary Documentary narrated by Rakim; which included Nas, Raekwon, Foxy Brown, Pete Rock, Premier and others.

A multi-instrumentalist primarily known as a guitarist and singer, Belew is noted for his unusual, impressionistic approach to guitar playing (which, rather than relying on standard instrumental tones, often resembles sound effects or noises made by animals and machines). Perhaps best known for his long stint as frontman and second guitarist for the progressive rock group King Crimson (between 1981 and 2009), Belew is widely recognized as an \"incredibly versatile player\" who has released nearly twenty solo albums for Island Records and Atlantic Records blending or alternating Beatles-inspired pop-rock with more experimental fare. Belew is a member of the intermittently-active pop band The Bears, and fronted his own band GaGa in the late 1970s and early 1980s. He has worked extensively as a session and touring musician - most famously with Talking Heads, David Bowie, Frank Zappa, Laurie Anderson and Nine Inch Nails - as well as contributing to hit singles by Paul Simon, Tom Tom Club and others. Belew himself scored a Top 10 hit single in 1989 with \"Oh Daddy\", and his 2005 single \"Beat Box Guitar\" was nominated for a Grammy in the Best Rock Instrumental Performance category. Belew has also worked in instrument design and multimedia, collaborating with Parker Guitars (to help design his own Parker Fly signature guitar) and designing his own iOS mobile apps FLUX by belew\u2122 and FLUX:FX.

	dbo:abstract	"Alexandra Imelda Cecelia Ewen Burke (born 25 August 1988) is a British singer-songwriter and voice actor. Burke was exposed to music from an early age, with her mother, Melissa Bell, being the lead singer of Soul II Soul. Burke rose to fame after winning the fifth series of British television series The X Factor in 2008, becoming the first of two winners to be mentored by Cheryl Cole and also, the second of three people in the girls category to win the series, the first being Leona Lewis in 2006 and the third being Louisa Johnson in 2015. Burke currently stands as one of the most successful winners of The X Factor. She was previously signed to three record labels: Epic Records, RCA Records and Syco Music, until she departed in June 2013 due to creative differences. After winning The X Factor, Burke released the winner's single \"Hallelujah\", which became the European record holder for single sales over a period of 24 hours, selling 105,000 in one day until it was overtaken by her X Factor mentor Cheryl Cole with her debut solo single \"Fight for This Love\". The song also became the top-selling single of 2008 in the UK and the UK's Christmas 2008 number one. By January 2009, the single had sold over 1 million copies in the UK alone, a first for a British female soloist. In 2009, Burke released her debut album, Overcome, which debuted at number one on the UK Albums Chart and spawned four number-one singles on the UK Singles Chart and the Irish Singles Chart\u2014\"Hallelujah\", \"Bad Boys\", selling over 780,000 copies in the UK and becoming a Platinum selling single, \"All Night Long\" and \"Start Without You\"\u2014and the album became one of the most successful albums of that year in the UK, the singles released from the album earned her three BRIT Award nominations. The album also saw the release of UK top 10 hit, \"Broken Heels\" and \"The Silence\". In late 2010, Burke released a deluxe version of Overcome. Overcome and the six singles released from the album have sold over four million record in the UK alone. \"Elephant\" was released as Burke's comeback single in February 2012, which became a hit single, with a peak position of number three in the UK. \"Let It Go\" served as the second single and Burke's second album, Heartbreak on Hold, was released in June 2012. In June 2014, Burke replaced Beverley Knight in the lead role of Rachel Marron in the West End musical The Bodyguard, at the Adelphi Theatre until its closure on 29 August 2014. On 17 October 2014 it was announced Alexandra would again star as Rachel Marron in the UK and Ireland nationwide tour of The Bodyguard musical. The tour commenced on 12 February 2015 in Southampton, and concluded in Monaco on June 26th 2016. This made Burke the only actress to perform in both the West End and nationwide versions of the production, and spanning 24 months, the longest leading cast member to play Rachel Marron. Continuing with musical theatre Alexandra commenced a 12-month residency in Sister Act The Musical. Opening for previews at the Leicester Curve Theatre on 30th July 2016 Alexandra leads the cast as Deloris Van Cartier. Alexandra is due to release her third album in late 2017"@en ;

Having released 12 studio albums and 44 singles since 1992, he is best known for his number one single \"Achy Breaky Heart\", which became the first single ever to achieve triple Platinum status in Australia. It was also the best-selling single in the same country in 1992 and was translated into more than 100 languages. Thanks to the video of this hit, the line dance catapulted into the mainstream, becoming a worldwide craze. Cyrus, a multi-platinum selling recording artist, has scored a total of eight top-ten singles on the Billboard Country Songs chart. His most successful album to date is his debut Some Gave All, which has been certified 9\u00D7 Multi-Platinum in the United States and is the longest time spent by a debut artist at number one on the Billboard 200 (17 consecutive weeks) and most consecutive chart-topping weeks in the SoundScan era.

	dbo:abstract	"Bob Dylan (/\u02C8d\u026Al\u0259n/; born Robert Allen Zimmerman, May 24, 1941) is an American songwriter, singer, artist, and writer. He has been influential in popular music and culture for more than five decades. Much of his most celebrated work dates from the 1960s when his songs chronicled social unrest. Early songs such as \"Blowin' in the Wind\" and \"The Times They Are a-Changin'\" became anthems for the American civil rights and anti-war movements. Leaving behind his initial base in the American folk music revival, his six-minute single \"Like a Rolling Stone\", recorded in 1965, enlarged the range of popular music. Dylan's lyrics incorporate a wide range of political, social, philosophical, and literary influences. They defied existing pop music conventions and appealed to the burgeoning counterculture. Initially inspired by the performances of Little Richard and the songwriting of Woody Guthrie, Robert Johnson, and Hank Williams, Dylan has amplified and personalized musical genres. His recording career, spanning more than 50 years, has explored the traditions in American song\u2014from folk, blues, and country to gospel, rock and roll, and rockabilly to English, Scottish, and Irish folk music, embracing even jazz and the Great American Songbook. Dylan performs with guitar, keyboards, and harmonica. Backed by a changing lineup of musicians, he has toured steadily since the late 1980s on what has been dubbed the Never Ending Tour. His accomplishments as a recording artist and performer have been central to his career, but songwriting is considered his greatest contribution. Since 1994, Dylan has published six books of drawings and paintings, and his work has been exhibited in major art galleries. As a musician, Dylan has sold more than 100 million records, making him one of the best-selling artists of all time. He has also received numerous awards including eleven Grammy Awards, a Golden Globe Award, and an Academy Award. Dylan has been inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, Minnesota Music Hall of Fame, Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame, and Songwriters Hall of Fame. The Pulitzer Prize jury in 2008 awarded him a special citation for \"his profound impact on popular music and American culture, marked by lyrical compositions of extraordinary poetic power.\" In May 2012, Dylan received the Presidential Medal of Freedom from President Barack Obama. In 2016, he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature, the first to receive this honor for songwriting."@en ;

Budgie was hailed in 2013 by peer Stewart Copeland of The Police as one of the 16 most interesting drummers. Copeland described Budgie's playing as \"very economical and offbeat\", adding, \"Budgie didn\u2019t play your standard hi-hat-kick-snare; there were a lot of tom-toms and a big throb.\" Ari Up of The Slits praised him as \"a very sensitive drummer\".

He was recognized as the century's outstanding performer, with nearly 18% of the total vote, edging out Elvis Presley and Bob Dylan. He has sung for presidents, popes and royalty, as well as at humanitarian events. In response to the 1988 Armenian earthquake, he founded the charitable organization Aznavour for Armenia along with his long-time friend impresario Levon Sayan.

He is best known for his music, which often includes social, economic and cultural commentary on Brazil and Rio de Janeiro in particular. Son of the academic S\u00E9rgio Buarque de Hollanda, Buarque lived in several locations throughout his childhood, though mostly in Rio de Janeiro, S\u00E3o Paulo and Italy. He wrote and studied literature as a child and came to music through the bossa nova compositions of Tom Jobim and Jo\u00E3o Gilberto. He performed music throughout the 1960s as well as writing a play that was deemed dangerous by the Brazilian military dictatorship of the time. Buarque, along with several of his fellow musicians, was threatened by the government and eventually left Brazil in 1969. He moved to Italy again. However, he came back to Brazil in 1970, and continued to record albums, perform, and write, though much of his material was not allowed by government censors. He released several more albums in the 1980s and published three novels in the 1990s and 2000s, all of which were acclaimed critically."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Mary Isobel Catherine Bernadette O'Brien OBE  (16 April 1939 \u2013 2 March 1999), known professionally as Dusty Springfield, was an English pop singer and record producer whose career extended from the late 1950s to the 1990s. With her distinctive sensual mezzo-soprano sound, she was an important blue-eyed soul singer and at her peak was one of the most successful British female performers, with six top 20 singles on the United States Billboard Hot 100 and sixteen on the United Kingdom Singles Chart from 1963 to 1989. She was a member of both the US Rock and Roll and UK Music Halls of Fame. International polls have named Springfield among the best female rock artists of all time. Her image, supported by a peroxide blonde bouffant hairstyle, evening gowns, and heavy make-up, as well as her flamboyant performances on the black and white television of the 1960s, made her an icon of the Swinging Sixties. Born in West Hampstead, London to a family that enjoyed music, Springfield learned to sing at home. In 1958 she joined her first professional group, The Lana Sisters, and two years later formed a pop-folk vocal trio, The Springfields, with her brother Tom. Her solo career began in 1963 with the upbeat pop hit, \"I Only Want to Be with You\". Among the hits that followed were \"Wishin' and Hopin'\u2009\" (1964), \"I Just Don't Know What to Do with Myself\" (1964), \"You Don't Have to Say You Love Me\" (1966), and \"Son of a Preacher Man\" (1968). As a fan of US pop music, she brought many little-known soul singers to the attention of a wider UK record-buying audience by hosting the first national TV performance of many top-selling Motown artists beginning in 1965. Although she was never considered a Northern Soul artist in her own right, her efforts contributed a great deal to the formation of the genre as a result. Partly owing to these efforts, a year later she eventually became the best-selling female singer in the world and topped a number of popularity polls, including Melody Maker's Best International Vocalist. She was the first UK singer to top the New Musical Express readers' poll for Female Singer. To boost her credibility as a soul artist, Springfield went to Memphis, Tennessee to record Dusty in Memphis, an album of pop and soul music with the Atlantic Records main production team. Released in 1969, it has been ranked among the greatest albums of all time by the US magazine Rolling Stone and in polls by VH1 artists, New Musical Express readers, and Channel 4 viewers. The album was also awarded a spot in the Grammy Hall of Fame. Despite its current recognition, the album did not sell well and after its release, Springfield experienced a career slump for several years. However, in collaboration with Pet Shop Boys, she returned to the Top 10 of the UK and US charts in 1987 with \"What Have I Done to Deserve This?\" Two years later, she had two other UK hits on her own with \"Nothing Has Been Proved\" and \"In Private.\" Subsequently in the mid-1990s, owing to the inclusion of \"Son of a Preacher Man\" on the Pulp Fiction soundtrack, interest in her early output was revived."@en ;
