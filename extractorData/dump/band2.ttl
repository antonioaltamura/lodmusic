	dbo:abstract	"Zao /\u02C8ze\u026A.o\u028A/ is a metalcore band from Parkersburg, West Virginia. Founded in March 1993, Zao has hosted several musicians and endured numerous roster changes to the point where no original members remain. Former drummer Jesse Smith, singer Daniel Weyandt, and guitarists Scott Mellinger & Russ Cogdell are seen by most fans as the \"core\" of Zao. Christianity has been a key influence in the band's work; because the founding members claimed to have a strong relationship with God, they were considered a devoted Christian band, which changed as time passed. Former drummer Jesse Smith slowly changed the band's vision. Because only half the band's members identified themselves as Christians, Zao no longer considered itself a Christian band but rather a group of open-minded artists. Lyrics in future productions may or may not include Christian messages, but Zao has stated they would have loved to return to the Christian Cornerstone Festival when it was still active. As of 2015, only one member of the band claims Christianity as their beliefs. To date, Zao has completed ten full-length albums, four EPs, a two-disc DVD documentary and multiple concert tours, garnering a limited but global fanbase and earning critical praise in the process."@en ;

Their original line-up included founder and guitarist Dominic Scott, who left in 2001. Keane immediately achieved mainstream, international success with the release of their debut album, Hopes and Fears, in 2004. Topping the UK charts, the album won several awards, including the 2005 Brit Award for Best British Album. It was the second best-selling British album of 2004. Their second album, Under the Iron Sea, released in 2006, continued the band's success, topping the UK album charts and debuting at number four on the US Billboard 200. Their third album, Perfect Symmetry, was released in October 2008. In May 2008, both Hopes and Fears (number 13) and Under the Iron Sea (number 8) were voted by readers of Q magazine as among the best British albums ever, with Keane, The Beatles, Oasis and Radiohead the only artists having two albums in the top 20. In 2009, Hopes and Fears was listed as the ninth best-selling album of the 2000s decade in the UK. Their EP, Night Train, was released in May 2010. Their fourth studio album, Strangeland, was released in May 2012, and again peaked at number one on the UK Albums Chart. Keane are known for using a piano (or a synth) as the lead instrument instead of guitars, differentiating them from most other rock bands. The inclusion of a distorted piano effect in 2006 and various synthesisers were a common feature in their music that back then combined the piano rock sound[not in citation given] used during their first album and the more electronic sound which developed on the second and third albums. Since the start of their career, the band have sold over 10 million albums worldwide."@en ;

In 1989, Ash met fellow original member Steve Davis, in London while both were working as DJs. Before forming Rogue Traders, the pair had worked together on many projects, including the dance music act, Union State which relocated to Melbourne in 1992. The group's name comes from the 1999 drama film, Rogue Trader. They were joined in 2004 by soap opera actress, Natalie Bassingthwaighte, on lead vocals and Cameron McGlinchey on drums. Rogue Traders have achieved chart success in Australia, with seven Top 20 hits on the ARIA Singles Chart, \"One of My Kind\", \"Voodoo Child\", \"Way to Go!\", \"Watching You\", \"We're Coming Home\", \"Don't You Wanna Feel\" and \"I Never Liked You\". Their most successful single, \"Voodoo Child\", peaked at number three on the UK Singles Chart, number four in Australia, number seven on the New Zealand Singles Chart and number fifteen on the Irish Singles Chart. The group's two Top 5 albums in Australia are Here Come the Drums (2005) and Better in the Dark (2007). In 2007 Here Comes the Drums was certified 4\u00D7 platinum by ARIA for shipment of 280,000 copies, while Better in the Dark was certified platinum in 2008. As of 2008, Rogue Traders have been nominated for ten ARIA Awards, three MTV AVMA Awards, one The Nickelodeon Kids' Choice Awards, one Inside Film Award, and eight APRA Awards. After leaving Rogue Traders in 2006, Davis continued to contribute to the band and is a part of the songwriting process. He was replaced on guitar by Tim Henwood, who left in 2007. In June 2008 Bassingthwaighte, quit the band to focus on her acting and solo music career. In July that year her boyfriend (they later married), McGlinchey, also left the band. In August 2009, Ash revealed that Henwood had returned and his replacement, Danny Spencer, had left. In November that year, Mindi Jackson was revealed as the new lead singer to replace Bassingthwaighte. Peter Marin joined on drums to replace McGlinchey. The band was dropped by Sony Records in 2010, and split shortly afterwards. Their fourth studio album and greatest hits compilation, The Sound of Drums, was released after their split in November 2011. On the 15th of December 2015, it was announced that the group had reformed for at least one reunion gig with former lead singer Natalie Bassingthwaighte."@en ;

Most members of the group have contributed compositions to their catalog of original songs, as have Robert Parr (Tom's brother) and schoolteacher Scott Taylor (who writes lyrics for some of Henneman's tunes). As noted in the New York Times by William Hogeland, the Bottle Rockets' songwriting has been likened to Woody Guthrie's folk style in spirit, smarts, and satire. The band's lyrics encapsulate the common experiences of the everyman, and are set to rousing and searing rock 'n' roll. Considered to be the leaders of the '90s alt-country/roots rock revival along with peers Uncle Tupelo, the Bottle Rockets are contemporary storytellers from Middle America.

After a change of personnel in April 1967, the band changed their name to Art, and released the album Supernatural Fairy Tales. They also participated to a psychedelic bizarre album called Featuring The Human Host And The Heavy Metal Kids by a collective known as Haphash And The Multi Coloured Coat, formed by Guy Stevens and an influential British graphic design and avant-garde musical partnership between Michael English and Nigel Waymouth. The musicians involved in that project were Mike Harrison on keys and vocals, Luther Grosvenor on guitars, Greg Ridley on bass and Mike Kellie on drums, as well as performances by Guy Stevens, Michael English and Nigel Waymouth. It was the first time that the term heavy metal was ever used in music, even though that album had nothing to do with heavy metal, being closer to psychedelic music. That album was published in 1967 on Liberty Records and contained only five songs from two minutes to more than 15 minutes of psychedelic and almost meditative state kind of music."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"The Miami Horns are an American horn section best known for touring and recording with Southside Johnny, Bruce Springsteen, Little Steven and The Max Weinberg 7. They have also toured, performed or recorded with, among others, Diana Ross, Gary U.S. Bonds, Robert Cray, Bon Jovi, Cissy Houston, Joe Cocker, Dave Edmunds, Darlene Love, The Allman Brothers Band, Eric Clapton, Sheryl Crow and Ricky Martin. As individuals, the various members have also worked with the likes of Aerosmith, David Bowie, Duran Duran, Power Station, Graham Parker and They Might Be Giants. The Miami Horns were first put together in 1976 by Steve Van Zandt as part of Southside Johnny & The Asbury Jukes. The connection with the city of Miami is only tenuous. Van Zandt had acquired the nickname Miami, due to his dislike of winter, and consequently the horn section also became known by that name. On occasions they have also been billed as The Jukes' Horns, La Bamba's Mambomen, The U.S. Horns, The J.A.M. Horns, The Tunnel Of Love Horns, The Horns of Love and The Late Night Horns. The line-up is very much impromptu and seems to depend on who is available at the time. As a consequence it has varied in size from a duo to a big band. Not unlike The Drifters, many performers have come and gone, and even returned. However Richie \"La Bamba\" Rosenberg (trombone), Mark Pender (trumpet) and Eddie Manion (saxophone) have been the most consistent members. Other notable players have included Stan Harrison, Chris Anderson, Joey Stann and Mario Cruz. In 1991 Rosenberg, Pender, Manion and Harrison recorded an eponymous album as La Bamba & The Hubcaps."@en ;

They started off in the local punk rock scene and set the trend \u2013 singing rock tunes in Portuguese. After three decades of studio and live albums, Xutos & Pontap\u00E9s continue to be considered Portugal's top rock band, still influencing new generations of Portuguese bands. In 2004, then Portuguese President Jorge Sampaio granted the band a state decoration for 25 years of career achievements in the music industry. On 26 September 2009, they played in Lisbon to a packed football stadium, Est\u00E1dio do Restelo, to commemorate their 30th anniversary. They played for three hours \u2013 each hour marking a decade of their steadily successful career. It was the first time seven screens were used on stage in Portugal. Current members are most of the original line up Tim (bass/ vocals), Z\u00E9 Pedro (guitar), Jo\u00E3o Cabeleira (guitar \u2013 since 1983), Kal\u00FA (drums/ backing vocals) and Gui (sax/ backing vocals). Fans refer to the band as Xutos; and Xutos is pronounced 'shootoosh'. Both 'xutos' and 'pontap\u00E9s' are words in reference to types of kicks, but with a twist because the first word when spelled \"Chutos\" is referred for kick on a ball or object, but here used as \"'xutos\", slang for Heroin injection, while 'pontap\u00E9s' for kicks mainly on persons."@en ;

Since then, Kayo Dot's lineup has drastically changed over the years. Toby Driver is the only founding member of the band still remaining, save for frequent lyrical contributions from former motW member Jason Byron, culminating in a guest track on the Hubardo album. Up until 2011, the lineup was constantly shifting, and Kayo Dot's sound consistently changed over the years, featuring a wide variety of instrumentation featuring guitar, drums, bass, violin, saxophone, vibraphone, synthesizers, clarinets and flutes. Underground metal audiences warmly received the group upon its early existence, with the 2003 album Choirs of the Eye and the 2006 album Dowsing Anemone with Copper Tongue both becoming underground hits in the progressive metal scene. Over the years, in addition to the rotating lineup and constantly changing sounds, Kayo Dot has been signed to a number of different record labels, Tzadik, Robotic Empire, Hydra Head before taking to Kickstarter and pre-orders to crowdfund their albums, as to be free of record label interference. The group signed to The Flenser in 2014. As of 2014, Kayo Dot has released seven studio albums, one EP and one split, Choirs of the Eye in 2003, Dowsing Anemone with Copper Tongue as well as Kayo Dot/Bloody Panda Split in 2006, Blue Lambency Downward, Coyote in 2010, an EP titled Stained Glass in 2011, Gamma Knife in 2012 and a double-album Hubardo in 2013. Coffins on Io, the group's seventh album, was released on October 16, 2014 via The Flenser."@en ;

Turilli developed the band to focus on his ability on the keyboard as his previous two projects mainly demonstrated his talent on the guitar and drums.

Fans have speculated Mystique's identity to be Bridget Fogle, who contributed to Turilli's 3rd album The Infinite Wonders of Creation, but as of 2015, this has not been confirmed. Shortly after the release of Lost Horizons, Turilli began work on a second Dreamquest album. In December 2006, it was reported that only the mixing was left to be completed.

Until his death in 2008, the band often featured guest vocals and percussion by Jimmy Carl Black, former drummer and vocalist from Zappa's Mothers of Invention, with whom they also performed songs by Captain Beefheart. Since their debut, the Muffin Men have featured no less than seven original Zappa band members, along with original Mothers Of Invention drummer/vocalist Jimmy Carl Black, as well as performing with Don Preston and Bunk Gardner in 1993. In 1994 they played a nine-week European tour with guest vocalist Ike Willis, and again teamed up with Willis in 2003 for a special Zappanale festival show, which also featured Napoleon Murphy Brock. (Zappanale is a yearly tribute concert festival dedicated to Frank Zappa's compositions.) Mike Keneally has also appeared with the band, along with Ray White, and Robert Martin. Denny Walley has performed on several occasions since 2010. Rather than play pieces note-for-note, the band plays Zappa's material working to the strengths of the current line-up, often giving the music a different slant to the original versions. 25th anniversary gigs (2015) feature a core line-up of 3 original members - Rhino, Jumpy and Roddie, with Phil Hearn on keys."@en ;

The name Pl\u00E1hnetan is a game-word, since the word pl\u00E1neta means planet, but with the addition of the h, the ending part formed is hneta, which mean nut. Therefore, its name could be translated as the planut. In those days Stef\u00E1n and bassist Fri\u00F0rik Sturluson were in the band S\u00E1lin hans J\u00F3ns m\u00EDns while Ing\u00F3lfur Gu\u00F0j\u00F3nsson and Sigur\u00F0ur Gr\u00F6ndal had quit their band Lo\u00F0in Rotta, so they called drummer Ing\u00F3lfur Sigur\u00F0sson, who up to that moment had been playing in bands like S\u00ED\u00F0an Skein S\u00F3l (a.k.a. S.S.S\u00F3l) and Rau\u00F0ir Fletir. The band contacted Steinar Berg \u00CDsleifsson, the owner of label Sk\u00EDfan and got a record deal, which allowed them to released their debut album in June the same year under the title of Speis (Icelandic for Space), a work which dealt with the concept of space and got good reviews by the critics. Some of the songs became very popular and the band took the chance to tour the country to promote the album.After this album, singer Stef\u00E1n released a solo album called L\u00EDf (Life) with the help of the band. By 1994 Fri\u00F0rik left the band and was replaced by bassist Jakob Sm\u00E1ri Magn\u00FAsson, who was known by playing in Tappi T\u00EDkarrass, MX-21 and S.S.S\u00F3l. the new line-up released an album in June called Plast (Plastic) which featured singer Bj\u00F6rgvin Halld\u00F3rsson in the song \u201C\u00C9g Vissi \u00DEa\u00F0\u201D.By the fall Pl\u00E1hnetan released one single called S\u00E6la with the collaboration of singer Emil\u00EDana Torrini.

	dbo:abstract	"The Naked Trucker and T-Bones Show is a live musical comedy act. The pair can frequently be seen as an act at the Largo nightclub, an alternative comedy hotspot in Los Angeles. The two \"frontmen\" of the band, The Naked Trucker and Gerald \"T-Bones\" Tibbons are played by actors Dave \"Gruber\" Allen and David Koechner, respectively. The show consists of catchy songs and long, humorous stories of life on the road. The Naked Trucker sings and plays guitar, usually wearing nothing more than his red hat and boots. He is a coffee-fueled long-haul trucker who embraces his own nudity as the ultimate example of American freedom. T-Bones is a freeloading drifter who's rarely seen without his ball-peen hammer or bottle of sweet wine. Often underestimated, T-Bones surprises many, including Trucker, with his cunning and depth of knowledge. The duo has performed live on Late Night with Conan O'Brien as well as Real Time with Bill Maher. They also have played various dates with Tenacious D. Their signature song, \"My American Dream,\" features a unique description of an ideal America. T-Bones also sings \"My Daddy Is an Astronaut,\" a tragicomic tale of his fatherless childhood believing that Buzz Aldrin is his dad. The Naked Trucker and T-Bones Show was picked up by the Comedy Central channel for eight episodes. The television show is a combination of live performances and pre-taped segments highlighting stories from their travels. It premiered at 10:30 PM EST on 2007-01-17. The show received mixed reviews, averaging 52% on Metacritic. The two were featured on comedy bits in the CD release of The Alter Boys, providing comedy stints in between numerous songs on that CD."@en ;

It was not until a year later when Das Oath started to play shows. With only one 7\" released the band hit the road and played all over Europe during the fall of 2000. Upon their return to The Netherlands the band went straight into the studio to record songs for what would become their 9\" / 10\" record. After the recording session the band started to prepare for their first USA tour slated in December 2000. Shows took place on the Westcoast tour in the USA with Total Fury from Japan. One of the highlights was the show at Gilman in Berkeley with Spazz. The tour barely broke even, yet more tours in Europe (with The Locust) and the USA (with Limpwrist and Total Fury). Meanwhile, the limited 10\" version came out for the spring tour on the Eastcoast. The regular 9\" version was finally released late 2001. Shortly upon its released it was banned by the distributor for its controversial artwork. Their self-conscious move away from a typical punk rock aesthetic presaged a signing to Dim Mak Records, an extremely varied and commercial label that released Das Oath's most critically well-received release, their self-titled LP from 2004. A mini-LP saw release in 2006 through Youth Attack, with the compact disc released again by Dim Mak. 2006 also saw the release of a self-titled 11\" on Youth Attack/Coalition with the compact disc on 31G and Das Oath's funereal release, a tour-only all-covers split LP with Ampere. Das Oath featured former/current members of Holy Molar, Failures, Monster X, Charles Bronson, VMW, Mainstrike, Devoid of Faith and Oil."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"The Mahotella Queens is a South African female group formed in 1964 by music producer Rupert Bopape. Originally a studio recording group consisting of around five or six singers, the current line-up of the Queens comprises Hilda Tloubatla, Nobesuthu Mbadu and Amanda Nkosi. The group is noted for their distinct vocal harmony sound, guitar-led mbaqanga music and fast-paced stage dancing. Bopape was a talent scout and producer at the independent Gallo Africa's then-subsidiary dedicated to black music, Mavuthela Music Company. He formed the Mahotella Queens as the company's resident girl group and the ensemble, often led by the deep-voiced male vocals of Simon 'Mahlathini' Nkabinde, went on to have many hit records during the 1960s. The Queens line-up during this period usually comprised Hilda Tloubatla, Juliet Mazamisa, Ethel Mngomezulu, Nobesuthu Mbadu and Mildred Mangxola. The Queens and Mahlathini were backed by Mavuthela's house band, the Makgona Tsohle Band (comprising several talented instrumentalists including Marks Mankwane on lead guitar and West Nkosi on alto saxophone). In 1972 the line-up of the Mahotella Queens disintegrated after royalty disagreements with Bopape; Mahlathini left the company in a similar dispute with the producer. However, with a change of membership, the Queens remained productive and popular into the 1970s and 1980s. In 1987, following the explosion of interest in South African music, the Queens line-up was rejigged and three of its original singers \u2013 Hilda Tloubatla, Nobesuthu Mbadu and Mildred Mangxola \u2013 returned to the group. In combination with Mahlathini, the group forged a successful international touring career that lasts to this day. In spite of the deaths of Mahlathini, Marks Mankwane and West Nkosi during the late 1990s, the Mahotella Queens continue to perform and record in the 21st century. In 2013, long-serving member Mildred Mangxola retired from the group. She was replaced by a new recruit, Amanda Nkosi."@en ;

Pendulum originally formed in the Australian city of Perth, Western Australia by Rob Swire, Gareth McGrillen, and Paul Harding. Rob and Gareth also constitute the electro house duo Knife Party (the original Australian members). The group was notable for a distinctive sound, mixing hard rock with electronic music, and developing to cover a wider range of genres. Swire and McGrillen were members of the metal band known as Xygen. After hearing Konflict's \"Messiah\" at a club, they were inspired to enter into the Drum & Bass genre. They founded Pendulum with Paul Harding, who was a veteran DJ in the Drum & Bass scene. In 2003 the band relocated to the United Kingdom. While Hold Your Colour holds true to the Drum & Bass genre, Pendulum have since experimented with mixing other genres into their work, as can be heard on In Silico and Immersion. In August 2013, Swire announced that a new album may be released \"some time next year\" (2014), although Swire and McGrillen later confessed on their Reddit AMA that they had become disillusioned with Pendulum and have no interest at present in producing any new material. Despite this, on December 16, 2015, Pendulum were confirmed to be reuniting to perform at the Ultra Music Festival in Miami, Florida, marking their official return as a live band."@en ;

dbr:ArnoCorps	rdf:type	dbo:Band ;
	dbo:abstract	"ArnoCorps is a rock music group based in San Francisco, CA. The band combines a militaristic appearance with a musical style rooted in skate punk and heavy metal. Describing their music as Action Adventure Hardcore Rock and Roll, the focus of the band is on energetic live performances which feature interaction with the audience. Attendees and fans are referred to by the band as \"Goddamn Heroes and Sheroes.\" ArnoCorps is the world's first band to feature lyrics based exclusively on the films of Arnold Schwarzenegger, with particular emphasis on his action roles from the 1980s such as The Terminator, Predator and Total Recall, with many of the lyrics paralleling movie dialogue and plots, similar to The Misfits' lyrical focus on horror films and B-movies. As a further part of their concept, ArnoCorps claim to be inspired by ancient folklore and mythology originating from the alps of their \"native\" Austria, suggesting that there are actually sociological and philosophical topics being addressed in their lyrics. ArnoCorps went further to charge several Hollywood movie studios with \"stealing\" the lore and mythology of Austria for plot material and dialogue in the films they have parodied. In 2004 the band attempted to launch a class-action lawsuit against the studios on behalf of the Austrian people, although the case failed to go to court. The band's stage show sees all six members dressed in combat fatigues and camouflage paint (most likely inspired by Predator and Commando) and address the audience in \"ballsy\" accents. Each band member uses a pseudonym and have heroic backstories. ArnoCorps often performs with two bass players in their line-up (an arrangement they refer to as \"heroic symmetry\"). After releasing two self-produced EPs in 2000 and 2001, the band built a fan following in the San Francisco Bay Area. The band's full length concept album was announced for release in 2005, titled The Greatest Band Of All Time, and produced by Jamie Hill. British metal label Anticulture Records released the album in the UK and Europe in February 2006.

In 2008, ArnoCorps was voted \"Best San Francisco (local) Rock Band\" by the readers of SF Weekly.

The band, who first became active on the concert circuit in 2002, were initially tied to other like-minded UK bands of that time, most notably The Libertines, by a British music press that were looking for a 'British rearguard' to the wave of popular US alternative rock bands of the time. They had outgrown this tag by the time of the commercial success of their third LP. In 2008, Q magazine described the band as \"The biggest cult band in the UK\". In 2012, the band's 10th anniversary year, they were honoured with the Spirit of Independence award at the annual Q Awards. Several months later, they received the Outstanding Contribution to Music award at the annual NME Awards. As of 2015, their last 3 albums have charted in the UK Top 10."@en ;

The album again received mixed reviews from critics. The band's fourth and latest album, Helios, was released in February 2014. The Fray's use of the piano as the lead instrument in their music has led critics to compare the band with English piano-driven bands such as Coldplay and Keane.

In 2006, Proctor departed to return to his day job as a computer programmer full time. In 2007, The Lovemakers signed to Fuzz, a fledgling San Francisco record label, who released their third album Misery Loves Company on July 24, 2007. The album is an enhanced EP featuring 5 songs and 5 corresponding high-quality music videos. A single, \"Whine & Dine\", was put out in advance of the release date. For Misery Loves Company and the subsequent touring the band featured Brandon Arnovick on keyboards and Kenneth Hard on drums. At some point Arnovick and Hard departed, and Hard was replaced by Michael Urbano on drums. Urbano recorded drums on all except for one track on Let's Be Friends, but did not play live with the band after that time. On its tour in support of the album, the band featured Cary LaScala on drums and Gareth Lloyd on synthesizer for live performances.[dated info] In 2008, The Lovemakers began a production deal with independent music company Talking House Productions (San Francisco) and recorded its fourth album. Talking House Records released the album Let's Be Friends in September 2009 under The Lovemakers' own mark, and the band followed the release with a supporting tour. The label released an advance single called \"See What I Wanna See\" on August 11, 2009, which was featured by iTunes on its \"WHAT'S HOT\" list and its \"NEW AND NOTEWORTHY\" list. Their second single off Let's Be Friends, \"Love is Dead\", was featured as a Single of Week on iTunes during the week of September 9, 2009. In December 2009, The Lovemakers announced they would play their last show on New Year's Eve in Oakland at Ghost Town Gallery. This site is near the location of their first performance 7 years earlier. The band was scheduled to perform a one-time-only reunion show on February 14, 2014 (Valentine's Day) at The Rickshaw Stop in San Francisco. According to the band's website, the Lovemakers then reformed in July of 2014, with a plan to play hand-picked shows, and work on new material in the studio. This was followed by a single released in July 2014, \"Beautiful Master,\" co-written by Chris Stein of Blondie, produced by Jeff Saltzman, and mixed by Mikael Johnston. More shows followed, about one every two or three months, through 2015 and into 2016."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Breaking Benjamin is an American rock band from Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, founded in 1999 by lead singer and guitarist Benjamin Burnley and drummer Jeremy Hummel. The first lineup of the band also included guitarist Aaron Fink and bassist Mark Klepaski. This lineup released two albums, Saturate (2002) and We Are Not Alone (2004), before Hummel was replaced by Chad Szeliga in 2005. The band released two more studio albums, Phobia (2006) and Dear Agony (2009), before entering an extended hiatus in early 2010 due to Burnley's recurring illnesses. The release of a compilation album amid the hiatus, Shallow Bay: The Best of Breaking Benjamin (2011), unauthorized by Burnley, brought about legal trouble within the band resulting in the dismissal of Fink and Klepaski. Szeliga later announced his departure in 2013 citing creative differences. Burnley remained the sole member of the band until late 2014, when the current lineup was announced, including bassist and backing vocalist Aaron Bruch, guitarist and backing vocalist Keith Wallen, guitarist Jasen Rauch, and drummer Shaun Foist. The band afterward released Dark Before Dawn in 2015. Despite significant lineup changes, the band's musical style and lyrical content has remained consistent, with Burnley serving as the primary composer and lead vocalist since the band's inception. The band has commonly been noted for its formulaic hard rock tendencies with angst-heavy lyrics, swelling choruses, and \"crunching\" guitars. In the United States alone, the band has sold more than 7 million units and yielded two RIAA-certified platinum records, two gold records, and several certified singles, including one multi-platinum, three platinum, and three gold. The band has also produced one number one record on the Billboard 200."@en ;

The group consists of Scottish musician Shirley Manson (vocals, keyboards, guitar) and American musicians Duke Erikson (bass, guitar, keyboards), Steve Marker (guitar, keyboards), and Butch Vig (drums, percussion). All four members are involved in songwriting and production. The band have counted worldwide album sales of over 17 million units. Garbage's debut album, Garbage, was critically acclaimed and an unexpected smash, selling over 4 million copies and certified double platinum in the UK, US, and Australia while accompanied by a string of increasingly successful singles in 1995\u20131996, including \"Stupid Girl\" and \"Only Happy When It Rains\". Follow-up Version 2.0, released in 1998 after a year of production, had an equal commercial success, topping the UK Albums Chart and getting nominations for two Grammy Awards. Garbage followed this up by performing and co-producing the theme song to the nineteenth James Bond movie The World Is Not Enough. Despite critical acclaim, Garbage's 2001 third album Beautiful Garbage failed to match the commercial success achieved by its predecessors. Garbage quietly disbanded amidst the troubled production of fourth album Bleed Like Me, but ultimately regrouped to complete the album, which was released in 2005 and peaked at a career-high No. 4 in the US. The band cut short their concert tour in support of Bleed Like Me announcing an \"indefinite hiatus\", emphasizing that they had not broken up, but wished to pursue personal interests. The hiatus was briefly interrupted in 2007, as Garbage recorded new tracks for greatest hits retrospective Absolute Garbage. Garbage ultimately regrouped in 2011, and released fifth album Not Your Kind of People in 2012 via the band's own independent label, Stunvolume Records."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Madredeus ([ma\u00F0\u027E\u0268\u02C8\u00F0ew\u0283]) is a Portuguese musical ensemble. Their music combines traditional Portuguese music (which is sometimes erroneously associated with the subgenre of Fado) with influences of modern folk music. The lyrics are often melancholy, related to the sea or travelling or absence, continuing a tradition of songs dating back to Medieval times (with obvious connection to cantigas de amigo among others). Madredeus founding members were Pedro Ayres Magalh\u00E3es (classical guitar), Rodrigo Le\u00E3o (keyboard synthesizer), Francisco Ribeiro (cello), Gabriel Gomes (accordion) and Teresa Salgueiro (vocals). Magalh\u00E3es and Le\u00E3o formed the band in 1985, Ribeiro and Gomes joined in 1986. In search of a female singer, they found Teresa Salgueiro in one of Lisbon's night clubs. Teresa agreed to join and, in 1987, Madredeus recorded their first album, Os dias da Madredeus. The first album was recorded in their rehearsal space, a converted abbey in Lisbon. The recording was especially strenuous due to deafening interruptions every 5 minutes from Lisbon's tram service, which ran directly above. In honour of this unavoidable presence in their every performance, they named themselves after the surrounding neighborhood, Madre de Deus (Mother of God), shortened to the vernacular Madredeus. In 1993, Pedro Ayres Magalh\u00E3es left the band temporarily and was replaced in live concerts by Jos\u00E9 Peixoto (classical guitar). Magalh\u00E3es rejoined the group later, making it a sextet with two guitarists. They released several albums and became very popular in Portugal, but remained relatively unknown abroad. This changed in 1994 when Wim Wenders, impressed by their music, asked Madredeus to perform in his movie Lisbon Story - the soundtrack gave the band international fame. Madredeus consequently toured Europe, South America, Africa and Asia. In 1994, Rodrigo Le\u00E3o left the band to start a solo career, being replaced by Carlos Maria Trindade (keyboard synthesizer).

dbr:The_Shaky_Hands	rdf:type	dbo:Band ;
	dbo:abstract	"The Shaky Hands were a Portland, Oregon-based rock group, formed in 2003 by musician Paul Culp, of \"Lonesome Radio Heart\" and Colin Anderson. Nicholas Delffs joined soon after on vocals and guitar. They spent the next three years gradually building a following in the Portland area and self-releasing two CDs, one informally called The Skidmore Days, which is a lo-fi full-length album recorded in future guitarist Jeff Lehman's North Portland basement and mixed by Alex Arrowsmith. They also released a self-titled EP informally referred to as the Bonnie Doon EP, in reference to the location it was recorded. The Shaky Hands were signed to Holocene Music in late 2006. By this time, the lineup had changed considerably, with Mayhaw Hoons replacing Culp (who left in late 2004) on bass and the addition of second guitarist Jeff Lehman. Nathan Delffs (Nicholas' brother, and member of The Castanets) joined shortly thereafter on percussion and lap steel. Their sound is a fusion of 1960s style British Invasion bands such as The Kinks, The Who and The Zombies and American folk-rock in the vein of Neil Young. The result is what many have described as a loose, jangly, rootsy style of indie rock. The Delffs brothers (along with most of the members of Shaky Hands) also perform Shaky Hands songs (alongside original compositions) under the Death Songs moniker, a more experimental and folk-oriented side project. In March 2007, Pitchfork Media reviewed their song \"Whales Sing\" from their forthcoming debut album, out April 10 on Holocene Music. On April 5 of the same year, Holocene Music posted the video for \"Why And How Come,\" directed by Whitey McConnaughy, on YouTube.com. The band signed to UK independent label Memphis Industries in the summer of 2007, just as they began recording their second album, Lunglight. They released the eponymous debut in the UK & Continental Europe on November 26, 2007. In 2008, The Shaky Hands signed to Kill Rock Stars, which released Lunglight in conjunction with Holocene Music on September 9, 2008, two months after founding member Colin Anderson left the group. Multi-instrumentalist Nathan Delffs took Anderson's place on the drums for the rest of 2008 before Jake Morris of The Joggers took up the position on a permanent basis, beginning with their winter 2009 tour opening for The Meat Puppets. After spending much of 2009 on tour, Morris left the group in February 2010. Delffs moved to the drums in Morris' absence and recruited Portland artist Alex Arrowsmith for keyboards and guitars. After recording a new record Realms Out Of Reach in summer 2010, Mayhaw Hoons left the group and Arrowsmith moved to bass. Mike Yun was brought in on keyboards and guitar, along with Justin Power on additional percussion and backing vocals. The group disbanded in 2011 without releasing Realms Out of Reach."@en ;

The group claim these singles were made purely for themselves, for their own pleasure and enjoyment of hip-hop. WWO is part of a wider crew called ZIP sk\u0142ad, the members of which are: J\u0119dker, Sok\u00F3\u0142, Pono, Felipe, Mieron, Ja\u017Awa, Ward, Koras and Fu. WWO's first album release was called \"Masz i Pomy\u015Bl\". In that album featured 600V, W\u0142odi and Pele from Molesta, Deszczu Strugi, and the rest of ZIP Sk\u0142ad. After this album the group came into conflict with their record label \"BMG Poland\" and due to legal reasons could no continue producing under their current name. They had a choice: either give up entirely or continue under a different name. Thus is December 2001 WWO (\"W Witrynach Odbicia\") ceased to exist and the group continued under their new name \"W Wyj\u0105tkowych Okoliczno\u015Bciach\". In this group Deszczu Strugi joined the other two members, mentioned above. He has been acclaimed as arguably one of the best hip-hop DJs in Poland. He has also performed for various other Polish hip-hop groups such as Mor W.A. and TrzyHa. The first album of WWO was published by BMG. Sok\u00F3\u0142 became the co-owner of Prosto Music Label and Prosto Clothing. The new group then released their second album in October 2002 titled \"We W\u0142asnej Osobie\". Their best-known hits include \"Nie b\u00F3j si\u0119 zmiany na lepsze\", \"Sen\", \"Ka\u017Cdy ponad ka\u017Cdym\" or \"Damy rad\u0119\". Their texts are in Polish.

After they stopped to recording together as WWO, J\u0119dker dropped his solo album \"Czas na prawd\u0119\", DJ Deszczu Strugi became the owner of the famous Otrabarwa Studio in Warsaw Poland, and Sok\u00F3\u0142 recorded two albums with another ZIP Sklad member Pono, and two with lady singer Marysia Starosta."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Yellow Magic Orchestra (abbreviated as YMO) is a Japanese electronic music band consisting of principal members Haruomi Hosono (bass, keyboards, vocals), Yukihiro Takahashi (drums, lead vocals) and Ryuichi Sakamoto (keyboards, vocals). For their early studio albums and live performances, the band was often accompanied by music programmer Hideki Matsutake. Each of its members were seasoned veterans of the music industry before Hosono formed the band as a one-off exploration of computerized exotica, initially paying tribute to performers such as Les Baxter and Martin Denny while also parodying Western conceptions of the orient. Over the course of YMO's career, the group continued to embrace new technologies, fusing them with classic pop forms, and indulging in sociopolitical, technological, or musical subversion. They are often considered influential innovators in the field of popular electronic music. They contributed to the development of synthpop, ambient house, electronica, electro, contemporary J-pop, house, techno, and hip hop music. More broadly, their influence is evident across various genres of popular music, including electronic dance, ambient music, chiptune, game music, and pop music. YMO were pioneers in their use of synthesizers, samplers, sequencers, drum machines, computers, and digital recording technology in popular music, during a time when these technologies were seen as novelties. The band is considered \"ahead of their time,\" for anticipating the global trend towards drum machines and sampling, for having anticipated the \"electropop boom\" of the 1980s, their \"pro-technological viewpoint,\" their use of video game sounds and bleeps, and for experimenting heavily with computers and electronic instruments."@en ;

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Blondie_(band)>	rdf:type	dbo:Band ;
	dbo:abstract	"Blondie is an American rock band founded by singer Debbie Harry and guitarist Chris Stein. The band was a pioneer in the early American new wave and punk scenes of the mid-late 1970s. Its first two albums contained strong elements of these genres, and although successful in the United Kingdom and Australia, Blondie was regarded as an underground band in the United States until the release of Parallel Lines in 1978. Over the next three years, the band achieved several hit singles including \"Call Me\", \"Atomic\" and \"Heart of Glass\" and became noted for its eclectic mix of musical styles incorporating elements of disco, pop, rap, and reggae, while retaining a basic style as a new wave band. Blondie broke up after the release of its sixth studio album The Hunter in 1982. Debbie Harry continued to pursue a solo career with varied results after taking a few years off to care for partner Chris Stein, who was diagnosed with pemphigus, a rare autoimmune disease of the skin. The band re-formed in 1997, achieving renewed success and a number one single in the United Kingdom with \"Maria\" in 1999, exactly 20 years after their first UK No.1 single (\"Heart of Glass\"). The group toured and performed throughout the world during the following years, and was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2006. Blondie has sold 40 million records worldwide and is still active today. The band's ninth studio album, Panic of Girls, was released in 2011, and their tenth, Ghosts of Download, was released in 2014."@en ;

dbr:Blues_Traveler	rdf:type	dbo:Band ;
	dbo:abstract	"Blues Traveler is an American rock band, formed in Princeton, New Jersey in 1987. The band's music covers a variety of genres, including blues rock, psychedelic rock, folk rock, soul, and Southern rock. They are known for extensive use of segues in their live performances, and were considered a key part of the re-emerging jam band scene of the 1990s, spearheading the H.O.R.D.E. touring music festival. Currently, the group comprises singer and harmonica player John Popper, guitarist Chan Kinchla, drummer Brendan Hill, bassist Tad Kinchla and keyboardist Ben Wilson. Tad Kinchla and Ben Wilson joined the band following the death of original bassist Bobby Sheehan in 1999. While Blues Traveler is best known among fans for their improvisational live shows, the general public is most familiar with the group from their Top 40 singles \"Run-Around\" and \"Hook\". They gained mainstream popularity after their fourth studio album four, released in 1994. Sheehan's death and Popper's struggle with obesity put a damper on the group's success, and A&M dropped the band in 2002. However, the band took this transition period as an opportunity to start in new directions musically, going largely independent and releasing on smaller experimental labels. In March 2012, Blues Traveler released a double-disc compilation entitled 25 on Hip-O Records; the album commemorates the band's silver anniversary and includes their hit singles, new covers, and previously unreleased b-side material. Blues Traveler's most recent studio album Blow Up the Moon, is the twelfth studio album and was released on April 7, 2015. As part of the Blow Up the Moon album, Blues Traveler released a music video using Rockstar editor in Grand Theft Auto V on September 14, 2015. The music video\u0081 features JC Chasez and 3OH!3."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Body Count is an American heavy metal band formed in Los Angeles, California, in 1990. The group is fronted by Ice-T, who co-founded the group with lead guitarist Ernie C out of their interest in heavy metal music. Ice-T took on the role of vocalist and writing the lyrics for most of the group's songs. Lead guitarist Ernie C has been responsible for writing the group's music. Their controversial self-titled debut album was released on Sire Records in 1992. The song \"Cop Killer\" was the subject of much controversy. Although Sire Records' parent company, Warner Bros. Records, defended the single, Ice-T chose to remove the track from the album because he felt that the controversy had eclipsed the music itself. The group left Sire the following year. Since then, they have released three further albums on different labels, none of which have been received as commercially or critically well as their debut album. Three out of the band's original five members are deceased: D-Roc died from lymphoma, Beatmaster V from leukemia and Mooseman in a drive-by shooting."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Booker T. & the M.G.'s is an instrumental R&B/funk band that was influential in shaping the sound of Southern soul and Memphis soul. The original members of the group were Booker T. Jones (organ, piano), Steve Cropper (guitar), Lewie Steinberg (bass), and Al Jackson, Jr. (drums). In the 1960s, as members of the house band of Stax Records, they played on hundreds of recordings by artists such as Wilson Pickett, Otis Redding, Bill Withers, Sam & Dave, Carla Thomas, Rufus Thomas, Johnnie Taylor and Albert King. They also released instrumental records under their own name, of which the best known is the 1962 hit single \"Green Onions\". As originators of the unique Stax sound, the group was one of the most prolific, respected, and imitated of its era. By the mid-1960s, bands on both sides of the Atlantic were trying to sound like Booker T. & the M.G.'s. In 1965, Steinberg was replaced by Donald \"Duck\" Dunn, who played with the group until his death in 2012. Al Jackson, Jr. was murdered in 1975, after which Dunn, Cropper and Jones reunited on numerous occasions using various drummers, including Willie Hall, Anton Fig, Steve Jordan and Steve Potts. The band was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1992, the Musicians Hall of Fame and Museum in Nashville, Tennessee, in 2008, and the Memphis Music Hall of Fame in 2012. Having two white members (Cropper and Dunn), Booker T. & the M.G.'s was one of the first racially integrated rock groups, at a time when soul music and the Memphis music scene in particular were generally considered the preserve of black culture."@en ;

The band's best-known line-up consists of lead vocalist Scott Stapp, guitarist and vocalist Mark Tremonti, bassist Brian Marshall, and drummer Scott Phillips. Creed released two studio albums, My Own Prison in 1997 and Human Clay in 1999, before Marshall left the band in 2000 with the band remaining threepiece. The band's third record, Weathered, was released in 2001 with Mark Tremonti handling bass before the band disbanded in 2004 due to increasing tension between members. Tremonti, Marshall, and Phillips went on to found Alter Bridge while Stapp followed a solo career, releasing The Great Divide in 2005. After years of speculation, Creed reunited in 2009 for a tour and new album called Full Circle, later touring again in 2012. Another album was planned, but has since been shelved, with instrumental members of the band turning their attention to Alter Bridge's new album Fortress and tour, and Scott Stapp releasing his second solo album Proof of Life both in 2013. Currently there are no plans for the band to resume in the near future. Becoming popular in the late 1990s and early 2000s, the band released three consecutive multi-platinum albums, one of which has been certified diamond. Creed has sold over 28 million records in the United States, and over 53 million albums worldwide, becoming the ninth best-selling artist of the 2000s.

The band is best known for their eclectic sampling, quirky lyrics, and their contributions to the evolution of the jazz rap and alternative hip hop subgenres.

With its playful wordplay, innovative sampling, and witty skits, the band's debut album, 3 Feet High and Rising, has been called \"a hip hop masterpiece.\" It is the band's biggest commercial success to date, with their subsequent albums selling progressively less, despite receiving high praise from critics. They were influential in the early stages of rapper/actor Mos Def's career, and are a core part of the Spitkicker collective. They are the second longest standing Native Tongues Posse group, after the Jungle Brothers.

The original line-up consisted of vocalist Ian McCulloch, guitarist Will Sergeant and bass player Les Pattinson, supplemented by a drum machine. By 1980, Pete de Freitas joined as the band's drummer. Their 1980 debut album, Crocodiles, met with critical acclaim and made the UK Top 20. Their second album, Heaven Up Here (1981), again found favour with the critics and reached number 10 in the UK Album chart. The band's cult status was followed by mainstream success in the mid-1980s, as they scored a UK Top 10 hit with \"The Cutter\", and the attendant album, Porcupine (1983), reached number 2 in the UK. Their next release, Ocean Rain (1984), continued the band's UK chart success, and has since been regarded as their landmark release, spawning the hit singles \"The Killing Moon\", \"Silver\" and \"Seven Seas\". One more studio album, Echo & the Bunnymen (1987), was released before McCulloch left the band to pursue a solo career in 1988. The following year, in 1989, de Freitas was killed in a motorcycle accident, and the band re-emerged with a new line-up. Original members Will Sergeant and Les Pattinson were joined by Noel Burke as lead singer, Damon Reece on drums and Jake Brockman on keyboards. This new incarnation of the band released Reverberation in 1990, but the disappointing critical and commercial reaction it received culminated with a complete split in 1993. After working together as Electrafixion, McCulloch and Sergeant regrouped with Pattinson in 1997 and returned as Echo & the Bunnymen with the UK Top 10 hit \"Nothing Lasts Forever\". An album of new material, Evergreen, was greeted enthusiastically by critics and the band made a successful return to the live arena. Though Pattinson left the group for a second time, McCulloch and Sergeant have continued to issue new material as Echo & the Bunnymen, including the albums What Are You Going to Do with Your Life? (1999), Flowers (2001), Siberia (2005), The Fountain (2009) and Meteorites (2014). In 2012 Ian McCulloch released his fourth solo LP, Pro Patria Mori and a live album Holy Ghosts in 2013.

Fiel a la Vega followed their debut album with four more studio albums, three of which were released independently. Despite not having the support of a multinational record label or wide publicity, after 20 years, the band is still considered by many as \"the most important rock band in the history of Puerto Rico\". In recent years, the band has seen little activity, with its members being involved in personal projects.

It made frequent personnel changes but always maintained the presence of principal songwriter Robert Pollard. Guided by Voices initially disbanded in 2004, though many of its former members remain musically involved in solo careers or other projects. Noted at first for its lo-fi aesthetic and typically Portastudio four-tracks-to-cassette production methods, Guided by Voices' music revealed influences from post-British Invasion garage rock, psychedelic rock, progressive rock, punk rock and post-punk. The band also garnered much attention for its prolific output, with a seemingly endless stream of releases. Most songs are in the two-minute range, but many are even shorter; often they end abruptly or are intertwined with odd and homemade sound effects. In 2010, the \"classic lineup\" of Guided by Voices reunited to perform at Matador Records 21st anniversary party, and subsequently undertook a national tour. After reforming, the band released six new albums. The band broke up for a second time in late 2014, but reunited once more in February 2016."@en ;

Daryl Hall is generally the lead vocalist of the pairing, and also plays a wide range of musical instruments. John Oates also plays a range of instruments, but primarily plays electric guitar and provides backing vocals as well as occasional leads. The two also write most of the songs they perform, either separately or in collaboration. They achieved their greatest fame from the late 1970s to the mid-1980s with a fusion of rock and roll and rhythm and blues, which they dubbed \"rock and soul\". Critics Stephen Thomas Erlewine and J. Scott McClintock write, \"at their best, Hall & Oates' songs were filled with strong hooks and melodies that adhered to soul traditions without being a slave to them by incorporating elements of new wave.\" While much of their reputation is due to the sustained pop-chart run in the 1980s, they continue to record and tour, and remain respected by various artists for their ability to cross stylistic boundaries. Hall and Oates have sold an estimated 40 million records which makes them the second best-selling duo of all time. The Carpenters hold the top record with 150 million records sold.[citation needed] They are best known for their six No. 1 hits on the Billboard Hot 100: \"Rich Girl\", \"Kiss on My List\", \"Private Eyes\", \"I Can't Go for That (No Can Do)\", \"Maneater\", and \"Out of Touch\", as well as many other songs which charted in the Top 40. In total, they had 34 chart hits on the US Billboard Hot 100, seven RIAA platinum albums, and six RIAA gold albums. Because of that chart success, Billboard magazine named them the most successful duo of the rock era, surpassing The Everly Brothers. In 2003, Hall and Oates were inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame. Billboard magazine had Hall & Oates at No. 15 on their list of the 100 greatest artists of all time and the No. 1 duo, while VH1 placed the duo as No. 99 on their list of the 100 greatest artists of all time. They were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in April 2014."@en ;

dbr:Helloween	rdf:type	dbo:Band ;
	dbo:abstract	"Helloween is a German power metal band founded in 1984 in Hamburg, Northern Germany. The band is a pioneering force in the power metal genre, and their second and third studio albums, Keeper of the Seven Keys: Part I and Part II, are considered masterpieces of the genre.[citation needed] Twelve musicians have been a part of the band's line-up in its history, which has consisted of singer Andi Deris, guitarists Michael Weikath and Sascha Gerstner, bass guitarist Markus Grosskopf, and drummer Daniel L\u00F6ble since 2005. Helloween was formed in 1984 by members of bands Iron Fist, Gentry, and Powerfool. Its first line-up consisted of Weikath, Grosskopf, singer and guitarist Kai Hansen, and drummer Ingo Schwichtenberg. After the release of a self-titled EP and a first album in 1985, it expanded into a quintet when singer Michael Kiske joined, with Hansen only acting as guitarist. Under this line-up, they released the Keeper of the Seven Keys albums (1987 and 1988), which established Helloween as a notable heavy metal band and led to the creation of the power metal subgenre. However, Hansen left the band quickly after the release of Part II and was replaced by Roland Grapow. He then created the band Gamma Ray. Helloween's first two albums without Hansen, Pink Bubbles Go Ape (1991) and Chameleon (1993), were commercial and critical failures, which created tensions between band members and led to the firing of Schwichtenberg and Kiske. They were replaced by Uli Kusch and Andi Deris respectively. The albums released under this line-up, consisting of Master of the Rings (1994), The Time of the Oath (1996), Better Than Raw (1998) and The Dark Ride (2000), received a warm reception from both fans and critics, gradually establishing Helloween as a successful band again. However, tensions following the release of The Dark Ride led to the dismissals of both Grapow and Kusch, who then went on to found Masterplan together. Grapow was replaced by Gerstner, but the attempts to find a new drummer were chaotic and no band member was credited for drums on the album Rabbit Don't Come Easy (2003). The band finally found a stable drummer in L\u00F6ble in 2005. Under this new and current line-up, the longest in its history, the band has released four successful studio albums: Keeper of the Seven Keys: The Legacy (2005), Gambling with the Devil (2007), 7 Sinners (2010), and Straight Out of Hell (2013), with all members except L\u00F6ble contributing to songwriting. Their fifteenth studio album, My God-Given Right, was released on 29 May 2015. Since its creation, Helloween has released fifteen studio albums, three live albums, three EPs, and twenty-seven singles, and has sold more than eight million records worldwide."@en ;

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herman\u0027s_Hermits>	rdf:type	dbo:Band ;
	dbo:abstract	"Herman's Hermits are an English beat (or pop) band, formed in Manchester in 1962. Originally called Herman & The Hermits, they were discovered by Harvey Lisberg, who signed them up to management. Lisberg sent a return plane ticket to Mickie Most so that he could come up from London to see the band play in Bolton. Most became the group's record producer, controlling the band's output. He emphasised a simple, non-threatening, clean-cut image, although the band originally played R&B numbers. This helped Herman's Hermits become hugely successful in the mid-1960s but dampened the band's songwriting; Noone, Hopwood, Leckenby and Green's songs were relegated to B-sides and album cuts. Their first hit was a cover of Earl-Jean's \"I'm into Something Good\" (written by Gerry Goffin and Carole King), which reached No. 1 in the UK Singles Chart and No. 13 in the US in late 1964. They never topped the British charts again, but had two US Billboard Hot 100 No.1s with \"Mrs. Brown, You've Got a Lovely Daughter\" (originally sung by Tom Courtenay in a 1963 British TV play) and \"I'm Henry the Eighth, I Am\" (a British music hall song by Harry Champion dating from 1911, which Peter Noone's Irish grandfather had been in the habit of singing when Noone was young). These songs were aimed at a US fan base, with Peter Noone exaggerating his Mancunian accent. In the US, their records were released on the MGM label, a company which often featured musical performers they had signed to record deals in films. The Hermits appeared in several MGM movies, including When the Boys Meet the Girls (1965) and Hold On! (1966). They also starred in the film Mrs. Brown You've Got a Lovely Daughter (1968) and appeared in the 1965 anthology film Pop Gear. Herman's Hermits had four Top 3 hits in the US in 1965, with the aforementioned No. 1 hits and \"Can't You Hear My Heartbeat\" (US No. 2). They recorded The Rays' \"Silhouettes\" (US No. 5), Sam Cooke's \"Wonderful World\" (US No. 4), \"Just a Little Bit Better\" (US No. 7), and \"A Must to Avoid\" (US No. 8) in 1965; \"Listen People\" (US No. 3), George Formby's \"Leaning on a Lamp Post\" from Me and My Girl (US No. 9), and the Ray Davies song \"Dandy\" (US No. 5) in 1966; and \"There's a Kind of Hush\" (US No. 4) in 1967. On WLS \"Mrs. Brown\" and \"Silhouettes\" were 1\u20132 on 14 May 1965 and exchanged positions the next week, a distinction matched only by The Beatles' \"I Want to Hold Your Hand\" and \"She Loves You\" during 14 February \u2013 6 March 1964. They appeared on The Ed Sullivan Show, The Dean Martin Show and The Jackie Gleason Show. Continued success in the US proved elusive beyond 1967, although they had as many Top Ten hits in Britain (five) in the period 1967 through 1970 as they had had there in the years of the mid-'sixties when the band were wowing American audiences and British audiences seemed more diffident. By the time the group recorded their final album of the 1960s, Rock 'n' Roll Party, the band's success in the US was history and the album was not released by MGM there. Peter Noone and Keith Hopwood left the band in 1971. Herman's Hermits reunited in 1973 to headline a successful British invasion tour of the US culminating with a standing-room-only performance at Madison Square Garden and an appearance on The Midnight Special (without Hopwood). Later, a version of the band featuring Leckenby and Whitwam opened for The Monkees on reunion tours of the US. Noone declined an offer from tour organizers to appear, but later appeared with Davy Jones on a successful teen-idols tour. Karl Green began performing again in 2014, playing the hits of Herman's Hermits for the first time since 1980."@en ;

dbr:Judas_Priest	rdf:type	dbo:Band ;
	dbo:abstract	"Judas Priest are a British heavy metal band formed in Birmingham, England, in 1969. The band has sold over 45 million albums to date. MTV ranked them the second greatest metal band of all time. Despite an innovative and pioneering body of work in the latter half of the 1970s, the band struggled with indifferently-produced records, repeated changes of drummer and a lack of major commercial success or attention until 1980, when they adopted a more simplified sound on the album British Steel, which helped shoot them to rock superstar status. In 1989, they were named as defendants in an unsuccessful lawsuit alleging that subliminal messages on the song Better By You, Better Than Me had caused the suicide attempts of two young men. The band's membership has seen much turnover, including a revolving cast of drummers in the 1970s, and the temporary departure of singer Rob Halford in the early 1990s. The current line-up consists of lead vocalist Rob Halford, guitarists Glenn Tipton and Richie Faulkner, bassist Ian Hill, and drummer Scott Travis. The band's best-selling album is 1982's Screaming for Vengeance with their most commercially successful line-up, featuring Halford, Tipton, Hill, K. K. Downing (guitar), and Dave Holland (drums). Their influence, while mainly Rob Halford's operatic vocal style and the twin guitar sound of K.K. Downing and Glenn Tipton, has been adopted by many bands. Their image of leather, spikes, and other taboo articles of clothing were widely influential during the glam metal era of the 1980s. Their British Steel album has been referred to as the \"record that, more than any other, codified what we mean by 'heavy metal'\". Despite a decline in exposure during the mid 1990s, the band has once again seen a resurgence, including worldwide tours, being inaugural inductees into the VH1 Rock Honors in 2005, receiving a Grammy Award for Best Metal Performance in 2010, and their songs featured in video games such as Guitar Hero and the Rock Band series."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Mercyful Fate is a Danish heavy metal band from Copenhagen, formed in 1981 by vocalist King Diamond and guitarist Hank Shermann. Influenced by progressive rock and hard rock, with lyrics dealing with Satan and the occult, Mercyful Fate were part of the first wave of black metal in the early to mid-1980s. Many of the bands from this movement went on to influence later black metal musicians in the 1990s, particularly in Norway. Since the band's inception in 1981, Mercyful Fate have released seven studio albums, two extended plays and four compilations. After several line-up changes and self-made demos, Mercyful Fate released their self-titled EP in 1982, with the line-up of King Diamond (vocals), Hank Shermann (guitar), Michael Denner (guitar), Timi Hansen (bass) and Kim Ruzz (drums).

dbr:Moby_Grape	rdf:type	dbo:Band ;
	dbo:abstract	"Moby Grape is an American rock group from the 1960s, known for having all five members contribute to singing and songwriting and that collectively merged elements of folk music, blues, country, and jazz, together with rock and psychedelic music. The group continues to perform occasionally. Moby Grape's success was significantly impeded by decades-long legal disputes with their former manager, Matthew Katz. Legal difficulties originated shortly after the group's formation, when Matthew Katz insisted that an additional provision be added to his management contract, giving him ownership of the group name. At the time, various group members were indebted to Katz, who had been paying for apartments and various living costs prior to the group releasing its first album. Despite objecting, group members signed, based in part on an impression that there would be no further financial support from Katz unless they did so. Neil Young, then of Buffalo Springfield, was in the room at the time, and kept his head down, playing his guitar, and saying nothing. According to Peter Lewis, \"I think Neil knew, even then, that was the end. We had bought into this process that we should have known better than to buy into.\" The dispute with Katz became more acute after the group members' rights to their songs, as well as their own name, were signed away in 1973, in a settlement made without their knowledge between Katz and Moby Grape's then manager (and former producer), David Rubinson. It was also a settlement made at a time when Bob Mosley and Skip Spence were generally recognized as being legally incapacitated from the effects of schizophrenia. As described by Jeff Tamarkin, \"The Grape's saga is one of squandered potential, absurdly misguided decisions, bad luck, blunders and excruciating heartbreak, all set to the tune of some of the greatest rock and roll ever to emerge from San Francisco. Moby Grape could have had it all, but they ended up with nothing, and less.\""@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"No Doubt is an American rock band from Anaheim, California, that formed in 1986. Since 1994, the group has consisted of vocalist Gwen Stefani, bassist and keyboardist Tony Kanal, guitarist and keyboardist Tom Dumont, and drummer Adrian Young. Since the mid-1990s in live performances and the studio, they have been supported by keyboardist and trombonist Gabrial McNair and keyboardist and trumpeter Stephen Bradley. The ska sound of their first album No Doubt (1992) failed to make an impact. The Beacon Street Collection (1995) is a raw expression of their sound,[citation needed] inspired by ska punk and released independently by the band under their own record label. The album sold over 100,000 copies in 1995, over three times as many as their first album sold. The band's diamond-certified album Tragic Kingdom (1995) helped launch the third-wave ska revival of the 1990s, and \"Don't Speak\", the third single from the album, set a record when it spent 16 weeks at the number one spot on the Billboard Hot 100 Airplay chart. The group's next album, Return of Saturn (2000), despite the Top 40 hit single \"Simple Kind of Life\", did not match the success of their previous but received critical praise and was nominated for Best Rock Album at the 43rd Grammy Awards. Fifteen months later, the band reappeared with Rock Steady (2001), which incorporated reggae and dancehall music into their work. The album was primarily recorded in Jamaica and featured collaborations with Jamaican artists Bounty Killer, Sly and Robbie, and Lady Saw. The album produced two Grammy-winning singles, \"Hey Baby\" and \"Underneath It All\", as well as \"Hella Good.\" On 22 November 2002, No Doubt received the Key to the City of Anaheim, given by the Mayor of Anaheim, Tom Daly in Disneyland during the band's appearance on 'Breakfast with Kevin and Bean' (KROQ-FM) where they performed five songs. After a 2004 tour the band embarked on solo projects, with Stefani releasing two successful solo albums Love. Angel. Music. Baby. (2004) and The Sweet Escape (2006) while Tom Dumont released his own solo music project, Invincible Overlord. In 2008, the band resumed working slowly on their sixth effort, titled Push and Shove (2012), and released their single \"Settle Down\". They have sold over 33 million albums worldwide."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Steppenwolf, formerly known as The Sparrow and prior to that as The Sparrows is a Canadian-American rock group that was prominent from 1968 to 1972. The group was formed in late 1965 in Toronto by bassist, singer, band leader and songwriter, Nick St. Nicholas. First musicians chosen by St. Nicholas to be the band members were drummer, Jerry Edmonton and his brother, guitarist Dennis Edmonton, A.K.A. Mars Bonfire. As Jack London left the band with no warning, St. Nicholas needed a singer and found John Kay at the Night Owl doing a $10 a night gig as a solo country blues guitarist and singer. Next came the keyboardist, Goldy McJohn, who St. Nicholas had originally placed with another group he formed prior called the Mynah Birds, featuring singers Rick James and Neil Young. The essential core of Steppenwolf is Nick St. Nicholas, Jerry Edmonton, Goldy McJohn and John Kay from The Sparrow originally Jack London & the Sparrows from Oshawa, Ontario, Canada. Michael Monarch was introduced to the band as its new guitarist by Nick St.Nicholas in 1967. Steppenwolf sold over 25 million records worldwide, releasing eight gold albums and twelve Billboard Hot 100 singles, of which six were Top 40 hits, including three Top 10 successes: \"Born to Be Wild\", \"Magic Carpet Ride\", Its Never Too late, which was the third Hit, and \"Rock Me.\" Steppenwolf enjoyed worldwide success from 1968 to 1972, however, John Kay intimidated, bullied and brow beat the stakeholder members out of the band without payment. Today, frontman John Kay is the only original member, having secured sole control of the name Steppenwolf by way of usurping the other four members' 20% ownership, nonpayment, failure to accurately credit and aggressive attacks through litigation. Suspicions have surrounded Kay and the freak accidents of Gabriel Mekler 1977, Rushton Moreve 1981 and Jerry Edmonton 1993 that led to complete ownership of all Steppenwolf assets. Kay has been behind character assassinations made against Nick St. Nicholas in order to cover up the ouster leaving several million dollars still due to St. Nicholas. During a VH1 Behind The Music interview Kay threatened to have \"Louie The Large pay St. Nicholas a visit\". More than twenty years of litigation is still unresolved."@en ;

dbr:Stratovarius	rdf:type	dbo:Band ;
	dbo:abstract	"Stratovarius is a Finnish power metal band that formed in 1984. Since their formation, they have released 16 studio albums, 4 DVD and 3 live albums. Along with German bands Helloween, Blind Guardian, and Gamma Ray, Stratovarius is considered one of the leading and most influential groups of the power metal genre. In its history, the band has gone through many chaotic lineup changes and since 1995 there are no founding members of the band that remain. Currently, the longest standing member is singer Timo Kotipelto, who joined in 1994. Stratovarius was founded as Black Water in August 1984 by singer and drummer Tuomo Lassila, guitarist Staffan Str\u00E5hlman, and bassist John Viherv\u00E4. Line-up changes soon started to occur, including Timo Tolkki replacing Str\u00E5hlman two months later and taking over singing duties as well, and the band expanding to a quintet with the arrival of keyboarist Antti Ikonen the following year. Under this line-up, the band released its first album Fright Night in 1989, with Tolkki acting as sole composer. While various changes of bassist occurred, the band released the albums Twilight Time (1992) and Dreamspace (1994). In 1994, Tolkki decided to stop acting as lead vocalist, with Timo Kotipelto joining the band. After the release of Fourth Dimension in 1995, last remaining founding member Lassila, as well as Ikonen, left the band and were respectively replaced by J\u00F6rg Michael and Jens Johansson respectively. This line-up consisting of Kotipelto, Tolkki, bassist Jari Kainulainen, Johansson and Michael, now recognized as the \"classic line-up\" of Stratovarius, became the longest line-up in its history (1995-2005). With this line-up, the band released eight albums including most of their popular works (releasing an album with the same line-up than its predecessor for the first time) until the release of a self-titled album in 2005, after which Kainulainen departed and was replaced by Lauri Porra. In 2008 guitarist, sole composer and main lyricist Timo Tolkki, being highly critical of their last album and tired of the tensions between the members, decided to disband Stratovarius. However, at the demand of the rest of the band, he agreed to let them continue as Stratovarius while leaving the band. He subsequently regreted his decision, stating that the current band had nothing to do with Stratovarius which he considered as mainly his own work. Despite the controversy of Tolkki's departure, the band's following albums Polaris (2009) and Elysium (2011), the first albums with Porra and new guitarist Matias Kupiainen in which all members except Michael were part of the songwriting process, received positive reception, with various critics and fans considering it their best albums in the last decade. After a small \"Farewell J\u00F6rg\" tour in Finland, J\u00F6rg Michael departed for personal reasons in 2012. With new drummer Rolf Pilve, the band released its fifteenth album Nemesis in 2013. Their next album, Eternal, was released in 2015."@en ;

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Suede_(band)>	rdf:type	dbo:Band ;
	dbo:abstract	"Suede are an English alternative rock band, formed in London in 1989 and currently consists of singer Brett Anderson, guitarist Richard Oakes, bass player Mat Osman, drummer Simon Gilbert and keyboardist/rhythm guitarist Neil Codling. Having split up in 2003, the Coming Up/Head Music line-up of the band reformed in 2010. The band's original guitarist Bernard Butler left the band in 1994. In 1992, Suede were described as \"The Best New Band in Britain\", and attracted much attention from the British music press. The following year their debut album Suede, went to the top of the charts by becoming the fastest-selling debut album in almost ten years. It won the Mercury Music Prize and helped foster Britpop as a musical genre. However, the band's follow-up, Dog Man Star (1994), showed Suede distancing themselves from their Britpop peers. The recording sessions for Dog Man Star were fraught with difficulty, and ended with Butler departing the band after confrontations with the rest of the band. The album was completed without Butler, with the band touring the album with new recruit Richard Oakes. Although a commercial disappointment at the time, the album was met with a generally enthusiastic reception on release and has, over time been lauded with universal acclaim from critics. In 1996, following the further recruitment of keyboard player Neil Codling along with Oakes, Suede went on to greater commercial success with Coming Up. The album reached number one in the UK, producing five top ten singles and becoming Suede's biggest-selling album worldwide. In 1997, Anderson became addicted to crack and heroin. Despite problems within the band, Suede's fourth album Head Music (1999) was a British chart-topper. The album was promoted heavily with the band receiving considerable press coverage on its release, however it garnered a mixed reaction dividing fans and critics alike. Codling left the band in 2001, citing chronic fatigue syndrome and was replaced by Alex Lee. The band's fifth album, A New Morning (2002), the first following the collapse of Nude Records, was a commercial disappointment, and the group disbanded the following year. After much speculation Suede reformed in 2010 for a series of concerts. Three years on from their reunion gigs, Suede released their sixth album, Bloodsports. It was well received by critics and returned the band to the top ten in the UK. Night Thoughts (2016) was an even greater critical and commercial success than its predecessor."@en ;

dbr:The_Electric_Prunes	rdf:type	dbo:Band ;
	dbo:abstract	"The Electric Prunes are an American psychedelic rock band, formed in Los Angeles, California, in 1965. Much of the band's music was, as music historian Richie Unterberger described it, possessed of \"an eerie and sometimes anguished ambiance\", and, early on, mainly consisted of material by songwriters Annette Tucker and Nancie Mantz, though the group also penned their own songs. Combining elements of psychedelia and electronic rock, the band's sound was marked by innovative recording techniques with fuzz-toned guitars and oscillating sound effects. In addition, guitarist Ken Williams' and singer James Lowe's concept of \"free-form garage music\" provided the band with a richer sonic palette and exploratory lyrical structure than many of their contemporaries. The band was signed to Reprise Records in 1966 and released their first single, \"Ain't It Hard\", in the latter part of the year. Their first album, The Electric Prunes, included the band's two nationally charting songs, \"I Had Too Much to Dream (Last Night)\" and \"Get Me to the World on Time\". With the appearance of their second album, Underground, the band was more free to create their own material. However, the original group disbanded by 1968 when they proved unable to record the innovative and complex arrangements by David Axelrod on the albums Mass in F Minor and Release of an Oath. Both albums were released under the band's name, the rights to which were owned by their record producer David Hassinger, but were largely performed by other musicians. Several of the original band members reconvened and recorded again after 2001."@en ;

dbr:The_Isley_Brothers	rdf:type	dbo:Band ;
	dbo:abstract	"The Isley Brothers (/\u02C8a\u026Azli\u02D0/) are an American musical group originally from Cincinnati, Ohio, originally a vocal trio consisting of brothers O'Kelly Isley, Jr., Rudolph Isley and Ronald Isley. The group has been cited as having enjoyed one of the \"longest, most influential, and most diverse careers in the pantheon of popular music\". Alongside a fourth brother, Vernon, the group originally performed gospel music until Vernon's death a few years after its original formation. After moving to the New York City area in the late 1950s, the group had modest chart successes during their early years, first coming to prominence in 1959 with their fourth single, \"Shout\", written by the three brothers. Initially a modest charted single, the song eventually sold over a million copies. Afterwards the group recorded modestly successful works for a variety of labels, including the top 20 single, \"Twist and Shout\" and the Motown single, \"This Old Heart of Mine (Is Weak for You)\" before recording and issuing the Grammy Award-winning hit, \"It's Your Thing\" on their own label, T-Neck Records. Initially influenced by gospel and doo-wop music, the group began experimenting with different musical styles incorporating elements of rock and funk music as well as pop balladry. The inclusion of younger brothers Ernie Isley (lead guitar, drums) and Marvin Isley (bass guitar), and Rudolph's brother-in-law Chris Jasper (keyboards, synthesizers) in 1973 turned the original vocal trio into a self-contained musical band. For the next full decade, the siblings recorded top-selling albums including The Heat Is On and Between the Sheets. The six-member lineup of the band splintered in 1983, with Ernie, Marvin, and Chris Jasper forming the short-lived spinoff group Isley-Jasper-Isley. Eldest member O'Kelly died in 1986 and Rudolph and Ronald released a pair of albums as a duo before Rudolph retired for life in the Christian ministry in 1989. Ronald reformed the group two years later with Ernie and Marvin in 1991; five years later in 1996, Marvin Isley left the group due to complications with diabetes. The remaining duo of Ronald and Ernie would accomplish mainstream success with the albums Eternal (2001) and Body Kiss (2003), with the former album spawning the top twenty hit, \"Contagious\". As of 2016, the Isley Brothers continue to perform under the lineup of Ronald and Ernie. Throughout their career, the Isley Brothers have had four Top 10 singles on the United States Billboard chart. Sixteen of their albums charted in the Top 40. Thirteen of those albums have been either certified gold, platinum or multi-platinum by the RIAA. The brothers have been honored by several musical institutions including being inducted to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1992. Five years later, they were inducted to Hollywood's Rockwalk and in 2003, were inducted to the Vocal Group Hall of Fame."@en ;

The original users of that name were the trio of Felipe Luciano, Gylan Kain, and David Nelson. However, it is the versions of the group led by Jalaluddin Masur Nuriddin and/or Umar Bin Hassan that have penetrated mass culture to a legendary degree. The Last Poets have been cited as one of the earliest influences on hip-hop music. Critic Jason Ankeny wrote: \"With their politically charged raps, taut rhythms, and dedication to raising African-American consciousness, the Last Poets almost single-handedly laid the groundwork for the emergence of hip-hop.\" The British music magazine NME stated, \"Serious spokesmen like Gil Scott-Heron, The Last Poets, and later Gary Byrd, paved the way for the many socially committed Black [emcees] a decade later.\""@en ;

dbr:The_Soul_Stirrers	rdf:type	dbo:Band ;
	dbo:abstract	"The Soul Stirrers are an American gospel music group, whose career spans over eighty years. The group was a pioneer in the development of the quartet style of gospel, and a major influence of soul music, doo wop, and motown sound, some of the secular music that owed much to gospel. The group was formed by Roy Crain, who had launched his first quartet, which sang in a jubilee style, in 1926 in Trinity, Texas. In the early 1930s, after Crain moved to Houston, he joined an existing group on the condition that it change its name to \"the Soul Stirrers.\" The name \"Soul Stirrers\" yields from the description of one of Roy Crain's earlier quartets as \"soul-stirring\". Among the members of that group was R. (Rebert) H. Harris, who soon became its musical leader. The Soul Stirrers formed as a Jubilee quartet, transformed their sound, influenced by many hard gospel singers such as Mahalia Jackson and Sister Rosetta Tharpe. Rebert Harris, also from Trinity, Texas, brought several changes to the Soul Stirrers that affected gospel quartet singing generally. He used a falsetto style that had its antecedents in African music, but which was new to the popular jubilee singing style of the time. He pioneered the \"swing lead\", in which two singers would share the job of leading the song, allowing virtuoso singers to increase the emotional intensity of the song as the lead passed between them without disturbing the four part harmony. That innovation led the Soul Stirrers, while still called a quartet, to acquire five members; later groups would have as many as seven but still consider themselves \"quartets\", which referred more to their style than their number. The Soul Stirrers made other important changes in those years: ad-libbing lyrics, singing in delayed time, and repeating words in the background as both a rhythmic and emotional support for the lead singers. The Soul Stirrers along with other quartet performers, dropped the \"flatfooted\" style of jubilee quartets before them and expanded their repertoire from spirituals and traditional hymns to the newer gospel compositions. The group also loosened the rigid arrangements that jubilee quartets had favored to permit individual singers within the group more space for individual development. In 1936 Alan Lomax recorded the Soul Stirrers for the Library of Congress's American music project under the Aladdin Record label. They later moved to Chicago, where they broadcast a weekly radio show (WIND) with other famous groups including Golden Gate Quartet, and The Famous Blue Jay Singers. As the gospel quartet style of singing became more popular, groups would perform in competitions called \"song battles\" to further increase the genre's popularity. As World War II began, it became more difficult for many gospel quartet groups to make a living. This resulted in some quartets supplementing their income by doing \"live performances at churches, schools and neighborhood centers,\" (Rubin). Despite the economic situation, throughout the 40's and leading into the 50's, many gospel quartet groups were able to pursue their careers successfully. The Soul Stirrer's nationwide touring gained them an even larger audience, as they delivered the emotional fervor that popular jubilee groups, such as The Golden Gate Quartet, did not. The Soul Stirrers signed with Specialty Records, where they recorded a number of tracks, including \"By and By\" and \"In that Awful Hour\". Harris, the most popular member of the group, quit in late 1950 to form a new group. He was briefly replaced on lead by Paul Foster, then by Sam Cooke. In retrospect, Sam Cooke seems like a perfect and obvious replacement for Harris, but in early 1951, much less so. Sam worked hard to emulate Harris's vocal style and Harris claims to have spent time training Sam Cooke to be his replacement which is debated by several sources; nevertheless, under Cooke, The Soul Stirrers underwent a change of image. Cooke was young and had a more sexual presence onstage and was, \"the first singer to bring a younger crowd as well as the older shouting saints,\" (Heilbut). One of the early singles with Cooke was \"Jesus Gave Me Water\", a major hit that brought the Soul Stirrers massive acclaim. Thomas L. Breuster was replaced by Bob King and, briefly, Julius Cheeks. When Cooke left in 1957 to pursue a career in pop music, the Soul Stirrers' preeminence in gospel was essentially over, though a brief period of success with Johnnie Taylor (an effective mimic of Cooke) sustained the group for a time. Various line-ups continued touring and recording throughout the last half of the century to a small and devoted following. The group \u2014 and all of its members \u2014 was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1989 as one of rock's Early Influences, and into the Vocal Group Hall of Fame in 2000."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"The Specials, also known as The Special AKA, are an English 2 Tone and ska revival band formed in 1977 in Coventry. Their music combines a \"danceable ska and rocksteady beat with punk's energy and attitude\", and had a \"more focused and informed political and social stance\" than other ska groups. The band wore mod-style \"1960s period rude boy outfits (pork pie hats, tonic and mohair suits and loafers)\". In 1980, the song \"Too Much Too Young\", the lead track on their The Special AKA Live! EP, reached No. 1 in the UK. In 1981, the unemployment-themed single \"Ghost Town\" also hit No. 1 in the UK Singles Chart. After seven consecutive UK Top 10 singles between 1979 and 1981, three members of the group abruptly left to form Fun Boy Three. Continuing on as \"The Special AKA\" (a name they used frequently on earlier Specials releases), a substantially revised Specials line-up issued new material through 1984, including the top 10 UK hit single \"Free Nelson Mandela\". Afterwards, founder and songwriter Jerry Dammers dissolved the band and pursued political activism. The group reformed in 1993, and have continued to perform and record with varying line-ups (but without Dammers)."@en ;

dbr:Thin_Lizzy	rdf:type	dbo:Band ;
	dbo:abstract	"Thin Lizzy are an Irish rock band formed in Dublin in 1969. Two of the founding members, drummer Brian Downey and bass guitarist and vocalist Phil Lynott, met while still in school. Lynott assumed the role of frontman and led them throughout their recording career of twelve studio albums. Thin Lizzy's most successful songs, \"Whiskey in the Jar\", \"Jailbreak\" and \"The Boys Are Back in Town\", were all major international hits which are still played regularly on hard rock and classic rock radio stations. After Lynott's death in 1986, various incarnations of the band have emerged over the years based initially around guitarists Scott Gorham and John Sykes, though Sykes left the band in 2009. Gorham later continued with a new line-up including Downey. Lynott, Thin Lizzy's de facto leader, was composer or co-composer of almost all of the band's songs, and the first black Irishman to achieve commercial success in the field of rock music. Thin Lizzy boasted some of the most critically acclaimed guitarists throughout their history, with Downey and Lynott as the rhythm section, on the drums and bass guitar. As well as being multiracial, the band drew their members not only from both sides of the Irish border but also from both the Catholic and Protestant communities during The Troubles. Their music reflects a wide range of influences, including blues, soul music, psychedelic rock, and traditional Irish folk music, but is generally classified as hard rock or sometimes heavy metal. Rolling Stone magazine describes the band as distinctly hard rock, \"far apart from the braying mid-70s metal pack\". AllMusic critic John Dougan has written that \"As the band's creative force, Lynott was a more insightful and intelligent writer than many of his ilk, preferring slice-of-life working-class dramas of love and hate influenced by Bob Dylan, Van Morrison, Bruce Springsteen, and virtually all of the Irish literary tradition.\" Van Morrison, Jeff Beck and Jimi Hendrix were major influences during the early days of the band, and later influences included the pioneering twin lead guitars found in Wishbone Ash and American artists Little Feat and Bob Seger. In 2012, Gorham and Downey decided against recording new material as Thin Lizzy so a new band, Black Star Riders, was formed to tour and produce new releases such as the All Hell Breaks Loose album. Thin Lizzy plan to reunite for occasional concerts."@en ;

Formed in 1969, War was a musical crossover band which fused elements of rock, funk, jazz, Latin, rhythm and blues, and reggae. The band also transcended racial and cultural barriers with a multi-ethnic line-up. War was also subject to many line-up changes over the course of its formation, leaving member Leroy \"Lonnie\" Jordan as the only original member in the current line-up; four other members created a new group called the Lowrider Band. Although War's lyrics are often socio-political in nature, their music usually had a laid-back, California funk vibe. A particular feature of War's sound is the use of harmonica and saxophone playing melody lines in unison, sounding like a single instrument, for example in the melody of \"Low Rider\". The music has been sampled and recorded by many singers and groups, ranging from R&B/pop singers such as Janet Jackson to nu metal band Korn and hip hop groups like TLC and A$AP Mob."@en ;

Their popular records included Wishbone Ash (1970), Pilgrimage (1971), Argus (1972), There's the Rub (1974), and New England (1976). They were one of the first bands to use twin lead guitars. Wishbone Ash are considered to be one of the major innovators of the harmony twin lead guitar format. Their contributions helped Andy Powell and Ted Turner to be voted \"Two of the Ten Most Important Guitarists in Rock History\" (Traffic magazine 1989), and to appear in the \"Top 20 Guitarists of All Time\" (Rolling Stone). Melody Maker (1972) described Powell and Turner as \"the most interesting two guitar team since the days when Beck and Page graced The Yardbirds\". Formed in Torquay, Devon, in 1969, out of the ashes of trio The Empty Vessels (originally known as The Torinoes, later briefly being renamed Tanglewood in 1969), which had been formed by Wishbone Ash's founding member Martin Turner (bass & vocals) in 1963 and complemented by Steve Upton (drums and percussion) in 1966. The original Wishbone Ash line-up was completed by guitarists/vocalists Andy Powell and Ted Turner. In 1974, Ted Turner left the band, and was replaced by Laurie Wisefield. The band continued on with strong critical and commercial success until 1980. After revolving line-ups featuring former members from King Crimson - John Wetton, Trapeze, and Uriah Heep, Wisefield left in 1985. In 1987, however, the original line-up reunited for several albums \u2013 Nouveau Calls, Here to Hear and Strange Affair \u2013 until 1990, when Upton quit the band. After Martin Turner was replaced in 1991, the band recorded The Ash Live in Chicago, before Ted Turner left in 1993."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"+44 (read as Plus Forty Four) is an American rock supergroup formed in Los Angeles, California in 2005. The group consisted of vocalist and bassist Mark Hoppus and drummer Travis Barker of Blink-182, lead guitarist Shane Gallagher of The Nervous Return and rhythm guitarist Craig Fairbaugh of Mercy Killers. Hoppus and Barker created +44 shortly after the 2005 breakup of Blink-182, and the band's name refers to the international dialing code of the United Kingdom, the country where the duo first discussed the project. Early recordings were largely electronic in nature, and featured vocals by Carol Heller, formerly of the all-girl punk quartet Get the Girl. The band's sound gradually took on a heavier tone as Hoppus and Barker purchased a studio in which to record. Although hotly anticipated by music press, the band's debut, When Your Heart Stops Beating (2006), undersold commercial expectations and received mixed reviews from critics. The group toured worldwide throughout 2006 and 2007, including a summer slot on the Honda Civic Tour alongside Fall Out Boy. Hoppus later began preparing material for a solo album and put plans for a second +44 album on hold in 2008, and the group entered an extended hiatus with the reunion of Blink-182 in 2009. On the subject of the band's future, Hoppus has commented, \"I don't consider it done. We'll never say never with anything.\""@en ;

dbr:Bloodbound	rdf:type	dbo:Band ;
	dbo:abstract	"Bloodbound is a Swedish power metal band formed in 2004. They released their first album, Nosferatu, in 2005 and their second, Book of the Dead, in May 2007. The brainchild of former Street Talk members Fredrik Bergh and Tomas Olsson, the band has also included Michael Bormann (Jaded Heart), Urban breed (Tad Morose) and Pelle \u00C5kerlind (Morgana Lefay). Their debut album Nosferatu featured former Tad Morose singer Urban breed on vocals. Released on 16 December 2005 (in Japan; European release date 24 February 2006), Nosferatu features artwork by Mark Wilkinson (Iron Maiden, Judas Priest, Marillion) and received an early rave review from the Swedish rock magazine Power Play. Based solely on the strength of their debut album, the band opened for Evergrey and headlined day one of the Gothenburg Metal Festival. After Urban breed announced his departure from Bloodbound in fall 2006, former Tad Morose singer Kristian Andr\u00E8n briefly joined the band for some live dates. In March 2007, they announced their new singer, German Michael Bormann, who laid down vocals on the band's second album Book of the Dead. Bormann, however, played no live shows with Bloodbound: for their first performance after releasing Book of the Dead (9 June 2007 at Sweden Rock Festival), Urban breed handled the vocal duties. Urban also performed with the band at subsequent shows, including Bolln\u00E4s Festivalen, 21 July 2007. Bloodbound played two sets, both backed up by a symphony orchestra. For the second set they backed Paul Di'Anno of Iron Maiden fame. In October 2007, they announced that original singer Urban breed had officially re-joined and would sing during the band's tour in support of HammerFall. On 13 April 2010, breed announced on his forum that Bloodbound had decided to continue with another singer, ending his second tenure with the band. Despite the band's apparent black metal image (the band members have worn make-up in the \"corpse paint\" style in the promotional photos on their albums and Web site, and during some live shows), Bloodbound's music does not fit into the black metal category. Instead, it is more similar in style to power metal bands such as Helloween and Iron Maiden, although the lyrics sometimes approach darker subjects. In 2009 the band signed a worldwide deal with the label Blistering Records for their third album release, titled Tabula Rasa. The album was set for release on 26 April 2009."@en ;

They wrote, produced, recorded, and distributed all of their music under the leadership of songwriter and producer Jeff Rosenstock. Rosenstock and several other contributors were previously members of The Arrogant Sons of Bitches. As that band was breaking up, Rosenstock recorded the first BtMI! song, \"Sweet Home Cananada,\" using his PowerBook's built-in microphone. \"I wrote that song and put it out to see if anybody wanted it. That was how it started, people showed interest and I like recording stuff.\" The band was known for their DIY punk ethic, embodied in actions such as distributing six albums worth of their own material for free on their website, and offering free stencils and paint for fans to create their own T-shirts. They also made it a point to play all-ages shows with ticket prices of $10 or less, and offered fans a chance to perform on stage if they learned a song and brought an instrument to the show. This sparked comparisons such as \"the Fugazi for the internet age of punk.\" Over time, the band's lineup shifted from \"pretty much a free-for-all\" to a fairly steady five-member lineup. In 2012, the band announced an indefinite hiatus, stating that their summer US tour would likely be their last because \"the 9 - 10 months of our lives when we are not playing music are not fantastic.\" They added, \"We are beautiful complicated fucking snowflakes that blow wherever the wind takes us and you better fucking respect that shit, maaaan.\" Following an international farewell tour in 2013, the band played their final show in Brooklyn on January 19, 2014. BTMI recordings have been featured on television shows such as Weeds and The Office."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Mission: Minnesota Youth Symphonies (MYS) enriches and inspires talented K-12 orchestral musicians by providing professional, comprehensive educational experiences, and thrills audiences with outstanding performances of orchestral repertoire. MYS cultivates leadership in students by fostering commitment and role modeling, demanding excellence, and encouraging achievement. MYS broadens cultural horizons, develops a sense of community, and cultivates a life-long love of classical music in audiences comprised of students, families and concertgoers. Minnesota Youth Symphonies, commonly referred to as MYS, was founded in 1972 by Ralph Winkler. The program has four orchestras composed of elementary through high school aged musicians. Participation is based on an audition in which the prospective student must perform an appropriate solo, orchestral excerpt, scales and arpeggios, and sightread. MYS places each student into an orchestra based entirely on his or her skill level, rather than age. Students rehearse on Saturdays at Highland Park Middle School in St. Paul MN. In addition to the four orchestras, MYS has weekly music education classes led by Terry Burk that include Solf\u00E9ge, Composition, Theory, and Music History. Symphony Orchestra: Conducted by Manny Laureano (collegiate level) Literature includes works with artistic challenges for the collegiate-level player. Sectionals explore, in-depth, the interpretive and more complex aspects of orchestral music. Students in this orchestra also spend time sight-reading orchestral literature at each rehearsal. Compositions are commissioned and premiered. The annual Symphony Solo Competition, open only to students in this orchestra, features the winning soloist in concert with the Symphony Orchestra. String seating is rotated each trimester. Brass, woodwind and percussion usually rotate from piece to piece. Repertory Orchestra: Conducted by Claudette Laureano (advanced level) This full orchestra is for the advanced player. A broad mix of unedited literature challenges students as they refine advanced playing techniques in sectionals and full rehearsal. Sight-reading sessions are also included in this orchestra. String seating is rotated each trimester. Brass, woodwind and percussion seating usually rotate from piece to piece. Philharmonic Orchestra: Conducted by Jim Bartsch (advanced intermediate level) This full orchestra includes all instruments. Literature is a combination of arranged and unedited works designed to expose students to a diverse selection of orchestral music. Rehearsal include separate sectionals for strings, brass, woodwinds and percussion to work out problems specific to their instrument and explore the musical nuances that enhance the overall orchestration. String seating is rotated each trimester; brass, woodwind and percussion rotate from piece to piece. String Orchestra: Conducted by Patricia Kelly (intermediate level) The String Orchestra provides intermediate string players with a comprehensive ensemble experience. The Saturday String rehearsal includes theory and ear-training lessons. Literature is selected to broaden repertoire and learn more advanced techniques of following a conductor. Specific bowing techniques, such as spiccato, martel\u00E9, hooked bowings and legato, are included. Orchestral intonation is also covered. Students learn to work through difficult passages specific to their instrument. MYS has been under the artistic direction of Manny Laureano, Principal Trumpet of the Minnesota Orchestra, and his wife, Claudette Laureano, Director of the Breck School's String Program, since 1988. Previous music/artistic directors have included Ralph Winkler, Ed Forner (former Assistant Conductor with the St. Paul Chamber Orchestra and Professor of Music at Macalester College), William McGlaughlin, Dr. Clyn D. Barrus and David Tuburgen. Under Winkler and Forner's initial leadership, MYS grew from a single orchestra to 3 ensembles ranging from beginning students to college-level musicians. Under the Laureanos' leadership, MYS became known nationally as one of the nation's leading youth symphony organizations, adding a summer program and community outreach programs serving over 600 students. Several alumni of the Minnesota Youth Symphonies program hold positions with professional orchestras such as the Cleveland Orchestra, Minnesota Orchestra, the Dallas Symphony Orchestra, the Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra and the St. Paul Chamber Orchestra. In 1972 the St. Paul Chamber Orchestra Society ended its sponsorship of the St. Paul Youth Orchestra. Many of the youth orchestra musicians and their parents were determined to continue the program. They persuaded its music director, Ralph Winkler, to establish a new youth orchestra, the Minnesota Youth Symphony. MYS was established as a place for serious young musicians to learn and be challenged. The students\u2019 hard work earned them an invitation in 1973 to perform in Romania, making MYS the first American youth orchestra to tour in a communist country. In 1992, the MYS Symphony Orchestra became the first orchestra to ever perform in the Super Bowl\u2019s half-time show when Super Bowl XXVI was played at the Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome in Minneapolis. MYS worked with one of the most distinguished film composers of the 20th century when Elmer Bernstein guest-conducted \u201CThe Magnificent Seven\u201D with the MYS Philharmonic Orchestra in 1997. MYS has collaborated with many noted guest artists, conductors and performing groups including Minnesota Orchestra Music Director Osmo Vanska, Butch Thompson, Charles Lazarus, Jorja Fleezanis, Doc Severinsen, Nachito Herrera, The Minnesota Chorale, Bel Canto Chorus, St. Paul City Ballet, Minnesota Boys Choir, and the T.C. Swing Dancers, among many others. The 2007-2008 season was particularly notable, as it marked the 35th Anniversary of MYS as well as the 20th Anniversary of Co-Artistic Directors Claudette and Manny Laureano. In honor of these events, each of the Minnesota Youth Symphonies\u2019 four orchestras premiered original works by Minnesotan composers. Full orchestral pieces were commissioned from composers Stephen Paulus, Shelley Hanson and MYS alumnus Edward (Teddy) Niedermaier. To select the fourth work, MYS held a composition competition open to MYS students and alumni under the age of 21. Aaron Hirsch, of Sleepy Eye, Minnesota won this contest with his composition for string orchestra. Since then, MYS has celebrated more than 40 years in existence, as well as the Laureanos continuing in artistic leadership. MYS has continued to collaborate with various artists and organizations from the Twin Cities and beyond. MYS in 2015 was invited to take part in the opening concerts at the newly renovated Ordway Concert Hall. During the renovation of Orchestra Hall for roughly two years, MYS has performed in various venues around the Twin Cities. The four orchestras continue to excel in artistic excellence season after season, and the MYS organization continues to expand in opportunities for youth to grow artistically and to be exposed to the best orchestral music education possible."@en ;

They are inspired by rock 'n roll, country blues, old time music, carnival music, swamp rock, and other obscure Southern music genres. The band originally had a traditional rockabilly sound, but later began to rely more on its rock 'n roll and \"southern gothic\" influences. Founding member J.D. Wilkes is the band's vocalist and also plays the harmonica. Musical maverick Joe Buck joined the band in the early 21st Century and played all the upright bass, guitars, and drums on the group's first wide release release, Cockadoodledon't (2003). Wilkes is noted for his theatric stage performances, which have been compared to those of Iggy Pop, David Byrne, and Jerry Lee Lewis. Joe Buck left the band in late 2003 and began touring and recording with Hank Williams III. Brett Whitacre joined the band in 2005 and is currently the second longest tenured band member. Duane Denison of The Jesus Lizard and Tomahawk joined the band in 2008, exiting in early 2012. Atlanta garage blues guitarist Rod Hamdallah replaced Denison. Longtime bassist Mark Robertson left the band in late 2015 and was replaced by The Two Man Gentlemen Band's Fuller Condon."@en ;

dbr:Luna_Sea	rdf:type	dbo:Band ;
	dbo:abstract	"Luna Sea (stylized as LUNA SEA) is a Japanese rock band formed in Kanagawa Prefecture in 1986. Due to the use of make-up and costumes early in their career and their widespread popularity, they are considered one of the most successful and influential bands in the visual kei movement. Throughout the mid-1990s they used significantly less make-up, and after a one-year break in 1998, came back with a more mainstream alternative rock style and toned down their on-stage attire. When they disbanded in 2000, they left a big mark on the Japanese rock scene. In 2003, HMV Japan ranked Luna Sea at number 90 on their list of the 100 most important Japanese pop acts. Founded in 1986, by bassist J and rhythm guitarist Inoran while in high school, the band was originally called Lunacy. In 1989 they recruited lead guitarist Sugizo, drummer Shinya and vocalist Ryuichi, a lineup that has remained the same. They released a few demo tapes prior to renaming themselves Luna Sea in 1991 and releasing their self-titled debut album. The band achieved their breakthrough success with a sold-out tour in 1991, which helped them get a contract with MCA Victor, and with the release of their second album Image (1992), which reached number nine on the Oricon music chart. Following the critically acclaimed albums Eden (1993), Mother (1994) and Style (1996), the band switched to Universal in 1998 and released their best-selling studio album, Shine. In late 2000, after their seventh studio album Lunacy, Luna Sea disbanded. In 2007, Luna Sea reunited for a one-off reunion concert at the Tokyo Dome, and again in 2008 for the hide memorial summit. In 2010 the group officially reunited and held a world tour, and three years later they released their first new album in thirteen years, A Will."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Scissor Sisters is an American pop group formed in 2001. Forged in the \"scuzzy, gay nightlife scene of New York,\" the band took its name from the female same-sex sexual activity tribadism. Its members include Jake Shears and Ana Matronic as vocalists, Babydaddy as multi-instrumentalist, Del Marquis as lead guitar/bassist, and Randy Real as drummer (who replaced Paddy Boom). Scissor Sisters have incorporated diverse and innovative styles in their music, but tend to sway towards pop rock, glam rock, nu-disco, and electroclash. The band came to prominence following the release of their Grammy-nominated and chart-topping disco version of \"Comfortably Numb\" and subsequent debut album Scissor Sisters (2004). The album was a success, particularly in the UK where it reached number one, was the best-selling album of 2004, was later certified platinum by the BPI, and accrued them three BRIT Awards in 2005. All five of its singles reached positions within the top 20 of the UK Singles Chart while \"Filthy/Gorgeous\" scored the band their first number one on Billboard's Hot Dance Club Songs, despite the album's meager success in their native US. The album continued its success in countries around Europe, in Australia and in Canada before the release of the band's second studio album Ta-Dah (2006), their second consecutive UK number one album which produced their first UK number one single \"I Don't Feel Like Dancin'\". Their third studio album Night Work (2010) displayed a shift towards a more club-oriented sound, charting at number two on the UK Albums Chart, number one on Billboard's Top Independent Albums chart and in the top 10 of several international territories. The band released their fourth studio album Magic Hour in May 2012. Scissor Sisters have performed around the world and have become well-recognized for their controversial and transgressive live performances. They have also collaborated with a number of other well-known pop musicians, including Elton John and Kylie Minogue; these particular collaborations have been received positively by both critics and other notable figures. In 2004, Bono, lead vocalist of rock band U2, described Scissor Sisters as \"the best pop group in the world\". They have also collaborated with Global Cool in 2007 on one of their green lifestyle campaigns."@en ;

There is often alliteration in their song titles (e.g. \"Peter Practice's Practice Place\", \"Fisticuffs in Frederick Street\", \"Neville Is a Nerd\"). They are probably best known however for their sole UK hit, a punk-rock cover of \"Nellie the Elephant\". Their albums usually include a cover version of a well-known hit song, usually sped up to the usual punk rock tempo. Covers have included: \"Blue Suede Shoes\", \"Toccata in Dm\", \"No Particular Place to Go\", \"Sabre Dance\", \"Livin' La Vida Loca\", \"Lazy Sunday Afternoon\", \"I'm Gonna Be (500 Miles), She's So Modern and \"The Final Countdown\". They have also recorded parodies of popular songs, such as \"The Kids in Tyne and Wear (Kids in America)\" and \"The Devil Went Down to Scunthorpe (The Devil Went Down to Georgia)\". Their albums often start with a short intro with a catchy guitar riff, and end with an outro, which is usually a slightly longer variation of the intro riff. Kazoos are also prominent in many of their songs.

Contrary to the then-prevalent punk rock and new wave, Zabranjeno Pu\u0161enje created a distinctive garage rock sound with folk influences, often featuring innovative production and complex story-telling, sometimes even dark premonitions of war. They went on to record four albums and tour the country extensively, occasionally sparking controversy and even getting into trouble with authorities for their (usually mild and sympathetic) criticism of the socialist system, and the habit of making light of issues considered sensitive at the time. After the band's popularity reached new heights in late 1980s, spurred on by the televised version of Top Lista Nadrealista, the Bosnian War which followed saw the breakup of the band, with one offshoot continuing work in Belgrade initially as Zabranjeno Pu\u0161enje, later under the name No Smoking Orchestra, and the other initially in Zagreb then later returning to Sarajevo, using the original name. Nevertheless, many of the songs of Zabranjeno Pu\u0161enje have attained an anthemic status and their music remains popular across former Yugoslavia."@en ;

The three had previously collaborated as members of the Canadian alternative rock band Look People. Guitarists Martin Tielli and Derek Orford were originally members; the former left the band to pursue other musical interests in the early 2000s, while the latter left due to injury shortly after the release of Night Light in 2004 and never returned to the band other than as a guest performer on four tracks of The Miracle Mile. Brian MacMillan joined the group on guitar and keyboards after Night Light was released, effectively replacing Orford. MacMillan left the group to pursue his own career after the recording of Havana Winter. Mike Rathke is credited as a member of the band on guitar on that album, although he has never performed live with the group.[citation needed] Sheena Ko began performing with the band in 2010 on keyboards and vocals."@en ;

While the band's eclectic fusion of Delta blues, gypsy jazz, 1930s\u2013era swing, klezmer, and other styles makes them hard to categorize, their unique music found a niche in the late 1990s, when the band met with national recognition and commercial success, sometimes associated with the Swing Revival of the same period. They found their greatest success with the 1996 single \"Hell\", penned by Tom Maxwell. After a hiatus of several years, the original band members reunited and took to the stage again in 2007, playing select dates around the United States and Canada through 2008.

dbr:Enthroned	rdf:type	dbo:Band ;
	dbo:abstract	"Enthroned is a black metal band formed in Charleroi in 1993 by Cernunnos. He soon recruited guitarist Tsebaoth and a vocalist from grindcore/black metal band Hecate who stayed until the end of December 1993. Then bassist/vocalist Sabathan joined. The band released a 5-track demo tape in mid-1994 which brought them to the attention of several independent labels. A 7-inch split EP with Ancient Rites was then released by the underground label Afterdark Records. After the label's demise, Evil Alliance Records (a sub-label of Osmose Productions) released Enthroned's first full-length release, Prophecies of Pagan Fire. Shortly thereafter, the band enlisted second guitarist Nornagest. Eventually, Tseboath was replaced by Nebiros. In 1996, along with Ancient Rites and Bewitched, Enthroned began an extensive tour of Europe. In April 1997, as Enthroned was to begin recording Towards the Skullthrone of Satan, Cernunnos hanged himself. Enthroned recorded the album with a session drummer in honor of Cernunnos and performed at the Dragons Blaze festival with newly acquired drummer Namroth Blackthorn. In April 1998, the band toured the European continent with Dark Funeral and also released the MCD Regie Axese, which was dedicated to their former drummer Cernunnos. Later that year, they toured again with labelmates Hecate Enthroned and Usurper. At the close of 1998, the band entered Abyss Studios (Sweden) to record The Apocalypse Manifesto. The band's third album was released in May 1999 and dealt with the biblical concept of the Apocalypse as interpreted by a Norse mythological perspective. Enthroned rounded off the 20th Century on tour with Marduk and continued to tour in Europe. In 2000, the band parted ways with Nebiros and recruited Nerath Daemon as their new guitarist, went on a German mini tour followed by several other European shows and recorded Armoured Bestial Hell at Real Sound Studio (Germany). This fourth album was released in April 2001. Namroth Blackthorn was replaced by Alsvid from the French black metal band Seth. Enthroned continued to play many live gigs in and around Europe, as well as in the US. In early 2002, Enthroned signed to Napalm Records releasing their fifth full-length recording, Carnage in Worlds Beyond, later that year. In June 2003, Nguaroth (guitars) and Glaurung (drums) joined Enthroned, which played a South American tour and released their sixth album, XES Haereticum. In 2005, Enthroned released their first official live album, Black Goat Ritual, recorded during their tour of Brazil. Enthroned parted ways with longtime vocalist Sabathan, at which time Nornagest took over the vocals and Phorgath joined the band on bass. In June 2007, Enthroned recorded their seventh album Tetra Karcist, seeing the return of old drummer Alsvid for the studio sessions. Ahephahim joined as the new official drummer in June 2007 and Enthroned signed with Regain Records in January 2008. At this time, some members of the band opened a recording studio, Blackout Multimedia. In the meantime, Ahephaim and Nguaroth left the band due to lack of time and were replaced by ex-Gorgoroth drummer Garghuf. Nerath Daemon took back the position he left five years ago in Enthroned, changing his name to Neraath. Enthroned's eight album, Pentagrammaton, was released on 22 March 2010. Since then, Nornagest has given up playing guitar in live performances, due to chronic tendinitis in his wrist, and has instead become the band's frontman. Former members Lord Sabathan and Nguaroth joined the band for a one-off live performance in 2010 as an act of reconciliation. In September 2011, Enthroned announce that their collaboration with Regain Records has ended while the band was busy recording their ninth studio album."@en ;

Their first release, Grand Opening, appeared in 1994 on David Byrne's label Luaka Bop. For their 1996 release Sacred Cow, they added drummer Daren Hahn to the lineup. Also on Luaka Bop, the album spawned the hit single \"Whoever You Are\" which peaked at #16 on the Billboard Modern Rock Tracks chart (the song would also appear in a Mercedes-Benz commercial circa 2001). Gina is the name of the last track and the name of the dog on the covers of both Grand Opening and Sacred Cow. Gina's owner was Susan Rogers, the producer of Grand Opening and Sacred Cow whose credits also include Prince, The Jacksons, David Byrne, Barenaked Ladies and Edie Brickell. In 1999, the band announced a new album entitled Music Inspired by the Fragrance, and released two songs (\"Space Heater\" and \"Sweat\") on the web in mp3 format. However, in part because of Luaka Bop's move from Warner Bros. to Virgin Records, the album went unreleased until 2001, by which point it had acquired a new title: Into the Oh. Into the Oh was released on Luaka Bop / Virgin with new band members including Los Angeles session percussionist and composer \"Lavey\" Bruce Millstein. In 2006, Kurstin formed a new band, The Bird and the Bee.

	dbo:abstract	"Young Canadians (originally The K-Tels) were a Canadian punk rock band formed in Vancouver in 1978 and active for just under two years. The YC's were influenced not only by the other punk bands in town at that time such as D.O.A. and the Pointed Sticks, but also by the Dolls, the Stooges, and 1960s garage rock. Although the band only recorded two EPs and a single before breaking up, their single \"Hawaii\" is one of the classic Canadian punk anthems. Historically significant (at least to the Vancouver scene), The K-Tels were the first punk band to play the Smilin' Buddha. They also supported the Boomtown Rats on a tour across Canada. Just before the release of Hawaii, they were forced to changed their name when threatened with legal action by the K-Tel corporation. The band's leader and songwriter was Art Bergmann, who went on to become one of the key figures in Canadian alternative rock in the 1980s and 1990s. Founding member and bassist Jim Bescott died in an accident in Vancouver on August 31, 2005 at the age of 52. Their two EPs and single, plus unreleased live tracks, were re-released in 1995 on the album No Escape, with liner notes written by Buck Cherry. Joyride on the Western Front, a live album documenting a 1980 concert at Mabuhay Gardens, was released in 2001."@en ;

By 1991, both were playing all-ages shows in and around their hometown of Lunenburg, Nova Scotia and it was only a matter of time before they would plant the seed of what would eventually become one of the Maritimes' biggest cult followings. Originally founded under the Madhat moniker, they recruited a bassist (one of nearly a half-dozen who would come and go until 2005) and released the independent EP Freak in 1993. This received the attention of local radio station CKBW who would feature the trio prominently through local programming bringing Madhat to a wider audience. 1995 would bring about Hardhitters, the band's second EP followed by Full Length in 1998, the boys' first full-length effort. The critical success of the latter elevated Madhat to a national audience. In 2005, Madhat renamed themselves Air Traffic Control. They released a new self-titled album on February 12, 2005 to critical acclaim and garnering a nomination for New Group of the Year at the Nova Scotia Music Week conference. The trio's opening track, 'Feel Proud' was selected as the title song for the Electronic Arts game Rugby 2005 and has been featured in the YTV series 15 Love."@en ;

Since the early 1980s, the Austrian musician and songwriter Helmut Glavar has founded a variety of bands, ranging from punk and funk to new wave and drums-and-bass. Piers Oak-Rhind was born in England and has been a sound designer, programmer and musician since the early 1990s. He studied guitar at the London School of Guitar. According to the two members, the music mixes \"coloristic electrophonics\" with \"impressionistic orchestra-like sound\".[citation needed] The use of both eastern and western vocals, tribal-sounding instruments, and an array of synthesizers built the foundation of the Entheogenic sound. According to some people[who?], Entheogenic was one of the two major psybient projects (the other being Shpongle) whose experimentation influenced the psychedelic electronic scene. Entheogenic's first release Entheogenic is a concept album that recounts the tale of an Ayahuasca journey, with layered trance melodies and texturally rich arrangements. Three labels bid for the release:[citation needed] the former UK-based Flying Rhino, the German-based Cosmophilia and the Spanish 3D Vision. The album was released on 3D Vision Records. In 2003, their second album Spontaneous Illumination, released on c.o.r.n. recordings, was the first psy-chill album ever to make it to number 1 in the German chill-out charts. Their first two albums were noted[by whom?] for their epic thematic lengthly tunes. Both albums feature the work of sound engineer Glenn Schick (Morcheeba, Ludacris etc.) In 2005, Dialogue of the Speakers (Chillcode Records) continued the success of its predecessor, and went straight to number 1 in the German charts, where it remained for 24 weeks.[citation needed] Golden Cap (Chillcode Records) was released in 2006 and was received by their then quite large following[clarification needed] with a love-hate attitude.[citation needed]"@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"The Pink Spiders is an American rock band, formed in Nashville, Tennessee in 2003. The band consists of Matt Friction (lead vocals, guitar), Brandon Jazz (bass), and Bob Ferrari (drums). Matt Friction and Bob Ferrari recruited Jon Decious (bass) and released their first EP, The Pink Spiders Are Taking Over!, in 2004. The group toured around the Nashville area and an independent label released their debut album, Hot Pink, in 2005. The Pink Spiders performed at The Viper Room in West Hollywood on March 2, 2005, after which they were signed by Geffen Records. Their major-label debut, Teenage Graffiti was produced by Ric Ocasek and released in 2006. Promotion and the single \"Little Razorblade\" landed Teenage Graffiti on the Billboard 200. The group also made several television appearances and played at the Vans Warped Tour. The relationship between the group and Geffen faltered during the making of their album, Sweat It Out. Disagreements over money led Decious and Ferrari to leave the band. Sweat It Out was released independently in September 2008. The Pink Spiders went on hiatus in 2009 and all three members pursued other musical projects. Friction, Decious, and Ferrari eventually reunited and performed at The Viper Room in June 2010; Friction officially announced their return. The group released a two-track single and completed the \"2 Legit 2 Quit Tour\" in 2011."@en ;

The band was formed in 1979 in the state of Minas Gerais, when the members of two bands, O Ter\u00E7o and \"Bendeg\u00F3\" decided to merge. Fl\u00E1vio Venturini and Vermelho, two founding members of 14 Bis, were also members of the Clube da Esquina band. M\u00FAsica popular brasileira is a strong element in many of 14 Bis compositions. The influence of progressive rock and caipira (hillbilly) is evident in many of its compositions, such as in their use of analog keyboards and complex vocal arrangements. The group reached the peak of their success during the 1980s with notable compositions and performance of popular Brazilian songs. Due to the mild, often happy and soothing theme of many of its compositions, the band was quite popular among children."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"The Comas formed in Chapel Hill, NC, in March 1998 as a joke country band, a sort of counterweight to the hyped No Depression movement. Before long, however, both the \"joke\" and the \"country\" parts of the concept were eliminated, thus allowing the band to develop into a quirky alternative rock outfit. The Comas' respectable 1999 debut, Wave to Make Friends, was composed of sleepy (but not lethargic) indie pop and off-kilter boy-and-girl vocal harmonies, courtesy of co-founders Andrew Herod and Nicole Gehweiler. The band's instrumental canvas proved to be larger and more eclectic than that of the typical indie group, buoying the usual guitars and rhythm section with violin, organ, and creative non-rap samples. Faced with the challenge of labeling such music, the Comas' label billed deemed the sound \"stoner pop.\" The Comas issued Def Needle in Tomorrow during the fall of 2000; however, it was the 2004 release of Conductor that finally put the band on the map. Recorded after the collapsed relationship of frontman Andrew Herod and actress Michelle Williams, Conductor proved to be a fine breakup album, gathering accolades from major music magazines while also expanding the band's fan base. Riding on that success, the Comas signed with Vagrant in December 2005, and the ever-evolving band\u2014which at this point was composed of Herod, Gehweiler, keyboardist Matt Sumrow, bassist Jason Caperton, and drummer Nic Gonzales\u2014released Spells in the spring of 2007. Two years later, Herod shifted his focus to Electric Owls, a side project whose music incorporated aspects of folk and psychedelia. ~ Richie Unterberger & Andrew Leahey, Rov"@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Winters Bane are a heavy/power metal band, formed in 1990. (p486)They have gone through extensive line-up changes throughout their history with only guitarist and sometime-vocalist Lou St. Paul featuring as an ever-present. In their first incarnation with Tim \"Ripper\" Owens (who would later join Judas Priest and Iced Earth), they released the Heart of a Killer album in 1993, a concept piece based on the murderous exploits of a character called Judge Cohagen. This album was re-released in 2000 by Century Media Records as a 2-CD set, featuring a bootlegged live gig as a bonus disc. After the departure of Owens, St. Paul took over the vocal duties for both the unreleased Season of Brutality and Girth, arguably Winters Bane's heaviest work to date. Following the release of Girth, Winters Bane went into a period of semi-activity while searching for a full-time vocalist. By 2003, German Alexander Koch (ex-Spiral Tower, Powergod) was recruited and a demo was cut. Two years later St. Paul, Koch and veteran drummer Mark Cross entered the studio to record Redivivus, a full-length album released in 2006. After the release of the album, Koch and Cross were replaced by locally based Jeff Zaigen and former touring drummer Jeff Curenton and there are plans for a sequel to Heart of a Killer to be released in 2007. Former members Tim Owens and Dennis Hayes would later form their own band, Beyond Fear, and they released their debut album in 2006. The next year, Hayes would also join Owens in Iced Earth as their new bassist. As early as December 2007, it was rumored that due to Matt Barlow's reunion with Iced Earth (thus the booting of Tim Owens), Tim Owens would return to Winters Bane as its vocalist. These rumors were confirmed, as it was announced that talks of said reunion are under way. \"If the right conditions are met,\" said guitarist Lou St. Paul, \"we would put forth our best effort, making of course a 'killer' album, and do a major tour.\" The rumors also state this follow-up would be a direct sequel to Heart of a Killer."@en ;

Initially, the music of Poupp\u00E9e Fabrikk (PF) borrowed heavily from minimalistic electronic acts such as Deutsch Amerikanische Freundschaft and Nitzer Ebb, but with the addition of Jouni Olilla and Jonas Aneheim on guitar PF moved towards a more Die Krupps-style electronic/metal mix. The \"Your Pain - Our Gain\" CD was meant to be released in 1996, but due to differences in opinion between the band and the record company (Energy Rekords) it was delayed until 1999. In 1996 the band decided to take a break and PF was put on hold and the band members worked on various solo projects. In 2000 the band re-united for a gig at the Tinitus Electronic Festival and announced that they were making a comeback and returning to their roots. They released a four track mini CD entitled \"Elite Electronics\". A year later though, both Jouni and Henrik left the band to concentrate on their respective solo careers. PF disbanded shortly afterwards. After seven years of absence from the scene the band re-united in 2009, Christian R filling the place of former member Jouni Ollila. In October 2010, they once again re-united for a gig; this time at Bodyfest on Fryshuset."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Five (stylised as 5ive) are an English boy band consisting of members Sean Conlon, Ritchie Neville, and Scott Robinson. They were formed in 1997 by the same team that managed the Spice Girls before they launched their career. The group were mostly known as a five-piece, consisting of Robinson, Neville, Conlon, Abz Love and Jason \"J\" Brown. Five enjoyed remarkable success worldwide, particularly in the United Kingdom, most of Europe, and Asia. The group have currently based on BPI certifications sold a minimum of 1.6 million albums and 2 million singles in the UK alone. They split up on 27 September 2001 after selling 20 million records worldwide. Robinson, Love, Neville, and Brown briefly reformed the group without Conlon (who departed before their 2001 split) in September 2006, with a new management team headed by music manager Richard Beck. Eight months later, having secured a lucrative tour but failing to gain enough record company interest, Five made an announcement via their official website that they would again disband. In 2012, the group announced that they were planning another reunion, this time with Conlon on board. Lead singer Brown initially agreed to take part in the reunion, but later changed his mind, claiming that he no longer wanted to be in the public eye. The group continued with only four members, but decided to keep the name Five. Alongside Blue, 911, Atomic Kitten, B*Witched, Honeyz and Liberty X, Five were featured in the ITV2 documentary series The Big Reunion, which began airing on 31 January 2013. This was followed by a comeback performance at the Hammersmith Apollo on 26 February 2013 and an arena tour around the UK and Ireland in May, which was their first ever tour without Brown. In November and December 2013, Five headlined their own tour, the 5ive Greatest Hits Tour, their first solo tour as a four-piece."@en ;

dbr:Las_Chicas_del_Can	rdf:type	dbo:Band ;
	dbo:abstract	"Las Chicas Del Can was an all-female merengue group from Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic. Originally created by pianist Belkis Concepci\u00F3n, several teams of female vocalists and musicians have alternately performed under the name Las Chicas del Can throughout the group's history. Originally founded in 1982, Las Chicas del Can performed hit after hit throughout the eighties, and a great number of their singles and albums achieved gold and/or platinum status. Hits such as \"El Negro No Puede,\" \"La Media Mar\u00EDa,\" \"Suka\u00EDna,\" \"Juana la Cubana,\" \"Culeca,\" \"Ta' Pillao,\" \"Fuego,\" \"Fiebre,\" and \"Las Peque\u00F1as Cosas\" are now regarded merengue classics. Pianist Belkis Concepci\u00F3n left the group early to go solo in 1985. Singers Miriam Cruz and Eunice Betances then teamed up and got vocal support from, among others, Luchy Betances and Ver\u00F3nica Medina. Ver\u00F3nica Medina herself then went solo in 1987.In 1988 singer Heidy Bello joined Las Chicas Del Can but was replaced in 1991 by singers Arismar Eduardo and Rosana Eusebio. In 1992, the group reinvented itself under the name M\u00EDriam Cruz y Las Chicas. The first year under that name, they produced a successful album entitled Nueva Vida featuring a hitsong written by Juan Luis Guerra, \"Te Propongo.\" Later that year, \"La Loba\" was also well received by merengue fans and quickly became another hit. A European tour (1993-1994) soon followed. In 1994 Miriam Cruz y Las Chicas scored another hit with the song \"Con Agua de Sal (OTI),\" and 1995 included another successful European tour. Meanwhile, the original name was kept alive by a music industry manager who discovered a group of new and talented young ladies who would carry the torch for Las Chicas del Can and leave their own mark on merengue music. In 1993, Michell Flores, Grissel Baez and Flor\u00E1ngel del Villar teamed up to keep the legacy alive. Due to the situation not entirely clear among fans, the new girls were hailed as the \"Monumental\". They started traveling around the globe, covering the band's original repertoire with songs like \"Juana la Cubana\". This 2nd line-up of Las Chicas Del Can quickly became a successful act in their own right with hit tunes such as \"Voy Pa'll\u00E1,\" \"Hacer El Amor Con Otro,\" \"Celoso,\" \"Explosivo\" and \"Sin Compromiso.\" After the albums \"Botando Chispas\" (1994) and \"Derramando Sue\u00F1os\" (1996) lead singer Michell Flores went solo and the 2nd line-up of Las Chicas del Can disbanded in 1998. Las Chicas del Can was eventually reformed a third time in 1999, but this particular group was never able to achieve the success of earlier line-ups. To this date, the first line-up of Las Chicas Del Can (which featured M\u00EDriam Cruz, Eunice Betances and Theresa Dom\u00EDnguez) has proven to be the most successful line-up."@en ;

dbr:Major_Organ_and_the_Adding_Machine	rdf:type	dbo:Band ;
	dbo:abstract	"Major Organ and the Adding Machine is an Elephant 6 supergroup led by the elusive and possibly fictional Major Organ. The liner notes of the band's debut album, Major Organ and the Adding Machine, leave it a mystery as to who is officially featured. When performing live on the Holiday Surprise Tour, the members of the band wore paper masks to maintain their anonymity. It is believed that the main contributors are Jeff Mangum, Julian Koster, Robert Schneider, and Kevin Barnes, whose vocals are most obviously present on the album, but a number of other Elephant 6 musicians are believed to have contributed too, including members of The Olivia Tremor Control, Elf Power, and Of Montreal. In 1997, when thought to be a side-project of Jeff Mangum and Julian Koster, Major Organ and the Adding Machine contributed a cover of Louis Armstrong's What a Wonderful World to a Kindercore Records Christmas compilation. Over the next few years, they recorded a self-titled album and released it on Orange Twin Records in 2001. A trailer for a Major Organ and the Adding Machine film was shown at the 40 Watt Club on May 5, 2007 and August 11, 2007. The film was premiered on October 7, 2008 and shown at every show on the Holiday Surprise Tour in the following weeks. The film contains no dialogue and is accompanied by alternate arrangements of songs from the Major Organ and the Adding Machine album. An expanded version of the album, including a DVD of the film, was released on September 14, 2010, although some consumers received their copies before the announced release date. The films credits, as well as the commentary, seemingly confirm the suspected roster of Elephant Six musicians."@en ;

Started by Martyn Leaper in Denver, Colorado in 1996, the band's original members included Leaper on guitars and vocals, Rebecca Cole, on drums, Jeff Almond on guitar, and Marc Willhite on bass. Leaper formed the Minders in Denver along with Robert Schneider and Hilarie Sidney from The Apples in Stereo Together they recorded Paper Plane EP in Athens, Georgia. Leaper recorded the \"Come On & Hear 7\" in Denver, Colorado, allegedly one of the fastest selling Elephant 6 releases in history. At this time, Leaper began attempting to form a more permanent band after releasing \"Paper Plane\" on 7\". With a permanent lineup set, the band was able to release Rocket 58 as an EP and sign to spinART Records, who released their first album Hooray for Tuesday in 1998. Touring and the release of some other singles ensued, and the band split, with Leaper and Cole moving from Denver to Portland, OR and recruiting future Jicks bassist Joanna Bolme. The minor upheaval resulted in the eventual release of Cul-De-Sacs And Dead Ends, a compilation of singles and b-sides. Bolme left the Minders shortly after the release of the band's second proper album, Golden Street, in 2001. Almond and Willhite regrouped with the band in time to release their third album in 2002, The Future's Always Perfect. In the spring of 2008, Cole left the band.

	dbo:abstract	"Iron Savior is a German power metal band that formed in Hamburg, Germany in 1996. Following a period of several years working behind the scenes in music production, multi-instrumentalist and producer/engineer Piet Sielck joined with former Helloween bandmate Kai Hansen and then-drummer for Blind Guardian Thomen Stauch in a new project that would blend power metal with a high-concept science fiction story. The band's debut album Iron Savior introduced the story that would be told over the course of multiple albums, featuring a self-aware space vessel called the Iron Savior and its relationship to the mythical lost civilization of Atlantis. Critics have compared Iron Savior's sound and musical approach to classic heavy metal bands like Judas Priest, Iron Maiden, and Queensr\u00FFche. Kai Hansen's presence in the band brought to the Iron Savior albums on which he appeared a style heavily influenced by Gamma Ray and Helloween. Since its inception, Iron Savior has released nine studio albums, two EPs, two singles and one live album. Despite numerous lineup changes, Piet has continued to direct the band and is currently the only remaining founding member."@en ;

dbr:List_of_Iron_Maiden_band_members	rdf:type	dbo:Band ;
	dbo:abstract	"Iron Maiden are a British heavy metal band formed in 1975 by bassist Steve Harris. After several lineup changes prior to their recording career, they settled on Harris, vocalist Paul Di'Anno, guitarist Dave Murray and drummer Doug Sampson. The band released an EP as a four piece, before hiring guitarist Dennis Stratton in 1979. Doug Sampson was dismissed from the band as he was unable to cope with the touring schedule and, at the suggestion of Stratton, replaced by Clive Burr, with whom the band recorded their self-titled debut album in 1980. Later that year, Stratton was replaced by guitarist Adrian Smith, due to musical and personal differences brought about by choosing not to travel with the band when supporting Kiss on the European leg of their Unmasked Tour. During the tour supporting their second studio effort, Di'Anno was fired from the band after drug and alcohol abuse affected his live performance. Vocalist Bruce Dickinson left his previous band, Samson, to audition for Iron Maiden in September 1981 and joined shortly afterwards. After the release of their third album, The Number of the Beast, drummer Nicko McBrain replaced Burr, who left due to personal and scheduling problems on the subsequent Beast on the Road tour. This is considered by many as their quintessential lineup, with which they released a series of high-impact works. In 1990, prior to the recording of their eighth studio album, Smith was asked to leave the band due to a lack of enthusiasm, brought about by the \"stripped-down\" musical direction they were taking, which Smith considered \"a step backwards\". Janick Gers, an old friend of Dickinson's who performed on his debut solo album, became the new guitarist. This formation recorded one more album before Dickinson departed in 1993, in order to pursue his solo career further. The band listened to hundreds of tapes submitted by vocalists before asking Blaze Bayley to audition, with whom they would go on to release two studio albums, after which Bayley left the band by mutual consent in January 1999. At that point, the band were in talks with Dickinson, who, after a meeting with Steve Harris and Rod Smallwood (the group's manager) in Brighton, agreed to rejoin along with Adrian Smith, who was telephoned a few hours later. Iron Maiden thus became a six-piece band and have gone on to make five further studio releases. The current lineup is now the longest and most stable in the band's history."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Sandy & Junior was a Brazilian pop music duo consisting of siblings Sandy Leah Lima (born January 28, 1983) and her brother Durval de Lima Junior (born April 11, 1984).They first gained notoriety by being the children of Xoror\u00F3 from popular country duo Chit\u00E3ozinho & Xoror\u00F3.Sandy & Junior began by singing children's songs and country-influenced tracks (their first single, \"Maria Chiquinha\", is a classic country song). Once they reached adolescence, they changed their style to pop-influenced songs, mainly ballads and upbeat songs. They had a self-titled weekly television series between 1999 and 2002 on Rede Globo and released the movie Acquaria in 2003; Sandy also starred in the soap opera Estrela Guia (Globo) in 2001. Earlier, they had appeared in Renato Arag\u00E3o movie O Novi\u00E7o Rebelde, in 1997.On April 17, 2007 Sandy & Junior announced that an MTV Unplugged album to be recorded in May 2007 would be their final work together, through a video posted on their website addressed to their fans and in a press conference, stating also that their career as a duo would be over at the end of 2007.Both have experienced solo work: Junior moved on to being the drummer of alternative rock band Nove Mil Anjos (which also featured former Charlie Brown Jr. member Champignon on bass guitar); Sandy, on the other hand, took a couple of years off to finish her Bacherlor's Degree in Portuguese/English and marry long-time beau Lucas Lima, who not only happened to share her last name, but is also a well-known classical/pop musician, composer and head of the musical group Fam\u00EDlia Lima. In 2009, Junior took on the artistic name of Junior Lima and started a series of guest appearances on the concerts of Crossover Live, created by DJ Julio Torres and Amon Lima, (also from Fam\u00EDlia Lima and Lucas Lima's brother). The Crossover Live project plays on night clubs mixing classical music from a live violin and electronic music from a DJ. The guest appearances turned into yet another branch of the already alternative project, called Dexterz. Junior is currently touring both South and North Americas with Dexterz, and taking on occasional jobs as a music producer and/or director.In 2010, Sandy released her first solo album, \"Manuscrito\", which was produced by husband Lucas Lima and brother Junior Lima. She co-wrote every single track and is now touring the country. The album was certified platinum in Brazil and reached number four in the ABPD official albuns chart. Their 17 years of career has granted them partnerships with several national and international artists, such as Xuxa, Roberto Carlos, Milton Nascimento, Laura Pausini, Toquinho, Gilberto Gil, Ivete Sangalo, Enrique Iglesias and Andrea Bocelli, and more than 17 million albums sold around the globe, making them the ninth best selling Brazilian artists of all time."@en ;

The event was videoed by Matt Carpenter, high altitude marathoner and posted on their Myspace page. Later that night, The Bacon Brothers played a concert at the Denver Hard Rock Cafe. Also playing were Cy Curnin of The Fixx, and The White Buffalo. The Bacon Brothers toured in fall 2009 throughout the US East Coast. In 2009, Kevin and Michael teamed up with Philadelphia singer Bunny Sigler and a group of mummers from a local string band to record a special edition of their song \"New Years Day\" as a part of a fundraiser to be able to pay for the Mummers Parade in 2010 after the city could no longer fund the parade. An MP3 of the recording was sold online and people paid donations to purchase the song. In addition, they performed a one night only benefit on December 5, 2009 at the Electric Factory in Philadelphia, PA which was broadcast live. The concert included numerous performances such as The Fralinger String Band, and Bunny Sigler onstage with the band. Though many of the people in the crowd were from the Philadelphia area and had ties with the mummers, fans from various cities and states came out to support the band that night and the 2010 Mummers Parade took place. For their service, Kevin and Michael were given positions of grand marshals in the parade. On May 6 and 7, 2011, The Bacon Brothers gave two concerts for the new non-profit California Dream Week design contest and event week. The concerts were geared to help promote the event's first year launch and awarded both students and high schools focusing on sustainable design for a healthy planet. Seven students from around California were awarded scholarships for their projects in architecture and design, Transportation, and Product Compliments during an award ceremony prior to the May 7 concert."@en ;

The band is a trio consisting of Thomas Erak (guitars, vocals, keyboards), Andrew Forsman (drums, percussion) and Tim Ward (bass, screamed vocals) who was later replaced by Frank Ene following his departure from the band in late 2007. Ene would remain in the band until their initial break-up in 2010, but Ward rejoined the band in Ene's place for their reunion in 2013. The trio is known for their technical, intricate style, unorthodox song structures and energetic stage presence. Erak's alternating guitar riffs and rhythmic chord work, paired with unconventional time signatures set the band apart from other post-hardcore bands during their career. They were also known for interchanging clean vocals and harsh screams, which was often split between Erak and Ward, respectively. Over the course of their career, the group released four full-length albums, one EP, and one single. Prior to The Fall of Troy's formation, when each member was about 17 years old, all three founding members were in another group named The 30 Years War, who released two EPs."@en ;

They released an eponymous album on Hollywood Records in 2000, which, although a financial disappointment for the label, availed them a number of dedicated fans. Their songs 'Ordinary Gurl' and 'The Girl Who Wouldn't Die' were featured in the movie American Psycho 2. \"Calling All Destroyers\" was prominently featured in the animated opening titles for 'Super.' In 2004 Chuck Byler replaced Coulter and in 2005 Derrick Forget replaced Solomon. In 2005 Tsar released its second full album, Band-Girls-Money, on TVT Records. The album had been recorded nearly two years earlier with Coulter and Solomon. The titular track was included in the soundtrack for the racing games Burnout Revenge and its PSP and DS spin-off Burnout Legends. In late January 2010, the band's original lineup ( Whalen/Kern/Solomon/Coulter ) reunited. They played a show at the LA Times, & released a new song ( \"Girls Try To Be Cool\" ). In 2011, the song \"Calling All Destroyers\" from the band's debut was used as the song for the animated title sequence of the James Gunn film Super featuring Rainn Wilson, Ellen Page, Liv Tyler and Kevin Bacon. Later that year Tsar self-released \"The Drugboy Tapes,\" a collection of early demos and live performances from 1998. A split 7-inch featuring the Olsen Twins song \"Pool Party\" was released by Aderra Records in March 2012. Members of Tsar have previewed several new songs on Los Angeles internet radio station Moheak.com in 2012. The new material is scheduled for release as an E.P. in August 2012.

	dbo:abstract	"ZOEgirl is an American Christian teen pop and pop rock band formed in 1999. The group comprised Chrissy Conway-Katina, Alisa Childers and Kristin Swinford-Schweain. They were signed to Sparrow Records from 1999 to 2006 and released their debut single \"I Believe\" in 2000. This song and their self-titled debut album ZOEgirl helped them become Sparrow's fastest selling artist of all time. With All of My Heart, the lead single for Life, was the group's only No. 1 Christian contemporary hit radio (CHR) single and led to the group receiving a GMA Dove Award for New Artist of the Year in 2002. By the end of 2003, over one million albums from ZOEgirl were sold. As a response to the musical trends of the time, ZOEgirl changed their format from teen pop to pop rock with the release of \"You Get Me\" in 2003. Released as the lead single for their third album, Different Kind of Free, this was their only No. 1 Christian adult contemporary (AC) single. It also peaked at No. 2 on CHR, making it the second-highest ZOEgirl song on that chart. The group's musical change and the growing digital piracy at the time led to slower sales of ZOEgirl's music. Their highly anticipated fourth and final studio album Room to Breathe earned the No. 1 spot on Billboard's Top Heatseekers Album charts. It was ZOEgirl's least successful album in terms of US Christian radio airplay, with only \"About You\" and \"Scream\" released as singles and the latter being unsuccessful. Both songs were better received in Australia. In 2006, ZOEgirl took a seven-year hiatus, during which they would form the band COLMANblue in 2008. This new band, featuring Kelli Trontell instead of Childers, split up in January 2010. In 2011, the group reunited for a two-hour interview on The Brian Mason Show, suggesting that they may release a lullaby album in the future. On May 24, 2013, Chrissy registered the ZOEgirlMusic.com domain name with Go Daddy. The group confirmed that they have reunited to create the lullaby album."@en ;

The group is composed of Joseph Bruce and Joseph Utsler, who perform under the respective personas of the \"wicked clowns\" Violent J and Shaggy 2 Dope (originally 2 Dope). Insane Clown Posse performs a style of hardcore hip hop known as horrorcore and is known for its elaborate live performances. The duo has earned two platinum and five gold albums. According to Nielsen SoundScan, the entire catalog of the group has sold 6.5 million units in the United States and Canada as of April 2007. Originally known as JJ Boyz and Inner City Posse, the group introduced supernatural- and horror-themed lyrics as a means of distinguishing itself stylistically. The duo founded the independent record label Psychopathic Records with Alex Abbiss as manager, and produced and starred in the feature films Big Money Hustlas and Big Money Rustlas. They formed their own professional wrestling federation, Juggalo Championship Wrestling, and later collaborated with many well-known hip hop and rock musicians. The group has established a dedicated following called Juggalos numbering in the \"tens of thousands\". The songs of Insane Clown Posse center thematically on the mythology of the Dark Carnival, a metaphoric limbo in which the lives of the dead are judged by one of several entities. The Dark Carnival is elaborated through a series of stories called Joker's Cards, each of which offers a specific lesson designed to change the \"evil ways\" of listeners before \"the end consumes us all\"."@en ;

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mayhem_(band)>	rdf:type	dbo:Band ;
	dbo:abstract	"Mayhem is a Norwegian black metal band formed in 1984 in Oslo, regarded as one of the pioneers of the Norwegian black metal scene. Mayhem's career has been highly controversial, primarily due to their violent stage performances, the 1991 suicide of vocalist Per Yngve Ohlin (\"Dead\") and the 1993 murder of guitarist \u00D8ystein Aarseth (\"Euronymous\") by former member Varg Vikernes (\"Count Grishnackh\"), of Burzum. The group released a demo and an EP that were highly influential, and amassed a loyal following through sporadic and notorious live performances, attracting further attention through their ties to the string of Norwegian church burnings and the prominent incidents of violence surrounding them. They disbanded after Aarseth's murder, shortly before the release of their debut album, De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas, regarded as a classic of the black metal genre. Surviving former members Jan Axel Blomberg (\"Hellhammer\"), J\u00F8rn Stubberud (\"Necrobutcher\") and Sven Erik Kristiansen (\"Maniac\") reformed two years later with Rune Eriksen (\"Blasphemer\") replacing Aarseth. Attila Csihar and Krister Dreyer (\"Morfeus\") have since replaced Kristiansen and Eriksen, respectively. The band's music strongly influenced the black metal genre and was instrumental in moving the global black metal scene away from the prevailing trend for speed metal. Their post-Aarseth material is characterised by increased experimentation. The 2007 album, Ordo Ad Chao, received the Spellemannprisen award for best metal Album."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"The Church are an Australian psychedelic rock band formed in Sydney in 1980. Initially associated with new wave, neo-psychedelia and indie rock, their music later came to feature slower tempos and surreal soundscapes reminiscent of dream pop and post-rock. Glenn A. Baker has written that \"From the release of the 'She Never Said' single in November 1980, this unique Sydney-originated entity has purveyed a distinctive, ethereal, psychedelic-tinged sound which has alternatively found favour and disfavor in Australia\". The Los Angeles Times has described the band's music as \"dense, shimmering, exquisite guitar pop\". The founding members were Steve Kilbey on lead vocals and bass guitar, Peter Koppes and Marty Willson-Piper on guitars and Nick Ward on drums. Ward only played on their debut album and the band's drummer for the rest of the 1980s was Richard Ploog. Jay Dee Daugherty (ex-Patti Smith Group) played drums from 1990 to 1993, followed by Tim Powles (ex-The Venetians) who remains with them to the present day. Koppes left the band from 1992 to 1997 and Willson-Piper left in 2013. He was replaced by Ian Haug, formerly of Powderfinger. Kilbey, Koppes and Powles also recorded together as \"The Refo:mation\" in 1997. The Church's debut album, Of Skins and Heart (1981), delivered their first radio hit \"The Unguarded Moment\" and they were signed to major labels in Australia, Europe and the United States. However, the US label was dissatisfied with their second album and dropped the band without releasing it. This put a dent in their international success, but they returned to the charts in 1988, with the album Starfish and the US Top 40 hit \"Under the Milky Way\". Subsequent mainstream success has proved elusive, but the band retains a large international cult following and were inducted into the ARIA Hall of Fame in Sydney in 2011. The Church continue to tour and record, releasing their 24th studio album, Further/Deeper, in October 2014."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"The Pointer Sisters are an American R&B singing group from Oakland, California, that achieved mainstream success during the 1970s and 1980s. Spanning over four decades, their repertoire has included such diverse genres as pop, disco, jazz, electronic music, bebop, blues, soul, funk, dance, country and rock. The Pointer Sisters have won three Grammy Awards and received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 1994. The group had 13 US top 20 hits between 1973 and 1985. The group had its origins when sisters June and Bonnie Pointer began performing in clubs in 1969 as \"Pointers, a Pair\". The line-up grew to a trio when sister Anita Pointer joined them. They scored a record deal with Atlantic Records and released several unsuccessful singles. The trio grew to a quartet when sister Ruth joined in December 1972. They then signed with Blue Thumb Records, recorded their debut album, and began seeing more success, winning a Grammy Award in 1975 for Best Country Vocal Performance for \"Fairytale\" (1974). Bonnie left the group in 1978 to commence a solo career with only modest success. The group achieved its greatest commercial success as a trio during the 1980s consisting of the line-up of June, Ruth, and Anita, winning two more Grammys for the top 10 hits \"Jump (for My Love)\" (1984) and \"Automatic\" (1984). The group's other U.S. top 10 hits are \"Fire\" (1979), \"He's So Shy\" (1980), \"Slow Hand\" (1981), the remixed version of \"I'm So Excited\" (1984) and \"Neutron Dance\" (1985). June Pointer, who left the group in 2004, died of cancer in 2006. She was replaced by Ruth's daughter Issa Pointer. This trio had a number two hit in Belgium in 2005, covering \"Sisters Are Doin' It for Themselves\" with Belgian singer Natalia. Since 2009, the group has consisted of Anita, Ruth, Issa, and Ruth's granddaughter Sadako Pointer. While all four women remain in the group, they most often perform as a trio rotating the lineup as needed."@en ;

The band's current lineup consists of James Mercer (vocals, guitar, songwriter), Joe Plummer (drums), Jessica Dobson (guitar), Yuuki Matthews (bass), Nick Teeling (glockenspiel), and Richard Swift (keyboards). The band is based in Portland, Oregon. The band was formed by Mercer and original drummer Jesse Sandoval as a side project to Flake Music, who were active from 1992 to 1999. The band released two 7\" singles and a full-length album When You Land Here It's Time to Return on Omnibus Records and were touring with Modest Mouse when they were signed to Sub Pop Records. The band's first two records, Oh, Inverted World (2001) and Chutes Too Narrow (2003) performed well commercially and received critical acclaim. The single \"New Slang\" brought the band mainstream attention when it was featured in the 2004 film Garden State. Consequently, the band's third album, Wincing the Night Away (2007), was a major success for the group, peaking at number two on the Billboard 200 and earning a Grammy Award nomination. Following this, the Shins signed to Columbia Records and Mercer parted ways with the entire original lineup, deeming it \"an aesthetic decision\". Following a near five-year hiatus, Port of Morrow, the band's fourth studio album, was released in 2012."@en ;

Former members Matt Tong and Gordon Moakes left the band in 2013 and 2015 respectively. Their brand of music, whilst rooted in rock, retains elements of other genres such as electronica and house music. The band was formed at the 1999 Reading Festival by Okereke and Lissack. They went through a variety of names before settling on Bloc Party in 2003. Moakes joined the band after answering an advert in NME magazine, while Tong was picked via an audition. Bloc Party got their break by giving BBC Radio 1 DJ Steve Lamacq and Franz Ferdinand's lead singer, Alex Kapranos, a copy of their demo \"She's Hearing Voices\". In February 2005, the band released their debut album Silent Alarm. It was critically acclaimed and was named Indie Album of the Year at the 2006 PLUG Awards and NME Album of the year which both honour indie music. That year, the record was also certified platinum in Britain. The band built on this success in 2007 with the release of their second studio album, A Weekend in the City, which reached a peak of number two in the UK Albums Chart and number twelve in the Billboard 200. In August 2008, Bloc Party released their third studio record, Intimacy which entered the UK Albums Chart at number eight and number eighteen on the Billboard 200. The band went on a hiatus in October 2009 to focus on side projects. They reunited in September 2011, and shortly thereafter released their fourth album, Four, which entered the UK Albums Chart at number three. In 2013, Bloc Party released their third EP titled The Nextwave Sessions in August; the band then began an indefinite hiatus to continue with their respective side projects. The band's fifth studio album, Hymns, the first to involve Harris and Bartle, was released on 29 January 2016. Bloc Party have sold over 3 million albums worldwide."@en ;

dbr:Canned_Heat	rdf:type	dbo:Band ;
	dbo:abstract	"Canned Heat is an American rock band formed in Los Angeles in 1965. The group has been noted for its interpretations of blues material and for its efforts to promote interest in this type of music and its original artists. It was launched by two blues enthusiasts, Alan Wilson and Bob Hite, who took the name from Tommy Johnson's 1928 \"Canned Heat Blues\", a song about an alcoholic who had desperately turned to drinking Sterno, generically called \"canned heat\". After appearances at the Monterey and Woodstock festivals at the end of the 1960s, the band acquired worldwide fame with a lineup consisting of Bob Hite (vocals), Alan Wilson (guitar, harmonica and vocals), Henry Vestine and later Harvey Mandel (lead guitar), Larry Taylor (bass), and Adolfo de la Parra (drums). The music and attitude of Canned Heat afforded them a large following and established the band as one of the popular acts of the hippie era. Canned Heat appeared at most major musical events at the end of the 1960s, performances blues standards along with their own material and occasionally indulging in lengthy 'psychedelic' solos. Two of their songs \u2013 \"Going Up the Country\" and \"On the Road Again\" \u2013 became international hits. \"Going Up the Country\" was a remake of the Henry Thomas song \"Bull Doze Blues\", recorded in Louisville, Kentucky, in 1927. \"On the Road Again\" was a cover version of the 1953 Floyd Jones song of the same name, which is reportedly based on the Tommy Johnson song \"Big Road Blues\", recorded in 1928. Since the early 1970s, numerous personnel changes have occurred, although the current lineup includes all three surviving members of the classic lineup: de la Parra (who has remained in the band since first joining in 1967), Mandel, and Taylor. For much of the 1990s and 2000s, de la Parra was the only member from the band's 1960s lineup. He wrote a book about the band's career. Larry Taylor, whose presence in the band has not been steady, is the other surviving member from the earliest lineups. Mandel, Walter Trout and Junior Watson are among the guitarists who gained fame for playing in later editions of the band. British blues pioneer John Mayall found several musicians for his band among former members of Canned Heat."@en ;

The name Doro has also been associated with the touring band accompanying the singer, whose members have continuously changed in more than twenty years of uninterrupted activity, the most stable presences guaranteed by bassist Nick Douglas and drummer Johnny Dee. Doro started her career in garage bands in native D\u00FCsseldorf underground scene and achieved media visibility and some commercial success with Warlock in the 1980s. Warlock were starting to have an opening in the US market, when they went through many line-up changes and Pesch was left the only original member of the band. She started a solo career under the name Doro, in order to avoid legal battles between her record label PolyGram and her former manager. She released two albums in the US with producers Joey Balin and Gene Simmons, but they were not the breakthrough that she hoped. During the rise of grunge and alternative rock in the 1990s, her record label relegated her productions only to the European region, where she continued to tour extensively. She remained a successful charting artist in Germany, despite living and producing her albums in the US. When classic heavy metal found again the favour of the public, she returned to tour all over the world and her popularity as a veteran singer grew considerably, inspiring many new female metal artists. Doro is also known for her duets performed both live and in studio with other singers and musicians of the metal scene, whom she has befriended in her long career. To this date, she has released sixteen studio albums, the latest being Raise Your Fist in 2012. Doro continues her recording career and is prolific touring artist all over the world. When not on tour, she resides in New York City."@en ;

One of their trademarks is the use of custom-built instruments, predominantly made out of scrap metal and building tools, and noises, in addition to standard musical instruments. Their early albums were unremittingly harsh, with Bargeld's vocals shouted and screamed above a din of banging and scraping metal percussion. Subsequent recordings found the group's sound growing somewhat more conventional, yet still containing many unorthodox elements."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Exodus is an American thrash metal band formed in 1979 in Richmond, California. Spanning a career of 37 years, Exodus has gone through numerous lineup changes, two extended hiatuses, and the deaths of two former band members. Their current lineup consists of vocalist Steve Souza, guitarists Gary Holt and Lee Altus, bassist Jack Gibson and drummer Tom Hunting. Hunting is one of the original members, and departed from Exodus twice, in 1989 and 2004, but rejoined in 2007. Holt joined the band shortly after its formation, and is the only member of Exodus to appear on all their releases. Since its formation, Exodus has released ten studio albums, two live albums and two compilations. Along with Testament, Death Angel, Vio-Lence, Forbidden, L\u00E4\u00E4z Rockit and Metallica, whose longtime lead guitarist Kirk Hammett was an original member of Exodus, they are often credited as pioneers of the Bay Area thrash metal scene, and have sold over five million albums worldwide as of 2013. Exodus had particular success in the mid-to-late 1980s with their first three studio albums\u2015Bonded by Blood, Pleasures of the Flesh and Fabulous Disaster. The critical praise given to Fabulous Disaster garnered attention from major labels, including Capitol Records, with whom Exodus had signed in 1989. Exodus released two more studio albums (Impact Is Imminent and Force of Habit) before disbanding in 1994. After temporarily reuniting in 1997-1998, Exodus reformed once again in 2001, and since then, they have released five more studio albums, the most recent being 2014's Blood In, Blood Out."@en ;

dbr:Fall_Out_Boy	rdf:type	dbo:Band ;
	dbo:abstract	"Fall Out Boy is an American rock band formed in Wilmette, Illinois, a suburb of Chicago, in 2001. The band consists of vocalist and guitarist Patrick Stump, bassist Pete Wentz, guitarist Joe Trohman, and drummer Andy Hurley. The band originated from Chicago's hardcore punk scene, with which Wentz was heavily involved. The group was formed by Wentz and Trohman as a pop punk side project of their respective hardcore bands, and Stump joined shortly thereafter. The group went through a succession of drummers before landing Hurley and recording their debut album, Take This to Your Grave (2003). The album became an underground success and helped the band gain a dedicated fanbase through heavy touring, as well as some moderate commercial success. With Wentz as the band's lyricist and Stump as the primary composer, the band's 2005 major-label breakthrough, From Under the Cork Tree, produced two hit singles, \"Sugar, We're Goin Down\" and \"Dance, Dance,\" and went double platinum, transforming the group into superstars and making Wentz a celebrity and tabloid fixture. Fall Out Boy received a Best New Artist nomination at the 2006 Grammy Awards. Their 2007 follow-up, Infinity on High, landed at number one on the Billboard 200 with 260,000 first week sales. It produced two worldwide hit singles, \"This Ain't a Scene, It's an Arms Race\" and \"Thnks fr th Mmrs.\" Folie \u00E0 Deux, the band's fourth album, created a mixed response from fans and commercially undersold expectations. Following the release of Believers Never Die - Greatest Hits, the band took a hiatus from 2009 to 2012 to \"decompress,\" exploring various side projects. They regrouped and recorded Save Rock and Roll (2013), which gave the band their second career number one and produced the 5x platinum top 20 single \"My Songs Know What You Did in the Dark (Light Em Up).\" Their sixth studio album, American Beauty/American Psycho (2015), released worldwide on Island Records, was preceded by the 4x Platinum top 10 hit \"Centuries\" and also spawned the 2x platinum single \"Uma Thurman\" which peaked at 22 on Hot 100. The album peaked at No. 1, making it the group's third No. 1 album and their fifth consecutive top 10 album. While Fall Out Boy's music has been typically described as pop punk and pop rock, the band were generally seen in the mid-2000s at the forefront of the \"emo pop\" explosion. Take This to Your Grave has commonly been cited as an influential blueprint for pop punk music in the 2000s."@en ;

During the band's career, it has released nine full-length albums and has evolved through a succession of styles, including industrial metal, death metal, groove metal, and thrash metal. Factory was enormously influential on the heavy metal scene in the mid-to-late 1990s. Fear Factory disbanded in March 2002 following some internal disputes, but reformed later that year without founding member Dino Cazares, adding bassist Byron Stroud, and previous bassist Christian Olde Wolbers as guitarist. In April 2009, a new lineup was announced. Cazares returned as lead and rhythm guitarist, and Gene Hoglan as drummer. Bell and Stroud reprised their respective roles, and the band completed a seventh studio album titled Mechanize. Former members Christian Olde Wolbers and Raymond Herrera\u2014both of whom were playing in Arkaea\u2014disputed the legitimacy of the new lineup, and a legal battle from both parties was begun. Fear Factory released its eighth studio album, The Industrialist, in June 2012. Their latest album, Genexus, was released in August 2015. Over the years, Fear Factory has seen changes in its members, with lead vocalist Burton C. Bell being the only consistent member since 1989. The band has performed at three Ozzfests and the inaugural Gigantour. Its singles have charted on the US Mainstream Rock Top 40 and albums on the Billboard Top 40, 100, and 200.

The band released a new single and announced they were recording additional new material on November 22, 2011. The band's music is most heavily influenced by ska and punk rock, but their influences also include heavy metal. Their songs often include salsa-style shouting, sophisticated literary and music references. The band was signed to 5 Minute Walk in 1996, and stayed with the label for nine of its releases. Two other albums were self-released, and another was released through Asian Man Records. The band never received any significant music industry awards, and received relatively little attention in mainstream media. Their biggest national exposure came when their song, \"Oh, Canada\" (which referenced William Shatner), appeared on the TV series Boston Legal (in which Shatner stars) in October 2005, almost two years after their last show. For some of the earlier BriTANicK web videos their outro would be the song \"Far, Far Away\" from the album Five Iron Frenzy 2: Electric Boogaloo. Over the course of their career they sold close to one million units in total. They are known for their positive lyrics with a Christian message and energetic live shows. They often performed their concerts while wearing full costumes (mostly vocalist Reese Roper); on one tour the entire band wore Star Trek uniforms. The band was known for their themed tours, sometimes using them to raise awareness for social causes. On more than one tour they told fans to bring sock puppets on stage and help sing along. The socks, and fresh-bought socks alike, were then donated to a local homeless shelter. The band played shows at both churches and secular venues throughout their career. The band's name began as an inside joke, and the band was generally known for their humour, displayed throughout their albums and on stage. Recurring lyrical themes included the continuing injustices done to Native Americans, the evils of consumerism, Christian hypocrisy, the shortcomings of the band, and the joy of finding renewal in their Christian faith."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Fluke are an English electronic music group formed in the late 1980s by Mike Bryant, Jon Fugler and Mike Tournier with Julian Nugent as the band's manager. The band's conception was influenced by the members interest in the burgeoning acid house music scene and particularly the work of Cabaret Voltaire and Giorgio Moroder. The band are noted for their diverse range of electronic styles spanning the house, techno, ambient and blues genres; for their reclusivity, rarely giving interviews; and for lengthy timespans between albums. Many listeners know of Fluke only through the inclusion of their music in many blockbuster film soundtracks\u2014most notably The Matrix Reloaded and Sin City\u2014as well as featuring prominently on the soundtracks to Need for Speed: Underground and the Wipeout video game series. The film The Experiment uses their song \"YKK\". To date Fluke have produced five original studio albums, two \"best of\" compilations and two live albums. Throughout their career they have made several changes to their line-up with credited appearances attributed to Neil Davenport playing guitars, Robin Goodridge on drums and Hugh Bryder as a DJ. When Fluke were touring for Risotto they were joined on stage by Rachel Stewart who acted as a personification of the band's official mascot, a character from the Wipeout series named Arial Tetsuo. Stewart continued as lead female vocalist and as a dancer for all of Fluke's live performances between 1997 and 1999. After Risotto, Mike Tournier left the group to form Syntax with Jan Burton. Mike Bryant and Jon Fugler went on to produce Fluke's latest studio album without Tournier's help and the pair have subsequently engaged in projects under the name 2 Bit Pie, with their debut album 2Pie Island released on 4 September 2006. The musical activities of Mike Tournier remain unknown at present."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Franz Ferdinand are a Scottish rock band, formed in 2002 and based in Glasgow. The band is composed of Alex Kapranos (lead vocals and guitar, keyboard), Nick McCarthy (rhythm guitar, keyboards and backing vocals), Bob Hardy (bass guitar), and Paul Thomson (drums, percussion and backing vocals). The band has been known for being one of the most popular post-punk revival bands. They have been nominated for several Grammy Awards and have received two Brit Awards\u2014winning one for Best British Group, as well as one NME Award. The band began by releasing their debut extended play, Darts of Pleasure, in 2003, under Domino Records. The band gained recognition in the United Kingdom after the EP's title track peaked at number 44 on UK Singles Chart. In January 2004, the band released the song \"Take Me Out\". The song went on to achieve global recognition, charting in several countries, and earned a nomination for Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal at the 47th Annual Grammy Awards. It has since been noted as the band's signature song and has received critical acclaim from critics. The band subsequently released their eponymous debut studio album on 9 February 2004 to critical acclaim. The album won the 2004 Mercury Prize and earned a nomination for Best Alternative Album at the same Grammy award show. In the following year, the band released their second studio album, You Could Have It So Much Better, which was produced by Rich Costey. The album went on to earn critical acclaim from critics as well as a positive commercial performance, peaking within the top-ten in multiple countries. The album earned a nomination for Best Alternative Album and one of the singles released from the album, \"Do You Want To\", earned a nomination for Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal at the 48th Annual Grammy Awards. The band's third studio album, Tonight: Franz Ferdinand, was announced in late 2008 and released in January 2009. The album was notable for featuring a change in the band's musical style, as the band had shifted from a post-punk-focused sound, which was featured on their first two albums, to a more dance-oriented sound. The album gained a positive commercial performance as well as positive reviews, but not as much acclaim as their first two albums. A remix album of Tonight, titled Blood, was subsequently released in July 2009. Later that year, it was announced that the band had sold over three million albums worldwide. Four years later, the band released their fourth studio album, Right Thoughts, Right Words, Right Action. In 2015, it was announced that Franz Ferdinand and American rock band Sparks had formed the supergroup FFS. The two released the album FFS in June 2015."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Heavenly, a power metal and neo-classical metal band based in Marseille, France, was formed in 1993 in Paris by vocalist Benjamin Sotto and drummer Max Pilo, originally as a cover band under the name of Satan's Lawyer. In 1994, they changed their name to \"Heavenly\" and evolved into a full-fledged Helloween-influenced power metal outfit. In 1998, they released a three-track demo with new guitarist Anthony Parker. However, Parker's time with the band was to be short lived, leaving before a record deal with Noise Records was clinched. Heavenly then found a replacement in Chris Savourey and completed their lineup with bassist Laurent Jean. In 2000, Heavenly released their debut album Coming from the Sky. Although it was largely shunned by the media, the album proved a hit with metal fans and its success helped Heavenly land an appearance at the French Hard Rock Festival. With the arrival of a keyboardist, Fr\u00E9d\u00E9ric Leclercq, and the replacement of departed bassist Laurent Jean with Piere-Emmanuel Pelisson, Heavenly underwent another lineup change shortly before they supported Stratovarius on their 'Infinite' tour. Chris Savourey left soon afterwards, and Fr\u00E9d\u00E9ric Leclercq took on his role as the band's guitarist. Heavenly released their second album Sign of the Winner in 2001, and received positive feedback from both fans and media alike. For their following support slot on Edguy's European tour, Charley Corbiaux joined as a second guitarist, and has since become a permanent addition to Heavenly's ranks. After appearing at Wacken Open Air (the world's biggest metal festival) in 2002, Heavenly set to work recording their third album, Dust to Dust, which was eventually released in early 2004, further solidifying their status as one of France's premier power metal bands. In 2006, Heavenly released their fourth album, titled Virus. It is a departure from previous efforts, incorporating less double-bass drumming and expanding Sotto's vocal range. They opened for Scorpions during their 2007 French tour. In December 2009, they released their fifth album Carpe Diem."@en ;

To date, Idlewild have released seven full-length studio albums, with their latest, Everything Ever Written, released in February 2015. Initially, Idlewild's sound was faster and more dissonant than many of their 1990s indie rock contemporaries. However, it developed over time from an edgy and angular sound (as heard in their early material\u2014once described by the NME as \"the sound of a flight of stairs falling down a flight of stairs\") to a sweeping, melodic rock sound as displayed on The Remote Part and Warnings/Promises. While Idlewild's sound cannot be easily placed into a specific genre, they have clearly been influenced by the likes of: Gang of Four, Pavement, R.E.M., Blur and Fugazi.[citation needed] In 2010, the band entered an indefinite hiatus, but reunited in late 2013 to begin work on a new studio album."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Jane's Addiction is an American rock band from Los Angeles, California, formed in 1985. The band consists of Perry Farrell (vocals), Dave Navarro (guitar), Stephen Perkins (drums) and Chris Chaney (bass). Founded by Farrell and bass guitarist Eric Avery, following the disintegration of Farrell's previous band Psi Com, Jane's Addiction was one of the first bands from the early 1990s alternative rock movement to gain both mainstream media attention and commercial success in the United States. Jane's Addiction launched with a live self-titled debut album in 1987 and quickly caught the attention of Warner Bros. Records. The band's following first two major-label studio albums, Nothing's Shocking (1988) and Ritual de lo Habitual (1990), were released to widespread critical acclaim, and an increasing cult fanbase. As a result, Jane's Addiction became icons of what Farrell dubbed the \"Alternative Nation\". The band's initial farewell tour, in 1991, launched the first Lollapalooza, which has since become a perennial alternative rock festival. The band briefly reunited in 1997, with Flea, of the Red Hot Chili Peppers, replacing Avery on bass guitar. In 2001, a second reunion took place, with Martyn LeNoble\u2014and later Chris Chaney\u2014occupying the role of bass guitarist. In 2003, the band released its third major-label studio album, Strays, before dissolving again the following year. In 2008, the band's original line-up reunited and embarked on a world tour. Eric Avery, however, subsequently left the band in early 2010 as the group began work on new material. The band released its fourth studio album The Great Escape Artist in 2011, with Chaney returning to the band for its recording and subsequent tour."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Kiss (often styled as KISS) is an American hard rock band formed in New York City in January 1973 by Paul Stanley, Gene Simmons and the band's original manager, Lew Linet. Well known for its members' face paint and stage outfits, the group rose to prominence in the mid-to-late 1970s with their elaborate live performances\u2014which featured fire breathing, blood-spitting, smoking guitars, shooting rockets, levitating drum kits, and pyrotechnics. The band has gone through multiple lineup changes, with Stanley and Simmons the only remaining original members. Counting the 1978 solo albums, Kiss has been awarded 30 gold albums to date, the most of any American band. The band has sold more than 40 million albums in the United States, of which 25 million have been certified by the RIAA and their worldwide sales exceed 100 million records, making them one of the world's best-selling bands of all time. The original and best-known lineup consisted of Stanley (lead vocals and rhythm guitar), Simmons (vocals and bass guitar), Ace Frehley (lead guitar and vocals) and Peter Criss (drums and vocals). With their make-up and costumes, they took on the personae of comic book-style characters: The Starchild (Stanley), The Demon (Simmons), The Spaceman or Space Ace (Frehley) and The Catman (Criss). Stanley became the \"Starchild\" because of his tendency to be referred to as a \"starry-eyed lover\" and \"hopeless romantic\". The \"Demon\" make-up reflected Simmons' cynicism and dark sense of humor, as well as his affection for comic books. Frehley's \"Space Ace\" make-up was a reflection of his fondness for science fiction, technology,and his supposedly being from another planet. Criss' \"Catman\" make-up was in accordance with the belief that he had nine lives, because of his rough childhood in Brooklyn. Due to creative differences, both Criss and Frehley departed the group by 1982. The band's commercial fortunes had waned considerably by that point. Buoyed by a wave of Kiss nostalgia in the 1990s, the band announced a reunion of the original lineup in 1996. The resulting Kiss Alive/Worldwide Tour was the top-grossing act of 1996 and 1997. Criss and Frehley have both since left the band again and have been replaced by Eric Singer and Tommy Thayer, respectively. Kiss has been named in many \"Top\" lists. These include Number 10 on VH1's \"100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock\", 9th on \"The Greatest Metal Bands\" list by MTV, number one on Hit Paraders's \"Top 100 Live Bands\", 56th on VH1's \"100 Greatest Artists Of All Time\", and 26th on Gibson's \"50 Greatest American Rock Bands\". On April 10, 2014, Kiss was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame."@en ;

Malice Mizer was as famous for their music as for their live shows, featuring lavish historical costumes and stage sets, short silent theater pieces preluding various songs, and even a particularly notable instance of the vocalist descending to Earth (the stage) as a fallen angel, only to ascend again at the end of the concert. Throughout their history, the band has gone through several different lineups and three drastic image changes. On December 11, 2001, it was announced that Malice Mizer would go on an indefinite hiatus. Seven years later, K\u00F6zi played on stage with Mana's Moi dix Mois for a session gig on December 27, 2008. In 2009, K\u00F6zi went on a short two gig coupling tour with Moi dix Mois called Deep Sanctuary. A year later, in July 2010, he went on another tour with Moi dix Mois, this time with Yu~ki as a special guest at Akasaka Blitz on the 17. This was the first time in nine years that the three original members were on stage together. On November 17, 2012, the three members once again performed together, this time at Osaka Muse."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Mortification is an Australian Christian extreme metal band which was formed in 1987 as a heavy metal group, Lightforce, by mainstay Steve Rowe on bass guitar and vocals. By 1990, in the Melbourne suburb of Moorabbin, they were renamed as Mortification with the line-up of Rowe, Michael Carlisle on guitar and Jayson Sherlock on drums. Mortification has released over twenty albums and several videos on major record labels such as Nuclear Blast. As one of the earliest internationally successful Christian death metal bands from Australia, they served as an inspiration for later similar groups. During the early 1990s Mortification played death metal, thrash, and grindcore, and \"belonged to the elite of the death metal movement,\" especially with their 1992 album Scrolls of the Megilloth. After the departure of Sherlock, Mortification began experimenting with groove metal, hardcore punk and power metal. They achieved commercial success with Blood World in 1994 and received critically acclaim for 1996's EnVision EvAngelene. Despite the lack of subsequent commercial success or mainstream critical recognition, \"the band, in spite of their extreme sound, are some kind of superstars in the 'White Metal' scene\", and have been described as \"a legend in the death metal scene.\" In late 1996, Rowe was diagnosed with acute lymphatic leukaemia and took 18 months to recover. Mortification issued their tenth album, Triumph of Mercy in August 1998 and accompanied it with a tour of North America. By August 1999, the band had sold a total of a quarter of a million albums across Europe and the US. They returned to their death/thrash roots for the 2004 album, Brain Cleaner."@en ;

The line-up at this time comprised vocalist David Johansen, guitarist Johnny Thunders, bassist Arthur Kane, guitarist and pianist Sylvain Sylvain, and drummer Jerry Nolan; the latter two had replaced Rick Rivets and Billy Murcia, respectively, in 1972. On stage, they donned an androgynous wardrobe, wearing high heels, eccentric hats, and satin. Nolan described the group at the time as \"the Dead End Kids of today\". According to the Encyclopedia of Popular Music (1995), the New York Dolls predated the punk and glam metal movements, and were \"one of the most influential rock bands of the last 20 years\". They influenced rock groups such as the Sex Pistols, Kiss, the Ramones, Guns N' Roses, the Damned, and The Smiths, whose frontman Morrissey organized a reunion show for the New York Dolls' surviving members in 2004.

The original intent of Nil was to become Tetsu's solo unit and even though it has become a full fledged band, all lyrics and songwriting has been solely handled by Tetsu. The band only lasted briefly during its first incarnation and went on hiatus by the end of 1998. It would not resurface until the middle of 2002 when they would start recording again and Tetsu formed his own record label, Afro Skull Records. The name \"Nil\" literally means \"absolute zero\" and as an acronym refers to \"native irreligious language\". In 2005, Nil had many setbacks which resulted in the departure of founding members Kashimoto and Moro who both left the band on January 10, 2005, the last day of the \"Touring Inferno\" tour. Eventually replacement drummer Furuton (ex-Oblivion Dust, ex-Mega8Ball support) left the band after only 6 months. By the end of 2005 Nil finally settled down with the addition of Masaru Kobayashi (ex-Soy Sauce Sonix, ex-Sads, The Cro-Magnons) on bass and Kazama Hiroyuki (ex-Fantastic Designs) on drums. In the years since resuming activities, Nil has recorded and released 5 full albums, 7 mini albums, 1 cover album, 1 live album, 1 compilation album, 3 singles, 2 fan-club only CDs and 8 DVDs.

	dbo:abstract	"Petra is a music group regarded as a pioneer of the Christian rock and contemporary Christian music genres. Formed in 1972, the band took its name from the Greek word for \"rock\". Though they disbanded formally in 2006, incarnations of Petra have played reunion shows in the years since and released an album in November 2010. In 2013, the band returned from retirement with a new drummer Cristian Borneo and recorded a new song titled \"Holy is Your Name\", as well as going back on tour. With a style initially similar to The Eagles and Lynyrd Skynyrd, Petra's sound evolved into a more energetic, driving rock sound in the early 1980s akin to Foreigner, Styx and Journey. Throughout the 1980s and into the early 1990s, Petra was one of the world's most popular Christian rock bands, with each of its albums during that period selling hundreds of thousands of copies while the band sold out arenas and regularly placed songs at the top of Christian radio charts. With its lyrics, music and style, Petra influenced numerous other artists at a time when Christian rock experienced strong opposition from many conservative pastors and churches. In more than three decades, the band experienced numerous lineup changes yet released 20 studio albums, as well as three Spanish-language and two live albums, selling nearly 10 million copies while being nominated for 13 Grammy Awards, winning four, and winning 10 Dove Awards. Its biggest hit, \"The Coloring Song,\" reached the top position on three Christian radio charts simultaneously, and at its peak, the band's tours rivaled Amy Grant's in popularity among Christian audiences. Petra was the first rock band inducted into the Gospel Music Hall of Fame and the first Christian band whose memorabilia was included in the Hard Rock Cafe restaurant chain. The band announced its retirement in 2005, launching a farewell tour that was recorded for release on CD and DVD. Petra's 33-year career ended with a performance in the early hours of January 1, 2006, in Murphy, North Carolina. However, the band has continued to perform sporadically since then. In November 2010, an incarnation of the band's mid-1980s lineup surfaced under the name Classic Petra. They released a CD titled Back to the Rock featuring two new songs as well as re-recordings of hits from that era. The band released a companion live CD and DVD in 2011."@en ;

The band has released 14 studio albums, one EP and several DVDs, and continues to tour and record. The original lineup consisted of vocalist Geoff Tate, guitarists Chris DeGarmo and Michael Wilton, bassist Eddie Jackson and drummer Scott Rockenfield. Queensr\u00FFche has sold over 20 million albums worldwide, including over 6 million albums in the United States. The band received worldwide acclaim after the release of their 1988 album Operation: Mindcrime, which is often considered one of the greatest concept albums of all time.[citation needed] Their follow-up release, Empire, released in 1990, was also very successful and included the hit single \"Silent Lucidity\". The band has received three Grammy Award nominations for songs off both albums. In 1998, drummer Rockenfield received an individual Grammy nomination. In 1997, guitarist and primary songwriter DeGarmo left the band for personal reasons. Over the years, his replacements have been Kelly Gray, Mike Stone, and Parker Lundgren, respectively. Following a highly publicized backstage altercation before a show in S\u00E3o Paulo, Brazil in April 2012, Tate was fired from the band and replaced with then-Crimson Glory singer Todd La Torre. In response to his dismissal, Tate and his wife Susan (who served as the band's manager from 2005\u20132012) filed a lawsuit in a Washington court, claiming that he was wrongfully terminated. The ruling in the preliminary injunction was that both parties were allowed to use the name Queensr\u00FFche until a court ruling or a settlement decides who gets to use the name. A settlement was reached on April 17, 2014, in which founding members Wilton, Rockenfield and Jackson were awarded the rights to the band trademark, continuing to play with the lineup that additionally includes singer La Torre and guitarist Lundgren.

dbr:Quiet_Riot	rdf:type	dbo:Band ;
	dbo:abstract	"Quiet Riot is an American heavy metal band, best known for their hit singles \"Metal Health\" and \"Cum on Feel the Noize\". The band was founded in 1973, by guitarist Randy Rhoads and bassist Kelly Garni under the name Mach 1. They then changed the name to Little Women, before settling on Quiet Riot in May 1975. The band's name was inspired by a conversation with Rick Parfitt of the British band Status Quo, in which Parfitt said he'd like to name a band \"Quite Right\", and his thick English accent made it sound like he was saying \"Quiet Riot\". The band is ranked at No. 100 on VH1's 100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock. The original line-up featured Rhoads and Garni with lead vocalist Kevin DuBrow and drummer Drew Forsyth. Their most commercially successful lineup consisted of DuBrow alongside guitarist Carlos Cavazo, bassist Rudy Sarzo and drummer Frankie Banali, and in 1983 released their breakthrough album Metal Health, which is known for being the first heavy metal album to top the Billboard album chart. Despite several lineup changes and brief breakups, Quiet Riot continued to record and tour until DuBrow's death from an accidental cocaine overdose in 2007. Banali revived the band in 2010, and the current lineup consists of himself on drums, lead vocalist Jizzy Pearl, bassist Chuck Wright and guitarist Alex Grossi. After eight years without published works, the band released their twelfth studio album in 2014, entitled 10, the first since the band's reformation following the death of Kevin DuBrow."@en ;

Their next two albums, The Sufferer & the Witness (2006) and Appeal to Reason (2008), were also successful and peaked at number ten and number three on the Billboard 200 chart, respectively. Appeal to Reason was followed three years later by Endgame (2011).

	dbo:abstract	"Second Person were a British band that existed for 10 years between 2001 and 2011 and mixed influences from trip hop, jazz, hip hop and electronica to form post-trip hop . In late 2001, singer Julia Johnson and producer/bassist Mark Maclaine met, and early the following year formed the band Second Person. Drummer \u00C1lvaro L\u00F3pez was recruited in mid-2004 to complete the final line up and their debut album Chromatography was released later that year. It went on to sell out of its initial white-label run in United Kingdom, USA and Australia through word of mouth and publicity generated by musical placements on documentaries and extreme sports films. The opening song \"Too Cold To Snow\" was later featured in the closing credits of 2006 film Dolls. The band went on to record a live DVD at The Bedford in London, score music for a number of British broadcasters (including BBC and Channel 4) and became one of the main suppliers of music for the international broadcaster: The Extreme Sports Channel. The band released their second album The Elements on 9 August 2007, it was co-produced and mixed by producer/engineer Tony Platt (Bob Marley, Iron Maiden and also credited with engineering the second biggest selling album of all time: AC/DC's Back in Black). This album gained a high media profile in Europe as Second Person were the first British band to have raised the $50,000 target on Sellaband - which allowed fans to invest directly in bands on the site. Julia and Mark composed the music for the British feature film City Rats, starring Danny Dyer and Tamer Hassan and released in the cinemas in April 2009. The film reached number 6 in the UK DVD charts and went on to sell over 400,000 copies world-wide . The band announced their split on 2 April 2011 , along with the release of their third and final album: \"Come to Dust\". This full length album includes songs such as Gone Fishing, the video for which (directed by Katy Davis) gained extensive play on MTV and was used as part of Cobra Beer's sponsorship of ITV movies in the UK. Other video directors include: Ebba Erikzon (Radiohead's \"2+2=5\" video), Mina Song (Gnarls Barkley: \"Crazy\"), Everton Sebben and Mark Maclaine. In a final email to their fans the band wrote: \"Second Person has always been an expression of our combined love of many styles of music and was founded on a shared desire to tell powerful stories. We had to do this during times of big change in the music industry, and although sometimes scary, it also allowed us to do things our own way. Something that kept us going was the support and love of a core group of dedicated fans. You are those people and we wanted to thank you for being there for us.\""@en ;

Steps formed in May 1997 and released four studio albums, three compilation albums and seventeen singles. Their music has a 1990s dance-pop, house, electropop and bubblegum dance sound. Their name was based on a marketing premise: that each of their music videos were to be choreographed, and the dance steps were included in the sleeve with most of their singles. Steps achieved a series of charting singles between 1997 and 2001 including two number-one singles in the UK (one a double A-side), two number-one albums in the UK, 14 consecutive top 5 singles in the UK and a string of hits throughout Europe. The group has sold over 20 million records worldwide in addition to acquiring a BRIT Award nomination in 1999 for Best Newcomer while supporting Britney Spears on tour the same year. When Richards and Watkins departed, the group disbanded on 26 December 2001. Their penultimate single reached number five in the UK charts while their final album of greatest hits, Gold (2001), was the group's second number-one album in the UK. Steps reformed in May 2011 for a four-part documentary series on Sky Living titled Steps: Reunion. The series started airing on 28 September, following an announcement of a second Greatest Hits album, The Ultimate Collection, that was released on 10 October 2011. The album entered the charts at number 1, becoming the band's third UK number 1 album. Series 2 of Steps Reunion titled \"Steps: On the Road Again\" aired on Sky Living in April 2012; the series followed the band as they embarked on their sellout 22-date UK tour.

Lance rejoined the line-up for the 2004 release party of Sex Objects, but retired from the band in 2005. Kicks has since become a permanent addition and was a full member for the follow-up, Steal Yer Heart. Lyrically the Briefs have carried on many themes prevalent in `77 era punk rock. The Sex Objects single \"Orange Alert\" gained notoriety as a seething criticism of the Bush administration and the of the culture of fear in post-9/11 America. It is one of a number of their songs critical of the U.S. Government, including \"No More Presidents\" and \"Destroy The USA\" from Sex Objects, and \"We Americans\" from Off the Charts. The band has also written a number of love songs in a consciously off-kilter style, similar to the Buzzcocks' \"Orgasm Addict.\" With songs like \"Dolly Parton\", the band has also illustrated their penchant for light-hearted absurdity. In 2007, the Briefs released a feature-length documentary about the band, entitled The Greatest Story Ever Told, which was directed by the punk filmmaker, Lewis Smithingham. The Briefs are currently on hiatus while Chris Brief is in Germany. Travanti has relocated to California and has joined two other bands. The first, Sharp Objects, has released a 7\" single entitled \"Zero Ambition\", sounding somewhere in the vein of early 80's LA punk. A full-length album from them is reportedly slated for late 2010.[citation needed] The second band is called Modern Action, in which Travanti is joined by members of the bands The Bodies and The Shifters. Modern Action has recorded 2 7\" singles, \"Modern Action\" backed with \"Bleeding Red\", and \"Radioactive Boy\" backed with \"Problem Child\", as well as a full-length LP/CD, Molotov Solution, all of which have been released on Modern Action Records, a label that Travanti co-founded. Nix and Kicks both play in another band called Steve E. Nix and The Cute Lepers, playing a very similar style of music to that of The Briefs, with some added power-pop drive. They have released a 7\" single of the song \"Terminal Boredom\", backed with \"Prove It\", on 1-2-3-4 Go! Records. Two more singles are expected to be released on the European labels NFT and Drunk'n'Roll Records.[citation needed] The Briefs are slated to share the stage with Rancid, NOFX and Pennywise at the 2012 Punk Rock Bowling & Music Festival held in Las Vegas over the Memorial Day weekend. In 2005, The Briefs released a CD called Singles Only which contained all of the songs released on their different 7\" releases to date. In 2012, Modern Action Records re-released Singles Only as a box set with five 7\" records containing all of the songs from the original release. The box set also contained a cassette tape including the first 6 demo songs recorded by the Briefs in 1999. Some additional content was added in the digital download including a more recent 7\" \"The Joy of Killing\" totaling up to 32 songs of Briefs history. In the fall of 2012, The Briefs played a show in Long Beach, Ca with The Stitches and The Bodies. They performed with original bassist Lance Romance but drummer Chris Brief was replaced by the Adolescents drummer as he was unable to return from Germany in time for the show. Then the band went on to play in Texas at the Fun Fun Fun Festival 2 days later and have since slipped back into a dormant state."@en ;

Currently, the band is a touring outfit only. The group has released three original studio albums, of which the last was released in 1990. Each album was recorded by a different line-up; singer-songwriter Andrew Eldritch and the drum machine called Doktor Avalanche are the only points of continuity among the line-ups. Eldritch and Avalanche were also involved in The Sisterhood, a side-project connected with Eldritch's dispute with former members. The group ceased recording activity in 1993, when they went on strike against their record company Time Warner, which they accused of withholding royalties and of incompetence. Although Time Warner eventually let the band go in 1997, they have not signed to another label, and have chosen not to use an independent label, despite showcasing numerous new songs in their live sets. Since 1985, when the other original members left, the Sisters of Mercy has become the artistic vehicle of Eldritch.

The group launched the careers of guitarists Eric Clapton, Jimmy Page and Jeff Beck, all of whom are in the top five of Rolling Stone's 100 Top Guitarists list (Clapton at No. 2, Page at No. 3 and Beck at No. 5). A blues-based band that broadened its range into pop and rock, the Yardbirds had a hand in many electric guitar innovations of the mid-1960s, such as feedback, \"fuzztone\" distortion and improved amplification. Pat Pemberton, writing for Spinner, holds that the Yardbirds were \"the most impressive guitar band in rock music\". After the Yardbirds broke up in 1968, lead guitarist Jimmy Page founded what became Led Zeppelin, while vocalist/harmonica player Keith Relf and drummer Jim McCarty formed the symphonic rock group Renaissance. The bulk of the band's most successful self-written songs came from Relf, McCarty and bassist and producer Paul Samwell-Smith, who, with rhythm guitarist and bassist Chris Dreja, constituted the core of the group. The band reformed in the 1990s, featuring McCarty, Dreja and new members. The Yardbirds were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1992.

The band currently consists of Pat Monahan (vocals), Jimmy Stafford (lead guitar), Jerry Becker (rhythm guitar and piano), Hector Maldonado (bass), Drew Shoals (drums), Nikita Houston (backing vocals) and Sakai Smith (backing vocals). With a lineup that included original members Monahan, Stafford, Scott Underwood, Rob Hotchkiss and Charlie Colin, the band achieved mainstream success with their debut album Train, which was released in 1998 with the hit \"Meet Virginia\". Train's 2001 album, Drops of Jupiter contained the lead single \"Drops of Jupiter (Tell Me)\", which won two Grammy Awards in 2002. The album was certified double platinum in the United States and Canada and remains the band's best-selling album to date. Train's third studio album, My Private Nation, released in 2003, was certified platinum in the United States with the hit \"Calling All Angels\". Following the departures of Hotchkiss and Colin, the band released their fourth album, For Me, It's You in 2006, with Brandon Bush (keyboards) and Johnny Colt (bass). Despite a generally positive reception from critics, the album was commercially unsuccessful. Because of this, Train went on a three-year hiatus. In late 2009, Train released the album Save Me, San Francisco, from which the album's three singles\u2014-the RIAA 6x Platinum-certified international hit \"Hey, Soul Sister\", \"If It's Love\" and \"Marry Me\"\u2014-reached high positions on the Billboard Hot 100 at numbers 3, 34, and 34, respectively. The album itself has been certified gold by both the RIAA and ARIA and has sold 954,000 units. Since 2008, Jerry Becker (guitar, keyboards, backing vocals) and Hector Maldonado (bass, guitar, percussion, backing vocals) have been touring and recording with the group around the world. In May 2012, Nikita Houston (backing vocals, percussion) and Sakai Smith (backing vocals, percussion) joined Train. Following Scott Underwood's departure in summer 2014, Drew Shoals is now the drummer for the band. In April 2012, Train released their sixth studio album titled California 37. The first single from the album entitled \"Drive By\" reached number 10 on the Billboard Hot 100 and was a Top 10 hit in the UK, their first Top 20 single since 2009.

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tweaker_(band)>	rdf:type	dbo:Band ;
	dbo:abstract	"Tweaker is an American alternative rock collaboration founded by Chris Vrenna in the late 1990s. Tweaker's musical style incorporates synthpop, progressive rock, modern jazz and electronica genres, and is characterized by a generally melancholy and sombre sound with distinctive artwork to match. The album The Attraction to All Things Uncertain was Vrenna's \"solo\" debut and it was not until the follow-up album, 2 a.m. Wakeup Call, that Clint Walsh was announced as a permanent fixture to the band. While Vrenna and Walsh supply most instruments and electronics, many other famous musicians have lent their voices and talents to Tweaker, including Robert Smith, David Sylvian, Burton C. Bell, Craig Wedren, Will Oldham, Hamilton Leithauser, Buzz Osborne, Jonathan Bates and Johnny Marr. The albums that have been released follow a central theme that was planned out and this was given to the collaborators. Both albums' cover art were paintings by Joe Sorren. Tweaker wrote and performed the Soundtrack to Doom 3, Of which the theme song was released via the band's website. The rest of the soundtrack is accessible from the game's files. As Chris Vrenna and Clint Walsh, Tweaker did music for the animated television show Xiaolin Showdown. While the Doom 3 theme was Heavy Metal-oriented (to the point of often being misattributed to Tool), most of Tweaker's music presents a unique combination of synthpop, shoegaze, modern jazz, Dark Ambient and industrial. It was rumored for a while that Tweaker would release a new album in 2008, although no new material surfaced, possibly due to Vrenna's duties towards Marilyn Manson, as he worked with Manson on his 2009 album The High End of Low."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"teamAWESOME! is an electropop band with twee sensibilities based in Boulder, Colorado. They are known for their energetic stage presence, which involves props, lightly choreographed dances and audience participation. Their songs tend to have upbeat, childish themes, such as slides, pirates, hand-holding, and rocket ships. teamAWESOME! has been described as \"pure, sloppy, fun '00s bedroom pop\" and is self-described as \"a retro band from the future.\" The band originated in 2005 with two members, Chuck Potashner and Kara Jorge. Since then it has had many line up changes (including a period with nine members), though Potashner had always been the frontman and primary songwriter. Potashner's songs have been characterized as \"whimsical\" and \"richly imagined.\" In late 2005, the band released their first CD, Greatest Hits! Vol 1! on Still Soft Recordings, a DIY record label in Denver, Colorado. The project was partially funded by winnings from placing first at the University of Colorado Battle of the Bands 2005. They have completed four tours of the western United States, preferring to play shows that are all-ages and/or in DIY spaces. Throughout their shows and tours, teamAWESOME! played with The Presidents of the United States of America, Girl Talk, Health, An Albatross, Gravy Train!!!!, Matt & Kim, Tally Hall, Thunderbirds Are Now!, Aqueduct, Dressy Bessy, Mount Eerie and others."@en ;

The band's greatest success was in the early 1980s. Though a part of that era's productive punk rock scene, their music was distinctive for its morbid lyricism and often for its sophisticated arrangements, as heard, for example, on 1981's A Minute to Pray, A Second To Die. Desjardins's poetry has been described as \"wonderful bleeding collages of B-movie dementia, street crime, Mexican Catholicism and Dionysian punk spurt poetics.\" The band recently reformed and tours the Los Angeles area on occasion."@en ;

dbr:Habana_Abierta	rdf:type	dbo:Band ;
	dbo:abstract	"Habana Abierta is a Cuban band. They are a member of a generation of composers, musicians, sculptors, authors, actors, etc. which emerged in the early 90s with its own identity in Havana, even though some of their creations had already been well known for some years in the island's cultural circles. The origins of Habana Abierta go back to a personal project of music duo Gema y P\u00E1vel, who wanted to produce a compilation of everything they and their peers had been doing in Havana clubs with hardly any resources. Initially, Luis Alberto Barber\u00EDa, Pepe del Valle, Carlos Santos, Boris Larramendi, Superavit, Andy Villal\u00F3n, Kelvis Ochoa and Jos\u00E9 Luis Medina, backed by the NUBENEGRA recording label, gave us a first glimpse released under the name Habana Oculta. In July 1996 most of them travelled to Spain (except for Carlos Santos, Ra\u00FAl Ciro and Alejandro Fr\u00F3meta: Super\u00E1vit) to showcase their music at several festivals and clubs, and very soon spurred interest among audiences and the media alike, and even well-known Spanish artists and musicians. Ana Bel\u00E9n and V\u00EDctor Manuel, along with Ketama, were the first to show an interest and to take the initiative in a gradual and rich exchange with our Habana Abierta, which whom they made music in Spain. BMG Ariola asked Gema y P\u00E1vel to come up with a project bringing a group of highly different singer-songwriters together on the album, based on the individuality of each member yet with combined expression of the diverse unity of Cuban music. Then Vanito Brown and Alejandro Guti\u00E9rrez joined what was to become Habana Abierta, recording a new album under this name. They played over 80 gigs throughout Spain in 1997, 50 of them in Madrid and in 1998 recorded am album with the line-up down to 6, as Andy and Barber\u00EDa had left to branch out on their own. With 24 Horas, the second album with Habana Abierta, an eclectic line was followed with some tracks from previous recordings, with a more defined fusion between popular Cuban music and funk, reggae and hip-hop. Rock and Pop Cuban-style with national roots: Van Van by Juan Fromel, Irakere by Chucho Vald\u00E9s or NG la Banda by Jos\u00E9 Luis Cort\u00E9s, refrains attributed to Matamoros over Red Hot Chili Peppers or Rolling Stones riffs. Conga-funk, timba-rock, bolero-hop, chachacha-blues, son and pop.... In January 2003, after six years in Spain, they returned to Cuba for a series of sell-out individual shows, with a performance by the Habana Abierta full line-up at La Tropical, playing to with over 10,000 people. This gave rise to the Habana Abierta documentary directed by Jorge Perugorr\u00EDa and Arturo Soto, which was presented at several film festivals."@en ;

Following the delayed release of Red House Painters' final studio album, Old Ramon (2001), vocalist and guitarist Kozelek began recording new material under the name Sun Kil Moon with bandmates Anthony Koutsos (drums) and Jerry Vessel (bass), alongside Geoff Stanfield and Tim Mooney. The resulting album, Ghosts of the Great Highway, was released in 2003 to widespread critical acclaim. The project's second studio album, Tiny Cities (2005), was composed entirely of Modest Mouse cover songs. In 2008, the band released its third studio album, April. Recorded as a three-piece by Kozelek, Koutsos and Stanfield, the album was well received and featured guest vocal appearances from noted indie rock musicians Will Oldham and Ben Gibbard. Inspired by classical guitar music, Kozelek recorded Sun Kil Moon's fourth studio album, Admiral Fell Promises (2010), as a solo act, and continued to record mostly alone on its follow-up, Among the Leaves (2012). In 2013, Kozelek released three studio albums under his own name before releasing Sun Kil Moon's sixth studio album, Benji, in February 2014, to widespread critical acclaim and increased exposure.

The band entered the Irish Singles Chart at number two and spawned four singles, the top three track \"Trust Me, I'm A Doctor\" plus \"The Reason\", \"Postcards\" and \"Buy It Sell It\". In 2009, they signed a UK record deal with Island Records which would see the release of Domino Effect there. The band perform annually at Oxegen, have headlined Indiependence and also supported Oasis at Slane Concert in June 2009. Other bands they have supported include Kaiser Chiefs, The Prodigy and AC/DC during their Black Ice World Tour. A headline show at Dublin's Olympia Theatre on 12 December 2009 was their last before they went on hiatus. In May 2010 as frontman Niall Breslin (Bressie) was away in London pursuing his career as a music producer, the other four members formed an 80's cover band entitled \"House Party\" playing shows in Dublin's Crawdaddy venue and Sligo's Garavogue Bar. Bass player Anto Doran and Drummer Dec Murphy can now be seen behind the bar of John Daly's Bar in their hometown of Mullingar which they now manage together."@en ;

dbr:The_Sea_and_Cake	rdf:type	dbo:Band ;
	dbo:abstract	"The Sea and Cake is an indie rock band with a jazz influence based in Chicago. The group formed in the mid-1990s from members of The Coctails (Archer Prewitt), Shrimp Boat (Sam Prekop and Eric Claridge), and Tortoise (John McEntire); the group's name came from a willful reinterpretation (as the result of an accidental miscomprehension) of \"The C in Cake\", a song by Gastr del Sol. Starting with 1997's The Fawn, the group has relied on electronic sound sources, such as drum machines and synthesizers, to color its music, but has retained its distinctive post-jazz combo style. The band has shied away from releasing singles, preferring the album format. Contrary to his multi-instrumentalist role in Tortoise, John McEntire almost exclusively plays drums in The Sea and Cake. Members Sam Prekop, Archer Prewitt, and John McEntire each have released solo albums. The cover art of The Sea And Cake's releases are largely paintings by member Eric Claridge and photographs by Prekop. (Postcards of some of the One Bedroom-era photos were sold on the band's 2003 tour.) Prewitt has been involved in publishing his own comic books and doing graphic design. The band was on hiatus from 2004 to 2007, returning with Everybody. Their eighth studio album, Car Alarm, was released in October 2008. Their most recent studio album, \"Runner\" was released in 2012. In 1995, the band contributed the song \"The Fontana\" to the AIDS benefit album Red Hot + Bothered produced by the Red Hot Organization. In October 2010, the band released \"Skies\" as a special single to accompany their tour with Broken Social Scene."@en ;

Although the rest of the line-up has changed occasionally, for most of the time the other members have been Michael Wells, Glenn Slater and Terri Moeller. The band draws inspiration from folk and country music, particularly Townes Van Zandt, Neil Young and Johnny Cash, but also from other types of artists and musical styles such as Scott Walker, Leonard Cohen, French chanson and Jacques Brel. Their sound is typically rich, with string arrangements and keyboards in addition to the standard rock instruments. In reviews the band's music is often described as melancholic or mellow, while Eckman's lyrics, concerning such themes as human relations, loneliness and restlessness, are often emphasized as poetic. The Walkabouts have achieved commercial success and a strong fanbase in Europe, where they have done promotion and extensive touring since early 1990s. They have occasionally even made it high on the record charts in countries such as Greece and Norway."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Tit\u00E3s ([t\u0283i\u02C8t\u0250\u0303s]) are a rock band from S\u00E3o Paulo, Brazil. Though they basically play pop/alternative rock, their music has touched a number of other styles throughout their 30-year career, such as new wave, punk rock, grunge, MPB and electronic music. They are one of the most successful rock bands in Brazil, having sold more than 6.3 million albums and having been covered by several well-known Brazilian artists and a couple of international singers. They were awarded a Latin Grammy in 2009 and have won the Imprensa Trophy for Best Band a record four times. Tit\u00E3s started with a rather unusual line-up of nine members (including six lead vocalists): Nando Reis (bass guitar, vocals), Branco Mello (vocals), Marcelo Fromer (Rhythm guitar), Arnaldo Antunes (vocals), Tony Bellotto (Lead guitar), Paulo Miklos (sax, mandolin, harmonica, vocals), Andr\u00E9 Jung (drums), S\u00E9rgio Britto (keyboards, vocals) and Ciro Pessoa (vocals). Pessoa quickly left the band even before their debut album, Tit\u00E3s, was released. Andr\u00E9 Jung was the initial drummer, but just after Tit\u00E3s he also quit and was replaced by Charles Gavin, establishing their classic line-up. Since then, the band lost four members who were never officially replaced: in 1992, Antunes left to pursue a solo career. In 2002, Fromer died after being hit by a motorcycle in S\u00E3o Paulo. Six months later, Reis also left the group to focus on his solo albums. The most recent change was the departure of Gavin, in 2010, due to personal reasons. After Fromer's death and Reis' departure, the band performed with some session guitarists and bassists, but ended up having Mello and Britto as full-time bassists (with Britto performing only when Mello sings) and Miklos as the rhythm guitarist. After Gavin left, the band has been working with Mario Fabre, a session drummer. The band has released their latest album in May 2014, titled Nheengatu."@en ;

dbr:Within_Temptation	rdf:type	dbo:Band ;
	dbo:abstract	"Within Temptation is a Dutch symphonic metal band founded in 1996 by vocalist Sharon den Adel and guitarist Robert Westerholt. They have always been classified by critics as gothic metal or rock, although the \"gothic\" influence varies with each album. Their most prominent and well-known sound is described as symphonic metal, although their earlier material, such as debut album Enter, was mostly gothic metal. Enter even had a hint of doom metal. In an interview, Den Adel said they fell into a symphonic rock genre with various influences. In a later interview with Dutch music platform 3VOOR12, den Adel stated that \"we consider ourselves more a symphonic rock band ... in my opinion, we are no gothic band\". After the release of their debut album Enter in 1997, the band became prominent in the Dutch underground scene. It was not until 2001 that they became known to the general public, with the single \"Ice Queen\" from their second album Mother Earth, which reached No. 2 on the Dutch charts. This was followed by the band winning the Conamus Exportprijs, a Dutch music award, four years in a row. Their next albums The Silent Force (2004) and The Heart of Everything (2007) debuted at No. 1 on the Dutch charts. In 2008, they released a live DVD and CD, Black Symphony, recorded with the Metropole Orchestra. This was followed in 2009 by An Acoustic Night at the Theatre, another live album. The band's fifth studio album, The Unforgiving, was released in March 2011, alongside both a comic book series and a series of short films that together encompass a story. The first single, \"Faster\", was released on January 21, and the first short film, Mother Maiden, was released on January 31. The band has sold more than 3 million copies of the album worldwide. Their sixth studio album, Hydra, was released on January 22, 2014 in Japan, on January 31, 2014 in Europe, and on February 4, 2014 in the United States. The album features guest appearances from various artists: Finnish singer Tarja Turunen, who appears in the lead single \"Paradise (What About Us?)\"; Howard Jones, former vocalist of American metalcore band Killswitch Engage; Dave Pirner, lead vocalist of American alternative rock band Soul Asylum; and American rapper Xzibit. The band had extensive airplay on BBC Radio 2 in the United Kingdom with one of the songs from the album, \"Whole World Is Watching\" featuring Pirner. The band is currently working on new material and is due to tour The Netherlands as part of their \"Theater Tour\", a seated show. During 2014, they parted ways with artist management agency AT Productions and signed with Martijn Swier, with whom they had been working for many years."@en ;

They have released ten full-length albums and are cited as a formative influence on the skate punk subgenre. In their early years, SNFU built an audience across North America through energetic live performances and a dynamic punk sound. Their 1985 debut album ...And No One Else Wanted to Play has remained influential in underground circuits. They grew in popularity following two further studio albums, but disbanded in 1989 due to internal tensions. SNFU reformed two years later, however, in a second incarnation which found greater success. They signed with the prominent indie label Epitaph Records, achieved six-digit record sales and toured in support of larger groups. They became independent in 1997 after the expiration of their contract with Epitaph. They again disbanded in 2005, only to reform two years later. The group is fronted by the eccentric singer, lyricist, and artist Ken Chinn, credited as Mr. Chi Pig. Founding members and twin brothers Brent and Marc Belke helped create the band's melodic hardcore punk sound with dual guitar work before their departures in 1998 and 2005, respectively. Nearly 30 musicians have played in the group, with only Chinn remaining constant. Since 2014, the band has consisted of Chinn, bassist Dave Bacon, guitarists Randy Steffes and Kurt Robertson, and drummer Jamie Oliver."@en ;

The band got their name from the album Pornograffitti by the band Extreme. They currently record under the SME Records label. Haruichi Shind\u014D originally formed the band with his cousin during high school and named it \"No Score.\" After the band started, Haruichi asked Akihito Okano and Masami \"Tama\" Shiratama to join. The band was so named because none of them could actually read a score when they first started. When they first started the band, Haruichi was the vocalist, but found out that Akihito could sing better, so he gave the vocalist position to Akihito and took over as guitarist instead. This was the foundation of Porno Graffitti. They debuted with the song Apollo in 1999. Their two subsequent CD singles, Saudade and Agehach\u014D, both sold over a million copies in Japan. They are also well known for the song Melissa, which was used as the opening theme of the anime series Fullmetal Alchemist in 2003. They also created the song Hitori no Yoru, used as the second opening theme of the anime series GTO in 2000, and Winding Road, used as the ending theme of the anime series Ayakashi Ayashi in 2006. A cover of their 2000 single Music Hour was featured in a stage of the Nintendo DS rhythm game Moero! Nekketsu Rhythm Damashii Osu! Tatakae! Ouendan 2. Their single Koyoi, Tsuki ga, Miezu Tomo was featured in the third Bleach film, and their single Anima Rossa was featured as the eleventh opening to Bleach. Their single \"2012Spark\" was featured as the main theme song of the movie Gyakuten Saiban. Their single \"Matataku Hoshi no Shita de\" is the second opening theme for the anime Magi: The Labyrinth of Magic. Their newest single, \"Oh! Rival\", was released in 2015 and is part of the soundtrack for the new Detective Conan film."@en ;

dbr:Svenne_and_Lotta	rdf:type	dbo:Band ;
	dbo:abstract	"Svenne & Lotta (in some countries Sven & Charlotte) was a pop duo with Svenne Hedlund and Lotta Hedlund. They met in 1967, when (along with ABBA's Benny Andersson) Svenne Hedlund was the vocalist in the band Hep Stars. Charlotte Walker, which was Lotta Hedlund's name at that time, toured Sweden with the all-girl American trio The Sherrys. The Hep Stars' phenomenal success within Scandinavia is well documented, and as an authentic, American soul group, the Sherrys were a European touring success story. It was at Jerry Williams' 'Hamburger b\u00F6rs' show that the couple met, after which they spent time together during the Swedish leg of Lotta's concert tour with the Sherrys. Upon Lotta's return to America, the pair missed each other so greatly that Lotta soon travelled back to Sweden; this time with her three children. Seeking parental approval, Lotta also brought her mother to meet Svenne. With the Hep Stars' popularity diminishing, Lotta was brought in as a new member of the band, along with Benny's songwriting colleague, Bj\u00F6rn Ulvaeus. This constellation released two studio albums on their own record label Romance Records, Compromise and Tillsammans. The new line-up didn't last long however, with Benny and Bj\u00F6rn setting their sights on international stardom with their fianc\u00E9s, Anni-Frid Lyngstad and Agnetha F\u00E4ltskog. Aiming to follow in ABBA's victorious footsteps, Svenne and Lotta competed in the Swedish heats for the Eurovision Song Contest, Melodifestivalen 1975, with the song \"Bang en boomerang\", but finished 3rd. The song however became their breakthrough in Scandinavia, and the duo became especially popular in Denmark. In the early 1980s they even took the very unusual step of recording a Danish language version of their Swedish hit \"N\u00E4r Dagen F\u00F6rsvinner\" (a cover of Alan Sorrenti's \"Tu sei l'unica donna per me\"), retitled \"N\u00E5r Dagen Forsvinder\". As artists on the Polar Music International record label, owned by ABBA's manager Stig Anderson, Svenne & Lotta released various singles and albums produced by Benny and Bj\u00F6rn. These mainly consisted of covers of 1960s hits, later on their own material. Throughout the years they got more songs delivered by their producers, like \"If We Only Had the Time\" and \"Roly Poly Girl\", both previously recorded in Swedish by Bj\u00F6rn and Benny as \"T\u00E4nk om jorden vore ung\" and \"K\u00E4ra gamla sol\" respectively on their 1970 album \"Lycka\". Most notable of all is arguably \"Funky Feet\", included on Svenne & Lotta's 1976 album Letters; originally written for ABBA's Arrival album, Benny and Bj\u00F6rn felt it was too similar to the already-recorded \"Dancing Queen\"; one of two officially released recordings of the track; the other being Australian pop duo The Studs, who scored a Top 10 in Australia in 1977 with the song. In 1974 the group released a cover of ABBA's \"Dance (While the Music Still Goes On)\" as a single in Australia, backed with a version of \"He Is Your Brother\". The single was produced by ABBA's Bj\u00F6rn and Benny and the duo subsequently also recorded a Swedish language version of the A-side, entitled \"Kom ta en sista dans med mig\", which became a major Svensktoppen hit in 1975. In 1980 Svenne & Lotta signed with Sonet Records and released three albums produced by Ola H\u00E5kansson, at the time lead singer with the band Secret Service. The albums featured material written by among others H\u00E5kansson, Peo Thyr\u00E9n, Tim Norell and Alexander Bard, who also went on to find international success with Army of Lovers in the 1990s. While most husband and wife teams with close connections to ABBA eventually separated, Svenne and Lotta have remained together until 2014 when they divorced. [1] Since the early 1980s the couple resides in S\u00E4vsj\u00F6, Sm\u00E5land and since the early 1990s they have frequently toured Scandinavia, occasionally under the moniker The Hep Stars. After year 2000 Sven teamed up with some other Swedish 1960s male singers as the act Idolerna (The Idols). In 2000 the duo returned to Melodifestivalen, as they sang \"Bara du och jag\" with Swedish rappers Balsam Boys (Gustav Eur\u00E9n and Stefan Deak). In 2005 they also made a special anniversary appearance in the show, performing \"Bang-A-Boomerang\" 30 years after they first competed with the song. Svenne & Lotta, or Sven & Charlotte, remained active and released records in Swedish, English, and Danish until their divorce in 2014. Svenne was last known to be living as a recluse in the backwoods of the Pacific Northwest."@en ;

The style stated by the band on their 2000 demo was rather experimental, with the use of female vocals, death growls, some melodic vocals with a touch of groove. After the release of their debut album the line up of Sun Caged changed considerably. When the recordings of Artemisia had started, Coenen was the only band member left from the original line up. Leeflang left shortly after the release of the band's debut to pursue a musical career in New York and was replaced by Roel van Helden. After singer Andr\u00E9 Vuurboom left to form Sphere Of Souls he was replaced by the American Paul Adrian Villarreal. With the departure of Vuurboom keyboard player Joost van den Broek also parted ways with Sun Caged to join After Forever, a Dutch gothic metal outfit. Ren\u00E9 Kroon was hired as Van den Broek's substitute. Shortly before the Artemisia recording sessions bass player Rob van der Loo left as well. He went to join Dutch gothic metal band Delain and was replaced by Roel Vink. The band's third studio album, The Lotus Effect, was released on June 17, 2011 through Lion Music. It was described as a balance between their eponymous debut and the more melodic second album, Artemisia."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Gore Gore Girls are an all female garage rock band from Detroit, Michigan, formed in 1997 by singer/songwriter Amy Gore. The band's name comes from The Gore Gore Girls, a 1972 B-movie by Herschell Gordon Lewis, which is a parody of the term Go Go Girls. Like fellow Detroit bands The White Stripes and The Detroit Cobras, the band started out struggling through the local club circuit before being \"discovered\" by independent record label Get Hip Records in 1998. Their first single \"Mama in the Movies\" (1999) gained favourable airplay on college radio stations in Michigan, which led to recording their first full-length album Strange Girls in (2000). The second album Up All Night, was released in 2002 and received positive press from the Village Voice and Detroit Free Press. During this time the band toured Europe twice, in 2002 and in 2003, also with infrequent dates in the United States. The band became a four-piece in 2004 with the addition of The Hammer (Marlene Hammerle) on guitar and began touring the United States extensively. Gore Gore Girls toured as direct support for The Cramps in 2003 and 2004. The band released an EP in 2004, 7 X 4, which became part of their third album, Get the Gore. Tracks from the EP and subsequent third album received airplay on Little Steven's Underground Garage Program on Sirius Satellite Radio; the band was featured at Little Steven's Underground Garage Festival on Randall's Island, New York along with other 'garage rock' luminaries and legends The Stooges, The Strokes, The New York Dolls, The Zombies and others. Get the Gore, released in 2007 on Bloodshot Records, was recorded at Ghetto Recorders in Detroit, Michigan and received positive press from USA Today and Playboy Magazine. Gore Gore Girls toured Europe again in spring of 2008, the band's third tour of Scandinavia and Western European countries."@en ;

The song \"Seven Days of Lonely\" was put iTunes as the service's \"free single of the week\" from February 19, 2008 - February 25, 2008. In the April 5, 2008 issue of Billboard, I Nine's second single \"If This Room Could Move,\" which was produced by Nickelback's Chad Kroeger, received a spotlight review by editor Chuck Taylor: \"I Nine catapulted out of native South Carolina when Cameron Crowe invited the quartet to appear on the motion pic soundtrack for his Elizabethtown. At year-end 2007, it grazed the adult top 40 top 25 with \"Seven Days of Lonely,\" the debut from upcoming CD Heavy Weighs the King \u2014 but that pep pill was a mere taste of the group\u2019s prowess. Sunny follow-up \"If This Room Could Move\" is garnering hype because Chad Kroeger produced \u2014 all well and good but bragging rights are earned on its own merits: an ambrosial vocal from Carmen Keigans, divine start-and-stop tempo, and instrumental elements that blend \u201890s jangle-rock with Brit pop. On record, they sound like a blissful union of Jewel and Sixpence None the Richer \u2014 if more Avril Lavigne live. With two exquisite singles in a row, I Nine is counting down to name-brand status.

The project is currently on hold as Fred is focusing on his new band, Terrible Things with Andy Jackson and Josh Eppard. On the The Color Fred's Myspace page, Fred said the following about his solo project: \"A lot of people have been asking about TCF as well. I still love all the songs I've put out through that so it will continue to be my solo project that I'll do when the new band is on break... if it ever is! But I really feel that if you were ever a fan of the music I've been so lucky to make over the years, you won't be let down by the Terrible Things record. I want to thank you guys especially for supporting me all these years and especially during the last 2 years while I was rebuilding and rethinking everything about what I do. It really helped to have my TCF fans when things got hard. I won't let you guys down-Fred\" In 2012, Fred toured as The Color Fred for the Super Karate Tour"@en ;

dbr:Roger_Miret_and_The_Disasters	rdf:type	dbo:Band ;
	dbo:abstract	"Roger Miret and the Disasters are a street punk group formed by Agnostic Front frontman Roger Miret. The band started when Miret was writing songs that were not a style suitable for Lady Luck (a band fronted by his wife Denise) or Agnostic Front, so he starting recording them on his own on a Boss recorder. Johnny Rioux had previously mentioned he would like to work with him, so Rioux helped Miret on what originally started as a solo project. Then Miret met Rhys Kill, who liked the material and joined in on the project. The band then recorded a demo tape, with Miret and Kill on guitar, Rioux on bass and Matt Kelly from the Dropkick Murphys on drums. That six-song demo found reviewed by Lars Frederiksen, who passed it off to his Rancid bandmate Tim Armstrong. He asked Miret to put his project out on Hellcat Records. As Kelly could not continue with Miret due to his commitments with Dropkick Murphys, Miret asked Johnny Kray of The Krays and New York Rel-X to join on drums. After a couple rehearsals, they decided to make it a band. Their first recorded appearances were in 2001, with \"It's Alright\", from the six-song demo with Matt Kelly, appearing on Scene Killer 3 and covers of Cock Sparrer's \"England Belongs to Me\" (dubbed \"New York Belongs to Me\") and Blitz's \"Voice of a Generation\" appearing on The Worldwide Tribute to the Real Oi! Volume 2. Their debut release was their self-titled album, which came out in September 2002. The band's first lineup change came with Joey Nails replacing Rioux on bass by August 2003. It was then announced in January 2004 that Chris Watson replaced Nails and then Brian Darwas took over for drums as of April 2004, leaving only Miret and Kill as original members. Following one more lineup change, with Darwas moving over to bass and Mike Mulieri taking over drums as of September 2004, the band recorded their second album in Fall 2004. The album, 1984, was released early the next year and became their last release on Hellcat. The next year, they released My Riot on Sailor's Grave Records. In January 2011, the band released their fourth album, Gotta Get Up Now, on German label People Like You Records."@en ;

The track rose to popularity at DJ Ron Hardy's Music Box club in Chicago and has since been re-pressed many times. Phuture released a great number of acid tracks now considered classics, usually as 12-inch vinyl maxi singles. The music the group produces is dark and monotonous. Many tracks are very long, even passing the 10-minute mark (such as \"Acid Tracks\"). Sparse lyrics are occasionally related to drugs, like the lyrics of \"Your Only Friend\" (1987), which describe cocaine addiction, or a simple chant, such as on \"Spirit\" (1994). The group also recorded under several pseudonyms, generally using the substitution of ph or pf for f. For example, the name Phortune or Pfortune."@en ;

Before Bob Brannigan and Steve McCabe met, Steve was playing in a two-piece band at Cashmere High School called The Gorillas with Peter Rees, evolving comix maestro and classical guitarist. Brannigan and McCabe met through a mutual friend and played gigs in Christchurch and Dunedin under many names including The Whining Plums, Hey, We're Wolves and The Twins in the early '80s. It was at a Twins gig at the notorious Empire Tavern in Dunedin in 1983 where Stu Kawowski was first unable to control himself and leapt on stage to commandeer the bongos, instantly adding another dimension to the unit. Art School Photography graduate, photography guru, filmmaker, artist, promotional maverick and explosives expert Kawowski was playing drums with Above Ground, Bill Direen's band at the time he met the other members of the Axemen and soon 'joined' the Axemen as a permanent fixture. Brannigan, McCabe and Kawowski remained the 'core' of the Axemen in the 20th century, however many New Zealand musicians played with them over the years as guest / transient / semi-permanent members, making their influence and the influences they assimilated (like the borg) an important breeding ground and virtual swap-meet of ideas and influence in Kiwi music circles. In February 2009, US record label Siltbreeze re-released the Axemen's 1984 protest album :Big Cheap Motel\" on 12\" vinyl. Originally the album was released as a cassette packaged in a small bubble-sleeve with a straw, mimicking the milk drink \"Big M\" that the album was aimed at. The Axemen were invited to play at Christchurch's \"Summertimes\" Festival in January 1984, a public music stage set up in Hagley Park. The band was shocked by the large-scale sexist \"Big M\" advertising surrounding the main stage, and decided to write a suite of protest songs about how the Christchurch City Council had \"sold out\" to the \"Big M\" sexist marketing. The Axemen recorded the concert, as well as studio versions of their songs and released a 45 min cassette entitled, \"Big Cheap Motel\". Siltbreeze later the same year re-released 'Scary! pt III', an experimental album featuring small-form collaborations with sublime Chch artist Lissa Bruce, and multiple band incarnations from the late 80's and early 90's. A four piece Axemen (McCabe, Brannigan, Kawowski & Stojanovic) toured USA extensively for 5 weeks October/November 2009, opening for \"Times New Viking\" (Matador Records).Starting out on the West Coast in Sacramento 27 October, travelling down the West Coast, across the South, up the east to New York then heading west and ending in Chicago on 28 November. The band played 26 shows and covered approx 7,000 miles on the tour. AXEMEN 2009 USA TOUR MAP The Axemen's debut 2xLP \"Three Virgins :: Three Versions :: Three Visions\" was re-issued and released on 7 June 2011 by Siltbreeze. This album was originally released on New Zealand label Flying Nun Records in 1985. The first pressing was 667 copies made at the now closed EMI pressing plant in Lower Hutt, NZ. A mint copy of the 1985 vinyl was \"needle drop\" transferred to digital files at Shadoks Music Studio, Amrum, Germany. Then it was mastered at Fir International, Zaandam, Netherlands, and lacquers cut at Prairie Cat Mastering, Belvidere, IL 61008 USA. The vinyl was pressed at Record Technology Inc., Camarillo, CA 93012-8090, USA. A four-piece AXEMEN incarnation featuring McCabe, Kawowski, Stojanovic and newcomer William Daymond toured Australia in December 2011, a new line up that added William Daymond on bass guitar, allowing Dragan Stojanovic to resume his lead guitar duties. Bob Brannigan declined an invitation to join the band on this tour, due to irreconcilable differences with Steve McCabe. Originally the band were to headline a festival in Wandella, South New South Wales, but due to bureaucratic red tape, this festival was cancelled. The organiser Samuel Miers (School Girl Report) then proceeded to book the AXEMEN into 10 dates starting at Brisbane, and ending in Adelaide on 23 December. The tour was blogged in great detail by Li'l Stevie McCabe on the AXEMEN's Y2k blog. Midway during the Australian tour Steve McCabe's shoulder was fractured after he was attacked by a wild Australian punter. In 2012, the AXEMEN headlined a Christchurch 1980's reunion concert at the Dux Live venue in Christchurch, and also did a mid-winter pair of shows at Mighty Mighty in Wellington 22 June, and Wunderbar Lyttleton on 23 June. The 'Class of 2011' Axemen (McCabe, Kawowski, Stojanovic, Daymond) recorded a new vinyl album 'Sac Tap Nut Jam' in Wellington in 2013 which was released through Spacecase Records, California. 2014 saw the re-release of 1989's Derry Legend on vinyl by Luxury Products USA after 100% analogue re-mastering by Angus McNaughton of Auralax Mastering in Auckland. The re-release package contained a newsprint poster and single sheet fold-out newsprint collection of media reviews and photos from the AXEMEN archives. The re-issue was also available as an audio CD, and as a compact cassette."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Kiss it Goodbye was a hardcore band from Seattle, Washington, USA that existed from 1997 - 1998. After leaving the New Jersey band Deadguy, vocalist Tim Singer and guitarist Keith Huckins moved on to form Kiss it Goodbye with bassist Thom Rusnack and drummer Andrew Gormley. Huckins, Rusnack and Gormley were already familiar musically as they had all previously performed together in the New Jersey band Rorschach. A demo tape was quickly recorded and heavily circulated around the New York City area which responded with high praise. The band decided to leave their New Jersey roots and follow Tim to Seattle. The band recorded their 1997 debut LP She Loves Me, She Loves Me Not for Revelation Records. Produced by Billy Anderson, the album had the same familiar sound that fans of Deadguy and Rorschach had come to know along with Singer's melodramatic screams and ramblings. The tracks \"Preacher\" and \"Target Practice\" which were omitted from She Loves Me.. were also released this same year as a 7\" EP through Revelation. In 1997, the band toured with Unsane. They also toured with death metal outfit Obituary. Shortly after the tour, Huckins decided the touring and music were no longer to his liking and was replaced by Seattle hardcore veteran and Kiss It Goodbye illustrator Demian \"Headboy\" Johnston. The band recorded material in 1998 for an EP that was to be released by Sub Pop Records but was never released by the label as Tim Singer soon decided to leave the band, effectively dissolving it. The tracks were eventually released by Revelation Records as the Choke CD/7\" EP."@en ;

However, their intent was to play music more raw and aggressive than Bird of Ill Omen, and to capture the chaotic-noise aspect of Hondo.

The band was short-lived but managed to sell out all of the printed 7\"s of their first recording To Never Love Again. The band never had an official bass guitar player, but initially Peter Bartsocas did play the bass guitar at shows.

ns27:DC	rdf:type	dbo:Band ;
	dbo:abstract	"AC/DC are an Australian hard rock band, formed in November 1973 by brothers Malcolm and Angus Young, who continued as members until Malcolm's illness and departure in 2014. Commonly referred to as a hard rock or blues rock band, they are also considered pioneers of heavy metal and are sometimes classified as such, though they have always dubbed their music as simply \"rock and roll\". AC/DC underwent several line-up changes before releasing their first album, High Voltage, on 17 February 1975; Malcolm and Angus were the only original members left in the band. Membership subsequently stabilised until bassist Mark Evans was replaced by Cliff Williams in 1977 for the album Powerage. Within months of recording the album Highway to Hell, lead singer and co-songwriter Bon Scott died on 19 February 1980 after a night of heavy alcohol consumption. The group considered disbanding, but buoyed by support from Scott's parents, decided to continue and set about finding a new vocalist. Ex-Geordie singer Brian Johnson was auditioned and selected to replace Scott. Later that year, the band released the new album, Back in Black, which was made as a tribute to Bon Scott. The album launched them to new heights of success and became their all-time best-seller. The band's next album, For Those About to Rock We Salute You, was their first album to reach number one in the United States. AC/DC declined in popularity soon after drummer Phil Rudd was fired in 1983 and was replaced by ex-A II Z drummer Simon Wright, who left to join Dio in 1989. The band experienced a resurgence in the early 1990s with the release of The Razors Edge. Phil Rudd returned in 1994 after Chris Slade, who was with the band from 1989 to 1994, was asked to leave in favour of him, and contributed to the band's 1995 album Ballbreaker. Stiff Upper Lip was released in 2000 and was well received by critics. The band's studio album, Black Ice, was released on 20 October 2008 and was the second-highest-selling album of that year. It was their biggest hit on the charts since For Those About to Rock, eventually reaching No.1 on all charts worldwide. The band's line-up remained the same\u2014their longest unchanged line-up\u2014until 2014 with Malcolm Young's retirement and Rudd's legal troubles. AC/DC have sold more than 200 million records worldwide, including 71.5 million albums in the United States alone, making them the tenth-best-selling band in the United States and one of the world's best-selling bands of all time. Back in Black has sold an estimated 50 million units worldwide, making it the fifth-highest-selling album by any artist \u2013 and the third-highest-selling album by any band. The album has sold 22 million units in the US alone, where it is the sixth-highest-selling album of all time. AC/DC ranked fourth on VH1's list of the \"100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock\" and were named the seventh \"Greatest Heavy Metal Band of All Time\" by MTV. In 2004, AC/DC ranked No. 72 on the Rolling Stone list of the \"100 Greatest Artists of All Time\". Producer Rick Rubin, who wrote an essay on the band for the Rolling Stone list, referred to AC/DC as \"the greatest rock and roll band of all time.\" In 2010, AC/DC were ranked number 23 in the VH1 list of the \"100 Greatest Artists of All Time\"."@en ;

More importantly, it appears that core band members are focused on new projects, so new Ass Ponys output seems unlikely any time soon.

They reunited around 1994 and recorded a reunion album, Oddities, Abnormalities and Curiosities, during the following year, followed by a tour. After that, the Circle Jerks once again parted ways as Hetson was still involved in Bad Religion. They reunited again c. 2001, but as of 2010, are on hiatus. To date, Circle Jerks have released six studio albums, one compilation, a live album and a live DVD. Their last studio album, Oddities, Abnormalities and Curiosities, was released in 1995 and was the band's only reunion album to date.

Since 1979, they have hosted the Cropredy Festival, which is the largest such annual event in England.

The group is composed of eight (formerly nine) members: Taeyeon, Sunny, Tiffany, Hyoyeon, Yuri, Sooyoung, Yoona, and Seohyun. Girls' Generation officially debuted on August 5, 2007 with its debut single \"Into the New World\" and subsequently gained some attention with their self-titled debut album. However, it was not until 2009 that they rose to prominence with the single \"Gee\", which claimed the top spot on KBS's Music Bank for a record-breaking nine consecutive weeks and was named the most popular song of the 2000s decade by Melon. The group solidified their place in the South Korean music industry with follow-up singles \"Tell Me Your Wish (Genie)\", \"Oh!\", and \"Run Devil Run\" from late 2009 to early 2010. In mid-2010, the group signed with Nayutawave Records (present-day EMI Records Japan) to embark into the Japanese music scene. In April 2011, Girls' Generation's Japanese self-titled debut album was released, which peaked atop the Japanese Oricon Albums Chart and became the first album by a South Korean girl group to achieve a double Platinum certification by the RIAJ. The group returned to the South Korean music scene in October 2011 with The Boys, which has sold over 457,000 copies in South Korea, becoming the best-selling album in the Gaon chart history since its launch in 2010. During this time, the group also expanded their endeavor to the United States by signing with Interscope Records. In 2013, Girls' Generation's fourth Korean studio album titled I Got a Boy was released. The title track was subjected to major attention from western media after it was awarded Video of the Year at the inaugural YouTube Music Awards. Girls' Generation has sold over 4.4 million albums and 30 million digital singles as of 2012. The group's immense popularity in its native South Korea has earned them numerous accolades, notably titles such as \"The Nation's Singers\" and \"The Nation's Girl Group\". Girls' Generation is also regarded as the most popular K-pop girl group in Japan alongside Kara; the group is the first South Korean girl group to have two number-one albums on the Japanese Oricon Albums Chart. Korean newspaper Asia Today placed the group at 45 on its 50 Korean Power Leaders list in 2011."@en ;

The album was declared as the best selling album of 2004 on Geo TV by the record label Sadaf Stereo.

The group is widely considered to be one of the founders of the electro-industrial genre. The band's logo consists of the stylized, superimposed letters SP and is a common fan tattoo. Initially envisioned as an experimental side project by cEvin Key while he was in the new wave band Images in Vogue, Skinny Puppy evolved into a full-time project with the addition of vocalist Nivek Ogre. Over the course of a dozen studio albums and many live tours, Key and Ogre have been the only constant members. Other members have included Dwayne Goettel (1986\u20131995), Dave \"Rave\" Ogilvie (long-time associate, producer, and \"unofficial\" fourth member until 1995), Mark Walk (2003\u2013present), and a number of guests, including Bill Leeb (1985\u20131986, under the pseudonym Wilhelm Schroeder), Al Jourgensen (1989), and many others. After the self-release of their first cassette in 1984, Skinny Puppy soon signed to Vancouver label Nettwerk, anchoring its early roster. From their Nettwerk debut EP Remission in 1984 to their 1992 album Last Rights, Skinny Puppy developed into an influential band with a dedicated cult following, fusing elements of ambient, noise, new wave, electro, and rock music and making innovative use of sampling. Over the course of several tours of North America and Europe in this period, they became known for theatrical, horror-themed live performances and videos, drawing attention to issues such as chemical warfare and animal testing. In 1993, Skinny Puppy left Nettwerk and long-time producer Rave, signing with American Recordings and relocating to Malibu, California, where drug problems and tension between band members plagued the recording of their next album, The Process. Ogre quit Skinny Puppy in June 1995, and Goettel died of a heroin overdose two months later. The album was completed with Rave and released in Goettel's memory in 1996. Key and Ogre, already active in a number of other projects, went their separate ways, reuniting for a one-off Skinny Puppy concert at the Doomsday Festival in Dresden, Germany, in 2000. Reforming Skinny Puppy in 2003 with Mark Walk, they have since released three albums on the German label Synthetic Symphony, and toured extensively."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"System 7 are a British ambient dance band. Due to the existence of another band called System Seven they were initially billed as 777 in North America. System 7 was the name of the current Macintosh Operating System at the time of the band's formation. Steve Hillage and Miquette Giraudy, both formerly of Gong, formed System 7 after hearing the likes of the Orb playing Hillage's 1979 ambient record Rainbow Dome Musick. They soon became part of the underground dance scene in London. While Hillage and Giraudy form the core of System 7, it is more of an extended collaborative project with artists such as Carl Craig, Laurent Garnier, Derrick May, Alex Paterson (of The Orb), and Youth. System 7 makes extensive use of Hillage's electric guitars. Hillage and Giraudy later launched a spin-off project called Mirror System, and have also worked under the name Groovy Intent."@en ;

The Angels were cited by Guns N' Roses and a number of Seattle grunge bands, including Pearl Jam and Nirvana, as having influenced their music. In the international market, to avoid legal problems with the Casablanca Records' act Angel, their records were released under the names Angel City and later The Angels from Angel City. Lead singer Doc Neeson who fronted the band from 1974-1999 left pre-Millenium due to spinal injuries sustained in a car accident. After spending most of the 2000s apart, in April 2008, the original 1970s line-up of The Angels reformed for a series of tours. In January 2013 it was announced that lead singer Doc Neeson had been diagnosed with a brain tumour and would undergo immediate treatment. Neeson died aged 67. It was also revealed that bassist Chris Bailey (1950\u20132013) had been battling an aggressive cancer.

Originally an alternative hip hop group, they subsequently added R&B and EDM influences. Although the group was founded in Los Angeles in 1995, it was not until the release of their third album Elephunk in 2003 that they achieved high record sales. Since that time, the group has sold an estimated 76 million records (35 million albums and 41 million singles), making them one of the world's best-selling groups of all time. According to Nielsen SoundScan, the Black Eyed Peas were the second-best-selling artist/group of all time for downloaded tracks, with over 42 million sales as of the end of 2011. Their first major hit was the 2003 single \"Where Is the Love?\" from Elephunk, which topped the charts in 13 countries, including the United Kingdom, where it spent seven weeks at number one and went on to become Britain's biggest selling single of 2003. Another European hit single from the album was \"Shut Up\". Their fourth album, Monkey Business, was an even bigger worldwide success, certified 4\u00D7 Platinum in the U.S., and spawning four singles, \"Don't Phunk with My Heart\", \"Don't Lie\", \"My Humps\" and \"Pump It\". In 2009, the group became one of only 11 artists to have simultaneously held the No. 1 and No. 2 spots on the Billboard Hot 100, with their singles \"Boom Boom Pow\" and \"I Gotta Feeling\", which topped the chart for an unprecedented 26 consecutive weeks. This album The E.N.D later produced a third Hot 100 number-one placement with \"Imma Be\", making the group one of few to ever place three number one singles on the chart from the same album, before being followed with \"Rock That Body\" and \"Meet Me Halfway\", which peaked in the Top 10 of the Hot 100. \"I Gotta Feeling\" became the first single to sell more than one million downloads in the United Kingdom. The Black Eyed Peas were ranked 12th on Billboard's Decade-End Chart Artist of the Decade, and 7th in the Hot 100 Artists of the Decade. At the 52nd Grammy Awards ceremony, held in January 2010, they won three awards out of six nominations. In November 2010, they released the album The Beginning. In February 2011, the group performed at the Super Bowl XLV halftime show.

During the course of their career the band released six full-length albums on the labels Hollywood Records and Side One Dummy Records. Though they experienced several lineup changes over the years, founding members Jason Navarro and Dan Lukacinsky remained regular fixtures. The band's musical style initially blended elements of punk rock, ska, and hardcore into a genre popularly known as ska punk or \"ska-core,\" which characterized their first two albums. During the middle of their career they shifted gears, moving away from this sound and producing two albums with a heavy pop rock influence. Their final two albums moved back towards their mid-1990s style, bringing back heavy ska punk and hardcore elements. Despite being signed to a major record label for their first four albums, The Suicide Machines did not experience significant mainstream success. However, they did achieve a relatively high level of underground recognition through relentless touring, including multiple performances on the Warped Tour. This trend continued when the band moved to an independent label for their last four years, before their breakup brought an abrupt end to the band's career."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"All Saints are an English-Canadian girl group formed in London in 1993. Originally founded as All Saints 1.9.7.5 by members Melanie Blatt, Shaznay Lewis and Simone Rainford, the group struggled to find commercial success upon being signed to ZTT Records and were dropped by the label shortly after Rainford left the group. In 1995 the group were joined by sisters Nicole and Natalie Appleton and signed to London Records under their shortened name. All Saints became one of the most popular groups of the 1990s; marketed as an alternative to the Spice Girls with their edgy take on pop music, and signature crop top and cargo pants style which prompted a late 1990s British fashion trend. The group's debut album, All Saints (1997), peaked at number two on the UK Albums Chart and went on to become the third best-selling girl group album of all time in the UK. The Appleton sisters' private lives soon became a staple feature among tabloid newspapers to the extent that it detracted from the group's music. All Saints' second album, Saints & Sinners (2000), became their first number-one album and achieved multi-platinum success. Amid in-fighting among the group members, All Saints controversially split the following year. The group later reformed after signing to Parlophone Records to release their third album, Studio 1 (2006). However, the album bowed at number 40 in the UK and All Saints were dropped by Parlophone shortly afterward. Following a second split in 2009, the group reunited in 2014 for a series of well received live performances, prompting the group to sign to London for a second time for the release of their fourth album, Red Flag (2016). In their career, All Saints achieved a string of nine consecutive top-ten hits in the UK, including five number-ones: \"Never Ever\", \"Under the Bridge\"/\"Lady Marmalade\", \"Bootie Call\", \"Pure Shores\" and \"Black Coffee\". \"Never Ever\" is the second best-selling girl group single of all-time in the UK, behind the Spice Girls' \"Wannabe\". The group have also won two Brit Awards, two MTV Europe Music Awards and one Ivor Novello Award. As of January 2016, All Saints have sold 12 million records."@en ;

The band consists of lead vocalist and guitarist Myles Kennedy, lead guitarist and backing vocalist Mark Tremonti, bassist Brian Marshall, and drummer Scott Phillips. Since the band's formation, there have been no line-up changes. The band is known for their acclaimed live shows and extensive touring support on all continents. Following Creed's disbandment in 2004, former members Tremonti, Marshall, and Phillips began working with Kennedy, formerly of The Mayfield Four. Named after a bridge that once existed on Alter Road near Tremonti's former home in Detroit, Michigan, Alter Bridge released its debut album, One Day Remains, the same year. Despite mixed reviews, One Day Remains went on to be certified Gold by the RIAA. Driven by the release of the single \"Rise Today\", the band released its second album, Blackbird, to more positive reviews in 2007, embarking on a successful world tour in support. Tremonti, Marshall, and Phillips reunited with Creed for a tour and album in 2009, while Kennedy recorded two songs for guitarist Slash's self-titled solo album in 2010, before fronting his band for a supporting tour. During this time, Alter Bridge continued to write material, and released its third album, AB III, in 2010 to critical acclaim, while the single \"Isolation\" became the band's most successful single to date. The band embarked on a world tour in support of AB III from 2010 to 2012. Following the conclusion of the AB III tour, the members of Alter Bridge focused on other musical endeavors throughout 2012, including solo and session work, another Creed tour, and Kennedy's continued collaborations with Slash. Alter Bridge reconvened in early 2013 and released its fourth album, Fortress, to further acclaim later that year, also embarking on a world tour, lasting until November 2014.

dbr:Bad_Religion	rdf:type	dbo:Band ;
	dbo:abstract	"Bad Religion is an American punk rock band that formed in Los Angeles, California in 1979. The band makes extensive use of soaring three-part vocal harmonies (which they refer to in their album liner notes as the \"oozin' aahs\"), guitar solos and lyrics that often contain religious and political commentary. Their lyrics often relate to matters of social responsibility. The band's lineup has changed several times over its lifespan, with lead vocalist Greg Graffin being the only consistent member; the current lineup, however, features three of the band's four original members (Graffin, Brett Gurewitz and Jay Bentley). To date, Bad Religion has released sixteen studio albums, two live albums, three compilation albums, three EPs (one of which is composed of covers of Christmas songs) and two DVDs (which were both recorded live). They are considered to be one of the best-selling punk rock acts of all time, having sold over 5 million albums worldwide. Bad Religion had built an underground following in the United States with their early albums before signing to Atlantic Records in 1993. They rose to fame that same year with their seventh studio album Recipe for Hate, which peaked at number 14 on Billboard's Heatseekers chart. Recipe for Hate was followed a year later by Stranger than Fiction, which spawned their biggest hits \"Infected\" and a re-recorded version of \"21st Century (Digital Boy)\", and was certified gold in both the United States and Canada. Shortly before the release of Stranger than Fiction, Gurewitz left Bad Religion to focus on his label Epitaph, and was replaced by Brian Baker. Since the return of Gurewitz in 2001, the band has undergone a resurgence in popularity, with their sixteenth studio album True North (2013) becoming Bad Religion's first album to crack the top 20 on the Billboard 200 chart, where it peaked at number 19. The band is expected to release their seventeenth studio album around 2017."@en ;

dbr:Blind_Guardian	rdf:type	dbo:Band ;
	dbo:abstract	"Blind Guardian is a German power metal band formed in the mid-1980s in Krefeld, West Germany. They are often credited as one of the seminal and most influential bands in the power metal and speed metal subgenres. Ten musicians have been a part of the band's line-up in its history, which has consisted of singer Hansi K\u00FCrsch, guitarists Andr\u00E9 Olbrich and Marcus Siepen, and drummer Frederik Ehmke since 2005. Blind Guardian is a part of the German heavy metal scene that emerged in the mid-1980s. The band was formed in 1984 as Lucifer's Heritage by K\u00FCrsch (then also bass guitarist), Olbrich, other guitarist Markus D\u00F6rk and drummer Thomas Stauch. D\u00F6rk and Stauch both left the following year, and were replaced by Christof Thei\u00DFen and Hans-Peter Frey respectively, who left as well before the end of the year. In 1987, Siepen joined and Stauch returned; under this line-up, which lasted 18 years (the longest in the band's history), the band changed their name to Blind Guardian and released their first album, Battalions of Fear, in 1988. Over the releases, Blind Guardian established themselves as a notable successful band and as pioneers of the power metal movement. In 1996, K\u00FCrsch stopped acting as the band's bass guitarist to focus on vocals. Various session members replaced him, mainly Oliver Holzwarth. However, in 2005, Stauch left the band, disapproving of Blind Guardian's transition into a more complex progressive sound with a heavy use of backing vocals, and was replaced by Ehmke. Most of Blind Guardian's albums were well received by fans and critics alike: Somewhere Far Beyond (1992), Imaginations from the Other Side (1995), and Nightfall in Middle-Earth (1998), are especially seen as influential works. The music is mostly composed by K\u00FCrsch and Olbrich together, and the lyrics, written by K\u00FCrsch, are mostly inspired by the fiction of fantasy authors such as J. R. R. Tolkien, Michael Moorcock, Robert Jordan, Stephen King and George R. R. Martin as well as traditional legends and epics. Over the years a theme has developed which personifies the band members as travelling storytellers, leading fans to refer to the band affectionately as \"The Bards\"."@en ;

It is characterized by a very large number of sounds, grand orchestrations featuring guitars, horns, woodwinds, and violins, unusual song structures, and an experimental, and sometimes chaotic production style from David Newfeld, who produced the second and third albums. In 2009, Stuart Berman's This Book Is Broken, which details the band from its inception to its critical acclaim, was published.

Their style mixes elements of pop, ska, punk rock, folk, alternative country, and world music. The band initially polarized audiences within the hardcore punk scene of California's Inland Empire before finding wider acceptance and, eventually, an international audience. Their strong iconoclasm and emphasis on do-it-yourself values proved influential to the burgeoning indie rock movement. The band's first three independent records were released within an 18-month period. Their debut single was \"Take the Skinheads Bowling\". The group signed to Virgin Records in 1987, released two albums and enjoyed chart success with their 1989 cover of Status Quo's \"Pictures of Matchstick Men\", a number one hit on Billboard Magazine's Modern Rock Tracks. They disbanded the following year due to internal tensions. Lead singer David Lowery formed Cracker, David Immergl\u00FCck joined the Counting Crows, and several other members played in Monks of Doom.

Following early line-ups with different guitarists and drummers, Liam \"Skin\" Tyson (guitar) and Keith O'Neill (drums) joined Cast in 1993. Emerging from the Britpop movement of the mid-1990s, Cast signed to Polydor Records and their debut album All Change (1995) became the highest selling debut album for the label. Further commercial success continued with the albums Mother Nature Calls (1997) and Magic Hour (1999), however a departure in sound on the band's fourth album Beetroot (2001) was met by a poor critical and commercial reaction and led to the band's split two weeks after its release. The band reformed in November 2010 and released their fifth album Troubled Times in November 2011. Bassist Peter Wilkinson confirmed his departure from the band in March 2015, following his abrupt departure from a previous tour in December 2014. Noel Gallagher of Oasis described watching the band live as being like a \"religious experience\" and they were labelled \"The Who of the 90's\". It has been suggested that the name \"Cast\" was taken from the final word on The La's eponymous album (the song \"Looking Glass\" ends with the repeated line \"The change is cast\"); John Power has since confirmed this to be true, stating that he avoided answering this question for some time."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Davenport (or The Davenport Family) was a musical collective from Madison, Wisconsin. The project was initiated by Clay Ruby in 2002. Their musical style, difficult to categorize, owes more to freeform jazz, psychedelic rock, and experimental avant-garde music than to traditional folk music, and may be loosely attributed to such genres as free folk, psych folk, freak-folk, acid folk, wyrd folk or New Weird America. The Davenport Family name existed actively until 2005. Presently, all original members participate in a similar band, which operates under the name Second Family Band. The recordings and performances typically include varying combinations of drums and other percussion, guitars, vocals, synthesizers, piano, organs, violins, flutes, electronics, sound sculpture, field recordings, more synths, sitar, sticks, rocks, and stones. Their music is almost always improvised, with a rare exception of overdubbing and other studio composed manipulations, especially in the early days of the group. The group is noted for usually shunning the recording studio, preferring field recording in locations such as barns, caves, or pastures. Consequently, environmental sounds such as dogs barking, birds singing, and other ambient noise may be heard on record."@en ;

The former Marduk drummer and vocalist Jocke Gothberg joined later on vocals, as well as Hans Nilsson (ex-Liers in Wait, Diabolique, Crystal Age) on drums. The band released Penetrations from the Lost World in 1997 before splitting up the following year. They reformed in 2000, and later recorded Silent Night Fever and This Is Hell. Tours have been rare due to members' other musical commitments. Musically, they have been described as strictly old-school Swedish death metal in the range of At the Gates, Unleashed and Defleshed. Because of Dimension Zero's inception by In Flames' lead guitarist, Jesper Str\u00F6mblad, their albums have drawn critical comparisons with some of In Flames' earlier work. Their latest album, He Who Shall Not Bleed, was released in 2007. In May 2014, it was announced that the band would reunite for the Gothenburg Sound Festival, which was set to take place in January 2015. In November 2014, a video message from vocalist Jocke on Gothenburg Sound's official Facobook page announced that Dimension Zero had been forced to cancel due to \"family circumstances\" and was replaced by Jesper Str\u00F6mblad's new band The Resistance.

	dbo:abstract	"Dream Theater is an American progressive metal band formed in 1985 under the name Majesty by John Petrucci, John Myung, and Mike Portnoy while they attended Berklee College of Music in Massachusetts. They subsequently dropped out of their studies to concentrate further on the band that would ultimately become Dream Theater. Though a number of lineup changes followed, the three original members remained together along with James LaBrie and Jordan Rudess until September 8, 2010 when Portnoy left the band. In October 2010, the band held auditions for a drummer to replace Portnoy. Mike Mangini was announced as the new permanent drummer on April 29, 2011. The band is well known for the technical proficiency of its instrumentalists, who have won many awards from music instruction magazines. Guitarist John Petrucci has been named as the third player on the G3 tour six times, more than any invited players. In 2009 he was named the No. 2 best metal guitarist by Joel McIver in his book The 100 Greatest Metal Guitarists. He was also named as one of the \"Top 10 Fastest Shredders of All Time\" by GuitarOne magazine. Jordan Rudess is considered to be one of the greatest keyboard players of all time by many publications like MusicRadar. Former drummer Mike Portnoy has won 26 awards from Modern Drummer magazine and is also the second youngest person (at the age of 37) to be inducted into the Rock Drummer Hall of Fame. His replacement Mike Mangini has also previously set 5 WFD records. John Myung was voted the greatest bassist of all time in a poll conducted by MusicRadar in August through September 2010. The band was inducted into the Long Island Music Hall of Fame in 2010. The band's highest-selling album is the gold-selling Images and Words (1992), which reached No. 61 on the Billboard 200 chart. Both the 1994 release Awake and their 2002 release Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence also entered the charts at No. 32 and No. 46 respectively and received mostly positive reviews. Metropolis Pt. 2: Scenes from a Memory was ranked number 95 on the October 2006 issue of Guitar World magazine's list of The greatest 100 guitar albums of all time. It is ranked as the 15th Greatest Concept Album (as of March 2003) by Classic Rock Magazine and as the number one all-time progressive album by Rolling Stone (as of July 2012). Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence also led to Dream Theater becoming the initial band reviewed in the music section of Entertainment Weekly during its opening week of release, despite the magazine generally preferring more mainstream music. The band's eleventh studio album, A Dramatic Turn of Events, was released on September 13, 2011. On November 30, 2011, the album's lead single, \"On the Backs of Angels\", was nominated for a Grammy Award in the \"Best Hard Rock/Metal Performance\" category, marking the band's first ever Grammy nomination. Dream Theater's self-titled twelfth studio album was released on September 23, 2013 and earned their second Grammy Award nomination, this time for \u201CBest Metal Performance\u201D, for the album's first single, \"The Enemy Inside\". On April 9, 2013, Images and Words won Loudwire's fan voted March Metal Madness for world's best metal album beating albums by Dio, AC/DC, Judas Priest, Megadeth and Metallica. As of 2011, Dream Theater has sold over 12 million records worldwide."@en ;

dbr:Foo_Fighters	rdf:type	dbo:Band ;
	dbo:abstract	"Foo Fighters is an American rock band, formed in Seattle in 1994. It was founded by Nirvana drummer Dave Grohl as a one-man project following the death of Kurt Cobain and the resulting dissolution of his previous band. The group got its name from the UFOs and various aerial phenomena that were reported by Allied aircraft pilots in World War II, which were known collectively as foo fighters. Prior to the release of Foo Fighters' 1995 debut album Foo Fighters, which featured Grohl as the only official member, Grohl recruited bassist Nate Mendel and drummer William Goldsmith, both formerly of Sunny Day Real Estate, as well as Nirvana touring guitarist Pat Smear to complete the lineup. The band began with performances in Portland, Oregon. Goldsmith quit during the recording of the group's second album, The Colour and the Shape (1997), when most of the drum parts were re-recorded by Grohl himself. Smear's departure followed soon afterward. They were replaced by Taylor Hawkins and Franz Stahl, respectively, although Stahl was fired before the recording of the group's third album, There Is Nothing Left to Lose (1999). The band briefly continued as a trio until Chris Shiflett joined as the band's lead guitarist after the completion of There Is Nothing Left to Lose. The band released its fourth album, One by One, in 2002. The group followed that release with the two-disc In Your Honor (2005), which was split between acoustic songs and heavier material. Foo Fighters released its sixth album, Echoes, Silence, Patience & Grace, in 2007. In 2010, it was confirmed that Smear had officially rejoined the band after having toured with Foo Fighters as an unofficial member since 2005. The band's seventh studio album, Wasting Light, produced by Butch Vig was released in 2011, in which Smear returned as a full member. In November 2014, the band's eighth studio album, Sonic Highways, was released as an accompanying soundtrack to the Grohl-directed 2014 miniseries of the same name. Over the course of the band's career, four of its albums have won Grammy Awards for Best Rock Album. As of 2015 the band's eight albums have sold 12 million copies in the U.S. alone."@en ;

The band's line-up comprises lead vocalist Matthew Davies-Kreye, guitarist Kris Coombs-Roberts, guitarist Gavin Burrough and bassist Richard Boucher. Funeral for a Friend's popularity rose in the United Kingdom with the release of their debut album, Casually Dressed & Deep in Conversation (2003). Achieving both a gold certification and three top twenty singles in their home country, Casually Dressed & Deep in Conversation is often acclaimed as one of the landmark emo records of the 2000s. Hours (2005) and Tales Don't Tell Themselves (2007) showed an evolution in Funeral for a Friend's musical style from the style which defined their debut, as the group began to diverge from their use of screaming vocals, post-hardcore influenced guitars, favouring more melodic emo influences. These albums achieved gold and silver sales certificates respectively in the UK. Funeral for a Friend self-released their fourth album, Memory and Humanity (2008) through their short-lived record label Join Us, the album arguably being their most eclectic to date. Following this the band tied themselves to other independent labels for Welcome Home Armageddon (2011) Conduit (2013), and Chapter and Verse (2015), which showed the band returning to the metal and hardcore influenced style of their earlier work. In September 2015 they announced that they will do a final tour and break up in 2016."@en ;

The band originally called themselves Hoover, but later changed their name to Hooverphonic after discovering other groups were already using the Hoover name and to avoid any legal issues with the vacuum cleaner company. On 10 October 2008, Geike Arnaert, the lead singer of the band, announced she would leave the group by the end of the year to pursue her solo career.

	dbo:abstract	"Icehouse is an Australian rock band, formed as Flowers in 1977 in Sydney. Initially known in Australia for their pub rock style, they later achieved mainstream success playing new wave and synthpop music and attained Top 10 singles chart success in both Europe and the U.S. The mainstay of both Flowers and Icehouse has been Iva Davies (singer-songwriter, record producer, guitar, bass, keyboards, oboe) supplying additional musicians as required. The name Icehouse, which was adopted in 1981, comes from an old, cold flat Davies lived in and the strange building across the road populated by itinerant people. Davies and Icehouse extended the use of synthesizers particularly the Sequential Circuits Prophet-5 (\"Love in Motion\", 1981), Linn drum machine (\"Hey Little Girl\", 1982) and Fairlight CMI (Razorback trailer, 1983) in Australian popular music. Their best known singles on the Australian charts were \"Great Southern Land\", \"Hey Little Girl\", \"Crazy\", \"Electric Blue\" and \"My Obsession\"; with Top Three albums being Icehouse (1980, as Flowers), Primitive Man (1982) and Man of Colours (1987). Icehouse's iconic status was acknowledged when they were inducted into the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) Hall of Fame on 16 August 2006.

The current lineup of the band comprises Flynn, drummer Dave McClain, guitarist Phil Demmel, and bassist Jared MacEachern. Machine Head is one of the pioneering bands in the New Wave of American Heavy Metal. Machine Head was formed by member Robb Flynn, previously part of the bands Forbidden and Vio-lence. Flynn felt musically unfulfilled with Vio-lence and requested to start a side project. When his request was denied, he left the band and formed Machine Head in 1991 with Adam Duce, Logan Mader and Tony Constanza. The band's first album Burn My Eyes, was a big success in Europe where it garnered attention on MTV's Headbangers Ball. In America (with HBB taken off the air during the grunge movement) Machine Head would not have success until later albums. The band nearly disbanded in 2002 after negotiating off its label Roadrunner Records, when controversy surrounding Machine Head's fourth album Supercharger (released 3 weeks after September 11, 2001) resulted in their songs and music video for the song \"Crashing Around You\" (which featured burning buildings) being pulled from all media outlets. The band re-signed with Roadrunner soon after and has released four albums since, 2003's Through the Ashes of Empires, 2007's The Blackening (which earned Machine Head its first Grammy Award nomination) and 2011's Unto the Locust.

Their early combination of androgynous glam imagery, critical social lyrics about \"culture, alienation, boredom and despair\" and a furious rock sound gained them a loyal following over the years and assured them a cult status. The band's later albums retained a leftist politicisation and intellectual lyrical style while adopting a broader alternative rock sound. To date, they have sold more than 10 million albums worldwide. Over their career the Manics have headlined several festivals including Glastonbury, T in the Park, V Festival and Reading. They have won eleven NME Awards, eight Q Awards and four BRIT Awards. The Manics were also nominated for the Mercury Prize in 1996 and 1999, and have had one nomination for the MTV Europe Music Awards. The group has reached number 1 in the UK charts three times: in 1998 with the album This Is My Truth Tell Me Yours, and the single \"If You Tolerate This Your Children Will Be Next\" and again in 2000 with the single \"The Masses Against the Classes\"."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Master is a death metal band formed in Chicago, USA in 1983 as the band Warcry fell apart. However, the band was put on hold due to internal problems shortly after its inception. Paul Speckmann then formed the band Death Strike, which in 1985 he renamed to Master. In 1985 Master obtained a record deal with Combat Records and recorded an album, which was not released until 2003 by Displeased Records as Unreleased 1985 album. In 1990 the band was signed by the German label Nuclear Blast Records, who also had contracted Speckmann's other band Abomination. The actual debut album of Master, titled simply Master, was recorded twice; first with Mittelbrun on guitars and Schmidt on drums. This recording was not accepted by the record company Nuclear Blast. Hence it was re-recorded with Nickeas (drums) and Martinelli (guitar), which was eventually released as the Speckmann Project in 1991. The first recording was released under the name Master in 1990. In 1991, the second album was released: On the Seventh Day God Created ... Master, featuring Paul Masvidal on lead guitar, followed by the Collection of Souls in 1993 both on Nuclear Blast. Thereafter their record deal ended and Master went on hiatus to find a new record label. Five years layer, Faith Is in Season was released on Pavement Music. Speckmann then focused on several other projects, including the resurrected Abomination and eventually joined the Czech band Krabathor, for which Speckmann relocated to the Czech Republic. In 2002 the next album was released, titled Let's Start a War on System Shock, which also contracted Krabathor. In 2004 Spirit of the West followed. Master then switched labels again, to the German label Twilight Vertrieb and released Four More Years of Terror in 2005. The album Slaves to Society was released in May 2007. The band embarked on a European tour in May and June 2007, followed by yet another tour with Chicago legend Lividity beginning on September 8, 2007 until September 30, 2007. Slaves to Society has been re-released on Ibex Moon Records in Pennsylvania in September 2008. The spring of 2009 found the band touring successfully for 38 days playing 30 shows across the European continent. The US version of Master toured in July 2009 for 21 shows in America."@en ;

The group recorded mostly as a quintet. During the group's first bout of fame in 1983, its members were Ricky Bell, Michael Bivins, Bobby Brown, Ronnie DeVoe, and Ralph Tresvant. Early hits included \"Candy Girl,\" \"Cool It Now\" and \"Mr. Telephone Man\". Brown was voted out of the group in 1985 and embarked on a solo career. The group continued for a time with its remaining four members, but eventually recruited singer Johnny Gill, who would be introduced on their 1988 album Heart Break. The group went on hiatus in 1990, while its various members worked on side projects, such as the group Bell Biv DeVoe. Gill and Tresvant also recorded successful solo albums. All six members of New Edition reunited in 1996 to record the group's sixth studio album Home Again. During the ill-fated Home Again Tour, both Bobby Brown and Michael Bivins eventually quit the group, forcing the remainder of the tour to be canceled. Various reunions have occurred since, usually with the 1987-1990 lineup, though occasionally also including Brown. Their last studio album was 2004's One Love. As of 2010, two New Edition descendants were recording and touring: Bell Biv DeVoe and Heads of State (which features Brown, Tresvant and Gill.)

While steadily eschewing pop star status, the band cultivated a fanbase in the United Kingdom from 1978\u20131980. They gained popularity throughout Europe with the 1980 single \"Enola Gay\", and achieved broader recognition via album Architecture & Morality (1981) and its singles. OMD garnered acclaim for their experimental recordings, which are noted for their intellectual depth. Although retrospectively lauded, the challenging Dazzle Ships (1983) eroded European consumer interest during the mid 1980s; Junk Culture (1984) marked a shift toward more pop-oriented songwriting. Concurrently, OMD reached their peak in the United States and had a major hit with 1986's \"If You Leave\", written for the film Pretty in Pink. Humphreys departed in 1989 with Martin Cooper (various instruments) and Malcolm Holmes (drums) to form The Listening Pool, leaving McCluskey to lead the outfit; Sugar Tax (1991) and its initial singles were sizeable hits in Europe. By the mid 1990s, however, synthpop had become unfashionable amid the guitar oriented musical climate, and McCluskey dissolved the band in 1996, months after their last successful single, \"Walking on the Milky Way\". He founded pop group Atomic Kitten in 1998. The band reformed in 2006 and began releasing new material in 2009. Their European fanbase remained steadfast: History of Modern (2010) became the group's biggest hit on the German chart; English Electric (2013) their largest in the UK since Sugar Tax. The group have sold over 40 million records. With a within popular music, OMD have influenced many modern acts. Their songs have been covered or remixed by numerous artists, and the group are the subject of two tribute albums. Regarding the group's impact on synthpop, The Scotsman wrote that \"Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark were its Beatles\"; McCluskey and Humphreys have been labelled by numerous critics as the genre's counterpart of Lennon\u2013McCartney."@en ;

The name Pentangle was chosen to represent the five members of the band, and is also the device on Sir Gawain's shield in the Middle English poem Sir Gawain and the Green Knight which held a fascination for Renbourn. In 2007, the original members of the band were reunited to receive a Lifetime Achievement award at the BBC Radio 2 Folk Awards and to record a short concert that was broadcast on BBC radio. In June 2008, the band, comprising all five original members, embarked on a twelve-date UK tour."@en ;

dbr:Porcupine_Tree	rdf:type	dbo:Band ;
	dbo:abstract	"Porcupine Tree are an English rock band formed by musician Steven Wilson in 1987. The band began essentially as a solo project for Wilson, who created all of the band's music. However, by 1993, Wilson desired to work in a band environment, and so brought on frequent collaborators Richard Barbieri on keyboards, Colin Edwin on bass and Chris Maitland on drums as permanent band members. With Wilson still in charge of guitar and lead vocals, this would remain the lineup until 2001, when the band recruited Gavin Harrison to replace Maitland on drums. Porcupine Tree's early sound evokes a style of psychedelic rock comparable to that of progressive rock band Pink Floyd. Upon signing with Kscope record label in the late 1990s, the band approached a more mainstream alternative rock sound. By the early 2000s, the band signed to a major record label and shifted their sound again, this time in a more progressive metal direction. After the release and tour in support of their tenth studio album, The Incident, the band became inactive as Wilson began to focus on his solo career. While not formally broken up, they also have no particular reformation plans beyond \"someday\", with members all working on separate projects, and Wilson committing himself to his solo work through most of 2015."@en ;

Heavily influenced by 1960s girl groups, pop bands, The Beach Boys, and early punk rock bands, such as the Ramones, the trio crafts stripped-down songs with simplistic lyrics sung both in Japanese and English. Despite their pop-oriented nature, the trio maintains a distinctly underground garage rock sound rooted in edgy instrumentation and D.I.Y. aesthetics, which over the course of their long career has earned them a solid, worldwide cult following and made avid fans out of seminal '90s alternative rock bands such as Sonic Youth, Nirvana, and Redd Kross. The band has been credited with making \"the international pop underground more international\" by \"opening it up to bands from Japan\".

While three of those bands (except Tankard) created a sound that would influence death metal and black metal, Sodom's early music style would greatly influence many late-1980s and early-1990s black metal bands more than others. To date, Sodom has released fourteen studio albums, three live albums, two compilation albums and six EPs. They achieved their first commercial success with their third studio album Agent Orange (1989), which was the first thrash metal album to enter the German album charts, where it reached number 36. Sodom remains one of the best-selling thrash metal acts of all time, having sold over one million records."@en ;

Show, starring Rob Reiner. The sketch, actually a mock promotional video for the song \"Rock and Roll Nightmare\", was written by Reiner and the band, and included songwriter/performer Loudon Wainwright III on keyboards. Later the band became the fictional subject of the 1984 rockumentary/mockumentary film This Is Spinal Tap. The band members are portrayed by Michael McKean (as David St. Hubbins), Christopher Guest (as Nigel Tufnel) and Harry Shearer (as Derek Smalls). This Is Spinal Tap was accompanied by a soundtrack album of the same name. In the years following the film's release, the actors have portrayed the band members at concerts and released music under the Spinal Tap name. Guest, McKean, and Shearer toured in the United States in April and May 2009 and performed as Spinal Tap in a \"One Night Only World Tour\" on June 30, 2009 at Wembley Arena in London, three days after playing the Glastonbury Festival. Support at Wembley Arena came from the same trio's fictitious folk music band The Folksmen."@en ;

The band was initially formed by four college students\u2014Bilal Maqsood (vocals and guitars), Faisal Kapadia (vocals), Rafiq Wazir Ali (synthesizer) and Kareem Bashir Bhoy (bass guitar)\u2014in 1988. In 1992 the quartet disbanded, only to make a comeback with Maqsood and Kapadia in 2000. While the initial band rode the new wave of Pakistani pop music, the later lineup ushered in a revival in the Pakistani music industry. In 1990 the band signed with EMI Records and released their debut album, Strings. Their initial experiments with synthesised sounds and rhythms was not immediately recognised, although Strings sold 20,000 copies during its first week after release. Two years later the band released their second album, 2, which included the critically acclaimed single \"Sar Kiye Yeh Pahar\". The song was first aired on MTV Asia, and led the band to widespread fame. After the release of 2, the quartet disbanded to focus on their studies and careers. In 2000 Maqsood and Kapadia released Duur, which revived the band's popularity, and followed it with Dhaani in 2003. This album included the single \"Najane Kyun\", which was part of the soundtrack for the Hollywood film Spider-Man 2. Following Junoon and Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan, Strings went to India (where they found remixes of one of their early songs playing in clubs). In 2008 Strings released their fifth album, Koi Aanay Wala Hai, with the singles \"Zinda\" and \"Aakhri Alvida\" (included on the soundtracks for Bollywood's Zinda and Shootout at Lokhandwala). The album was co-produced by Bollywood actor John Abraham, and was successful in Pakistan and India. Strings are acclaimed for their stringed rhythms and melodious, poetic songs written by Anwar Maqsood, Bilal's father. He has been writing lyrics for the band since its re-formation, with Kapadia the lead vocalist. Bilal Maqsood composes, plays guitar and occasionally sings. Strings' live performances are augmented by Adeel Ali on lead guitar, Shakir Khan on bass guitar, Haider Ali on keyboards and Aahad Nayani on drums. The band have sold over 25 million albums worldwide. In April 2013 Strings joined Meesha Shafi, Ali Azmat, Shahzad Hasan and Alamgir as judges on the vocal-talent show Cornetto Music Icons, aired on ARY Digital. Strings is also the director and producer of the Coke Studio Pakistan (Season 7) and Coke Studio Pakistan (Season 8)"@en ;

The band is often credited (along with D.R.I.) as one of \"the fathers of crossover thrash\". To date, Suicidal Tendencies have released nine studio albums, one EP, four split albums including the rare Welcome to Venice, six compilation albums (one of which is a \"double-EP\", while the other is a re-recording of their debut album), and two long-form videos. Suicidal Tendencies rose to fame with their 1983 self-titled debut album, which spawned the single \"Institutionalized\", and was one of the first hardcore punk videos to receive substantial airplay on MTV. Suicidal Tendencies' next release was on their own label, Suicidal Records, where they contributed one song, \"Look Up...(The Boys Are Back)\", on the 1985 split Welcome to Venice. After releasing their second album Join the Army (1987), Suicidal Tendencies were signed to Epic Records in 1988, and continued their success with their next three albums, How Will I Laugh Tomorrow When I Can't Even Smile Today (1988), Controlled by Hatred/Feel Like Shit...D\u00E9j\u00E0 Vu (1989) and Lights...Camera...Revolution! (1990); the latter of the two were certified Gold by the RIAA. Their 1992 follow-up album The Art of Rebellion was also very successful, and included two of their biggest hits \"Nobody Hears\" and \"I'll Hate You Better\". After releasing two more studio albums (Still Cyco After All These Years and Suicidal for Life), the band broke up and severed ties from Sony and Epic in 1995. However, they reunited a year later and have continued to perform and record since then. After over a decade of work and many lineup changes, Suicidal Tendencies released their eleventh studio album with all-new material, 13, in 2013. The band has been in talks of releasing a follow-up album in the future."@en ;

The duo was managed by Russian television producer Ivan Shapovalov while in the group Neposedi. The duo was signed to their own production company, T.A. Music, following the split with Universal Music Russia, and their sub-labels Interscope Records and Neformat. The duo established their success with their debut single \"All the Things She Said\", which gained acclaim from music journalists and critics. The video of the single, however, generated controversy worldwide, showing the girls kissing in the rain in school uniforms. Along with the number-one single, the following songs \"Not Gonna Get Us\" and \"All About Us\" gained success and also charted at No. 1 on other contemporary music charts. The duo has released six studio albums; three in Russian and three in English. The album 200 km/h in the Wrong Lane achieved huge success worldwide and eventually became the first group ever to get the IFPI Europe platinum award for the same album in two different languages. Due to their success, the duo was recognized as one of the most successful female music acts to emerge in the early decade and have established themselves as the most successful Russian act to date. t.A.T.u. represented Russia in the 2003 Eurovision Song Contest, performing \"Ne Ver', Ne Boysia\", finishing in third place. In March 2011, the duo officially announced their separation, due to personal reasons and conflicts between them and embarked on solo careers, which started around the end of 2008. As of 2012, t.A.T.u. have sold over 25 million records, and both the Russian and English version of 200 Km/h are listed among the best-selling albums by a girl group. They reunited in late December 2012 for a concert and announced their comeback after their performance in the opening ceremony of the Olympics in Sochi 2014. However, due to personal issues between Volkova and Katina, the duo announced that their project would only consist of their newest single and music video, \"Lyubov' V Kazhdom Mgnovenii\" (\"Love In Every Moment\") to promote a Russian short film which premiered at the 67th Cannes Film Festival."@en ;

The band's members are Adam Lazzara (lead vocals), John Nolan (guitar, vocals), Eddie Reyes (guitar), Shaun Cooper (bass guitar) and Mark O'Connell (drums). The band has released three studio albums with various past members Fred Mascherino (former lead guitarist and back-up vocalist), Matthew Rubano (former bassist), and Matthew Fazzi (former lead guitarist and back-up vocalist). The original Tell All Your Friends line-up reunited in 2010 and has released two studio albums: Taking Back Sunday and their most recent album Happiness Is. Louder Now (2006) was the band's breakout mainstream album, notably because of the popularity of its lead single \"MakeDamnSure.\" The album has sold over 900,000 copies and peaked at No. 2 on the United States Billboard 200, surpassing the band's previous Billboard 200 peak in 2004 at No. 3 with Where You Want to Be. Before the release of their first studio album Tell All Your Friends (2002), they released Taking Back Sunday's EP in 2001, when the band featured former lead vocalist Antonio Longo. At that time, the EP received very little attention, eventually resulting in the band seeking a new lead singer, Adam Lazzara. Lazzara had at first joined the band as its guitarist, left a few months after it formed, then replaced original bassist Jesse Lacey (now of Brand New) during the EP's recording sessions. John Nolan and Shaun Cooper left the band in 2003 only to rejoin in 2010, in time for the band's release of their eponymous album Taking Back Sunday on June 28, 2011. The album was produced by Eric Valentine and released through Warner Bros. Records. In 2014, the band released their sixth studio album Happiness Is to positive reviews. The album reached number 10 on the Billboard US charts."@en ;

dbr:The_Chieftains	rdf:type	dbo:Band ;
	dbo:abstract	"The Chieftains are a traditional Irish band formed in Dublin in November 1962, by Paddy Moloney, Sean Potts and Michael Tubridy. The band had their first rehearsals at Moloney's house, with Tubridy, Martin Fay and David Fallon. Their sound, which is almost entirely instrumental and largely built around uilleann pipes, has become synonymous with traditional Irish music and they are regarded as having helped popularise Irish music across the world. Paddy Moloney came out of Ceolt\u00F3ir\u00ED Chualann, a group of musicians who specialised in instrumentals, and sought to form a new band. The group remained only semi-professional up until the 1970s and by then had achieved great success in Ireland and the United Kingdom. In 1973, their popularity began to spread to the United States when their previous albums were released there by Island Records. They received further acclaim when they worked on the Academy Award-winning soundtrack to Stanley Kubrick's 1975 film Barry Lyndon, which triggered their transition to the mainstream in the US. The group continued to release successful records throughout the 1970s and 1980s, and their work with Van Morrison in 1988 resulted in the critically acclaimed album Irish Heartbeat. They went on to collaborate with many other well-known musicians and singers; among them Luciano Pavarotti, the Rolling Stones, Madonna, Sin\u00E9ad O'Connor and Roger Daltrey. The band have won six Grammys during their career and they were given a Lifetime Achievement Award at the prestigious BBC Radio 2 Folk Awards in 2002. Some music experts have credited The Chieftains with bringing traditional Irish music to a worldwide audience, so much so that the Irish government awarded them the honorary title of 'Ireland's Musical Ambassadors' in 1989. In 2012, they celebrated their 50th anniversary with the release of their most recent record Voice of Ages."@en ;

Instrumentally, their sound contains lush, multi-layered, psychedelic rock arrangements, but lyrically their compositions show elements of space rock, including unusual song and album titles\u2014such as \"What Is the Light? (An Untested Hypothesis Suggesting That the Chemical [In Our Brains] by Which We Are Able to Experience the Sensation of Being in Love Is the Same Chemical That Caused the \"Big Bang\" That Was the Birth of the Accelerating Universe)\". They are also acclaimed for their elaborate live shows, which feature costumes, balloons, puppets, video projections, complex stage light configurations, giant hands, large amounts of confetti, and frontman Wayne Coyne's signature man-sized plastic bubble, in which he traverses the audience. In 2002, Q magazine named the Flaming Lips one of the \"50 Bands to See Before You Die.\" The band is best known for its associations with 1960s and 1970s psychedelic subculture, with elements of this culture permeating the group's instrumentation, effects, and composition. Coyne's lyrics, in particular, both reference and embody the fascination with the science fiction and space opera genres of fiction that were popular during the golden age of psychedelic subculture. His lyrical style tends to use the imagery and plot conventions of space opera to frame more abstract themes about the unfolding cycles of romantic love, highlighting its vulnerability while delving into its metaphysical implications. The group recorded several albums and EPs on an indie label, Restless, in the 1980s and early 1990s. After signing to Warner Brothers, they scored a hit in 1993 with \"She Don't Use Jelly\". Although it has been their only hit single in the U.S., the band has maintained critical respect and, to a lesser extent, commercial viability through albums such as 1999's The Soft Bulletin (which was NME magazine's Album of the Year) and 2002's Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots. They have had more hit singles in the UK and Europe than in the U.S. In February 2007, they were nominated for a 2007 BRIT Award in the \"Best International Act\" category. By 2007, the group garnered three Grammy Awards, including two for Best Rock Instrumental Performance."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"The Kooks are a British rock band formed in Brighton, East Sussex, in 2004. The band currently consists of Luke Pritchard (vocals/guitar), Hugh Harris (lead guitar/synth), Alexis Nunez (drums), and Peter Denton (bass guitar). The original bassist was Max Rafferty. The lineup of the band remained constant until the departure of Rafferty in 2008. Dan Logan served as a temporary replacement, until Peter Denton joined the band permanently in October 2008. Early in 2010, Pritchard announced the departure of drummer Paul Garred, due to a nerve problem in his arm. Late in the year, Garred rejoined for studio sessions, however Chris Prendergast played drums when the band played live. In 2012, the band was accompanied on drums by Alexis Nunez (from Golden Silvers), who eventually joined the band full-time. A self-described \"pop\" band, their music is primarily influenced by the 1960s British Invasion movement and post-punk revival of the new millennium. With songs described as \"catchy as hell\", The Kooks have experimented in several genres including rock, Britpop, pop, reggae, ska, and more recently, funk and hip-hop, being described once as a \"more energetic Thrills or a looser Sam Roberts Band, maybe even a less severe Arctic Monkeys at times\". Signed to Virgin Records just three months after forming, The Kooks broke into the musical mainstream with their debut album Inside In/Inside Out (2006). The album was ultimately successful, achieving quadruple platinum status in the UK within a year and also overseas in the form of a platinum certification in Australia and two times platinum in Ireland. The Kooks found themselves entering into mainstream media attention, with the band winning the award for Best UK & Ireland Act at the MTV Europe Music Awards 2006 and picking up a nomination at The Brit Awards for the single \"She Moves in Her Own Way\". With their follow-up Konk (2008) debuting at number one on the UK Albums Chart, it recorded first week sales of 65,000, achieving gold status in both the UK and Ireland. Their third studio album, entitled Junk of the Heart, was released on 12 September 2011. Their most recent album was released on 8 September 2014 and debuted at No. 16 on the UK Albums Chart."@en ;

The band name originates from the Thompson submachine gun, a nickname given to Perkovi\u0107 while he fought in the Croatian War of Independence. Although predominantly formed in \u010Cavoglave, Thompson is currently based in Zagreb. Thompson came to prominence during the Croatian war in 1991, with the release of the first single \"Bojna \u010Cavoglave\", which proclaims the Croatian resistance to Yugoslavia and was included in the compilation album Rock za Hrvatsku. This song, with slightly modified lyrics, named \"Branitelji Sarajeva\", was sung by the BiH Army during the Siege of Sarajevo (Sarajevo zaboravit ne \u0107e nikada). During the 1990s Thompson gained popularity in Croatia with the release of the first album Moli mala in 1992. They later regained popularity with the popular hit \"Prijatelji\" in 1998.[citation needed] In 2002, Thompson began their first major tour to promote the album E, moj narode. This tour continued sporadically until 2005, and included concerts at the Sydney Entertainment Centre and Melbourne's Vodafone Arena. In May 2005, the album was declared a Diamond Record with more than 60,000 copies sold. Touring continued in 2006 with Bilo jednom u Hrvatskoj, again performing internationally with concerts in Germany, Sweden, Australia, Canada, and the United States. Thompson features annually at the Homeland Victory celebrations in their hometown of \u010Cavoglave. These performances are attended by as many as 60,000 to 100,000 spectators, and feature Croatian singers like Mate Buli\u0107, Dra\u017Een Ze\u010Di\u0107, Ivan Mikuli\u0107, and Baruni.

	dbo:abstract	"Gong is a Franco-British progressive rock band known for incorporating elements of jazz and classical music into its musical style. The group was formed by Australian musician Daevid Allen in 1967. Notable band members have included Tim Blake, Didier Malherbe, Pip Pyle, Gilli Smyth, Steve Hillage, Francis Moze, Mike Howlett and Pierre Moerlen. Others who have played in Gong include Bill Bruford, Brian Davison, Don Cherry and Chris Cutler. Gong released its debut album, Magick Brother, in 1970, which featured a psychedelic pop sound. The following year, Gong released its second album, Camembert Electrique which featured a psychedelic rock sound. Between 1973 and 1974, Gong released the \"Flying Teapot Trilogy\", a series of progressive rock concept albums consisting of Flying Teapot, Angel's Egg and You, describing the adventures of Zero the Hero, the Good Witch Yoni and the Pot Head Pixies from the Planet Gong, who are green with propellers on their heads, and fly around in teapots. In 1976, Daevid Allen departed from the band, which released the album Shamal without him, and then released a series of jazz rock albums under the leadership of Pierre Moerlen. This incarnation of the band is known as Pierre Moerlen's Gong, and Gong member Gilli Smyth formed Mother Gong. Allen subsequently participated in a series of spin-off groups, including New York Gong and Gongmaison, before returning to lead Gong in 1991, releasing the albums Shapeshifter, Zero to Infinity, Acid Motherhood, 2032 and I See You before Allen's death in 2015."@en ;

The group's personnel has changed frequently over the years; Lydon has been the sole constant member. Lydon emerged after the break-up of the Sex Pistols with PiL's Public Image: First Issue (1978). The new band had a more experimental sound than the Pistols: a \"droning, slow-tempo, bass-heavy noise rock, overlaid by Lydon's distinctive, vituperative rant\". Their early work is often regarded as some of the most challenging and innovative music of the post-punk era. Their 1979 album Metal Box was ranked number 469 on Rolling Stone magazine's 2003 list of the 500 greatest albums of all time. The NME described PiL as \"arguably the first post-rock group\"."@en ;

Neal played keyboards and was the lead vocalist, as well as being the primary songwriter before leaving the band in 2002 to pursue a solo career. Alan plays electric guitar. The original line-up consisted of the Morse brothers, along with fellow musicians Nick D'Virgilio and John Ballard (bass). The following year Ballard was replaced by Dave Meros and the band subsequently released their debut album, The Light, in 1995. The quartet were later joined by veteran keyboardist Ryo Okumoto. Neal Morse departed in 2002, with D'Virgilio taking over lead vocals until his departure in 2011. The band currently consists of longstanding members Alan Morse, Dave Meros, and Ryo Okumoto, along with newer members drummer Jimmy Keegan and vocalist Ted Leonard; both of whom had performed in a live capacity with the band previously (Keegan from D'Virgilio's switch to frontman and Leonard in the immediate aftermath of D'Virgilio's departure). The band plays a brand of progressive rock with pop music leanings (drawing much influence from Yes and Genesis). The band is also well known for their intricate multi-part vocal harmonies (such as those found on certain Gentle Giant songs) and use of counterpoint on cuts such as \"Gibberish\", \"Thoughts (Parts I and II)\", \"A Guy Named Sid Pt.5: Sid's Boy Choir\", \"Long Time Suffering\", \"Devil's Got My Throat\", \"The Healing Colors of Sound, Pt. 2\", and \"Afterthoughts.\""@en ;

dbr:Stereolab	rdf:type	dbo:Band ;
	dbo:abstract	"Stereolab are an alternative music band formed in 1990 in London, England. The band originally comprised songwriting team Tim Gane (guitar/keyboards) and L\u00E6titia Sadier (vocals/keyboards/guitar), both of whom remained at the helm across many lineup changes. Other long-time members include Mary Hansen (backing vocals/keyboards/guitar), who played with the group from 1992 until her accidental death in 2002, and Andy Ramsay (drums), who joined in 1993, and who is still in the official line-up. Called \"one of the most fiercely independent and original groups of the Nineties\", Stereolab were one of the first bands to be termed \"post-rock\". Their primary musical influence was 1970s krautrock, which they combined with lounge, 1960s pop, and experimental pop music. They were noted for their heavy use of vintage electronic keyboards, and their sound often overlays a repetitive \"motorik\" beat with female vocals sung in English or French. Stereolab often incorporates socio-political themes into their lyrics. Some critics say the group's lyrics carry a strong Marxist message, and both Gane and Sadier admit to being influenced by the Surrealist and Situationist cultural and political movements. Gane is skeptical of labels such as \"Marxist pop\", and defends the band against accusations of \"sloganeering\". Although many of the band's albums have been underground hits, they never found larger commercial success. The band were released from their recording contract with Warner Bros. Records when Warner's imprint Elektra Records folded. The release was reportedly due to poor record sales, and since then Stereolab's self-owned label, Duophonic Records, has signed a distribution deal with Too Pure. Duophonic holds the copyrights to the band's recordings, and on this label the band has released many limited-edition records. In 2009, Stereolab announced via their website that they were going on indefinite hiatus."@en ;
