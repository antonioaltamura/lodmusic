	dbo:abstract	"Frederick John Elgersma (born July 9, 1957), known by the stage name Fred Eaglesmith, is a Canadian alternative country singer-songwriter, one of nine children raised by a farming family in rural Southern Ontario. As a teenager Eaglesmith hopped a freight train to Western Canada and began writing songs and performing. He is known for writing songs about machines or vehicles, including songs about trains, tractors, trucks, cars, and engines. Rural life, dogs, guns, drinking, farming and ranching are other common themes. Many of his songs are about failing farms and small businesses. Down-and-out characters dealing with loss of love or livelihood and quirky rural folk also populate his songs. His songwriting uses many of the techniques of short story writing, including unreliable narrators, surprise endings, and plot twists. Eaglesmith's bands have been known as both the Flying Squirrels and the Flathead Noodlers, switching the name to represent different styles of music. The Flathead Noodlers play bluegrass, while the Flying Squirrels play more folk and rock. An early incarnation of the band was known as the Smokin' Losers. Since 2012, performances have been billed as the Fred Eaglesmith Travelling Steam Show and include opening songs performed by Bill Poss, the Ginn Sisters, and Tif Ginn. A typical Fred Eaglesmith show includes his music set between several lengthy between-song comic monologues by Eaglesmith. Topics in the past have included stories about crossing the U.S.\u2013Canada border, Newfoundlanders, and some friends from an Indian reserve. His fans are known as \"Fredheads\", a nod to deadheads, who followed the Grateful Dead. He is known to tour extensively throughout Canada and the U.S. When Eaglesmith appears in solo performances, he bills himself as Fred J. Eaglesmith. In addition to his own albums, he frequently collaborated with the late Willie P. Bennett, a former member of Eaglesmith's band, who stepped down after a heart attack in early 2007. Eaglesmith appeared in a 2001 television movie, The Gift. Eaglesmith publishes his own records. In 2010, Eaglesmith was featured on the Late Show with David Letterman as the musical guest. He performed \"Careless\" from the album ''Cha Cha Cha''."@en ;

He is often mentioned as one of \"the Three Kings\" of electric blues guitar along with Albert King and B.B. King. Freddie King based his guitar style on Texas and Chicago influences and was one of the first bluesmen to have a multi-racial backing band at live performances. He is best known for singles such as \"Have You Ever Loved a Woman\" (1960) and his Top 40 hit \"Hide Away\" (1961). He is also known for albums such as the early, instrumental-packed Let's Hide Away and Dance Away with Freddy King (1961) and the later album Burglar (1974), which displayed King's mature versatility as both player and singer in a range of blues and funk styles. King became an influential guitarist with hits for Federal Records in the early 1960s. His soulful and powerful voice and distinctive guitar style inspired countless musicians, particularly guitarists (Eric Clapton being a notable example of a guitar legend who idolized King). He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2012."@en ;

He was born into a musical family. His father, Karim Kh\u0101n Ban\u0101n ol-Douleh Nur\u00ED (\u0643\u0631\u064A\u0645 \u062E\u0627\u0646 \u0628\u0646\u0627\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u062F\u0648\u0644\u0647 \u0646\u0648\u0631\u064A), was a musician (and calligrapher), was an accomplished pianist; one brother and two sisters also played the tar as pupils of the renowned musician Morteza Neyd\u0101vood. From the age of six Gholam-Hossein Ban\u0101n began to take lessons in singing and playing the piano and organ through the encouragement of Morteza Neyd\u0101vood (\u0645\u0631\u062A\u0636\u064A \u0646\u064A \u062F\u0627\u0648\u062F) who was quick to recognize him as musically talented. Ghol\u0101m-Hossein's first teachers were his parents. He subsequently studied with Mirz\u0101 T\u0101her Zi\u0101 oz-Z\u0101kerin Ras\u0101'\u00ED (\u0645\u064A\u0631\u0632\u0627 \u0637\u0627\u0647\u0631 \u0636\u064A\u0627\u0621 \u0630\u0627\u0643\u0631\u064A\u0646 \u0631\u062B\u0627\u064A\u064A) and N\u0101ser Seif (\u0646\u0627\u0635\u0631 \u0633\u064A\u0641). Ali-Naqi Vaziri later introduced him to the acclaimed Rouhollah Kh\u0101leghi. Ban\u0101n joined the Iranian National Music Association in 1942, and appeared on Iranian National Radio that same year. He then joined the orchestra of the distinguished pianist Jav\u0101d Maroufi, becoming the lead vocalist. In 1957 or 1958, (1336 AH) Ban\u0101n became blind in his right eye following a car accident. Ban\u0101n died 7:00 pm on Thursday 27 February 1986 (8 Esfand 1364 AH) in Iranmehr Hospital in Gholhak, Tehran. He is still remembered by lovers of traditional Persian music. Among his best-remembered songs are \"Ey Iran\", \"Caravan\" and \"Elahe-ye Naz\"."@en .

She performs with her musical partner, guitarist David Rawlings. Their sparse and dark musical style, which combines elements of Appalachian music, bluegrass, and Americana, is described by The New Yorker as \"at once innovative and obliquely reminiscent of past rural forms\". Welch and Rawlings have released five critically acclaimed albums under the name Gillian Welch and two under the name Dave Rawlings Machine. Their 1996 debut, Revival, and the 2001 release Time (The Revelator), received nominations for the Grammy Award for Best Contemporary Folk Album. Their 2003 album, Soul Journey, introduced electric guitar, drums and a more upbeat sound to their body of work. After a gap of eight years, they released their fifth studio album, The Harrow & The Harvest, in 2011, which was also nominated for a Grammy for Best Contemporary Folk Album. Welch was associate producer and performed on two songs of the O Brother, Where Art Thou? soundtrack, a platinum album that won the Grammy Award for Album of the Year in 2002.

He graduated in 1968 from Chaminade High School, then attended Manhattan College, where he was initiated as a member of Phi Mu Alpha Sinfonia music fraternity in 1969. He was interested in motorcycles, and was working as a toll collector at the Brooklyn-Battery Tunnel when he responded to an advertisement by composer Jacques Morali seeking \"macho\" singers and dancers. Hughes and other members of the band were given a crash course in the synchronized dance choreography that later typified the group's live performances. Glenn's powerful bass voice played an important part in the background vocals of almost all Village People's most hits, such as \"In the Navy\". He sported an extravagant horseshoe moustache and wore his trademark leather outfit on stage and off. As he was the band's \"biker\" and a real life fanatic, he kept his motorcycle parked inside his home. With Village People gaining fame, Hughes became one of the icons of the disco era, even appearing in a special television broadcast in Playboy Mansion with Hugh Hefner. In 1996, he retired from dancing and launched his own successful New York cabaret act, which kept him busy until he was diagnosed with lung cancer (he had been a regular smoker since he was a teenager). He was replaced by Eric Anzalone as the biker character. However, Hughes continued with management of the band. During his later years, he was known for storming the streets of New York with his custom Harley-Davidson motorcycle. Hughes, who was also referred to by the masses as \"Leatherman\", was named on People Magazine's 1979 list of most beautiful people. Hughes died in March 2001, aged 50, at his Manhattan apartment from lung cancer. He was subsequently interred (wearing his leatherman outfit) at Saint Charles Cemetery (Section 43, Row M, Plot 63) in Farmingdale, Long Island, New York."@en ;

Hart's solo career became his main focus after the dissolution of Nova Mob in 1997. As the co-songwriter of H\u00FCsker D\u00FC, Hart's songs (such as \"The Girl Who Lives on Heaven Hill\" and \"Turn on the News\") received praise from critics and contemporaries. Hart's vocal style, in contrast to that of H\u00FCsker D\u00FC bandmate Bob Mould, was a more measured and melodic delivery. His choice of lyrical themes, which ranged from teenage alienation in \"Standing by the Sea\" and the depiction of a murder in \"Diane,\" to playful story-telling in \"Books About UFOs,\" helped to expand the subject matter of hardcore punk."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Jason Forrest is an electronic music producer known for noisy experimental electronica and breakcore incorporating many ideas of mash-up and rock and roll. Largely produced and performed on a single computer (including live shows), his songs tend to be constructed from digital samples of found sounds and other artists' music. Until 2004 he recorded under the name Donna Summer, an allusion to disco singer Donna Summer. In 2005 RES magazine named Forrest's \"Steppin Off\" video, by director Jon Watts, music video of the year. In 2006 Res magazine named Forrest's video War Photographer, directed by Joel Trussell video of the year, and online magazine Pitchfork Media also named it in their top five videos of the year. Both videos have won several awards at various international film and video festivals and have both been widely viewed, downloaded and acclaimed. Forrest has released on many labels, but primarily on Sonig, the K\u00F6ln, Germany based record label. He also has releases on Irritant Records (UK), Omeko (JP), MeWe le Disque (BE), Mirex (DE), Broklyn Beats (USA), and HOSS Records (USA). Some of the more conspicuous samples of other artists to be found in Forrest's work include ones from Laurie Anderson, The Who, Supertramp, Steely Dan, Joe Jackson, Elton John, Creedence Clearwater Revival and Pat Benatar. This (along with his former stage name) shows his interest in appropriation as an artistic concept. Along with many images featured on the Cock Rock Disco web site it also shows his interest in recontextualizing popular culture from past decades. Forrest grew up in South Carolina, has lived in Atlanta and New York City and now (Winter, 2009) resides in Berlin. He has a BA in Photography. He previously worked as a professional artist as well as an art critic for the Atlanta Journal-Constitution news paper. Besides being a fan himself, there is no connection between Forrest and the pop music/disco artist, Donna Summer. In a 2003 interview with the CBC Radio program, Brave New Waves, he stated that by being a middle class white male using this name he was \"subjecting people to a fake issue of diversity\" and forcing them \"to consider gender a little bit more.\""@en ;

In 1998, Wesley and ex-White Lion frontman Mike Tramp were the opening act for the Peter Frampton/Lynyrd Skynyrd tour. Following this was several world tours with Marillion's former singer Fish. In 2001, John Wesley was the primary co-writer of Fish\u2019s Fellini Days album. Most recently, John Wesley has performed as sideman, guitarist/vocalist for Porcupine Tree, during the In Absentia, Deadwing, Fear of a Blank Planet and The Incident world tours. In 2005, Wesley produced and recorded his fifth studio release, Shiver. The album was co-produced by drummer and co-owner of his Tampa, Florida recording studio, RedRoom Recorders, Inc., Mark Prator, and mixed by Steven Wilson of Porcupine Tree. In 2011, Wesley partnered with UK native Dean Tidey (live guitarist with Feeder), to produce his EP, The Lilypad Suite. Wesley\u2019s sixth full-length studio album, Disconnect, was released in 2014. On August 24, 2007, Wesley announced that he was making his back catalog of solo material available for free download on his website. In March 2013, Wesley performed with Sound of Contact as their live guitarist for the Marillion Weekend concert in Montreal. He then joined the band for their European tour in May 2013 and was a part of two Sound of Contact music videos produced in relation to the band's debut album, Dimensionaut. Other musicians Wesley has worked beside include Sean Malone, Steve Hogarth and Steve Rothery. He has also performed as an occasional fill-in bassist and lead guitarist for Florida-based group Sister Hazel.

	dbo:abstract	"Josh Eppard (born December 6, 1979) is an American musician from Kingston, New York and the drummer for progressive rock band Coheed and Cambria. He has worked as a solo rapper under the name Weerd Science and was the drummer for supergroup rock band Terrible Things. Eppard was a founding member of the Woodstock, NY new prog outfit, 3 along with his brother Joey and studio engineer Chris Bittner. On November 2, 2006 it was announced that Eppard would be leaving Coheed and Cambria indefinitely, with Chris Pennie as his replacement. The reason for his abrupt departure from the band had been shrouded in mystery. However, in an interview with Michael Dodd of Get Your Rock Out, Eppard laid the rumors to rest. Though there was speculation Eppard had left the band due to \"creative limitations\", his split from the band actually resulted from a bout with drug addiction that had been exacerbated by the frantic touring schedule, among other things. Citing an often asked question of him as to whether he quit the band or was fired, Eppard's response was that he was likely \"about to be fired\" before he left. After leaving Coheed and Cambria, Eppard recorded his second Weerd Science album, Sick Kids, at Darkworld Studio in Kingston, NY and Applehead Studios in Woodstock, NY. The album is a creative look into the drug addiction the artist suffered, offering, in addition to a very trying personal account, an insightful social commentary on the current condition of the United States. More recently, he also formed a new rock band, Mours, with friend and collaborator Dave Parker and musician Anthony Masington. In 2009, Eppard began drumming in Terrible Things, a band he formed with fellow musicians Fred Mascherino, Andy Jackson, and bassist Steve Lucarelli, who has since left the band. They have been touring and released their debut, Terrible Things on Universal Motown on August 31, 2010. In 2011, Eppard signed with Horris Records. On November 16, 2011, Coheed and Cambria revealed on their website that Josh had officially rejoined the band. On the Terrible Things YouTube channel, Terrible Things vocalist Fred Mascherino announced that Josh had left Terrible Things."@en ;

He is known for his use of a cello bow on guitar and his falsetto or countertenor voice. He is also blind in his right eye from birth as a result of a broken optic nerve from the brain. He is openly gay. Apart from Sigur R\u00F3s, J\u00F3nsi also performs together with his partner Alex Somers as an art collaboration called J\u00F3nsi & Alex. They released their self-titled first book in November 2006, which was an embossed hardcover limited to 1000 copies, along with their first album, Riceboy Sleeps, in July 2009. On 1 December 2009, J\u00F3nsi's official website, jonsi.com, was launched in anticipation of his debut solo album, Go, which was released the week of 5 April 2010. After the release of the album, J\u00F3nsi promptly started a worldwide tour across North America and Europe, featuring songs from the album plus a few other selections, planning to tour from March to September. In late January 2010, J\u00F3nsi announced that Sigur R\u00F3s was on \"an indefinite hiatus\", as the band had scrapped plans for a new album previously announced to be released in 2010, saying that \"they were just rumours\". The band decided to take the year off, as several members of Sigur R\u00F3s recently had children, and as J\u00F3nsi developed his solo career. The band is now back together again and released the album Valtari on 28 May 2012 with a following tour starting in August of the same year, and more recently the album Kveikur on 18 June 2013."@en ;

She was born 30 June 1974 in Birmingham, England to an Irish/English mother and Indian father. Before Sneaker Pimps, Kelli was part of a group called Psycho Drama, which she joined when she was 16 years old. A few years later, she was asked by Russell Cross of the band The Lumieres to join his band (as their songwriter, singer, and lead guitarist). The Lumieres only had one major single, \"Cinder Hearts\". In the Sneaker Pimps she was featured prominently in both the songs and the music videos for the album Becoming X (the group finding fame following the release of the hit single \"6 Underground\"), but was released from the group in 1998 when they decided to do vocals for their own songs. After leaving the Sneaker Pimps, she moved on to a solo career under the name Kelli Ali. Her first solo album was Tigermouth in 2003, which included tracks \"Sunlight in the Rain\" and \"Kids,\" and featured ex-Doors drummer John Densmore. She toured alongside Garbage in 2003 and released a follow-up album, Psychic Cat, in mid-2004. The second album was more of a return to Ali's rock and roll roots and featured musician-turned-author Tony O'Neill on keyboards. In April 2006, she travelled to Japan to record and write tracks with Hoshino Hidehiko from Buck-Tick and Cube Juice for the band Dropz. The same year, producer Paul Oakenfold recorded the Kelli Ali penned song \"Faster Kill Pussycat\" with actress Brittany Murphy, which remained Murphy's only single release. On 24 November 2008, Ali released Rocking Horse, her third solo album. The album was produced by Max Richter (Fat Cat records) in Glasgow and Edinburgh in the first half of 2008. In 2009, she self-released the album Butterfly. Kelli released her 5th album in 2013, entitled Band of Angels. She has collaborated extensively with the UK band Cult With No Name."@en ;

She broke down a female barrier in country music with her 1952 hit recording, \"It Wasn't God Who Made Honky Tonk Angels\" which also made her the first female country singer to top the U.S. country charts, and turned her into the first female country star. Her Top 10 hits continued until the mid-1960s, inspiring a long list of female country singers who came to prominence in the 1960s. Wells ranks as the sixth most successful female vocalist in the history of Billboard's country charts, according to historian Joel Whitburn's book The Top 40 Country Hits, behind Dolly Parton, Loretta Lynn, Reba McEntire, Tammy Wynette, and Tanya Tucker. In 1976, she was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame. In 1991, she became the third country music artist, after Roy Acuff and Hank Williams, and the eighth woman to receive the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award. Her accomplishments earned her the nickname \"Queen of Country Music\"."@en ;

As their fame grew, the band became known as Larry Gatlin & the Gatlin Brothers. Larry Gatlin is known for his rich falsetto singing style and for the unique pop-inflected songs he wrote and recorded in the 1970's and 80's. Some of Gatlin's biggest hits include \"Broken Lady\", \"All the Gold in California\", \"Houston (Means I'm One Day Closer to You)\", \"She Used to Be Somebody's Baby\", and \"Talkin' to the Moon\". During this time, country music trended heavily towards slick pop music arrangements in a style that came to be known as Countrypolitan. Larry Gatlin and the Gatlin Brothers came to prominence and enjoyed their greatest success during this period with hit singles that showcased the brothers' three-part harmonies and Larry's poetic lyrics."@en ;
