He changed the style of the piano. You can find the roots of Bud Powell, Herbie Hancock, all the guys who came after that. If it hadn't been for Earl Hines blazing the path for the next generation to come, it's no telling where or how they would be playing now. There were individual variations but the style of ... the modern piano came from Earl Hines.\" Pianist Lennie Tristano said, \"Earl Hines is the only one of us capable of creating real jazz and real swing when playing all alone.\" Horace Silver said, \"He has a completely unique style. No one can get that sound, no other pianist\". Erroll Garner said, \"When you talk about greatness, you talk about Art Tatum and Earl Hines\".

He also played the tuba and trumpet professionally. Foster was born to Charley and Annie Foster, who \"was nearly fullblooded Cherokee,\" on a plantation near McCall in Ascension Parish near Donaldsonville in south Louisiana. His family moved to New Orleans when he was about 10 years of age. His older brother, Willard Foster, began playing banjo and guitar; George started out on a cello then switched to string bass. Foster married twice: to Bertha Foster in 1912 and Alma Foster in 1936. Pops Foster was playing professionally by 1907 and worked with Jack Carey, Kid Ory, Armand Piron, King Oliver and other prominent hot bands of the era. In 1921 he moved to St. Louis to play with the Charlie Creath and Dewey Jackson bands, in which he would be active for much of the decade. He also joined Ory in Los Angeles. He acquired the nickname \"Pops\" because he was far older than any of the other players in the band. In 1929 Foster moved to New York City, where he played with the bands of Luis Russell and Louis Armstrong through 1940. He gigged with various New York-based bands through the 1940s, including those of Sidney Bechet, Art Hodes, and regular broadcasts on the national This Is Jazz radio program. He also recorded for the Mezzrow-Bechet Quintet (Bechet, Mezz Mezzrow, Fitz Weston, and Kaiser Marshall) and Septet (on two consecutive dates in 1945, with Pappa Snow White, Jimmy Blythe, Jr., Danny Barker and Sid Catlett, and on the second session with Pleasant Joe on vocals). In the late 1940s he began touring more widely and played in many countries in Europe, especially in France, and throughout the United States including returns to New Orleans and California. In 1952, Foster toured Europe with Jimmy Archey's Band. He played regularly at Central Plaza in New York and briefly in New Orleans with Papa Celestin in 1954. In the late 1950s and early 1960s, he played with Earl Hines' Small Band. In 1966, he toured Europe with the New Orleans All-Stars but remained based in San Francisco, where he died. The Autobiography of Pops Foster was published in 1971, with a new edition in 2005. Foster is quoted, \"Some of the books are fouled up on\" the times in New Orleans\", \"and some of the guys weren't telling the truth.\" \"The citics and guys who write about jazz think they know more about what went on in New Orleans that the guys that were there.\""@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Jos\u00E9 Alfredo Jim\u00E9nez-Sandoval (Spanish pronunciation: [xo\u02C8se al\u02C8f\u027Ee\u00F0o xi\u02C8menes]; 19 January 1926 \u2013 23 November 1973) was a Mexican singer-songwriter of rancheras, whose songs are considered an integral part of Mexico's musical heritage. Jim\u00E9nez was born in Dolores Hidalgo, Guanajuato. According to the singer Miguel Aceves Mej\u00EDa, he did not play an instrument and did not even know the Spanish word for \"waltz\" or what \"keys\" his songs were in. Nonetheless, he composed more than 1,000 songs. Among the most famous are \"Me Equivoqu\u00E9 Contigo\", \"Ella\", \"Paloma querida\", \"T\u00FA y la mentira\", \"Media vuelta\", \"El Rey\", \"Sin Sangre en las Venas\", \"El jinete\", \"Si nos Dejan\", \"Amanec\u00ED en tus Brazos\", \"Llegando a ti\", \"Tu recuerdo y yo\", El Hijo del Pueblo\", \"Cuando el Destino\", \"El caballo blanco\", \"Lleg\u00F3 Borracho el Borracho\" and \"Que te vaya bonito\", as well as \"Camino de Guanajuato\", where he sang about his home state of Guanajuato. In addition to his own recordings, many of his songs have been recorded by renowned artists from around the Spanish-speaking world, most notably by the following artists: Miguel Aceves Mej\u00EDa, Antonio Aguilar, Luis Aguilar, Lola Beltr\u00E1n, Vikki Carr, Gualberto Castro, Roc\u00EDo D\u00FArcal, Alejandro Fern\u00E1ndez, Pedro Fern\u00E1ndez, Vicente Fern\u00E1ndez, Los Rel\u00E1mpagos Del Norte con Cornelio Reyna y Ram\u00F3n Ayala, Los Tigres del Norte, Manolo Garc\u00EDa, Little Joe Hern\u00E1ndez & The Latinaires, Julio Iglesias, Pedro Infante, the Mexican rock group Man\u00E1, Luis Miguel, Jorge Negrete, Sunny Ozuna & The Sunliners, Mar\u00EDa Dolores Pradera, Javier Sol\u00EDs, and Chavela Vargas. In addition, Joaqu\u00EDn Sabina paid homage to Jim\u00E9nez with his song, \"Por el Bulevar de los Sue\u00F1os Rotos\" (\"On the Boulevard of Broken Dreams\"). The country artist Luke Tan recorded a disc of his favorite Jim\u00E9nez songs in Spanish, including some English translations. Like many of his contemporary stars, such as Jorge Negrete, Pedro Infante, and Javier Sol\u00EDs, Jim\u00E9nez died young. He was only forty-seven years old when he died in Mexico City, of complications resulting from cirrhosis of the liver. One of his last appearances on Mexican television occurred in 1973, just months prior to his death, where he introduced his last song, Gracias, accompanied by his wife, singer Alicia Juarez. It was his way of thanking the public for all of the affection they had shown him throughout his career as one of the most prolific and highly regarded composers and singers Mexico has ever produced."@en .

Though he has been involved with numerous music projects and bands (Mistigo Varggoth Darkestra, Lucifugum (as a guest musician in 1997), \u0412\u0435\u0447\u0435), he is most well known for being the lead vocalist and guitarist for the Ukrainian black metal band Nokturnal Mortum. Nokturnal Mortum gained their reputation performing symphonic black metal with elements of Ukrainian and Slavic folk music. Another side project done by Varggoth is Mistigo Varggoth Darkestra, an ambient/black metal project formed in 1994. The most famous album of this project, The Key To The Gates Of The Apocalypse, is most likely known particularly due to its long runtime (one 72-minute track) and combination of dark ambient and fast black metal. In autumn of 2014 in order to avoid rumors concerning his personal views and band ideology Varggoth published the statement declaring that he and Nokturnal Mortum was out of politics."@en ;

Brodszky was born in Odessa (now in Ukraine), to Hungarian parents, and he spoke Hungarian throughout his life. He spent many years studying and working in Rome, Vienna, Berlin and Budapest. In the 1920s he contributed songs to Viennese operettas. His first film was made in Vienna in 1930 and featured Richard Tauber and Gitta Alpar. He emigrated to the United States in 1934. He composed for many musical films including The Toast of New Orleans (1950); Rich Young and Pretty (1951); Because You're Mine (1952); Small Town Girl (1953); The Student Prince (1954); Love Me or Leave Me (1955); and Serenade (1956). He also wrote the score for the Yiddish language film Die Purimspieler (1939). Among the hit songs he wrote with lyricist Sammy Cahn were \"Be My Love,\" \"I'll Never Stop Loving You,\" \"Because You're Mine,\" \"Serenade,\" and \"My Destiny.\" He wrote three songs for The Student Prince: \"Summertime in Heidelberg,\" \"Beloved,\" and \"I'll Walk with God\" (with lyrics by Paul Francis Webster) to supplement the Sigmund Romberg musical score for the 1954 filmed version. Recordings of two of his songs, \"Be My Love\" and \"Because You're Mine,\" were million-seller hits (Gold Records) for the famous 1950s tenor and movie star Mario Lanza on the RCA Victor Red Seal label. Five of Nicholas Brodszky's musical compositions were nominated for Academy Awards for Best Original Song: \n*  1950, \"Be My Love\"  \n*  1951, \"Wonder Why\"  \n*  1952, \"Because You're Mine\"  \n*  1953, \"My Flaming Heart\"  \n*  1955, \"I'll Never Stop Loving You\". He died in Hollywood, California in 1958, aged 53. Brodszky was a tunesmith who always needed the help of arrangers and assistants to turn his ideas into finished compositions. These assistants included Roy Douglas, Mischa Spoliansky and Charles Williams, but they were rarely credited. Lionel Salter termed Brodszky a 'near-illiterate.'"@en .

In 1996, Cindy released her first solo album, Untitled. The original pressing of the LP had no artist name on the sleeve at the time, but Cindy's name was later added for re-pressings. The album features engineering work by Jim O'Rourke, and guitar and vocals by Bill Callahan. In 1998, she did the vocals for a remix of \"Torture Day\" by The Notwist. In 2002, Cindy released her second album, Sound Restores Young Men, which was recorded by O'Rourke and Tim Green of The Fucking Champs. Cindy suffered from epilepsy.

An artist in the electronica music genre, he is credited as a pioneer of the trance and intelligent dance music styles that paved the way for EDM, and for \"stretching electronic music to its technical breaking point.\" He also creates music within many other styles, such as classical, film composition and bass music. BT is also known for pioneering the stutter edit. This production technique consists of taking a small fragment of sound and repeating it rhythmically. BT was entered into the Guinness Book of World Records for his song \"Somnambulist (Simply Being Loved)\", recognized as using the largest number of vocal edits in a song (6,178 edits). BT's work with stutter edit techniques led to the formation of software development company Sonik Architects, developer of the sound-processing software plug-ins Stutter Edit and BreakTweaker, and the live audio and visual remix app called Sonifi. In 2010, BT was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Electronic/Dance Album for These Hopeful Machines. He has produced, remixed, written for, and collaborated with a variety of artists, including Paul van Dyk, Peter Gabriel, Tori Amos, Depeche Mode, NSYNC, Sting, Blake Lewis, The Roots, Guru, Madonna, Britney Spears and Ti\u00EBsto, and composed original scores for films such as Go, The Fast and the Furious and Monster."@en ;

His style of banjo playing, as well as his singing, is considered a unique combination of Appalachian folk music and African-American blues. Contemporary folk musicians and performers consider him a seminal figure, at least in part because of the appearance of two of his recordings from the 1920s, \"Sugar Baby\" and \"Country Blues\", on Harry Smith's 1951 Anthology of American Folk Music collection. Boggs was initially recorded in 1927 and again in 1929, although he worked primarily as a coal miner for most of his life.

As a member of Queen, he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2001, the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 2003, the UK Music Hall of Fame in 2004, and the band received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 2002. In 2002, he was placed at number 58 in the BBC's poll of the 100 Greatest Britons. Consistently voted one of the greatest singers in the history of popular music, Mercury was voted best male singer of all time in a 2005 poll organised by Blender and MTV2; was ranked at 18 on the 2008 Rolling Stone list of the 100 greatest singers ever; was elected in 2009 as the best rock singer of all time by Classic Rock; \u2014 and was described by AllMusic as \"one of rock's greatest all-time entertainers,\" with \"one of the greatest voices in all of music.\""@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Genesis Breyer P-Orridge (born 22 February 1950), born Neil Andrew Megson, is an English singer-songwriter, musician, poet, performance artist, and occultist. After rising to notability as the founder of the COUM Transmissions artistic collective and then fronting the industrial band Throbbing Gristle, P-Orridge was a founding member of Thee Temple ov Psychick Youth occult group, and fronted the experimental band Psychic TV. P-Orridge identifies as third gender. Born in Manchester, P-Orridge developed an early interest in art, occultism, and the avant-garde while at Solihull School. After dropping out of studies at the University of Hull, they moved into a counter-cultural commune in London and adopted Genesis P-Orridge as a nom-de-guerre. On returning to Hull, P-Orridge founded COUM Transmissions with Cosey Fanni Tutti, and in 1973 they relocated to London. COUM's confrontational performance work, dealing with such subjects as sex work, pornography, serial killers, and occultism, represented a concerted attempt to challenge societal norms and attracted the attention of the national press. COUM's 1976 Prostitution show at London's Institute of Contemporary Arts was particularly vilified by tabloids, gaining them the moniker of the \"wreckers of civilization.\" P-Orridge's band, Throbbing Gristle, grew out of COUM, and were active from 1975 to 1981 as pioneers in the industrial music genre. In 1981, P-Orridge co-founded Psychic TV, an experimental band that from 1988 onward came under the increasing influence of acid house. In 1981, P-Orridge co-founded Thee Temple ov Psychick Youth, an informal occult order influenced by chaos magic and experimental music. P-Orridge was often seen as the group's leader, but rejected that position, and left the group in 1991. Amid the Satanic ritual abuse hysteria, a 1992 Channel 4 documentary accused P-Orridge of sexually abusing children, resulting in a police investigation. P-Orridge was subsequently cleared and Channel 4 retracted their allegation. P-Orridge left the United Kingdom as a result of the incident and settled in New York City. There, P-Orridge married Jacqueline Mary Breyer in 1993, and together they embarked on the Pandrogeny Project, an attempt to unite as a \"pandrogyne\", or single entity, through the use of surgical body modification to physically resemble one another. P-Orridge continued with this project of body modification after Lady Jaye's 2007 death. Although involved in reunions of both Throbbing Gristle and Psychic TV in the 2000s, P-Orridge retired from music to focus on other artistic mediums in 2009. P-Orridge is credited on over 200 releases. A controversial figure with an anti-establishment stance, P-Orridge has been heavily criticised by the British press and politicians. P-Orridge has been cited as an icon within the avant-garde art scene, accrued a cult following, and been given the moniker of the \"Godperson of Industrial Music\"."@en ;

His work is characterized by pioneering overdub experiments, returns to the Great American Songbook, and fusions of Caribbean sounds. A tenor with a three-and-a-half octave range, Nilsson was one of the few major pop-rock recording artists of his era to achieve significant commercial success without ever performing major public concerts or undertaking regular tours. He is known for the charting singles \"Everybody's Talkin'\" (1969), \"Without You\" (1971), and \"Coconut\" (1972). Nilsson also wrote the song \"One\" (1968), made famous by the rock band Three Dog Night. His honors include Grammy Awards for two of his recordings; Best Contemporary Vocal Performance, Male in 1970 for \"Everybody's Talkin'\", a prominent song in the 1969 film Midnight Cowboy, and Best Pop Vocal Performance, Male in 1973 for \"Without You\".

	dbo:abstract	"Jo Elizabeth Stafford (November 12, 1917 \u2013 July 16, 2008) was an American traditional pop music singer and occasional actress, whose career spanned five decades from the late 1930s to the early 1980s. Admired for the purity of her voice, she originally underwent classical training to become an opera singer before following a career in popular music, and by 1955 had achieved more worldwide record sales than any other female artist. Her 1952 song \"You Belong to Me\" topped the charts in the United States and United Kingdom, the record becoming the first by a female artist to reach number one on the U.K. Singles Chart. Born in Coalinga, California, Stafford made her first musical appearance at age twelve. While still at high school she joined her two older sisters to form a vocal trio named The Stafford Sisters, who found moderate success on radio and in film. In 1938, while the sisters were part of the cast of Twentieth Century Fox's production of Alexander's Ragtime Band, Stafford met the future members of The Pied Pipers and became the group's lead singer. Bandleader Tommy Dorsey hired them in 1939 to perform back-up vocals for his orchestra. In addition to her recordings with the Pied Pipers, Stafford featured in solo performances for Dorsey. After leaving the group in 1944, she recorded a series of pop standards for Capitol Records and Columbia Records. Many of her recordings were backed by the orchestra of Paul Weston. She also performed duets with Gordon MacRae and Frankie Laine. Her work with the United Service Organizations (USO) giving concerts for soldiers during World War II earned her the nickname \"G.I. Jo\". Starting in 1945, Stafford was a regular host of the National Broadcasting Company (NBC) radio series The Chesterfield Supper Club and later appeared in television specials\u2014including two series called The Jo Stafford Show, in 1954 in the U.S. and in 1961 in the U.K. Stafford married twice: first in 1937 to musician John Huddleston (the couple divorced in 1943); then in 1952 to Paul Weston, with whom she had two children. She and Weston developed a comedy routine in which they assumed the identity of an incompetent lounge act named Jonathan and Darlene Edwards, parodying well-known songs. The act proved popular at parties and among the wider public when the couple released an album as the Edwardses in 1957. In 1961, the album Jonathan and Darlene Edwards in Paris won Stafford her only Grammy Award for Best Comedy Album, and was the first commercially successful parody album. Stafford largely retired as a performer in the mid-1960s, but continued in the music business. She had a brief resurgence in popularity in the late 1970s when she recorded a cover of the Bee Gees hit, \"Stayin' Alive\" as Darlene Edwards. In the 1990s, she began re-releasing some of her material through Corinthian Records, a label founded by Weston. She died in 2008 in Century City, Los Angeles, and is interred with Weston at Holy Cross Cemetery, Culver City. Her work in radio, television and music is recognized by three stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame."@en ;

He composed the scores for 11 of the James Bond films between 1963 and 1987, and also arranged and performed the \"James Bond Theme\" to the first film in the series, 1962's Dr. No. He wrote the Grammy and Academy Award-winning scores to the films Dances with Wolves and Out of Africa, as well as the theme for the British television cult series The Persuaders!, in a career spanning over 50 years. In 1999, he was appointed OBE at Buckingham Palace for services to music. Born in York, Barry spent his early years working in cinemas owned by his father. During his national service with the British Army in Cyprus, Barry began performing as a musician after learning to play the trumpet. Upon completing his national service, he formed his own band in 1957, The John Barry Seven. He later developed an interest in composing and arranging music, making his d\u00E9but for television in 1958. He came to the notice of the makers of the first James Bond film Dr. No, who were dissatisfied with a theme for James Bond given to them by Monty Norman. This started a successful association between Barry and Eon Productions which lasted for 25 years. He received many awards for his work, including five Academy Awards; two for Born Free, and one each for The Lion in Winter (for which he also won the first BAFTA Award for Best Film Music), Dances with Wolves and Out of Africa (both of which also won him Grammy Awards). He also received ten Golden Globe Award nominations, winning once for Best Original Score for Out of Africa in 1986. Barry completed his last film score, Enigma, in 2001 and recorded the successful album Eternal Echoes the same year. He then concentrated chiefly on live performances and co-wrote the music to the musical Brighton Rock in 2004 alongside Don Black. He was made a Fellow of the British Academy of Film and Television Arts in 2005. Barry was married four times and had four children. He moved to the United States in 1975 and lived there for the remainder of his life until his death in 2011."@en ;

He incorporates diverse styles in his compositions which he identifies as avant-garde or experimental. Zorn was described by Down Beat as \"one of our most important composers\". Zorn established himself within the New York City downtown music movement in the mid-1970s performing with musicians across the sonic spectrum and developing experimental methods of composing new music. After releasing albums on several independent US and European labels, Zorn signed with Elektra Nonesuch and received wide acclaim with the release of The Big Gundown, an album reworking the compositions of Ennio Morricone. He attracted further attention worldwide with the release of Spillane in 1987, and Naked City in 1989. After spending almost a decade travelling between Japan and the US he made New York his permanent base and established his own record label, Tzadik, in the mid-1990s. Tzadik enabled Zorn to maintain independence from the mainstream music industry and ensured the continued availability of his growing catalog of recordings, allowing him to prolifically record and release new material, issuing several new albums each year, as well as promoting the work of many other musicians. Zorn has led the hardcore bands Naked City and Painkiller, the klezmer/free jazz-influenced quartet Masada, composed over 600 pieces as part of the Masada Songbooks that have been performed by an array of groups, composed concert music for classical ensembles and orchestras, and produced music for opera, sound installations, film and documentary. Zorn has undertaken many tours of Europe, Asia, and the Middle East, often performing at festivals with many other musicians and ensembles that perform his diverse output. Zorn's compositions cross many genres and he has stated \"All the various styles are organically connected to one another. I'm an additive person\u2014the entire storehouse of my knowledge informs everything I do. People are so obsessed with the surface that they can't see the connections, but they are there.\" For Zorn \"Composing is more than just imagining music\u2014it's knowing how to communicate it to musicians. And you don't give an improviser music that's completely written out, or ask a classical musician to improvise. I'm interested in speaking to musicians in their own languages, on their own terms, and in bringing out the best in what they do. To challenge them and excite them.\""@en ;

In the late 1990s, Timberlake rose to prominence as one of the two lead vocalists and youngest member of NSYNC, which eventually became one of the best-selling boy bands of all time. During the group's hiatus, Timberlake released his debut solo album, the R&B-focused Justified (2002), which included the successful singles \"Cry Me a River\" and \"Rock Your Body\", and earned his first two Grammy Awards. His critically acclaimed second album, FutureSex/LoveSounds (2006), characterized by its wide range of musical influences, debuted atop the US Billboard 200 and produced the Billboard Hot 100 number-one singles \"SexyBack\", \"My Love\", and \"What Goes Around... Comes Around\". With his first two albums exceeding sales of 10 million copies worldwide, he was established as one of the most commercially successful singers of the decade. He also has collaborated with other artists, including \"Give It to Me\" (with Timbaland) and \"4 Minutes\" (with Madonna). From 2008 through 2012, Timberlake focused on his acting career, effectively putting his music career on hiatus; he held starring roles in the films The Social Network, Bad Teacher, In Time, and Friends with Benefits. Timberlake resumed his music career in 2013 with his third and fourth albums The 20/20 Experience and The 20/20 Experience \u2013 2 of 2, exploring neo soul styles with the song structures of 1960s and 1970s rock. The former became the best-selling album of the year in the US with the largest sales week, and spawned the top-three singles \"Suit & Tie\" and \"Mirrors\", while the latter produced the top-ten song \"Not a Bad Thing\". They were supported by The 20/20 Experience World Tour, which originated the concert film Justin Timberlake + The Tennessee Kids, named after the accompanying band in his live performances. In 2016, Timberlake will voice the lead character in DreamWorks Animation's Trolls, which soundtrack includes his fifth Billboard Hot 100 chart-topping single, \"Can't Stop the Feeling!\".

Raised in Chicago, West first became known as a producer for Roc-A-Fella Records in the early 2000s, producing hit singles for artists such as Jay Z and Alicia Keys. Intent on pursuing a solo career as a rapper, West released his debut album The College Dropout in 2004 to widespread critical and commercial success. He went on to pursue a variety of different styles on subsequent albums including Late Registration (2005), Graduation (2007), and the polarizing 808s & Heartbreak (2008). In 2010, he released his acclaimed fifth album My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy, and the following year he collaborated with Jay Z on the joint LP Watch the Throne (2011). West released his abrasive sixth album, Yeezus, to further critical praise in 2013. His seventh album, The Life of Pablo, was released in 2016. West's outspoken views and life outside of music have received significant mainstream attention. He has been a frequent source of controversy and public scrutiny for his conduct at award shows, on social media, and in other public settings. His more publicized comments include his off-script denunciation of President George W. Bush during a live 2005 television broadcast for Hurricane Katrina relief and his interruption of singer Taylor Swift at the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards. West's efforts as a fashion designer include collaborations with Nike, Louis Vuitton, and A.P.C. on both clothing and footwear, and have most prominently resulted in the YEEZY collaboration with Adidas beginning in 2013. He is the founder and head of the creative content company DONDA. His 2014 marriage to television personality Kim Kardashian has also been subject to widespread media coverage. West is among the most acclaimed musicians of the 21st century, and is one of the best-selling artists of all time, having sold more than 32 million albums and 100 million digital downloads worldwide.

	dbo:abstract	"Dwayne Michael Carter Jr. (born September 27, 1982), known professionally as Lil Wayne, is an American hip hop recording artist and author from New Orleans, Louisiana. In 1991, at the age of nine, Lil Wayne joined Cash Money Records as the youngest member of the label, and half of the duo The B.G.'z, alongside fellow New Orleans-based rapper Lil' Doogie. In 1996, Lil Wayne formed the southern hip hop group Hot Boys, with his Cash Money label-mates Juvenile, Young Turk and Lil' Doogie (who now goes by B.G.). Hot Boys debuted with Get It How U Live!, that same year. Most of the group's success came with their platinum-selling album Guerrilla Warfare (1999) and the 1999 single \"Bling Bling\". Along with being the flagship artist of Cash Money Records, Lil Wayne is also the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of his own label imprint, Young Money Entertainment, which he founded in 2005. Lil Wayne's solo debut album Tha Block Is Hot (1999), was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). His subsequent albums, Lights Out (2000) and 500 Degreez (2002), went on to be certified gold. Wayne reached higher popularity with his fourth album Tha Carter (2004), which was led by the single \"Go D.J.\" and his appearance on Destiny's Child's Top 10 single \"Soldier\", that same year. The album was followed by Tha Carter II (2005), as well as several mixtapes and collaborations throughout 2006 and 2007. Wayne gained more prominence with his sixth album Tha Carter III (2008), which became his most successful album to date, with first-week sales of over one million copies in the United States. The album won the Grammy Award for Best Rap Album and includes the hit singles \"Lollipop\", \"A Milli\" and \"Got Money\". Following the success of Tha Carter III, Wayne decided to record a rock-esque album titled Rebirth. The album, released in 2010, was certified gold by the RIAA, despite a generally negative critical response. In March 2010, Lil Wayne began serving an 8-month jail sentence in New York after being convicted of criminal possession of a weapon stemming from an incident in July 2007. Wayne's eighth album I Am Not a Human Being (2010), was released during his incarceration. His 2011 album and first following his release, Tha Carter IV, sold 964,000 copies in its first week of availability in the United States. It includes the singles \"6 Foot 7 Foot\", \"How to Love\" and \"She Will\". On September 27, 2012, Lil Wayne passed Elvis Presley as the male with the most entries on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, with 109 songs. Lil Wayne's thirteenth studio album, Tha Carter V has been delayed multiple times and has no scheduled release date. Lil Wayne has sold over 100 million records worldwide, including sold more than 15 million albums and 37 million digital tracks in United States, making him one of the best-selling artists of all time."@en ;

She achieved popularity by pushing the boundaries of lyrical content in mainstream popular music and imagery in her music videos, which became a fixture on MTV. Madonna is known for reinventing both her music and image, and for maintaining her autonomy within the recording industry. Music critics have acclaimed her musical productions, which have generated some controversy. Referred to as the \"Queen of Pop\", Madonna is often cited as an influence by other artists. Born in Bay City, Michigan, Madonna moved to New York City in 1977 to pursue a career in modern dance. After performing in the music groups Breakfast Club and Emmy, she signed with Sire Records (an auxiliary label of Warner Bros. Records) in 1982 and released her eponymous debut album the following year. She followed it with a series of commercially and critically successful albums, including the Grammy Award winners Ray of Light (1998) and Confessions on a Dance Floor (2005). Throughout her career, Madonna has written and produced most of her songs, with many of them reaching number one on the record charts, including \"Like a Virgin\", \"Papa Don't Preach\", \"Like a Prayer\", \"Vogue\", \"Take a Bow\", \"Frozen\", \"Music\", \"Hung Up\", and \"4 Minutes\". Madonna's popularity was further enhanced by her film roles, including Desperately Seeking Susan (1985), Dick Tracy (1990), and Evita (1996); the latter earned her a Golden Globe Award for Best Actress. However, most of her other films have been panned by critics. Her other ventures include fashion design, writing children's books, and filmmaking. She has been acclaimed as a businesswoman, particularly after she founded entertainment company Maverick (including the label Maverick Records). In 2007 she signed an unprecedented US $120 million 360 deal with Live Nation, which led to a record deal with Interscope Records. Having sold more than 300 million records worldwide, Madonna is recognized as the best-selling female recording artist of all time by Guinness World Records. The Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) listed her as the best-selling female rock artist of the 20th century and the second highest-certified female artist in the United States, with 64.5 million album units. Madonna is the highest-grossing solo touring artist of all time, earning US $1.31 billion from her concerts since 1990. Madonna became one of the five founding members of the UK Music Hall of Fame and was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in her first year of eligibility. She was ranked at number one on VH1's list of 100 Greatest Women in Music and number two (behind only The Beatles) on Billboard's list of Greatest Hot 100 Artists of All Time."@en ;

Born and raised in Franklin, Tennessee, she held minor roles in the television series Doc and the film Big Fish in her childhood. Cyrus became a teen idol for her portrayal of the starring character Miley Stewart in the Disney Channel television series Hannah Montana in 2006; her father Billy Ray Cyrus additionally starred in the show. Cyrus subsequently signed a recording contract with Hollywood Records; her debut studio album Meet Miley Cyrus (2007) was certified triple-platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for exceeding three million shipments. Cyrus released her second album Breakout and launched her film career as a voice actress in the animated film Bolt in 2008. Cyrus starred in the feature film Hannah Montana: The Movie, and began cultivating a maturing image with her EP The Time of Our Lives in 2009. In 2010, she released her third album Can't Be Tamed, which stands as the lowest-selling record of her career, and starred in the coming-of-age film The Last Song. Cyrus focused on her acting career with several television and film appearances in 2011 and 2012. Her sexually explicit behavior generated widespread controversy while promoting her fourth album Bangerz (2013), her first under her recording contract with RCA Records. Cyrus' independently-released fifth studio album Miley Cyrus & Her Dead Petz (2015) deviated from her traditional pop style for more psychedelic experimentation. In 2016, she was announced as a coach for the eleventh season of the singing competition series The Voice. With Bangerz, Cyrus achieved her third number-one album on the U.S. Billboard 200, and fifth overall including the soundtrack albums for Disney's Hannah Montana series.

Cyrus has earned numerous awards and nominations, as Billboard ranked her as the fourth best-selling female artist of 2009. Cyrus was ranked number thirteen on Forbes' Celebrity 100 in 2010, and in 2013 was declared \"Artist of the Year\" by MTV.

	dbo:abstract	"Otis Ray Redding, Jr. (September 9, 1941 \u2013 December 10, 1967) was an American singer, songwriter, record producer, arranger, and talent scout. He is considered one of the greatest singers in the history of American popular music and a seminal artist in soul music and rhythm and blues. His singing style influenced many other soul artists of the 1960s. During his lifetime, his recordings were produced by Stax Records, based in Memphis, Tennessee, and exemplify the sound of Stax. Born and raised in the US state of Georgia, Redding quit school at age 15 to support his family, working with Little Richard's backing band, the Upsetters, and performing at talent shows for prize money. In 1958, he joined Johnny Jenkins's band, the Pinetoppers, with whom he toured the Southern states as a singer and driver. An unscheduled appearance on a Stax recording session led to a contract and his first single, \"These Arms of Mine,\" in 1962. Stax released Redding's debut album, Pain in My Heart, two years later. Initially popular mainly with African-Americans, Redding later reached a wider American pop music audience. Along with his group, he first played small gigs in the American South. He later performed at the popular Los Angeles night club Whisky a Go Go and toured Europe, performing in London, Paris and other major cities. He also performed at the Monterey Pop Festival in 1967. Shortly before his death in a plane crash, Redding wrote and recorded his iconic \"(Sittin' on) The Dock of the Bay\" with Steve Cropper. The song became the first posthumous number-one record on both the Billboard Hot 100 and R&B charts. The album The Dock of the Bay was the first posthumous album to reach number one on the UK Albums Chart. Redding's premature death devastated Stax. Already on the verge of bankruptcy, the label soon discovered that Atlantic Records owned the rights to his entire song catalog. Redding received many posthumous accolades, including the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award and induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and the Songwriters Hall of Fame. In addition to \"(Sittin' on) The Dock of the Bay,\" \"Respect\" and \"Try a Little Tenderness\" are among his best-known songs."@en ;

In 1986, he released Graceland, an album inspired by South African township music. Simon also wrote and starred in the film One-Trick Pony (1980) and co-wrote the Broadway musical The Capeman (1998) with the poet Derek Walcott.

She is the second wife and widow of singer-songwriter John Lennon of The Beatles. Ono grew up in Tokyo, and studied at Gakushuin. She withdrew from her course after two years and rejoined her family in New York in 1953. She spent some time at Sarah Lawrence College, and then became involved in New York City's downtown artists scene, including the Fluxus group. She first met Lennon in 1966 at her own art exhibition in London, and they became a couple in 1968. Ono and Lennon famously used their honeymoon at the Hilton Amsterdam as a stage for public protests against the Vietnam War with their performance, Bed-Ins for Peace, in Amsterdam and Montreal in 1969. She brought feminism to the forefront in her music, influencing artists as diverse as the B-52s and Meredith Monk. Ono achieved commercial and critical acclaim in 1980 with the chart-topping album Double Fantasy, a collaboration with Lennon released three weeks before his death. Public appreciation of Ono's work has shifted over time, helped by a retrospective at a Whitney Museum branch in 1989 and the 1992 release of the six-disc box set Onobox. Retrospectives of her artwork have also been presented at the Japan Society in New York City in 2001, in Bielefeld, Germany, and the UK in 2008, and Frankfurt, and Bilbao, Spain, in 2013. She received a Golden Lion Award for lifetime achievement from the Venice Biennale in 2009 and the 2012 Oskar Kokoschka Prize, Austria's highest award for applied contemporary art. As Lennon's widow, Ono works to preserve his legacy. She funded Strawberry Fields in New York City, the Imagine Peace Tower in Iceland, and the John Lennon Museum in Saitama, Japan (which closed in 2010). She has made significant philanthropic contributions to the arts, peace, Philippine and Japan disaster relief, and other causes. In 2012 Yoko Ono received the Dr.Rainer Hildebrandt Human Rights Award endowed by Alexandra Hildebrandt. The award is given annually in recognition of extraordinary, non-violent commitment to human rights. Ono continues her social activism, inaugurating a biennial $50,000 LennonOno Grant for Peace in 2002 and co-founding the group Artists Against Fracking in 2012. She has a daughter, Kyoko Chan Cox, from her marriage to Anthony Cox and a son, Sean Taro Ono Lennon, from her marriage to Lennon, with whom she collaborates musically."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Fernando Villalona, the first artist named \"El Mayimbe\" (born in Loma de Cabrera, Dajab\u00F3n Province on May 7, 1955, Ram\u00F3n Fernando Villalona \u00C9vora), is a Dominican merengue singer that began singing in the early 1970s, his popularity started to grow by the late 1970s and has not declined ever since.Fernando began singing at a very early age and became popular after participating in \"El Festival de la Voz\", an amateur TV talent show. After that, merengue icon Wilfrido Vargas hired him to be part of his group Los Hijos del Rey but Fernando and the group would soon be separated after his popularity became larger than the group itself. He would then go into a period of drugs and isolation but never stopped singing, recording some of his best music during that period. In 2012, Villalona recorded \"El Color de tu Mirada\" with American singer/songwriter Victoria Daly. The music video was directed by Rene Brea in the Dominican Republic. It went to be nominated for \"Best Music Video\" at the Soberano Awards in 2013. Villalona began recording two singles with Latin sensation, Olga Ta\u00F1on. Recording began in April, set to be released on her upcoming album. Songs such as \"Tabaco y ron\", \"Celos,\", \"Te Amo Demasiado,\",\"La Hamaquita\", \"Dominicano Soy,\" \"Son\u00E1mbulo,\" and \"Carnaval\" among others became popular in the 1980s. \"Quisqueya,\" \"No Podr\u00E1s,\" \"M\u00FAsica Latina,\" \"Retorno,\" and \"Me he Enamorado\" were some of his biggest hits in the 1990s. In recent years he has had some health problems making performing a difficult task. But besides the fact that he has not been able to perform frequently, he probably still is the most important merengue singer in Dominican history. He was married to Evelyn Jorge a woman of Puerto Rican origin and they have a daughter named Paloma."@en ;

Suzuki also appeared as an event girl for Minolta from 1998 to 2000.

Since 1998, Suzuki hasn't returned as a race queen, sticking to traditional modeling. Also, no idol videos or photo books have been released since 2003.

He had first contacts with music in Secondary music school in Bitola. During his music education he was a member of many music bands in his native town Bitola. His first major success was in 1989 when he participated in the Macedonian music festival Valandovo as a songwriter of the song \"Ako odam vo Bitola\" (\"If I go to Bitola\"), performed by Oktet Makedonija. With this song he won the third place from the jury. This song is one of the most famous songs ever written about the town of Bitola and the lyrics are about Bitola's old traditions. \"Ako odam vo Bitola\" is used in making many documentaries and music events dedicated to Bitola. Taking into consideration the fact that this song is still popular, cover of this song was made by the most famous Macedonian music star To\u0161e Proeski on his ethnic album \"Bo\u017Eilak\" (\"Rainbow\"). This cover was in different style from the original song, but it was well accepted from the audience. In 1989 he achieved another great music success on the most famous Macedonian pop festival MakFest, where he participated as a songwriter of the smash Macedonian hit \"Letaj mi letaj gulabe\" (\"Fly, my dove\") performed by the famous Croatian singer Krunoslav \"Ki\u0107o\" Slabinac. This song won the second place, missing the first place for only one vote from the audience. However, he won the prize for best lyrics for this song. Although this song didn't win, it is still popular in the Balkans. In 1991, he wrote maybe his most famous song \"Stariot d\u017Eumbu\u0161lija\" performed by the famous Serbian folk singer Ana Bekuta, on the Valandovo festival. The song was ranked 4th missing the 3rd place for 3 votes. This was a smash hit in the Republic of Macedonia winning the prize for most listened song from the audience next year. The same year, he took part on MakFest as a composer of the song \"Rozite pak se tazni\" (\"Roses are still sad\") performed by Slovenian singer Simona Weiss.As a songwriter he participated twice on Skopje Fest, a festival that has been used as Macedonian national selection for Eurovision Song Contest: \n*  1998, \"Son\" (\"Dream\"), performed by Monika Sokolovska. \n*  2000, \"Dali ti si ova nebo\" (\"Are you this heaven\"), performed by Marjan Stojanoski. Throughout his career, he is best recognized as a songwriter of traditional folk songs, where the basic inspiration is Bitola, his native town.U.S. flute and guitar duo \"Alma Nova\" covered his song \"Ako odam vo Bitola\" on their album \"After hours\",with title \"Bitola\", recorded February,2009."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Allan Holdsworth (born 6 August 1946) is a British guitarist and composer. He has released twelve studio albums as a solo artist and played a variety of musical styles spanning a period of more than four decades, but is best known for his work in jazz fusion. Holdsworth is noted for his advanced knowledge of music, through which he incorporates a vast array of complex chord progressions and intricate solos; the latter comprising myriad scale forms often derived from those such as the diminished, augmented, whole tone, chromatic and altered scales, among others, resulting in an unpredictable and \"outside\" sound. His unique legato soloing technique stems from his desire to originally play the saxophone, but having been unable to afford one he thus intentionally utilised the guitar in order to make it sound like a different instrument. He has also become associated with playing an early form of guitar synthesizer called the SynthAxe, a company which he endorsed in the 1980s. Holdsworth has been cited as an influence by such renowned rock, metal and jazz guitarists as Eddie Van Halen, Joe Satriani, Greg Howe, Shawn Lane, Richie Kotzen, John Petrucci, Alex Lifeson, Kurt Rosenwinkel, Yngwie Malmsteen, and Michael Romeo. Frank Zappa once lauded him as \"one of the most interesting guys on guitar on the planet\", while Robben Ford has said: \"I think Allan Holdsworth is the John Coltrane of the guitar. I don't think anyone can do as much with the guitar as Allan Holdsworth can.\""@en ;

The band's sound featured his melodic, blues-based guitar lines set against Latin and African rhythms featuring percussion instruments such as timbales and congas not generally heard in rock music. Santana continued to work in these forms over the following decades. He experienced a resurgence of popularity and critical acclaim in the late 1990s. In 2003 Rolling Stone magazine listed Santana at number 20 on their list of the 100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time. He has won 10 Grammy Awards and three Latin Grammy Awards."@en ;
