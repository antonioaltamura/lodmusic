	dbo:abstract	"\"Relax\" is the debut single by Frankie Goes to Hollywood, released in the United Kingdom by ZTT Records in 1983. The song was later included on the album Welcome to the Pleasuredome (1984). Although fairly inauspicious upon initial release, \"Relax\" finally reached number one on the UK singles chart on 24 January 1984, ultimately becoming one of the most controversial and most commercially successful records of the entire decade. The single eventually sold a reported 2 million copies in the UK alone, making it the seventh best-selling single in the UK Singles Chart's history. Following the release of the group's second single, \"Two Tribes\", \"Relax\" rallied from a declining UK chart position during June 1984 to climb back up the UK charts and re-attain number-two spot behind \"Two Tribes\" at number one, representing simultaneous chart success by a single act, unprecedented since the early 1960s. Upon release in the United States in late 1984, \"Relax\" repeated its slow UK progress, reaching number 67 upon initial release, but eventually reaching number 10 in March 1985. The song won Best British Single at the 1985 Brit Awards. The song was used in the films Body Double, Police Academy, Gotcha!, Bony a klid, Zoolander, and The Proposal. It was featured in a season one episode of Miami Vice \"Little Prince\" , in The Simpsons episode \"Homer the Smithers\" and in the video game Grand Theft Auto: Vice City Stories, Saints Row: The Third, and a 2009 television advertisement for Virgin Atlantic, marking 25 years since the company's foundation."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"Two Tribes\" is the second single by Frankie Goes to Hollywood, released in the UK by ZTT Records on 4 June 1984. The song was later included on the album Welcome to the Pleasuredome. Presenting a nihilistic, gleeful lyric expressing enthusiasm for a nuclear war, it juxtaposes a relentless pounding bass line and guitar riff inspired by American funk and R&B pop with influences of Russian classical music, in an opulent arrangement produced by Trevor Horn. The recording makes extensive use of samples of the British Protect and Survive public information films on how to survive a nuclear attack. Supported by a striking advertising campaign depicting the band as members of the Red Army and a wide range of remixes, the single was a phenomenal success in the UK, immediately entering at the number one position on 10 June 1984 and staying at the top of the UK Singles Chart for nine consecutive weeks, during which time the group's previous single \"Relax\" climbed back up the charts to number two. It was the longest running number-one single in the UK of the 1980s. It has sold 1.58 million copies in the UK as of November 2012. Songwriters Johnson, Gill and O'Toole received the 1984 Ivor Novello award for Best Song Musically and Lyrically. In 2015 the song was voted by the British public as the nation's 14th favourite 1980s number one in a poll for ITV. The track was featured in The Comic Strip's movie The Supergrass and on its soundtrack, as well as in the video games Frankie Goes to Hollywood and Grand Theft Auto: Vice City. Sky Sports used the song as the intro for Super League in the late 2000s and the X Factor frequently use the song for the contestants' introductions."@en ;

While criticized at the time of release and afterward for being a song that glorifies debauchery, the lyrics (and video) make clear that the point of the song, just as Coleridge's poem, is about the dangers of this kind of lifestyle.

Primarily composed by bassist Mark Hoppus, the song concerns suicide and depression. It was inspired by a fan's suicide attempt. Hoppus said that \"Adam's Song\" is about him \"being depressed and lonely out on tour, and not really having anything to come home to\". He also said \"everybody wants to come home and have a girlfriend. And every time we\u2019d fly home, [singer/guitarist] Tom [DeLonge] and [former drummer] Scott [Raynor] always had girlfriends waiting for them at the airport, and I didn\u2019t\". Following lighthearted previous singles, \"Adam's Song\" represented a change of pace for the band, and was regarded as one of their first songs that are considered mature. It received positive reviews from contemporary music critics, who considered it one of the highlights of Enema of the State. The song peaked at number two on Billboard's Hot Modern Rock Tracks chart, and also was a top 20 hit in Canada and Germany. The song also created controversy when a person who went to Columbine High School's best friend committed suicide as the song played on repeat."@en ;

The clip was re-shot following the 9/11 attacks, with both the band and label deeming its imagery too similar to the collapse of the World Trade Center.

	dbo:abstract	"\"Watching the Wildlife\" is the seventh and last single by British pop band Frankie Goes to Hollywood. Released in early 1987, it is taken from the album Liverpool. Of the singles culled from Liverpool, \"Watching the Wildlife\" is the most radio friendly, lacking the rocky sound of Rage Hard and Warriors of the Wasteland. Indeed, when played on Radio 1 at the time, the presiding DJ stated that in his opinion it was his favourite song of theirs to date. However, the single only reached Number 28 in the UK singles chart and #23 in Germany. It is also the only one of the three Liverpool singles not to have a CD single release at that time and to this day, the mix used on the 7\" vinyl single has never appeared on a UK issued compact disc. A German release did appear in 2002 however and apparently contains the mix in question.ironically, the 1988 Record Collector magazine discography of the band contains a listing for a UK CD single, complete with catalogue number, but this was an error based on assumption. To date, no original 1987 copy has come to light, not even in promo form and can be safely disregarded as fiction. The 7\" packaging made reference to animals, with a panda and dolphin on the sleeve. The cassette single made more references to sex. To wit, the instrumental mix was dubbed \"The Condom Mix\" on the cassette single. The promotional condom that was to be distributed with each single would have stopped the single sales counting towards the UK charts as the official chart provider had introduced new rules to this effect. The single also featured a brand new track, \"The Waves\" on the b-side."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"All Night Long (All Night)\" is a hit single for American singer-songwriter Lionel Richie from 1983. Taken from his second solo album, Can't Slow Down, it combined Richie's soulful Commodores style with Caribbean influences. This new, more dance music and pop inspired approach proved popular, as the single reached number one on three Billboard charts (pop, R&B and adult contemporary). In the UK, the song was kept off the top spot by Billy Joel's \"Uptown Girl\", peaking at number two on the UK Singles Chart for three weeks. The song lyrics were written primarily in English, but Richie has admitted in at least one press interview that \"African\" lyrics in the song, such as \"Tom bo li de say de moi ya,\" and \"Jambo jumbo,\" were in fact made-up gibberish of his own invention. Richie has described these portions of the song as a \"wonderful joke,\" written when he discovered that he lacked the time to hire a translator to contribute the foreign language lyrics he wished to include in the song. The song has achieved massive popularity in the Arab World, in which Richie is well known as much as if not more than in his native U.S. The Independent has referred to Richie as \"a phenomenon\" over the past decade or so in nations such as Iraq, with \"Hello\" also achieving much success."@en ;

The song was co-written by Swift in collaboration with Liz Rose and Hillary Lindsey and produced by Nathan Chapman and Swift. \"Fearless\" was released on January 3, 2010 by Big Machine Records as the fifth and final single from Swift's second studio album of the same name (2008). Swift composed the song while traveling on tour to promote her eponymous debut album, Taylor Swift (2006). She wrote \"Fearless\" in regard to the fearlessness of falling in love and eventually titled her second studio album after the song. Musically, it contains qualities commonly found in pop rock music and, lyrically, is about a perfect first date. \"Fearless\" received acclaim from contemporary critics, many of whom complimented it for appealing to different age groups. In the United States, \"Fearless\" debuted and peaked at number 9 on the Billboard Hot 100 and was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), becoming the first single released after being certified gold by the RIAA. \"Fearless\" also entered charts in Canada and Spain. Swift performed the song in various venues, some of which were included on the Fearless Tour (2009\u201310).

It was written by the two band members, Tracey Thorn and Ben Watt, and was produced solely by Watt. It was taken as the second single off the album on 8 August 1994 by Atlantic Records and Blanco Y Negro Records. Initially it did not achieve much success, so in 1995 the song was remixed by Todd Terry and re-released, resulting in a worldwide hit, peaking near the top of the charts in many countries. Musically the song takes in multiple genres. The version from the album is a more low-tempo influenced song, while the remix version is a more up-tempo dance-pop song. Lyrically the song talks about one person missing the other because they have moved away. \"Missing\" was critically acclaimed by the majority of music critics, who praised the composition and generally considered it a highlight on the album. The release of the remixed version of \"Missing\" gave an indication of the band's future experimentation with more electronic dance music on subsequent albums."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"The Best of Both Worlds\" is a pop rock song performed by American singer\u2013songwriter and actress Miley Cyrus, performing as Hannah Montana \u2013 the alter ego of Miley Stewart \u2013 a character she played on the Disney Channel television series Hannah Montana. It was released as the lead single from the Hannah Montana soundtrack album on March 18, 2006. \"The Best of Both Worlds\" is the theme song for the television series; in the series' third season, the 2009 Movie Mix is used as the theme. A live version is available on Hannah Montana & Miley Cyrus: Best of Both Worlds Concert (2008), a karaoke version is included in the soundtrack's karaoke series (2008), and the 2009 Movie Mix is featured on Hannah Montana: The Movie soundtrack (2009). The song has elements of bubblegum pop and pop rock. Lyrically, it is a showcase of the double life lived by the series' protagonist Miley Stewart. \"The Best of Both Worlds\" is considered to be one of Cyrus' signature songs, introducing her to the music industry. The song received some critical praise, noting that the song was written well, but the concept was \"weird\". \"The Best of Both Worlds\" reached number ninety-two on the Billboard Hot 100, making the song only one of two television themes of the decade (the other being Leave It All to Me by Miranda Cosgrove) to chart on the Hot 100, and achieved average commercial success internationally. The song reached its highest international chart peak position in the Irish Singles Chart, at number seventeen. A promotional music video for the song was taken from a recording of a concert performance. Cyrus promoted the song by performing it in several venues, including during the opening act for the Cheetah Girls' The Party's Just Begun Tour and as the closing number on her own first headlining concert tour of the same name. Cyrus' performances of the song on the Best of Both Worlds Tour were as herself, but when she performed the song on television, she did so in character as Hannah Montana."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"Uptown\" was the lead single in the U.S. to Prince's third album, Dirty Mind. Beginning with a lone drum intro, the track explodes into the keyboards of the chorus. The verses feature a more prominent funk guitar. The song breaks down to a more instrumental section toward the end that mainly consists of guitar, bass and drums with an occasional keyboard riff. The minimalist style of the song is representative of most of the Dirty Mind album. The song addresses the Uptown neighborhood of Minneapolis that was the city's hang-out spot for artists."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"Uptown Funk\" (stylised as \"UpTown Funk!\") is a song recorded by British producer Mark Ronson, with vocals from American singer Bruno Mars, for Ronson's fourth studio album, Uptown Special (2015). RCA Records released the song as the album's lead single on 10 November 2014. Jeff Bhasker assisted the artists in co-writing and co-producing the track, with additional writing from Philip Lawrence. This is Mars' fourth collaboration with Ronson (following Mars' own songs \"Locked Out of Heaven\", \"Moonshine\", and \"Gorilla\") and sixth with Bhasker (after \"Talking to the Moon\", \"Young Girls\" and the three previously mentioned songs). The single received widespread critical acclaim from music critics, winning both its Grammy Award nominations for Record of the Year and Best Pop Duo/Group Performance (plus a Grammy Award in the Best Remixed Recording, Non-Classical category for remixer Dave Aud\u00E9). The song was also a global commercial success, spending fourteen consecutive weeks at number one on the US Billboard Hot 100, seven non-consecutive weeks at number one on the UK Singles Chart, and topped the charts in several other countries including Australia, Canada, France, Ireland and New Zealand. In the week of 25 January 2015, the song was streamed a record 2.34 million times in a single week in the UK, a record later surpassed by Ellie Goulding's \"Love Me like You Do\" (2.58 million streams). The latter song also beat \"Uptown Funk\" for the highest number of streams in one week worldwide, with 15.5 million. \"Uptown Funk\" also set a new record for the highest number of streams in one week in the US, with 4.8 million streams. Worldwide, the song has accumulated an estimated 15.2 million points from sales and streams. In 2015, \"Uptown Funk\" won Ronson the Brit Award for British Single of the Year. The video for \"Uptown Funk\" was also nominated for five MTV Video Music Awards in 2015, winning Best Male Video. According to Billboard magazine, the song has earned $2.7 million in publishing royalties (excluding TV and film synchronization revenue), $1.9 million of which went to the writers based on their respective publishing deals. On June 24, 2015, it was reported that Trinidad James earned over $150,000 USD in royalty earnings from Uptown Funk's interpolation. The song features heavy inspiration from the Minneapolis sound of 1980s-era funk music, having a spirit akin to works by Prince as well as Morris Day and The Time. Copyright controversies about \"Uptown Funk\" have dogged Ronson and Mars, with The Gap Band's three core members being added on as songwriters as part of a mutually settled agreement given the inspiration given to the track by \"Oops! Upside Your Head\". Serbian pop artist Viktorija has also argued that \"Uptown Funk\" infringed on her track \"Ulice Mracne Nisu Za Devojke\". The video received its billionth view on YouTube on 15 September 2015 (UTC), becoming the fourth most watched video on YouTube."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"3-Way (The Golden Rule)\" is a song recorded by American comedy music group The Lonely Island featuring American singers Justin Timberlake and Lady Gaga. It appeared as an SNL Digital Short in the May 21, 2011 episode of the sketch comedy television series Saturday Night Live (SNL), which saw Timberlake and Gaga as the host and musical guest, respectively. It was released as a single on May 24, three days after the broadcast. The R&B song was written by Andy Samberg, Akiva Schaffer, Jorma Taccone, and Timberlake while produced by The Futuristics with additional production from Asa Taccone and Ryan & Smitty. Samberg and Timberlake were nervous about presenting the idea to Gaga, who initially failed to find the humour in the song. The music video, which aired on the SNL broadcast, is a sequel to the \"Motherlover\" sketch and finds Samberg and Timberlake reprising their roles from that skit as they sing about having a threesome with Gaga. The song and sketch received positive reviews from critics who called it one of the funniest moments of the episode. \"3-Way (The Golden Rule)\" received a nomination at the 63rd Primetime Emmy Awards for Outstanding Original Music and Lyrics, but it lost to another song from the same SNL episode."@en ;

Written by Duff, Kristian Lundin, Savan Kotecha, and Carl Falk, \"All About You\" a folk pop and pop rock song, having a banjo, handclaps, and a \"heavy hand\" drum as the song's instrumentation. Lyrically, the song talks about how the protagonist is so hooked on her boyfriend that she is willing to prove her true love for him anywhere. Critics found similarities between \"All About You\" and songs from Taylor Swift and The Lumineers. The song became more successful than \"Chasing the Sun\" in Australia, where it managed to reach the top 20, the first time a Duff song had done so in nine years. Elsewhere, it had less impact, failing to enter the Billboard Hot 100 but managing to chart on the Bubbling Under Hot 100 Singles and Top 40 Mainstream. Duff released a lyric video for the song, where she appeared seducing the camera, with a succession of extreme close-ups of Duff. The official music video was directed by Declan Whitebloom and it finds the singer chasing a guy she meets at a diner, while also doing a choreography with her dancers. The singer has promoted the track with some live performances on The X Factor (Australia), Good Morning America and Live with Kelly & Michael."@en ;

The song was a huge success on the charts, reaching number one in the United States (remaining at the top for four weeks) and New Zealand, and entered the top five and the top ten in several countries.

Jackson stated that the song was influenced by a real-life story he had read about. \"Bad\" was generally well received by contemporary music critics, with some critics noting that \"Bad\" helped Jackson's image become edgier during the Bad-era. The song peaked at number one on the Billboard Hot 100, and remained at the top position of the chart for two weeks, becoming Jackson's Bad album's second number one single, and Jackson's seventh number one entry on the chart. Internationally, the song was also commercially successful, charting within the top ten in eleven countries as well as charting within the top five in the United Kingdom, France, Italy, Norwegian, Switzerland and Swedish charts. The song peaked at number one on the Netherlands and European charts. A music video for \"Bad\", directed by Martin Scorsese and co-starring one of the first appearances of yet-undiscovered Wesley Snipes, was released in late 1987. In the video, Jackson and a group of background dancers are shown doing dance routines throughout a subway station. The music video's choreographer stated that the plot and video of the background was strongly influenced by the \"Cool\" scene in West Side Story. The music video received one nomination at the Video Music Awards in 1988. \"Bad\" has been covered and parodied by multiple artists since its release as well as becoming a frequent song used during tributes to Jackson after his death in June 2009.

	dbo:abstract	"\"Because of You\" is a song recorded by American pop singer Kelly Clarkson for her second studio album, Breakaway (2004). It was written by Clarkson along with its producers David Hodges and Ben Moody. It was released on August 16, 2005 by RCA Records, as the third single from Breakaway. Clarkson originally wrote \"Because of You\" when she was 16 years old to cope with the emotional distress caused by her parents' divorce. She wanted the song to be included on her debut studio album, Thankful (2003), but her record label thought that it was not suitable to be included in the album. She then polished the song with Hodges and Moody before successfully convincing her label to include it on Breakaway. Lyrically, \"Because of You\" explores the pain of a deteriorating relationship with her father. Critics noted that the lyrics are Clarkson's ode to her father. The song begins with a piano-led melody and as it launches into the chorus, the sound of a roaring guitar becomes apparent. \"Because of You\" was praised by music critics, who complimented its expressive lyrics, creative arrangement and Clarkson's vocal prowess. It became one of Clarkson's most successful singles around the world; in the United States, it peaked at number seven on the Billboard Hot 100 and sold over 1.5 million digital downloads. It was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). Internationally, \"Because of You\" topped the charts in the Netherlands, Denmark and Switzerland as well as reaching the top ten in Australia, Austria, Canada, Germany, Belgium, Hungary, Ireland, and the United Kingdom. The song's accompanying music video was directed by Vadim Perelman. Clarkson wrote the treatment for the video herself in order to reflect the pain that she felt due to her parents' divorce. The video's plot centers on Clarkson engaging in a heated argument with her husband in front of her child before realizing that she was repeating her parents' mistake. It won in the category for Best Female Video at the 2006 MTV Video Music Awards. \"Because of You\" was performed live at numerous venues, including the My December Tour (2007) as well as the All I Ever Wanted Tour (2009). It was covered by several artists including Ronan Parke, who was a runner-up in the fifth series of Britain's Got Talent, and added to the international soundtrack of Brazilian soap opera Bel\u00EDssima. In 2007, the song was recorded by Reba McEntire as a duet with Clarkson, which was released as a lead single for McEntire's twenty-fourth studio album Reba: Duets. \"Piece by Piece\", the titular track from Clarkson's seventh studio album, serves as the canonical sequel to the \"Because of You\"."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"Bedtime Story\" is a song by American singer Madonna from her sixth studio album Bedtime Stories (1994). It was released as the third single from the album on February 13, 1995, by Maverick Records, and also appears on Madonna's compilation album GHV2 (2001). \"Bedtime Story\" was written by Bj\u00F6rk, Nellee Hooper and Marius De Vries, and was the first time the former wrote a song for Madonna's album. She re-wrote a demo of the song to the current version, which was then produced by Madonna and Nellee Hooper. A mid-tempo electronic song with acid, house, ambient and techno influences, \"Bedtime Story\" has an underlying skeletal synth melody influenced by minimal trance music. The track was a departure from Madonna's pop-R&B-based repertoire in favor of unconventional and electronic music. Lyrically it talks about the joys of the unconscious world. \"Bedtime Story\" received favorable reviews from music critics, who praised the song's hypnotic and electronic style, and deemed it an underrated song which could have had great potential. The song was a moderate international success, reaching the top ten in the United Kingdom, Italy and Australia, but missing the top 40 in United States. However, the song peaked at number one on the Hot Dance Club Songs. The music video for \"Bedtime Story\" was directed by Mark Romanek and is listed as one of the most expensive music videos of all time at a cost of $5 million ($7.76 million in 2016 dollars). It features surrealistic and new age imagery, with influences from artists such as Remedios Varo, Frida Kahlo and Leonora Carrington. The video received critical acclaim from critics and was stored in a collection at the Museum of Modern Art in New York City. \"Bedtime Story\" was performed at the 1995 Brit Awards in London with Madonna wearing a white Versace dress and long hair extensions, becoming one of the 30 best moments of the awards show history according to Marie Claire. A remixed version of the track was also used as a video interlude on her Re-Invention World Tour in 2004. \"Bedtime Story\" has left a legacy, with several critics, writers and scholars claiming that the song foreshadowed the singer's move towards electronic music in her future work. It was also written that it was part of the singer's influence in popularizing Sufism and the Mevlevi tradition in mainstream Western culture. Nevertheless, it has been described as one of her most unfulfilled potentially successful singles."@en ;

When Gillan once more returned to the band in 1992, he again refused to perform Coverdale-era songs.

The song was originally recorded by singer Leona Lewis for her third studio album, Glassheart (2012), but it was ultimately scrapped. Upon its release, \"Burn\" was met with a mixed response from music critics, who praised it as \"catchy\" and noted it as one of Goulding's most radio-friendly songs to date, while others felt it was not memorable. It earned Goulding her first number-one single on the UK Singles Chart, selling 116,857 copies in its first week and staying atop the chart for three consecutive weeks. The track attained similar success internationally, reaching the top ten in countries such as Australia, Austria, Belgium, Germany, Ireland, Italy, New Zealand and Sweden, as well as number thirteen on the Billboard Hot 100. The accompanying music video was directed by Mike Sharpe and depicts Goulding in an empty field singing and dancing with friends. Goulding promoted the single on several television shows, including The X Factor, The Ellen DeGeneres Show, The Voice and Late Show with David Letterman. \"Burn\" was nominated for British Single of the Year and British Video of the Year at the 2014 Brit Awards."@en ;

Although Candy did only slightly better than previous single \"Sometimes\" (reaching #20), it was considered a success due to it being released a large period after the album, and the fact it helped sell many copies of the said album. \"Candy\" sees Ash experiment with new territory in an emotion filled track. It samples The Walker Brothers track \"Make It Easy On Yourself\". Wheeler has said about the sample: \"It's on a song called 'Candy' that we rewrote about four times 'Cos we couldn't get it right. We tried some samples and that fitted perfectly. It lifted the song up and we danced around the studio for two days seriously drunk\". The sample on \"Candy\" is one of the reasons \"Free All Angels\" was delayed, due to legal issues. Mark Hamilton claims \"Candy\" is his favourite track on the album. Although the song featured in the band's set lists early on in the \"Free All Angels\" tour, it was quickly dropped and rarely performed since (one of those occasions being the \"Tokyo Blitz\" DVD. The song can also be found on the \"Intergalactic Sonic 7\u2033s\" hits collection. Candy also appears on the b-side of Ash's rare 2003 \"I'm On Drugs EP.

The retail single itself was only released in Australia and New Zealand. However, it was made available by import in the US and UK, and promotional singles for radio airplay were sent out to a number of countries including Canada, the UK and the US. The song was also released as a b-side to the CD2 version of the single \"All My Life\" and in the Limited Edition Bonus DVD of certain copies of the One by One album. In the UK one copy each of 6 different versions of the single were released - 3\"cd, cd, mini disc, cassette, 12\" vinyl and 7\" vinyl, they were given away as prizes. As such they have become the most highly sought after Foo Fighters collectibles. The cover art resembles the cover art of Fame. The video for the song (directed by Jesse Peretz) is loosely based on the movie, seeing the band members attending several art courses, namely, Dave Grohl studies acting, Nate Mendel studies to be a mime, Taylor Hawkins studies violin and Chris Shiflett attempts ballet. In the video Dave tries unsuccessfully to get the attention of a classmate. When it aired on MTV, the chorus was slightly altered. The unedited version goes, \"You're not the one, but you're the only one who can make me feel like this / You're not the one, but you're the only one who can make me feel like shit!\" The edited version simply repeats the first line twice so as to avoid the climactic expletive.

	dbo:abstract	"\"Untitled (How Does It Feel)\" is a song by American recording artist D'Angelo, released January 1, 2000 on Virgin Records in the United States. It was issued as a radio single in promotion of his second studio album, Voodoo (2000). Written and produced by D'Angelo and Raphael Saadiq, the song was originally composed as a tribute to musician Prince. \"Untitled (How Does It Feel)\" contains a vintage style and sound similar to that of Prince's early musical work. The song's lyrics concern a man's plea to his lover for sex. The song received generally favorable reviews from music critics and it earned D'Angelo a number of awards. \"Untitled (How Does It Feel)\" also earned notice for its controversial music video. Directed by Paul Hunter and Dominique Trenier, the video consists entirely of one shot featuring a muscular D'Angelo appearing nude and lip-synching to the track. While initial reaction from viewers was divided with praise for its sexuality and accusations of sexual objectification, the video received considerable airplay on music video networks such as MTV and BET, and it helped increase mainstream notice of D'Angelo and Voodoo. The music video for \"Untitled (How Does It Feel)\" had a considerable impact on D'Angelo's recording career, as it helped engender an image of him as a sex icon to a younger generation of fans. However, his discontent with this image led to his period of absence from the music scene following the conclusion of the supporting tour for Voodoo. The song won a Grammy Award for Best Male R&B Vocal Performance at the 43rd Grammy Awards in 2001. Rolling Stone magazine named \"Untitled (How Does It Feel)\" the fourth best single of 2000. The magazine later named it the fifty-first best song of the 2000s (decade)."@en ;

Whitfield first produced the song \u2013 a blatant anti-Vietnam War protest \u2013 with The Temptations as the original vocalists. After Motown began receiving repeated requests to release \"War\" as a single, Whitfield re-recorded the song with Edwin Starr as the vocalist, with the label deciding to withhold the Temptations' version from single release so as not to alienate their more conservative fans. Starr's version of \"War\" was a number-one hit on the Billboard Hot 100 chart in 1970, and is not only the most successful and well-known record of his career, but it is also one of the most popular protest songs ever recorded. It was one of 161 songs on the Clear Channel no-play list after September 11, 2001. The song's power was reasserted when Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band took their rendition into the U.S. Top 10 in 1986. It was also covered by Frankie Goes to Hollywood in 1984."@en ;

dbr:Another_Day_in_Paradise	rdf:type	dbo:MusicalWork ;
	dbo:abstract	"\"Another Day in Paradise\" is a protest song recorded by English drummer and singer Phil Collins. Produced by Collins along with Hugh Padgham, it was released as the first single from his number-one album ...But Seriously (1989). As with his song for Genesis, \"Man on the Corner\", the track has as its subject the problem of homelessness; as such, the song was a substantial departure from the dance-pop music of his previous album, No Jacket Required (1985). Collins sings the song from a third-person perspective, observing as a man crosses the street to ignore a homeless woman, and he implores listeners not to turn a blind eye to homelessness because, by drawing a religious allusion, \"it's just another day for you and me in paradise\". Collins also appeals directly to God by singing: \"Oh Lord, is there nothing more anybody can do? Oh Lord, there must be something you can say?\" The song was Collins' seventh and final Billboard Hot 100 number-one single, and the first number-one single of the 1990s. It was also a worldwide success, eventually becoming one of the most successful songs of his solo career. It won Collins and Padgham the Grammy Award for Record of the Year at the 1991 awards ceremony, while it was also nominated for Song of the Year, Best Pop Vocal Performance, Male and Best Music Video, Short Form. \"Another Day in Paradise\" also won an award for Best British Single at the 1990 BRIT Awards. Despite the awards gained following its release, the song also generated controversy over its subject matter and has received a largely negative reaction from music critics. Collins and David Crosby's live performance of the song at the 1991 Grammy Awards was released on the 1994 album Grammy's Greatest Moments Volume I. In 2009, Collins's version was listed at 86th on Billboard's Greatest Songs of All Time. \"Another Day in Paradise\" has since been covered by several artists, including Brandy, and her brother Ray J, Jam Tronik, Axxis, Novecento, and Hank Marvin."@en ;

Crowley, obtained writing credits. Musically, \"Come Back to Me\" is a pop and R&B song with an urban beat, string instruments and hand claps. Critical reception of \"Come Back to Me\" was generally positive; some critics praised the inclusion of the Player sample and named the song one of the album's best tracks. However, it was criticized for holding a manufactured and overproduced sound. It performed moderately in the United States, where it peaked at number 55 on the Billboard Hot 100 and number 18 on the Pop Songs chart. It fared better internationally as it peaked in the top 20 in several countries, including France, Italy, New Zealand and Spain. The accompanying music video was directed by Chris Applebaum and features Hudgens dancing in front of colorful backdrops and hanging out with her friends."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"Cool for Cats\" was the second single released from Squeeze's Cool for Cats album. It featured a comparatively rare lead vocal performance from cockney-accented Squeeze lyricist Chris Difford, one of only two occasions he sang lead on a Squeeze single A-side (the other was 1989's \"Love Circles\"). The song, slightly edited from the album track, peaked at No. 2 on the UK Singles Chart, making it one of the band's biggest hits. The title phrase is a reference to the 1950s/60s UK TV series Cool for Cats, the first British series to regularly feature rock 'n' roll music acts. In 1992, thirteen years after its initial release, the track \"Cool for Cats\" was used in a British TV commercial for milk. The song was then re-issued in the UK, where it charted at No. 62. The song is also a playable track on Rock Band 2. There is a persistent rumour that one of the two women dancing and singing the distinctive \"Cool for Cats\" chorus in the video to the song is Michelle Collins, who later found fame as Cindy Beale in BBC TV's EastEnders. However, during a radio interview in 2009, Collins said this was untrue (contradicting a 2002 interview)."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"God Only Knows\" is a song written by Brian Wilson and Tony Asher for American rock band The Beach Boys, released in May 1966 as the eighth track on the group's album Pet Sounds. Two months later, it was released as the B-side of \"Wouldn't It Be Nice\" in the United States. In other countries, \"God Only Knows\" was the single's A-side. According to historian John Robert Greene, \"God Only Knows\" led to the reinvention of the popular love song. The song names God in its title and lyrics, unusual for a pop single of its time, as Asher recalled: \"Unless you were Kate Smith and you were singing 'God Bless America', no one [in 1966] thought you could say 'God' in a song.\" The sentiments expressed in its lyric were not specific to any God, and could be addressed to any higher force, being a song about moving forward after loss. Wilson later explained that his and Asher's intention was to create the feeling of \"being blind but in being blind, you can see more\". Sung by his younger brother Carl Wilson, the Beach Boys' recording was produced and arranged by Brian using an unorthodox selection of instruments, including French horn, accordions, sleigh bell, harpsichord, and a quartet of violas and cellos heard throughout the piece in counterpoint. The musical structure has been variously cited for its harmonic complexity, inspiring tension through its disuse of authentic cadences and a definite key signature. Its closing section features perpetual rounds, a device that was not normally heard in popular music of the era. \"God Only Knows\" was voted 25 in Rolling Stone magazine's 500 Greatest Songs of All Time, the second of seven Beach Boys songs to feature (the first being \"Good Vibrations\" at 6), and was ranked by Pitchfork Media as the greatest song of the 1960s. The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame included it as one of \"500 Songs That Shaped Rock and Roll\"."@en ;

Although written by lead singer Billie Joe Armstrong before the release of the band's third album Dookie (1994), the song was not released until Green Day's fifth album, Nimrod (1997), and was the second single released from that album. An alternative version (in a different key, with a faster tempo and sparer arrangement) did appear as a B-side to the 1995 German import single for \"Brain Stew/Jaded\". Although it was not issued as a physical single at the time of its original release in the United States, \"Good Riddance (Time of Your Life)\" later went on to sell over 2.6 million copies as a digital download in the country.

	dbo:abstract	"\"I'll Be There for You/You're All I Need to Get By\" is a Grammy Award-winning duet performed by rapper Method Man and R&B singer Mary J. Blige. The song is a remix of Method Man's \"All I Need\" (which appears on his 1994 debut album Tical), with an interpolation of Marvin Gaye and Tammi Terrell's 1968 hit, \"You're All I Need to Get By\", with Mary J. Blige singing the choruses, and backing vocals. Another version of the song was released, entitled \"Puff Daddy Mix,\" which was produced by Sean Combs. The song contains a new instrumental which includes a repeated sample (\"Lie together, cry together/I swear to God I hope we fuckin' die together\") from The Notorious B.I.G.'s \"Me & My Bitch\". Another remix version, titled \"Razor Sharp Mix\" was produced by RZA. The song sold 800,000 copies and was certified platinum by the RIAA. The song peaked at #3 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart on June 3, 1995, and #1 on the R&B singles chart in the May 20, 1995 issue of Billboard Magazine - a position it held for three weeks. The song also ended up winning the duo the Grammy Award for Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group in 1996. \"I'll Be There for You/You're All I Need to Get By\" appears on Radio 1 Established 1967, a compilation album celebrating the 40th anniversary of BBC Radio 1. In 2008, it was ranked #44 on VH1's \"100 Greatest Songs of Hip Hop\" list. In 2009, Method Man and Mary J. Blige performed the song together at VH1's 6th Annual Hip Hop Honors ceremony. The song is often cited as the hybrid of what's now known as \"Thug-Loved\" duets. In 2012, Complex ranked the song #1 on its list of \"The 25 Best Hip-Hop Love Songs.\" In a July 2012 interview with Complex magazine, Jean Claude \"Poke\" Olivier- one-half of the production team the Trackmasters- claimed they were the actual producers behind the Sean \"Puffy\" Combs remix, but were never properly credited for it. Instead, they were only credited as session musicians for programming the drums while Combs was credited as the producer."@en ;

A love song, Neil Tennant has also hinted that it can also be interpreted as commentary on the then fraught relationship between British Prime Minister Tony Blair and New Labour architect Peter Mandelson after the latter had to resign again from the British Cabinet after a second major scandal he was involved in. The song, like its parent album, also stands in contrast to the Pet Shop Boys' predominantly electronic catalogue of songs, primarily having a pop/soft rock feel, opening with a piano, and featuring rock-style guitar and drums (even if synthesised). There is only sparse actual synthesised sounds in the song. The video, which portrays young actors in a New York artist's studio and does not draw on the song's political subtext, was directed by Bruce Weber, who had worked with the band before, most notably for their video for the 1990 single \"Being Boring\".

	dbo:abstract	"\"Layla\" is a song written by Eric Clapton and Jim Gordon, originally released by their blues rock band Derek and the Dominos, as the thirteenth track from their album Layla and Other Assorted Love Songs (November 1970). Its famously contrasting movements were composed separately by Clapton and Gordon. The song was inspired by a love story that originated as a poem The Story of Layla and Majnun in 5th-Century Arabia, later was adopted by the Persian poet Nizami Ganjavi, a copy of which Ian Dallas had given to Clapton. The book moved Clapton profoundly, as it was the tale of a young man who fell hopelessly in love with a beautiful, unavailable woman and who went crazy because he could not marry her. In his autobiography, Clapton states, \"Ian Dallas told me the tale of Layla and Manjun [sic], a romantic Persian love story in which a young man, Manjun [sic], falls passionately in love with the beautiful Layla, but is forbidden by her father to marry her and goes crazy with desire.\" The song was further inspired by Clapton's then unrequited love for Pattie Boyd, the wife of his friend and fellow musician George Harrison of The Beatles. \"Layla\" was unsuccessful on its initial release. The song has since experienced great critical and popular acclaim, and is often hailed as being among the greatest rock songs of all time. Two versions have achieved chart success, the first in 1972 and the second (without the piano coda) 20 years later as an acoustic Unplugged performance by Clapton. In 2004, \"Layla\" was ranked number 27 on Rolling Stone's list of \"The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time\", and the acoustic version won the 1993 Grammy Award for Best Rock Song."@en ;

The original demo version of the song was written by Jackson and Greg Phillinganes. Quincy Jones passed on the song itself but liked the title and, with James Ingram, fashioned a totally new song with that title. The demo version is featured on The Ultimate Collection. \"P.Y.T. (Pretty Young Thing)\" was released on September 19, 1983, as the penultimate single from Thriller. The single charted at number 10 on the Billboard Hot 100 and no. 46 on the Hot Black Singles chart, becoming the sixth Top 10 hit from the album. In the UK, the song reached a peak position of 11. The single was most successful in Belgium, charting within the Top 10 at no. 6. The song has been covered and sampled by numerous artists, including Monica, Justin Guarini and Kanye West. The original demo was also remixed by The Black Eyed Peas singer will.i.am for Thriller 25. \"P.Y.T. (Pretty Young Thing)\" was never performed live by Jackson.

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Radar_(song)>	rdf:type	dbo:MusicalWork ;
	dbo:abstract	"\"Radar\" is a song recorded by American singer Britney Spears for her fifth studio album, Blackout (2007). It was written and produced by Bloodshy & Avant and The Clutch, with additional writing from Henrik Jonback, as a record that did not relate to any of her personal problems at the time. The recording sessions took place the day after Spears filed for divorce from Kevin Federline, and members of The Clutch claimed to be surprised by her work ethic. \"Radar\" was originally planned to be released as the third single from Blackout, but \"Break the Ice\" was chosen instead. The song was then planned as the fourth single, but the release was cancelled as Spears began recording her sixth studio album, Circus (2008). \"Radar\" was later included as a bonus track on Circus, and released as the fourth and final single from the album on June 22, 2009 by Jive Records. Musically, \"Radar\" is an electropop and synthpop song, that runs through a midtempo dance groove. Spears' vocals are auto tuned and accompanied by sonar pulses and a heavy usage of distorted synthesizers. The lyrics refer to an attraction between the protagonist and a man, while she wonders if he knows what she is feeling. \"Radar\" received mixed reviews from critics; some called it one of the highlights of Blackout, while others felt that it was over-produced and also criticized her vocals for being processed. In July 2008, \"Radar\" charted in the top forty of Ireland and New Zealand, and inside the top-ten in Sweden. After it was released as a single from Circus, the track performed poorly on the charts and did not manage to enter the top forty in most countries. However, it became her 21st hit on the US Billboard's Pop Songs chart, the most for any artist of the decade. The single's accompanying music video was directed by Dave Meyers, and pays tribute to the music video of Madonna's \"Take a Bow\" (1994). In the video, Spears is an aristocratic woman involved in a love triangle with two men who are polo players. The video received mixed reviews from critics, who complimented the fashion but called the idea unoriginal. \"Radar\" was performed by Spears at The Circus Starring Britney Spears (2009), with the accompanying dance routine featuring her pole dancing."@en ;

The song's production was met with critical acclaim, and various critics named it the song of the summer, while The Guardian and Xtra! highlighted it as one of the best songs of 2007.

	dbo:abstract	"\"Stronger\" is a song by American hip hop recording artist Kanye West, released as the second single from his third studio album, Graduation (2007). The production was handled by West, with an extended outro co-produced with Mike Dean. The composition is electronic in nature, employing synthesizers as its prominent instrument. For the track, West utilizes a vocoder-affected vocal sample of \"Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger\" by French house duo Daft Punk. On \"Stronger,\" West speaks about the resolve that comes when one is faced with adversity, with lyrics at the song's refrain that paraphrase Friedrich Nietzsche's famous dictum, \"What does not kill him, makes him stronger.\" West also describes \"Stronger\" as an \"emancipation\", using the track to vent his frustration over mistakes he made in the past year. The song's production process was arduous, with West and his team mixing the track reportedly over 75 times, including after its release as a single. Although he worked with eight different audio engineers and eleven different mix engineers around the world for the track, West still felt dissatisfied with the results and decided to enlist the aid of record producer Timbaland in redoing its drum programming prior to the release of Graduation. West felt \"Stronger\" paled in comparison to the sampled original, but Daft Punk were delighted by the song, leading to future collaborations. The single's music video was directed by Hype Williams, features sci-fi imagery based on the 1988 anime film Akira, and was shot largely in Tokyo, Japan. Kanye West's use of shutter shades in the music video became a signature of his in the late 2000s. Released as a single on July 31, 2007, \"Stronger\" would top the Billboard Hot 100 several weeks later, becoming West's third number-one single. It was a top ten single in ten countries, topping the charts in four of them, including the United Kingdom. The song won a Grammy Award for Best Rap Solo Performance at the 50th Grammy Awards, and was named as one of the best songs of the year by Rolling Stone and Spin. Its popularity has been accredited to not only encouraging other hip-hop artists to incorporate house and electronica elements into their music, but also for playing a part in the revival of disco and electro-infused music in the ensuing years. \"Stronger\" has since sold five million copies in the United States."@en ;

The Sugababes wrote the song in collaboration with Jony Rockstar, Marius de Vries and Felix Howard; it was inspired by group member Heidi Range's experience of being separated from her family and friends. \"Stronger\" is a downtempo pop and R&B ballad with a self-empowerment theme. It is the third single from Angels with Dirty Faces, and was released as a double A-side with the album's title track. The song received mixed reviews from critics, who were ambivalent towards its composition. \"Stronger\" charted at number seven on the UK Singles Chart and reached the top ten on the singles charts in the Netherlands and Norway. It peaked in the top forty in Australia and New Zealand, and many European countries. Alison Murray directed the song's music video, which was filmed at a swimming pool in London and portrays each group member as a different persona. The single was performed by the Sugababes at the Edinburgh 50,000 \u2013 The Final Push concert in July 2005, and was included in the set lists for their tours in support of Three, Overloaded: The Singles Collection and Change.

	dbo:abstract	"\"Surf's Up\" is a song written by Brian Wilson and Van Dyke Parks for American rock band the Beach Boys. Its title is an ironic nod to the group's earlier associations with surf music; nothing in the song is about surfing. Through its stream of consciousness lyric, the song details a man who experiences a spiritual awakening, resigns himself to God and the joy of enlightenment, and prophesies an optimistic hope for those who can capture the innocence of youth. From 1966 to 1967, \"Surf's Up\" was partially recorded for the group's unfinished studio album Smile before being shelved indefinitely. After Wilson was filmed performing the song for a 1967 television documentary covering the 1960s rock revolution, the composition acquired relative mystique. In 1971, the original studio recording was completed and served as the title track for the group's twenty-second official album. It was also released as a single, serving as the A-side to \"Don't Go Near the Water\", which did not chart. In 1967 it was acknowledged by classically-trained clarinetist David Oppenheim who called it \"too complex to get the first time around...'Surf's Up' is one aspect of new things happening in pop music today. As such, it is a symbol of the change many of these young musicians see in our future.\" Musicologist Philip Lambert named the song \"the soul of Smile\" for being the \"sum total of its creators' most profound artistic visions\" with its \"perfect marriage of an eloquent lyric with music of commensurate power and depth.\" In 2011, MOJO staff members voted it the greatest Beach Boys song."@en ;

Sung as a duet with Spinners main lead singer Bobby Smith and the Spinners, who were one of the most popular groups of the decade, the song became Warwick's first ever single to reach number one on the Billboard Hot 100 and also became her highest-charting R&B record reaching number two on that chart. It was also the first number-one pop hit for the Spinners.

The song, written by Furtado herself, and Brian West, was released as the second single from the album in February 2004. Lyrically, Furtado said the song \"is about the reality of love. My energy used to just go everywhere, but now I'm more grounded because I've found true love. The idea here is that, yeah, sometimes life sucks. But life is only so long, and somebody can come along who makes you want to be a better person. You just have to roll with the punches. So \"Try\" is not a happy-go-lucky song. It has a strange arrangement because the chorus happens only twice, and the end is improvisational. It's like one of those epic power ballads.\" The Los Angeles Times said of \"Try\", \"Her unfettered enthusiasm wins out as she sings of passion for life\"."@en ;

A re-recorded version of the song appears on their debut album To Lose My Life.... The most obvious difference is that the album version does not feature the high-pitched backing vocals by bassist Charles Cave during the final chorus. The single's B-side, \"You Still Love Him\", shares its chorus melody and lyrics with the song \"One Night Friend\". \"One Night Friend\" had previously been recorded by the band under their previous incarnation, Fear of Flying. During their 2009 European tour, White Lies began playing \"You Still Love Him\" live for the first time. \"Unfinished Business\" was written in under fifteen minutes, and directly led to the band's later name change. Lyrically the song concerns a man trying to reconnect with his estranged girlfriend, only to realise that she has already killed him, and he is in fact now a ghost. He nevertheless still tries to \"dance like we used to\" before the \"light in the distance\" comes for him. \"Unfinished Business\" was notably covered by Mumford and Sons on Australian radio station Triple J on their segment 'Like a Version' and features on the sixth album of the segment's cover versions, alongside artists such as Regina Spektor, OK Go & Alexisonfire."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"What's Going On\" is a song by American recording artist Marvin Gaye, released in 1971 on the Motown subsidiary Tamla. Originally inspired by a police brutality incident witnessed by Renaldo \"Obie\" Benson, the song was composed by Benson, Al Cleveland and Gaye and produced by Gaye himself. The song, which focused on major seventh and minor seventh chords, and was oriented in sounds by jazz, gospel and classical music orchestration, was mainly viewed as a meditation on the troubles and problems of the world, proving to be a timely and relatable release, and marked Gaye's departure from the Motown Sound towards more personal material. Later topping the Hot Soul Singles chart for five weeks and crossing over to number two on the Billboard Hot 100, it would sell over two million copies, becoming Gaye's second-most successful Motown song to date. The song topped Detroit's Metro Times list of the 100 Greatest Detroit Songs of All Time, and in 2004, Rolling Stone magazine ranked it the fourth-greatest song of all time; in its updated 2011 list, the song remained at that position. It is included in the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame's 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll list, along with two other songs by the singer. It was also listed at number fourteen on VH-1's 100 Greatest Rock Songs."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"Naughty Girl\" is a song recorded by American singer Beyonc\u00E9 from her debut studio album, Dangerously in Love (2003). It was written by Robert Waller, Angela Beyinc\u00E9, Scott Storch and Beyonc\u00E9, and produced by the Storch and Beyinc\u00E9. The song was released by Columbia Records as the fourth and final single from the album to US radios on March 14, 2004, and was available as a physical release the next month. An official remix featuring Lil' Kim was released in the following month, as well. Musically, \"Naughty Girl\" is an R&B and disco song that interpolates from the Donna Summer's song, \"Love to Love You Baby\" (1975). Influenced by Arabic music, dancehall and reggae, the song contains lyrics that reference to a celebration of sexual lust and conquest, leading up to a desire for a one-night stand. \"Naughty Girl\" was received with positive reviews by music critics, who praised Beyonc\u00E9's assertive vocals and the song's sensual vibe. However, opinions about how convincingly Beyonc\u00E9 was able to portray a naughty girl were polarized. The song was nominated in the category Best R&B/Soul Single by a Female Artist at the 2005 Soul Train Music Awards. \"Naughty Girl\" peaked at number three on the US Billboard Hot 100, becoming Beyonc\u00E9's fourth consecutive release from the album to reach the top five on that chart. The single reached the top ten in New Zealand, Australia, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom. \"Naughty Girl\" was certified gold by the American and Australian trade associations of record producers. It was also certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of New Zealand. The single's accompanying music video was directed by Jake Nava and was inspired by the dancing of Cyd Charisse and Fred Astaire in the 1953 musical comedy film, The Band Wagon. In it, Beyonc\u00E9 flirtatiously and seductively dances with R&B singer Usher to portray a naughty girl. The video received four nominations at the 2004 MTV Video Music Awards and eventually won the Best Female Video accolade. The song was included on Beyonc\u00E9's set lists on her tours. The American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers (ASCAP) recognized \"Naughty Girl\" as one of the most performed songs of 2005 at the ASCAP Pop Music Awards. \"Naughty Girl\" has been covered by singer-songwriter Roesy and band Richard Cheese and Lounge Against the Machine."@en ;

Before this time, most non-Latino Americans had never heard of Martin until what CNN reported was a show-stopping performance of \"La Copa de la Vida\" at the 41st Grammy Awards show, which became a catalyst in bringing Latin pop to the forefront of the U.S. music scene. \"Livin' la Vida Loca\" sold over 8 million copies, making it one of the best selling singles of all time.

	dbo:abstract	"\"Grand Theft Autumn/Where Is Your Boy\" is a song by American rock band Fall Out Boy and the second single released from their 2003 album, Take This to Your Grave. The breakthrough mainstream success that the band received with their follow-up album From Under the Cork Tree (2005) strengthened the song's popularity and helped it reach No. 84 on the now-defunct US Billboard Pop 100 chart. It has also drawn in a large amount of digital downloads. The single was released on yellow vinyl, a split 7\" with My Awesome Compilation. An acoustic version of the song was released on the 2004 EP My Heart Will Always Be the B-Side to My Tongue, and a new dance remix (Millennium version) of the song was included in the 2005 re-release of Take This to Your Grave: Director's Cut. The lyrics deal with jealousy and unrequited love. Both Patrick Stump and Pete Wentz disliked \"Grand Theft Autumn/Where Is Your Boy\" during the recording process; Stump particularly disliked the a cappella opening, which was producer Sean O'Keefe's idea. The title of the song was taken, without permission, from a Braid song, and subsequently, the name of the record label started by Braid members, Roy Ewing and Todd Bell. \"Grand Theft Autumn\" was referenced, among many other Fall Out Boy songs, on their 2008 album Folie \u00E0 Deux track \"What a Catch, Donnie\", featuring Gabe Saporta of Cobra Starship singing the chorus of the song.

	dbo:abstract	"\"U and Dat\" is the second single from E-40's album My Ghetto Report Card. The song features T-Pain and Kandi Burruss, and it was produced by Lil Jon. A remix was released in early August with Juelz Santana, Snoop Dogg, and Lil' Flip. It was featured on an Amp'd mobile commercial. Although it is considered a West coast hip hop song, the song's beat structure incorporates typical southern hip hop snares as well as Lil Jon's signature crunk synths and whistles. The catchy, up-tempo and club oriented southern hip hop track allowed the song to peak at #13 of the U.S. Billboard Hot 100. The track is credited to have popularized the use of T-Pain as a hook singer on hip hop tracks."@en ;

The song is best known in a recording by The Everly Brothers, issued by Cadence Records as catalog number 1337. The Everly Brothers record reached number one on the Billboard Pop chart and the Cash Box Best Selling Records chart, despite having been banned from Boston radio stations for lyrics that, at the time, were considered suggestive, according to a 1986 interview with Don Everly. \"Wake Up Little Susie\" also spent seven weeks atop the Billboard country chart and got to number two on the UK Singles Chart. The song was ranked at #318 on the Rolling Stone magazine's list of The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time. In an appearance on The Oprah Winfrey Show during the 2000 U.S. presidential election, then-Governor George W. Bush named \"Wake Up Little Susie\" as his favorite song. \"Wake Up Little Susie\" was the first single filmmaker David Lynch bought."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"Wolf at the Door\" is a song performed and composed by English alternative rock band Keane and was the second single they released, originally intended only as a promo item with only fifty copies made, becoming the rarest Keane item in existence.[citation needed] Recording started on 28 October 2000 and finished in May 2001 even though the record was originally planned to be released before 2001. The CD single was released by the band's own record label, Zoomorphic, in June 2001 and was sold at the pubs where Keane used to play. All fifty copies were handmade and recorded on CD-Rs. Because of its limited production it is one of the most desired collectors' items amongst Keane fans, and has been known to sell for around \u00A31000 on eBay. Its status as a rarity is such that, allegedly, no member of the band is in possession of a copy. The single features a re-recording of their previous single \"Call Me What You Like\", as well as an early version of \"She Has No Time\", which later would appear on Hopes and Fears, the band's debut album. Shortly after this record was released, guitarist Dominic Scott left the band, and was Keane's last release with a guitar as part of their instrumentation until the 2007 cover b-side \"She Sells Sanctuary\"."@en ;

Ei wrote the lyrics while walking home from a Japanese student demonstration protesting continued US Army presence, expressing his frustration at the failed efforts. In Anglophone countries, it is best known under the alternative title \"Sukiyaki,\" a term with no relevance to the song's lyrics. The song reached the top of the Billboard Hot 100 charts in the United States in 1963, and remains to date the only Japanese-language song ever to have done so. In addition, it was and still is one of the few non-Indo-European languages' songs to have reached the top of the US charts. It is one of the best-selling singles of all time, having sold over 13 million copies worldwide. The original Kyu Sakamoto recording also went to number eighteen on the R&B chart. In addition, the single spent five weeks at number one on the Middle of the Road charts. The recording was originally released in Japan by Toshiba in 1961. It topped the Popular Music Selling Record chart in the Japanese magazine Music Life for three months, and was ranked as the number one song of 1961 in Japan. Well-known English-language cover versions with altogether different lyrics include \"My First Lonely Night\" by Jewel Akens in 1966 and \"Sukiyaki\" by A Taste of Honey in 1980. The song has also been recorded in other languages."@en ;

At a live performance, Sarah explains the song as being \"basically about the fact that we all... have insecurities to hide, and we often do that by putting on a facade.\" She also goes on to say that \"unfortunately, if we just be who we are, that's usually the more attractive and beautiful thing\". A fan favourite, the song was an immediate Top-40, Soft AC, and Hot AC hit which paved the grounds for her future songs \"Sweet Surrender\", \"Adia\", and \"Angel\", all from the Surfacing album. It peaked at #13 on the Billboard Hot 100. The album version of \"Building a Mystery,\" and the live albums \"Afterglow Live\" and \"Mirrorball\" contain the line, \"A beautiful fucked-up man.\" The radio version replaces this line with \"A beautiful but strange man\" or the original lyric garbled beyond recognition, and during performances on radio or television, Sarah sings the line \"A beautiful messed-up man.\" The video features a man, described as McLachlan's boyfriend, taking points of light from wherever he travels and stitching some sort of garment. When McLachlan investigates in his absence, she finds that he has been assembling a skirt so decorated as to be lit with stars. Mark Seliger and Fred Woodward jointly directed the video, but both later disowned it with the Allen Smithee credit. The song was her biggest chart hit in Canada, spending eight weeks at #1 on the RPM charts and ranking as the #1 single of the year in the magazine's year end chart. It won the Juno Award for Single of the Year in 1998. The track also made McLachlan the recipient of the Grammy Award for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance at the Grammy Awards of 1998, beating Mariah Carey, Shawn Colvin, Paula Cole and Jewel.

dbr:Me_Against_the_Music	rdf:type	dbo:MusicalWork ;
	dbo:abstract	"\"Me Against the Music\" is a song recorded by American singers Britney Spears and Madonna for Spears' fourth studio album, In the Zone (2003). It was written by Spears, Madonna, Christopher \"Tricky\" Stewart, Thabiso \"Tab\" Nikhereanye, Penelope Magnet, Terius Nash and Gary O'Brien. The song was released on October 14, 2003, by Jive Records, as the lead single of In the Zone. After bonding with Spears during a night in New York City, Stewart and Magnet started working on the song for her. During rehearsals for the 2003 MTV Video Music Awards, Spears played Madonna the track and asked her to do the song with her. \"Me Against the Music\" contains influences of hip hop and usage of funk guitars. Spears and Madonna trade lines during the verses, and Madonna sings the bridge. Lyrically, the song talks about battling the music and the pleasures of letting go on the dancefloor. The song received generally mixed reviews from music critics. Some felt it was a strong dance track of In the Zone, while others referred to it as lackluster and disappointing. The song was a commercial success, peaking atop of the charts in countries such as Australia, Denmark, Hungary, Ireland and Spain, as well as the European Hot 100 Singles. It also peaked at number two in Canada, Italy, Norway and the United Kingdom, and inside the top five in many other nations. The song won the \"Hot Dance Single of the Year\" accolade at the 2004 Billboard Music Awards. The accompanying music video for \"Me Against the Music\" shows Spears and Madonna playing opposites in a nightclub. A cat-and-mouse chase ensues, and Spears finds Madonna in the end, only for the latter to disappear before they kiss. The video received positive reviews from critics, who noted it as symbolic of the sexual roles between the women. Spears has performed the song in a number of live appearances including the 2003 NFL Kickoff Live, Saturday Night Live, 2003 American Music Awards and TRL. She has also performed remixed versions with elements of bhangra music at The Onyx Hotel Tour (2004) and The Circus Starring Britney Spears (2009). Spears is currently performing the song on her Las Vegas residency show Britney: Piece of Me. \"Me Against the Music\" has been sampled by Justice, while the music video was recreated by television series Glee and included an appearance by Spears."@en ;

dbr:My_Prerogative	rdf:type	dbo:MusicalWork ;
	dbo:abstract	"\"My Prerogative\" is a song by American singer Bobby Brown from his second solo studio album, Don't Be Cruel. It was released on October 11, 1988 as the second single from the album. After recording sessions for the album were completed, Brown and producer Gene Griffin travelled to New York City, since he felt something was \"missing\" from the record. \"My Prerogative\" was written by Brown as a response to the criticism he received for his departure from New Edition. He explained the song was about making decisions in one's life and not caring about other people's judgment. \"My Prerogative\" is often considered a new jack swing anthem, and contains many elements from Teddy Riley productions due to his involvement as one of the song's session musicians. The song was positively received by critics and was nominated for a Grammy Award in the category of Best R&B Urban Contemporary Single. It was also commercially successful, reaching number one in Billboard's Hot 100 and Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs charts. \"My Prerogative\" also reached top ten positions in many countries, such as Ireland, New Zealand, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom. The music video for the song features Brown performing the song on stage with his band and dancers. The song was also performed at most of his concerts, usually as the last song of the set list. On the February 4, 1989 performance at Madison Square Garden, he was joined on stage by many popular rap artists and producers of the time. \"My Prerogative\" has been covered and sampled by a number of artists from different genres, including Britney Spears. She released her cover in her first compilation, Greatest Hits: My Prerogative (2004). The cover was produced by Bloodshy & Avant and was noted for aptly referring to Spears's relationship with the media at the time. Although the song only appeared in component charts in the United States, Spears's cover surpassed Brown's version worldwide, peaking at the top of the charts in Finland, Ireland, Italy and Norway and reaching the top ten in another fourteen countries."@en ;

dbr:Other_Side_of_the_World	rdf:type	dbo:MusicalWork ;
	dbo:abstract	"\"Other Side of the World\" is a song by British singer-songwriter KT Tunstall and is the opening track on her debut album, Eye to the Telescope. It was released 9 May 2005 as the second single from that album and became her top twenty hit on the UK Singles Chart, peaking at number thirteen (see 2005 in British music). By mid-September 2006, it was released in the United States and Canada as the third and final single from the album, and the Music Video, which used the radio version of the song, was in rotation on MuchMoreMusic in Canada. It is reportedly one of KT Tunstall's favourite songs. The song is about long distance relationships and the problems they have and how they seldom work out. It is based on a true story of two friends Tunstall had who were a couple but one lived in Scotland and the other in the United States. As an April Fool's Day joke her manager told her that another artist was about to release a song almost identical to \"Other Side of the World\", so they would have to shelve Tunstall's release. As she was proud of her song and fell for the prank, Tunstall joked that she would have to do something major to get him back next year. In April and May 2007 it began to receive airplay on US radio. By early May 2007 the video played on MTV in the morning hours, and by the end of the month it played on VH1 as well."@en ;

The single's B-side contains \"Modern Girls & Old Fashion Men\", where lead singer Julian Casablancas duets with Regina Spektor.

In October 2011, NME placed it at number 129 on its list \"150 Best Tracks of the Past 15 Years\". Although it is not one of the band's highest charting singles since the song peaked at #19 on the Modern Rock Tracks chart, it is still one of the band's most popular singles. The song appeared in the video games Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock and Rock Band as well as the 2014 Volkswagen Golf Family ad.

	dbo:abstract	"\"Stop Crying Your Heart Out\" is a song by the English rock band Oasis. The song was written by Noel Gallagher and produced by Oasis. It was released on 17 May 2002 as the second single from the band's fifth studio album, Heathen Chemistry (2002). Liam Gallagher is the lead vocalist on the track, with Noel on backing vocals. The power ballad was heavily compared to the band's previous single \"Slide Away\", while its hook is reminiscent of their song \"Don't Look Back in Anger\". It garnered mixed reviews from music critics. While some praised Noel's ability to lighten the mood of his target audience, others felt that the song was disappointing and forgettable. \"Stop Crying Your Heart Out\" debuted and peaked at number two on the UK Singles Chart and reached a peak of number six on the UK Indie Chart. It peaked at number one in Italy, and reached the top-twenty in Belgium, Denmark, Finland and Norway. \"Stop Crying Your Heart Out\" was certified silver by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) on 12 July 2002, denoting shipments of over 200,000 copies. British singer-songwriter Leona Lewis recorded a cover version for her second studio album Echo (2009).

dbr:We_Are_the_Pigs	rdf:type	dbo:MusicalWork ;
	dbo:abstract	"\"We Are the Pigs\" is the first single from the album Dog Man Star by Suede, released on 12 September 1994, on Nude Records. The single announced the darker tone that the band had taken for Dog Man Star, that contrasted heavily with their debut. The challenging sound on the single was not characteristic of the popular Britpop bands of the time. That along with the departure of guitarist Bernard Butler during its release, contributed to its relatively poor charting, although still managing a #18 peak. The video, directed by David and Raphael Vital-Durand, features a grim, Nineteen Eighty-Four-like setting. It was initially banned by some TV stations including MTV for being too violent. The video features car burnings, cross burnings, and various violence to humans. Also notable, the video features the video debut of new guitarist Richard Oakes. The b-side \"Killing of a Flashboy\" also became a staple of Suede's live set list and became one of their most popular songs. It is also available on the B-sides album Sci-Fi Lullabies. Pitchfork Media placed \"We Are the Pigs\" at #169 on their list of the Top 200 Tracks of the 1990s."@en ;

dbr:A_Little_Respect	rdf:type	dbo:MusicalWork ;
	dbo:abstract	"\"A Little Respect\" is a song written and recorded by British synthpop duo Erasure, released in September 1988 as their tenth single. It was issued as the third European (and second American) single from their album The Innocents. Known as one of their signature songs, \"A Little Respect\" continued Erasure's success on the UK Singles Chart, where it hit number four to become the band's fifth Top 10 single. It was also Erasure's second consecutive Top 20 hit on the Billboard Hot 100, where it climbed to number 14, and hit number two on the U.S. Hot Dance Club Songs chart. In the U.K. Mark Saunders and Phil Legg provided the remixes, for the U.S. the remixes were made by Justin Strauss. Written by Erasure members Vince Clarke and Andy Bell, the heavily synthesized instrumentation is accentuated by acoustic guitar and Bell's use of falsetto in the chorus. The lyrics are an empowering plea to a lover to show compassion and respect. An acoustic version of \"A Little Respect\" is featured on the Moon & the Sky Plus EP in the UK. The song was remixed in 2006 by Jaded Alliance for the Future Retro compilation, and again in 2009 by Avantara for the Pop! Remixed album and EP and by Wayne G & Andy Allder for inclusion on the Phantom Bride EP. Erasure remixed and re-released the track in December 2010 as a digital download-only single for charity. Proceeds from the sale of the single benefit the Hetrick-Martin Institute, the home of the Harvey Milk High School in New York, and the True Colors Fund. Called the \"HMI Redux\", it includes additional vocals from the Hetrick-Martin Institute youth chorus. Numerous HMI youth were featured in the \"HMI Redux\" music video that accompanied the track. Produced by Laundry Service Media and directed by Jason Stein, the video premiered on the Huffington Post and was featured on Perez Hilton."@en ;

The song was composed by Vince Clarke and Andy Bell and is an uptempo dance music track. The music video features Bell singing the song as he walks through an amusement park (the actual filming was done in the London Docklands). Upon its release, the song became Erasure's twenty-second consecutive Top 20 hit in the UK singles chart. In Germany the song stopped at number sixty-nine. It was a hit on the U.S. dance charts, peaking at number ten on the Hot Dance Music/Club Play chart in Billboard magazine.

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Irish_Blood,_English_Heart>	rdf:type	dbo:MusicalWork ;
	dbo:abstract	"\"Irish Blood, English Heart\" is a song written by British singer Morrissey from his 2004 album You Are the Quarry. It was released on 4 May 2004 in the United States and 10 May 2004 internationally. The song had been performed live numerous times prior to release, but Morrissey was without a record deal for some time. It was Morrissey's first single in seven years, and considered a major comeback. The music was written by Alain Whyte and had already been used on a song called \"Not Bitter But Bored\" for a band he was a part of called Johnny Panic and the Bible of Dreams. Morrissey wrote a whole new set of lyrics for this tune as well as changing the melody. He also did this with another Johnny Panic tune, \"Paranoia\", which was rewritten as \"Don't Make Fun of Daddy's Voice\". In the United Kingdom, the song was first played by Steve Lamacq on BBC Radio 1 on March 29, 2004. However, Radio 1 did not playlist the single. Only XFM, which playlisted it, provided much exposure for the single in the UK. Despite the lack of exposure on mainstream stations, \"Irish Blood, English Heart\" debuted at number 3 on the UK charts, making it Morrissey's highest charting single with or without The Smiths. The song draws on Morrissey's joint English and Irish heritage, and explores the themes of contention between the two nations. It is one of Morrissey's more political songs, with him denouncing Oliver Cromwell, the Tory Party and the Labour Party. The single's world premiere occurred on the KROQ-FM Kevin and Bean show on 22 March 2004. The song received consistent airplay throughout April and May on such alternative rock stations as WFNX (Boston), WWCD (Columbus), CIMX (Windsor), KMBY (Monterey / Salinas), XTRA (San Diego), and of course KROQ-FM (Los Angeles), as well as CFNY (Toronto). The single's airplay increased over the next few months and upon its release it spent two weeks at number 4 on Billboard's Hot 100 Singles Sales chart. It also reached number 36 on the Modern Rock Tracks chart, Morrissey's first single to chart there since 1994. An edited version eventually became one of the songs on the EA Sports videogame FIFA Football 2005's soundtrack. The game's version does not include the line \"And spit upon the name Oliver Cromwell/And denounce this royal line that still salutes him. And will salute him, forever\"; instead, after the verse \"I've been dreaming of a time when/The English are sick to death of Labour and Tories\", the song reverts to the line that begins \"To be standing by the flag not feeling shameful/Racist or partial\". The song has also been released as downloadable content for the console versions of the main games in the Rock Band series."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Moon & the Sky is a song by synthpop duo Erasure. Originally intended as the second single[citation needed] from their ninth studio album Loveboat, the album cut was remixed drastically for radio play by Jason Creasey and packaged with enough additional tracks and mixes that it could be considered an EP. Mute Records released the single in the UK under the title Moon & the Sky Plus, a similar tactic used for one of Erasure's previous singles (\"Rain\"). The song was written by Vince Clarke and Andy Bell and is an uptempo, electronic dance track. In its album version the song has a harsher, more techno-influenced feel. Maverick Records, Erasure's U.S. record label at the time, requested the single remixes[citation needed] but ended up passing on the Loveboat album altogether and releasing Erasure from their contract, leaving Mute records to release the U.S. version of Loveboat in 2003. The extended track count and running time of Moon & the Sky Plus made it ineligible for the UK singles chart at the time. A 12 inch single, presented as a double A-side with a remix of Loveboat track Perchance To Dream was also released. Similar to the promo version (P12MUTE248) distributed to nightclub DJs to promote the album, the two-track record was credited to \"V & A\" (referring to the members of Erasure, Vince Clark and Andy Bell, rather than naming them outright). The 12\" was only available from the Mute Records' own shop (Mute Bank) and specialist dance music shops.[citation needed]"@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"Cleanin' Out My Closet\" is a song by American rapper Eminem from his fourth studio album The Eminem Show (2002). \"Cleanin' Out My Closet\" was the second single released off the album following \"Without Me\". However, unlike the preceding single which was as his humorous Slim Shady persona, \"Cleanin' Out My Closet\" was a serious yet sarcastic song based on his childhood and relationships. It also depicts Eminem venting his anger towards his mother, Debbie Mathers, for the way she raised him. In the hook, Eminem sarcastically apologizes to his mother for hurting her and making her cry but takes it back by showing the world what his mother, according to him, was like. It became the second Top 10 single from the album, reaching number four on the United States Billboard Hot 100 chart, and one of the highest-charting singles of his career. The song did not reach number one on any foreign charts, but was certified Platinum in Australia. \"Cleanin' Out My Closet\" was also used in the initial theatrical trailer to Eminem's film 8 Mile, released in November 2002. With the release of The Marshall Mathers LP 2 in 2013, Eminem apologized to his mother on the track \"Headlights\". He stated (among other things such as wrongfully mocking her drug problem, regretting that he never let his daughters meet their grandmother) that he cringes when he hears \"Cleanin' Out My Closet\" on the radio, and that he does not play the song in concert any more."@en ;

It was written by Beyonc\u00E9, Scott Storch and Robert Waller for her debut solo album Dangerously in Love (2003). Beyonc\u00E9 decided that she wanted a deeper and more personal song for the third single; the song was sent by Columbia Records to US radio on October 19, 2003. \"Me, Myself and I\" is an R&B song about dealing with a philandering boyfriend and learning from the consequences. \"Me, Myself and I\" was generally well received by music critics, who complimented the smooth and assertive vocals of Beyonc\u00E9 and called it a 1980s throwback from Dangerously in Love. The Grammy Award-nominated song earned Beyonc\u00E9, Storch and Waller an American Society of Composers, Authors, and Publishers Pop Music Award. \"Me, Myself and I\" peaked at number four on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart, and became Beyonc\u00E9's fourth consecutive US top five single. It was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). The single reached the top 20 in Australia, the UK and in some European countries. Directed by Johan Renck, the accompanying music video follows the plot of the song's theme and the events in the video are played in reverse. \"Me, Myself and I\" was part of Beyonc\u00E9's set list on the Verizon Ladies First Tour, the Dangerously in Love Tour, The Beyonc\u00E9 Experience and the I Am...

According to the Roadrunner Records website: \"The video for Stone Sour's 'Silly World' takes a crack at all the bullshit going on in the world today...apathy, tyranny, poverty, violence, and greed are all targets.\" The lyrics are a critique of how ideas are becoming nothing but symbols through media corruption, and then dying off as they lose their significance. It speaks of instances such as love becoming \"Just a song,\" or peace being \"Just two fingers now... just a phase.\" Similar to \"Through Glass\", the content of the song is angry and has rebellious undertone, despite its softer, slower instrumental style."@en ;

dbr:Hitsville_UK	rdf:type	dbo:MusicalWork ;
	dbo:abstract	"\"Hitsville U.K.\" is a song by The Clash and the second off their fourth album Sandinista!. A duet between lead guitarist Mick Jones and his then-girlfriend Ellen Foley, it's the 13th single release by The Clash. The lyrics refer to the emerging indie scene in British music in the late '70s and early '80s, which is held in contrast to the \"mutants, creeps and musclemen\" of the major labels with their \"expense accounts\" and \"lunch discounts\", making \"AOR\" and using \"chart-hyping\" to sell their records. References are made to a number of UK independent labels (Small Wonder, Rough Trade, Fast Product and Factory). The song's title is a nod to Motown Records, which used the moniker \"Hitsville U.S.A.\" in its advertising and to refer to the label's first headquarters in Detroit. The original UK release had \"Radio One\" by Mikey Dread as the B-side. A second issue released later in 1981 in the U.S. (catalog number 51013) replaced \"Radio One\" with \"Police on My Back\" as the B-side. Like all other Clash singles, the song is also available in the 1991 compilation The Singles. American indie band Joy Zipper covered \"Hitsville U.K.\" for the Uncut magazine cover disc White Riot Volume Two: A Tribute to The Clash in 2003."@en ;

The exceptions to the vocal changes lay in the final iterations of the chorus that finish out the song. Additionally, this new version of the track was cut by approximately 00:37 seconds by removing the transitional \"Kill you, fuck you, I will never be you\" section. Selected profanities were also replaced with less offensive phrases; for example, the phrase \"...the everyday bullshit things that you have done\" was substituted with the alternative, \"...the everyday abusive things that you have done\" and \"You fucking touch me, I will rip you apart...\" was replaced with \"...and if you touch me, I will rip you apart...\".

dbr:Stop_the_Cavalry	rdf:type	dbo:MusicalWork ;
	dbo:abstract	"\"Stop the Cavalry\" is a song written and performed by the English musician Jona Lewie. The song peaked at number three in the UK Singles Chart in December 1980, at one point only being kept from number one by two re-issued songs by John Lennon, who had been murdered on 8 December. In an interview for Channel 4's 100 Greatest Christmas Moments, Lewie said that the song was never intended as a Christmas hit, and that it was a protest song. The line 'Wish I was at home for Christmas' as well as the brass band arrangements made it an appropriately styled song to play around Christmas time. The song's promotional video is set in the trenches of the First World War. The lyrics of the song mention cavalry and Churchill (who served as the First Lord of the Admiralty in the first year of the war, prior to serving in the trenches himself), but it breaks with the First World War theme with references to nuclear fallout and the line \"I have had to fight, almost every night, down throughout these centuries\". Lewie described the song's soldier as being \"a bit like the eternal soldier at the Arc de Triomphe\". At the time there was an increase in tension between the West and the Soviet Union, with American-controlled nuclear cruise missiles being stationed in the UK and a renewed fear of nuclear war. That is the context in which this anti-war song was written, and explains the reference to the fallout shelter. The song's melody is loosely based on a theme from Swedish Rhapsody No. 1 by Hugo Alfv\u00E9n, and its major musical elements bear a resemblance to Mozart's Rondo in D Major, K382. \"Stop the Cavalry\" reached #2 in Australia behind Slim Dusty's \"Duncan\". Jona Lewie's version was issued by Stiff Records (catalogue number Buy 104). In 1981, Stiff Records brought together the Gwalia Singers \u2014 a Welsh male voice choir \u2014 and the Cory Band to record a new arrangement of the song (catalogue number Buy 133). This version remains one of the most requested of all holiday songs in parts of the USA. and it has been suggested that it is \"probably the most popular song ever by an artist who never had a charted recording\""@en ;

However, it is much better known as a single by American singer Cyndi Lauper, whose version was released in 1983. It was the first major single released by Lauper as a solo artist and the lead-off single from her debut album She's So Unusual. Lauper\u2019s version gained recognition as a feminist anthem and was promoted by a Grammy-winning video. It has been covered on either an album or in live concert by over 30 other artists. The single was Lauper's breakthrough hit, reaching No. 2 on the Billboard Hot 100 and becoming a worldwide hit throughout late 1983 and early 1984. It remains one of Lauper's signature songs and was a widely popular song during the era of its release, the 1980s. The \"Rolling Stone & MTV: '100 Greatest Pop Songs': 1-50\", \"Rolling Stone: \"The 100 Top Music Videos\"\" and the \"VH1: 100 Greatest Videos\" lists ranked the song at No. 22, No. 39 and No. 45, respectively.

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/New_Power_Generation_(song)>	rdf:type	dbo:MusicalWork ;
	dbo:abstract	"\"New Power Generation\", or \"N.P.G.\", is a song by American musician Prince from the 1990 album and film, Graffiti Bridge. It is an anthem for his backing band, The New Power Generation, who were officially co-credited on his album covers for a time, and continue to back him up, albeit with a changing lineup. The song saw minimal chart attention, and was not as successful as its predecessor, \"Thieves in the Temple\". \"N.P.G.\" is a funk number featuring drumming by Morris Day, and vocal help by Rosie Gaines. The funk is cut by some carnival-like organ playing and distorted guitar. The song is generally a positive message of overcoming odds. The part two continuation of the song features contributions from a number of artists, as well as samples of several unreleased songs. Tevin Campbell and Mavis Staples sing in part two, and a rap is delivered by T.C. Ellis. Unreleased songs sampled include \"My Tree\", \"Oobee Doop\", and \"Positive Place\". The B-side for the single was \"New Power Generation, pt. 2\", also from Graffiti Bridge. The 12\" and CD maxi release contained numerous previously unheard remixes and bonus material. It began with a \"Funky Weapon Remix\" of \"N.P.G.\", which combined parts one and two of the song, but removed all other vocals other than Prince. Next was \"T.C.'s Rap\". This mix was the \"True Confessions\" rap by rapper T.C. Ellis, whom Prince would later assist on a 1991 album. Another rap follows called \"Brother with a Purpose\". The main song was slowed down, and Tony M. delivers an original rap atop the tune. \"Get Off\" is next, which is a new song over the beat of \"N.P.G.\" Some ideas from this track would later be incorporated in the similarly titled \"Gett Off\" from Diamonds and Pearls. \"Get Off\" is then incorporated into \"The Lubricated Lady\". The final track is a song about a threesome called \"Loveleft, Loveright\", which itself was sampled in \"New Power Generation, pt. 2\". The song ends with the same spoken segment from Prince that begins the EP. The 12\" single released in the UK included \"Melody Cool\" (Extended Remix), sung by Mavis Staples. In Japan, the CD maxi single included all the tracks from the US maxi single, plus those from \"Thieves in the Temple\"."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"Traveling\" is a song recorded by Japanese recording artist and producer Hikaru Utada taken from her third studio album Deep River (2002). The song was written, co-produced and co-composed by Utada herself, while additional production was handled by her father, Japanese producer Teruzane Utada and Akira Miyake. The song was used on her greatest hits compilation Utada Hikaru Single Collection Vol. 1 (2004). The conception for the track was first recorded and written while she was in progress off Deep River, but she put off all work for the single and album after she was diagnosed with an benign ovarian tumor, which caused her to stop all musical activity. Musically, the song is a dance-oriented song that is particularly different from her previous efforts. The song incorporates traditional house music and disco music. The music composition was composed by Utada like her previous singles and contains instrumentation of synthesizers, keyboards, electric guitars and bass guitars, which is similar to the tracks on the parent album. Lyrically, the song talks about traveling through a dream and differentiating the difference between reality and fantasy, incorporating the theme off spirituality throughout the track. \"Traveling\" achieved favorable reception from most contemporary music critics, who praised the production values and vocal delivery. Many critics have also cited the song as one of the album's and her career highlight. The song was a commercial success, peaking at number one on the Daily and Weekly Oricon Chart, becoming her sixth single to do so. The song peaked at number two on the Yearly Chart, only just behind Japanese recording artist Ayumi Hamasaki's EP single H, which was the only release to sell over one million units. The song was certified million by Recording Industry Association of Japan (RIAJ) for shipments off one million units within Japan, despite selling over 850,000 units. An accompanying music video for \"Traveling\" was directed by Utada's ex-husband, Kazuaki Kiriya and features Utada on a train traveling through a computer generated world with passengers with a variety off colored costumes and clothes. The music video was commercially successful, peaking at number one on the DVD chart in Japan. The song was performed during Utada's two date concert series Wild Life in December 2010, and has never been performed on live television."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"Baby, Baby I Need You\" is a 1963 song recorded by The Temptations for the Gordy (Motown) label. It was written by Smokey Robinson, and was later used as the B-side to their Top 40 1964 hit \"Girl (Why You Wanna Make Me Blue)\". The song is about one's devotion to the one they love; it's narrator telling the girl he's falling for that if she let their \u201Chearts combine\u201D that he vows to always let her know how much he needs, wants, and loves her. A fusion of Gospel and Doo-Wop, the song is mostly an ensemble piece, with all the original members singing most of the song's lead vocal in unison (with Eddie Kendricks' higher falsetto voice making him the primary vocal in song). It is on the song\u2019s bridge and outro where Kendricks and Paul Williams each sing a few lead lines out front while Elbridge \"Al\" Bryant sings harmony vocals behind Kendricks and Williams (and throughout the song's bridge). All the group members get a chance to also be heard outfront when they sing the last word of each of the song's three verses in a five-part harmony (Bryant, Williams, Kendricks, Otis Williams, and Melvin Franklin respectively). This B-side is the last single released to feature Bryant's vocals (he was fired several months prior), and the last to feature Paul Williams' signing lead that would be released while he was still the group's main lead singer (although he would still record a few more leads). With the release of the single \"My Girl\", newest member David Ruffin would become The Tempts' new main lead (more or less replacing both Williams and Kendricks in the role). Although \"Baby, Baby I Need You\" did not chart nationally, the song was a regional smash hit in some parts of the country. It was a favorite of fans of the group (and the group itself) and became a part of the Temptations' onstage repertoire. The song was performed by the \"classic five\" members on the group's first live album, Temptations Live! where it received a standing ovation. In 1966, The Wailers, featuring Bob Marley, covered the song (retitled \"I Need You\") which was released as a single and included on the 1966 compilation album, The Wailing Wailers. The Wailers also recorded a different song of the title \"I Need You\" in 1964, and so recent releases have retitled this cover as \"I Need You So\"."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"Get Ur Freak On\" is a song by American recording artist Missy \"Misdemeanor\" Elliott. It was written and produced by Elliott and Timbaland for her third studio album Miss E... So Addictive (2001). Based on heavy bhangra elements, a popular music and dance form from the Punjab state of India, the song features a six-note base that is a Punjabi melody played on a tumbi, a stringed Indian instrument. Released as the album's first single in 2001, the track reached number seven on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart. Internationally, \"Get Ur Freak On\" became a top ten success in the Netherlands and the United Kingdom, where it became her first solo top ten hit, peaking at number four. A remix of the song featuring Nelly Furtado was a dance club hit during this period, and was used both in the soundtrack and in the background of the movie Lara Croft: Tomb Raider (2001) starring Angelina Jolie. The song is also heard in The Rundown (2003) starring Dwayne Johnson (remixed with AC/DC's \"Back in Black\") and The 40-Year-Old Virgin (2005) starring Steve Carell. In December, the song was listed 14th on Rolling Stone's Best Songs of the Decade ranking, and later at number 466 on their The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time updated list of 2010. In 2002, \"Get Ur Freak On\" was named the best single released in the year 2001 by The Village Voice's Pazz & Jop annual year-end critics' poll. The song also lists at number seven on Pitchfork Media's Top 500 Songs of the 2000s and number 16 on VH1's Greatest Songs of Hip-Hop. In 2011, NME placed it at number 17 on its list \"150 Best Tracks of the Past 15 Years\". In April 2014, the song was remixed with The Black Keys' song \"Keep Me\" for the original soundtrack to Neighbors (2014). On the Billboard magazine issue dated February 21, 2015, \"Get Ur Freak On\" re-entered at #40, more than a decade after its original chart run. This re-entry was spawned by Missy Elliott's performance at the Super Bowl XLIX halftime show that occurred earlier in the month."@en ;

The track is an uptempo dance music song written by Vince Clarke and Andy Bell. Mute Records issued the single in the UK. For the song's release in the United States, Maverick Records requested a remix for radio. The U.S. single version of \"Don't Say Your Love Is Killing Me\" is quite different from what is on the Cowboy album. The song's intro was changed, as well as the middle eight section. Most notably, an entire verse, edited out of the album version, is restored on the American single release. The single's B-side is a live cover version of Blondie's \"Heart of Glass\". Erasure's previous single \"In My Arms\" featured another Blondie cover (\"Rapture\"). On the UK singles chart, \"Don't Say Your Love Is Killing Me\" peaked at #23, ending a chart run of 24 consecutive Top 20 singles. It reached #89 on the German singles chart and did not enter the Billboard Hot 100.

It was released by Saban Records (now Saban Music Group) on CD and cassette formats in the US on December 2, 1994, and in the UK December 14, 1994. The song serves as the opening theme for the first three seasons of the original Power Rangers series Mighty Morphin Power Rangers. The song, with a slight altered lyrics, was also used for the mini-series Alien Rangers. The titular refrain \"Go Go Power Rangers\" has become a popular catchphrase associated with the show, and has been used in several other themes for the series. The song was composed and produced within a few hours after Wasserman viewed early footage of the original series. A cover of the song, performed by Noam Kaniel, has been used as the show's intro theme since 2011, starting with the 18th season of the franchise, Power Rangers Samurai. A rearrangement of Kaniel's version was used for 2013's Power Rangers Megaforce, changing some lyrics to reflect that season. Another rearrangement is currently being used for Power Rangers Dino Charge."@en .

Although the band did release the song as a single and filmed a video for it (featuring the band members performing the song on a boat, with a cameo appearance by Kirk Hammett of Metallica, who has been a close friend of Claypool since they attended the same school), the single had very limited success due to its being released on an indie label, and the band did not receive mainstream attention until their next single, \"Jerry Was a Race Car Driver\", from their 1991 major label debut Sailing the Seas of Cheese. Because of this, many overlook \"John the Fisherman\" and claim \"Jerry Was a Race Car Driver\" was Primus' first single. When Frizzle Fry was re-released in 2002, many fans who caught on during the major label days of the band bought the album, and it became a fan favorite. There was a new interest in this song, and it received some radio and MTV airplay. \"John The Fisherman\" is the first part of a four-part story called the \"Fisherman's Chronicles\", which continued on Primus' later albums.

The single was released as a CD on 28 November. The physical single contained a copy of Leith's original song \"Come to Me\", which can be streamed from his Myspace. The single was written by Adam Reily and is the first of the winner\u2019s singles to be penned by a local songwriter. A music video was shot for the song on 28 November. In less than 72 hours of \"Night of My Life\" being on sale, the single was certified Gold status. The single debuted at number one on the ARIA Singles Chart on 3 December, while certified Platinum after one week of sales. It was the fastest selling debut single for 2006, and was the most added song to radio. This single was the first Australian act to reach the #1 spot since Youth Group's, \"Forever Young\" in April 2006. It remained at number one for five consecutive weeks. Despite being released at the end of 2006, the single's strong sales placed \"Night of My Life\" at number eleven in the 2006 End of Year Top 100 ARIA Singles Chart. In mid-December, Jessica Mauboy's version of the song was released online by a New Zealand website which released it for legal download, even though she did not win Australian Idol.

	dbo:abstract	"\"The Man Don't Give a Fuck\" is a song by Super Furry Animals, twice released as a single by the group. It is based round a sample from the Steely Dan song \"Show Biz Kids\" - \"You know they don't give a fuck about anybody else\". The sample is repeated more than 50 times and so the single is claimed to feature the word \"fuck\" more than any other song, but Insane Clown Posse's \"Fuck the World\" in fact beats it with 93 instances. However, the live re-issue of \"The Man Don't Give A Fuck\" broke that record. The song was originally intended as a B-side for previous single \"If You Don't Want Me to Destroy You\" but the group had not been able to clear the sample in time. However, they persevered and when they were able to clear the sample, released the song as a single in its own right. This arguably sealed the song's cult status among SFA fans, and it became the group's standard set-closer when playing live: the outro would often extend to ten or twenty minutes, with keyboard player Cian Ciaran in particular taking the opportunity to improvise wildly around the basic sample. A live version was released in 2004. In October 2011, NME placed it at number 66 on its list \"150 Best Tracks of the Past 15 Years\"."@en ;

The song was Woodgate's first credit as a songwriter, and was released as the band's 7th single on 16 January 1981. The single reached number 7 in the UK, and remained in the charts for 7 weeks. The single release was slightly different from the track on the album Absolutely, and was roughly 30 seconds longer. The song is mainly instrumental, except for some ad-libbing by Chas Smash at the beginning, the sound of \"Waiter!\" approximately 42 seconds into the track, and \"Good night!\" at the very end. Dave Robinson, head of Stiff Records, was keen on Madness recording another instrumental track, especially after the success of \"One Step Beyond...\". The resulting song was not as ska influenced as their earlier songs, and was played heavily on BBC Radio 2. This helped Madness gain a new generation of older fans."@en ;

The instrumental (\"Toca Me\") was written by Dirk Duderstadt, Marco Duderstadt, Ramon Zenker and the lyrics (of \"I Need a Miracle\") were written by Rob Davis and Victor Imbres, while some of the song's production was produced by Ramon Zenker, the vocals were produced many years earlier by Imbres and Tim Orford. The song was critically acclaimed worldwide, with many critics citing the song one of the best dance anthems of all time, praising its catchy tune. The song was also a commercial success, remaining both Star's and Fragma's best selling single to date. The song topped the UK Singles Chart in April 2000 and peaked inside the top ten in countries including Ireland, Denmark, Norway, Italy and Australia. A music video was issued, depicting Coco Star at an indoor football game. The song was re-issued in 2008 by Tiger Records with new remixes. The song also received mixed reviews from music critics, but managed to gain commercial success around the globe. Additionally, a new music video was issued for the single, but did not feature Star in the video. The song was then once again re-released in 2012 by Tiger Records.

	dbo:abstract	"\"(Come 'Round Here) I'm the One You Need\" is a 1966 hit single by Motown group The Miracles, released on Motown Records' Tamla label. Unlike most Miracles songs, which were written and produced by the group themselves, \"I'm the One You Need\" was written and produced by Motown's main songwriting and production team Holland\u2013Dozier\u2013Holland, best known for their work with The Supremes and The Four Tops. Holland-Dozier-Holland had written and produced two previous Miracles singles: the Top 10 hit \"Mickey's Monkey\" and the Top 40 hit \"I Gotta Dance to Keep From Crying\" (both 1963). \"I'm the One You Need\" was the final Miracles single released before lead singer Smokey Robinson was given star billing on the group's 45's. In this popular Miracles tune, Smokey Robinson, as the song's narrator, seeks to comfort a girl he obviously loves, who belongs to another man who cheats on her, and treats her badly: With the solution,to the broken-hearted girl's problem, Smokey continues... While Smokey sings lead, The other Miracles, Bobby, Ron, Pete, and Claudette, back him with repeated chants of \"Come 'Round Here,Honey Honey...I'm the one you need,Honey Honey\"... Two versions of this song were released, with very notable changes. The first version was released on the single; this version also appears on mono copies of the Miracles' 1966 album Away We a Go-Go. The second version used a different take, was in stereo, and had Smokey's lead more prominent than the single version; this version was released on the stereo LP editions of the album. The single was a Top 20 Pop Hit,peaking at number 17 on the Billboard Hot 100, and a Top 10 R&B hit, peaking at number four on Billboard's R&B singles chart. It was also a Top 20 hit in the UK, but not until February 1971, when it peaked at number 13. \"(Come 'Round Here) I'm the One You Need\" was the most successful single featured on their album Away We a Go-Go, and has been covered by acts such as The Jackson 5, The Cowsills, and The GP's . In 1967 The Miracles themselves recorded an Italian language version, entitled Non sono quello che tu vuoi (I'm not that man you want). The song's \"B\" side, \"Save Me\" was covered in a 1966 ska version as \"Rude Boy Prayer\" by a group consisting of Alton Ellis, Zoot Sims, Bob Marley and an unknown female vocalist. Despite being highly regarded, this version remains officially unavailable outside its original blank labelled 7\" vinyl release. The Undertones also covered the song."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"Bitter Sweet Symphony\" is a song by English alternative rock band The Verve, and is the lead track on their third studio album, Urban Hymns (1997). It is based on an Andrew Loog Oldham orchestral version of The Rolling Stones' song \"The Last Time\", from which it samples a main theme, and involved some legal controversy surrounding a plagiarism charge as a result. Consequently, Mick Jagger and Keith Richards were added to the songwriting credits. \"Bitter Sweet Symphony\" was released on 16 June 1997 by Hut Recordings as the first single from the album, reaching number two on the UK Singles Chart and stayed in the chart for three months. The song's momentum built slowly in the U.S. throughout the latter months of 1997, ultimately leading to a CD single release on 3 March 1998 by Virgin Records America, helping the song to reach number 12 on the Billboard Hot 100. The song's music video, which received heavy rotation on MTV, focuses on Richard Ashcroft lip-synching the song while walking down a busy London pavement, oblivious to what is going on around and refusing to change his stride or direction throughout. At the 1998 Brit Awards, \"Bitter Sweet Symphony\" was nominated for Best British Single, and at the 1998 MTV Video Music Awards, the song was nominated for Video of the Year, Best Group Video, and Best Alternative Video.

The melody is based on an Armenian folk song. It was not performed until the 1950, off-Broadway production of The Son. The song did not become a hit until the release of Clooney's recording. It was probably Saroyan's only effort at popular songwriting, and it was one of Bagdasarian's few well-known works that was not connected to his best-known creation, Alvin and the Chipmunks.

Eriksen, Espen Lind, Amund Bj\u00F8rklund, Beyonc\u00E9 and produced by Stargate and Beyonc\u00E9. \"Irreplaceable\" was originally a country record; it was re-arranged as a mid-tempo ballad with pop and R&B influences by modifying the vocal arrangements and instrumentation. During the production and recording sessions, Beyonc\u00E9 and Ne-Yo wanted to create a record which people of either gender could relate to. The song's lyrics are about the breakdown of a relationship with an unfaithful man and the song contains a message about female empowerment. Following the moderate chart performances of \"D\u00E9j\u00E0 Vu\" and \"Ring the Alarm\", \"Irreplaceable\" was released internationally on October 23, 2006 as the album's second single, and the third in the United States on December 5, 2006. The single was released through Columbia Records. \"Irreplaceable\" was well received by contemporary music critics, who cited its distinct production compared with most songs featured on the album, and complimented its hook, \"To the left, to the left\". Pitchfork Media and Rolling Stone placed it on their lists of Best Songs of the 2000s. \"Irreplaceable\" won several awards, including Best R&B/Soul Single at the 2007 Soul Train Music Awards. It was nominated for the Record of the Year award at the 50th Grammy Awards. The single was commercially successful worldwide. It became Beyonc\u00E9's fourth number-one in the U.S., was B'Day's most successful release, and remained at the top of the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 chart for ten consecutive weeks. \"Irreplaceable\" was the best-selling U.S. single of 2007, the twenty-fifth most successful song of the 2000s (decade) in the U.S., and was certified double-platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). It became Beyonc\u00E9's second single to achieve 200 million audience impressions in 2006. She is the second singer to achieve this feat in the U.S., the first having been Mariah Carey in 2005. \"Irreplaceable\" peaked at number one in Australia, at number four in the United Kingdom, and reached the top twenty in several European countries. \"Irreplaceable\" was 2007's tenth best-selling digital single with over 4.6 million copies sold worldwide. The single's accompanying music video was directed by Anthony Mandler and served as the debut performance of Beyonc\u00E9's all-female band, Suga Mama. The video was included on the 2007 B'Day Anthology Video Album, and a video edit was produced for \"Irreemplazable\", the Spanish version of the song. It won the Video of the Year award at the 2007 Black Entertainment Television (BET) Awards, and was nominated for the MTV Video Music Award for Video of the Year at the 2007 Awards. \"Irreplaceable\" has regularly featured in Beyonc\u00E9's tours and live performances since 2006.

	dbo:abstract	"\"Then You Look at Me\" is a theme song from the movie Bicentennial Man. It was supposed to be released as the second single from Celine Dion's album All the Way... A Decade of Song, on December 11, 1999. \"Then You Look at Me\" was written by James Horner and Will Jennings, who wrote for Dion her 1997 hit \"My Heart Will Go On\". The Bicentennial Man film, released on December 13, 1999, and starring Robin Williams, became a flop and the single was cancelled. The second reason was that \"That's the Way It Is\" became a hit and was still strong on the singles charts around the world. However, \"Then You Look at Me\" was included as a B-side to the \"Live (for the One I Love)\", The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face\" and \"I Want You to Need Me\" singles. The movie soundtrack also included the song but in a slightly modified version, produced by James Horner and Simon Franglen. The version from Dion's album was produced by David Foster, Horner and Franglen and differs in arrangements and in Dion's interpretation. The \"Then You Look at Me\" music video, featuring Dion in a futuristic outfit and set in a robot research facility with clips of the film playing on screens in the background, was directed by Bille Woodruff and released at the end of 1999.

The single sold 148,000 copies in 2006 in the UK. The track was leaked onto the Internet on September 20, 2006, and released as a single on November 13, 2006, charting in many countries.

dbr:Check_on_It	rdf:type	dbo:MusicalWork ;
	dbo:abstract	"\"Check on It\" is a song recorded by American singer Beyonc\u00E9, featuring American rappers Bun B and Slim Thug. It was composed by Beyonc\u00E9, Swizz Beatz, Sean Garrett, Angela Beyinc\u00E9 and Slim Thug. Initially recorded by Beyonc\u00E9 only, the song was supposed to be featured on the soundtrack album for 2006 film The Pink Panther, in which she co-stars. As it was ultimately not included on its soundtrack album, the song with additional vocals from Slim Thug was placed on the 2005 Destiny's Child's greatest hits album #1's. Columbia Records released \"Check on It\" in the United States on December 13, 2005. The official single version of the song includes vocals from American rapper Bun B. The song's development was motivated by the phrase 'Check on It' which Beyonc\u00E9 and her management jokingly used before they decided to turn it into a song. \"Check on It\" is an R&B and hip hop song, which is instrumentally complete with a heavy bassline, strings, and wind instrument. Lyrically, it takes place in a club, where Beyonc\u00E9 is letting the male patrons know that they are welcome to come and look at her sexually attractive body when she is dancing. The song consists of two verse-raps by Slim Thug. \"Check on It\" was well received by contemporary music critics, who universally complimented Beyonc\u00E9's vocals, and the assertiveness with which she sings her lines. \"Check on It\" was not originally lined up for a release as a single from the album #1's. However, it received heavy rotation on US radio stations, following the release of the first single, \"Stand Up for Love\" (2005), which performed poorly on the charts. Eventually, \"Check on It\" debuted on the US Billboard Hot 100 in November 2005, before its official release date. The single peaked at number one for five consecutive weeks, becoming one of the two longest-running number-one single in 2006, and Beyonc\u00E9's third US number-one single as a solo artist. \"Check on It\" reached number one in New Zealand and the top ten on various singles chart in mainland Europe. The music video for the song was directed by Hype Williams, and premiered on December 16, 2005 on MTV. The version of \"Check on It\" used in the clip features a remix of \"The Pink Panther Theme\" and a verse-rap from American rapper Bun B. Incorporating 1950s influences, the video was shot in pink to brand the relationship with The Pink Panther. It won the Best R&B Video at the 2006 MTV Video Music Awards, and was nominated for Video of the Year at the 2006 BET Awards. Although Beyonc\u00E9 did not perform \"Check on It\" in any televised appearances, it was a part of her set list on The Beyonc\u00E9 Experience (2007) and the I Am... Tour (2009\u201310)."@en ;

It is the fifth track on their 2004 album How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb and was released as the album's fourth single on 6 June 2005. The song was a top ten hit in Ireland, the United Kingdom, and several other countries. The music video was shot in Vancouver, British Columbia. The earliest incarnation of the song was developed during sessions for the band's 1997 album Pop. The lyrics were partially inspired by lead singer Bono's recollection of his first trip to London, and by the band's experience of playing New York City in the aftermath of the September 11 attacks. Other lyrics refer to Bono's relationship with his wife. The song's underlying theme reflects lost innocence and was inspired by an image Bono saw of himself from the early 1980s. The sound has been compared to the tone of U2's 1984 album The Unforgettable Fire and their 1987 single \"Where the Streets Have No Name.\" \"City of Blinding Lights\" was well received by critics and won a Grammy Award for Best Rock Song at the 2006 ceremony. The song made its live debut on the group's 2005 Vertigo Tour, when it was commonly played as the opening song, and it has been performed at every show from a U2 concert tour since. The track has been used in episodes of The Simpsons and Entourage, and in the film The Devil Wears Prada. President Barack Obama used it at campaign events during the 2008 and 2012 U.S. presidential elections, and listed it as one of his favourite songs; U2 performed it at his inaugural celebration."@en ;

It was written in collaboration with Harold Lilly and Jermaine Dupri, and produced by the latter along with frequent co-producer Bryan Michael Cox for her original third studio album, All Eyez on Me (2002). When the album was shelved for release outside Japan, the song was one out of five original records that were transferred into its new version, After the Storm (2003). A contemporary R&B slow jam, \"U Should've Known Better\" contains elements of soul music and rock music. Built on an pulsating backbeat, the song's instrumentation consists of screeching guitars and an understated harp pattern. Lyrically, Monica, as the protagonist, delivers a message of loyalty to her imprisoned love interest and sings about staying down for him despite his doubts. The song was generally well received by contemporary music critics who highlighted the heartfelt emotion and sadness. Released as the fourth and final single from After the Storm in May 2004, the single marked Monica's first balladic release in over five years. On the charts, \"U Should've Known Better\" peaked at number 19 on the US Billboard Hot 100 and number 6 on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Singles & Tracks, becoming the album's highest-charting single release after \"So Gone\".

	dbo:abstract	"\"Free as a Bird\" is a song originally composed and recorded in 1977 as a home demo by John Lennon. In 1995 a studio version of the recording, incorporating contributions from Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr, was released as a single by The Beatles. It was released 25 years after the break-up of the band and 15 years after the death of Lennon. The single was released as part of the promotion for The Beatles Anthology video documentary and the band's Anthology 1 compilation album. For the Anthology project, McCartney asked Lennon's widow Yoko Ono for unreleased material by Lennon to which the three remaining ex-Beatles could contribute. \"Free as a Bird\" was one of two such songs (along with \"Real Love\") for which McCartney, Harrison, and Starr contributed additional instrumentation, vocals, and arrangements. Jeff Lynne of Electric Light Orchestra, who had worked with Harrison on Harrison's album Cloud Nine and as part of the Traveling Wilburys, was asked to co-produce the record. The music video for \"Free as a Bird\" was produced by Vincent Joliet and directed by Joe Pytka; from the point of view of a bird in flight, it depicts many references to Beatles songs, such as \"Strawberry Fields Forever,\" \"Penny Lane\", \"Paperback Writer\", \"A Day in the Life\", \"Eleanor Rigby\", \"Revolution\", and \"Helter Skelter\". \"Free as a Bird\" won the 1997 Grammy Award for Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal and was The Beatles' 34th Top 10 single in the United States. The song secured the group at least one Top 40 hit in four different decades (1960s, 1970s, 1980s and 1990s)."@en ;

The song faced comparisons for having similarities with Kelly Clarkson's 2004 single \"Since U Been Gone\". The song was commercially successful worldwide, where it peaked in the top spot in countries including Australia, Czech Republic, Germany, Hungary and component charts in the United States. In addition, the song is also Pink's longest chart runner on the Hot 100, spending 36 weeks before dropping out.

	dbo:abstract	"\"All I Want for Christmas Is You\" is a song performed by American singer and songwriter Mariah Carey, and written and produced by Carey and Walter Afanasieff. It was released by Columbia Records on November 1, 1994 as the lead single from her first holiday album and fourth studio album, Merry Christmas. \"Christmas\" is an uptempo love song that includes bell chimes and heavy back-up vocals, as well as use of synthesizers. The song's lyrics declare that the narrator does not care about Christmas presents or lights; all she wants for Christmas is to be with her lover. Two music videos were commissioned for the song: the song's primary music video features grainy home-movie-style footage of Carey, her dogs and family during the holiday season, as well as Carey dressed in a Santa suit frolicking on a snowy mountainside. Carey's then-husband Tommy Mottola makes a cameo appearance as Santa Claus, bringing Carey a gift and leaving on a red sleigh. The second video was filmed in black and white format, and features Carey dressed in 1960s style in homage to The Ronettes, alongside back up singers and female dancers. Carey has performed \"All I Want for Christmas Is You\" in a slew of live television appearances and tours throughout her career. In 2010, Carey re-recorded the song for her second holiday album, Merry Christmas II You, titled \"All I Want for Christmas Is You (Extra Festive)\". Carey also re-recorded the song as a duet with Canadian singer Justin Bieber for his 2011 album Under the Mistletoe, titled \"All I Want for Christmas for You (SuperFestive!)\". The song has also been covered by many artists over the years. In the years since its original release, \"All I Want for Christmas Is You\" has been critically lauded and has become established as a Christmas standard; it was once called \"one of the few worthy modern additions to the holiday canon\" in The New Yorker, and continues to surge in popularity each holiday season. The song was commercially successful, reaching the number-two position on the singles charts of Australia, Japan, the Netherlands, Norway, and the United Kingdom, and the top 10 in several other countries. The Daily Telegraph hailed \"All I Want for Christmas Is You\" as the most popular and most played Christmas song of the decade in the United Kingdom. Rolling Stone ranked it fourth on its Greatest Rock and Roll Christmas Songs list, calling it a \"holiday standard.\" In December 2015, the song peaked at 11 on the Billboard Hot 100, making it its highest peak since its original release. With global sales of over 14 million copies, the song remains Carey's biggest international success and the 11th best-selling single of all time. As of 2013, the song was reported to have earned $50 million in royalties."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"I'm Not in Love\" is a song by English group 10cc, written by band members Eric Stewart and Graham Gouldman. It is notable for its innovative and distinctive backing track, composed mostly of the band's multitracked vocals. Released in the UK in May 1975 as the second single from the band's third album The Original Soundtrack, it became the second of the group's three number one singles in the UK between 1973 and 1978, topping the UK singles chart for two weeks. The song was also the band's breakthrough hit worldwide, reaching number 1 in Ireland and Canada and number 2 on the Billboard Hot 100 in the US, as well as reaching the top ten in Australia, New Zealand and several European countries. Written mostly by Stewart as a riposte to his wife's declaration that Stewart did not tell her he loved her often enough, \"I'm Not in Love\" was originally conceived as a bossa nova song played on guitars, but the other two members of the band, Kevin Godley and Lol Creme, disliked the track and it was abandoned. However, after hearing members of staff continue to sing the melody around their studio, Stewart persuaded the group that they should give the song another chance, to which Godley replied that for the song to work it needed to be radically changed, and suggested that the band should try and create a new version using just voices. \"I'm Not in Love\" has enjoyed lasting popularity, with over 3 million plays on US radio since its release, and it won three Ivor Novello Awards in 1976 for Best Pop Song, International Hit of the Year, and Most Performed British Work. It has featured in the films The Virgin Suicides, Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason and Guardians of the Galaxy, as well as the video game Grand Theft Auto: Vice City Stories."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"Lay Down\" is a song by English band Strawbs featured on their 1973 album Bursting at the Seams. Their first hit single, it had peaked at No. 12 in the UK Singles Chart late the previous year. The lyrics are loosely based on the 23rd Psalm in the Old Testament and the song was widely considered to be writer Dave Cousins's most commercial and radio-friendly offering to date. Indeed, some aficionados accused Cousins and the band of \"selling out\", especially as the band later appeared on Top of the Pops dressed in glittery \"glam rock\" outfits and wearing make-up (with drummer Richard Hudson unusually placed at the front of the stage). The single was described, in the original A&M Records Press Release, as \".. the Strawbs first real attempt to crack open the singles market.\" It featured strong rock guitar riffs from the band's new guitarist Dave Lambert. The album version features an additional guitar solo, making it about thirty seconds longer than the single. The song was brought to the public's attention again in 2007 when it featured on the BBC television series \"Life on Mars\". It was, however, unaccountably absent from the DVD boxset soundtrack."@en ;

Released December 16, 1986, as a maxi single (Atlantic DM 86744), and then in remixed form (Vocal/3:50, as described herein) February 1987, the song was written by Gibson herself in 1984, two years before she recorded it. Produced by Fred Zarr and engineered by Don Feinberg for BiZarr Music, Inc., mixed by \"Little\" Louie Vega and mastered by Herb \"Pump\" Powers, the dance-pop song reached number four on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 singles chart in the summer of 1987. Douglas Breitbart for Broadbeard Productions, Inc. served as executive producer (see also Debbie Gibson). While it did not initially make the UK top fifty, \"Dreams\" re-entered the UK singles chart in 1988 on the back of the success of her second single (viz., \"Shake Your Love,\" Atlantic UK A9187), eventually peaking at #11. The Extended Club Mix/Vocal track (6:34) from DM 86744 was excerpted for a dance medley, \"Medley: Out of the Blue - Shake Your Love - Only in My Dreams\" (Debbie Gibson Mega Mix), that became Track 4 on Atlantic DM 86556 \"Foolish Beat.\" A different mix, \"Only in My Dreams\" (LP Version/3:54), mastered from the original multitrack for DM 86744, became Track 3 on Gibson's debut album Out Of The Blue (Atlantic LP 81780), and a further variation, \"Only in My Dreams (Dream House Mix/10:03),\" was Track 3 on Atlantic DM 86556 \"Foolish Beat.\" Since the song's release, Gibson has re-recorded the song twice: in 1997 for her album Deborah and in 2010 for the Deluxe Edition release of the Japan-exclusive Ms. Vocalist.

A remixed version of the song (although it bears no resemblance to the original) was released as the fourth and final single from The Massacre, although it is only included on the re-released version and replaces the original version. The remix is also produced by Dr. Dre and Elizondo and features a guest appearance from hip-hop group Mobb Deep.

Both versions of the song have \"heavy\" drum-based productions and also incorporate elements of strings throughout, although the remix is produced more sparsely than the original and also prominently features piano keys throughout. Lyrically, the songs are both largely about 50 Cent's ability to control the attitudes of people during his performances in clubs, describing how he has them \"going outta control\". Due to confusion over which version of the song would be released as a single, both versions of the song charted on the Billboard Hot 100. Though the original peaked at #92 (digital sales alone), the remix was a significant success, peaking at #6 on the Billboard Hot 100 and charting in the upper regions of several national charts worldwide."@en ;

It is a duet between rapper Twista and Carey, featured on his album The Day After and Carey's The Emancipation of Mimi (Ultra Platinum Edition). It was unofficially released in 2006 as the third single from The Day After. The version on The Emancipation of Mimi serves as a sequel track to \"One and Only\" (also featuring Twista), another track from The Emancipation of Mimi, and is subtitled \"One and Only Part 2\". The version on The Day After serves as a sequel track to that and is therefore subtitled \"One and Only Part 3\". The single unofficially impacted U.S. radio on January 18, 2006, but it had already been added to many radio station playlists and internet websites well before this date (in late September 2005). The single was introduced to iTunes as a digital download in late 2005. \"So Lonely\" reached number 14 on Billboard's Bubbling Under Hot 100 Singles chart, which represents the twenty-five singles below the Billboard Hot 100's number 100 position that have not yet appeared on the Hot 100.

dbr:Sound_and_Vision	rdf:type	dbo:MusicalWork ;
	dbo:abstract	"\"Sound and Vision\" is a song and single by David Bowie which appeared on the album Low in 1977.The song is notable for juxtaposing an uplifting guitar and synthesizer-led instrumental track with Bowie\u2019s withdrawn lyrics.In keeping with the minimalist approach of Low, co-producer Visconti and Bowie originally recorded the track as an instrumental, bar the backing vocal (performed by Visconti\u2019s wife, Mary Hopkin). Bowie then recorded his vocal after the rest of the band had left the studio, before trimming verses off the lyric, and leaving a relatively lengthy instrumental intro on the finished song. Selected as a first single from the album, \"Sound and Vision\" was used by the BBC on trailers at the time. This provided considerable exposure, much needed as Bowie opted to do nothing to promote the single himself, and helped the song to No. 3. The song was also a top ten hit in Germany, Austria and the Netherlands. However, it stalled at No. 87 in Canada and only managed No. 69 in the United States where it signalled the end of Bowie's short commercial honeymoon until \"Let's Dance\" in 1983. The first live performance of the song was at Earl\u2019s Court on 1 July 1978. In 1990, it was a regular number for Bowie\u2019s greatest hits Sound + Vision Tour. The name had also been used for Rykodisc boxed set anthology in 1989."@en ;

It was released as the lead single from the album on August 15, 1999.

The song blends the musical styles of several genres, including R&B and Latin music; the instruments used include violin, piano, timbales and congas. Anthony recorded a Spanish-language version of the song, translated by Angie Chirino and Robert Blades, titled \"D\u00EDmelo\". Upon its release, \"I Need to Know\" received mostly positive reviews from music critics and was praised for its production and choice of musical styles. It was nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Male Pop Vocal Performance in 2000. The Spanish-language version of the song won the Latin Grammy Award for Song of the Year in the same year. Both versions of the song won an American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers award in the pop category. Commercially, the song charted in the top five in Canada and the United States. It was certified gold in Australia and the U.S. \"D\u00EDmelo\" peaked at number one on the Billboard Hot Latin Songs chart in the U.S. The music video for the song, directed by Paula Walker, was filmed in Los Angeles. In 2007, American Idol runner-up contestant Blake Lewis performed a cover of \"I Need to Know\" as part of the Latin round during the show's sixth season. His performance was praised by the judges; Simon Cowell called it the best presentation of the night. However, Lewis's performance received a mixed response from critics; some praised the choice of song while some criticized Lewis's vocal delivery.

Originally composed by Patrick Leonard for the score of the film Fire with Fire, the song was shown to Madonna, who decided to use it for then-husband Sean Penn's film At Close Range. Madonna wrote the song's lyrics and co-produced it with Leonard. The song was released as the lead single from True Blue on March 26, 1986 by Sire Records. It later appeared on compilation albums The Immaculate Collection (1990), Something to Remember (1995), and Celebration (2009). A pop ballad, the song includes instrumentation from guitars, keyboards, drums and a synthesizer, and its lyrics deal with deceit, mistrust and childhood scars. It is also about being strong, which Madonna recalled in an interview that she thought about her relationship with her parents, while writing the lyrics. The music video, directed by James Foley, shows Madonna's first image makeover, featuring her with a cleaner look, shoulder-length wavy golden blond hair, conservative wardrobe and subtle make-up. This toned down blond appearance was again inspired by Marilyn Monroe. \"Live to Tell\" was generally well received by music critics, who frequently referred to it as the best ballad of her career. It was also a commercial success, becoming Madonna's third number-one single on the Billboard Hot 100 and her first number-one on the Adult Contemporary chart. The song faced controversy when Madonna performed it on her 2006 Confessions Tour wearing a crown of thorns while hanging on a giant mirrored cross. The performance at Rome's Olympic Stadium was condemned as an act of hostility toward the Roman Catholic Church by religious leaders."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"Love Don't Live Here Anymore\" is a song written by Miles Gregory and originally recorded by Rose Royce. It was produced by former Motown songwriter and producer Norman Whitfield for the Whitfield Records. Lead vocals were sung by Gwen Dickey and the song was released as the second single from their third studio album Rose Royce III: Strikes Again! The song was developed as a result of producer Whitfield's interest to work with Paul Buckmaster, the British arranger and composer. Together they asked songwriter Miles Gregory to write a song for them. Gregory was undergoing medications for his drug overuse problem, and this situation and his deteriorating physical health became the inspiration behind the song. \"Love Don't Live Here Anymore\" incorporated the use of the Electronic LinnDrum machine, and was one of the first songs to effectively use the sound reverbs of the instrument. The song was mainly recorded at music contractor Gene Bianco's house, where Dickey was present during the recording. After its release, the song was critically appreciated, but was only moderately successful commercially. It reached a peak of 32 on the Billboard Hot 100 and five on the Hot Black Singles chart. Its highest position was in the United Kingdom, where it reached two. \"Love Don't Live Here Anymore\" has been covered by a number of artists, including Madonna, Morrissey\u2013Mullen, Faith Evans, and Mary J. Blige. Madonna's version was included in her second studio album Like a Virgin (1984), and it was the idea of Michael Ostin, the head of the A&R department of Warner Bros. Records, that Madonna record a cover version of the song to include in the album. It was further included in her 1995 ballad compilation album Something to Remember, in a remixed form. The original and the remixed version of the Madonna song differs in the usage of more classical instruments in the latter. The 1995 version also received a number of club remix treatments.

It was released as the lead single from their fourth studio album, Elephant, on March 7, 2003, and reached number one on the Modern Rock Tracks\u2014maintaining that position for three weeks. It also became the third best-performing song of the decade on the same chart. It was well received commercially as well, and won the Grammy Award for Best Rock Song. The song is known for its underlying riff, which plays throughout most of the song. Although it sounds like a bass guitar (an instrument the group had never previously used), the sound is actually created by running Jack White's semi-acoustic, 1950s-style Kay Hollowbody guitar through a DigiTech Whammy pedal set down an octave. A combination of the song's popularity, recognizable riff, and defiant lyrics led to it becoming the band's signature song, and has been used widely at sporting events and political protests internationally."@en ;

It appears in two variations there: one the well-known, seven-minute version; the other a reprise, titled \"Isn't It a Pity (Version Two)\". Harrison wrote the song in 1966, but it was rejected for inclusion on releases by the Beatles. In many countries around the world, the song was also issued on a double A-side single with \"My Sweet Lord\". In America, Billboard magazine listed it with \"My Sweet Lord\" when the single topped the Hot 100 chart, while in Canada, \"Isn't It a Pity\" reached number 1 as the preferred side. An anthemic ballad and one of Harrison's most celebrated compositions, \"Isn't It a Pity\" has been described as the emotional and musical centrepiece of All Things Must Pass and \"a poignant reflection on The Beatles' coarse ending\". Co-produced by Phil Spector, the recording employs multiple keyboard players, rhythm guitarists and percussionists, as well as orchestration by arranger John Barham. In its extended fadeout, the song references the closing refrain of the Beatles' 1968 hit \"Hey Jude\". Other musicians on the recording include Ringo Starr, Billy Preston, Gary Wright and the band Badfinger, while the reprise version features Eric Clapton on lead guitar. The song appeared as the closing track on Harrison's career-spanning compilation Let It Roll (2009), and a live version, from his 1991 tour with Clapton, was included on Live in Japan (1992). Clapton and Preston performed the song together at the Concert for George tribute in November 2002. \"Isn't It a Pity\" has been covered by numerous artists, including Nina Simone, Matt Monro, Cowboy Junkies, Paul Young, Elliott Smith, Galaxie 500, Jonathan Wilson and Graham Nash, Tedeschi Trucks Band, and Roberta Flack."@en ;

It was the first single to be released from her fourth album The Dreaming (1982), though it was issued 15 months prior to the album, which was nowhere near completion at that time. The single peaked at no. 11 in the UK Singles Chart. Musically, the single was faster and more percussive than Bush's previous releases. It features Preston Heyman on Drums recorded in the stone room at The Townhouse Studio 2 London and Paddy Bush and Preston on Whip like percussion actually played on bamboo canes swooshing through the air rhythmically. Critic Simon Reynolds called it \"an avant-pop stampede of pounding percussion and deranged shrieks, a sister-song to Public Image Ltd's \"Flowers of Romance.\" The lyrics of the song deal with feelings of existential frustration and the quest for knowledge. Kate Bush stated in an early interview that the single version was remixed slightly for inclusion on The Dreaming. The vocals were raised higher and the backing track altered to fit in better with the overall feel of the album.[citation needed] The demo version of \"Sat in Your Lap\" contains an extra verse at the start, which was later cut out of the song. As with subsequent singles from the album, a 12\" single was planned but was eventually withdrawn. The B-side to the single was a cover version (Bush's first) of \"Lord of the Reedy River\" by Donovan."@en ;

Like most of Rage Against the Machine's songs, the song's lyrics discuss social inequality, proclaiming that \"landlords and power whores\" were going to \"burn\". The intro riff was composed by Rage Against the Machine guitarist Tom Morello when he was playing with the band Lock Up, and, upon hearing it, they told him it was too \"heavy\". The song is one of three on the album in F# along with \"Know Your Enemy\" and \"Fistful of Steel\". It is one of the band's heaviest songs and incorporates subtle double kick flourishes which was rare for Brad Wilk. Impressed by their song, Rage Against the Machine named it Bombtrack in reference to hip hop terminology where the word 'bomb' means 'the greatest', making the song title literally mean 'the greatest track'. A music video was released, depicting support for the Peruvian Maoist guerrilla organization Sendero Luminoso and its leader Abimael Guzman. The video clip did not appear on the group's first home video, citing Rage's first altered political opinion. In 2003, the video finally appeared as bonus material on their Live at the Grand Olympic Auditorium DVD. The single artwork features Cuban photographer Alberto Korda's famous image of Che Guevara, Guerrillero Heroico. A mirrored version of the iconic two-tone portrait by Irish artist Jim Fitzpatrick, Guevara's face is further doctored in a way reminiscent of Andy Warhol's prints of Marilyn Monroe.[original research?] Perhaps the song's most notable appearance outside of the music industry would be its appearance in Oliver Stone's controversial film Natural Born Killers, when Mickey breaks out of his prison cell in search of Mallory."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"So You Want to Be a Rock 'n' Roll Star\" is a song by the American rock band The Byrds, written by Jim McGuinn and Chris Hillman and included on their 1967 album, Younger Than Yesterday. The song was released as a single on January 9, 1967 (see 1967 in music) and reached #29 on the Billboard Hot 100 but failed to chart in the United Kingdom. The song was inspired by the hype surrounding the creation of The Monkees, whose television series had recently debuted in America and had launched the pre-fabricated band to international fame. The manufactured nature of the group caused Hillman and McGuinn to look upon the current state of the pop world with more than a little cynicism."@en ;

It reached number 5 in the UK charts, the group's highest placed single along with \"Buck Rogers\". The song features backing vocals from Fran Healy and Dougie Payne from Travis, who both sing the backing vocals in the final chorus. It was revealed by Healy that the band were recording what would be their fifth studio album The Boy With No Name in a nearby studio room. At the same time Feeder were recording what would be Pushing the Senses and ended up working with Feeder for this track. CD1 of the single features the popular \"Shatter\", which was later released as a single itself after a fans petition was put forward, and was planned to be on the album but was finally not included as the record company believed it wouldn't fit in with the feel of the rest of the album, despite Grant Nicholas' protests. Despite reaching the top 5 and equaling \"Buck Rogers\" chart placing, it would become the smallest selling top 5 single of the 2000s, with sales of 19,400.[citation needed]"@en ;

Jackson's version of \"Gone Too Soon\" was dedicated to the memory of Jackson's friend Ryan White, a teenager from Kokomo, Indiana who came to national attention, after being expelled from his school for having HIV/AIDS. This version was produced by Jackson and co-produced by Bruce Swedien for Jackson's eighth studio album, Dangerous (1991). The song was also mixed by Swedien, and featured instrumentation by artists such as David Paich, Steve Porcaro, Michael Boddicker, Abraham Laboriel and Paulinho Da Costa. The song was released on December 1, 1993, as the ninth and final single from the Dangerous album. Following its release\u2014on World AIDS Day of 1993\u2014\"Gone Too Soon\" became a moderate chart success in several countries: France, Germany, The Netherlands, New Zealand, Switzerland and the UK. The song was released as a cassette single in the US, and became a hit in Zimbabwe, where it charted at number 3. \"Gone Too Soon\" was not a significant critical success, as it received mixed reviews from music critics. \"Gone Too Soon\" was promoted with a music video directed by Bill DiCicco, which showed footage of Jackson and White together, as well as scenes from the latter's funeral. A live performance by Jackson at Bill Clinton's inaugural celebration also served as a promotional platform, for both the song and AIDS-related funding. \"Gone Too Soon\" later received more exposure, following the deaths of both Diana, Princess of Wales, and Jackson himself."@en ;

As with \"November Spawned a Monster\", Morrissey chose to write about a subject unusual in pop music, namely male prostitution around the Piccadilly area of London. The title of the song refers to the cant slang language polari, first used by male prostitutes in the 19th century and then taken up by homosexuals in the 1960s to disguise sexual predilections which were illegal in the UK until 1967. It was also used in the BBC radio comedy Round the Horne by the characters Julian and Sandy. The voice featured in the background of the song belongs to Suggs, the lead singer of the band Madness.

	dbo:abstract	"\"Driving in My Car\" is a single by Madness. It was released on 24 July 1982, and spent eight weeks on the UK Singles Chart, peaking at number four. It reached number 20 on the Australian Singles Chart. From the video and most of the lyrics, the track is about a Morris Minor that was used by the group in the early years before the band became famous as seen in the film Take It or Leave It. The lyrics, however, do take some artistic license,[citation needed], as the Morris Minor was not built by the Tyne, it was built at Cowley, Oxfordshire. The B-side to the single was \"Animal Farm\", a mostly instrumental reworking of the song \"Tomorrow's Dream\". The 12\" release of the single included the song \"Riding on My Bike\", which is basically a rewording of the main track, sung by Lee Thompson. \"Driving in My Car\" was the 13th in a run of 20 consecutive UK top 20 hits for Madness, and is the only one of those 20 never to have been officially released on a Madness album in the USA. It was later included on the 2010 re-release of the band's 1982 album The Rise and Fall, as well as its two B-sides. The song was adapted for one of the band's adverts for Honda Japan, along with \"In the City\". The advert is included in the video version of Divine Madness.[citation needed]"@en ;

It's N.O.R.E.'s first venture into the increasingly popular Latin genre reggaeton. In a 2004 interview with MTV, N.O.R.E. says of the single, \"I fell in love with this music. I did this joint originally for a mixtape. The Latino people haven't been spoken to in a while, since [Big] Pun died. They haven't felt like they had something proud [in hip-hop] to stand on, so being both Latin and black, I wanted to rep my Latin side for once. Why not do it with this new music, instead of doing a Spanish rap record?

It is the fourth single from Dupr\u00E9's debut album Refaire le monde, released on October 18, 2005. \"Tout pr\u00E8s du bonheur\" was composed in 2000 by Dion for Dupr\u00E9 and Anne-Marie Angelil's wedding. Dion performed it after the ceremony. During the recording of his first album in 2005, Dupr\u00E9 asked Dion for permission to cover the song. The mother-in-law accepted it at once and recorded background vocals. Tino Izzo produced the track. Dupr\u00E9 collaborated with Dion already in the past. He was the opening act for her concerts at the Paris Olympia in 1994. They also performed a live duet in April 2002 on \"Sous le vent.\" It was during the widely popular Quebec karaoke game show, La fureur, held at the Bell Centre in Montreal and broadcast on Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. There are two recorded versions of \"Tout pr\u00E8s du bonheur.\" First can be found on Dupr\u00E9's debut album, released in 2005. Second one, rock version, was released as a radio and digital download in Quebec in 2006. There is also third but only live version of that song. It was performed on April 30, 2006 by both artists at the Gala Artists in Quebec and featured more vocals from Dion (a whole second verse). On December 22, 2006, Dion and Dupr\u00E9 performed the latter version also during his concert at the Lionel-Groulx Theater in Sainte-Th\u00E9r\u00E8se, Quebec, and later during Dion's historic performance in front of 250,000 spectators to celebrate Quebec's 400th anniversary, which was included on C\u00E9line sur les Plaines DVD. The music video was supposed to be shot in the Mojave Desert but because of Dion's health conditions it was directed May 8, 2006 at The Colosseum at Caesars Palace, Las Vegas by Ivan Grbovic. \"Tout pr\u00E8s du bonheur\" topped the Quebec radio charts in June 2006 for three weeks.

It was released in June 2003 as the lead single from their album It's Never Easy Being Cheesy. The song was highly successful on the UK Singles Chart, reaching number two in the official charts. The song also achieved chart success worldwide and reached number twenty-four on the Irish Charts and number fifty-six on the Australian ARIA Charts. The song was co-written and produced by Mike Stock. The lyrics were mildly controversial for supposedly promoting the excessive consumption of fast food by children, which is why some UK-based radio stations will not play the song when it is requested. Another version, \"De Pizzadans\", recorded by Dynamite, had been a hit in Belgium. The song has also been used in many advertising campaigns in the United Kingdom, for fast food restaurants, especially around the time of the release. Many people have seen the song as promotional towards the chains, and see it as more of an advert than a song. The band are widely considered to be one-hit wonders, though their two follow up singles \"Smile Please\" and \"I Love Christmas\" both achieved mild success in the UK Singles Chart reaching number 10 and 25 respectively. One version was written for Butlins, where the lyrics were changed."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"Baby Got Back\" is a hit song written and recorded by American artist Sir Mix-a-Lot, from his album Mack Daddy. The song samples the 1986 Detroit techno single \"Technicolor\" by Channel One. At the time of its original release, the song caused controversy with its outspoken and blatantly sexual lyrics about women, as well as specific references to the female buttocks which some people found objectionable. The video was briefly banned by MTV. \"Baby Got Back\" has remained popular and even anthemic since it was originally featured on the album Mack Daddy in 1992. It was the second best-selling song in the US in 1992, behind Whitney Houston's \"I Will Always Love You\", with sales of 2,392,000 physical copies that year. In 2008, it was ranked number 17 on VH1's 100 Greatest Songs of Hip Hop."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"I'll Be in Trouble\" is a 1964 hit single by The Temptations for the Gordy (Motown) label. Written by Miracles lead singer Smokey Robinson, the single was a Top 40 hit on the Billboard Hot 100, peaking at number 33. This single was the follow-up to \"The Way You Do the Things You Do\", with falsetto Eddie Kendricks as the main lead, the group's bass singer, Melvin Franklin, also has got a lead part on the bridge. As the song's narrator, Kendricks asks his lover to always stay with him, telling her \"no matter what you do or say, I know I'm gonna love you anyway\", and if she leaves anyway \"I'll Be in Trouble.\" Known for creating repetitive follow-ups, Motown at this time was relying on a formula to create songs with a similar sound that would be present in records by their various recording artists. Sure enough this song does have a similar sound as the previous single, and the label hope it would repeat (and surpass) the success of \"The Way You Do the Things You Do\". The single was issued with \"The Girl's Alright with Me\", also led by Kendricks, as its B-side. As such it is one of the handful of singles by The Temptations where both sides charted (it peaked at 2 on the Billboard Bubbling Under Hot 100 charts). However, as it was only a Top 40 Pop hit, it did not meet with the expected degree of success, and producer/songwriter Norman Whitfield would be given the next single (the Kendricks led \"Girl (Why You Wanna Make Me Blue)\"). When it also failed to hit the desired placing on the Pop charts, Robinson would return as The Temptations producer beginning with \"My Girl\". Both sides of this single would later appear on the group's 1965 album The Temptin' Temptations. The song was later covered by The Marvelettes in the early 1970s, with group member Wanda Young Rogers as lead; their version appears on the album The Return of the Marvelettes."@en ;

While working with Timbaland and Danja at The Hit Factory in Miami, Florida, Pharrell Williams introduced her to reggaeton, a musical genre that was unfamiliar to her. After he played a song for her, Furtado became inspired and wrote the lyrics to \"No Hay Igual\" \"nearly on the spot\". It is a hip hop and reggaeton song in which Furtado sings in Spanish and raps in Portuguese over a reggaeton rhythm. \"No Hay Igual\" was released as the lead single of Loose on 11 April 2006 by Geffen Records. It received generally positive reviews from music critics with some of them calling the song a highlight on Loose and praising its production. A music video for the remix of \"No Hay Igual\" with Calle 13 was shot in La Perla, San Juan, Puerto Rico. The video features Furtado and P\u00E9rez characters in various situations throughout the slum astride such as eating ice cream and playing pool. Furtado performed a medley of \"No Hay Igual\" with \"Party\" (Whoa, Nelly!, 2002) on the Get Loose Tour in 2007.

In 2004 Donovan would reveal that the song was entitled for the actress Lotte Lenya and that the song's lyric, addressed to a societally marginalized woman, was Donovan's reaction to Lenya's character in the film version of The Threepenny Opera: \"she's a streetwalker, but in the history of the world, in all nations, women have taken on various roles from priestess to whore to mother to maiden to wife. This guise of sexual power is very prominent, and therein I saw the plight of the character. Women have roles thrust upon them and make the best they can out of them, so I'm describing the character Lotte Lenya is playing, and a few other women I've seen during my life, but it's a composite character of women who are outcasts on the edge of society.\" \"Lale\u00F1a\" was recorded in a September 1968 session at Olympic Studios produced by Mickie Most, session personnel being Harold McNair on flute, Bobby Orr on drums, Danny Thompson on bass with the Royal Philharmonic strings; John Cameron was the arranger. Donovan was not working toward an album when he recorded \"Lale\u00F1a\", having completed the tracks which would comprise his The Hurdy Gurdy Man album in April 1968; that album and the single \"Lale\u00F1a\" both were issued in the US in October 1968 (Donovan was at this time unable to have product released in the UK due to a contractual dispute). The single was also a hit in France reaching #22. \"Lale\u00F1a\" made its first album appearance in 1969 on Donovan's Greatest Hits and was a bonus track on the 2005 CD release of The Hurdy Gurdy Man. In 1975 Donovan recorded in Munich a version of \"Lale\u00F1a\" with Marc Bolan which has been lost. In 1978 a bootleg emerged which featured Donovan performing \"Lale\u00F1a\" in a studio with Paul McCartney on acoustic guitar: this tape was likely made November 1968 at EMI Studios London where McCartney was producing tracks for Mary Hopkin's Postcard, an album on which Donovan played guitar. The song has also been recorded by Deep Purple on their 1969 Deep Purple album, by Helena Vondr\u00E1\u010Dkov\u00E1 (in Czech) on her 1970 album Ostrov Heleny Vondr\u00E1\u010Dkov\u00E9 and by Jane Olivor on her 1977 album Chasing Rainbows."@en ;

It is the band's first song release that did not include the exclamation mark at the end of the \"Panic\" in their name, and was also the first song written for the album. The video was filmed on December 20 and December 21. It was the first song written after the band decided to scrap an entire album of songs they had been planning to release in the autumn of 2007. Panic at the Disco's first performance of \"Nine in the Afternoon\" was at Virgin Festival 2007. The song has gone under changes in key and lyrics since first being performed. This song was number 44 on Rolling Stone's list of the 100 Best Songs of 2008. On January 28, 2008 at 9:00pm, Panic at the Disco released \"Nine in the Afternoon\" on their MySpace page. Soon after, the band removed the song from their MySpace page and added a demo of another song from the new album, \"We're So Starving\". The following day, Apple added the single for download. As of March, \"Nine in the Afternoon\" has received moderate radio airplay. It has also been featured in the episode of the NBC television series Heroes titled \"Cautionary Tales\" and was included in the official television soundtrack album released in early 2008. The song was covered by The Academy Is..., fellow Decaydance band, on Warped Tour 2008. The song is also a playable song in the music video game Rock Band 2. It was also included on the soundtrack for the video game NHL 09, and was released as downloadable content for the games Just Dance 2 and Lips. It is also featured on the guitar game Guitar Rock Tour 2. On the deluxe LP of Pretty. Odd., the song doesn't have the cymbal hit from the previous track. Instead, it starts right away with piano. The song's title comes from a happening during a practice session. After playing for a while and not knowing what time it was, Spencer suggested that it was \"seven in the afternoon.\" It was later changed to \"nine in the afternoon\" to mesh better with the other lyrics. On the spine of the Australian CD single, the title of the song was misprinted as \"Nine in the Morning\"."@en ;

The music video sees Girls Aloud seduce guests at a dinner party in elaborate costumes inspired by Marie Antoinette and 18th century French fashions. \"Can't Speak French\" was promoted through numerous live appearances and has since been performed on all of Girls Aloud's subsequent tours.

According to lead singer Reggie Youngblood the track was inspired by Jacksonville's dance party scene: he realized that usually he would end up with girls who couldn't dance. The song is noted for its 'trans-curious' lyrics, specifically the line \"You are the girl, that I've been dreaming of, ever since I was a little girl\". According to Reggie's sister and bandmate Ali Youngblood, this is based on an inside joke between the two of them where they would refer to wanting something \"Ever since I was a little girl\"."@en ;

It was recorded andreleased on Perry's Street Talk album in 1984, his first solo album which he released while still a member of Journey. The song is often regarded as an \"honorary\" Journey song, being credited to the band on several hit compilation albums and in other media, largely due to its resemblance to the band's trademark sound, as well as their performances of the song on the Raised on Radio Tour, which proved to be Perry's live swansong with the band. The song was Perry's biggest hit as a solo artist and written for his then-girlfriend Sherrie Swafford, who also appeared in the music video. The song hit number three on the pop chart and number one on the rock chart in the United States, partly aided in its success by a music video released to promote the song, which received heavy airplay on MTV. Two of the song's co-writers and supporting musicians, Bill Cuomo and Craig Krampf, earlier performed on Kim Carnes' signature song \"Bette Davis Eyes\" in 1981. Cuomo, who performed the keyboard riff on \"Oh Sherrie,\" was the musician responsible for the keyboard riff on \"Bette Davis Eyes\", and Krampf was the drummer on both tracks. Cuomo, Krampf and Perry had started composing the song at approximately midnight with little more than the simple chorus of \"Oh Sherrie\" and \"Hold on, hold on\" plus a few simple sounds. Sherrie Swafford had been in the room with them initially, but had gone to sleep because of the late hour."@en ;

dbr:Bang-A-Boomerang	rdf:type	dbo:MusicalWork ;
	dbo:abstract	"\"Bang-A-Boomerang\" is a song by ABBA, first released by Svenne & Lotta (both Swedish and English-language versions). The track was first recorded as a demo with English lyrics (but without any recorded vocals) in September 1974 by the ABBA musicians for their forthcoming eponymous album ABBA. The song was written by Benny Andersson, Bj\u00F6rn Ulvaeus and Stig Anderson and at one point had the working title \"Stop and Listen to Your Heart\". The lyrics compare the \"message of love\" with the returning boomerangs which the Australian Aborigines developed. In late 1974 Andersson, Ulvaeus and Anderson were invited by Sveriges Television as composers to submit a song to the 1975 melodifestivalen. Since ABBA themselves did not want to compete in the contest again, just one year after having won, they instead gave the opportunity and the song to Polar Music labelmates Svenne & Lotta. \"Bang-A-Boomerang\" was given new Swedish lyrics by Stig Anderson and retitled \"Bang en Boomerang\" and the duo subsequently made a vocal recording of the track in November 1974 - produced by Bj\u00F6rn & Benny - with a different arrangement, most noticeably slightly shorter (2:50) than the original demo, to fit the Eurovision three-minute rule. The song finished 3rd in the Swedish preselections in February 1975, became one of Svenne & Lotta's biggest hits and spent 7 weeks on the Svensktoppen radio chart during the period 9 March-11 May 1975, with a 2nd place as best result. Svenne & Lotta also recorded the song with the original English lyrics, both versions were included on their 1975 album Svenne & Lotta 2/Bang-A-Boomerang (Polar POLS 259). The English version was also released as a single in Denmark and became a big seller there, from a Scandinavian perspective the track is therefore still primarily seen as a hit single and Melodifestivalen classic by Svenne & Lotta. Under the name of \"Sven & Charlotte\", their original English version was also released in most European countries, and in Oceania, charting in several. ABBA then re-recorded their English-language version of the song in the Spring of 1975, using the Svenne & Lotta backing track - reputedly to the surprise of the duo, included it on their ABBA album and later also released it as a single in France on 21 April 1975, with \"SOS\" as B-side, where it was a minor hit. Although the track was included on the band's first Greatest Hits album, released on 17 November 1975, the ABBA version was in fact never issued as a single in Scandinavia."@en ;

It was released on September 9, 2008, by RCA Records as the only single from the album. The song was written and produced by Linda Perry, with additional songwriting from Aguilera. After giving birth to her son Max, she looked to \"come up with something new and fresh\", developing a \"futuristic\" era of her career. \"Keeps Gettin' Better\" is an electroclash and electropop song, and was inspired by the likes of Andy Warhol and Goldfrapp. Its lyrics portray Aguilera as a superhero. Upon its release, \"Keeps Gettin' Better\" received generally mixed reviews from music critics. At a time when dance music was becoming increasingly prominent, the song was criticized for its lack of originality, but was deemed \"catchy\" and a welcome change from Aguilera's fifth studio album Back to Basics (2006). It became Aguilera's highest debut on the US Billboard Hot 100 at number seven. The song additionally topped the US Hot Dance Club Play chart. Elsewhere, it peaked at number four in Canada, while charting inside the top twenty in Austria, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Slovakia and the United Kingdom. The accompanying music video, directed by Peter Berg, features Aguilera in an editing room, producing the music video on a green screen. Using the equipment there, she creates several characters, including a blonde 1960's inspired hippie character, another based on Catwoman and a futuristic blue-haired version of herself. Aguilera debuted the song during a live performance at the 2008 MTV Video Music Awards. Wearing a catsuit, she sang a remixed version of her debut single \"Genie in a Bottle\" (1999), before performing \"Keeps Gettin' Better\". Aguilera also performed the song during a promotional tour for the album, and as part of a medley of her greatest hits on the 36th Annual American Music Awards."@en .

	dbo:abstract	"\"Disco 2000\" is a hit single by British band Pulp, released in 1995. It reached No. 7 in the UK Singles Chart. It was the third single from the album Different Class, following \"Common People\" and the double A-side \"Mis-Shapes\"/\"Sorted for E's & Wizz\", both of which reached No. 2. The song tells the story of a narrator falling for a childhood friend called Deborah, who is more popular than he is and wondering what it would be like to meet again when they are older. The song is based on true events. Pulp frontman Jarvis Cocker said \"the only bit that isn't true is the woodchip wallpaper.\" Deborah was based on a real life childhood friend of Cocker's, Deborah Bone, who moved away from Sheffield to Letchworth when she was 10. As the lyrics suggest, she did marry and have children. It is believed that the fountain referred to as the meeting place was Goodwin Fountain, formerly located on Fargate, in Sheffield city centre. The song's riff is said to be influenced by Laura Branigan's 1980s hit \"Gloria\". Due to its millennial subject matter, Pulp removed the song's synchronisation licence, effectively banning the song from being used in TV and radio trailers throughout 1999 and 2000."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"Porpoise Song (Theme from Head)\" is a song written by Gerry Goffin and Carole King and performed by pop/rock quartet The Monkees on their album Head. The song was commissioned by Bob Rafelson, the director and producer of the film Head. The song was released as a single in 1968, and reached #62 on the Billboard Hot 100. The single version runs over a minute longer than the album version. The song\u2019s lyrics and melody echoes the psychedelic vibe of mid-1960s rock music. Micky Dolenz provides the vocals, which are distorted by echoing effect, and a mix of organ riffs, cello, string-bass, woodwinds and horns float in and out of the tune. The lyrics call into question the order of the world and one\u2019s place therein, and there are also veiled in-joke references to Dolenz\u2019s childhood work as the star of the television series Circus Boy. The song was produced by its co-writer Gerry Goffin on 26, 28 and 29 February 1968. The track includes chimes, tubular bells and aquatic sound effects. \"Without a doubt, this is the most elaborate production ever for a Monkees recording.\" According to Bob Rafelson: In the Monkees' 1968 feature film Head, the song appears at the beginning and the end of the production. At the start of the film, the group are being chased after, running onto a bridge. In an attempt to escape, Dolenz jumps from the bridge as the others look on in shock. As Dolenz sinks, he's saved from drowning by a couple of beautiful mermaids. At the end of the film, the other members follow Dolenz and jump from the bridge. As they appear to swim to shore, they end up in a large water tank. Solarization visual effects are used on screen to mirror the psychedelic nature of the song\u2019s lyrics. The song also appears on several \"greatest hits\" albums by The Monkees. It was featured in Vanilla Sky, a 2001 film with Tom Cruise, Pen\u00E9lope Cruz and Cameron Diaz, and Season 6 episode 12 (\"The Quality of Mercy\") of Mad Men."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"Swagga Like Us\" is a song by American hip hop recording artists T.I., Kanye West, Jay-Z, and Lil Wayne.

The song was produced by West and is constructed primarily around a vocal sample of \"Paper Planes\" by British musician M.I.A. \"Swagga like Us\" received mostly mixed reviews from music critics: whilst many complimented T.I.'s performance and the production, most denounced the other three rappers' performances as lyrically uninspired and overly brash, with Wayne and West also singled out for criticism from the perceived overuse of Auto-Tune in their vocals. Commercially, however, the song was a success despite a premature leak to the internet: it debuted and peaked at number five on the US Billboard Hot 100, and also charted modestly in a few overseas territories. It was nominated for Best Rap Song and Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group at the 51st Grammy Awards, winning the latter: the four rappers, alongside M.I.A. herself, also performed \"Swagger Like Us\" and the original \"Paper Planes\" during the ceremony."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"Love Is Noise\" is a song by English alternative rock band The Verve and is the second track on their fourth album, Forth. It was released as the first single from the album on 3 August 2008 as a digital download, with the physical release on 11 August 2008 in the United Kingdom (see 2008 in British music). The song received its first airplay by Zane Lowe on BBC Radio 1 on 23 June 2008. The promo video for the song debuted on the band's MySpace on 9 July. Richard Ashcroft stated that lyrically the song is a take off of William Blake's \"And did those feet in ancient time\", commonly known as 'Jerusalem'. Whereas in Blake's song the title verse is \"and did those feet in ancient time. Walk upon England's mountains green?\" Love is Noise asks: \"Will those feet in modern times / Walk on soles that are made in China?\", and allusion to \"Bright prosaic malls\" instead of \"dark Satanic mills\". This is the second time Richard Ashcroft has referenced Blake, following 1995's \"History\".[citation needed] \"Love Is Noise\" derived from another song off the album, \"Columbo\". While recording that track Richard created a new loop on a vocoder and added it to the song. \"Columbo\" was practically a jam the band had been working on for a couple of days. After that loop was added, all the band started adding some stuff on to it until finally, it evolved into a different track. The song has been played live as early as the late 2007 gigs, but was given different names such as \"Modern Times\", \"Love is Pain\", \"Love is noise (with boy)\". The band played it with a huge warm reception at 2008's Coachella as the setlist's closer, something that was repeated in Glastonbury's Pyramid Stage on 29 June. The video for the song was released on the band's MySpace. The video mixes up shots of the band performing in a dimly-lit room, with frontman Richard Ashcroft sitting on the floor, with montages of other images, including snow-capped mountains, a North Korean choreography, a couple about to kiss, a dancer and a blonde woman with an eagle. The single debuted in the UK Singles Chart at #5 after its first week of release via online download alone. The following week the song peaked at #4 and stayed 5 weeks in the UK Top 10. It marked a great return for The Verve, charting as their third UK Top 5 single and their fourth to crack the UK Top 10. It had great success around Europe, charting on the Top 20 for 6 weeks so far.

	dbo:abstract	"\"I'm Like a Lawyer with the Way I'm Always Trying to Get You Off (Me & You)\", or for short \"I'm Like a Lawyer... (Me & You)\" is a song by American rock band Fall Out Boy, and is the fourth and last single from their third studio album, Infinity on High (2007). With music composed by Fall Out Boy vocalist and guitarist Patrick Stump and lyrics penned by bassist Pete Wentz, the song was one of the two tracks produced by Babyface (who was referenced in the song), the other being single \"Thnks fr th Mmrs\". This song was played on VH1's V-Spot acoustic sessions along with \"Thnks fr th Mmrs\", \"This Ain't a Scene, It's an Arms Race\", and \"Sugar, We're Goin Down\", all of which were successful singles. Wentz characterized Stump\u2019s vocal performance on the song as \"straight-up Motown\", continuing to say \"If there wasn't a rock band playing, it'd be straight R&B, and he'd go on tour with just an upright bass and a drum and open up for R. Kelly.\" Lyrically, the song has been described as \"about as close to a love song as you'll get from this band, a rare moment of tenderness among songs about blog entries, guest lists, and therapy sessions. In Australia, the single reached No. 28 on the Australian ARIA singles chart, becoming the fourth consecutive top 30 single from the album in that region. In the US it was much less successful and only managed to reach No. 68 on the Billboard Hot 100 but received moderate mainstream airplay."@en ;

It was released as a 2-CD set and on cassette, but promotional copies on 12\" vinyl exist. The single managed to chart at number forty-six in Australia, ninety-nine in Germany and eleven in the UK Singles Chart. The song was featured on the Cruel Intentions soundtrack. There are two versions of the video, both filmed live at London's Brixton Academy; one includes clips from the movie Cruel Intentions. It was voted from a poll of 500,000 votes to be ranked number 83 on the list of the Hottest 100 of All Time in July 2009, conducted by Australian radio station Triple J. Croatian metal band Ashes You Leave covered \"Every You Every Me\" on their 2009 album Songs of the Lost. Along with the rest of the album (apart from \"Pure Morning\"), \"Every You Every Me\" was recorded in early 1998 at Real World Studios with Steve Osborne. When asked who it was about, Molko replied with \"Who's it about? I'm not really too sure just yet. I think it's about a lot of people. Probably anybody... everybody who's had the displeasure of sleeping with me.\" About his choice to include it in the Cruel Intentions soundtrack, Molko said that he \"studied drama, I know the original (Dangerous Liaisons) and we watched it on the tour bus when they wanted to use our song. I said: 'If he doesn't die in the end, if it's a happy ending, we don't do it.' It's quite perverted and manipulative, so the theme of the song fits in quite well.\" The song was also used in EA Sports F1 2000."@en ;

Even though it didn't peak at number 1, it stayed on the countdown for 51+ days.On March 8, 2007, rapper Bow Wow announced that he is featured on the remix of the single, along with R&B singer T-Pain. The remix began receiving airplay in May of the same year. Another remix features Romeo. Although \"Pop, Lock & Drop It\" is a song about a dance move, it is debated whether it refers to the dance or the process of firing a handgun; \"pop, lock and drop it\" is sometimes used as a slang phrase to describe the process of the firing. This video was featured on MTV Jams on mid February 2007."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"Se Quiere, Se Mata\" (English: Is Wanted, Is Killed) is the sixth single released from Shakira's third album, Pies Descalzos (1996). Written and composed by herself, \"Se Quiere, Se Mata\" was a Top Ten Hit in Mexico and on the Billboard Hot Latin Tracks in the United States. The song laments the story of a young couple, Braulio and Dana, and their choice to have an abortion. Introduced as an innocent young couple well liked by their families, the two succumb to their sexual desires, and Dana becomes pregnant. However, rather than admit this to their families and neighbors, they choose to get an abortion. The abortion ultimately goes badly, resulting in Dana's death. The song title comes from the line \"...esta podrida ciudad donde lo que no se quiere se mata.\" (... this rotten city where what is not wanted is killed,) where Shakira laments the moralistic societal pressure that drives people to take drastic measures to keep the appearances. Note that the Spanish word \"quiere\" may mean either \"want\" or \"love\" and the song seems to use both meanings."@en ;

It was released as a single in the US and mainland Europe but not in the UK. It was released in the UK six months later as the B-side to \"Autumn Almanac\". The song is now available as a bonus track to their album Face to Face, and an alternate version was also released as a bonus track on the 2011 deluxe reissue of Something Else by the Kinks. \"Mister Pleasant\" is lyrically somewhat similar to the earlier track \"A Well Respected Man\", as it satirizes the heedless complacency of a nouveau riche who, for all his newfound worldly success, is but a foolish cuckold. Musically, the song has strong English Music Hall influences and a \"trad jazz\" backing that features a trombone and ragtime-style piano (played by Nicky Hopkins). Due to the Kinks' absence from American touring and the single's noncommercial sound, \"Mister Pleasant\" did not fare well in the US, only managing a peak of number 80\u2014their poorest showing since \"See My Friends\" failed to reach the Hot 100 in 1965\u2014despite being tapped as likely Top 20 material by Billboard magazine. The publication characterized it as a \"clever novelty\" piece, which \"should skyrocket the group back up to the top of Hot 100 once again.\" \"Mr. Pleasant\" was much more successful in Europe, particularly the Netherlands (where it reached number 2) and Belgium (number 3)."@en ;
