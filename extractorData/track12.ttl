It was released as the album's lead single on 17 September 2015. It was written by Goulding, Max Martin, Savan Kotecha and Ilya Salmanzadeh, and produced by Martin, Continuous and Ilya. \"On My Mind\" is a electropop and R&B song whose instrumentation consists of scratchy guitars, trap drums, slapped beats and sharp, syncopated electronica. Lyrically, \"On My Mind\" talks about a one night stand with someone the protagonist shouldn't be with, having a dichotomy between heart and head. Though firmly denied by Goulding, many critics considered it an answer song to Ed Sheeran's \"Don't\". The song received positive reviews from music critics, who praised it for being a radio-friendly song, as well as Goulding's delivery, with one critic calling it one of her best singles to date. Commercially, \"On My Mind\" became another top-ten hit in the United Kingdom, as well as in Australia and other five territories, while reaching the top 20 in other seven countries. In the United States, it has reached number 13 on the Billboard Hot 100. Its western-themed music video was inspired by the film Thelma & Louise and was directed by Emil Nava.

It was written by David Guetta, Savan Kotecha, Giorgio Tuinfort, Rami Yacoub, and Carl Falk, and produced by Falk, Yacoub, Ilya, Tuinfort, and Kotecha. The song was first released on the iTunes Store on August 22, 2014 as the second promotional single from the album. On February 10, 2015, the song was sent to the contemporary hit radio as the fifth and final single from the album. A French version of the song featuring French singer Kendji Girac, alternatively titled \"Attends-moi\", was released on February 16, 2015 only in France, Belgium and Switzerland. It is also included on the deluxe version of Girac's debut studio album Kendji (2015). An Italian version of the song featuring Italian rapper Fedez was released on May 26, 2015 only in Italy. \"One Last Time\" is a dance-pop and EDM song. Its instrumentation consists of sampled drums and a synth line. Lyrically, the song talks about reuniting one last time with a former lover, even though he has already moved on and has found her replacement. The song was well received by music critics, with praise going to Grande's vocals and the fact that the song shows her maturity and softer side not seen on her previous singles. \"One Last Time\" achieved moderate success on the charts, reaching the top 20 in 11 countries, including Australia, Canada, France and the United States, where it became Grande's sixth top 20 single on the US Billboard Hot 100. The song's accompanying music video was released on February 15, 2015 and was directed by Max Landis. The music video is visually presented as a found footage, similar to Landis' previous work. The video faced controversy due to its similarity to the music video for the Australian band SAFIA's single \"You Are the One\", with Grande and Landis being accused of intellectual property theft. Grande promoted the song with a live performance on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon, the 2015 NBA All-Star Game halftime show, and during her first world tour, The Honeymoon Tour."@en ;

The single was poorly received by the music press and the public: its highest chart position was No. 18, making it the first Morrissey single not to reach the British top 10. It appeared along with its B-side \"Yes, I Am Blind\" on the compilation album Bona Drag. A shorter edit, omitting a verse, appeared on the 2010 reissue of Bona Drag. The song is about the protagonist using a Ouija board to contact a dead friend, who tells him to \"push off\". It caused some debate in the press at the time over claims it promoted occult dabbling or devil worship. Morrissey replied to these claims by retorting \"The only contact I ever made with the dead was when I spoke to a journalist from The Sun.\" The video for the song, directed by Tim Broad, features Morrissey being led into the woods by some children who take him to see a spirit medium, played by Joan Sims, an actress famous for the Carry On films. The video also features an early appearance by Kathy Burke. It was filmed on location in and around the Elizabethan house Hook End Manor in Checkendon, Oxfordshire, the residential studio where the song was also recorded. The video ranked third on PULP Magazine's \"Most Tweaked Music Videos of All Time\" list. The music of the B-side \"Yes, I Am Blind\" was composed by his ex-Smiths' partner Andy Rourke.

	dbo:abstract	"\"Paparazzi\" is a song by American singer-songwriter Lady Gaga from her debut studio album, The Fame (2008). It was released as the fifth and final single by Interscope Records. Gaga wrote and produced the song with Rob Fusari. The song portrays Gaga's struggles in her quest for fame, as well as balancing success and love. Musically, it is an up-tempo dance-pop song whose lyrics describe a stalker following somebody to grab attention and fame. Although released on July 6, 2009, in the United Kingdom and four days later in Australia, \"LoveGame\" initially had been planned as the third single release in the former but deeming its lyrics and music video potentially controversial, it was decided that \"Paparazzi\" would be released instead. \"Paparazzi\" was critically acclaimed for its \"fun-filled\" and club-friendly nature. It was also commercially successful, reaching top-ten positions in the music charts of Australia, Canada, Ireland, the United Kingdom, and the United States and topping the charts in the Czech Republic and Germany. The accompanying music video portrays Gaga as a doomed starlet, hounded by photographers, who is almost killed by her boyfriend. It shows her survival, comeback, revenge on her boyfriend, and experiences on the way to fame. The video won two MTV Video Music Awards in 2009 for Best Art Direction and Best Special Effects. Gaga also performed the song at the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards in a performance art piece symbolizing the negative effect of fame leading to death. Additional live performances of the song include on The Fame Ball Tour, where it was the opening song, on an October 2009 episode of Saturday Night Live and on The Monster Ball Tour. On the first leg of the tour, she appeared as a Rapunzel-like character; from the second leg onward, she performed the song alongside a giant anglerfish (\"The Fame Monster\") who, attempting to devour her, was killed after her leotard shot sparks into the creature."@en ;

One of the three songs recorded for the compilation, it was released as its third and final single through RCA Records on April 8, 2013. Written by Meghan Kabir, James Michael, Blair Daly, and produced by Greg Kurstin, \"People Like Us\" is an uptempo pop song, with its lyrical content primarily dealing with themes of empowerment, acceptance, and assurance for the eccentrics, who were being dedicated to as \"people like us\". Upon Chapter One's release, \"People Like Us\" received positive reviews from music critics, many of whom complimented its lyrical content and Clarkson's vocal performance. In the United States, it has so far peaked on the Billboard Hot 100 at number 65 and has topped the Hot Dance Club Songs chart. It also charted on the Adult Pop Songs and Pop Songs charts. Internationally, \"People Like Us\" attained a top forty position in the national charts of Canada, New Zealand, Slovakia, South Korea, and Ukraine. Filmed by Chris Marrs Piliero, the accompanying music video for \"People Like Us\" is presented in a predominantly monochromatic atmosphere and featured Clarkson portraying an undercover scientist who furtively escapes an experimental subject with a full colored appearance into freedom. The video has met with positive reception from critics, who complimented its visual treatment and compared it to the 1998 film Pleasantville. Clarkson has performed the song in limited live performances, premiering it on the twelfth season of American Idol."@en ;

It remained at that position for two weeks, becoming their second chart-topping single of 1996 in Britain, following Killing Me Softly.

	dbo:abstract	"\"Run to You\" is a song performed by Whitney Houston and is the fourth single released from The Bodyguard: Original Soundtrack Album. \"Run to You\" was written by Jud Friedman and Allan Rich. Originally intended to be a break-up song, it was approved by the production and stars. However, a month later, the director of The Bodyguard (Mick Jackson) called, saying he liked the song so much, but he'd rather have it to be a love song so the entire song was rewritten, except for the title. All of the previous releases from The Bodyguard had been successes, landing in the top five. \"Run to You\" became a moderate hit, peaking at number 31 on the Billboard Hot 100. In the U.S., it spent six weeks inside the top 40, five of which were spent at the number 31 peak. Airplay and singles sales topped out at number 26 and 41, respectively. The single sales stalled at number 41 on the Hot 100 Singles Sales chart, most likely due to the fact its parent album, The Bodyguard, already was certified 8\u00D7 platinum and nearing 9\u00D7 platinum status quickly. Single sales were moderate because most consumers already owned the song by simply owning the album. On other Billboard charts, the song was moderately well received. On the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs, it reached a peak position of number 31. The song cracked the top 10 on the Hot Adult Contemporary Tracks chart, peaking at number 10. Internationally, it was not as well received, except in the UK and Ireland, peaking at number 15 and number 9, respectively. \"Run to You\" and its soundtrack-mate \"I Have Nothing\" were nominated for a 1992 Academy Award for Best Original Song, but they lost to \"A Whole New World\" from Aladdin. The music video for \"Run to You\" features scenes from The Bodyguard intercut with scenes of an angelic Houston running on clouds."@en ;

It is sung by Humphreys, who ordinarily functions as keyboard player and backing vocalist. The track has minimal lyrical content and is characterised by slowed-down choir sounds offset by pulsing major key piano chords. Its \"gentle, sparkling\" synthesizer hook substitutes for a vocal chorus, as with other OMD compositions. \"Souvenir\" became a major international hit for the band. Peaking at number 3 on the UK Singles Chart, it remains the group's highest-charting single in their home country, along with 1991's \"Sailing on the Seven Seas\". The song also reached the Top 10 in several European territories, including topping the charts in France, Spain and Portugal. Having gained little mainstream airplay in recent years, \"Souvenir\" has been hailed as a forgotten classic within popular music. The makers of the New Musical Express and Uncut, in the 2011 publication 501 Lost Songs, lauded the track as a \"classic piece of early '80s melancholy.\" Dave Thompson in AllMusic wrote: \"OMD at their most luminescent, 'Souvenir' was a permanent memento of the group's early power.\" Critic Ned Raggett praised Humphreys' vocal, as well as the mid-song instrumental break. Erasure vocalist Andy Bell has said that he is always moved to tears upon hearing \"Souvenir\"."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"Strawberry Wine\" is a song by the alternative rock band My Bloody Valentine. It was released as a non-album single on 9 November 1987 on Lazy Records. It was the band's second release for Lazy and the first release to feature vocalist and guitarist Bilinda Butcher, who was recruited in April 1987 following the departure of original vocalist David Conway. \"Strawberry Wine\" was released as a 12-inch single in a limited pressing of 2,500 copies. The contents of the single were later combined with My Bloody Valentine's following release, the mini album Ecstasy (1987), and reissued on the compilation album Ecstasy and Wine (1989). The compilation album was released without the band's consent and due to an error, an alternate mix of \"Strawberry Wine\" was used. Upon its release, \"Strawberry Wine\" received moderate critical acclaim and peaked at number 13 on the United Kingdom Independent Singles Chart. Critics, who compared and contrasted it to Ecstasy, referred to the single as \"certainly the better of the two releases\" and described the title track as \"still sounding in parts like the old Valentines with a strong Mamas & Papas type vocal line\". The single's B-sides were referred to as \"throwaways, except for the curiously different guitar style being heard for the first time.\" In Loveless, a book from the 33\u2153 series about the My Bloody Valentine album of the same name, Mike McGonial referred to \"Strawberry Wine\" as a \"rarified, effete and poppy approach to Byrdsian rock\"."@en ;

He recorded the song during March 1960, and the single was released within weeks and went to number one on the Billboard Hot 100 chart in late-April 1960, becoming his first number-one single of the 1960s and thirteenth overall. \"Stuck on You\" peaked at number six on the R&B chart. The song knocked Percy Faith's \"Theme from A Summer Place\" from the top spot, ending its nine-week run at number one on the chart. The record reached number three in the UK. The song was written by Aaron Schroeder and J. Leslie McFarland and published by Gladys Music, Elvis Presley's publishing company. In New Zealand (and perhaps other countries), the single had a special paper sleeve with the usual RCA logo top left and 45 R.P.M. bottom left and included, in large letters, \"ELVIS\" top right and bottom left: \"Elvis' 1st new recording for his 50,000,000 fans all over the world.\"[citation needed]"@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"Sunshine Superman\" is a song written and recorded by Scottish singer-songwriter Donovan. The \"Sunshine Superman\" single was released in the United States through Epic Records (Epic 5-10045) in July 1966, but due to a contractual dispute the United Kingdom release was delayed until December 1966, where it appeared on Donovan's previous label, Pye Records (Pye 7N 17241). The \"Sunshine Superman\" single was backed with \"The Trip\" on both the United States and United Kingdom releases. It has been described as having, \"proven to be [one of the] classics of the era,\" and as, \"the quintessential bright summer sing along\". \"Sunshine Superman\" reached the top of the Billboard Hot 100 in the United States, and subsequently became the title track of Donovan's third album, Sunshine Superman. A different mix of \"The Trip\" (without harmonica) is also included in the album. It was the first product from the highly successful three-year collaboration between Donovan and producer Mickie Most and is generally considered to be one of the first examples of the musical genre that came to be known as psychedelia. The song features styles of psychedelic folk, psychedelic rock and psychedelic pop. The song was written for Donovan's future wife Linda Lawrence. The lyrics of the song mention not only Superman, but also another DC Comics superhero, Green Lantern. Chart positions were No. 1 , and No. 2 (the single was released in December 1966 in the UK). It was Donovan's only single to reach No. 1 on Billboard's Hot 100 survey."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"Tell Him\" is a duet between Barbra Streisand and Celine Dion. It was released on November 3, 1997 as the first single from Dion's Let's Talk About Love and Streisand's Higher Ground albums. On March 24, 1997 Dion became the first artist ever to perform twice on the same Academy Awards night. In addition to singing \"Because You Loved Me,\" she also sang \"I Finally Found Someone\" from the movie The Mirror Has Two Faces, recorded by Barbra Streisand and Bryan Adams. Streisand preferred not to perform that night and Natalie Cole had been scheduled to sing her song instead. But Cole pulled out and two days before the Oscar night, Dion was asked if she could do it. Although nervous, she accepted and managed to perform on the night. A few days later, Streisand sent Dion flowers and a note: \"I watched the tape afterwards, you sang my song beautifully and I regret I wasn't in the room to hear you, next time let's make one together. I really wish your song would have won, you are a wonderful singer.\" That note wasn't left without an answer and Ren\u00E9 Ang\u00E9lil called up David Foster to write a song for them, and the result was \"Tell Him.\" On October 7, 1997 \"Tell Him\" had its first runs on the United States radio waves. This duet was rejected however by non-adult contemporary radio stations. Even if the song was a large adult contemporary hit, Sony Music Entertainment cancelled the U.S. single release, because it did not have a broad enough support to put the song on top of the charts. However, \"Tell Him\" was a huge hit outside the U.S. A radio version of the song was commissioned. This version featuring a high-frequent flute playing during Dion's bridge. It was the opening track of the all releases of the song. The music video was directed by Scott Floyd Lochmus and premiered on VH1, on October 24, 1997. It was included as a bonus on the Au c\u0153ur du stade DVD. \"Tell Him\" peaked at number 1 in the Netherlands, number 2 in Ireland, number 3 in Belgium, France and the United Kingdom, number 4 in Italy and Switzerland, and was a top 10 hit in many other countries. The single has sold very well around the world, receiving platinum awards in the Netherlands (75,000), Belgium (50,000), and gold in the United Kingdom (400,000), France (400,000), Australia (35,000), Switzerland (25,000) and Norway (10,000). \"Tell Him\" was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals in 1998. Dion performed this song as a virtual duet with Barbra Streisand during the Let's Talk About Love Tour. However, Dion and Streisand never performed the song together live since recording it. \"Tell Him\" was later included on both artists' compilations: Dion's The Collector's Series, Volume One and Streisand's The Essential Barbra Streisand and Duets. In 2008, it became also a part of Dion's greatest hits My Love: Essential Collection."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"Tell Me a Lie\" is a song written by Mickey Buckins and Barbara Wyrick, and most notably recorded by American country music artist Janie Fricke. It was released in September 1983 as the fourth single from the album It Ain't Easy. In 1983, Janie Fricke picked up the song \"Tell Me a Lie\" as to be released as her next single in 1983. During this time, Fricke racked up a good amount of hits, like \"It Ain't Easy Bein' Easy\" and \"I Need Someone to Hold Me When I Cry\". The song had been originally recorded and released during the 1970s by country recording artist Lynn Anderson. The song had been released on Anderson's You're My Man album, which featured her number 1 hit single \"You're My Man\". However, because of the big success of \"You're My Man\", \"Tell Me a Lie\" was never released as a single by Anderson, probably because she had other songs that she'd wanted to release as singles. \"Tell Me a Lie\" would however become a Top 20 pop hit and a minor country hit for female singer Sami Jo in 1974. In 1981, Bettye LaVette recorded an R&B version of the song on Motown. It was released as the title track of her album the following year. Shortly thereafter, Fricke's record producer at the time Billy Sherrill, had suggested that Fricke would record the song. Listening to Sherrill, Fricke recorded the song in 1983. By this time though, Fricke had produced a number 1 hit in 1983 called \"It Ain't Easy Bein' Easy\". Fricke soon released \"Tell Me a Lie\" as a single on the country charts that year. By 1983, \"Tell Me a Lie\" was Janie Fricke's fourth number one hit on the Country charts. The song and its album that it was featured on titled It Ain't Easy became very successful and became one of Fricke's signature songs. Since the song's release, it has been included in numerous multi-artist compilation albums. Despite the song's pop production, as well as its success on the country charts, it did not reach the pop singles chart. In 2004, Fricke released a bluegrass album, entitled The Bluegrass Sessions, which featured remakes of Fricke's biggest hits. The album featured \"Tell Me a Lie\"."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"United We Stand\" is a song written by Tony Hiller and Peter Simmons. It was first released in 1970 by The Brotherhood of Man (in their original, pre-Eurovision line-up), becoming the band's first hit, peaking at #13 in the U.S., #9 in Canada, and #10 in the U.K. Billboard Magazine gave the song a favourable review on 14 March 1970 calling it a \"strong production\" and (correctly) predicting it would become a top 20 hit on the Billboard Hot 100. It has been recorded by over 100 different artists. In 1977, it was used as the closing theme song of the short-lived Brady Bunch Hour. Thirty years after the original 1970 hit it was popularised again by becoming a patriotic and spiritual anthem for many during the post 9/11 recovery. It has also been used as a football chant and by gay rights groups. Taken literally, the song's lyrics convey two lovers who tell each other that no matter what hardships come their way, they will always be together. In general terms, it relates a message of strength in unity. The song was later included on an album of the same name and was followed by another hit \"Where are You Going to My Love\". A sound-alike cover appeared on the 1970 album Top of the Pops, Volume 10. Irish Popstars winners Six also recorded a version which appears on their album. Phish closed out their 3 night stand at Dick's Sporting Goods Park in Commerce City, CO on September 6, 2015 to end a 7 song encore with the song, playing to 26,000 people in attendance and a live stream on the internet."@en ;

It was released on October 3, 2008 by Jive Records as the lead single of the album. Produced and co-written by Nikesha Briscoe and Rafael Akinyemi of The Outsyders, the song was re-recorded after a snippet was leaked onto the internet. \"Womanizer\" is an up-tempo electropop and dance-pop song with characteristic sirens and a repetitive hook. Described by Spears as a girl anthem, the song's lyrics recall a womanizing man, while the protagonist of the song makes clear she knows who he really is. \"Womanizer\" was well received by contemporary critics, with reviewers praising its hook, melody and empowering lyrics. Critics also observed it was a stand-out track from its album and also deemed it as a comeback single for Spears. \"Womanizer\" was a commercial success, peaking atop of the charts in Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Norway, Sweden and the United States. It also reached the top ten in every country it charted in also receiving several certifications from several countries. In the United States, \"Womanizer\" was her first single to reach number-one since \"...Baby One More Time\" in 1999. The song broke the record for the highest jump to number one at a time which was later broken by Kelly Clarkson's \"My Life Would Suck Without You\" in 2009. It is also her best-selling digital song in the country, having sold over 3.5 million copies. The music video, directed by Joseph Kahn, was created by Spears as a sequel to the music video of \"Toxic\". It portrays Spears as a woman who disguises herself in different costumes and follows her boyfriend through his daily activities to expose him in the end. The video also contains interspersed scenes of Spears naked in a steam room, as a response to the attacks she had received over the years about her weight. It received positive reviews and was considered as a return to form for Spears. The video was also nominated for two categories at the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards, and went on to win Best Pop Video. The song has been covered by a number of artists from different genres, including Lily Allen, Franz Ferdinand and Girls Aloud. Spears performed \"Womanizer\" on several television shows including The X Factor and Good Morning America, as well as award shows such as the 2008 Bambi Awards. She has also performed the song at The Circus Starring Britney Spears (2009), the Femme Fatale Tour (2011) and Britney: Piece of Me (2013). \"Womanizer\" received a Grammy nomination in 2010 in the Best Dance Recording category, but lost to Lady Gaga's \"Poker Face\"."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"Wrong Way\" is a 1997 single from Sublime's 1996 self-titled third album that fits squarely within the punk rock-inspired third wave ska movement of the 1990s. The song hit number 47 on the Billboard Hot 100 Airplay chart and it spent 26 weeks on Billboard's Alternative Songs chart, peaking at number 3. The lyrical content of the song refers to the life of a girl, named Annie, who was forced into prostitution by her family of \"seven horny brothers\" and her \"drunk-ass dad.\" She is soon rescued from a life of prostitution by the narrator of the song; an ironic twist is added in the lyrical references hinting that the narrator saved her and then regretted mistreating her himself. A video was made starring Bijou Phillips, soon after the band's lead singer, Bradley Nowell, died. The video also features a cameo by Mike Watt of the bands Minutemen, Firehose, Dos, and many others. Mike Watt was one of the biggest influences on bass player Eric Wilson. The song was featured in the video game Aggressive Inline, and is available as downloadable content for Rock Band 3 and Rocksmith 2014.

	dbo:abstract	"\"You're Not Alone\" is a song composed by recording artist Tinchy Stryder. The song was released as the fifth and final single from Stryder's second studio album, Catch 22 on 2 November 2009. On the week of the album's release, the track charted at No. 50 in the UK, based mostly on hype around the track which had received its first play on the BBC Radio 1 chart show the previous week. Tinchy Stryder performed the song at the MOBO Awards 2009 on 30 September, it then entered the top 40 on the UK Singles Chart on 10 October 2009 at number 32, next week on 17 October it climbed to number 14 in the UK, it dropped to number 15 in its 3rd week in the UK top 40. The song interpolates \"You're Not Alone\", a hit in 1997 for the band Olive. Olive claimed in an interview they would hope Tinchy Stryder would return the favour and collaborate with them on a song for their upcoming album. The song samples Leona Lewis' Run which in turn is a cover of the original performed by Snow Patrol.[citation needed]"@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"You Can't Win\" is an R&B, pop and soul song performed by American recording artist Michael Jackson, who played Scarecrow in the 1978 musical film The Wiz, an urbanized retelling of L. Frank Baum's The Wonderful Wizard of Oz. The movie featured an entirely African American cast and was based on the 1975 Broadway musical The Wiz. After the original soundtrack version was recorded, Michael Jackson and Quincy Jones went back into the studio and re-recorded the track. It was the re-recording that was released in January 1979 as the second single from The Wiz: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack, following the release of \"Ease On Down the Road\" in 1978, and was Michael's first solo chart single on Epic Records. The 7\" version included \"You Can't Win, parts 1 & 2\". The full length version was released on 12\" and was included on The Ultimate Collection in 2004. The single only charted in the United States, where it reached number 81 on the Billboard Hot 100 and number 42 on the R&B singles chart. Since its release, the song has been well received by music critics. The song has been performed by contemporary singers such as Jill Scott and Charles Grigsby. In 1982, part 2 of the song, in which Michael Jackson repeatedly sings \"Can't get outta the game\", was vocally overdubbed and retitled \"Can't Get Outta the Rain\"; it became the B-side of the first single of his landmark album Thriller: \"The Girl Is Mine\"."@en ;

Written and produced by Dr. Luke along with Cathy Dennis and Steven Wolf, it was released on 24 September 2007 by Island Records as the lead single from the album, the first to feature Amelle Berrabah on all tracks. An uptempo pop track that combines heavy elements of pop rock, and dance-pop, it infuses light electronic sounds. Lyrically, \"About You Now\" finds the protagonist thinking deeply over her relationship with her love interest from whom she parted. The song was generally well received by music critics, who complimented its genre mixing production as well as its aurally remarkable US pop influence. Some of them also described the song as a \"pop-electro-rock masterpiece\" and called it the best Sugababes single in years. Upon its release, \"About You Now\" became the group's sixth UK number one hit and highest-charting single since 2005's \"Push the Button.\" It remained atop the UK Singles Chart for four weeks. It also reached the top of the charts in Hungary, as well as the top ten in Austria, Belgium, Germany, Ireland, Norway, and Spain. The Sugababes' highest-selling single to date, it has sold 540,500 copies as of October 2015. \"About You Now\" was nominated for a 2008 BRIT Award for Best British Single. In the 2009 edition of Guinness World Records, \"About You Now\" was listed as the \"first track by a British pop act to top the singles chart solely on downloads\". The song was also named as the \"biggest chart mover to the number one position in the UK\". In December 2009, it was revealed by BBC that \"About You Now\" was the UK's fifth most-played song of the decade (2000\u201309).

Written by Larry Parks and Jay Turnbow, \"Bread and Butter\" was the group's first and most popular hit, reaching #2 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart in September 1964 for two weeks, while attaining the same position on Cashbox for one week. The song reached #15 in the United Kingdom and #8 in Australia. It sold over one million copies in the United States, attaining a gold disc. \"Bread and Butter\" served as The Newbeats' demo in an effort to obtain a recording contract with Hickory Records. They were then asked to formally record the track for the label. The opening two-chord piano riff and the lead falsetto singing voice of Larry Henley are notable features of the song. Soon the song was sampled in the Dickie Goodman novelty song \"Presidential Interview (Flying Saucer '64)\". \"Bread and Butter\" was the inspiration for the advertising jingle of Schmidt Baking Company used in the 1970s and 1980s; it went: \"I like bread and butter, I like toast and jam, I like Schmidt's Blue Ribbon Bread, It's my favorite brand\". Devo covered the tune in 1986 for the soundtrack to the film 9\u00BD Weeks. A lyrically modified version of the song was used as the theme for the television series Baby Talk. The song features on the soundtrack to the 1998 comedy-drama film, Simon Birch, as well as in the 2004 Will Ferrell comedy, Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy. \"Bread and Butter\" was featured in The Brave Little Toaster Goes to Mars and in the Lizzie McGuire episode \"She Said, He Said, She Said\".

In 2012, after signing a publishing deal with Warner/Chappell Music and co-writing songs for artists including Girls Aloud and Icona Pop, Lo decided to become an independent singer to keep her most personal songs for herself. She eventually released her debut single \"Love Ballad\" to Swedish radio stations on 15 October 2012. The track was later included on Lo's debut extended play Truth Serum and her debut studio album Queen of the Clouds, both of which were released in 2014. \"Love Ballad\" is a pop song with drum instrumentation; its lyrics details the protagonist's exaggerated ways to show affection to a romantic partner. Critics described it as an \"ode to falling dangerously in love with someone\" and a parody of love songs. The song drew the attention of music blogs and received positive reviews from some critics but it failed to chart anywhere. A music video for the song, which was directed by Motellet Film and Lo, was released on 5 October 2012. It shows the singer covered in black paint and performing acrobatics in the middle of a road and on a football field.

The lyrics consist of Lewis informing her past lover that enough time has passed since their relationship for her to have moved on and to have developed as a person. Critics praised Lewis' vocal performance, likening the her technical abilities to those of Mariah Carey and Whitney Houston. The musical structure of the song was heavily compared to one of her previous singles, \"Bleeding Love\", along with songs performed by Adele. The accompanying music video shows Lewis trying to escape from a giant bird cage. To promote \"Lovebird\", Lewis performed the song on talk shows Daybreak and Loose Women in the United Kingdom, in addition to singing competition La Voz in Spain. Nonetheless, \"Lovebird\" sold fewer than 600 copies upon its release, failing to attain one of the top 200 chart positions on the UK Singles Chart; however, two weeks after the release of Glassheart, \"Lovebird\" peaked at number 22 on the South Korea Gaon Single Chart due to strong digital download sales."@en ;

It was released as a single in the United States on Freddie Mercury's 45th birthday, 5 September 1991, and as double A-side single in the UK three months later on 9 December, in the wake of Mercury's death, with the seminal Queen track \"Bohemian Rhapsody\". The single debuted at #1 on the UK Singles Chart, and remained at the top for five weeks. The song was awarded a BRIT Award for \"Best Single\" in 1992. \"These Are the Days of Our Lives\" hearkens back to similarly themed 1975 Queen song \"Love of My Life\", twice using the line \"I still love you\".

	dbo:abstract	"\"Young Hunting\" is a traditional folk song, Roud 47, catalogued by Francis James Child as Child Ballad number 68, and has its origin in Scotland. Like most traditional songs, numerous variants of the song exist worldwide, notably under the title of \"Henry Lee\" and \"Love Henry\" in the United States and \"Earl Richard\" and sometimes \"The Proud Girl\" in the United Kingdom. The song, which can be traced back as far as the 18th century, narrates the tale of the eponymous protagonist, Young Hunting, who tells a woman, who may have borne him a child, that he is in love with another, more beautiful woman. Despite this, she persuades him to drink until he is drunk, then to come to her bedroom, or at least kiss her farewell. The woman then stabs him to death. She throws his body in the river \u2014 sometimes with the help of one of the other women of the town, whom she bribes with a diamond ring \u2014 and is taunted by a bird. She tries to lure the bird down from the tree but it tells her that she will kill it if it comes within reach. When the search for Young Hunting starts, she either denies seeing him or claims that he left earlier, but when Hunting's remains are found, in order to revoke her guilt, she reveals that she murdered him and is later burned at the stake. Nick Cave, who covered the song, referred to the song as \"a story about the fury of a scorned woman.\""@en ;

Written and recorded as the theme for the 1985 James Bond movie of the same name, it became one of the band's biggest hits. It remains the only James Bond theme song to have reached number 1 on the US Billboard Hot 100; it also made it to number 2 for three weeks on the UK Singles Chart. In 1986, composer John Barry and Duran Duran were nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song for \"A View to a Kill\". The song was the last track recorded by the most famous five member lineup of Duran Duran until their 2001 reunion. It was performed by the band at Live Aid in Philadelphia, their final performance together before their first split. Following Barry's death, the band paid tribute as their encore at the 2011 Coachella Festival, Simon Le Bon reappearing in a tuxedo for a pared-down version backed by an orchestra, before launching into the full, upbeat track. Bassist John Taylor told the crowd: \"We lost a dear friend of ours this year \u2013 English composer John Barry. This is for him.\""@en ;

It has become one of Khan's signature songs. Rufus keyboardist David \"Hawk\" Wolinski wrote the song around a repeating synthesizer loop backed by a Linn LM-1 drum computer. However, drummer John J. R. Robinson played real drums for the recording session. The band did a democratic vote and they decided to include the song in their album repertoire. Once the song was recorded, Warner executives wanted to issue another song as the album's first single.[citation needed] Wolinski threatened to give the song to Michael Jackson and producer Quincy Jones for Thriller if the song was not the lead-off single. The label relented and \"Ain't Nobody\" was issued and hit number 1 on the R&B chart for the week ending October 15, 1983. The song was also included in the soundtrack of the movie Breakin'."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"Amor Prohibido\" (English: Forbidden Love) is a song recorded by American Tejano singer Selena for her fourth studio album, Amor Prohibido (1994). Released as the lead single by EMI Latin on April 13, 1994, \"Amor Prohibido\" was written by Selena alongside her brother-music producer A.B. Quintanilla and Selena y Los Dinos backup vocalist Pete Astudillo. Selena wanted to record a song about the true story of her grandparents\u2014who fell in love despite being of different social classes. Since its release, the lyrical content and themes explored on \"Amor Prohibido\" has fostered various opinions by authors, musicologists, and journalists who found themes similar to those facing the LGBT community while others expressed it to be a Romeo & Juliet-esque recording, among other popular interpretations of the song by the media. \"Amor Prohibido\" is a Mexican cumbia dance-pop song and received widespread acclaim with music critics citing the single as one of the most popular tracks recorded by Selena. The song peaked at number one on the United States Billboard Hot Latin Songs chart for nine consecutive weeks; her first as a solo act. It received the Tejano Music Award for the Single of the Year, Regional Mexican Song of the Year at the Lo Nuestro Awards and Billboard Latin Music Awards, and became the first Spanish-language recording to receive a Broadcast Pop Music Award in 1996. Selena had the most successful Latin singles of 1994 with \"Amor Prohibido\". Sales of the song represented Tejano music's first commercial success in Puerto Rico. Many musicians have since recorded the song and released it on their respective albums including Mexican pop singer Thal\u00EDa, glam rock band Moderatto, Finnish singer Meiju Suvas, American entertainer Jennifer Lopez, Mexican pop singer Samo, and Broadway singer Shoshana Bean."@en ;

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Baby,_Please_Don\u0027t_Go>	rdf:type	dbo:MusicalWork ;
	dbo:abstract	"\"Baby, Please Don't Go\" is a blues song which has been called \"one of the most played, arranged, and rearranged pieces in blues history\" by music historian Gerard Herzhaft. It was likely an adaptation of \"Long John\", an old folk theme dating back to slavery in the United States. Delta blues musician Big Joe Williams popularized it with several versions beginning in 1935. The song's roots have been traced back to nineteenth-century American songs which deal with themes of bondage and imprisonment. \"Baby, Please Don't Go\" became an early blues standard with recordings by several blues musicians, such as Papa Charlie McCoy, Leonard \"Baby Doo\" Caston, Lightnin' Hopkins, John Lee Hooker and Big Bill Broonzy. After World War II, Chicago blues and rhythm and blues artists adapted the song to newer music styles. In 1952, a doo-wop version by the Orioles reached the top ten on the race records chart. In 1953, Muddy Waters recorded the song as an electric Chicago-ensemble blues piece, which influenced many subsequent renditions. In the 1960s, \"Baby, Please Don't Go\" became a popular rock song after the Northern Irish group Them recorded it in 1964. Several music writers have identified Jimmy Page, a studio guitarist at the time, as participating in the recording, although his exact contributions are unclear. Subsequently, Them's uptempo rock arrangement has become a rock standard. \"Baby, Please Don't Go\" has been inducted into both the Blues and Rock and Roll Halls of Fame."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"Bonaparte's Retreat\" is a song written by American country music artist Pee Wee King. Various versions of the melody themes exist as traditional fiddle tunes dating back to before the turn of the 20th Century, and probably well before that. The obvious origin of the title was Napoleon Bonaparte's disastrous retreat from Russia in 1812, and some earlier British folk songs told of that event. But the lyrics of King's version are about dancing and romance, not history. King's version was released as a single in 1950 and peaked at number 10 on the Billboard Hot Country Singles chart. Kay Starr recorded the song later in 1950. Her version peaked at number 4 on the Billboard Hot 100. Glen Campbell then covered the song for his 1974 album Houston (I'm Comin' to See You). It was released in July 1974 as the album's second single. Campbell's version peaked at number 3 on the Billboard Hot Country Singles chart. It also reached number 1 on the RPM Country Tracks chart in Canada. Willie Nelson also covered the song as a bonus track on the reissue of his 1975 concept album Red Headed Stranger. In addition, the song was covered by Michael Nesmith and the Second National Band's album Tantamount to Treason Vol. 1."@en ;

It was nominated at various music industry awards, including a Grammy Award nomination for Best Country Duo/Group Performance at the 56th Grammy Awards. Commercially, the single enjoyed a moderate success in the United States, peaking at number 23 on the Hot Country Songs and at number 87 on the Billboard Hot 100. It is Clarkson's fifth country chart entry, and Gill's biggest country hit since \"The Reason Why\" in 2006. The song's first live performance was on the 46th Annual Country Music Association Awards on November 1, 2012. The song's accompanying music video is composed of the live footage from the Country Music Association awards which was directed by Paul Miller."@en ;

The song was written and produced by Arjona along with longtime collaborators Dan Warner and Lee Levin under their stage name Los Gringos, with additional production work from Puerto Rican singer-songwriter Tommy Torres. \"El Amor\" is the first single Arjona releases under his new record label, Metamorfosis. Lyrically, \"El Amor\" was written by Arjona in an attempt to show all sides of love, explaining that \"So many good things about love has been shown, that somebody had to turn it around and tell the bad ones\". The song became Arjona's fourth single to reach number one on the US Billboard Top Latin Songs, and the seventh to do so on the Latin Pop Songs chart. It also became his first song ever to reach number one on the Tropical Songs chart, improving his previous peak of number two almost twelve years prior. \"El Amor\" also topped several national charts from Latin America. An accompanying music video for \"El Amor\" was released in September 2011. It was directed by Ricardo Calder\u00F3n and filmed in black and white. The clip shows Arjona singing while a wedding is being celebrated inside a chapel. \"El Amor\" was performed by Arjona as part of a televised show broadcast by Televisa, which included guest appearances by Gaby Moreno, Ricky Mu\u00F1oz from Mexican band Intocable and Paquita la del Barrio. It was also included on the set list for his ongoing tour, the Metamorfosis World Tour."@en ;

It was written and composed by Heatwave's keyboard player Rod Temperton and produced by Quincy Jones. Patti Austin provides the backing and scat vocals that are heard throughout, and one of Benson's fellow jazz guitarists, Lee Ritenour, also performs on the selection. The song was a commercial success, and was Benson's first single to hit number one on the US Billboard Soul Singles chart. It also peaked at number four on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart, making it his most successful pop entry. It also peaked at number two on the Billboard Hot Disco Singles chart and at number seven in the UK Singles Chart. \"Give Me the Night\" was one of the last disco singles to become a major success, with the steady decline of the genre in the early 1980s."@en ;

Flowers wrote \"Grandad\" with Creation vocalist Kenny Pickett. The single was released in November 1970 and, aided by promotion such as appearing on children's shows such as Basil Brush and DJ Tony Blackburn claiming it as his favourite record, it soon reached the charts. Following an appearance on Top of the Pops, it looked like being the Christmas number one that year, but a strike by power workers affected the EMI pressing plant, causing distribution problems for the single, and so it missed out. However, the following January it reached #1 on the UK singles chart for three weeks, during which time Dunn celebrated his 51st birthday, and went on to spend a total of 27 weeks on the chart. Dunn never had another hit but released an album Permission to Sing Sir!. In 1979-1984, Dunn starred as Charlie 'Grandad' Quick in a children's television show named Grandad, although the series did not use the song as the theme tune."@en ;

dbr:Hold_It_Against_Me	rdf:type	dbo:MusicalWork ;
	dbo:abstract	"\"Hold It Against Me\" is a song performed by American singer Britney Spears for her seventh studio album, Femme Fatale (2011). It was written and produced by Max Martin, Dr. Luke and Billboard, with additional writing by Bonnie McKee. Luke explained that he wanted \"Hold It Against Me\" to sound unlike his previous productions. The song was originally offered to Katy Perry, but Luke and Martin felt that it did not suit her. A demo version of the track by McKee was leaked on January 6, 2011, and the single became available for streaming on January 10, 2011. It was released the following day. Musically, \"Hold It Against Me\" blends pulsating industrial and dance beats with elements of grime. The chorus has lilting synths that lift her vocals and contrast them with the hard beats. The song features a dubstep-influenced breakdown, in which Spears moans and blows kisses, and the song ends with a final chorus with elements of rave. The lyrics portray the singer seducing someone on the dancefloor, and the chorus revolves around pick-up lines. After the song was released, The Bellamy Brothers criticized it for being similar to their 1979 hit \"If I Said You Had a Beautiful Body Would You Hold It Against Me\". They were sued by Martin, Luke, McKee and Billboard for defamation and libel, but the case was dismissed after The Bellamy Brothers apologized. McKee stated in an interview that the title was inspired by a discussion she had with Katy Perry about the latter's body. Most reviewers praised \"Hold It Against Me\", although some criticized its lyrical content. The song debuted at number one in Belgium (Wallonia), Canada, Denmark, Finland and New Zealand, as well as on the US Billboard Hot 100, where it became her fourth chart topper. In the United States, \"Hold It Against Me\" made Spears the second artist in Billboard's history to debut at number one more than once, behind Mariah Carey. \"Hold It Against Me\" was Spears's second consecutive single to debut at number one. The feat also made her the third female artist to score number one singles in three consecutive decades, and the seventh artist overall. In 2012, it was voted the best song to reach the top position on the Hot 100 over the past two years. The single has also charted in the top five in countries such as Australia, Ireland, Italy, Scotland, Finland and Norway. The accompanying music video for the song was directed by Jonas \u00C5kerlund. It premiered on February 17, 2011, following a two-week promotional campaign of teasers. The video features Spears as a pop star who fell from space to find fame on Earth. There, she becomes overwhelmed by the pressures of being a celebrity and breaks down. The video received mixed to positive reviews; critics complimented its artistic concept and visuals, but dismissed the use of product placement. Spears performed \"Hold It Against Me\" at Rain Nightclub, Good Morning America and Jimmy Kimmel Live!. She has also performed it as the opening number of the Femme Fatale Tour (2011)."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"Honey Chile\" is a 1967 single by Motown girl group Martha Reeves and the Vandellas on the Gordy label. This was the first single to bill Martha Reeves by her full name, as opposed to simply \"Martha\" and the Vandellas. Produced by Richard Morris and written by Morris and Sylvia Moy, the tune described how the narrator (Martha Reeves) wanting to get rid of her boyfriend who's been courting and dating other girls behind her back though she is too weak to let him go stating \"I'll walk a country mile to stay with you\". This song, rare for a pop song, actually shows character development: at the end of the first verse she states that she is worthless without him, while in the second to last line she says she will find the strength to leave him. Filled with Southern connotations (inspired by Reeves' birth in rural Alabama), the tune rose to number eleven on the Billboard pop singles chart and number five on the Billboard R&B singles chart. It is notable for several reasons: it is the first track to feature new member, Martha's younger sister Sandra \"Lois\" Reeves replacing just-fired Betty Kelley, it was the group's twelfth top 40 pop single, and it was also the last top 40 hit the group would score throughout the rest of their Motown tenure though they would score several top 40 R&B singles before leaving the label in 1973. It was also the first single to be credited as Martha Reeves and the Vandellas after the label requested that some of the lead singers of several groups put their name in front of the group's to earn billing for both lead singer and group."@en ;

However, despite the self-censorship, a Parental Advisory sticker was still printed on the cover. The song was originally made by Plies, an up-and-coming rapper from Fort Myers, Florida, but his verse was replaced by Snoop's for reasons explained below.[citation needed] Even his name has been left out from the writers' credits.[citation needed] This song was #88 on MTV Asia's list of Top 100 Hits of 2007.

	dbo:abstract	"\"'Ingenting\" is a song by Swedish alternative rock band Kent from their seventh studio album, Tillbaka till samtiden. It was released as the album's lead single on September 17, 2007 through RCA Records and Sony BMG. This is the first new release from Kent as a quartet and the band has chosen to work with a new producer; the Dane Jon \"Joshua\" Schumann. The result is a brand new electro based sound and this first single contains two songs with hard and up tempo beat along with dance and club rhythms. It feels like a step towards the more broad albums like Vapen & Ammunition or Hagnesta Hill compared to the previous more low key and narrow songs on Du & jag d\u00F6den and The Hj\u00E4rta & Sm\u00E4rta EP. References to Hagnesta Hill are made in the lyrics to Ingenting and you can still hear the echoes of the two previous productions on these two single tracks although it's mixed with a new sound in more direct songs. This maxi cd single also contains three remixes of the title track made by Italian DJ duo Alex Dolby and Santos, the Danish DJ duo Copyfokking and a third by Kent's bassist, Martin Sk\u00F6ld, under the pseudonym Shieldster. The single was released September 17 but people that bought Sony Ericsson mobile phones with a special Kent-package after September 10 could download the song already on the 16th. No promo copies was sent out before the release. The single was released in Germany on September 21 through the Sony BMG subsidiary Red Ink/RoughTrade (same pressing as the Nordic release).

	dbo:abstract	"\"Just Can't Get Enough\" is a song by the English electronic music band Depeche Mode. It was released in September 1981 as the third single from their debut album, Speak and Spell (1981). It was recorded during the summer of that year at Blackwing Studios, and was the band's first single to be released in the United States, on 18 February 1982. A riff-driven synthpop song, \"Just Can't Get Enough\" was the final single to be written by founding member Vince Clarke, who left the band in November 1981. The single version of \"Just Can't Get Enough\" is the same version that appears on the UK version of Speak and Spell. The 12\" single featured a \"Schizo Mix\", which is an extended version with additional synth parts adding a sinister feel to the track. This version appears on the US version of Speak and Spell, the UK re-release of Speak and Spell, the re-release of The Singles 81\u219285 and Remixes 81\u201304. In addition, the single's B-side, \"Any Second Now\", was the first commercially available Depeche Mode instrumental. It shows up on the UK rerelease of Speak and Spell. A version including vocals (the first Depeche Mode vocals to be handled by Martin Gore) appeared on the album as \"Any Second Now (Voices)\". There is also an extended version, the \"Altered\" Mix. In the United States, the B-side is \"Tora! Tora! Tora!\". On the album, the song is crossfaded with the previous track, \"Photographic\", but on the single, the introduction is clean. The single reached number 8 on the UK Singles Chart and number 26 on the US Hot Dance Club Play chart, making it their highest-charting single at the time on both counts. It also became the band's first (and biggest) hit in Australia, reaching number 4."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"Just the Way You Are\" is a song by Billy Joel and the third track from his 1977 album The Stranger that became Joel's first US Top 10 (reaching #3) and UK Top 20 single, as well as Joel's first gold single in the US. The song also topped the Billboard Easy Listening Chart for the entire month of January 1978. \"Just the Way You Are\", which won the 1979 Grammy Awards for Record of the Year and Song of the Year, turned Joel's chart career, which had largely stalled out by early 1975, into long-lasting success. The song also coincidentally tied another of his #3 hits, his last US Top 10 single, \"The River of Dreams\", for most weeks on the Hot 100 of any of his singles, at 27."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"Less Than Zero\" is the eighth track on Elvis Costello's debut album My Aim Is True, and the first Costello single that Stiff Records released.The song expressed Costello's anger after seeing former British Union of Fascists leader Oswald Mosley interviewed on television attempting to deny his racist past. In the liner notes to the Rhino edition of the album, Costello writes: The song therefore fits in with a number of others on early Costello albums that deal with themes of fascism and totalitarianism, which also include \"Night Rally\" from This Year's Model and \"Goon Squad\" from Armed Forces. In this case, a racist and totalitarian movement is seen in terms of sub rosa teenage sex: \"Turn up the TV... Even your mother won't detect it/So your father won't know.\" Allmusic critic Mark Deming describes the melody as \"slow, slinky [and] sinister.\" Deming also suggests that the melody shows some reggae influences, even though the rhythm does not incorporate reggae syncopations. Deming describes the song as \"controversial, audacious, and highly effective\" as well as \"a truly remarkable debut.\" On his first visit to the United States, Costello found that American audiences didn\u2019t understand the song, writing in his 2015 autobiography, Unfaithful Music and Disappearing Ink, \"I'm not sure if anyone in Cleveland has ever heard of Oswald Mosley or gave a damn about him when we played \"Less Than Zero\" that night. It was just some rock and roll music with a fashionable-sounding title\". Later, he substantially rewrote the lyrics to refer to Lee Harvey Oswald. This was a reference to the common misconception among American fans that this was the \"Mr. Oswald\" referred to in the original lyrics. This version is usually referred to as the \"Dallas version\" and is available as a bonus track on the My Aim is True reissue, and a live version can be found on Live at the El Mocambo. The song later provided US author Bret Easton Ellis with the title of his debut novel. The song was also involved in Costello's infamous performance on Saturday Night Live on 17 December 1977. Following pressure from his record company to play the song on the show, Costello began to play the song, but he stopped after only a few bars, saying that \"there's no reason to do this song here.\" He then launched into an unannounced performance of \"Radio Radio\", a song he had promised not to play. As a result, he was banned from the show until 1989. In 2015, Costello wrote of having seen the Saturday Night Live appearance as an opportunity equivalent to The Beatles\u2019 first live US television performance on The Ed Sullivan Show, writing, \"[\u2026] Columbia insisted that the second song should be \"Less Than Zero\". The song had already proven to be obscure to many American ears and if this was supposed to be our I Want to Hold Your Hand moment, I thought the song was too low-key\". He had then come up with the plan to switch songs, inspired by a live performance on the BBC's The Lulu Show in 1969 in which Jimi Hendrix had scrapped a performance of Hey Joe after a few bars to instead play an impromptu tribute to Cream, who had broken up just days before\". \"Less Than Zero\" appears on the first Stiff Records compilation; A Bunch of Stiff Records, whilst the B-side, \"Radio Sweetheart\", appears on their second; Hits Greatest Stiffs."@en ;

The song's video was directed by Cat Solen and the track was later commercially released in several formats. It reached #39 on the UK Singles Chart after it was re-issued in May 2007. However, it failed to chart anywhere else in the world, in spite of it being a live fan favourite. The B-side for \"Let's Make Love and Listen to Death from Above\" is the cut \"Acho Um Pouco Bom\" (roughly \"I think it's a bit good\", in Portuguese).

	dbo:abstract	"\"Liza Jane\" was the first recording to be released as a single by David Bowie, and credited to Davie Jones with the King-Bees. This event took place in 1964 when Bowie was 17 years old. The B-side of the single was the Paul Revere and the Raiders song \"Louie, Louie Go Home\". Both songs on the single were recorded in a seven-hour session at Decca Studios in Broadhurst Gardens, West Hampstead. Bowie came in touch with Leslie Conn, who ran Doris Day's music publishing company and was a talent scout for the Dick James Organisation. Conn booked The King Bees for a wedding anniversary party, but with loud RnB on the setlist, Conn stopped the gig after only 10 minutes. Conn still became The King Bees' manager and promoter for some months in 1964, and they recorded and released \"Liza Jane\" as a single for the Decca Records label Vocalion Pop. Despite promoting the single on the television shows Juke Box Jury, Ready Steady Go! and The Beat Room, and receiving good radio coverage, the single sold poorly and the band was subsequently dropped from the label. The song was an arrangement of the old standard \"Li'l Liza Jane\", but Conn was credited as the songwriter, and the usual story is that this was done to get more royalties from the single. Conn recalled in 1997 how the King Bees had come up with a six bar blues, which everyone used. Conn came up with some ideas of his own for the song, they improvised and the song came together. After Conn and Bowie parted in 1964, Conn moved to Majorca for a few years, and was one day on the phone with his mother who wanted to get rid of a few hundred copies of \"Liza Jane\" that were stored in her garage. They agreed to throw them away. Bowie recorded the song again, in 2000, for the album Toy, which was never officially released but eventually leaked on the Internet in 2011."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"Loca\" (English: \"Crazy\") is a song by Colombian singer-songwriter Shakira, taken from her seventh studio album, Sale el Sol (2010). It was released by Epic Records as the lead single from the album. The Spanish-language version features Dominican rapper El Cata, and was released on 10 September 2010, while the English-language version features British rapper Dizzee Rascal, and was released on 13 September 2010. It was written and produced by Shakira, with additional songwriting from Edward Bello, Armando P\u00E9rez, and Dylan Mills. The song is a Latin pop and merengue track that lyrically describes Shakira's eccentric infatuation with a man. In August 2014, a senior US district judge found \"Loca\" to have been indirectly plagiarised from \"Loca con su Tiguere\", a mid-1990s song composed by Dominican songwriter Ramon \"Arias\" Vasquez. The case was later dismissed in August 2015 after it was found that Vasquez had fabricated the evidence he had presented in court earlier. Upon its release, \"Loca\" received generally favourable reviews from music critics, who complimented the inclusion of merengue music on the recording. The English version of the song became a worldwide commercial success and peaked inside the top five of the record charts of countries like Austria, Belgium, France, Hungary and Italy. The Spanish version peaked atop the charts of Spain and Switzerland, and became a hit on the Latin record charts in the United States, topping the Billboard Hot Latin Songs, Latin Pop Airplay, and Tropical Songs charts. \"Loca\" received record certifications in various countries around the world, including a diamond certification in Colombia and multi-platinum certifications in Italy, Mexico, and Spain. Its accompanying music video was filmed in Barcelona, Spain in August 2010, and was released the following month. It features Shakira interacting with a beach crowd, and dancing in front of the sea wearing a golden bikini. It generated a favourable response from critics, many of whom praised its concept for matching the vibe of the song. For additional promotion, Shakira performed \"Loca\" on a number of television shows and on her The Sun Comes Out World Tour."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"Louboutins\" is a song recorded by American entertainer Jennifer Lopez. Written and produced by Terius \"The-Dream\" Nash and C. \"Tricky\" Stewart, the record was recorded by fellow recording artist and label-mate Brandy Norwood, but was given to Lopez following Norwood's departure from Epic Records. Lopez originally released the song as the lead single from her seventh studio album, Love?; however, after Lopez herself moved record labels to Island Records, the new lead single, \"On the Floor\", was released and \"Louboutins\" was not included on the album. The electro-R&B song uses the celebrity footwear brand Louboutins as metaphor for female empowerment, with the lyrics focusing on women who need to leave their bad relationships with their heads held high. Lopez premiered \"Louboutins\" at the American Music Awards on November 22, 2009, where she accidentally fell on her rear-end in the middle of the performance. Ryan Seacrest and will.i.am praised Lopez's showmanship and professionalism for swiftly recovering from the fall to continue the performance. It made its radio premiere a day later on KIIS-FM's On Air With Ryan Seacrest before being sent for radio adds on December 8, 2009. It was then released as a digital download on December 21, 2009 in the United States and Canada.[citation needed] \"Louboutins\" eventually topped the US Hot Dance Club Songs chart but failed to chart on the Billboard Hot 100 as it garnered little airplay. Subsequently in 2010, Lopez announced that her ten-year partnership with Sony Music was over, making the single her last release under Epic Records. A video for the single was never filmed and further promotion of the song was cancelled."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"Pallas Athena\" is a song written by David Bowie in 1993 for the album Black Tie White Noise. The name is taken from the Greek goddess, Athena, who famously depicted in Athenian statues under the form of Pallas Athena. Hence, the name of the song is a suggestion of religion and icons and sets the mood for a dark piece concerning the power that religion has over man. The lyrics are rather sparse, but the phrase beginning the piece, \"God is on top of it, that's all,\" delivered as though from an African-American preacher, is ominous and intimidating, accompanied with the sound of strings delivering a sorrowful melody. The piece develops into a techno dance piece, using string sounds to hold the ominous mood while overlaid atop bass and drums. David Bowie's saxophone playing is amplified into a scream-like sound, which solos, along with Lester Bowie on trumpet. A lyric, \"We are, we are, we are, we are praying,\" is repeated through the close of the song in a somber, monk-like fashion. Ultimately, the song restates Bowie's interest in how man relates with God. Bowie used to play a drum'n'bass version of the song during his 1997 Earthling tour, and a live version recorded at Paradiso, Holland 10 June 1997 was released as a single under the name Tao Jones Index, a very limited edition only available on 12\" vinyl. Bowie played as Tao Jones Index during his performance in a dance tent at Phoenix Festival in 1997. It is a pun based on his birth name, David Jones, and his then recent bond offering to the Dow Jones Index. Tao, a Chinese character pronounced \"dao,\" not only stands for the Chinese equivalent to Bowie's first initial, \"D\", but also has heavy religious implications through its correlation to Taoism, therefore contributing to the religious overtones of \"Pallas Athena.\" The Chinese character \u9053 means \"the way\" (the path, the route). It was announced in March 2010 that a digital download EP would be made available in June 2010."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"Plastic Man\" is a song written by Ray Davies and recorded by The Kinks in 1969. The song is in a similar style to earlier tracks such as \"Dedicated Follower of Fashion\". It was written and recorded specifically as an attempt at a hit single, released only days after being recorded. The previous year had been commercially disastrous for The Kinks. Their two singles had failed to reach the top 10 in the UK and failed to chart at all in the US. The album The Kinks Are the Village Green Preservation Society had also failed to chart in both the UK and US. The plan for a hit backfired when the use of the word 'bum' (in the line \"...plastic legs that reach up to his plastic bum\") meant that the BBC refused to play the song. The single only managed to reach #31 in the UK and the following two Kinks singles failed to chart altogether. The single was not released in the US and, although B-side \"King Kong\" was included on the Kink Kronikles compilation in 1972, \"Plastic Man\" was left off, only being released in the US on The Great Lost Kinks Album in 1973. Both sides of the single (as well as a stereo version of the A-side) are included as bonus tracks on the CD reissue of Arthur (Or the Decline and Fall of the British Empire). In 2004, the B-side appeared on the 3-disc Deluxe Edition of The Kinks Are The Village Green Preservation Society, while in 2011, both the mono and stereo mixes of the A-side appeared on the Deluxe Edition of Arthur. Both sides of the single were the final songs to be recorded with founding bassist Pete Quaife and therefore is the last recorded single with the original Kinks line-up, although many Quaife-era Kinks songs have been released since his departure. Shortly after the release of the single, Quaife quit the group and was replaced with John Dalton, who substituted for Quaife from June-October 1966 when Quaife was injured in a car accident. Quaife stated in 1998 that \"Plastic Man\" was his least favorite song that he recorded with The Kinks."@en ;

Recorded and released in 1987, it was a number-one hit in many countries and is sometimes regarded as a significant milestone in the development of British house music and music sampling. The song derives its title directly from a lyrical sample from \"I Know You Got Soul\", a hit single by 4th & B'way/Island labelmates, Eric B. & Rakim, released only months prior in that same year. The single was the product of an uneasy collaboration between electronica-fusion group Colourbox and alternative rock band A R Kane, two groups signed to the independent label 4AD. The link-up was suggested by label founder Ivo Watts-Russell after the two groups had independently sounded him out about the possibility of releasing a commercially oriented dance record, inspired by the American house music that was starting to make an impact on the UK chart. When the M|A|R|R|S project was first released early in 1987, the popularity of the style of the song had already started to grow."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"Ring the Alarm\" is a song recorded by American singer Beyonc\u00E9 Knowles for her second studio album, B'Day (2006). It was composed by Knowles, Britney Spears, Kasseem \"Swizz Beatz\" Dean and Sean Garrett. Columbia Records released \"Ring the Alarm\" as the second single from B'Day in the United States on October 17, 2006, while \"Irreplaceable\" (2006) was serviced as the album's second international and third US single. The song's development was motivated by Knowles' role in the Broadway musical adaptation Dreamgirls (2006). The cover art of \"Ring the Alarm\" proved controversial because Knowles used alligators during the photography session. People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA), declared that Knowles' posing with a baby alligator was arguably abusive to an animal. \"Ring the Alarm\" is an R&B song with punk rock influences. Its introduction features a blaring siren, which sets an aggressive tone. The song's lyrics revolve a woman who feels threatened, and is unwilling to allow another woman to profit from the protagonist's efforts to improve her lover's life. The lyrics were rumored to be about Barbadian recording artist Rihanna's relationship with Jay-Z; Knowles refuted the allegation in an interview with Seventeen magazine. The song was received with mixed reception for contemporary music critics, who noted that it was different from Knowles' previous work. While some commended her willingness to take risks, others were polarized about her aggressive vocals. \"Ring the Alarm\" was nominated for Best Female R&B Vocal Performance at the 49th Grammy Awards. The single debuted at number 12 on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart, becoming Knowles' highest US debut. It reached number 11 on the chart, becoming her first solo single to peak below the top 10. Its accompanying music video was inspired by the 1992 film Basic Instinct and was directed by Sophie Muller. It was filmed inside a cavernous hangar on the Brooklyn waterfront in New York City. The video garnered generally mixed reviews critics, who universally thought that it was eccentric. Knowles promoted \"Ring the Alarm\" through various live performances on televised shows and awards ceremonies, including the 2006 MTV Video Music Awards. The song was included on her set list on The Beyonc\u00E9 Experience (2007) in Los Angeles and her world tour, I Am... Tour. (2009\u201310)"@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"The Living Tree\" was written by Catherine Feeney and Nikki Lamborn from Never the Bride, who recorded the song for their 2002 album Surprise. It was a Top 40 hit for Shirley Bassey in 2007. Nikki Lamborn and Catherine Feeney personally requested Bassey to record the song; they had left a copy of their recording at her gym in Monaco with a note saying they knew it was a song for her. In 2005 Bassey topped the bill, in her home town of Cardiff, at the Royal Variety Performance and premiered her version of \"The Living Tree\". The song was frequently performed live in 2006 and included in the set of the 2006 UK tour. In early 2007 she made an appearance on the British TV show The Dame Edna Treatment and performed \"The Living Tree\" and a comic duet version of \"Big Spender\" with Dame Edna Everage. The CD single included seven versions of the song and CD-ROM tracks of the video, the first video track is taken from her live performance at the 2006 Faenol Festival in North Wales, features Bassey introducing the song. The video, on track 9, uses animation interwoven with a live performance of the track during this concert. The video was directed by Oliver Moss and produced by Andrew Brassington.The single was released worldwide as a digital download, on 7 May 2007, on the iTunes Stores.The single peaked at #37 on the UK Singles Chart, making a record for Miss Bassey of being the only artist to be active in the UK singles charts for more than 50 years. The song was released on the 2007 studio album Get the Party Started."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"The Show Must Go On\" is a song by the British rock band Queen, featured as the twelfth and final track on their 1991 album Innuendo. It is credited to Queen, but written mainly by Brian May. The song chronicles the effort of Freddie Mercury continuing to perform despite approaching the end of his life; he was dying from complications due to HIV/AIDS, although his illness had not yet been made public in spite of ongoing media speculation claiming that he was seriously ill. Mercury was so ill when the band recorded the song in 1990, that May had concerns as to whether he was physically capable of singing it. Recalling Mercury's performance, May states; \"I said, 'Fred, I don't know if this is going to be possible to sing.' And he went, 'I'll fucking do it, darling' \u2014 vodka down \u2014 and went in and killed it, completely lacerated that vocal.\" It was released as a single in the United Kingdom on 14 October 1991 in promotion for the Greatest Hits II album, just six weeks before Mercury died. Following Mercury's death on 24 November 1991, the song re-entered the British charts and spent as many weeks in the top 75 (five) as it did upon its original release, initially reaching a peak of 16. A live version with Elton John on vocals appeared on Queen's Greatest Hits III album. The song was first played live on 20 April 1992, during The Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert, performed by the three remaining members of Queen, with Elton John singing lead vocals and Black Sabbath guitarist Tony Iommi playing rhythm guitar. It has since been played live by Queen + Paul Rodgers with Rodgers citing one of the performances as the best of his career. Since its release, the song has appeared on television, film, and has been covered by a number of artists."@en ;

It was released on April 5, 1996 through Columbia Records, as the sixth and final single from the album, and as a B-side to \"Forever\" in Australia. The R&B-influenced song, which has been considered by Carey as one of her personal favorites, features a soft melody and retro-style melody, and had music critics drawing comparisons to earlier works from one of her vocal inspirations, Minnie Riperton. \"Underneath the Stars\" received a limited number of pressings in the United States, and failed to chart on the US Billboard Hot 100. However, the song did manage to chart at number sixty-nine on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs airplay component chart. Critically, it was considered one of the best songs on Daydream by music reviewers. A music video was shot for \"Underneath the Stars\" in Europe, but the video remains unreleased. The song was performed throughout the Daydream World Tour and the performance at the Tokyo Dome was later included on a rare DVD titled \"Mariah Carey Live In Japan.\""@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"Ain't It Fun\" is a song by American rock band Paramore, released as the fourth single from their self-titled fourth studio album Paramore (2013). Produced by musician Justin Meldal-Johnsen, the song was recorded in Los Angeles. Development for it began with a keyboard loop recorded by its guitarist, Taylor York. Instruments including xylophone and bass guitar were later brought, along with a six-member gospel choir. York and the band's vocalist, Hayley Williams, wrote the song based on her experience of relocating and the latter's subsequent attitude. The song received critical acclaim from music critics, who hailed its musical diversity. It was serviced to mainstream radio in the United States and Italy; a 12-inch vinyl of the single was released for Record Store Day 2014. The song became Paramore's highest peaking single on the US Billboard Hot 100, peaking at number 10 and received 'double platinum' certification from the RIAA having sold over two million singles. Internationally, the song garnered moderate commercial outcomes, reaching the top 40 of Australian, Canadian and Venezuelan charts. On February 8, 2015, the song won the Grammy Award for Best Rock Song at the 57th ceremony, becoming Paramore's first Grammy win, and making Williams the first woman to score that honor since Alanis Morissette in 1999. \"Ain't It Fun\" was performed on television several times, including on The Voice, Late Night with Seth Meyers and American Idol. It was also included in the band's The Self-Titled Tour (2013\u201315). After the original music video directed by Jonathan Desbiens was cancelled, a second visual was directed by Sophia Peer. The latter, released in January 2014, documents the band attempting to break a series of world records."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"Beg for It\" is a song by Australian rapper Iggy Azalea, featuring Danish singer M\u00D8. It was written by Azalea, Charli XCX, The Invisible Men and Kurtis McKenzie and Jon Turner of The Arcade, and produced by the latter two. The song was released on 24 October 2014 as the lead single from the reissue of Azalea's debut studio album The New Classic (2014), titled Reclassified (2014). An initial live preview of the song in September 2014 resulted in widespread media speculation that it featured XCX as the sequel to \"Fancy\", XCX's previous collaboration with Azalea. However, it was later revealed that XCX wrote the track's hook for M\u00D8, who Azalea discovered on YouTube. A pop-rap and electro-trap song, \"Beg for It\" contains a percolating, booming stark beat and solicits a sinuous, minimalist feel. Its lyrical content comprises themes of girl power and prominently figures the phrase \"pussy power\". The song garnered generally favourable reviews from music critics, many of whom commended its catchiness. Others were, however, ambivalent towards its similarities with Azalea's previous singles \"Black Widow\" and \"Fancy\". \"Beg for It\" became a top 30 hit on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 and in Australia, where it peaked at number 27 and number 29 respectively. It was more successful on the U.S. Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart where it peaked at number eight for five consecutive weeks and became Azalea's fourth top 10 hit of 2014. In May 2015, \"Beg for It\" was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). An accompanying music video for the song, directed by David LaChapelle, was cancelled due to scheduling conflicts and Azalea's conflicting tour schedule. Instead, an accompanying lyric video for the song was released on Azalea's Vevo page. Their first live performance of the song on Saturday Night Live was panned by many critics, who commented extensively on M\u00D8's vocal latency and poor performance timing, with one deeming it \"one of the most cringe-worthy live moments in recent history\". M\u00D8 uploaded a handwritten apology in response to the criticism, in which she explained that she experienced technical difficulties with her microphone. The singer was absent from all of Azalea's subsequent live performances of \"Beg for It\" on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon, the 41st People's Choice Awards and the 2014 American Music Awards."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"Burning Up\" is a song written and recorded by American singer Madonna from her eponymous debut studio album Madonna (1983). It was released as the album's second single on March 9, 1983, in some countries as a double-A side single with \"Physical Attraction\". The song was presented as an early recorded demo by Madonna to Sire Records who green-lighted the recording of the single after the first single \"Everybody\" became a dance hit. Madonna collaborated with Reggie Lucas, who produced the single while John Benitez provided the guitar riffs and backing vocals. Musically, the song incorporates instrumentation from bass guitar, synthesizers and drums, and the lyrics talk of the singer's lack of shame in declaring her passion for her lover. Released with \"Physical Attraction\" on the B side, the song was given mixed reviews from contemporary critics and authors, who noted the song's darker, urgent composition while praising its dance beats. The single failed to do well commercially anywhere, except the dance chart in the United States, where it peaked at three, and the Australian charts, where it was a top 20 hit. After a number of live appearances in clubs to promote the single, it was added to the set-list of the 1985 Virgin Tour. An electric guitar version was performed on the 2004 Re-Invention World Tour and the 2015\u201316 Rebel Heart Tour. The accompanying music video of the song portrayed Madonna in the classic submissive female positions, while writhing in passion on an empty road, for her lover who appeared to come from her behind on a car. The video ended showing Madonna driving the car instead, thereby concluding that she was always in charge. Many authors noted that the \"Burning Up\" music video was a beginning of Madonna's depiction of her taking control of a destabilized male sexuality."@en ;

It was released on 13 September 1997 as a tribute single to the late Diana, Princess of Wales, with the global proceeds from the song going towards Diana's charities. In many countries, it was pressed as a double A-side with \"Something About the Way You Look Tonight\". It was produced by Sir George Martin. According to the Recording Industry Association of America, with certified sales, it is \"the best-selling single of all time.\" The Guinness World Records 2009 states that the song is \"the biggest-selling single since UK and US singles charts began in the 1950s, having accumulated worldwide sales of 33 million copies\". After being released, \"Candle in the Wind 1997\" entered at number one in the UK Singles Chart, John's fourth UK number one single, and became the best-selling single in UK Chart history. In October it became John's ninth U.S. number one single, where it topped the Billboard Hot 100 for 14 weeks, and is the best-selling single in Billboard history, and was the first single certified Diamond in the U.S. The song topped the German Singles Chart for seven weeks, the Australian ARIA Charts for six weeks, reached number one in Japan, Canada, France and music charts around the world. The 1997 version won John the Grammy Award for Best Male Pop Vocal Performance at the 40th Grammy Awards ceremony in 1998. At the 1998 Brit Awards the song was nominated for the Brit Award for Best British Single. The lyrics of the earlier version of \"Candle in the Wind\", written by Bernie Taupin, were a tribute to Marilyn Monroe. The opening lines of the 1973 version, \"Goodbye Norma Jeane, though I never knew you at all,\" were adapted to \"Goodbye England's rose, may you ever grow in our hearts.\" Most of the lyrics were adapted to suit the circumstances of Diana's life and death, but a notable omission was the line, \"Even when you died, the press still hounded you.\" which was replaced with the lyric, \"Even though we try, the truth brings us to tears.\""@en ;

It was written by Simon Cowell, David Kreuger, Per Magnusson, Richard Page, and produced by Steve Mac. The song was digitally released as Lewis's third single on 9 March 2008 in the United Kingdom. Sony BMG and Syco Music launched it as a double A-side with \"Better in Time\", and \"You Bring Me Down\" as the B-side. It is a R&B and pop song composed with a tempo of sixty beats per minute. It was written in a period of one day at Page's home in Malibu, California, with Cowell giving the idea to base it on the Christian poem \"Footprints\". The single's music video was filmed by British director Sophie Muller in Johannesburg, South Africa. The video describes social problems within the city, but ends with a message of hope. \"Footprints in the Sand\" became the official theme of the 2008 version of biennial charity programme Sport Relief, by BBC. The song received positive reviews from music critics, some of them noting its gospel sounds and Lewis's vocals being compared to American R&B singer Mariah Carey. \"Footprints in the Sand\" charted as a separate single in Ireland, the United Kingdom and the European Hot 100 Singles, whilst the double A-side appeared in Germany and Switzerland, and was certified silver in the UK by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI), in 2008. In the same year, Lewis performed the song for the first time in the UK live on the television programme Dancing on Ice. In 2009, the song was covered by Lucie Jones, a contestant of The X Factor, and by Julia Star from Swiss programme Die gr\u00F6ssten Schweizer Talente."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"Grace Kelly\" is a song by the British singer Mika, released for download on 9 January 2007. It also appears on Mika's 2007 album Life in Cartoon Motion. Produced and mixed by Greg Wells, the song entered the UK Singles Chart at number three and the UK Official Download Chart at number one. One week later, it jumped to the top of the UK Singles Chart. The track was number one on the UK Singles Chart for five weeks, and ended 2007 as the year's third biggest-selling single in that country. In the U.S., \"Grace Kelly\" was made available for digital download on 16 January 2007. This song was also #89 on MTV Asia's list of Top 100 Hits of 2007. It was designed to be a mocking satire of musicians who try to reinvent themselves to be popular. The song is titled after Academy Award-winning American film and stage actress, and Princess of Monaco, Grace Kelly. The bit of dialogue used in the song is from the film The Country Girl. Mika claims the song was inspired after a bad experience with a record company executive, in which he was told to be more like Craig David. The lyric \"So I try a little Freddie\" is a reference to Queen's Freddie Mercury, to whose singing voice Mika's has been compared. On at least one occasion, Mika confirmed that he used the main melody from Figaro's famous aria Largo al factotum in the opera The Barber of Seville by Gioachino Rossini. Mika performed the song at the MTV Europe Music Awards 2007 in Munich, and at the 2008 BRIT Awards at the Earls Court Exhibition Centre, London where it was nominated for Best British Single. The song has sold 604,000 copies in the UK as stated by the Official Charts Company."@en ;

For the re-release of \"Gravity's Rainbow\", the band reshot the music video. There are two videos for this track, the original was shot in a basement using props belonging to the band members and took in total 72 hours to complete. During the babies scene in the original video, an album cover from Frankie Valli and his band the Four Seasons is shown; Klaxons later covered their track \"The Night\" as a B-side of their single \"It's Not Over Yet\". The new version of \"Gravity's Rainbow\" was made to accompany the release of the new recording of the single and includes scenes reminiscent of those in the original. This version is also one of only two Klaxons videos that feature their drummer Steffan Halperin.

Critics noted the track as one of the better songs from Last Train to Paris, particularly for Danja's production, but criticized the lyrics for being superficial and for lacking substance. \"Hello Good Morning\" was promoted with several live television performances including on season nine of American Idol and Friday Night with Jonathan Ross, amongst others. An accompanying music video, filmed by Hype Williams, features Diddy\u2013Dirty Money parting in Los Angeles, with T.I. enjoying the company of two ladies in an apartment and Diddy driving through the city at night. It was inspired by the 1995 film Heat. An edited version of the clip was made for the official remix, and a completely new street party-themed video was filmed for the grime remix. At the time of release, \"Hello Good Morning\" became the album and group's first single to chart on the Billboard Hot 100, reaching No. 27.

The song was mostly panned by music critics, who criticized its sound and called it immature, while a few named it unique and playful. Lavigne shot a music video for the track in Japan and was released on 21 April 2014. It was met with negative reviews by critics, with Billboard labeling it \"abhorrent\" and \"lazy\". The video's depiction of Japanese culture was accused of being racist and offensive by some.

dbr:Hung_Up	rdf:type	dbo:MusicalWork ;
	dbo:abstract	"\"Hung Up\" is a song by American singer Madonna from her tenth studio album Confessions on a Dance Floor (2005). It was written and produced by Madonna in collaboration with Stuart Price, and released as the lead single from the album. Initially used in a number of television advertisements and serials, the song was released as the album's lead single on October 17, 2005. It has also made an appearance on her 2009 greatest hits album, Celebration. It also became Madonna's first track to be released to the iTunes Store for digital download. \"Hung Up\" prominently features a sample from the instrumental introduction to ABBA's hit single \"Gimme! Gimme! Gimme! (A Man After Midnight)\", for which Madonna personally bought permission from ABBA's songwriters Benny Andersson and Bj\u00F6rn Ulvaeus. Musically the song is influenced by 1980s pop, with a chugging groove and chorus and a background element of a ticking clock that suggests the fear of wasting time. Lyrically the song is written as a traditional dance number about a strong, independent woman who has relationship troubles. \"Hung Up\" received critical praise from reviewers, who believed that the track would restore the singer's popularity, which had diminished following the release of her 2003 album American Life. Critics suggested it was her best dance track to date and have compared it favorably to other Madonna tracks in the same genre. They also complimented the effective synchronization of the ABBA sample with the actual song. \"Hung Up\" became a worldwide commercial success, peaking atop the charts of 41 countries and earning a place in the Guinness Book of World Records. It was Madonna's 36th top 10 single on the Billboard Hot 100, tying her with Elvis Presley as the artist with most top ten hits. It also became the most successful dance song of the decade in the United States. \"Hung Up\" remains one of the best-selling singles of all time, with sales of over nine million copies worldwide. The music video is a tribute to John Travolta, his movies and to dancing in general. Directed by Johan Renck, the clip starts with Madonna clad in a pink leotard dancing alone in a ballet studio and concludes at a gaming parlor where she dances with her backup troupe. Interspersed are scenes of people displaying their dancing skills in a variety of settings, including a Los Angeles residential neighborhood, a small restaurant and the London Underground. It also features the physical discipline Parkour. Madonna has performed the song in a number of live appearances, including as the finale number in 2006's Confessions Tour, a heavy metal-inspired arrangement in the 2008 Sticky & Sweet Tour and during the 2012 MDNA Tour where the singer performed the song while slacklining."@en ;

The song was written by Haim Saban, Shuki Levy, Steve Durham, Skee-Lo, Tim James and Josh Stevens and produced by the Groove Brothers. The song had two versions, the Disney version, which incorporated words/names like \"Go Go Gadget\" and \"Claw\" and the album version, which has no reference to Inspector Gadget. The group had to record another version of the song, the \"Disney\" version because their album version had suggestive lyrics like \"I can freak you with my gadget\", \"I knew the moment that we met I had to be inside of you, someone you won't forget. So don't say that you don't feel it too. I've opened up my heart and so the rest is up to you\" and \"No sweat, 'cause help is on the way, Don't worry 'cause I'm watching you, No need be afraid\" whereas the Disney version says \"I just call out Go Go Gadget\", \"I knee the moment that we met I had to be a part of you, someone you won't forget. So don't say I'm like to other few. No matter what is coming down, you'll find me next to you.\" and \"No sweat, when Claw is on his way, Don't worry 'bout him catching you, Don't even be afraid\". The Disney version can be heard in the movie Inspector Gadget and the album version can be heard on Youngstown's debut album Let's Roll.

Peaking at #34 on the Billboard Hot 100 (and #11 on the R&B charts), the single returned the group to the top forty after a year recording songs that performed below the top forty. This was among the first A-side singles that longtime Marvelettes member Wanda Young sung lead on. Before 1965, the majority of the leads in Marvelettes songs had belonged to original member Gladys Horton. The single features a woman determined to win the love of an unknowingly conquest telling him that she'll convince him to love her \"until my will to resist is gone\". Her Marvelettes band mates Gladys Horton and Katherine Anderson egg her on with her ad-libbing \"oh yeah/sho' nuff\" in the bridge leading up to the chorus. The single was covered by British mod-pop act, The Action in 1966, released as \"I'll Keep On Holding On\".

	dbo:abstract	"\"I'll Remember\" is a song by American singer Madonna. It was released on March 8, 1994, by Warner Bros. Records as the soundtrack single of the film With Honors. It was a radical change in image and style for Madonna, who had received some negative critical and commercial feedback over the prior two years due to the release of her book Sex, the studio album Erotica and the film Body of Evidence. Warner Bros. had Madonna sing the song after noting most of her previous soundtrack singles had achieved commercial success. It utilizes a synthesized keyboard arrangement to bring about a continuously reverberating heartbeat sound. Madonna's voice is supported by backing vocals. Contemporary critics praised the song, hailing it as one of her best works. It was nominated for Best Song Written Specifically for a Motion Picture or for Television at the 37th Grammy Awards and Best Original Song at the 52nd Golden Globe Awards. \"I'll Remember\" was also a commercial success, peaking at number two on the Billboard Hot 100 and becoming her fourth number-one hit on the Adult Contemporary chart. It also topped the singles charts in Canada and Italy. The accompanying music video portrayed Madonna singing the song in a stylized recording studio. Her look and style was compared to the imagery of the music video of previous single \"Rain\". The androgynous portrayal of Madonna smoking in the last shot, was appreciated critically for breaking gender barriers."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"I Bet\" is a song by American singer Ciara from her sixth studio album, Jackie (2015). Released as the lead single from the album by Epic Records on January 26, 2015, \"I Bet\" serves as Ciara's first single following the birth of her first child and widely publicized break-up with American rapper Future. The song was written by the singer, Harmony \"H-Money\" Samuels and Timothy and Theron Thomas of the production duo Rock City. It was produced by Samuels, and Chris \"TEK\" O'Ryan was responsible for its vocal production. Developed as a \"raw\" and emotional track originating from a personal place in Ciara's life, \"I Bet\" was intended to resonate as \"much bigger than any one person's experience\". A slow-tempo, somber R&B ballad\u2014with sparse, throwback 1990s-style R&B production\u2014\"I Bet\" shifts from the sound of the singer's later discography to recall her earlier works, \"And I\" (2005) and \"Promise\" (2006). The track's lyrical content deal with subjects of betrayal, trust issues and infidelity in a romantic relationship. \"I Bet\" garnered favorable reviews from music critics who deemed it a strong comeback for the singer, and commended her vocal range, as well its rare and honest showcase of her private life. Described as a realest, scathing breakup song, a variety of publications opined that the ballad was written about Ciara's break-up with Future as a diss track, and noted that it was the first time the singer weighed in on their split. Upon its release the song debuted at number 96 on the US Billboard Hot 100 and peaked at number 43. Three official remixes have been released - one featuring T.I., another featuring Joe Jonas and a progressive house remix by Dutch DJ R3hab with additional vocals added for R3hab's remix."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"I Care\" is a song recorded by the American singer Beyonc\u00E9 for her fourth studio album, 4 (2011). It was written by Jeff Bhasker, Chad Hugo and Beyonc\u00E9 and produced by Bhasker and co-produced by Beyonc\u00E9. The song was recorded at the MSR Studios and was mixed by Jordan Young aka DJ Swivel at KMA Studio in New York City. \"I Care\" is an R&B power ballad, which also contains elements of soul music and rock music. Built on a hand-clapped rhythm and pulsating beats, the song's instrumentation consists of screeching guitars, low-profile synthesizers, pounding drums, heavy percussion instrument and a piano. In \"I Care\", Beyonc\u00E9 admits her vulnerability to her indifferent love interest with both honesty and power. She sings with heartfelt emotion over cooing background vocals and scats alongside a multi-octave guitar solo towards the end of the song. \"I Care\" was sent to contemporary hit radio in Italy on March 23, 2012 as the sixth overall single from 4. \"I Care\" was acclaimed by contemporary music critics who highlighted the heartfelt emotion, sadness and resentment with which Beyonc\u00E9 sings. Critics also complimented the way she made effective use out the power in her lower register in the first and second verses until her voice slowly builds until the commanding chorus is reached. They generally praised the guitar solo and the vocal power of Beyonc\u00E9 which was displayed by \"I Care\" among other songs on 4. Following the release of 4 in early July 2011, \"I Care\" charted number 35 on the South Korea Gaon International Singles Chart, based on downloads alone. The song was part of Beyonc\u00E9's set list for her revues 4 Intimate Nights with Beyonc\u00E9 (2011) and Revel Presents: Beyonc\u00E9 Live (2012) as well as The Mrs. Carter Show World Tour (2013)."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"I Wanna Dance with Somebody (Who Loves Me)\" is the first single from Whitney Houston's second studio album Whitney. It was produced by Narada Michael Walden, and written by George Merrill and Shannon Rubicam of the band Boy Meets Girl, who had previously written the number-one Whitney Houston hit \"How Will I Know.\" The original arrangement was more of a country tune, but was transformed by Walden to make it a dance song. The song received mixed reviews from critics, who compared the musical arrangement to her own \"How Will I Know\" and Cyndi Lauper's \"Girls Just Want to Have Fun.\" The song won the Grammy Award for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance at the 30th Grammy Awards. The single was a commercial success, topping the charts in 13 countries including Australia, Italy, Germany and the UK. In the US, it became her fourth consecutive number one single and sold over one million copies, making it her biggest hit in that country at the time. It was eventually surpassed by her version of \"I Will Always Love You.\""@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"I Want to Break Free\" (About this sound sample ) is a song by British rock band Queen, from their eleventh studio album The Works (1984). Written by bassist John Deacon, it was distributed as a single on 7-inch and 12-inch vinyl records and 3-inch and 5-inch CDs. The song had three versions: album, single and extended, differing in length by more than a factor of 2. It came to be included in most live concerts by the group, in several videos, and in The Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert where it was sung by Lisa Stansfield. The song is largely known for its music video for which all the band members dressed in women's clothes, a concept proposed by Roger Taylor, which parodied the long-running ITV soap opera Coronation Street. The second part of the video included a composition rehearsed and performed with the Royal Ballet and choreographed by Wayne Eagling. Whereas the parody was acclaimed in the United Kingdom, it was considered controversial in the United States and banned by MTV and other stations. After its release in 1984 the single of the song was well received all over Europe and South America, where it was listed within top ten and regarded as an anthem of fight against oppression. The single reached only the 45th position in the US charts, but reached number 3 in the UK and was certified silver with 200,000+ copies sold."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"It's Alright, It's OK\" is a song by Ashley Tisdale from her second studio album, Guilty Pleasure. The song was written by Niclas Molinder, Joacim Persson, and David Jassy, while Molinder and Persson also produced the track. It was released as the album's lead single in the United States and Canada on April 14, 2009, being released in other countries in the following week. A CD single was released in numerous countries, including the United States, Canada, Germany, and the United Kingdom. The track saw Tisdale transition to a more pop rock sound, as opposed to the dance-pop sound found on her last album, Headstrong. Lyrically, the song's theme of heartache and a bad relationship are similar to her previous works, as well as several other tracks featured on Tisdale's second album. The single received positive critical feedback, as was the change in musical direction. The song became Tisdale's fourth single to chart on the Billboard Hot 100, where it peaked at number 99. It became her first Top 20 hit on the Hot Dance Club Play chart, peaking at number 19, her highest peak to date on the chart. The song fared better in other territories, entering the Top 40 in both Sweden and on the Eurochart Hot 100 Singles. \"It's Alright, It's OK\" was Tisdale's first top five hit in Austria, and is her highest peaking single to date in the country. The song was Tisdale's third to enter the Top 20 in Germany, and is her highest peaking single in that country as well. The song's music video features Tisdale finding out that her boyfriend is cheating on her, so she decides to hook up with various men and take pictures with them. She later trashes her ex-boyfriend's house and lets him find the pictures. Various shots of Tisdale and her band performing the song at a party are also shown. Tisdale promoted the single mainly through live performances, most of which were televised. The song was performed on American talk shows such as Good Morning America and The Today Show, while Tisdale also promoted the song with live performances at international show's including Wetten, dass..? and at Los Premios MTV Latinoam\u00E9rica 2009. DJ Cansis recorded a dance cover version of the song, under the title \"OK Alright\". The cover version was released in Europe in 2010, and was later featured on the Love2Club compilation album in the country. The track is the theme song of the German television show \"Die Schulermittler\"."@en ;

Written by lead singer and pianist Freddie Mercury, it was featured on their third album Sheer Heart Attack and later appeared on the band's first compilation album, Greatest Hits. The song is about a high-class call girl. It has been characterised as \"Mercury\u2019s piano-led paean to a Mo\u00EBt-quaffing courtesan\". It has also been described by AllMusic as the true beginning of Queen's \"radio sound\" and \"recalls the cabaret songs of yesteryear, but also shows how Queen was fast becoming a master of power pop\". Rock historian Paul Fowles has written that \"Killer Queen\", with its \"sleazy Parisian imagery\", allowed \"free rein\" to Mercury's \"unique brand of rock theater\". The song won Mercury his first Ivor Novello Award."@en ;

The lead singer and guitarist in Tin Tin, Stephen Duffy, later re-recorded the song twice and released it as a solo single using the name of Stephen \"Tin Tin\" Duffy. The first re-recording was released as a single only in the West Midlands region in 1984. Another version was recorded in late 1984 and released as a single on 25 February 1985. This version made its debut at number 22 in the UK singles chart and peaked at number 4 in March, selling more than 250,000 copies within three weeks and thus being certified silver. The chorus is based on a passage from the book Song of Songs. It was the last song to be played on BBC Radio 1s MW frequency in 1994, before the station became FM only.

	dbo:abstract	"\"Live While We're Young\" is a song by English-Irish boy band One Direction, released as the lead single from their second studio album, Take Me Home (2012). Written by Savan Kotecha and its producers, Rami Yacoub and Carl Falk, the number was released by Syco Records on 28 September 2012. Falk, Kotecha, and Yacoub had collaboratively helmed One Direction's previous hits, \"What Makes You Beautiful\" and \"One Thing\". The track is an uptempo, upbeat bubblegum pop song which features rock undertones, vocal harmonies, hand claps, prominent electric guitar riffs, and repetitive synthesizers. The chorus of the song is predominantly featured alongside the bridge, and is backed by wordless chants. Its opening guitar riff bears similarities with The Clash's 1982 single, \"Should I Stay or Should I Go\". The track received mostly positive reviews from critics, who centred on its omnipresence and jubilant nature. The only negative feedback the song got was centered on the lyrics, which were interpreted as a thinly veiled euphemism for sexual intercourse. A commercial success, the song became a top ten hit in fifteen countries, while reaching the top of the charts in New Zealand and Ireland. In the United States, \"Live While We're Young\" debuted at number three on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, marking the second-highest bow among all UK acts, outpaced only by Elton John's number one arrival with \"Candle in the Wind 1997\". Following an unauthorized internet leak, the accompanying music video was officially released on 20 September 2012, four days earlier than the intended release date. Directed by Vaughan Arnell, the clip, which has a camping festival theme, was generally well received by critics, who commended its carefree nature. Upon release, it broke the Vevo record for having the most views in a 24-hour period with 8.24 million, besting the previous record which had been set by Justin Bieber's \"Boyfriend\" (8.00 million). Bieber subsequently regained the record with his music video for \"Beauty and a Beat\" (10.6 million). One Direction performed \"Live While We're Young\" on televised programs and during their 2 major concert tours: Take Me Home Tour (2013) and Where We Are Tour (2014). The track was featured in a Pepsi television commercial for the United States and was performed on an episode of Glee. This song is the first track on Now 45."@en ;

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Living_Dead_Girl_(song)>	rdf:type	dbo:MusicalWork ;
	dbo:abstract	"\"Living Dead Girl\" is the second single from Rob Zombie's solo debut Hellbilly Deluxe. It was named after Jean Rollin's 1982 film. The line, \"Who is this irresistible creature who has an insatiable love for the dead?\" in the beginning of the song is from the trailer of the film, Lady Frankenstein. The music in the beginning of the song is taken from the trailer of the Wes Craven film, The Last House on the Left. The spoken words \"What are you thinking about?/The same thing you are\" at the beginning of the verses are taken from the 1971 film Daughters of Darkness (a dialogue between the characters played by Delphine Seyrig and Andrea Rau). In this song, Zombie sings, \"Goldfoot's machine creates another fiend so beautiful they make you kill\". This relates to the villain played by Vincent Price in the 1965 film Dr. Goldfoot and the Bikini Machine and the 1966 film Dr. Goldfoot and the Girl Bombs. Also, he sings \"Operation Filth they love to love the wealth of an SS whore making scary sounds.\" This is possibly a reference to the notorious 1974 film Ilsa: She-Wolf of the SS. The song also appears on Rob Zombie's Past, Present & Future, the greatest hits album The Best of Rob Zombie, and a remix is contained on American Made Music to Strip By. The original mix was featured in both Bride of Chucky and Gus Van Sant's Psycho remake, appearing on the album of the latter, the \"Naked Exorcism Remix\" appeared on the The Crow: Salvation Soundtrack in 2000. The song was covered by Sinus Giddy for The Electro-Industrial Tribute to Rob Zombie in 2002. Also a version of the song is played in a club in the TV show Angel, while the character Faith tears apart a dance club. The sleeve for the CD single features an image of Rob Zombie's wife, Sheri Moon. A trance remix of the song also featured on the English trailer for the film Day Watch in late 2007."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"Living for Love\" is a song recorded by American singer Madonna for her thirteenth studio album, Rebel Heart (2015). It was written and produced by Madonna, Diplo and Ariel Rechtshaid, with additional writing from MoZella and Toby Gad. Originally intended for a Valentine's Day 2015 release, the song was rush-released as the lead single from the album on December 20, 2014, by Interscope Records, after demos recorded for the album leaked on to the internet. An EDM and house track on which Madonna experimented with different musical genres, \"Living for Love\" contains instrumentation from percussion and piano by singer Alicia Keys, along with a gospel choir. Madonna composed the track as a break-up song, however she wanted to deviate and make the lyrics as uplifting in nature, talking about counteracting negative thoughts with positive responses. \"Living for Love\" received positive reviews from critics, who praised its rhythm and lyrics, comparing it to her earlier works. They also considered the song a step-up from her last two lead singles. In the United States, it failed to enter the Billboard Hot 100, but became Madonna's 44th number-one hit on the Dance Club Songs chart, tying her with country singer George Strait as the act with most number-one singles on any Billboard chart. Although United Kingdom's BBC Radio 1 decided not to play it, the song entered the UK Singles Chart at number 26, becoming Madonna's 71st top-forty single, extending her record as the female artist with the most top-forty UK singles. \"Living for Love\" reached the top-twenty of the charts in Croatia, Finland, Hungary, Israel, Japan and Lebanon, but was commercially unsuccessful in other nations. An accompanying music video was directed by the French duo Julien Choquart and Camille Hirigoyen, together known as J.A.C.K., and was released in February 2015. The storyline incorporates mythological elements and shows Madonna as a matador, fighting her dancers dressed like minotaurs in a red circular stage. It had numerous costume changes, and was critically appreciated for its empowering theme and transcending gender roles. Madonna first performed the song in a similar matador theme at the 57th Annual Grammy Awards; it became the most-watched moment of the night. The second performance was at the 2015 Brit Awards, which made headlines due to the singer's wardrobe malfunction causing her to be pulled down a flight of stairs that made up part of the stage. Alternate versions of \"Living for Love\" were performed on Le Grand Journal, The Ellen DeGeneres Show and on Madonna's 2015\u201316 Rebel Heart Tour."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"Love Me like You Do\" is a song recorded by English singer and songwriter Ellie Goulding for the soundtrack to the film Fifty Shades of Grey (2015). The song was written by Savan Kotecha, Ilya Salmanzadeh, Tove Lo, Max Martin and Ali Payami; the latter two also produced it. Initially, Kotecha thought about giving the song to American singer Demi Lovato. However, after he and Max Martin were commissioned to write a song for the film, they thought that \"Love Me like You Do\" suited the film and Goulding was selected to sing the track. It was released on 7 January 2015 as the second single from the soundtrack. The song was also included on Goulding's third studio album, Delirium (2015). \"Love Me like You Do\" is a mid-tempo electropop power ballad, with instrumentation consisting in massive synths and crushing drums. Lyrically, similar to the film's theme, the song talks about the uncontrollable feeling of falling in love and being seduced by someone whose touch leaves her begging for more, even when it hurts. It received generally positive reviews from music critics, who praised Goulding's soft vocals and the song for being sultry and grandiose. The song earned Goulding her first Grammy Award nomination for Best Pop Solo Performance, while the songwriters were nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Song Written for Visual Media, the Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song, and the Broadcast Film Critics Association Award for Best Song. \"Love Me like You Do\" was a global success, becoming Goulding's most successful single as well as becoming her first number-one in various countries, topping the charts of over 25 territories, including Australia, Austria, Germany, Ireland, Netherland and Switzerland. In the United Kingdom, it spent four weeks at number one on the UK Singles Chart, while holding the record for the most-streamed track in a single week in the United Kingdom at the time. In the United States, it peaked at number three on the US Billboard Hot 100 and was her first number-one on the Adult Top 40 and second on the Mainstream Top 40. Its accompanying music video, which features scenes of the film and Goulding dancing with her partner in a ballroom, became the twenty-first video to receive 1 billion views on YouTube and received a nomination at the 2015 MTV Video Music Awards for Best Female Video."@en .

It won the Norwegian final by a landslide, beating the second place with almost twice as many votes. In Norway, there was much discussion about Solli-Tangen's English pronunciation of the word \"heart\", as it could sound like he sang hard, resulting in the line \"my hard is yours\". At the Eurovision final, Norway came 20th out of 25, with 35 points. 'My Heart Is Yours' was certified Platinum in Norway and received dance mixes by 7th Heaven."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"Never Alone\" is a song written by Gary Burr, Sarah Buxton, and Victoria Shaw and recorded by American songwriter and pianist Jim Brickman. Originally recorded with American country music singer Sara Evans on vocals for his 2006 album, Escape, it was famously re-recorded with American country pop trio Lady Antebellum for its release as a single. This latter version was released to digital retailers through Savoy Records on February 20, 2007 and impacted American adult contemporary radio that spring. Lady Antebellum's female vocalist, Hillary Scott, is sometimes credited individually as a featured artist alongside Lady Antebellum. \"Never Alone\" is primarily a new-age song with additional influences of country and pop genres and is instrumented primarily by piano. Its lyrics discuss the idea of unconditional love and support as well as the importance of holding onto one's faith through difficult times. The song was released to generally positive reviews, who complimented its country crossover appeal, and was a success on adult contemporary radio. It peaked at number 14 on the Billboard Adult Contemporary airplay chart in July 2007, earning Brickman his 22nd entry on the chart and 13th top-15 hit. Furthermore, the song was Lady Antebellum's first entry on a Billboard chart before their proper debut single, \"Love Don't Live Here\", was released in October of that year; they would later match this position with their own single, \"I Run to You\" in 2009 before topping the AC chart with \"Need You Now\" that same year."@en ;

In France, the song held the country's number one slot for seven weeks and as of August 2014, it was the 19th best-selling single of the 21st century in France, with 565,000 units sold. In 2004, the song was covered by 3rd Wish featuring Baby Bash produced by Mintman, but this version was less successful than the original version (#7 In Switzerland, #2 in Austria, #12 in France). Later, in 2005, the song was covered by Los Hor\u00F3scopos de Durango in their album Y Seguimos con Duranguense. Latin R&B artist Frankie J made an English and more soul-styled version of the song, featuring Baby Bash, which was called \"Obsession (No Es Amor)\".

dbr:On_the_Floor	rdf:type	dbo:MusicalWork ;
	dbo:abstract	"\"On the Floor\" is a song recorded by American recording artist Jennifer Lopez for her seventh studio album, Love? (2011). Featuring American rapper Pitbull, it was released by Island Records on February 8, 2011 as the lead single from the album. \"On the Floor\" was written by Kinda \"Kee\" Hamid, AJ Junior, Teddy Sky, Bilal \"The Chef\" Hajji, Pitbull, Gonzalo Hermosa, Ulises Hermosa, along with the song's producer RedOne. It is an up-tempo electro-house dance song with a common time tempo of 130 beats per minute. \"On the Floor\" incorporates elements of electro house and draws further musical influences from eurodance, Latin music and techno music. Lopez recorded a Spanish-language version of the song titled \"Ven a Bailar\" (English: \"Come to Dance\"), which includes additional lyrical contributions from Julio Reyes Copello and Jimena Romero. Its development was motivated by Lopez's Latin heritage and pays homage to her career-beginnings as a dancer. Interpolated within the song are recurrent elements of the 1982 composition \"Llorando se fue\" written by Gonzalo and Ulises Hermosa, a composition that gained notoriety when it was sampled by Kaoma in their 1989 single \"Lambada\". Lopez described \"On the Floor\" as an evolution of her classic sound and as something which sounded very current. The debut and release of \"On the Floor\" coincided with Lopez's appointment as a judge on the tenth season of US reality TV show American Idol, as well as several other product endorsement deals. American Idol also provided a platform to debut the single's music video, as well as the stage for Lopez's first live performance of the song. \"On the Floor\" was met with a generally positive reception from music critics, with editors from BBC Music and Los Angeles Times drawing comparisons to Lopez's debut single, \"If You Had My Love\" (1999) and follow-up single \"Waiting for Tonight\" (1999). Commercially, \"On the Floor\" is Lopez's most successful single to date, topping more than thirty national single charts. In the United States, it was Lopez's first single in four years to garner airplay, and to date has sold over four million copies, earning a triple platinum certification by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) in the USA. It resulted in being around 10th place of the biggest hit of the year, behind Rihanna, Adele, LMFAO, Bruno Mars and others, on the year-end charts; \"On the Floor\" finished in first place in Austria, Finland, Germany, Spain and Switzerland. A music video was directed by TAJ Stansberry and choreographed by Frank Gatson, Jr, with fans being given the chance to vote for their preferred ending for the video. The completed clip premiered simultaneously on Vevo and during the March 3, 2011 episode of American Idol. It depicts a Los Angeles underground club culture where Lopez portrays a \"queen of the nightclub\", among other characters. The video received critical acclaim for its lavish production, the styling and choreography, that critics felt best highlighted Lopez's abilities as a dancer. As of February 2016, \"On the Floor\" is the 25th most viewed YouTube video of all time, with over 910 million views."@en ;

dbr:Only_the_Young	rdf:type	dbo:MusicalWork ;
	dbo:abstract	"\"Only the Young\" is a song written by Jonathan Cain, Steve Perry, Neal Schon of the band Journey. It was sold to the band Scandal, who released it in 1984 on their The Warrior album. Journey also recorded and released the song and Scandal was given a large settlement in the legal aftermath. Previously intended for Journey's Frontiers album, it was pulled from the album within days of recording in favor of songs \"Back Talk\" and \"Troubled Child\". The song was eventually released as a single (which reached No. 9 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart in March 1985) and appeared on the soundtrack to the 1985 film Vision Quest. It also reached No. 3 on the Mainstream Rock chart. The song's lyrical theme focuses on young people and the hope and future they all have in front of them. The song was featured later as a bonus track on the 2006 CD reissue of Frontiers. The first individual outside the band to hear the song was sixteen-year-old Kenny Sykaluk of Rocky River, Ohio, who was diagnosed with cystic fibrosis. His mother wrote a letter to the band telling them about her son's terminal condition, and how big a fan he was of Journey. The band flew to his hospital bedside in Cleveland, Ohio at the request of the Make a Wish Foundation. Along with a Walkman containing the new track, the band also brought Kenny a football helmet signed by the San Francisco 49ers and an autographed Journey platinum record award. The experience of playing the song for Kenny left Steve Perry and Jonathan Cain deeply affected. Perry said, \"As soon as I walked out of the hospital room I lost it. Nurses had to take me to a room by myself.\" On the band's episode of VH1's Behind the Music, Cain broke down in tears recalling the event, remarking that \"children should not have to live with that kind of pain\". Kenny died the next day, with the Walkman still in his hand. The song brought life into perspective for the band and left them humbled. Neal Schon said that Kenny's death affected Journey by making them re-evaluate the issues that were causing friction inside the band itself. In honor of Kenny Sykaluk, the band used the song as their opener for the Raised on Radio Tour. The song was also recorded by American rock band Scandal in 1984. The song was featured on their album The Warrior."@en ;

It was the third and last single from Les Mots, and was released on 21 October 2002. The song is about the unhappy love of a woman who is asking for forgiveness from the Oriental princes whom she loves. The black and white accompanying music video was directed by Boutonnat in Morocco and shows Farmer dressed as a nun, with images of a knight galloping on horseback and a snake. Like the single \"\u00C0 quoi je sers...\" released thirteen years earlier, \"Pardonne-moi\" is generally deemed a synthesis of Farmer's work and thus marked the end of an artistic period in her career. The song received positive reviews from critics and became a top ten hit in France and in the Waloon Belgium, although its sales were rather disappointing."@en ;

dbr:Red_Lips	rdf:type	dbo:MusicalWork ;
	dbo:abstract	"\"Red Lips\" is a song recorded by American recording artist Sky Ferreira for her second extended play (EP) Ghost (2012). It was released on July 17, 2012 by Capitol Records. The song was written and produced by Greg Kurstin, with additional songwriting provided by Shirley Manson. \"Red Lips\" is a pop rock song that describes the emotional deterioration of an individual that Ferreira disliked. It differs from the previous electropop styles displayed in her earlier works; this was deliberately done to prevent Ferreira from being branded in a similar fashion as recording artist Britney Spears, which she felt that Capitol Records had intended to do. Despite Ghost itself garnering mixed reviews, \"Red Lips\" received generally favorable reviews from music critics, who complimented its overall production. However, the track failed to impact any national record charts. An accompanying music video for \"Red Lips\" was directed by Terry Richardson, and was premiered through Richardson's YouTube channel on June 12, 2012. Critics directed their commentaries towards Ferreira's increasingly risqu\u00E9 public persona, shifting from the more innocent image with which she launched her career."@en ;

Both the 2nd CD (of the CD release format) and the 7\" vinyl format have the \"Richard III\" cover design but with the colours altered instead. The song's name comes from the band's method of creating working titles for songs - giving them people's names. This was the third called \"Richard\" and the band liked the reference to the king Richard III and the Shakespeare play Richard III in which the king is depicted as a dark and evil character, as it matched the menacing tone of the song. Neither the king nor the play is mentioned in the song. A Peel session of the song was released on the CD single for \"Mary\"."@en ;

The single reached #6 on the Billboard Hot 100 and became their fourth #1 hit on the Billboard Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks chart, holding the top spot for four weeks, starting on December 19, 1987. \"Say You Will\" was one of Foreigner's last two Top 10 chart hits in the United States, followed by the 1988 release of the single \"I Don't Want to Live Without You\" (which reached #5 on the Hot 100 chart). The song also became the band's third-highest charting hit in Germany, where it reached #22, faring even better in Switzerland, the Netherlands, and particularly Norway, where it reached #4.

The song was well received by music critics, with many complimenting its simple yet inspirational lyrics, as well as calling it a standout track from the album. It peaked at number two on the US Billboard Hot 100, blocked by Carey's own \"We Belong Together\" and Kanye West's Gold Digger for six weeks. Furthermore, it marked the first time a female lead artist occupied the top two positions of the Hot 100. The song also peaked at numbers six and five in Australia and New Zealand, and numbers fifteen and nine in Ireland and the United Kingdom, respectively.

It was released as the second official single from the group's debut studio album Hot Fuss (2004), and was written by band members Brandon Flowers, Mark Stoermer, Dave Keuning and Ronnie Vannucci Jr.. In an interview with Rolling Stone, Brandon Flowers said \"This is the story of trying to meet someone in a club.\" It is written in the key of B-flat minor. When the Killers first started out, their music was little noticed by music-buyers and the media, which is why \"Somebody Told Me\" has been released twice in slightly different forms. The first, with the pink background cover, is the rarer version of the single as it was their first release of it; due to poor sales not as many were produced. When re-released, the cover-art sported a blue background color and is the more common version of the single. The single peaked at #51 on the US Billboard Hot 100. In the UK it charted at number 28 upon its first release in March 2004 becoming the band's first top 40 hit, it was then re-released in January 2005 and reached number 3. Although not as successful as \"Mr. Brightside\", it still became one of the band's biggest hits to date. In Australia, the song was ranked #4 on Triple J's Hottest 100 of 2004. In 2009 it was voted at Number 9 in UK radio station XFM's Top 100 songs of the decade."@en ;

A live version is available on Hannah Montana & Miley Cyrus: Best of Both Worlds Concert and as a karaoke in Cyrus's karaoke series. The song was originally written by Fefe Dobson, who passed the song to Cyrus, as she did not desire to include it on Sunday Love. The up-tempo song has prominent pop rock characteristics and is lyrically about having a second chance in a romantic relationship. The song garnered low commercial outcomes for Cyrus in several countries, compared to those of her previous single from Meet Miley Cyrus, \"See You Again\". Those countries include Australia, Canada, and the United States. The song reached its highest international peak in the Australian Singles Chart, at number 41. A video to \"Start All Over\" premiered on the Disney Channel, which received a MuchMusic Video Award nomination. The music video features Cyrus performing the song in the streets, and also includes her in a carnivallike setting. Cyrus performed the song at several venues; it was most notably performed in 2007 and 2008 the Best of Both Worlds Tour, as the opening number for her performances as herself. Cyrus again performed \"Start All Over\" once she embarked on the 2009 Wonder World Tour. The song, along with \"Fly on the Wall\" and \"Who Owns My Heart\" are the only singles released by Cyrus that haven't been certified at least platinum in the United States."@en .

It was written and produced by Carey and Rodney \"Darkchild\" Jerkins, and premiered via Facebook on November 11, 2013, as the second single from the album, following a digital release the same day worldwide. Jermaine Dupri, Carey's longtime collaborator and her then-manager, had the idea to premiere the song via Facebook to attract her die hard fans, however, Carey faced problems when an unmastered version of the song was uploaded in place of its final mix, leading the singer to premiere the intended version hours later with an apology and explanation. \"The Art of Letting Go\" is an orchestral old-school R&B song, with influences of gospel music, having piano, strings and guitar as its main instrumentation. Lyrically, the song talks about the art and the power of letting go of people and things that are not good in our lives, which can be hurtful and difficult, but extremely necessary. The song received largely positive reviews from music critics, who compared the song to her debut single, \"Vision of Love\" (1990), while also praising its minimalistic production and her vocals towards the end of the song. Despite the positive response, the song failed to impact the charts elsewhere, reaching the low regions of the countries it charted."@en ;

Produced by Swift alongside Nathan Chapman, the song was sent to mainstream radio in the United States on April 19, 2011, as the fourth single from Speak Now. Swift composed \"The Story of Us\" regarding the time when she encountered an ex-boyfriend of hers at the 2010 CMT Music Awards. At the event, the two attempted to ignore each other, which inspired Swift to compose the song. \"The Story of Us\" was met with generally mixed reviews from critics, some of whom suggested that Swift is strongest when she lets her country roots shine. Prior to its single release, the song debuted and peaked at number 41 on the Billboard Hot 100 and number 70 on the Canadian Hot 100 due to strong digital sales. It re-entered the Billboard Hot 100 at number 98 after its single release. The music video of the song was directed by Noble Jones which took place in Vanderbilt University. It premiered on May 24, 2011. The music video was met with mostly positive reception among music critics for its departure from the usual high school setting of Taylor Swift's previous videos. \"The Story of Us\" was performed live in The Ellen DeGeneres Show and it was also included in the Speak Now World Tour set list.
