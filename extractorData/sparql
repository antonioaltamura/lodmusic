dbr:Afro_Celt_Sound_System	rdf:type	dbo:Band ;
	dbo:abstract	"Afro Celt Sound System is a musical group which fuses modern electronic dance music with traditional Irish and West African music. They were originally formed in 1995 by producer-guitarist Simon Emmerson, and features a wide range of guest artists. Their albums have been released through Peter Gabriel's Real World Records, and they have frequently performed at WOMAD festivals worldwide. Their sales on the label are exceeded only by Gabriel himself. Their recording contract with Real World was for five albums, of which Volume 5: Anatomic was the last. After a number of festival dates in 2007, the band went on hiatus. In 2010, they regrouped to play a number of shows (including a return to WOMAD), releasing a re-mastered retrospective titled Capture. On 20 May 2014 Afro Celt Sound System launched a new website and with it announced the upcoming release of a new album, Born. In January 2016, a posting to that website revealed that due to a dispute with Emmerson, who announced his departure from the band in 2015, there were two active versions of the band, a version led by Emmerson and a separate line-up headed by James McNally and Martin Russell. Emmerson's version of the band plans to release the album The Source in 2016."@en ;

dbr:Black_Sabbath	rdf:type	dbo:Band ;
	dbo:abstract	"Black Sabbath are an English rock band, formed in Birmingham in 1968, by guitarist and main songwriter Tony Iommi, bassist and main lyricist Geezer Butler, singer Ozzy Osbourne, and drummer Bill Ward. The band have since experienced multiple line-up changes, with guitarist Iommi being the only constant presence in the band through the years. Originally formed in 1968 as a blues rock band, the group soon adopted the Black Sabbath moniker and began incorporating occult themes with horror-inspired lyrics and tuned-down guitars. Despite an association with these two themes, Black Sabbath also composed songs dealing with social instability, political corruption, the dangers of drug abuse and apocalyptic prophecies of the horrors of war. Osbourne's regular abuse of alcohol and other drugs led to his dismissal from the band in 1979. He was replaced by former Rainbow vocalist Ronnie James Dio. Following two albums with Dio, Black Sabbath endured countless personnel changes in the 1980s and 1990s that included vocalists Ian Gillan, Glenn Hughes, Ray Gillen and Tony Martin, as well as several drummers and bassists. In 1992, Iommi and Butler rejoined Dio and drummer Vinny Appice to record Dehumanizer. The original line-up reunited with Osbourne in 1997 and released a live album Reunion. Black Sabbath's 19th studio album, 13, which features all of the original members but Ward, was released in June 2013. Black Sabbath are often cited as pioneers of heavy metal music. The band helped define the genre with releases such as Black Sabbath (1970), Paranoid (1970) and Master of Reality (1971). They were ranked by MTV as the \"Greatest Metal Band\" of all time, and placed second in VH1's \"100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock\" list. Rolling Stone magazine ranked them number 85 in their \"100 Greatest Artists of All Time\". They have sold over 70 million records worldwide. Black Sabbath were inducted into the UK Music Hall of Fame in 2005 and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2006. They have also won two Grammy Awards for Best Metal Performance."@en ;

Later band members included Neil Finn's brother, Tim Finn, and Americans Mark Hart and Matt Sherrod. Originally active from 1985 to 1996, the band has had consistent commercial and critical success in Australia and New Zealand and international chart success in two phases, beginning with their self-titled debut album, which reached number twelve on the US Album Chart in 1987 and provided the Top Ten hits \"Don't Dream It's Over\" and \"Something So Strong\". Further international success came in the UK and Europe with their third and fourth albums, Woodface and Together Alone and the compilation album Recurring Dream, which included the hits \"Fall at Your Feet\", \"Weather with You\", \"Distant Sun\", \"Locked Out\", \"Instinct\" and \"Not the Girl You Think You Are\". Queen Elizabeth II bestowed an OBE on both Neil and Tim Finn, in June 1993, for their contribution to the music of New Zealand.

The group's original line-up consisted of Dave Gahan (lead vocals, occasional songwriter since 2005), Martin Gore (keyboards, guitar, vocals, chief songwriter after 1981), Andy Fletcher (keyboards), and Vince Clarke (keyboards, chief songwriter from 1980 until 1981). Depeche Mode released their debut record in 1981, Speak & Spell, bringing the band onto the British new wave scene. Clarke left the band after the release of the album, leaving the band as a trio to record A Broken Frame, released the following year. Gore took over lead songwriting duties and, later in 1982, Alan Wilder (keyboards, drums, occasional songwriter) officially joined the band to fill Clarke's spot, establishing a line up that would continue for the next thirteen years. The band's last albums of the 1980s, Black Celebration and Music for the Masses, established them as a dominant force on the mainstream electronic music scene. A highlight of this era was the band's concert at the Pasadena Rose Bowl, where they drew a crowd in excess of 60,000 people. In the new decade, Depeche Mode released Violator, a mainstream success. The subsequent album, Songs of Faith and Devotion, and the supporting Devotional Tour exacerbated tensions within the band to the point where Alan Wilder quit in 1995, leading to intense media and fan speculation that the band would split. Now a trio once again, the band released Ultra in 1997, recorded at the height of Gahan's near-fatal drug abuse, Gore's alcoholism and seizures and Fletcher's depression. The release of Exciter confirmed Depeche Mode's willingness to remain together, the subsequent, and very successful, Exciter Tour being their first tour in support of an original album in eight years since the Devotional Tour, although the band had toured in 1998 to support The Singles 86\u201398 compilation album. Depeche Mode have had fifty songs in the UK Singles Chart and thirteen top 10 albums in the UK charts. Depeche Mode have sold over 100 million records worldwide. Q magazine calls Depeche Mode \"the most popular electronic band the world has ever known\" and included the band in the list of the \"50 Bands That Changed the World!\". Depeche Mode also rank number 98 on VH1's \"100 Greatest Artists Of All Time\"."@en ;

The band had a No. 14 Billboard chart hit in 1980 with the single \"Whip It\", and has maintained a cult following throughout its existence. Devo's music and stage show mingle kitsch science fiction themes, deadpan surrealist humor, and mordantly satirical social commentary. Their often discordant pop songs feature unusual synthetic instrumentation and time signatures that have proven influential on subsequent popular music, particularly new wave, industrial and alternative rock artists. Devo was also a pioneer of the music video, creating many memorable clips for the LaserDisc format, with \"Whip It\" getting heavy airplay in the early days of MTV."@en ;

The band have sold more than 100 million records worldwide, making them one of the best-selling bands of all time. In 1998, selected members of Fleetwood Mac were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, and received the Brit Award for Outstanding Contribution to Music. The two most successful periods for the band were during the late 1960s British blues boom, when they were led by guitarist Peter Green and achieved a UK number one with \"Albatross\"; and from 1975 to 1987, as a more pop-oriented act, featuring Christine McVie, Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks. Fleetwood Mac's second album after the incorporation of Buckingham and Nicks, 1977's Rumours, produced four U.S. Top 10 singles (including Nicks' song \"Dreams\"), and remained at No. 1 on the American albums chart for 31 weeks, as well as reaching the top spot in various countries around the world. To date, the album has sold over 40 million copies worldwide, making it the eighth-highest-selling album of all time. The band achieved more modest success between 1971 and 1974, when the line-up included Bob Welch, during the 1990s in between the departure and return of Nicks and Buckingham, and during the 2000s between the departure and return of Christine McVie. Due to numerous lineup changes, the only original member present in the band is drummer Mick Fleetwood. Although band founder Green named the group by combining the surnames of two of his former bandmates (Fleetwood and McVie) from John Mayall's Bluesbreakers, bassist John McVie played neither on their first single nor at their first concerts, as he initially decided to stay with Mayall.

dbr:Gorillaz	rdf:type	dbo:Band ;
	dbo:abstract	"Gorillaz are an English virtual band created in 1998 by Damon Albarn and Jamie Hewlett. The band consists of four animated members: 2D (lead vocals, keyboard), Murdoc Niccals (bass guitar), Noodle (guitar, keyboard, and backing vocals) and Russel Hobbs (drums and percussion). These members are completely fictional and are not personas of any \"real life\" musicians involved in the project. Their fictional universe is explored through the band's website and music videos, as well as a number of other media, such as short cartoons. The music is a collaboration between various musicians, with Albarn being the only permanent musical contributor. Writers and critics have described their music as alternative rock, Britpop, trip hop, hip hop, electronica, indie, dub, reggae and pop. The band's 2001 debut album Gorillaz sold over seven million copies and earned them an entry in the Guinness Book of World Records as the Most Successful Virtual Band. It was nominated for the Mercury Prize in 2001, but the nomination was later withdrawn at the band's request. Their second studio album, Demon Days, released in 2005, went five times platinum in the UK, double platinum in the US, earned five Grammy Award nominations for 2006 and won one of them in the Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals category. The band has won numerous other awards, including two MTV Video Music Awards, an NME Award, three MTV Europe Music Awards, and have been nominated for nine Brit Awards. The combined sales of the Gorillaz and Demon Days albums had exceeded 15 million by 2007. The band's third studio album, Plastic Beach, was released in March 2010. Their latest album, The Fall, was released in December 2010 as a free download for fan club members, then in April 2011 as a physical release. Gorillaz plan to release new material in 2016."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"King Crimson are an English rock band formed in London in 1968. The band have undergone numerous throughout its history of which 21 musicians have been members; since 2013 it has consisted of Robert Fripp, Jakko Jakszyk, Tony Levin, Mel Collins, Pat Mastelotto, Gavin Harrison and Bill Rieflin. Fripp is the only consistent member of the group, and is considered their leader and motive force. The band has earned a large cult following. Developed from the unsuccessful trio Giles, Giles and Fripp, the band were seminal in the progressive rock genre in their first five years with their standard of instrumentation and complex song structures. Their debut album, In the Court of the Crimson King (1969), remains their most successful and influential with its elements of jazz, classical, and experimental music. Their success increased following an opening act performance for The Rolling Stones at Hyde Park, London, in 1969. Following the less successful In the Wake of Poseidon (1970), Lizard (1970), and Islands (1971), the group reached a new creative peak with Larks' Tongues in Aspic (1973), Starless and Bible Black (1974), and Red (1974). Fripp disbanded the group in 1974. In 1981, King Crimson reformed with a change in musical direction which lasted for three years. The result was Discipline (1981), Beat (1982), and Three of a Perfect Pair (1984). Fripp revived the group in 1995 and released Thrak (1995). Since 1997, several musicians have pursued aspects of the band's work and approaches through a series of related bands collectively referred to as ProjeKCts. In 2000, the band reunited once more and released The ConstruKction of Light (2000). The band's most recent album is The Power to Believe (2003). Since 2007, the band continue to perform live in various capacities. King Crimson have been influential to several other musical artists."@en ;

The band was fronted by both H\u00FCtter and Schneider until Schneider's departure in 2008. The signature Kraftwerk sound combines driving, repetitive rhythms with catchy melodies, mainly following a Western classical style of harmony, with a minimalistic and strictly electronic instrumentation. The group's simplified lyrics are at times sung through a vocoder or generated by computer-speech software. Kraftwerk was one of the first groups to popularize electronic music and are considered to be pioneers. In the 1970s and early 1980s, Kraftwerk's distinctive sound was revolutionary; the band has had a lasting effect across many genres of modern music. According to The Observer, \"no other band since the Beatles has given so much to pop culture\" and a wide range of artists have been influenced by their music and imagery. In January 2014, the Grammy Academy honored Kraftwerk with a Lifetime Achievement Award."@en ;

Their lineup consists of Fred Durst (lead vocals), Sam Rivers (bass guitar, backing vocals), John Otto (drums, percussions), and Wes Borland (guitars, backing vocals). Their work is marked by Durst's abrasive, angry lyrics and Borland's sonic experimentation and elaborate visual appearance, which includes face and body paint, masks and uniforms, as well as the band's elaborate live shows. The band has been nominated for three Grammy Awards, have sold 40 million records worldwide and won several other awards. Formed in 1994, Limp Bizkit became popular playing in the Jacksonville, Florida underground music scene in the late 1990s, and signed with Flip Records, a subsidiary of Interscope, which released their debut album, Three Dollar Bill, Y'all$ (1997). The band achieved mainstream success with their second and third studio albums, Significant Other (1999) and Chocolate Starfish and the Hot Dog Flavored Water (2000), although this success was marred by a series of controversies surrounding their performances at Woodstock '99 and the 2001 Big Day Out festival. Borland left the group in 2001, but Durst, Rivers, Otto and Lethal continued to record and tour with guitarist Mike Smith. Following the release of their album, Results May Vary (2003), Borland rejoined the band and recorded The Unquestionable Truth (Part 1) (2005) with Durst, Rivers, Lethal and drummer Sammy Siegler before entering a hiatus. In 2009, the band reunited with Borland playing guitar and began touring, culminating with the recording of the album Gold Cobra (2011), after which they left Interscope and later signed with Cash Money Records, but DJ Lethal was asked to leave the band soon after. They are currently recording their seventh studio album, Stampede of the Disco Elephants."@en ;

Their following studio album Meteora continued the band's success, topping the Billboard 200 album chart in 2003, and was followed by extensive touring and charity work around the world. In 2003, MTV2 named Linkin Park the sixth-greatest band of the music video era and the third-best of the new millennium. Billboard ranked Linkin Park No. 19 on the Best Artists of the Decade chart. In 2012, the band was voted as the greatest artist of the 2000s in a Bracket Madness poll on VH1. In 2014, the band was declared as the Biggest Rock Band in the World Right Now by Kerrang!. Having adapted nu metal and rap metal to a radio-friendly yet densely layered style in Hybrid Theory and Meteora, the band explored other genres in their next studio album, Minutes to Midnight (2007). The album topped the Billboard charts and had the third-best debut week of any album that year. The band continued to explore a wider variation of musical types in their fourth album, A Thousand Suns (2010), layering their music with more electronic sounds and beats. Their fifth album, Living Things (2012), combines musical elements from all of their previous records. Their sixth and most recent album, The Hunting Party (2014), returned to a heavier rock sound. The band has collaborated with several other artists, most notably with rapper Jay Z in their mashup EP Collision Course, and many others on the remix albums Reanimation and Recharged. Linkin Park has sold over 68 million albums worldwide and has won two Grammy Awards."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Marilyn Manson is an American rock band from Fort Lauderdale, Florida. Formed in 1989 by frontman Marilyn Manson and Daisy Berkowitz, the group was originally named Marilyn Manson & the Spooky Kids with their theatrical performances gathering a local cult following in the early 1990s. The band's lineup has changed between many of their album releases; the current members of Marilyn Manson are the eponymous lead singer (the only remaining original member), bassist Twiggy Ramirez, guitarist Paul Wiley, keyboardist/percussionist Daniel Fox, and drummer Gil Sharone. Until 1996, the name of each member was originally created by combining the first name of an iconic female sex symbol and the last name of an iconic serial killer (e.g., Marilyn Monroe and Charles Manson). The members of the band dress in outlandish makeup and costumes, and have engaged in intentionally shocking behavior both onstage and off. In the past, their lyrics often received criticism for their anti-religious sentiment and references to sex, violence and drugs. Their performances have frequently been called offensive and obscene, and, on several occasions, protests and petitions have led to the group being banned from performing. As this controversy began to wane throughout the 2000s, so did the band's mainstream popularity. Despite this, Jon Wiederhorn of MTV.com, in June 2003, referred to Marilyn Manson as \"the only true artist today\". Marilyn Manson has garnered much success: in the US, three of the band's albums have been certified platinum while three more were certified gold, and the band has seen eight of its releases debut in the top ten, including two number-one albums. VH1 has ranked Marilyn Manson as the seventy-eighth best rock band on their 100 Great Artists of Hard Rock. Aggregate site AcclaimedMusic.net lists Marilyn Manson number 714 in their artist rank for greatest of all time. Marilyn Manson has sold over 50 million records."@en ;

The Kirkwood brothers met Bostrom while attending Brophy Prep High School in Phoenix. The three then moved to Tempe, Arizona (a Phoenix suburb and home to Arizona State University) where the Kirkwood brothers purchased two adjacent homes, one of which had a shed in the back where they regularly practiced. Meat Puppets started as a punk rock band, but like most of their labelmates on SST Records, they established their own unique style, blending punk with country and psychedelic rock, and featuring Curt's warbling vocals. Meat Puppets later gained significant exposure when the Kirkwood brothers served as guest musicians on Nirvana's MTV Unplugged performance in 1993. The band's 1994 album Too High to Die subsequently became their most successful release. The band broke up twice, in 1996 and 2002, but reunited again in 2006.

dbr:Megadeth	rdf:type	dbo:Band ;
	dbo:abstract	"Megadeth is an American thrash metal band from Los Angeles, California. The group was formed in 1983 by guitarist Dave Mustaine and bassist David Ellefson, shortly after Mustaine's dismissal from Metallica. A pioneer of the American thrash metal scene, the band is credited as one of the genre's \"big four\" with Anthrax, Metallica and Slayer, responsible for thrash metal's development and popularization. Megadeth plays in a technical style, featuring fast rhythm sections and complex arrangements; themes of death, war, politics and religion are prominent in the group's lyrics. In 1985, the band released its debut album, Killing Is My Business... and Business Is Good!, on the independent label Combat Records. The album's moderate commercial success caught the attention of bigger labels, which led to Megadeth signing with Capitol Records. Their first major-label album, Peace Sells... but Who's Buying?, was released in 1986 and influenced the underground metal scene. Despite its prominence in thrash metal, frequent disputes between its members and substance abuse issues brought Megadeth negative publicity during this period. After the lineup stabilized, the band released a number of platinum-selling albums, including Rust in Peace (1990) and Countdown to Extinction (1992). These albums, along with touring worldwide, helped bring public recognition to Megadeth. The band temporarily disbanded in 2002 when Mustaine suffered an arm injury and re-established in 2004 without bassist Ellefson, who had taken legal action against Mustaine. Ellefson settled with Mustaine out of court and rejoined the group in 2010. Megadeth has hosted its own music festival, Gigantour, several times since mid-2005. As of 2014, Megadeth has sold 50 million records worldwide, earned platinum certification in the United States for five of its fifteen studio albums, and received eleven Grammy nominations. The band's mascot, Vic Rattlehead, regularly appears on album artwork and, since 2010, in live shows. The group has experienced controversy over its musical approach and lyrics, including canceled concerts and album bans. MTV has refused to play two of the band's videos that the network considered to condone suicide."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Metallica is an American heavy metal band formed in Los Angeles, California. Metallica was formed in 1981 when vocalist/guitarist James Hetfield responded to an advertisement posted by drummer Lars Ulrich in a local newspaper. The band's current line-up comprises founding members Hetfield and Ulrich, longtime lead guitarist Kirk Hammett and bassist Robert Trujillo. Lead guitarist Dave Mustaine and bassists Ron McGovney, Cliff Burton and Jason Newsted are former members of the band. Metallica collaborated over a long period with producer Bob Rock, who produced all of the band's albums from 1990 to 2003 and served as a temporary bassist between the departure of Newsted and the hiring of Trujillo. The band's fast tempos, instrumentals, and aggressive musicianship placed them as one of the founding \"big four\" bands of thrash metal, alongside Anthrax, Megadeth, and Slayer. The band earned a growing fan base in the underground music community and won critical acclaim with its first four albums; their third album Master of Puppets (1986) was described as one of the most influential and heaviest of thrash metal albums. Metallica achieved substantial commercial success with its eponymous fifth album Metallica (1991), which debuted at number one on the Billboard 200. With this release the band expanded its musical direction, resulting in an album that appealed to a more mainstream audience. In 2000, Metallica was among a number of artists who filed a lawsuit against Napster for sharing the band's copyright-protected material for free without consent from any band member. A settlement was reached and Napster became a pay-to-use service. Despite reaching number one on the Billboard 200, the release of St. Anger (2003) alienated many fans with the exclusion of guitar solos and the \"steel-sounding\" snare drum. A film titled Some Kind of Monster documented the recording of St. Anger and the tensions within the band during that time. In 2009, Metallica was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Metallica has released nine studio albums, four live albums, five extended plays, 26 music videos, and 37 singles. The band has won eight Grammy Awards and five of its albums have consecutively debuted at number one on the Billboard 200. The band's eponymous 1991 album has sold over 16 million copies in the United States, making it the best-selling album of the SoundScan era. Metallica ranks as one of the most commercially successful bands of all time, having sold over 110 million records worldwide. Metallica has been listed as one of the greatest artists of all time by many magazines, including Rolling Stone, which ranked them 61st on its list of The 100 Greatest Artists of All Time. As of December 2012, Metallica is the third best-selling music artist since Nielsen SoundScan began tracking sales in 1991, selling a total of 54.26 million albums in the U.S. In 2012, Metallica formed the independent record label Blackened Recordings and took full ownership of its albums and videos. As of 2016, the band is in production of its tenth studio album, which is expected to be released later in the year."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"New Order are an English rock band formed in 1980, currently consisting of founding members Bernard Sumner, Stephen Morris and Gillian Gilbert, alongside Phil Cunningham and Tom Chapman. The band was formed in 1980 by Sumner (vocals, guitars, keyboards and synthesisers), ex member Peter Hook (bass and vocals) and Morris (drums, electronic drums, keyboards and synthesizers) \u2013 the remaining members of post-punk group Joy Division, following the suicide of vocalist Ian Curtis \u2013 with the addition of Gilbert (keyboards, synthesizers and guitars). By combining post-punk with an increasing influence from electronic dance music, New Order became one of the most critically acclaimed and influential bands of the 1980s. Though the band's early years were shadowed by the legacy and basic sound of Joy Division, their experience of the early 1980s New York City club scene increased their knowledge of dance music and helped them incorporate elements of that style into their work. The band's 1983 hit \"Blue Monday\", the best-selling 12-inch single of all time, is one example of how the band's sound became increasingly upbeat and electronic. New Order were the flagship band for Manchester-based independent record label Factory Records. Their unlabelled album sleeves and \"non-image\" (the band rarely gave interviews and were known for performing short concert sets with no encores) reflected the label's aesthetic of doing whatever the relevant parties wanted to do, including an aversion to including singles as album tracks. Because of the band's dance-rock genre it has a complex discography, with many well-known songs not featured on studio albums or released in a variety of mixes. Throughout their career, the band's records were carefully art-directed by Mancunian designer Peter Saville. The group disbanded in 1993 to work on individual projects, and reunited in 1998. In 2001, Cunningham (guitars, keyboards and synthesisers) replaced Gilbert, who took a sabbatical from the band because of family commitments. In 2007, Peter Hook left the band. After Hook's departure, Bernard, Phil and Stephen worked on Bad Lieutenant and the band reunited in 2011 without Hook, with Gilbert's return and Chapman replacing Hook on bass. During the band's career and in between lengthy breaks, band members have been involved in several solo projects, such as Sumner's Electronic and Bad Lieutenant; Hook's Monaco and Revenge and Gilbert and Morris' The Other Two. Cunningham was previously a member of Marion and with Sumner and Chapman was a member of Bad Lieutenant. In September 2015, the band released its tenth studio album, Music Complete."@en ;

In the late 1980s Nirvana established itself as part of the Seattle grunge scene, releasing its first album Bleach for the independent record label Sub Pop in 1989. The band eventually came to develop a sound that relied on dynamic contrasts, often between quiet verses and loud, heavy choruses. After signing to major label DGC Records, Nirvana found unexpected success with \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\", the first single from the band's second album Nevermind (1991). Nirvana's sudden success widely popularized alternative rock as a whole, and the band's frontman Cobain found himself referred to in the media as the \"spokesman of a generation\", with Nirvana being considered the \"flagship band\" of Generation X. In response, Nirvana's third studio album, In Utero (1993), featured an abrasive, less-mainstream sound and challenged the group's audience. The album did not match the sales figures of Nevermind, but was still a commercial success and critically acclaimed. Nirvana's brief run ended following the death of Kurt Cobain in 1994, but various posthumous releases have been issued since, overseen by Novoselic, Grohl, and Cobain's widow Courtney Love. Since its debut, the band has sold over 25 million records in the United States alone, and over 75 million records worldwide, making them one of the best-selling bands of all time. Nirvana was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2014, in its first year of eligibility."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"The Pixies are an American alternative rock band formed in 1986 in Boston, Massachusetts. The group disbanded in 1993 in acrimonious circumstances, but reunited in 2004. The group currently consists of founders Black Francis (lead vocals, rhythm guitar), Joey Santiago (lead guitar), and David Lovering (drums). Co-founder Kim Deal (bass, backing vocals) left in 2013 and was replaced by Kim Shattuck as live bass player for a few months, then by Paz Lenchantin for the band's 2014 tour. The Pixies achieved relatively modest popularity in their home country, but were significantly more successful in the United Kingdom, mainland Europe and Israel. The group is credited with having an influence on the alternative rock boom of the 1990s. The band's style of music contains a range of elements, including psychedelia, noise pop, hard rock, surf pop, and surf rock. Black Francis is the Pixies' primary songwriter and singer. His lyrics feature a number of offbeat subjects such as extraterrestrials, surrealism, incest, and biblical violence. Despite limited commercial success, their jarring pop sound subsequently influenced bands such as Nirvana, Radiohead, The Strokes, Blur and Weezer. The Pixies' legacy and popularity grew in the years following their break-up, leading to sold-out world tours following their reunion in 2004. In June 2013, the band released their first new material in almost 10 years."@en ;

dbr:Red_Hot_Chili_Peppers	rdf:type	dbo:Band ;
	dbo:abstract	"Red Hot Chili Peppers, also sometimes shortened to \"The Chili Peppers\" or abbreviated as \"RHCP\", are an American rock band formed in Los Angeles in 1983. The group's musical style primarily consists of rock with an emphasis on funk, as well as elements from other genres such as punk rock and psychedelic rock. When played live, their music incorporates elements of jam band due to the improvised nature of much of their performances. Currently, the band consists of founding members Anthony Kiedis (vocals), Flea (bass), longtime drummer Chad Smith; and guitarist Josh Klinghoffer, who joined in late-2009, replacing John Frusciante. Red Hot Chili Peppers have won seven Grammy Awards and have become one of the best-selling bands of all time, selling over 80 million records worldwide. In 2012, they were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. The band's original line-up featured guitarist Hillel Slovak and drummer Jack Irons, alongside Kiedis and Flea. Because of commitments to other bands, Slovak and Irons did not play on the band's self-titled debut album (1984). Cliff Martinez was the drummer for the first two records (Irons played on the third), and guitarist Jack Sherman played on the first. Slovak performed on the second and third albums by the band Freaky Styley (1985) and The Uplift Mofo Party Plan (1987), but he died from a heroin overdose in 1988. As a result of his friend's death, Irons chose to depart from the group as drummer. Parliament-Funkadelic guitarist DeWayne McKnight was brought in to replace Slovak, though his tenure was short, which forced Frusciante to replace him in 1988. Former Dead Kennedys drummer D.H. Peligro was brought in to replace Irons. His tenure was also short, so he was replaced by Chad Smith that same year. The line-up of Flea, Kiedis, Frusciante, and Smith was the longest-lasting and recorded five studio albums beginning with Mother's Milk (1989). In 1990, the group signed with Warner Bros. Records and recorded the album Blood Sugar Sex Magik (1991) under producer Rick Rubin. This album became the band's first commercial success. Frusciante grew uncomfortable with the success of the band and left abruptly in 1992, in the middle of the Blood Sugar Sex Magik Tour. After two temporary guitarists, Dave Navarro of Jane's Addiction joined for the group's subsequent album, One Hot Minute (1995). Although commercially successful, the album failed to match the critical or popular acclaim of Blood Sugar Sex Magik, selling less than half as much as its predecessor. Navarro was fired from the band in 1998. Frusciante, fresh out of drug rehabilitation, rejoined the band that same year at Flea's request. The reunited quartet returned to the studio to record Californication (1999), which became the band's biggest commercial success with 16 million copies worldwide. That album was followed three years later by By the Way (2002), and then four years later by the double album Stadium Arcadium (2006), their first number-one album in America. After a world tour, the group went on an extended hiatus. Frusciante announced he was amicably leaving the band in 2009 to focus on his solo career. Klinghoffer who had worked both as a sideman for the band on their Stadium Arcadium tour and on Frusciante's solo projects, replaced him as lead guitarist. The band's tenth studio album, I'm with You, was released in 2011 and topped the charts in 18 different countries. The group toured into 2014 and performed with Bruno Mars as a part of the halftime performance at Super Bowl XLVIII. The band is currently recording their eleventh studio album, expected to be released in 2016."@en ;

The band is composed of bassist, keyboardist, and lead vocalist Geddy Lee; guitarist and backing vocalist Alex Lifeson; and drummer, percussionist, and lyricist Neil Peart. The band and its membership went through several reconfigurations between 1968 and 1974, achieving its current lineup when Peart replaced original drummer John Rutsey in July 1974, two weeks before the group's first United States tour. Rush is known for its musicianship, complex compositions, and eclectic lyrical motifs drawing heavily on science fiction, fantasy, and philosophy. The band's musical style has changed several times over the years, from a blues-inspired hard rock beginning, later moving into progressive rock, and including a period marked by heavy use of synthesizers. In the early 1990s, Rush returned to a guitar-driven hard rock sound, which has continued to the present. The band's latest studio album, Clockwork Angels (2012) won the Album Of The Year Award from Progressive Music Awards. The supporting tour ran from September 2012 to August 2013. According to the RIAA Rush ranks 80th with sales of 25 million units in the U.S. Although total worldwide album sales are not calculated by any single entity, several industry sources estimated Rush's total worldwide album sales at over 40 million units as of 2004. The group has been awarded 24 gold, 14 platinum, and 3 multi-platinum albums. Rush has received seven Grammy award nominations, but has not won the award. The band has won several Juno Awards, was inducted into the Canadian Music Hall of Fame in 1994, and inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2013. Over their careers, the members of Rush have been acknowledged as some of the most proficient players on their respective instruments, with each band member winning numerous awards in magazine readers' polls. Rush announced plans to stop large-scale touring at the end of 2015. However, they have not ruled out the possibility of future studio albums and smaller-scale tours."@en ;

dbr:The_Beach_Boys	rdf:type	dbo:Band ;
	dbo:abstract	"The Beach Boys are an American rock band formed in Hawthorne, California in 1961. The group's original lineup consisted of brothers Brian, Dennis, and Carl Wilson, their cousin Mike Love, and their friend Al Jardine. They emerged at the vanguard of the \"California Sound\", performing original surf songs that gained international popularity for their distinct vocal harmonies and lyrics reflecting a southern California youth culture of surfing, cars, and romance. Influenced by jazz-based vocal groups, 1950s rock and roll, and doo-wop, Brian led the band in devising novel approaches to music production, arranging his compositions for studio orchestras, and experimenting with several genres ranging from pop ballads to psychedelic and baroque. The group began as a garage band managed by the Wilsons' father Murry, with Brian's creative ambitions and sophisticated songwriting abilities dominating the group's musical direction. After 1964, their albums took a different stylistic path that featured more personal lyrics, multi-layered sounds, and recording experiments. In 1966, the Pet Sounds album and \"Good Vibrations\" single vaunted the group to the top level of rock innovators and established the band as symbols of the nascent counterculture era. Following the dissolution of Smile, Brian gradually ceded control to the rest of the band, reducing his input because of mental health and substance abuse issues. Though the more democratic incarnation of the Beach Boys recorded a string of albums in various music styles that garnered international critical success, the group struggled to reclaim their commercial momentum in America. Since the 1980s, much-publicized legal wrangling over royalties, songwriting credits and use of the band's name transpired. Dennis drowned in 1983 and Carl died of lung cancer in 1998. After Carl's death, many live configurations of the band fronted by Mike Love and Bruce Johnston continued to tour into the 2000s while other members pursued solo projects. For the band's 50th anniversary, the surviving co-founders briefly reunited for a new studio album and world tour. The Beach Boys are regarded as the most iconic American band and one of the most critically acclaimed, commercially successful, and widely influential bands of all time, while AllMusic stated that their \"unerring ability... made them America's first, best rock band.\" The group had over eighty songs chart worldwide, thirty-six of them US Top 40 hits (the most by an American rock band), four reaching number-one on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. The Beach Boys have sold in excess of 100 million records worldwide, making them one of the world's best-selling bands of all time and are listed at number 12 on Rolling Stone magazine's 2004 list of the \"100 Greatest Artists of All Time\". They have received one Grammy Award for The Smile Sessions (2011). The core quintet of the three Wilsons, Love and Jardine were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1988."@en ;

Gray died on May 24, 2010, and was replaced from 2011\u201314 by former guitarist Donnie Steele. Jordison left the band on December 12, 2013.

	dbo:abstract	"The Human League are an English electronic new wave band formed in Sheffield in 1977. Dare (1981), the band's most popular album, yielded the single \"Don't You Want Me\", a No. 1 hit in the pop charts of UK, US and many other countries. After its UK success, their first single, \"Being Boiled\", was reissued and became a top ten hit at the beginning of 1982. They received the Brit Award for Best British Breakthrough act in 1982. The success of \"Don't You Want Me\" is seen as the beginning of the MTV-driven Second British Invasion of the US. Other international hits include: \"Love Action\", \"Open Your Heart\", \"Mirror Man\", \"Fascination\", \"The Lebanon\", \"Human\" (a US No. 1) and \"Tell Me When\". The only constant band member since 1977 is vocalist and songwriter Philip Oakey. Originally an avant-garde all-male synthesizer-based group, The Human League evolved into a commercially successful synthpop band under Oakey's leadership. Since 1987, the band has essentially been a trio of Oakey and long-serving female vocalists Joanne Catherall and Susan Ann Sulley (both of whom joined the ensemble in 1980), with various sidemen. Since 1978, The Human League have released nine studio albums, four EPs, 30 singles and several compilation albums. They have had five albums and eight singles in the UK Top 10 and have sold more than 20 million records."@en ;

A fourth member, rapper Jarobi White, left the group after their first album in 1991. He continued to contribute to the band sporadically before rejoining for their 2006 reunion. Along with De La Soul, the group was a central part of the Native Tongues Posse, and enjoyed the most commercial success out of all the groups to emerge from that collective. Many of their songs, such as \"Bonita Applebum\", \"Can I Kick It?\", \"I Left My Wallet in El Segundo\", \"Scenario\", \"Check the Rhime\", \"Jazz (We've Got)\", \"Award Tour\" and \"Electric Relaxation\" are regarded as classics. The group released five albums between 1990 and 1998 and disbanded in 1998. In 2006, the group reunited and toured the US. The group is regarded as pioneers of alternative hip hop music, having helped to pave the way for many innovative artists. John Bush of AllMusic called them \"the most intelligent, artistic rap group during the 1990s,\" while the editors of About.com ranked them #4 on their list of the \"25 Best Rap Groups of All Time.\" In 2005, A Tribe Called Quest received a Special Achievement Award at the Billboard R&B Hip-Hop Awards in Atlanta. In 2007, the group was formally honored at the 4th VH1 Hip Hop Honors."@en ;

They are widely regarded as among the pioneers of hardcore punk, though the band's members have objected to this term to describe their music. They are also an adept reggae band, while later recordings featured elements of other genres like funk, heavy metal, hip hop and soul. Bad Brains are followers of the Rastafari movement. Originally formed as a jazz fusion ensemble under the name Mind Power, Bad Brains developed a very fast and intense punk rock sound which came to be labeled \"hardcore\", and was often played faster and more emphatically than the music of many of their peers. The unique factor of the band's music was the fact that they played more complex rhythms than other hardcore punk bands, also adapting non-punk style guitar riffs and solos into their songs. Bad Brains have released nine studio albums (one of which is entirely composed of instrumental versions of their past material). The band broke up and reformed several times over the years, sometimes with different singers or drummers. Since 1998, the \"classic\" lineup of singer H.R. (Human Rights), guitarist Dr. Know, bassist Darryl Jenifer, and drummer Earl Hudson (H.R.'s younger brother) has reunited, albeit performing sporadically."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Boyz II Men is an American R&B vocal group, best known for emotional ballads and a cappella harmonies. Formerly a quartet featuring Michael McCary, they are currently a trio composed of baritone Nathan Morris alongside tenors Wanya Morris and Shawn Stockman. During the 1990s, Boyz II Men found fame on Motown Records as a quartet. McCary left the group in 2003 due to health issues. During the 1990s, Boyz II Men gained international success. This began with the release of the number one single \"End of the Road\" in 1992, which reached the top of charts worldwide. \"End of the Road\" would set a new record for longevity, staying at number one on the Billboard Hot 100 for thirteen weeks, breaking the decades-old record held by Elvis Presley. Boyz II Men proceeded to break this record with the subsequent releases of \"I'll Make Love to You\" and \"One Sweet Day\" (with Mariah Carey), which, at fourteen and sixteen weeks respectively, each set new records for the total number of weeks at number one. \"I'll Make Love to You\" also topped the charts in Australia (for four weeks) and garnered international success. As of 2015, \"One Sweet Day\" still holds the all-time record with sixteen weeks at the top of the Hot 100. Consequently, Boyz II Men are top ranking members with regard to time spent at number one in Billboard history, ranking in the fourth spot with 50 weeks (as of 2014). Furthermore, when \"On Bended Knee\" took the number 1 spot away from \"I'll Make Love to You\", Boyz II Men became only the third artists ever (after The Beatles and Presley) to replace themselves at the top of the Billboard Hot 100. Boyz II Men are among a select group of artists that have held at the number-one spot for at least 50 weeks cumulatively, placing them just fourth on that list behind Elvis Presley, The Beatles, and Mariah Carey. These achievements were enough to earn Boyz II Men recognition as Billboard magazine's fourth most successful musical group of the 1990s. Boyz II Men continue to perform worldwide, as a trio. Their most recent studio album, Collide, was released in 2014."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Duran Duran are an English new wave/synthpop band formed in Birmingham in 1978. They were a successful band of the 1980s and a leading band in the MTV-driven \"Second British Invasion\" of the US. Since the 1980s, they have placed 14 singles in the Top 10 of the UK Singles Chart and 21 in the Billboard Hot 100, and have sold over 70 million records. While they were generally considered part of the New Romantic scene, along with bands such as Spandau Ballet, when they first emerged, the band later shed this image. The band worked with fashion designers to build a sharp and elegant image. The band has won a number of awards throughout their career: two Brit Awards including the 2004 award for Outstanding Contribution to Music, two Grammy Awards, and an MTV Video Music Award for Lifetime Achievement. They were also awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. The band's controversial videos, which included partial nudity and suggestions of sexuality, became popular in the early 1980s on the then-new music video channel, MTV. Duran Duran were among the first bands to have their videos shot by professional directors with 35 mm film movie cameras, which gave their videos a much more polished look than was standard at the time. In 1984, the band were early innovators with video technology in their live stadium shows. The group was formed by keyboardist Nick Rhodes and bassist John Taylor, with the later addition of drummer Roger Taylor, and after numerous personnel changes, guitarist Andy Taylor and lead singer Simon Le Bon. These five members featured in their most commercially successful line-up. The group has never disbanded, but after separation of Andy Taylor in 1986, the line-up has changed to include former Missing Persons guitarist Warren Cuccurullo from 1989 to 2001 and drummer Sterling Campbell from 1989 to 1991. The reunion of the original five members in the early 2000s created a stir among the band's fans and music media. Andy Taylor left the band once again in mid-2006, and guitarist Dom Brown has since been working with the band as a session player and touring member."@en ;

Live's original lead singer Ed Kowalczyk left the band in November 2009. Live achieved worldwide success with their 1994 album, Throwing Copper, which has sold eight million copies in the U.S. The band had a string of hit singles in the mid-1990s including \"Lightning Crashes\", which stayed at the top of the Billboard Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks chart for 10 consecutive weeks and the Modern Rock Tracks (now Alternative Songs) chart for nine weeks from February 25 to April 22, 1995. The band has sold over 20 million albums worldwide. Their last three studio albums fared only moderately well in the U.S., but they continued to enjoy success in The Netherlands, South Africa, Australasia and Brazil. When touring, Live have used additional musicians, most notably Ed's younger brother Adam Kowalczyk on rhythm guitar and backing vocals. British keyboard player Michael \"Railo\" Railton and guitarist Christopher Thorn of the band Blind Melon have also toured with Live. On November 30, 2009, Taylor revealed that what had initially been termed a \"two-year hiatus\" was more likely the end of the band, due to what he felt were inappropriate actions by Ed Kowalczyk, which have resulted in a lawsuit being filed against him by the other three band members. Kowalczyk alleged that he wrote most of the music for Live and a new publishing arrangement had been accepted by all members of the group in 2006. In June 2011, Taylor revealed that he, Gracey and Dahlheimer were to reform Live without Kowalczyk, who confirmed that he would not work with the other three again. In March 2012, Shinn, formerly of the band Unified Theory, replaced Kowalczyk as lead singer. The band's first album featuring Shinn, The Turn, was released on October 28, 2014."@en ;

dbr:The_Temptations	rdf:type	dbo:Band ;
	dbo:abstract	"The Temptations are an American vocal group known for their success with Motown Records during the 1960s and 1970s. Known for their choreography, distinct harmonies, and flashy wardrobe, the group was highly influential to the evolution of R&B and soul music. Having sold tens of millions of albums, the Temptations are one of the most successful groups in music history. As of 2015, the Temptations continue to perform with one living original member, Otis Williams, still in the lineup. Featuring five male vocalists and dancers (save for brief periods with less or more members), the group formed in 1960 in Detroit, Michigan under the name \"The Elgins\". The original founding members were originally members of two rival Detroit vocal groups: Otis Williams, Elbridge \"Al\" Bryant, and Melvin Franklin of Otis Williams & the Distants, and Eddie Kendricks and Paul Williams of the Primes. In 1964, Bryant was replaced by David Ruffin, who was the lead vocalist on a number of the group's biggest hits, including \"My Girl\" (1964), \"Ain't Too Proud to Beg\" (1966), and \"I Wish It Would Rain\" (1967). Ruffin was replaced in 1968 by Dennis Edwards, with whom the group continued to record hit records such as \"Cloud Nine\" (1969) and \"Ball of Confusion (That's What the World is Today)\" (1970). The group's lineup has changed frequently since the departures of Kendricks and Paul Williams from the act in 1971. Later members of the group have included singers such as Richard Street, Damon Harris, Ron Tyson, and Ali-Ollie Woodson, with whom the group scored a late-period hit in 1984 with \"Treat Her Like a Lady\". Over the course of their career, the Temptations have released four Billboard Hot 100 number-one singles and fourteen R&B number-one singles, and their material has earned them three Grammy Awards. The Temptations were the first Motown recording act to win a Grammy Award - for \"Cloud Nine\" in 1969 - and in 2013 received the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award. Six of the Temptations (Edwards, Franklin, Kendricks, Ruffin, Otis Williams and Paul Williams) were inducted to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1989. Three classic Temptations songs, \"My Girl\", \"Just My Imagination (Running Away with Me)\", and \"Papa Was a Rollin' Stone\", are among The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll. The Temptations were also ranked at number 68 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 100 Greatest Artists of all time."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Thulsa Doom is a Norwegian stoner rock band. It takes its name from the Robert E. Howard character. The band was formed in 1999 by guitarist Ole Petter Andreassen (also a member of The Cumshots and Black Debbath), under the stage name El Doom. He was joined by his Black Debbath colleague, bass player Egil Hegerberg, using the name Angelov Doom, as well as singer Papa Doom guitarist Doom Perignon and drummer Fast Winston Doom. The band's music is somewhat similar to stoner rock legends Kyuss and early Black Sabbath. The band's debut release She Fucks Me was released in 2000. The five-track EP has a picture of Bill Clinton on the cover. Thulsa Doom have since released three full-length albums. One of their trademarks is very long and strange album titles. Singer Papa Doom left the band in 2003, and guitarist Doom Perignon is now the band's singer. The band's latest album Keyboard, Oh Lord! Why Don't We? is a bit less heavy and more melodic than the previous albums. Their cover version of Beach Boys's Tears in the Morning was a minor TV hit in Norway in the summer of 2005 with a video directed by Jarle Medhus."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"10cc are an English art rock band founded in Stockport who achieved their greatest commercial success in the 1970s. The band initially consisted of four musicians\u2014Graham Gouldman, Eric Stewart, Kevin Godley, and Lol Creme\u2014who had written and recorded together for some three years, before assuming the name \"10cc\" in 1972. 10cc featured two songwriting teams, one \"commercial\" and one \"artistic\". Stewart and Gouldman were predominantly pop-songwriters, who created most of the band's accessible songs. By way of contrast, Godley and Creme were the predominantly experimental half of 10cc, featuring an Art School sensibility and cinematic inspired writing. Every member of 10cc was a multi-instrumentalist, singer, writer and producer, and the writing teams frequently switched partners, so that Godley/Gouldman or Creme/Stewart compositions were not uncommon. After Godley and Creme left the band in 1976, Gouldman and Stewart were the main creative forces behind 10cc. Stewart left the band in 1996, and Gouldman continues to lead a touring version of 10cc. Most of the band's albums were recorded at their own Strawberry Studios (North) in Stockport and Strawberry Studios (South) in Dorking, with most of those engineered by Stewart. 10cc were co-managed by Ric Dixon and Harvey Lisberg at Kennedy Street, who had represented the individual members of the band since the mid-1960s."@en ;

Despite their name, Beirut had never performed in Lebanon until they appeared at the Byblos International Festival in August 2014. Here is an explanation of band's name by Condon: \u201COne of the reasons I named the band after that city was the fact that it\u2019s seen a lot of conflict. It\u2019s not a political position. I worried about that from the beginning. But it was such a catchy name. I mean, if things go down that are truly horrible, I\u2019ll change it. But not now.

Closely linked to the CKY Crew, which features Margera's brother Bam, the band found initial recognition through its musical contributions to the CKY video series and the TV series Jackass. Originally known by the full name Camp Kill Yourself, and later credited briefly as simply Camp, the band released its debut album Volume 1 in 1999, largely made up of material recorded for the CKY films. The group later signed with The Island Def Jam Music Group and released Infiltrate\u2022Destroy\u2022Rebuild in 2002, which gave the band its first experience of US chart success. An Answer Can Be Found followed in 2005, with latest studio album Carver City released by Roadrunner Records in 2009. CKY has been categorised as a band of multiple musical genres, including alternative metal, post-grunge and skate punk. The band's songwriting was typically led by Miller, with production, engineering and mixing handled by Ginsburg. In recent years, internal tensions between band members have halted progress on new material and touring; Ginsburg, Margera and Deis have retained the CKY name, while Miller has returned to using the Foreign Objects moniker, as well as that of MechaCKY."@en ;

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dragon_(band)>	rdf:type	dbo:Band ;
	dbo:abstract	"Dragon are a rock band which were formed in Auckland, New Zealand in January 1972 and relocated to Sydney, Australia in May 1975. They were originally fronted by singer Marc Hunter and are currently led by his brother, bass player/vocalist Todd Hunter. They performed and released material under the name Hunter in Europe and the United States during 1987. Keyboard player Paul Hewson wrote or co-wrote most of the group's 1970s hits: \"April Sun in Cuba\" peaked at #2 on the 1977 Australian singles chart; \"Are You Old Enough?\" reached #1 in 1978; and \"Still in Love with You\" reached #15 also in 1978. Later hits, from when the band re-grouped in the 1980s, were written by other band members, often working with outside associates: The Hunter brothers, with Todd's partner, Johanna Pigott, wrote \"Rain,\" a #2 hit in 1983, while other, more minor hits were written by the Hunters and/or Alan Mansfield, frequently in collaboration with any combination of Pigott, Mansfield's partner Sharon O'Neill, Marc Hunter's partner Wendy Hunter, or producers Todd Rundgren and David Hirschfelder. The name Dragon came from a consultation of I Ching cards by early band vocalist Graeme Collins. Dragon have endured tragedy, adversity and notoriety, and during the course of the band's earlier career, several members died from drug-related causes. Problems began soon after their arrival in Sydney in late 1975, when all their equipment was stolen. Several months later, in 1976, drummer Neil Storey died of a heroin overdose; Paul Hewson of a drug overdose in 1985 and Marc Hunter of smoking-related oesophageal cancer in 1998. Several members of the group including Hewson and Marc Hunter were heavy heroin users during the band's heyday, and The Stewart Royal Commission (1980\u20131983) which investigated the Mr. Asia drug syndicate obtained evidence that Dragon members were clients. Two members were involved in a serious car crash in 1977, where Paul Hewson's neck was in a brace as well as having a broken arm and Robert Taylor needed plastic surgery, and Hewson also suffered from debilitating scoliosis and arthritis, the pain of which reportedly contributed to his heroin use. The band also undertook a famously disastrous 1978 tour of the USA, supporting Johnny Winter, which ended when Marc Hunter abused the Texan audience as \"faggots\" and the band were pelted off stage, while Winter's band were said to have taken bets about how long it would be before Hunter was shot. On 1 July 2008, the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) recognised Dragon's iconic status when they were inducted into the ARIA Hall of Fame."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Early Man is a heavy metal band from Brooklyn, New York, now based in Los Angeles, California. Guitarist and vocalist Mike Conte began performing under the name \"Early Man\" in the early 2000s, and when drummer Adam Bennati moved to New York in 2003, the two formed the nucleus for the current line-up. Drawing influence from bands such as Black Sabbath, Mercyful Fate, Megadeth, Judas Priest, Kreator, Celtic Frost, and early Metallica, their traditional approach quickly gained the attention of the independent music scene and they released their first EP in early 2005 on Monitor Records. Matador Records quickly signed them and released their debut LP, \"Closing In\", in the fall of the same year. Lead guitarist Pete Macy was added to the band's lineup in 2005. The band has used several bass players over the years and at times will perform without one. The band cut ties with Matador Records and signed with The End Records in 2008. They released \"Beware The Circling Fin\", a 4-song EP on October 14, 2008, and tours with Iced Earth, High On Fire, 3 Inches Of Blood, Toxic Holocaust, Skeletonwitch, and Valient Thorr soon followed. The follow-up to the group's debut album is entitled \"Death Potion\". It was recorded and produced by Jack Endino. \"Death Potion\" was released on July 20, 2010, and the band did a fall tour with Evile and Bonded by Blood. Prior to the tour Mike Conte announced that he had officially cut ties with Adam Bennati. The band is currently using various touring drummers for live shows. In July 2011 it was announced that Mike Conte is the Composer for a new show debuting on the Cartoon Network called Secret Mountain Fort Awesome. Conte is in charge of all of the music for the show which premiered in the fall of 2011.[citation needed]"@en ;

They debuted in 1991 with the eponymous album Fool's Garden (where the band was essentially formed by Freudenthaler and Hinkel with additional musicians), while the proper first album which saw the complete band was Once in a Blue Moon (1993). Two years later Fool's Garden issued their third album Dish of the Day, scoring a European and Asian chart hit with \"Lemon Tree\". The re-issued track peaked at #26 in the UK Singles Chart in August 1996. Go And Ask Peggy For The Principal Thing followed in 1997, along with three albums in 2000, 2003 and 2005. In 2003, three members left the band, and were replaced by Dirk Bl\u00FCmlein (bassist), Claus M\u00FCller (drummer) and Gabriel Holz (second guitarist, who then left the band in 2007), and the name of the band changed to Fools Garden (without the apostrophe). The band has taken the habit of covering rock and roll songs during live performances (The Beatles' \"Ticket to Ride\" or The Who's \"My Generation\"). Fools Garden's interest in British music is such that cover versions of The Beatles's songs \"Cry Baby Cry\" and \"Martha My Dear\" appeared on their studio albums. The band released a greatest hits compilation album in October 2009. The album, High Times, contained fifteen songs including a brand new song, \"High Time\", and some of the well-known hits re-recorded with the new band (\"Lemon Tree\", \"Wild Days\", \"Suzy\"). The album Who Is Jo King? was released in October 2012. In 2015, the band released the album Flashback which consists of cover versions of songs from the 1980s and 1990s (e. g. \u2033Ordinary World\u2033, \"Sailing on the Seven Seas\", \"Enjoy the Silence\" amongst others) as well as a re-recording of their biggest hit, titled \"Lemon Tree (2.0 Version)\" and some own songs."@en ;

The band is distinguished in having three singers and four songwriters, employing traditional and electronic instruments. Their sound is versatile and evades typical music genres falling into blues, indie, alternative, rock, folk, psychedelic and experimental. Their first album, Bring It On, won the Mercury Music Prize in 1998, giving them much media attention in the UK and throughout the world. Later awards came from the NME and Q Magazine along with a Brit Awards nomination. Gomez began their career on Hut records (Virgin) signing in 1997. Just before their third album release In Our Gun Hut records was forced to downsize and on the following record, Split the Difference, Hut records was disbanded by Virgin/EMI Records. The band were so dismayed by the music industry and shocked by huge setbacks they kept experiencing, that they decided to go it alone and asked Virgin Records to let them go in 2004. The following year American label ATO signed the group, releasing their first live album Out West and their most successful record stateside How We Operate and A New Tide. Currently the band members are split between the UK and US with Ian Ball residing in Los Angeles, Olly Peacock in Brooklyn, New York, and Paul Blackburn, Tom Gray and Ben Ottewell in Brighton, England. Ball has released two solo records entitled Who Goes There (2007) and Unfold Yourself (2013). Ball and Peacock worked on the side project Operation Aloha. The experimental project designed by photographer Christopher Wray-McCann brought together 14 of his friends, living in tree houses making songs with whatever they could bring to the island of Maui, Hawaii. Ball, Ottewell, Peacock and Pattison (engineer) created the Final Keep Me Up in 2009. They decided to record an album using only iPhones in the back lounge of the tour bus from Calais to K\u00F6ln 2 May 2009. The album exists only in streaming form. Ben Ottewell has released two solo records entitled Shapes & Shadows (2011) and Rattlebag (2014)."@en ;

The themes of their songs typically include love, friendship and relationships. Since their debut, they have sold more than 8 million albums worldwide. In November 2007, lead singer Amaia Montero announced that she would be leaving the group to begin a solo career. Her replacement, Leire Mart\u00EDnez, was announced in July 2008; the first single featuring the new singer, \"El \u00DAltimo Vals\" (The Last Waltz), was released at the same time. The album from which the single was taken, A las cinco en el Astoria, followed in September 2008. Leire was discovered on the Spanish reality show Factor X."@en ;

Predominantly a power/speed metal band with heavy symphonic elements, they later gravitated towards a progressive sound with an emphasis on ballads. Besides being one of the first Japanese acts to achieve mainstream success while on an independent label, the group is widely credited as one of the pioneers of visual kei, a movement among Japanese musicians comparable to Western glam. Originally named X (\u30A8\u30C3\u30AF\u30B9 Ekkusu), they released their debut album Vanishing Vision (1988) on Yoshiki's own Extasy Records a year after finalizing their line-up including bassist Taiji, lead guitarist hide and rhythm guitarist Pata. They achieved breakthrough success in 1989 with the release of their second and major debut album Blue Blood. Following 1991's Jealousy, Taiji left the band in early 1992. He was replaced by Heath and the group changed their name to X Japan before producing the mini album Art of Life (1993), which is composed solely of the 29-minute title track. In 1995 the group dropped most of its original visual kei aesthetics in favor of a more casual look and released Dahlia (1996), which like their two previous albums debuted at number one. X Japan performed their last concert at the Tokyo Dome on December 31, 1997, making it the last of five consecutive sold-out New Year's Eve concerts the group held at the stadium. After ten years, X Japan reunited in 2007 and recorded the new song \"I.V.\". Over the next two years they performed several concerts, including their first overseas show in Hong Kong, and formally added Sugizo as lead guitarist in place of hide, who died in 1998, before holding a North American tour in 2010. In 2011, the band went on their first world tour throughout Europe, South America and Asia. X Japan has released five studio albums, six live albums, and 21 singles. Three of their albums have consecutively debuted at number one on the Oricon chart. In 2003, HMV Japan ranked the band at number 40 on their list of the 100 most important Japanese pop acts. In 2007, Rolling Stone Japan ranked Blue Blood number 15 on its list of the 100 Greatest Japanese Rock Albums of All Time. It has been reported that X Japan have sold over 30 million records."@en ;

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pennywise_(band)>	rdf:type	dbo:Band ;
	dbo:abstract	"Pennywise is an American punk rock band from Hermosa Beach, California, United States, formed in 1988. The name is derived from the monster, It, from the Stephen King novel of the same title. Between their 1991 self-titled debut and 2005's The Fuse, Pennywise had released an album every two years on Epitaph Records, a label owned by Bad Religion guitarist Brett Gurewitz. To date, the band has released eleven full-length studio albums (the last being 2014's Yesterdays), one live album, two EPs and one DVD. Although their first two studio albums were critically acclaimed, Pennywise would not experience worldwide commercial success until the 1995 release of their third studio album, About Time, which peaked at number ninety-six on the Billboard 200, and number fifty-five on Australia's ARIA Charts. The band's mainstream success was signified by a growing interest in punk rock during the 1990s, along with fellow California bands NOFX, Rancid, Blink-182, Bad Religion, Green Day, The Offspring and Sublime. By 2007, the band had independently sold over 3 million records worldwide, making them one of the most successful independent punk acts of all time. Pennywise's current line-up consists of Jim Lindberg (vocals), Fletcher Dragge (guitars), Randy Bradbury (bass) and Byron McMackin (drums). They had kept their original line-up together until bassist Jason Thirsk died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound in 1996, due to issues with his alcoholism, after which Bradbury joined as his replacement. In August 2009, Lindberg decided to leave the band; he was replaced in February 2010 by Ignite singer Zoli T\u00E9gl\u00E1s. With T\u00E9gl\u00E1s, the band recorded their tenth studio album All or Nothing, which was released on May 1, 2012. Lindberg rejoined the band later that year after T\u00E9gl\u00E1s was sidelined by a back injury."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"The Derek Trucks Band is an American jam band founded by young slide guitar prodigy, Derek Trucks, who began playing guitar and touring with some of blues and rock music's elite when he was just nine years old. After experimenting as an adolescent with musicians he met between tours and recording sessions, Trucks founded The Derek Trucks Band in 1994. With family ties to The Allman Brothers Band, Trucks continued to experiment and play with others, carefully assembling his own band over a period of several years. Loosely based in his family home in Jacksonville, Florida, with Trucks as unquestionable bandleader, the band is made up of six individuals. The band has drawn upon the wide variety of the influences and musical preferences of its band members. Together, they have gained increasing public notice and critical acclaim for developing a unique sound of their own. Melding together blues, southern rock, jazz, rhythm and blues, gospel, soul, funk with Hindustani classical music, afro-beat and world fusion, the band has released nine albums as of 2009. Increasingly, the bandmates have combined their talents to perform pieces from some of the most highly regarded musicians before them, while at the same time collaborating on writing the songs they have recorded. Their sound has become, with maturity, a way for Trucks to explore his own creativity. Rather than focus all his energy into his increasing role as a guest (and eventually, a permanent membership in The Allman Brothers Band) Trucks has nurtured a different eclectic sound as bandleader of what is now The Derek Trucks Band."@en ;

dbr:Van_der_Graaf_Generator	rdf:type	dbo:Band ;
	dbo:abstract	"Van der Graaf Generator are an English progressive rock band, formed in 1967 in Manchester by singer-songwriters Peter Hammill and Chris Judge Smith and the first act signed by Charisma Records. They did not experience much commercial success in the UK, but became popular in Italy during the 1970s. In 2005 the band reformed, and continue to perform as of 2014. The band formed at Manchester University, but settled in London where they signed with Charisma. They went through a number of incarnations in their early years, including a brief split in 1969. When they reformed, they found minor commercial success with The Least We Can Do Is Wave to Each Other, and after the follow-up album, H to He, Who Am the Only One, stabilised around a line-up of Hammill, organist Hugh Banton, saxophonist David Jackson, and drummer Guy Evans. The quartet subsequently achieved significant success in Italy with the release of Pawn Hearts in 1971. After several exhausting tours of Italy, the band split in 1972. They reformed in 1975, releasing Godbluff and frequently touring Italy again, before a major line-up change and a slight rename to Van der Graaf. The band split in 1978. After many years apart, the band finally united at a gig at the Royal Festival Hall and a short tour in 2005. Since then, the band has continued as a trio of Hammill, Banton, and Evans, who record and tour regularly in between Hammill's concurrent solo career. Their most recent album, ALT, was released in June 2012. The group's albums have tended to be both lyrically and musically darker in atmosphere than many of their prog-rock peers (a trait they shared with King Crimson, whose guitarist Robert Fripp guested on two of their albums), and guitar solos were the exception rather than the rule, preferring to use Banton's classically influenced organ, and, until his departure, Jackson's multiple saxophones. While Hammill is the primary songwriter for the band, and its members have contributed to his solo albums, he is keen to stress that the band collectively arranges all its material. Hammill's lyrics frequently covered themes of mortality, due to his love of science fiction writers such as Robert Heinlein and Philip K. Dick, along with his self-confessed warped and obsessive nature. His voice has been a distinctive component of the band throughout its career. It has been described as \"a male Nico\" and would later on be cited as an influence by Goth bands in the 1980s. Though the group have generally been commercially unsuccessful outside of early 1970s Italy, they have inspired several musicians, including John Lydon and Julian Cope."@en ;

The group was initially signed to Pony Canyon and released one studio album and six singles\u2014beginning with their 1999 eponymous debut single before moving to the Johnny's subsidiary label J Storm in 2001, which was initially set up for their succeeding releases.

dbr:Blink-182	rdf:type	dbo:Band ;
	dbo:abstract	"Blink-182 (often stylized as blink-182) is an American rock band formed in Poway, a suburb of San Diego, California in 1992. The band currently consists of bassist and vocalist Mark Hoppus and drummer Travis Barker with guitarist and vocalist Matt Skiba as a touring and session member. Blink-182 is considered a key group in the development of pop punk; the band's combination of pop melodies with fast-paced punk rock featured a more radio-friendly accessibility than prior bands. Founded by Hoppus, guitarist and vocalist Tom DeLonge, and drummer Scott Raynor, the band emerged from the Southern California punk scene of the early 1990s and first gained notoriety for high-energy live shows and irreverent lyrical toilet humor. The band was initially known as Blink until Irish band Blink threatened legal action; the band appended \"-182\". Cheshire Cat (1995) led the band to tour with Pennywise and NOFX on the Warped Tour. Dude Ranch (1997) was co-distributed by major label MCA Records and featured the band's first rock radio hit, \"Dammit (Growing Up)\". Raynor was fired midway through a 1998 tour and replaced by Barker. Enema of the State (1999) was an enormous success on the strength of hit singles \"What's My Age Again?\", \"Adam's Song\" and \"All the Small Things\", which enjoyed massive airplay and became MTV staples. Take Off Your Pants and Jacket (2001) reached number one in the United States, Canada, and Germany. The eponymously titled Blink-182 followed in 2003 and marked a stylistic shift for the group, infusing experimental elements into the group's usual pop punk formula, resulting in a more mature sound. DeLonge left the group in 2005, sending the band into what was termed an \"indefinite hiatus\". The trio reunited in 2009, producing the band's sixth album, Neighborhoods (2011). In 2015, DeLonge again exited, and was replaced by Alkaline Trio guitarist and vocalist Matt Skiba. Blink-182 has sold over twelve million albums in the United States, and over 35 million albums worldwide. In 2011, The New York Times asserted, \"no punk band of the 1990s has been more influential than Blink-182,\" and even as the band receded after its 2005 split, \"its sound and style could be heard in the muscular pop punk of Fall Out Boy or in the current wave of high-gloss Warped Tour punk bands, like All Time Low and The Maine.\""@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Deadweight is an alternative rock trio from San Francisco, California. Members include Ben Barnes (electric violin and vocals), Sam Bass (electric cello) and Paulo Baldi (drums). Deadweight began as a duo of Barnes and Bass who were graduates of San Francisco Conservatory of Music later joined by Baldi. Their first demo (1994) was produced by Jason Newsted of Metallica. Deadweight has toured both nationally and internationally and has opened for Les Claypool's Fearless Flying Frog Brigade. Deadweight's third album, Stroking The Moon (2003), was released on Jello Biafra's Alternative Tentacles label. Playing the violin and cello through a variety of guitar effects, their studio recorded material is surprisingly hard rock. Live performances display an eclecticism that has conjured a variety of descriptions by critics. Examples include, \"(howling) like something out of Beethoven's most twisted hallucinations,\" \"Eastern European Gypsy songs sung in the back of a big rig driven across tornado country by the ghost of the Marlboro Man\" and \"Charlie Daniels in hell playing a combination of Bartok and Zeppelin.\" Barnes has stated both Jimmy Page and Charlie Daniels are influences for their sound. Deadweight were winners of the SF Weekly's 1998 Wammy award for the category of \"Beyond.\""@en ;

Formed in 1997, the band's original line-up consisted of Paul Banks (vocals, rhythm guitar), Daniel Kessler (lead guitar, vocals), Carlos Dengler (bass guitar, keyboards) and Greg Drudy (drums, percussion). Drudy left the band in 2000 and was replaced by Sam Fogarino. In 2010, shortly after recording finished for the band's fourth album, Dengler left to pursue personal projects. Having first performed at Luna Lounge along with other notable bands like The Strokes, Longwave, The National and Stellastarr, they are one of the bands associated with the New York City indie music scene, and was one of several groups that emerged from the post-punk revival of the 2000s. The band's sound is generally a mix of staccato bass and rhythmic, harmonized guitar, with a snare heavy mix, drawing comparisons to post-punk bands such as Joy Division and The Chameleons. Aside from the lyrics, their songwriting method includes all of the band members, rather than relying on any given chief songwriter. The band's debut album Turn on the Bright Lights (2002) was critically acclaimed, making it to tenth position on the NME's list of top albums in 2002 as well as No. 1 on Pitchfork Media's Top 50 Albums of 2002. Subsequent records Antics (2004) and Our Love to Admire (2007) brought them greater critical and commercial success. The band released its fourth, self-titled album on September 7, 2010. The band went on hiatus from 2011 through 2012 while they focused on other projects. Their fifth studio album El Pintor was released on September 9, 2014."@en ;

The band enjoyed commercial success in the UK between 1996 and 1999, notching up a number of Top 10 hits on the UK Singles Chart, including \"Tattva\", \"Hey Dude\", \"Govinda\", \"Hush\", and \"Sound of Drums\". The band's debut album, K, reached No. 1 on the UK Albums Chart. The band are known for their interest in traditional Indian music, culture, and mysticism, with a number of their most famous songs, including \"Tattva\" and \"Govinda\", featuring lyrics written in Sanskrit. The name Kula Shaker was itself inspired by King Kulasekhara, an Indian emperor from the 8th century. In addition, many of the band's songs feature traditional Indian instruments, such as the sitar, tamboura, and tabla, juxtaposed with guitar-heavy, Western rock instrumentation. Kula Shaker disbanded in September 1999 but reformed in 2004 for sessions for the School of Braja compilation album. This led to plans for a full comeback, although the reformation was not widely publicised until the beginning of 2006. The band's third album, Strangefolk, was issued in 2007 and their fourth, Pilgrims Progress, was released in 2010. The band are returning with a European tour and new album in 2016."@en ;

Since then they have released fourteen more albums.They are one of the most influential and most-referenced rock bands of the Latin rock world. The band's sound is a mix of rock, ska, jazz, folk, reggae, funk and big band. It is also noted for its irreverent and humorous lyrics which often contain political undertones. The lineup has changed throughout the years, but the core members have always been the co-founders: singer Gabriel Fernandez Capello (known as Vicentico) and bassist Flavio Cianciarulo (known as Sr. Flavio). Vicentico and Sr. Flavio have done the majority of the songwriting and lyrics as well. Saxist Sergio Rotman, Drummer Fernando Ricciardi and keyboardist Mario Siperman have also been featured in all lineups of the band. The band, which collaborated with some music stars such as Mick Jones, Debbie Harry, Celia Cruz, Rub\u00E9n Blades and Fishbone, received the MTV Latino Video Music Award in 1994 for the single \"El Matador\", in what probably was the peak of popularity of the band. The song made an appearance on the soundtracks for the movies Savages, Grosse Pointe Blank and The Matador. On September 29 of that year they produced an MTV Unplugged concert. The Cadillacs also won the 1998 Grammy Award for Best Latin Rock/Alternative Album, and were nominated in the 2000 Latin Grammy Awards for Best Band and Best Music Video (\"La Vida\"), which received the now-defunct International Viewer's Choice Award (Southern Region) at the 2000 MTV Video Music Awards. On April 7, 2008, the band's front man, Vicentico, announced the band's return from their six year hiatus. According to Vicentico's mySpace, this represented a new phase for the band. On March 10, 2009 they released a new album, La Luz del Ritmo, distributed by Nacional Records in the US. Along with the release, the band toured throughout spring 2009 in Latin America and the United States. Along with the news of their return, Vicentico's mySpace announced that due to Gerardo \"Toto\" Rotblat's recent death, the band had been forced to make changes. The new line-up was as follows: Vicentico (vocals), Flavio Cianciarullo (bass), Sergio Rotman (sax), Daniel Lozano (trumpet), Fernando Ricciardi (drums) and Mario Siperman (keyboards), all of whom are LFC veterans. It was unclear who would play guitar in the new version of the band."@en ;

The project started out as a hobby project for front man Peter T\u00E4gtgren, whose idea was to fuse heavy metal with 1980s-inspired electro-industrial and techno influences. T\u00E4gtgren, who is also the vocalist/guitarist of Hypocrisy and producer of his own The Abyss studios, is the only current member. Pain's self-titled debut was released in 1997, and since then Pain has released six more albums and a DVD. Starting with their second, all of Pain's albums have made the Swedish charts, thanks in large part to hit singles such as \"End of the Line\", \"Shut Your Mouth\", and \"Same Old Song\". In early February 2006, Blabbermouth.net reported that Pain had signed with Roadrunner Records. Currently, Pain is under the Nuclear Blast Records banner. In 2008, Pain was on tour as a supporting performer for the Finnish symphonic power metal band Nightwish. During this tour singer Peter T\u00E4gtgren, drummer David Wallin, and bassist Johan Husgafvel were assaulted by a gang in Leipzig. T\u00E4gtgren received 10 stitches in his face, Wallin suffered a concussion and stitches to his head, and Husgafvel had his nose broken. Pain supported Nightwish on the second half of their Dark Passion Play World Tour, along with Finnish pop rock band Indica, beginning with the first show in London, UK on 11 March 2009. Pain released their seventh album, You Only Live Twice, on 3 June 2011 via Nuclear Blast.

Shine, the band's major-label debut, was released in 2000 with the national singles \"Runaway\" and \"Rebecca\". After two years of delays, the band released their second album with Warner, Save Me, in 2004. The band was dropped from the label that year and picked up by Kirtland Records. An enhanced Save Me is now being distributed through Kirtland with the radio single \"Must Have Been Love\". Former guitarist and vocalist Al Walsh left the band in an amicable split at the end of 2001. Keyboardist and vocalist Jonathan Williams left in 2003 but rejoined the band in late 2005. Both were significant contributors to the band's sound, particularly in the form of backing vocals. The band didn't see another background vocalist until the 2003 addition of keyboardist/guitarist Todd Wright. Longtime bassist John Small left the band in 2004. With Jonathan's return, Todd Wright has left the band. Todd is now finding success as the front man of his own band, Getaway Car, where he's backed by guitarist Matt Miceli and Crix Reardon - while still a part of Pat McGee Band - on bass. Drummer Chris Williams died peacefully in his home October 28, 2006. As of June 2007, the band has severed ties with Kirtland Records and is once again recording independently. As of 2008, Matt \"Chew\" Calvarese has increasingly sat in as the band's new drummer."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Son of Sam is an American horror punk band that is a side project created by Todd Youth in 2000, during his tenure as the guitarist for Danzig. The band's initial line up featured members of Samhain, Danzig, and AFI. Much like its members' other work, Son of Sam plays in the horror punk style, and also infuses metal and deathrock elements into their music. The name of the band was inspired by serial killer David Berkowitz for whom he named himself the Son Of Sam. In 1999, Youth was invited by Glenn Danzig to fill in the guitar position for the Samhain reunion tour, replacing Samhain's original guitarist, Pete \"Damien\" Marshall, who had opted out in order to tour with Iggy Pop. Playing guitar for the Samhain reunion inspired Youth to write an album worth of Samhain influenced music. Youth then contacted Steve Zing and London May (both ex-Samhain members), who were impressed with what Todd had written, and agreed to help him record an album. The project was dubbed \"Son of Sam,\" a nod to the fact that the band was spawned out of the Samhain reunion. Davey Havok, whose band, AFI, had opened for the Samhain reunion tour, was invited to write lyrics and record vocals for the album, since it was well known that Havok was a huge Samhain fan. In a very short amount of time, they recorded an album of 10 tracks called Songs from the Earth and released it on Nitro Records in 2001 . \"To me, doing this record was sort of a tribute to Samhain. Playing guitar for Samhain on the reunion tour was such an honor. I had forgotten how much I love and respect the band,\" Youth stated. The album featured guest guitar and keyboard from Glenn Danzig on the tracks Stray and Songs From The Earth. In December 2007, messages on the Horror High website indicated that a follow up record was being made. Davey Havok did not return on vocals as although he has said numerous times that he would love to make a new Son of Sam album, he is unable to as he is constantly busy with commitments to AFI's record label, Interscope. Todd Youth released a statement saying while Havok would not be doing vocals, he gave the rest of the band his full blessing in seeking a replacement vocalist. Youth enlisted the talents of Chelsea Smiles bandmate Sky Vaughan-Jayne (real name Jonathan Ian Skye Jayne, and in this incarnation, Ian Thorne) to take up Havok's former mantle, and the band signed to Horror High records. The second album \"Into The Night\" was recorded and released in 2008. With the release of the second LP they embarked on a small American tour. They have since ceased activity."@en ;

They reached their commercial peak with 1979's Breakfast in America, which has sold more than 20 million copies. Though their albums were generally far more successful than their singles, Supertramp did enjoy a number of major hits throughout the 1970s and 1980s, including Hodgson's songs \"Give a Little Bit\", \"The Logical Song\", \"Take the Long Way Home\", \"Dreamer\", \"Breakfast in America\", \"It's Raining Again\", and Davies' songs, \"Bloody Well Right\", \"Goodbye Stranger\", and \"Cannonball\".

	dbo:abstract	"Cellador is a power metal band based out of Denver, Colorado. Originally from Omaha, Nebraska, the band was founded in 2003 by Chris Petersen, the band's primary songwriter, as a direct contrast to the overcrowded metalcore and death metal scenes of the American Midwest. The band has had multiple lineup changes since its inception, but is now rounded out by bass player James Pickett, drummer Nick Mccallister, keyboardist Diego Valadez, and guitarist Caleb Delaet. In 2005 the band signed to Metal Blade Records after playing a show with The Black Dahlia Murder. Cellador's debut album Enter Deception was released in 2006. The band recorded the album at Erik Rutan's Mana Studios. In an article from the December 2006 issue of Metal Maniacs magazine, Chris Petersen says he created the band name in reference to a J.R.R. Tolkien essay which stated that the two words have an appealing sound when combined. Petersen also said that the band was originally called \"Apostate\", but the name was later changed to Cellador because he felt it was more fitting for the band. Cellador has toured across the United States, Canada and Mexico with bands such as Trivium, Bullet for My Valentine, All that Remains, Protest the Hero, The Human Abstract, The Sword, Behemoth, and Sonata Arctica. They have also performed at the ProgPower USA festival in Atlanta, Georgia, as well as the LoudPark festival in Japan, among many others. The band went into hiatus in the year 2009 after several members of the \"Enter Deception\" era lineup left the band. In 2011 after 2 years without any updates, the band quietly released 4 demo songs online from their upcoming EP entitled \"Honor Forth.\" Led by guitarist/songwriter Chris Petersen, the band held continuous auditions for the entirety of 2009-2012 and ultimately reformed with bass player James Pickett, drummer Nick Mccallister, keyboardist Diego Valadez, and guitarist Caleb Delaet. Petersen officially took up the lead vocalist position in 2012. In December 2012, the band announced new live shows beginning in 2013. They spent the entirety of the year establishing in the Colorado area, and playing one-off shows as guest openers for Havok, Into Eternity, Helloween, Shining, Vale of Pnath, Amaranthe, and others. In February 2014 the band announced signing with Extreme Management Group, and announced a Spring US tour with thrash bands Hatchet and Diamond Plate. Exmortus filled for several shows on the tour after Diamond Plate pulled out due to travel issues. The band indicated they would release long awaited new material in 2014.[citation needed]"@en ;

Since its inception it has featured Heppner, singer/guitarist Dan Watchorn, singer/drummer Vince Nudo, and bassist Mike Dyball. Priestess were considered one of the most important bands in the early millennial \u201Cretro rock\u201D movement, although they denied intentionally attempting to emulate the sounds of classic rock bands such as Black Sabbath and AC/DC, whom they idolized and to whom they were frequently compared. Priestess was established in the early 2000s after all but one of the members of punk band the Dropouts left the band. The sole remaining member, Heppner, sought new bandmates after changing the group\u2019s sound, and after a name change they released their first album, Hello Master, on independent record label Indica in 2005. Initially only released in Canada, the album was noticed and released by RCA Records internationally the following year, and the single \u201CLay Down\u201D brought the band much success after being included in the popular video game Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock. RCA disliked Prior to the Fire, the result of the group\u2019s attempt at a second album, as the label feared its progressive rock-influenced sound would not be marketable; the band subsequently left the label and the album's serially-delayed 2009 release occurred in Canada on Indica, followed by an international 2010 release on independent label Tee Pee Records. 2012 would have been the year for a new album, but such a release was canceled.

The band distinguished itself in the hardcore scene of the early 1980s through its jangly punk sound and sardonic humor delivered with thick Philadelphia accents. They attracted college radio attention with their 1985 debut album, Big Lizard in My Backyard, and the song \"Bitchin' Camaro\". Extensive touring and further releases helped the band garner an underground following. They enjoyed international success on the strength of \"Punk Rock Girl\", a single from their 1988 Beelzebubba album which entered into MTV rotation. After an ill-fated stint with the major label Hollywood Records, health problems and industry frustrations in the wake of their success led to the group's 1995 breakup. The group reunited in 2008, with Dan Stevens replacing the deceased Schulthise. In 2011, they released The King in Yellow, their first studio album in 16 years.

The group was formed in 1967 by a group of university students and it acquired widespread popularity in Chile for their song Venceremos (We shall win!) which became the anthem of the Popular Unity government of Salvador Allende. At the moment of the September 11, 1973 Chilean coup they were on tour in Europe and were unable to return to their country where their music was proscribed by the ruling military junta. In Europe their music took on a multifarious character, incorporating elements of European baroque and other traditional music forms to their rich and colourful Latin American rhythms - creating a distinctive fusion of modern world music. They are perhaps the best internationally known members of the nueva canci\u00F3n movement. Their name means 'Sun of the Illimani' in Aymara. Illimani is the name of a mountain in the Bolivian Andes.

dbr:Monkey_Majik	rdf:type	dbo:Band ;
	dbo:abstract	"Monkey Majik (stylised as MONKEY MAJIK) is a Japanese-Canadian pop rock band formed in 2000 in Sendai. The band consists of Canadian brothers, Maynard Plant and Blaise Plant, each acting as lead vocalists and guitarists, and two Japanese members: Tax on drums, and Dick on bass. Monkey Majik is signed to Binyl Records, a subsidiary of Avex Records, and are managed by Edwards Entertainment Group. Due to the blend of Eastern and Western pop rock influences, Monkey Majik has often been referred to as a \"hybrid band\". Much of the band's music has been cross-promoted via television programs, commercials, and movies. They were chosen as \u201CGoodwill Ambassadors\u201D for the 80th anniversary of Japanese-Canadian relations. The band rose to mainstream success after the 2006 success of their singles, \"Fly\", and \"Around the World\", off of the album Thank You, eventually reaching the top Oricon charts and collaborating with major Japanese sensations such as m-flo and SEAMO. As of 2012, they have released seven studio albums, four EP's, three physical live albums, three digital live albums, and three compilation albums, and have certified five singles through the Recording Industry Association of Japan. Since the debut of Monkey Majik, Maynard and Blaise have both simultaneously worked solo ventures into the music industry to much acclaim: Maynard with blanc. and Blaise with The Alphabet Project, of which they have each released two studio albums thus far. They received much acclaim across Japan after their assisting hands-on with clean-up and rescue during the aftermath of the 2011 T\u014Dhoku earthquake and tsunami, which was later documented and broadcast by MTV Japan on a TV special surrounding their work. Since then, Monkey Majik has gained the attention of American rapper and musical entrepreneur, will.i.am, during his world travels sponsored by Intel. Blaise and will.i.am performed a special version of the Monkey Majik song, \"Watching You\", live in Sendai during a private event, during which performance, will.i.am incorporated a freestyle rap. As \"Goodwill Ambassadors\", the band often visits and tours throughout Canada, having performed a special acoustic session in Toronto under this title on February 19, 2012., Blaise has also performed special acoustic live sessions at the Ottawa Japanese \"natsu matsuri\", or summer festival. The band, even after mainstream success, is still based in Sendai, located roughly 350 km from Tokyo. This is contrary to the majority of musicians in Japan, who often move to Tokyo after mainstream success."@en ;

dbr:No_Fun_at_All	rdf:type	dbo:Band ;
	dbo:abstract	"No Fun at All (often abbreviated to just NFAA) is a Swedish punk rock band. The band formed in the summer of 1991 in Skinnskatteberg. The group initially consisted of Mikael Danielsson (guitar), Henrik Sunvisson (bass guitar) and Jimmy Olsson (vocals, drums). The name was inspired by a tongue-in-cheek version of The Stooges' song \"No Fun\" as covered by the Sex Pistols, and the name of the band Sick of It All. The group released their albums on the Swedish label Burning Heart Records outside the United States. Within the U.S., No Fun at All's albums were released by Theologian Records and later by Epitaph Records. In 1993, Jimmy Olsson left the band to concentrate on his other band Sober. No Fun at All then recruited three new members in Ingemar Jansson (vocals), Krister Johansson (guitar) and Kjell Ramstedt (drums). In 1999, Sunvisson left No Fun at All. Danielsson switched from guitar to bass guitar and Stefan Neuman, from Tribulation, took up the vacant guitar slot. On November 11, 2001, after ten years together and over 250,000 album sales worldwide, No Fun at All decided to quits. Since 2004, No Fun at All has performed some reunion gigs. At the reunion show at the Groezrock Festival, No Fun at All announced that they would bring out a new album in the fall of 2008 through their own label Beat 'Em Down Records. On April 19, 2012 the Millencolin Festival announced that No Fun At All canceled their show at the festival due to their disbandment . As of May 2013, however, the band is active again and will be touring Australia in November of that year with Boysetsfire, Off with Their Heads and Jughead's Revenge."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"L.A. Guns are an American hard rock band from Los Angeles, California, formed in 1983. As of 2014, the lineup consists of Phil Lewis (lead vocals, rhythm guitar), Steve Riley (drums, percussion, backing vocals), Kenny Kweens (bass guitar, backing vocals), and Michael Grant (lead guitar, backing vocals). The first incarnation of the group was formed by Tracii Guns in 1983, but disbanded in 1984 following its merger with fellow Los Angeles group Hollywood Rose, becoming the first lineup of Guns N' Roses. In 1985, the group was reformed by Guns and singer Paul Black adding Mick Cripps and Nickey Alexander. Black would soon be replaced by former Girl singer Phil Lewis while former Faster Pussycat bassist Kelly Nickels was added to the group. Later, Alexander would be replaced by former W.A.S.P. drummer Steve Riley with this being known as the \"classic lineup\" of L.A. Guns. They achieved moderate chart success in the late 1980s and early 1990s. However, the group went through numerous lineup changes (with Riley being the most consistent member) and failed to regain mainstream attention. The \"classic lineup\" of the group would reunite in 1999 and began recording new material. However, the group continued to change lineups and Guns eventually left to form the hard rock supergroup Brides of Destruction with Nikki Sixx of M\u00F6tley Cr\u00FCe in 2002. L.A. Guns continued without Guns, bringing in guitarist Stacey Blades, however, following his decision to put Brides of Destruction on hiatus in 2006, Guns formed The Tracii Guns Band. The group's lineup consisted of former L.A. Guns members Black, Alexander as well as Jeremy Guns (though the lineup would eventually change), with the group eventually changing their name to L.A. Guns. Both groups continued to record and tour under the L.A. Guns moniker until 2012, when the Tracii Guns led version of the group disbanded. To date, L.A. Guns has released ten studio albums \u2013 L.A. Guns (1988); Cocked & Loaded (1989); Hollywood Vampires (1991); Vicious Circle (1995); American Hardcore (1996); Shrinking Violet (1999); Man in the Moon (2001); Waking the Dead (2002); Tales from the Strip (2005); and Hollywood Forever (2012), two extended plays \u2013 Cuts (1992); Wasted (1998) as well as a number of live and compilation albums."@en ;

Their first song, written when both boys were 11, was called 'Gee This Sounds Good, I Can't Believe We Wrote It'. Their unique name was lifted from the text of a Polish-American's t-shirt that declared \"You Betchadupa I'm Polish\", dupa being the casual Polish word for arse. The band based themselves in London, UK, after spending much of 2004 in Melbourne, Australia. The band have been on hiatus while Liam has undertaken a solo career. It is uncertain if the band will ever reform. Betchadupa has had extensive experience playing with such bands as Queens of the Stone Age, Foo Fighters, Jane's Addiction and ended the year 2001 on a high playing alongside Pearl Jam\u2019s Eddie Vedder at the Neil Finn and Friends concert in Auckland, and being named Top New Act at the prestigious NZ Music Awards as well as becoming the toast of the South By Southwest Music Convention in Austin, Texas in January 2003."@en ;

They reached their peak of popularity with their album The World Is Ours, released in 2000; the videos for singles \"Here Comes The Pain\" and \"If You Ever Leave Me Standing\" were put into heavy rotation by German alternative music channels such as VIVA Zwei. Farmer Boys has obtained a cult following in later years. Their musical style is a blend of Machine Head's groove metal and Paradise Lost's gothic metal; their lyrical matter, however, unusually to the style, often revolves around the darker side of agriculture - bestiality (\"Farm Sweet Farm\"), torture of animals (\"When a Chicken Cries For Love\"), suicide (\"Relieve the Tension)\" and slaughterhouses (\"When Pigs Fly\"). (Their later albums have strayed away from the subject matter.) Matthias Sayer also provided guest vocals for Apocalyptica's single Hope Vol.2. As of June 2007, very little news regarding the band has been forthcoming since the release of The Other Side in 2004. There are concerns amongst the fans that the band has split up, however there has been no formal press release regarding this. In 2008 after four years had passed since the release of The Other Side the group performed a reunion concert in Stuttgart on 22 December. Having been silent since 2008, however, in 2011 the band played a concert at Summer Breeze Open Air, on 20 August in Dinkelsb\u00FChl, Germany.

The band's name idea come from Marcel Jacob who used the following quote: \"...we might be human but in the end, we still being animals\". The main idea was to have a hard rock record with three singers: Leif Sundin (Great King Rat, John Norum, Michael Schenker Group), Jeff Scott Soto (Talisman, ex-Yngwie Malmsteen) and Mats Lev\u00E9n (Krux, At Vance, ex-Yngwie Malmsteen). After some research and testing, they decided to go with one singer, because they also thought it would be easier for the listeners if they only used one, and well they chose Jeff Scott Soto. After that, again Norgren and Jacob were thinking about who could be the best drummer that they should use for that kind of musical project and they chose Tomas Broman (Great King Rat, Electric Boys, Amaze Me, Hughes Turner Project, Glenn Hughes). They released their only record on January 28, 2002 in USA and February 1 in Europe, but by popular demand the record label made a second edition to reach at least three European countries. Also on June 17, 2002, the record label released a 3-track EP called \"Find My Way Home\". In May the band played a couple of shows to support it. Unfortunately, this was not a good moment for the guys owing to some personal, professional and legal problems. Pontus and Marcel had a falling-out and this meant that Pontus was out both of Talisman and Humanimal, then on October 19 of that year, Humanimal split."@en ;

They also had UK Top 10 hits with \"Now Those Days Are Gone\" (1982), \"If You Can't Stand the Heat\" (1982), \"When We Were Young\" (1983) and \"New Beginning (Mamba Seyra)\" (1986). Their worldwide record sales have exceeded 15 million. The line-up of the group has changed a number of times over the years, most famously when Jay Aston quit the group in 1985 and was replaced by Shelley Preston. Today, two versions of the group exist; the official version which includes original member Bobby G and a three-member version who tour under the name Cheryl Baker, Mike Nolan and Jay Aston formerly of Bucks Fizz."@en ;

The music played by Bruce Lee Band spans nearly all subgenres of ska music. Their 2005 release, Beautiful World, showcased a heavily two-tone influenced sound, using exclusively clean guitar and unusual song structure. In contrast, the debut release features more third-wave qualities, and a sound that was very typical of 1995\u2014the year in which it was released. Officially, the band is known as B. Lee Band to avoid legal complications with the estate of the late Bruce Lee. In an interview, Park stated that after the first album had been released under the \"Bruce Lee Band\" name, Lee's brother Robert happened to work in the CD manufacturing plant responsible for pressing the album. Robert Lee contacted Park to give him a friendly word of caution that Mike should probably change the name. They were also briefly known as The Bruce Lee Hartney Band. Their new EP entitled Community Support Group was released January 28, 2014 on Really Records. The new EP introduces a new lineup that includes Jeff Rosenstock, Mike Huguenor, and Keven Higuchi."@en ;

dbr:Gwar	rdf:type	dbo:Band ;
	dbo:abstract	"Gwar, often styled as GWAR, is an American heavy metal band formed in Richmond, Virginia, United States, in 1984, composed of and operated by a frequently rotating line-up of musicians, artists and filmmakers collectively known as Slave Pit Inc. Easily identified by their distinctively grotesque costumes, Gwar's core thematic and visual concept revolves around an elaborate science fiction-themed mythology which portrays the band members as barbaric interplanetary warriors, a narrative which serves as the basis for all of the band's albums, videos, live shows and other media. Rife with over-the-top violent, sexual, and scatological humour typically incorporating social and political satire, Gwar have attracted both acclaim and controversy for their music and stage shows, the latter of which notoriously showcase enactments of graphic violence that result in the audience being sprayed with copious amounts of fake blood. Such stagecraft regularly leads Gwar to be labeled a \"shock rock\" band by the media. Since their formation, Gwar have released thirteen studio albums, two live albums, and numerous singles among other recordings, and have sold over 820,000 records in the United States. Fueled largely by the controversies surrounding their concerts, Gwar experienced brief mainstream notoriety during the first half of the 1990s, receiving regular airplay on MTV as well as frequent in-character guest appearances on daytime talk shows, satirizing the topics of censorship and media violence. Though the band's mainstream popularity declined by the end of the 1990s, Gwar has retained a dedicated cult following. The band's extensive videography consists of both live recordings and long-form feature films, most notably 1992's Phallus in Wonderland, which earned a Grammy Award nomination for Best Long Form Music Video. Outside of music and video, Gwar have expanded their franchise into a now-discontinued line of comic books, trading cards, a cartoon, a board game, signature beers, barbecue sauces, and e-liquids."@en ;

The band has attributed its success in Asia to their clean-living image and to singing in English as a second language. MLTR has earned Gold and Platinum status for records in many countries and won many awards, including the Gold Preis Award from RSH, Germany and \"The Best Performing Act of the Year\" at the SEA Grammy Awards in Singapore. In addition, their song \"Take Me To Your Heart\" was awarded \"most downloaded single of the year 2006\" had 6 million or more paid downloads. The band has recorded eight studio albums as well as a number of live and greatest hits albums. During the peak of their popularity in the mid-1990s, MLTR was described by critics as being \"as good (if not better) a band as any current big name group out of America or the UK.\" According to the band's record label releases, their sound is \"the perfect balance of a Scandinavian glow and the international pop song that has been instrumental in forming the compelling sound of the band\", although the lead singer and songwriter, Jascha Richter, disagrees with this, maintaining that the music defies geographical categorization."@en ;

Their song lyrics often consist of Japanese, English, or just plain gibberish.

Rocket from the Crypt is an American rock band from San Diego, California, originally active from 1989 to 2005, second active during 2011 and again from 2013 to present. The band gained critical praise and the attention of major record labels after the release of their 1992 album Circa: Now!, leading to a recording contract with Interscope Records. They experienced a surge of popularity with the release of the albums Scream, Dracula, Scream! (1995) and RFTC (1998), accompanied by numerous vinyl singles and EPs released on independent labels. However, album sales were not as high as expected and Interscope soon turned their attention to higher-grossing acts. The band left the label, and shortly thereafter drummer Atom Willard departed the group. After a period of inactivity in 1999 and 2000, during which Reis formed Hot Snakes and Sultans and launched his Swami Records label, the band signed to Vagrant Records and recruited new drummer Ruby Mars. They experienced a revitalization of creative energy and released two more albums, but were not as prolific as in the past. Over the next few years the band members became increasingly involved with other projects and Rocket from the Crypt became less the focus. They decided to disband in 2005, playing a sold-out farewell show on Halloween in their hometown of San Diego. The band reunited in 2011 for a one-off appearance on the television program Yo Gabba Gabba!, and in 2013 reformed once more for a series of performances in the US, Europe and Australia."@en ;

dbr:The_Aquabats	rdf:type	dbo:Band ;
	dbo:abstract	"The Aquabats are an American rock band formed in Orange County, California in 1994. Throughout many fluctuations in the group's line-up, singer The MC Bat Commander and bassist Crash McLarson have remained the band's two constant fixtures. Since 2006, The Aquabats' members also include keyboardist Jimmy the Robot, drummer Ricky Fitness and guitarist Eagle \"Bones\" Falconhawk. Easily identified by their masks and matching costumes, The Aquabats are perhaps most recognized for their comedic persona in which they claim to be crime-fighting superheroes. This theme serves as subject for much of the band's music and as part of their theatrical stage shows, which typically feature various stunts and fight scenes with costumed villains and monsters. Musically, The Aquabats have continuously evolved over the course of their career, starting as an eight-member ska band before reinventing themselves in the early 2000s as a new wave-influenced rock quintet. The band's current musical style mixes rock and punk with elements of new wave, ska and synthpop. The Aquabats have released five studio albums, two extended plays and one compilation, among other recordings. From March 2012 to January 2014, the band also created and starred in The Aquabats! Super Show!, a live-action musical action-comedy television series which aired on American cable channel The Hub. The series ran for two seasons, earning six Daytime Emmy Award nominations and ultimately winning one."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Showbread is an American Christian metal band formed in Guyton, Georgia in 1997. The group has gone through numerous lineup changes since its initial formation, but maintains its two core members, Josh Dies and Patrick Porter. The group built an underground fanbase in the late 1990s and early 2000s through word-of-mouth exposure and frequent touring. In 2004, the band signed with Tooth & Nail Records and released their major-label debut, No Sir, Nihilism Is Not Practical. In 2010, the band left Tooth & Nail and joined Come&Live!, an independent record label that releases music via free downloads. Throughout their career, the band has been subject to much controversy among Christian listeners, over their lyrical themes and personal lifestyles. The members of Showbread have labeled their musical sound as \"Raw Rock\". According to former guitarist Matt Davis, the band's name comes from \"a biblical reference that Jesus used to show how Christianity isn't so much about rules but about love.\" Showbread released their final album, Showbread Is Showdead, on January 8, 2016.[better source needed]"@en ;

Founded in Baltimore, Maryland, and active since 1992, Dru Hill recorded seven Top 40 hits, and is best known for the R&B #1 hits \"In My Bed\", \"Never Make a Promise\", and \"How Deep Is Your Love\". Tamir \"Nokio the N-Tity\" Ruffin was the group's founder; his groupmates included lead singer Mark \"Sisq\u00F3\" Andrews, Larry \"Jazz\" Anthony, and James \"Woody Rock\" Green. Signing to Island Records through Haqq Islam's University Records imprint, the group released two successful albums, Dru Hill and Enter the Dru, before separating for a period from late 1999 to 2002, during which time Sisq\u00F3 and Woody released solo albums. While Woody's Soul Music LP was a moderate success in the gospel music industry, Sisq\u00F3's debut album, Unleash the Dragon, and its hit single, \"Thong Song\", were major pop successes, and established Sisq\u00F3 as a household name outside of Dru Hill. Sisq\u00F3's second album, Return of Dragon, did not sell as well. In 2002, by then part of the Def Soul record label, the group reunited and added fifth member Rufus \"Scola\" Waller to the lineup for their third album, Dru World Order, whose underperformance led to the group being dropped from Def Soul. In 2009, the group signed to Kedar Entertainment Group and released their fourth album, InDRUpendence Day, the following year, with new member Tao taking the place of the again departed Woody."@en ;

At the band's commercial peak, the line-up consisted of Martin Metcalfe on vocals, John Duncan on guitar, Fin Wilson on bass guitar, Shirley Manson and Rona Scobie on keyboards and backing vocals, and Derek Kelly on drums. The Mackenzies were a popular local rock group, but were hindered by record company conflicts and inability to gain significant facclaim, record sales or chart positions outside of the U.K. Internationally, they are best known as the group of which Shirley Manson \u2013 the lead singer of alternative rock group Garbage \u2013 was once a member. The band came to prominence in the late 1980s after releasing two independent label singles, and were eventually signed to Capitol Records. After charting in the UK with their debut album, Good Deeds and Dirty Rags, and single release \"The Rattler\" the band failed to break through, and were shifted to a number of different record labels. The band splintered in 1993, leaving Manson, Metcalfe, Wilson and Kelly to form Angelfish to continue recording music. After Manson left for Garbage in 1994, the Mackenzies continued until their final live show at the end of 1995."@en ;

The group was founded by Will Lee, bassist for Late Show with David Letterman, and features Jimmy Vivino, bandleader for Conan. Other members include Rich Pagano, Frank Agnello, and Jack Petruzzelli. The band is committed to performing live what they feel would be an accurate reproduction of The Beatles' repertoire, often performing material The Beatles never played live. The band is often accompanied by a horn section (known as the Hogshead Horns) and a string section (known as the Creme Tangerine Strings) to achieve the proper sound. Their performances in the New York City area have included The Bowery Ballroom, Webster Hall, Nokia Theater, Irving Plaza, the Beacon Theatre, The Bottom Line, and The China Club. Their shows often have themes; one show could feature a track-by-track rendering of The White Album; the next might feature all of the Beatles' psychedelic work; another will include a full survey of the band from its Cavern Club days through to Let It Be. The Fab Faux has also performed a show of post-Beatle solo material. The group was featured in a full-length profile on CNN that was broadcast worldwide. They also participated in a CD of original material by Beatles tribute bands, recorded in London at Abbey Road Studios and engineered and produced by Will Schillinger. The group has performed multiple times in Liverpool, England, where they played three shows each year from 1999 to 2005 for that city's annual \"Beatle Week\" festivities, including outdoor concerts for over 35,000 people on the Yellow Submarine and Let It Be stages.[clarification needed] The band was featured in a full-page story in the August 11, 2005, issue of Rolling Stone magazine (page 22). Senior editor David Fricke wrote: \"The Faux invigorate the artistry of even the Beatles' most intricate studio masterpieces with top chops and Beatlemaniac glee;\" and the story's byline called The Fab Faux \"The greatest Beatles cover band...without the wigs.\" In an on-air interview (and accompanying print article) with National Public Radio's Ashley Kahn in January 2008, members of the band discussed their process of re-creating The Beatles' material for live performance; as well as an account of a brief conversation about the band between Will Lee and Paul McCartney."@en ;

The band makes use of both electronic and traditional instruments, and has sought to use electronics to recreate traditional indie rock song forms and instrumental structures. The group has released two albums on each of the American indie labels Teenbeat Records and Absolutely Kosher, and their track \"All I do\" was prominently featured in the soundtrack for the major film Wicker Park. The group has developed a devoted following in Japan and Taiwan, and has toured there frequently. Although many artists append bonus tracks onto the end of Japanese album releases to discourage purchasers from buying cheaper US import versions, the overseas versions of +/- albums are usually quite different from the US versions - tracklists can be rearranged, artwork with noticeable changes is used, and tracks from the US version can be replaced as well as augmented by bonus tracks."@en ;

Their reception there was so enthusiastic that they were invited back for the 2009 festival, as well as several other UK festivals in the summer of 2009. The band performed at Glastonbury Festival in 2010 and toured the UK in subsequent years. The flavor of the band is best captured by a live concert, or by one of their live recordings. The band is noted for the dedication and support shown by their fans. Some fans travel hundreds of miles to attend concerts. A high point of the year for many fans are the Grand Slambovian Hillbilly Pirate Balls, annual costumed events held in London and New York in the run-up to Halloween."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Ghosts and Vodka was an instrumental math rock band from Chicago The band was made up of two guitarists, Victor Villareal and Sam Zurick, bassist Erik Bocek and drummer Scott Shellhamer. The band formed after Bocek and Zurick met Villareal and Shellhamer at a Sky Corvair reunion show in 1998. Bocek and Zurick were both members of Joan of Arc at the time, but quit when the four formed Ghosts and Vodka (Zurick would return to Joan of Arc several years later). Ghosts and Vodka continued to play until 2001 when Villareal and Zurick opted to concentrate on Owls, which saw them reuniting with their ex-Cap'n Jazz bandmates Mike and Tim Kinsella. In 2003, the Sixgunlover label compiled the group's full anthology onto one CD. In March 2009, the band put a blog up on their Myspace with news of their first practice in 8 years, but later that year announced that they were not continuing in the near future."@en ;

The idea to form a supergroup originated in 2000 on the Tattoo the Earth tour, although plans were constantly put on hold due to scheduling conflicts. The summer of 2006 allowed the band to take the project seriously and record its first album. Recorded at Chasin' Jason studio in Dimebag Darrell's backyard, a self-titled album was completed in roughly one month. Released on April 10, 2007, the album entered the Billboard 200 at number 9, selling 45,000 copies.

	dbo:abstract	"Mexican Pets were formed by Pat Clafferty and Jill Hahn in Dublin, Ireland in 1990 inspired by American bands such as H\u00FCsker D\u00FC and Dinosaur Jr. The two soon drafted Derrick Dalton in on bass whose distinct and accomplished style was an invaluable contribution to the band's sound. The band never featured a permanent drummer and a string of players graced the stool including two guys called Eric, both of them American. Having made several demo recordings and playing extensive gigs around the country, they had their first break up. Each of its members pursued other musical interests until the spring of 1994 when they reformed. In that same year they found a permanent drummer in Fionan O Leary. Jill Hahn then moved to Manchester, replaced by Brian Gough on other guitar and organ. They recorded their first album Nobody's Working Title on Independent Records that summer and continued to play across the country. It was then that Andy Cairns from northern rockers Therapy? released four singles on his label Blunt. Two of these singles featured the songs off the band's first record and 6 brand new songs were quickly penned for the final two. This was also released on CD format under the title \"The Voice of Trucker Youth\". Every one of the four singles was each awarded 'single of the week' by Hot Press. One bizarre event was when they played Whelans in Dublin's city centre. Having seen a poster for the band, the Mexican Ambassador turned up at the gig with his driver and bodyguard curious to see who the Mexican act were. The ambassador watched the gig and came backstage and thanked the band for their performance. So enthralled by the band that he invited them out to the embassy on his retirement where they performed an a cappella version of 'A Gringo like Me', for the ambassador and crowd including the Papal Nuncio to Ireland. In 1995, Derrick Dalton left and was replaced by John Duff. The band began to play their first gigs in London, frequenting the infamous venues in Camden town and it was not long before they came to the attention of the legendary Seymour Stein who came to see them play with The Poster Children and Steelpole Bathtub in London. 1996 saw The Pets tour in Germany and the Netherlands and several return visits to London. In August of that year they recorded their final album Humbucker which featured a tougher guitar driven sound. The record was again funded by Cairns who had become an invaluable patron of the band. Having promoted the record with a series of gigs and a brief tour of England the band called it a day in May 1997 for reasons unknown. In 2006, following discussions between Clafferty, O Leary and Gough, the band was kick started once more. The late Derrick Dalton, who was playing in the band Crumb, was asked if he would pick up his Bass once more. Thankfully he agreed. Derrick was taken from us too early and we extend our sympathies to his family and many friends. The band wish to publicly thank Dave O'Grady for his tireless and challenging work in managing the band. We also wish to say thank you to Dan Oggly and Andy Cairns. Pat Clafferty went on to record an album in his home studio called \"A Prayer to St. Jude\" Original founder Pat continues to write songs and having located to Donegal, he will release a brand new record with all new material, under the Mexican Pets moniker once more."@en ;

Task Force's debut album, New Mic Order was produced by Mark B and features guest appearances from fellow Mud Family member Skinnyman and Mr. Thing of the Scratch Perverts. Task Force's releases have consisted for the most part of vinyl-only EPs and singles. In 2000, Task Force released Voice of the Great Outdoors, which featured Braintax and Jehst, on Braintax's Low Life Records. Task Force started their own label, Music from the Corner in 2001, and released Music from the Corner Volume 1. A darker, more intense series of predominantly self-produced albums followed.[citation needed] Task Force are currently working on Music from the Corner Volume 5. Chester P released his long-awaited solo album From the Ashes in 2008, which was largely a hit with the Task Force fan base, despite receiving a mixed review (3 out of 5) from UK hip-hop magazine, Hip-Hop Connection (as Chester had previously ripped the magazine on MFTC 2). Both Farma G and Louis Slipperz contributed to the album. The first single released from the album was \"Oh No (He Loves A Ho)\" featuring Farma G.

Quik and AMG had worked together some years earlier when Quik (then known as DJ Quik) produced some records that AMG appeared on. When Quik was released from a prison sentence for parole violation, he decided to form the duo with long-time friend AMG. The group's name was chosen by AMG and Quik's manager Greedy Greg, and in their own words refers to their desire to \"fix music\" - \"We're fixing music out here. We're interchanging our LA people. Right now. Where it was all dry before, we're giving them a breath of fresh air that's homegrown\" - Quik. The group signed a singles deal with Interscope Records after their track \"Can U Werk Wit Dat\" received regular airplay on Los Angeles radio, the label going on to release it as a single. It was chosen as number 22 on Vibe's \"44 Best Songs of 2007\". The single became a favorite on LA radio stations and was featured on the HBO TV show Entourage. It also featured on several Billboard charts: #7 on the Bubbling Under Hot 100 Singles chart, #20 on the Hot Rap Tracks chart, #21 on the Rhythmic Top 40 chart, and #74 on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Airplay chart, The group's debut album, Midnight Life, was supposed to be released in 2007, but never received a physical release; It was sold via the MySpace page of the Secret Music Group, with Quik claiming this was an unauthorized, unfinished version of the album, sold by a former business partner who had hacked Quik's MySpace to make the release look official. The duo toured in 2007 as part of the Ball 4 Real Streetball Tour. Their 2008 album Street Masterpiece received some positive reviews."@en ;

In addition to traditional band functions such as recording albums and touring, U\u017E jsme doma have taken on a wide array of ambitious projects outside of simple music performance, including work with theater, film and art.

dbr:The_Action_Design	rdf:type	dbo:Band ;
	dbo:abstract	"The Action Design is a rock band from California (US) which was formed after the breakup of the former punk band Tsunami Bomb. Emily Whitehurst and Matt McKenzie came together to produce a new band, self-described as \"a refreshing mix of the band's punk rock roots infused with hard hitting dance rhythms and catchy bass lines wrought with think memorable vocal hooks\". In January 2011, on their official Facebook page, the band announced its members are currently focusing on other musical projects rather than The Action Design. While the original line-up consisted of McKenzie, Whitehurst and drummer Brett Friesen; Brett was replaced shortly after the release of their first EP at the end of 2006. Taking over drumming duties would be Jake Krohn, formerly of The Rum Diary; also added to The Action Design crew would be Jaycen McKissick, formerly of Pipedown, on guitar. With the addition of Krohn and McKissick, tAD would complete their lineup. In order to begin touring and playing shows as soon as possible, they enlisted Bobby from the band Kiev to fill in on keyboards for their first tour as a band on the 2007 Warped Tour. The band later began playing their set as a foursome without Bobby who returned to his work with his band. Each band member began pulling double duty; picking up the keyboard parts on their respective instruments.tAD released a limited edition EP with only 1000 pressings in the fall of 2006 and quickly sold out without having played a single show. This version of the EP was recorded when the band was still a three piece and did not feature much guitar work (if any on most of the recordings). It also contained the song \"Move On\" which was later omitted from the PopSmear released version of the E.P. \"Into A Sound\". This original pressing was completely self-published, with all of the artwork hand-printed and numbered by the band. Almost eight months later came the new EP, with a new added cover and insert art. Along with the change in visual appearance, the EP contained two new songs written with new drummer Jake Krohn and added guitar work by Jaycen McKissick to the previously recorded songs.Drums on tracks 1,3,4,6 by Brett Friesen. After the September 11, 2007 release of \"Into A Sound\", the band embarked on their first full coast to coast US tour; booked completely on their own without an agent. After the tour came to an end in December 2007, the band returned to San Francisco where they began making plans for 2008; which include a new release, extensive touring and a new video for the song \"Connect/Disconnect\", directed by music video director Djay Brawner. A new album, Never Say, was released on September 23, 2008. The Action Design's first vinyl release, Desperation, was officially released July 14, 2010. They first started selling it at their summer tour shows and then online at the official store. Its tracklist consists of the title track, the long-awaited \"Desperation\", along with the b-side \"Still Standing.\" Only 500 copies were pressed, 350 copies were taken on tour for the merch table and the 150 left were put up on the official store. Each copy came with its own download card, so you could have digital copies as well. Each vinyl was completely hand-decorated and hand-numbered by the band. The covers are screen printed, spray painted, stickered and markered. Each 100 copies of the vinyl were written with a different color so you could collect all 5."@en ;

The Luttenbachers have created a large body of work focusing on an agenda of musical extremity and dissonance. Over the course of the band, the personnel has shifted numerous times around the artistic leadership of Walter, each line-up revealing a different part of the Flying Luttenbachers' aesthetic. The music has run a gamut from intense, all-acoustic free improvisation, to complex, modernistic rock composition; pure electronic noise to primitive punk-inspired jazz. The music defies idiomatic clich\u00E9 and is steadfastly abstract, choosing to work outside of pre-existing genres in order to attain an original fusion. Walter has been quoted as drawing inspiration from the fields of hardcore punk, black metal, progressive rock, free jazz, no wave, electronic noise, contemporary classical, Balinese gamelan and Noh music."@en ;

The Grape Prophet (1993) was the first of rock operas by Knott. Released in 1993, the fifth album was Cash In Chaos: World Tour. At this point Knott announced that he was changing the name of LSU to 'Cash in Chaos' (henced the mixed band name for this release). 1994's Grace Shaker was followed in 1998 by Dogfish Jones, another rock opera. Despite inactivity from the LSU moniker in recent years, Knott announced in August 2008 that he has recorded a new album with Josh Lory, Jim Chaffin from the Crucified, Matt Biggers, Daniel Sonner and others."@en ;

Camero never left the band, but rather moved to the drums when drummer Pat Pedraza left the band to join alternative rock band From Satellite. Their first album, Cynical, was distributed by Edge Records. Their second album, Scarred, is a collection of unreleased demos and remixes also released by Edge Records. No Motiv subsequently left Edge for unspecified reasons. The band is known for rarely, if ever, playing songs from these two albums at their live shows. The band signed to Vagrant Records and had its greatest success with the 2004 release Daylight Breaking, which reached No. 36 on Billboard's Top Independent albums chart. During the past few years, No Motiv has played only a handful of live shows. While the band has never released an official statement announcing their breakup, they're considered to be on hiatus and inactive at the present time. Jeremy and Jeff reside in Ventura, CA, and started recording material under a new band called Monster Hand. The band never really got off the ground, resulting in Palaszewski starting a solo project entitled \"Sea Greens\" and Hershey assembling his soul powerhouse \"Jeff Hershey and The Heartbeats\". Max lives in Brooklyn, NY and has been recording material under the solo moniker Gentlemen. Roger resides in Irvine, CA, plays bass for Peace'd Out, and writes songs for fun under the name He Fails Me. All band members remain close friends to this day, and also are involved in many side projects in addition to the ones mentioned above, such as Hybrid Moments, Death Country Blues, and Machines."@en ;

They were managed by band manager Tim Byrne, who also formed Steps. Marazzi left the band in 2002, citing personal reasons. The three remaining members subsequently decided to take a break due to exhaustion from being on the road for the best part of four years straight. In December 2009, Ingebrigtsen, Read and Adams reformed A1, without Marazzi, in Norway for a series of concerts at the Christiania Theatre in Oslo.

Originally consisting of members Gerhard Behles and Robert Henke, Monolake is now perpetuated by Henke while Behles focuses on running music software company Ableton, which they founded in 1999 together with Bernd Roggendorf. In fall 2004, Torsten Pr\u00F6frock became a member of Monolake. Monolake's minimal, dub-influenced techno music helped establish the sound of the Chain Reaction label, also located in Berlin, subsequently using their own [ml/i] (Monolake / Imbalance Computer Music) label for the group's output. Both current members have solo projects, with Henke releasing under his own name and Pr\u00F6frock as \"T++\" and \"Various Artists.\" In 2008 T++ followed Ricardo Villalobos in bridging the gap between minimal techno and dubstep, by remixing Shackleton's Death Is Not Final for the Skull Disco label. In 2009, Robert Henke appeared in the electronic music documentary Speaking In Code which presented the completion of the Monodeck. As of 2012, Henke has been designing a new form of live show syncing surround-sound audio stems with visual loops, allowing for improvisation. Monolake is named after Mono Lake, which is east of the Sierra Nevada in California."@en ;

The band's sound is a mixture of hard rock and melodic pop music, often described in the music press as combining influences as diverse as The Beatles and 1980s-era Metallica. However, this characterization is denied by the band, who see their influences as being far broader, as shown in the song \"29 X The Pain\", which lists many of group leader Ginger's influences. Despite several top 20 singles and one top 10 album in Britain, the Wildhearts have not achieved major commercial success, owing in part to difficulties with record companies and many internal problems often relating to recreational drugs and depression. Much of the band's early career was affected by bitter feuds with their record company, East West. In the band's turbulent and unpredictable history, band members have regularly been replaced, with the only constant member being the band's founder Ginger (birth name David Walls) - the singer, guitarist, and predominant songwriter. Several band members have appeared in the line-up more than once. The band has also been split up or placed on hiatus by Ginger multiple times. The most recent recording line-up convened in 2006 but went on hiatus in late 2010. Ginger reformed the band once again for a special one-time appearance in December 2012, which has been extended to touring in 2013 and 2014."@en ;

Initially an indie rock band, the group rose to prominence in the 2000s as part of the post-Britpop movement. The group was founded at the University of Dundee in 1993 by Lightbody, Michael Morrison, and Mark McClelland as Shrug. After briefly using the name Polar Bear and losing Morrison as a member, the band became Snow Patrol in 1997 and added Quinn to its line-up. Their first three records, the EP Starfighter Pilot (1997), and the studio albums Songs for Polarbears (1998) and When It's All Over We Still Have to Clear Up (2001), were commercially unsuccessful and were released by the independent labels Electric Honey and Jeepster. The band signed on to the major record label Polydor Records in 2002. Connolly joined Snow Patrol in 2002, and after their major label debut, Final Straw, the following year, the group rose to national fame. The album was certified 5\u00D7 platinum in the UK and eventually sold over 3 million copies worldwide. Their next studio album, Eyes Open (2006), and its hit single, \"Chasing Cars\", propelled the band to greater international fame. The album topped the UK Albums Chart and was the best-selling British album of the year, selling over 6 million copies worldwide. In 2008, the band released their fifth studio album, A Hundred Million Suns; then, in 2009, they released their first compilation album, Up to Now; and, in 2011, released their sixth studio album, Fallen Empires. During the course of their career, Snow Patrol have won seven Meteor Ireland Music Awards and have been nominated for six Brit Awards.

dbr:Anything_Box	rdf:type	dbo:Band ;
	dbo:abstract	"Anything Box is an electronic/synthpop musical group originally from Paterson, New Jersey and now based in Orange County, California. Formed in 1986, they are best known for their 1989 single \"Living in Oblivion\". The band is one of the primary bands which carried electronic music's transition from the late 1980s into the 1990s and beyond. With a current lineup consisting of Claude Strilio, Dania Morales and Paul Rijnders, the past members have included Carlos Pacheco, Mike Zacek, Gary Strilio, Dave South and Barry Bunch. The band is noted for its melodic, synth-driven dance beats from its early years as well as its fusion of electronics and guitars which is its current musical focus. The band's songs, lyrics, as well as Claude's vocals have been widely regarded in the electronic music community as some of the finest. The band also receives praise for its album artwork which ranges from oil paintings to electronic paintings which are all works of Claude Strilio. Anything Box, (also known as Abox by its loyal fan-base), has released several albums, EPs and singles and continues to perform their energetic live shows around the world. The band's name comes from the title of a book of short stories by Zenna Henderson, The Anything Box. In the title story, a young girl imagines the world as she would have it, apparently by staring at an empty space between her hands. Her school teacher discovers that the box is invisible, but real. Anything Box's most recent release is The Future Past EP (Endpop, June 2007) which features a remake and remixes of their 1990 fan-favorite \"Carmen\" as well as a Spanish version of the song. This marks the first time Anything Box has released a song in Spanish, which has often been requested by their fans."@en ;

KMFDM has released nineteen studio albums and two dozen singles, with sales of more than two million records worldwide. The band has undergone many line-up changes and featured dozens of guest musicians. Its earliest incarnation included German drummer En Esch and British vocalist Raymond Watts, the latter of whom left and rejoined the group several times over its history. German guitarist G\u00FCnter Schulz joined in 1990; both he and Esch continued with the band until KMFDM broke up in 1999. Konietzko resurrected KMFDM in 2002 (Esch and Schulz declined to rejoin), and by 2005 he had assembled a consistent line-up that included American singer Lucia Cifarelli, British guitarists Jules Hodgson and Steve White, and British drummer Andy Selway. Critics consider KMFDM to be one of the first bands to bring industrial music to mainstream audiences, though Konietzko refers to the band's music as \"The Ultra-Heavy Beat\". The band incorporates heavy metal guitar riffs, electronic music, samples, and both male and female vocals in its music, which encompasses a variety of styles. KMFDM normally tours at least once after every major release, and band members are known for their accessibility to and interaction with fans, both online and at concerts. Members, singly or working with each other and others, have recorded under many other names, primarily Watts' Pig in 1988, Konietzko's Excessive Force in 1991, and Esch and Schulz's Slick Idiot in 2001."@en ;

The concept came about when Sinise requested for permission to bring musicians along during his USO tours. The group was initially known as \"Gary Sinise and the Lt. Dan Band\". The Lt. Dan Band has grown from the occasional jam session and Chicago-area gigs to performing for charities and non-profit organizations including the USO and Operation Iraqi Children, the latter of which was co-founded by Sinise in March 2004. They frequently visit military bases in the United States and abroad.

dbr:Won_James_Won	rdf:type	dbo:Band ;
	dbo:abstract	"Won James Won is a noise rock/experimental band based in Saint-Petersburg and Moscow, Russia. They formed in February 2003 and are signed to R.A.I.G. (Russian Association of Independent Genres) label. Members of the band also play in nationally acclaimed professional hardcore bands Kirpichi and I.F.K. Won James Won musical approach combines noisy rock-instrumentations, sampled electronics, wild vocalizations, ambiguous texts and eccentric shows. The group released their debut LP Tol's Toy in 2004 and the second studio album Theorist Attack in 2006. Both albums represent the wild array of styles and sonic methods. In 2005 they released a live auto-bootleg \"The Drisneyland Chronicles Vol.I\". In Spring 2007 the core band members composed an ambient soundtrack \"Dante. Moscow\" for a photo installation based on Dante\u2019s \u201CDivine Comedy\u201D (released as a digital file in 2008). In November 2007 the third official album for RAIG entitled \"The Hollow Grail\" came out. It consisted of live material and marked the return to more abrasive noise imrov direction. Next came \"The Flood of Ixtlan\" EP, 30-minute amalgamation of different styles, from IDM to micronoise and freak-folk. A year later, a collection of studio outtakes, live cuts and other rarities, \"Les 120 Minuetes de Sadomasonodoraemonocuporamenosodom\" was also made available for download on RAIG affiliated net-label Accessory Takes. While this record included mostly song-oriented tracks in noise-rock vein, next studio album by Won James Won entitled \"Corpus Unhearmeticum\" operates in collage, musique concr\u00E8te and dark ambient aesthetics. Artwork for the strictly limited edition of this CD courtesy of ZonderZond is especially ambitious. In 2011 the band delved deeper into field recordings/plunderphonics territory with self-released \"Homeostat EP\". Sounds incorporated in this work were sampled in variety of abandoned factories and wild forests in rural Russia. Next EP was called \"\u0413\u0415\u041D\u0428\u0422\u0410\u0411 \u0414\u0415\u0421\u0411\u041E\u0422\" - a grim-sounding foray into dark ambient electronics. The latest full-length studio album by Won James Won, \"\u0412\u043E\u0438\u043D\u044F \u0412\u0435\u0437\u0443\u043C\u0438\u044F\" is decidedly melodical and song-structured but still as off-kilter as anything in the band's discography. Won James Won are members of ZveZdaZ art-movement. The band is considered as one of the most prolific on Russian underground scene. Their albums were distributed by such well-known underground labels as Cold Spring (U.K.), Amanita (France) and Crucial Blast (US)."@en ;

The group's fame spread with their second album, The Trinity Session, recorded in 1987 at Toronto's Church of the Holy Trinity. Their sound, again using the ambisonic microphone, and their mix of blues, country, folk, rock and jazz earned them both critical attention and a cult following. The Los Angeles Times named the recording as one of the ten best albums of 1988. The band was nominated for Group of the Year at the Juno Awards in 1990 and 1991. In the early 1990s Margo Timmins was named \"one of the fifty most beautiful people in the world\" by People Magazine.

The line-up consists of singers and guitarists Vincent and Daniel Cavanagh, their brother Jamie Cavanagh at bass, siblings John and Lee Douglas, respectively drummer and singer, and keyboardist Daniel Cardoso since November 2012. The band was founded as Pagan Angel in 1990 by the three Cavanagh brothers, John, and singer Darren White, as a death/doom band. At the time White was the only singer of the band. The following year, Jamie left and was replaced by Duncan Patterson. Under this line-up, Anathema released their first EP, The Crestfallen (1992), and their first album, Serenades (1993). However, White left in 1995; Vincent decided to act as Anathema's vocalist in addition to his guitarist function in the albums The Silent Enigma (1995) and Eternity (1996), which were going into a more gothic metal direction. In 1997, John left the band, and was replaced by Shaun Steels for the album Alternative 4 (1998). Both Patterson and Steels left the same year, replaced by Dave Pybus and a returning John Douglas, while former My Dying Bride keyboardist and violinist Martin Powell also joined the band (Daniel Cavanagh was also acting as the band's only keyboardist, and shared this position since). The only album released with this line-up was Judgement (1999): the same year Powell switched positions with Cradle of Filth's keyboardist Les Smith who joined Anathema, and Lee Douglas, John's sister, was added to the line-up as a backing and occasional lead vocalist. The band released their sixth album A Fine Day to Exit in 2001, turning to an alternative sound. Shortly after the release, Pybus announced his departure and was replaced by the band's original bassist, Jamie Cavanagh, reuniting the three brothers in the band for the first time since 1991. There were no new members for the next ten years, with the albums A Natural Disaster (2003) and We're Here Because We're Here (2010) all being recorded and released by the same line-up, with the sound turning even more towards progressive rock; however, Daniel Cavanagh left Anathema in 2002 to join Antimatter, returning in 2003. Smith left Anathema in 2011, and Vincent and Daniel both assumed the function of keyboardist for the band's ninth album, Weather Systems, in 2012. The same year, Cardoso, the band's live keyboardist since 2011, joined as a full-time member. The band's tenth studio album called Distant Satellites was released on 9 June 2014 via Kscope."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Finntroll is a folk metal band from Helsinki, Finland. They combine elements of black metal and folk metal. Finntroll's lyrics are mostly in Swedish, the only exception being the song \"Madon Laulu\" on Visor Om Slutet. Finntroll's original singer, Katla, decided to use Swedish over Finnish since he was part of a Swedish-speaking minority in Finland and the sound of the language seemed to better suit the band's \"trollish\" outfit. Despite several vocalist changes, this tradition has continued. According to bandmembers Vreth and Skrymer, they took their name from an old Finnish legend where Swedish priests coming to Finland had an encounter with a wild-looking man who killed most of their party. The survivors came back bearing the tale of the Finn-Troll. Finntroll's lyrics mainly deal with legends and tales revolving around the fictional Troll-King \"Rivfader\" and the trolls fighting against the Christians who entered their lands and spread their beliefs. A recurring theme is the story of two priests named \"Aamund\" and \"Kettil\". The first three full-length albums feature a rather short but fierce song about the two men who constantly get themselves into trouble with the trolls, only to get beaten up and mutilated over and over again by the wrathful followers of Rivfader. To date, the band's discography includes six full-length albums, a live album and two EPs. Their newest studio album Blodsvept was released on March 22, 2013. In 2014, the band released the live album Natten Med De Levande Finntroll (\"Night of the Living Finntroll\")."@en ;

Their eponymous debut album was released in 1984, and their latest, XI, is due for release in 2016. The band is credited as a formative influence on the thrash metal subgenre, melding the aesthetics of the New Wave of British Heavy Metal and American hard rock with \"incredibly tight musicianship\" and \"piercingly screeched\" vocals. Early lyrical topics such as conflict and paranoia later expanded into philosophical and social commentary. Founding guitarist Kurdt Vanderhoof remained the group's sole consistent creative force throughout its career, despite reducing his role strictly to composition in 1986 after tiring of performing. Vanderhoof, vocalist David Wayne, guitarist Craig Wells, bassist Duke Erickson, and drummer Kirk Arrington composed the group's classic lineup featured on its first two records, while vocalist Mike Howe and guitarist John Marshall later contributed to the group's sound. After releasing five full-length albums and touring extensively throughout the 1980s and early 1990s, Metal Church disbanded in 1994. They reformed four years later with their classic lineup, including Vanderhoof's return to performance, yielding the Masterpeace album. They endured numerous lineup changes thereafter, releasing three further studio albums while fronted by Ronny Munroe before again disbanding in July 2009. The group once again reunited in October 2012 and released Generation Nothing a year later. Following Munroe's departure in the fall of 2014, Howe rejoined Metal Church in April 2015 at Vanderhoof's request, and recorded their upcoming eleventh studio album XI."@en ;

Approximately more than half of the singles and a half of the albums have reached the top of the Japanese Oricon music charts. In recent years, the interval between the band's single CD releases has become longer, and they are now released approximately once a year. The members of SMAP have also pursued careers outside of music, including involvement in television variety shows, dramas, commercials, and movies, making them one of the most popular Johnny's groups. Largely due to their popularity, Johnny & Associates became the most successful agency in Japan, with earnings of almost three billion Japanese yen in 1995."@en ;

Graham Nash left the group in 1968 to form the supergroup Crosby, Stills & Nash. They enjoyed considerable popularity in many countries (at least 60 singles or EPs and 26 albums charting somewhere in the world spanning over five decades), although they did not achieve major US chart success until 1966 with \"Bus Stop\". The Hollies had over 30 charting singles on the UK Singles Chart, and 22 on the Billboard Hot 100, with major hits on both sides of the Atlantic that included \"Just One Look\", \"Look Through Any Window\", \"Bus Stop\", \"I Can't Let Go\", \"On a Carousel\", \"Stop Stop Stop\", \"Carrie Anne\", \"Jennifer Eccles\", and later \"He Ain't Heavy, He's My Brother\", \"Long Cool Woman in a Black Dress\" and \"The Air That I Breathe\". They are one of the few British pop groups of the early 1960s, along with The Rolling Stones, that have never broken up and continue to record and perform.

The Teen Idles were among the first punk rock groups from the early 1980s hardcore movement to break out of their regional scene to tour and sell nationally. Inspired by other American punk bands like the Cramps and Bad Brains, the Teen Idles' music was an early version of hardcore punk, and an attempt, in the words of MacKaye, \"to get away from a really corrupted music.\" Their appearances, lyrics and musical style sought to revive a punk movement that they believed had lost its original zeal."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Tav Falco's Panther Burns, sometimes shortened to (The) Panther Burns, is a rock band originally from Memphis, Tennessee, United States, led by Tav Falco. They are best known for having been part of a set of bands emerging in the late 1970s and early 1980s who helped nationally popularize the blending of blues, country, and other American traditional music styles with rock music among groups playing in alternative music and punk music venues of the time. The earliest and most renowned of these groups to imbue these styles with expressionist theatricality and primitive spontaneity were The Cramps, largely influenced by rockabilly music. Forming just after them in 1979, Panther Burns drew on obscure country blues music, Antonin Artaud's works like The Theater and Its Double, beat poetry, and Marshall McLuhan's media theories for their early inspiration. Alongside groups like The Cramps and The Gun Club, Panther Burns ranked among the contributing influences and progenitors of the Southern Gothic-tinged roots music revival scene that arose during the last two decades of the 20th century and continued into the early 2000s. Artists who have referenced Panther Burns as one of their influences include the American alternative music artists Southern Culture on the Skids, Jon Spencer Blues Explosion, Jack Oblivian, the Royal Pendletons, and The Gories. In Europe, neo-psychedelic groups who have cited the Panther Burns as an influence include England's Spacemen 3; Scotland's Primal Scream; Germany's Cuban Rebel Girls (named after one of Falco's original songs); France's The Dum Dum Boys; and Italy's Time Machine. For Panther Burns' own professed influences, the list is lengthy, from The Cramps to Bix Beiderbecke, Jessie Mae Hemphill, The Sonics, Mack Rice, Chuck Berry, Phineas Newborn Jr., Calvin Newborn, Frank Sinatra, Booker T. and the M.G.'s, Einst\u00FCrzende Neubauten, the Johnny Burnette Rock and Roll Trio, Brian Eno, Marlene Dietrich, Bessie Smith, Ma Rainey, Xavier Cugat, Junior Kimbrough, Laura Dukes, Mud Boy and the Neutrons, Chris Spedding, Jimmy Reed, The Nightcrawlers, the Velvet Underground, Junior Parker, Othar Turner, Charlie Feathers, Howling Wolf, Mose Vinson, Van Zula Hunt, Cordell Jackson, Ronnie Hawkins, the Ventures, Scotty Moore, Elvis Presley, Skip James, Pat Hare, The Doors, R. L. Burnside, Karlheinz Stockhausen, John Fahey, Joe Meek, Bobby \"Blue\" Bland, Gene Pitney, and Elmore James, among many others Falco has listed over the years. After forming Tav Falco's Panther Burns and making their first recordings in Memphis, the group soon evolved as a rotating crew of additional musicians hailing mostly from Memphis, New York, and New Orleans. In the early 1990s, Falco moved to Vienna and later, Paris; at that time he began working more with European musicians. He currently resides in Vienna."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"The Great Kat is the stage name of Katherine Thomas (born 6 June 1966), an English-born, New York-raised, musician best known for her thrash metal interpretations of well-known pieces of classical music. Most feature her using the electric guitar, but some have her on violin. Thomas is a classically trained violinist, graduating from the Juilliard School and touring for a time playing conventional classical music before crossing over to metal. Guitar One magazine listed her as one of the \"Fastest Shredders of All Time\". Her classical background, technical skills and self-promotion are sometimes compared to Yngwie Malmsteen. In an interview in metallian.com she claimed to be the reincarnation of Beethoven. Her public persona, as portrayed in her publicity photos and videos, is mainly compared to that of a dominatrix, albeit in an over-the-top, abusive tongue-in-cheek manner.[neutrality is disputed]"@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"The Jackson 5, or Jackson Five\u2014and The Jacksons in later years, is an American popular music group. Formed in 1964 under the name the Jackson Brothers, the founding members were Jackie, Tito and Jermaine. Marlon and Michael would later join. After participating in talent shows and the chitlin' circuit, they entered the professional music scene in 1967, signing with Steeltown Records, and releasing two singles. In 1969, they left Steeltown Records in order to sign with Motown. The Jackson 5 is one of the first groups of black American performers to attain a crossover following, preceded by the Supremes, the Four Tops and the Temptations. Scoring 17 top forty singles on the Hot 100, after continuing with further hits such as \"Never Can Say Goodbye\" and \"Dancing Machine\", most of the group with the exception of Jermaine, left Motown for Epic Records in 1975, where, with brother Randy taking Jermaine's place, they released five albums between 1976 and 1981, including the hit albums, Destiny (1978) and Triumph (1980) and the hit singles, \"Enjoy Yourself\", \"Shake Your Body (Down to the Ground)\" and \"Can You Feel It.\" In 1983, Jermaine reunited with the band to perform on Motown 25: Yesterday, Today, Forever and subsequently released the Victory album the following year. After the end of their tour to promote the album, Michael Jackson and Marlon Jackson promptly left the group. The remaining four released the poorly received 2300 Jackson Street album in 1989 before being dropped from their label. Inducted to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1997 and the Vocal Group Hall of Fame in 1999, the Jacksons reunited in 2001 on Michael's 30th anniversary television special. Following the death of Michael Jackson in 2009, the four eldest of the brothers embarked on their Unity Tour in 2012."@en ;

dbr:The_Greencards	rdf:type	dbo:Band ;
	dbo:abstract	"The Greencards are a progressive bluegrass band that formed in Austin, Texas, and are currently based in Nashville, Tennessee. The band was founded in 2003 in Texas by Eamon McLoughlin, an Englishman, and Australians Kym Warner and Carol Young. The musicians originally performed in local Austin bars, and soon found increasing acclaim. They have released one independent album, Movin' On, in 2003, and two albums, Weather and Water, and Viridian, on the Dualtone record label. Their fourth album, Fascination, was released on Sugar Hill in 2009. Their fifth album, \"Brick\", 2011, was self-produced with the direct support of their fans. Pre-production donors were recognized with their names inscribed on the \"bricks\" that make-up the cover art. Their debut album, Movin' On, was the recipient of local Texas awards and charted on Americana radio stations. Country Music Television named their follow-up Weather and Water as one of the ten best bluegrass albums of 2005, and The Greencards were invited to tour with Bob Dylan and Willie Nelson in the same year. Viridian would go on to take the number one position on the Billboard magazine's Bluegrass Music Chart, making The Greencards the first international band to ever do so. Viridian was a critically praised album, and was nominated for Best Country Album by the Australian Recording Industry Association. The track \"Mucky the Duck\" from Viridian was nominated for a Grammy Award at the 50th Grammy Awards. The Greencards are noted for their playing of American bluegrass with a worldly feel, and for their incorporation of other genres of music. Often labeled as part of, and said to be representative of, the \"newgrass\" movement, they draw from Irish folk music, gypsy music, rock 'n' roll, folk balladry, and Latin American musical sources. The Greencards' sound has been compared to progressive American folk rock, and they have been credited with helping to expand bluegrass music. Eamon McLoughlin left the band in December 2009, and currently resides in Nashville TN. Carl Miner, originally from Oregon, joined the group in May 2010, playing acoustic guitar. Carl won the 1999 National Flatpicking Championship at the Walnut Valley Festival, and currently resides in Nashville, TN."@en ;

Although the three are not related, the name was chosen in tribute to The Andrews Sisters.The three met in the same Music College, but their r\u00E9sum\u00E9s were very different: Kate (the blonde) had sung in the heavy metal band Killed In Action; Marcella (the brunette) had recorded the dance hit Revolution after serving time in a punk group; as for Rosanna, and later Stephanie, they both came from a classical background. After eight years with the group, O'Brien was replaced by Emma Smith, who comes from a London Jazz dynasty, and is a Royal Academy of Music graduate with a soulful voice and a very cheeky personality. Marcella had had a career in fashion (she had graduated from Central St Martins College of Art and worked with Vivienne Westwood before embarking on a Music degree), so the trio\u2019s first appearances were (almost naturally) \u00E0 la mode. But their gigs quickly became a unique rendezvous for a mix of impassioned fans: jazz-goers, retro-aesthetes, people into nostalgia, others with a style obsession, and also kids, spellbound by the vivacity and colour which sparkled in the Sisters\u2019 voices\u2026 The trio are backed by a three-piece band featuring Blake Wilner on guitar, Henrik Jensen on double bass and Peter Ibbetson on drums. Critic Arion Berger described them as part of \"Retro's futuristic vanguard\" and characterised their sound as \"swing-punk\"[citation needed]. The group is associated with a burlesque revival."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"The Flowers, (Russian: \u0426\u0432\u0435\u0442\u044B, \"flowers\") is a Soviet and Russian rock band that, according to the Itogi magazine, \"started all Russian alternative culture\". It was one of the first bands to introduce rock music to the Soviet show business. The Flowers were established in 1969 by guitar player and song writer Stas Namin. In 1973 The Flowers released flexis with producing company Melodiya; overall seven million copies were sold. After becoming a major hit in the USSR, in 1974 the band went on its first professional tour; but in 1975 the band dissolved as a result of a conflict with the Philharmonic Society, and it was liquidated by a decree of the Ministry of Culture of the USSR, its name was banned. It was only in 1977 that the band was resurrected under the new name The Stas Namin Group, in 1978 it went on tour still being banned by all central mass media outlets. In 1980, during the years of the Olympic Thaw, the band managed to release a solo album with Melodiya \u2013 Hymn to the Sun \u2013 and participate in a TV show, after that they were banned once again. The period of bans and persecution that lasted to 1986 ended with Perestroika when the life of the band got much easier: with their returned name The Flowers went on tour, performed abroad in the Western countries and completed a world tour in four years. In 1990 the band ceased its activities and, as a matter of fact, did not exist for the next almost ten years. By the end of 80-s the Soviet monopolist record label Melodiya sold over sixty million copies of The Flowers records, but neither Stas Namin, nor the band members were paid out of this record sales. Namin wrote most of The Flowers songs. Many of them were banned, but those which were released became national hits. His song Happiness was a hit No. 1 for three years in 80-s, and even now it remains one of the most beloved songs for Russia and former Soviet Union. Over fifty famous musicians started their careers with The Flowers. Established and produced by Stas Namin in 1987, the Gorky Park rock-band was also formed of The Flowers members. After the re-union in 1999 The Flowers celebrated their 30th Anniversary with a big concert in Moscow, but did not return to show business. They participated in the productions of Hair and Jesus Christ Superstar (Russian versions), and other projects at The Stas Namin Music and Drama Theater. In 2009 the band celebrated its 40th Anniversary with a grand show with special guest-stars, and actively started the new creative life. The Flowers recorded two albums \"The Best of Flowers\" at the Abbey Road studios. In 2013 they released two albums with the brand new songs \u2013 Homo Sapience and Flower Power. In autumn 2014 the Flowers are planning the 45th Anniversary tour that includes 45 cities in Russia, and in 2015 \u2013 a world tour. That will be a farewell tour of the legendary rock-band."@en ;

During their eleven years at Sony, 1993\u20132004, they notched up 11 Top 40 UK singles with three Top 10s, and had a chart presence worldwide.

To date, Apollo's remixes number around 60 - from U2 in the early 1990s to Puff Daddy/Jimmy Page and Ennio Morricone a decade later.

The duo originally released a number of vinyl-only tracks under various aliases, the most well known being Basic Channel and Maurizio, each of which employed their signature brand of minimal techno. The original nine releases under their Basic Channel name were each primarily identified as Basic Channel productions by their catalogue numbers, as the Basic Channel logo on the label became more distorted and unreadable with each subsequent release. The duo set up a studio in Berlin on Paul-Lincke-Ufer, in a building which was eventually to house Mark Ernestus\u2019 distributing company and shop Hard Wax, and the label's mastering studio Dubplates & Mastering, set up to ensure a desired dynamic quality for the vinyl. The Basic Channel imprint ceased business in 1995 (apart from two releases almost a decade later that were originally issued on Carl Craig's Planet E label), but were followed by a string of similar labels. Main Street handled Chicago house-inspired releases; Chain Reaction released non-Von Oswald/Ernestus productions and helped launch the careers of dub techno producers such as Monolake and Porter Ricks. Basic Channel has also shown a strong affinity for Jamaican music. The Rhythm & Sound label imprint saw the duo's sound move closer to dub reggae. Frequent Rhythm & Sound collaborator Paul St. Hilaire set up the subsidiary False Tuned in 2003. Basic Channel occasionally reissues out-of-print music. Basic Replay specialises in dancehall reissues, while Wackies focuses on dub."@en ;

Several backing musicians also performed with the trio; however, these backing musicians were not officially part of Blackhawk until 2008. Prior to the group's formation, Robbins and Stephenson had co-written several Number One singles for the country pop band Restless Heart, and Stephenson had also charted two pop hits in the early 1980s. Paul was previously a member of the Southern rock band Outlaws as well. In 1993, Blackhawk was signed to a record deal with Arista Nashville. Their debut single, \"Goodbye Says It All\", was released that year, peaking at No. 11 on the Billboard Hot Country Singles & Tracks (now Hot Country Songs) charts, and their first album (1994's BlackHawk) was certified 2\u00D7 Multi-Platinum by the RIAA. Throughout the rest of the 1990s, the band continued to chart several singles, in addition to releasing three more albums and a Greatest Hits package. Van Stephenson departed the group in 2000 due to complications from skin cancer. He was replaced with Randy Threet (also a former member of the Outlaws), who made his first appearance on Spirit Dancer, the band's fifth studio album. After Threet's departure in 2003, Anthony Crawford took over as tenor vocalist and lead guitarist; Crawford was, in turn, succeeded by Michael Randall four years later. From early 2008 until he re-joined in 2010, Robbins left the group to resume his songwriting career, and Threet re-joined.

	dbo:abstract	"Fat Freddy\u2019s Drop are a New Zealand seven-piece band from Wellington, whose musical style has been characterised as any combination of dub, reggae, soul, jazz, rhythm and blues, and techno. Originally a jam band formed in the late 1990s by musicians from other bands in Wellington, Fat Freddy\u2019s Drop gradually became its members' sole focus. Band members continued playing with their other respective groups\u2014The Black Seeds, TrinityRoots, Bongmaster, and others\u2014for much of their 13-year career. Fat Freddy\u2019s Drop are known for their improvised live performances; songs on their studio albums are versions refined over years of playing them live in New Zealand, and on tour abroad. The group gained international recognition in 2003 after their single \"Midnight Marauders\" was re-distributed by record labels and DJs in Germany. The group has toured Europe nearly every year since then. The first studio album by Fat Freddy\u2019s Drop, Based on a True Story, was the first independently distributed album to reach first place in New Zealand record sales directly after release in 2005, and is the highest-selling album by a national artist in the country's history. Based on a True Story won Best Album at the New Zealand Music Awards the same year, and remained on the top 40 New Zealand sales chart for over two years, establishing them as one of the most successful contemporary bands in the island nation."@en ;

dbr:Jacob_Fred_Jazz_Odyssey	rdf:type	dbo:Band ;
	dbo:abstract	"Jacob Fred Jazz Odyssey (or JFJO or The Fred) is an American Instrumental Music group started in Tulsa, Oklahoma in 1994. The band has had 16 different members in 20 years and put out 25 albums under the leadership of keyboardist/composer Brian Haas. The current lineup is Haas on piano, Fender Rhodes and synthesizers, Josh Raymer (joined 2007) on drums and Chris Combs (joined 2008) on electric guitar, lap steel, and synthesizer. JFJO's music is not easily categorized; although it is mostly in the jazz idiom, it draws from hip hop, funk and rock music. Critic Alex Henderson describes the band's music as a \"mildly avant-garde blend of jazz, rock and funk [that] draws on a wide variety of influences... Often quirky, eccentric and abstract, JFJO favors an inside/outside approach but is usually more inside than outside.\", while critic Scott Yanow describes the group as \"fascinating\". Their live shows include compositions by John Coltrane, Duke Ellington, Charles Mingus, and Thelonious Monk among others, and include long experimental improvisations that, at times, could be considered atonal. Furthermore, the band's early years as an octet featured a strong hip-hop influence. The group began with different monikers and members in the early 90s including founding members Haas and Reed Mathis, as well as Sean Layton, Dove McHargue, Matt Leland, & Kyle Wright. In 1994, after repeated viewings of This Is Spinal Tap and increased attendance at their shows, the band members agreed on \"Jacob Fred Jazz Odyssey\" as the band's new name. \"Jazz Odyssey\" coming from a scene in the aforementioned Spinal Tap comedy film and \"Jacob Fred\" being what Haas wanted his unborn brother to be named at age 3."@en ;

Along with The Birthday Party, The Go-Betweens, The Moodists and The Triffids, the Laughing Clowns also sought fame in Europe during the early '80s, and gained an international cult status.

	dbo:abstract	"Leb i sol (Macedonian: \u041B\u0435\u0431 \u0438 \u0441\u043E\u043B) is a Macedonian rock group founded in the 1970s by Vlatko Stefanovski (guitar), Bodan Arsovski (bass guitar), Nikola Kokan Dimu\u0161evski (keyboards) and Garabet Tavitjan (drums). Tavitjan ceded the drumwork to Dragoljub \u0110uri\u010Di\u0107 for some of the albums, while Kiril D\u017Eajkovski replaced Kokan on Kao Kakao and Putujemo. Beside being the most eminent Macedonian band, they were also one of the most important acts of the former Yugoslav Rock scene. \"Leb i sol\" is a traditional greeting which literally translates to \"bread and salt\". It is often used as an expression of spite or determination; e.g. \"I will eat bread and salt if I have to, but I will not give in!\", but that has nothing to do with the band's name. More commonly, distinguished visitors to villages and communities would be offered a piece of home-baked bread and a dip of salt as a traditional welcome, which is where the name of the band really came from. Their music combined elements of rock, jazz fusion and ethnic Macedonian music. As the band matured, the jazz influences became less obvious. However, in concert, Leb i sol performances of jazzed-up and lengthy versions of traditional ethno-folk classics such as \"Jovano Jovanke\" or \"Aber Dojde Donke\", were often received with great enthusiasm and cheer. Leb i sol were very popular in the 1970s and 1980s and, while not selling as many records as some pop and folk acts, were very well known and respected and often sold-out venues in most of the larger cities in the former Yugoslavia. The first two albums are often considered foundational, while most are diverse enough to be, at least in part, accessible to a fairly wide audience. The influence of ethnic music and folk music of Republic of Macedonia are recognizable in the use of odd meters (5/4, 7/8) and non-traditional scales (e.g. the Phrygian dominant scale). While all the musicians were fairly accomplished, Vlatko Stefanovski is frequently regarded as an exceptional guitar virtuoso."@en ;

dbr:The_Hold_Steady	rdf:type	dbo:Band ;
	dbo:abstract	"The Hold Steady is an American rock band from Brooklyn, New York, formed in 2004. The band consists of Craig Finn (vocals, guitar), Tad Kubler (guitar), Galen Polivka (bass), Bobby Drake (drums), and Steve Selvidge (guitar). Noted for their \"lyrically dense storytelling,\" and classic rock influences, the band's narrative-based songs frequently address themes, such as drug addiction, religion and redemption, and often feature recurring characters based within the city of Minneapolis. Formed four years following the break-up of Finn and Kubler's former band, Lifter Puller, The Hold Steady released their debut album, Almost Killed Me in 2004, and came to prominence with the release of their third studio album, Boys and Girls in America, in 2006. In 2010, keyboardist and multi-instrumentalist Franz Nicolay left the band prior to the recording of their fifth studio album, Heaven Is Whenever (2010). During the band's subsequent tour, the band became a five piece, once more, with the addition of former Lucero guitarist Steve Selvidge. The band released their sixth LP, Teeth Dreams, on March 25, 2014."@en ;

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/The_Mr._T_Experience>	rdf:type	dbo:Band ;
	dbo:abstract	"The Mr. T Experience (sometimes abbreviated MTX) is an American punk rock band formed in 1985 in Berkeley, California. They have released ten full-length albums along with numerous EPs and singles and have toured internationally. Their music is best classified as pop punk and is intentionally playful, comical, and satirical, often dealing with issues of love and relationships. The band's name is taken from actor and television personality Mr. T. The Mr. T Experience serves mainly as the creative outlet for singer/guitarist \"Dr. Frank\" Portman, its primary songwriter and sole continuous member throughout multiple lineup changes. The band is closely associated with the Berkeley and greater San Francisco Bay Area punk rock movement of the late 1980s and the 1990s, revolving around the 924 Gilman Street venue and the Lookout! Records label, through which they have released all of their albums since 1990. MTX are contemporaries of numerous other groups who emerged from this same \"scene,\" including Green Day, Operation Ivy, Rancid, Jawbreaker, The Donnas, Tilt, and NOFX. They also share stylistic similarities with other bands not native to the Bay area but closely associated with this movement, including The Queers, Screeching Weasel, and the Groovie Ghoulies. Over the years the Mr. T Experience has performed, toured, and shared a record label with many of these bands. They also share a heavy Ramones influence, which was more prevalent in the band's early albums but is still evident in their recent work."@en ;

dbr:The_Real_Tuesday_Weld	rdf:type	dbo:Band ;
	dbo:abstract	"The Real Tuesday Weld are a British band, founded by lead singer and producer Stephen Coates in 1999. They are known for producing jazzy cabaret-style music with subtle electronica influences, a style dubbed \"Antique Beat\" by Coates. They have released six albums, many singles and EPs and many tracks on compilations. Their combination of big band jazz era sounds with electronica has been influential on the current range of electro swing artists and DJs. The band is named after American film actress Tuesday Weld. Coates once had a dream involving Weld and 1930s vocalist Al Bowlly, and cites it as inspiration for the band's particular style. At present, the band is signed to Crammed (Europe, Australasia, South America) and Six Degrees Records (North America). They have previously released recordings with Antique Beat, Kindercore Records, Dreamy Records, Bambini Records, PIAS Recordings and Motorway Records. A German alt-country band by the name of Tuesday Weld that released a CD \"Starscene 98\" on Glitterhouse Records is not related. \"The Clerkenwell Kid\" is often cited as the band's producer / re-mixer but is an alter ego for Coates himself. The 2009 album \"The Clerkenwell Kid: Live at the End of the World\" is an imaginary live recording of a concert on the 'eve of the apocalypse'. The Clerkenwell Kid is also the main character in a London based mythology Coates has developed around his love of the city's history and stories. Their live shows are usually accompanied by visuals in the form of bespoke films and animations. The band's last album is a soundtrack to the novel book \"The Last Werewolf\" (2012) by Glen Duncan reprising their joint work on Duncan's novel \"I, Lucifer\" (2004).In 2010 - 2011, Coates also co-wrote and produced an album \"Horseplay\" as \"Lazarus and the Plane Crash\" - a collaboration with Joe Coles of UK cult garage rockers The Guillotines which was released on Antique Beat in 2012. According to the band's website, Coates has most recently been working on the scores for two indie features, various Russian music relate projects and is recording a new album for release in 2016."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"The Two Lone Swordsmen are British house DJ and producer Andrew Weatherall and studio engineer Keith Tenniswood. Formed in early 1996, following the dissolution of Weatherall's influential Sabres of Paradise techno act, the Swordsmen have explored a variety of styles, from electro and 4/4 techno to post punk and downtempo in later years. Originally they released material on the label Emissions Audio Output, run by Weatherall. However, the small nature of the operation limited the duo's success and they subsequently signed to Warp Records, making them labelmates with acts such as Autechre and Boards of Canada, as well as setting up the Rotters Golf Club label for their more dancefloor-friendly output under various other guises. In 2004 they released From the Double Gone Chapel, exhibiting more of a late 1970s dub and post punk sound than their previous work, influenced heavily by groups like PiL. It was released with the single Sex Beat, a cover of the popular Gun Club song. Their latest album, Wrong Meeting, was released in April 2007, with Wrong Meeting II following a month after. Set solidly in the dub rock vein they explored on From the Double Gone Chapel, the duo venture into sleezy country and LCD Soundsystem-style punk funk disco."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Dragonland is a power metal band from Sweden. The group is most notable for basing their first two and fifth albums upon the self-produced The Dragonland Chronicles fantasy saga and for the original symphonic/electronic parts by Elias Holmlid. The band was founded in September/October 1999 by guitarist Nicklas Magnusson and Jonas Heidgert. Soon after Daniel Kvist, Magnus Olin and Christer Pederson joined in. Their first demo was recorded on January 2000. Only 3 months before the recording of their debut album, The Battle of the Ivory Plains started, Kvist decided to leave the band and was soon replaced by Olof M\u00F6rck. The album was released on April 30, 2001, and the second album, Holy War, was released on February 8, 2002. Both featured singer Jonas Heidgert on drums. In 2003, Dragonland invited Japanese power metal band Galneryus to play with throughout the Japan tour.[citation needed] That was also the first time Dragonland performed the song, \"to the End of the World\", which was included a year later in their third album, Starfall, which was released on October 27, 2004, featuring Jesse Lindskog on drums. Johanna Andersson, Tom S. Englund and Henrik Danhage (Tom and Henrik from Evergrey) provided guest performances on the album, including vocals and guitar solos.Their fourth album, Astronomy, was released on November 11, 2006. Nightrage's Marios Iliopoulos, Amaranthe's Elize Ryd and Jake E and Dead by April's Jimmie Strimell provided guest appearances on this album. Work on a fifth Dragonland album was announced via Blabbermouth on the 27th of April, 2008. In September 2009, Dragonland launched their re-designed Myspace site, together with a high-quality preproduction of \"The Shadow of The Mithril Mountains\", a song from the fifth album. It took some time before the album was completely ready.Five years after \"Astronomy\" the band finally released the new album, Under the Grey Banner, on November 11, 2011. Where \"Starfall\" and \"Astronomy\" are two separate albums \"Under the Grey Banner\" continues the story of their first two albums. On October 25, 2014, it was announced that there will be two new albums, which are a reissue of the first album, the Battle of the Ivory Plains, and a remastered version of the second album, Holy War. Both albums will have brand new cover artwork, and they will be released on December 5 this year. In the first album, there will also be a new song, \"a New Dawn\", as its bonus track. That song does not resemble Evergrey's new song, \"a New Dawn\" (Evergrey is the progressive metal band whose guitarists Tom S. Englund (who is also the lead singer) and Henrik Danhage contributed to Dragonland's third album, Starfall, as mentioned above)."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"The Dogs D'Amour are a rock and roll band formed in 1983 in London, England. Over the years the band has had various line-ups, the only constant being vocalist Tyla. Their 1989 release, A Graveyard of Empty Bottles, reached #16 on the UK chart while the single \"Satellite Kid\" reached #26. In 1991, the band broke up onstage, before reforming briefly in the early 1990s for the release of their sixth studio album More Unchartered Heights of Disgrace. After this, however, the most famous incarnation of the band ceased to exist. There was another brief reunion in 2000 and an album, but, throughout the 2000s, Tyla has been touring and releasing albums under the band name, which is vastly different from their older material. In December 2012 the 'classic' line-up of Tyla, Jo 'Dog' Almeida, Steve James and Bam agreed to reform to play a series of benefit concerts for their long-time friend, and former bandmate, Paul Hornby.In January 2013, the band recorded an E.P. in Florida and have announced live dates for the UK and Spain."@en ;

Their music, which they call monumental dance, is an unusual combination of trance, techno, and vocals which closely resemble Gregorian singing and chanting. Other vocals are performed by German voice actors such as long-time collaborators Christian Br\u00FCckner and Rolf Schult. The primary languages in the songs are German and Latin. After several years with no news of the project, e-mail correspondence between a fan and Chris Tentum (Weller) revealed that the group was in the process of producing new material, due for release some time in the near future. A year after this came to light, a new single from E Nomine appeared on Amazon.de entitled Heilig, due for release on December 28, 2007. The release date was pushed to mid-February 2008. Due to problems with their publisher, hard copies were never shipped, and the song was only made available for download. In the year 2012, the founder of E Nomine Weller and Graner started meanwhile their new project. Schlafes Bruder. It's a self-proclaimed revolution of E Nomine. It's a Hardrock Band which uses Latin chorus. The theme of their first album will be the crusades. The singer is Graner himself, who sang also Heilig and Excalibur, the last two known (but never officially released) E Nomine songs. Both songs are on the first 'Schlafes Bruder' album, released on 22.03.2013. E Nomine's Christian-themed song \"Vater Unser\" (Our Father) and album Das Testament were very popular among the German public."@en ;

Both were in Helicopter Project prior to its breakup though no music from this group was ever released. Afterwards the pair decided to continue to make music together. They subsequently completed three albums in six months. Ben Cooper is also a member of Radical Face (Formerly known as Radical Face Versus Phalex Sledgehammer), Iron Orchestra, and Mother's Basement. The Electric President tracks and most of Ben Coopers projects are recorded in a tool shed in back of his house that he has converted into a recording studio. Electric President's first release was a pseudo-eponymous album (named \"Self-Titled\" rather than \"Electric President\") in early 2006. They gained limited mainstream fame after their music was featured on Fox Network's hit show The OC. At the end of the thirteenth episode of season three, titled \"The Pot Stirrer\", the song \"Insomnia\" is prominently featured in the closing sequence. Electric President's self-titled debut album, S/T, was released in 2006 on German electronica label Morr Music. The record Sleep Well was released June 9, 2008 for Europe and June 24, 2008 for the US. In Mid-April 2008, the album leaked on file-sharing networks. In 2009 Electric President left Morr Music and released their third album, The Violent Blue, with Fake Four Inc. The album was largely made up of songs left over from the making of the groups previous album, Sleep Well. After The Violent Blue, Electric President went into hiatus as Alex Kane wanted to further his career and Ben Cooper focused on other projects, like Radical Face. Electric President's mix of glitch, electronica and indie songwriting has been compared to The Postal Service, Styrofoam, The Weakerthans and Anticon's cLOUDDEAD. In 2013, Ben Cooper announced on the Radical Face website that himself and Alex were planning a fourth Electric President album. He also hinted that it could be a dance record."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Eyedea & Abilities (often abbreviated as E&A) was an influential American indie rap duo from Saint Paul, Minnesota, consisting of DJ Abilities (Gregory Keltgen) and rapper Eyedea (Micheal Larsen). The group was founded in 1999 and became a prominent figure of the 90s underground hip hop scene, known for Larsen's philosophical and socially conscious lyrics, along with Keltgen's dynamic experimental fusion of stylistic elements from both rap and rock, as well as electronic music. The group was active until Larsen's death in October 2010. Over the course of just over a decade, the duo collaborated with many well-known hip hop groups and artists such as Aesop Rock and Sage Francis, playing a preeminent role in the emerging underground rap movement. Larsen's highly successful background work in freestyle rap and rap battles, along with his greatly introspective, complex and poetic sense of lyrical integrity heavily influenced E&A's distinctive musical output and largely defined the group as a unique and stylistically independent presence within alternative hip hop."@en ;

Members included Josephine Conigliaro (lead vocals), Matthieu LeChevalier (drums), and Josh Allen (lead guitar). The band officially formed in 2001 and officially ended in 2005 via their official website.

Although they were never successful, Full Blown Rose subsequently developed a devoted fan base over the internet. Josh, Jessica, Matthieu, Pete, and Chepe all attended the Los Angeles Music Academy. Jessica and Chepe left due to creative differences shortly after the making of their first video in mid-2004. Jessica was replaced by Pete and Chepe was replaced by Mattieu. Though Josephine promised that Full Blown Rose would release one album, the band never officially released any of their material save for one song, \"In the Light,\" which was featured on the Wind-up Records soundtrack album to the film Elektra. They also contributed two songs to the soundtrack of the film Seed of Chucky, though an official soundtrack was never released.

The band formed in early 1995 when ex Membranes frontman, John Robb, put the band together with Wayne Simmons and former Membranes and A Witness vocalist Keith Curtis on bass, Rob Haynes (ex Houndgod and Killing for Pleasure/K.F.P.) on drums and Jay Taylor on guitar. The band signed to Ultimate Records and released their first single, \"Soul Power\", before releasing several more singles and two albums - Home Turf (1996/97), and Goldblade Drop the Bomb (1998) before Simmons departed. In 2000, Goldblade then recruited a new percussionist, Martin Gray, into the line up and recorded two further singles \"AC/DC\" and \"Who Was The Killa?\" together with a third album Do You Believe In The Power Of Rock 'n' Roll all released in 2002 on a new label, Twenty Stone Blatt. In 2001, Jay Taylor left the band to concentrate on his Bonebox project, and two new members Johny Skullknuckles and Pete 'Gorgeous' Byrchmore (ex-Nightingales, and U.K Subs) were recruited to begin work on the next album, Rebel Songs (2004). Second percussionist Gray left shortly after the recording sessions, and the album was released in 2005 on the Captain Oi! label. The band continued gigging and recording as a five-piece, with the next album Mutiny (also on Captain Oi! Records) released in 2008. Both \"Rebel Songs\" and \"Mutiny\" were also issued internationally. Goldblade continue to tour extensively. They regularly appear at major UK music festivals, including Glastonbury Festival, Reading Festival, Wickerman Festival and Rebellion Festival, and several smaller ones (Strummercamp). They have played in St Petersburg to 25,000 people, in Serbia and, in early 2010, in Algiers (being one of only a handful of Western bands to do so). In March 2010, Skullknuckles departed to be replaced by another guitarist Andy Taylor (not the one from Duran Duran). Goldblade issued a compilation album, Beyond God & Elvis in China (on Kids-Union Records) in September 2010, following it with dates in Beijing. On 20 May 2013 Goldblade released the album The Terror Of Modern Life on Overground Records in CD, Vinyl and download formats."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Kryst the Conqueror (Pronounced \"Christ the Conqueror\") was an American Christian metal project, enormously unpopular, formed in August of 1987 by two former members of the horror punk band, The Misfits. The project was led by bassist Jerry Only, who adopted a new stage name, \"Mo The Great\" (or alternately, \"Mocavious Kryst\"), and his younger brother, guitarist Doyle Wolfgang von Frankenstein. The band fused fantastical and sci-fi imagery with religious themes and messages. The band has also been referred to as a \"guitar shop project\", as Only and Doyle constantly tweaked and refined their instruments throughout the band's existence, in an attempt to create what they felt would be the ultimate bass and guitar. In 1988, they formed The Doyle Fan Club in order to promote the new project and stay in touch with fans of The Misfits. According to various interviews conducted at the time, and a series of fan club letters written by Jerry Only (as \"Mo The Great\") from 1988 to 1990, Kryst the Conqueror was meant to be Only's vision of the \"perfect\" band. He hoped the \"righteous\" message of the band would reach out to fans, especially those who had followed former Misfits frontman, Glenn Danzig's post-Misfits career with the bands Samhain and Danzig - bands which Jerry felt were satanic, evil and possibly damaging to impressionable youths. A full album, Deliver Us From Evil, was recorded, although it has never been officially released in its entirety. Instead, five of the album's tracks were released in 1990 as an EP for a special Christmas package. The band never had an official lead singer, although noted Yngwie Malmsteen vocalist, Jeff Scott Soto, was hired to record vocals for the album (as he was still under contract with Yngwie, he was billed on the EP as \"Kryst the Conqueror\"). Also, Dave \"The Snake\" Sabo did a guest guitar solo on the song \"Spellbound.\" Though the band never played live, Kryst the Conqueror survived as a non-active band until 1995, at which time Jerry and Doyle reached an out of court settlement with Glenn Danzig, granting them the rights to perform as The Misfits. Kryst the Conqueror was then quickly revamped into what would become the second incarnation of The Misfits. Some Kryst the Conqueror songs were eventually re-written into songs for the \"resurrected\" Misfits."@en ;

dbr:Nortec_Collective	rdf:type	dbo:Band ;
	dbo:abstract	"Nortec Collective is a musical ensemble formed by various individual one or two man production projects. The group came together in Tijuana, Baja California, Mexico. Their sound genre mixes electronica with musical elements and instrumentation of Tambora and Norte\u00F1o music, resulting in the nortec (\"norte\u00F1o\" + \"techno\") style. The various projects began producing and performing Nortec music around 1999. In 2001, they were signed to a recording contract with Palm Pictures, that released their first album \"Tijuana Session Volume 1\" under the name Nortec Collective. The line-up for that album included Bostich, Clorofila, Fussible, Hiperboreal, Panoptica, Plankton Man and Terrestre. The latter two would leave Nortec Collective in 2002. Nortec Collective's second album, Tijuana Sessions, Vol. 3, (Nacional Records) received much critical praise and was nominated for two Latin Grammy awards in 2006. In 2008, Nortec Collective ceased to function as a proper collective, with the various individual projects performing and recording separately. According to the Collective's Myspace page, \"For the time being, Nortec Collective has decided to release music separately ...\" and \"Until further notice, there will be not be any bookings for Nortec, Nortec Collective or Colectivo Nortec with the full four member line-up.\" The various individual projects went on to release and perform separately. 2008's Tijuana Sound Machine by Bostich and Fussible (also Nacional Records) was nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Latin Rock/Alternative Album. The Nortec Collective has borrowed several elements of Banda music sub-culture and have used them both in their songs (Narcoteque, Almada) and in their visuals and album covers."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"The Sch\u00FCrzenj\u00E4ger, formerly Zillertaler Sch\u00FCrzenj\u00E4ger, are one of the most successful bands of Austria. \"Sch\u00FCrzenj\u00E4ger\" is a German term for \"Heartbreaker\", which was first used in the early 1900s. (Literally translated, a Sch\u00FCrzenj\u00E4ger is a \"skirt hunter\": Sch\u00FCrze = skirt, J\u00E4ger = hunter) The band was founded in 1973; according to the band history, they were named \"Sch\u00FCrzenj\u00E4ger\" by a female bartender in Austria during a concert, when they didn't have a band name. While they started out playing traditional music with modern instruments, their style developed over the years to incorporate folk music, Pop music, and Rock music. One of their first big hits was the \"Zillertaler Hochzeitsmarsch\", a modern interpretation of a traditional folk dance melody. From then on they began to introduce more rock elements, inspired by their new (1990) drummer Patrick Cox. After \"Zillertal Hochzeitsblues (1990)\" they moved to the wider German audience under Montana (Later BMG Ariola) in 1991. With their commercial success, the \"Sch\u00FCrzenj\u00E4ger\" became the epitome for filling the gap between rock and \"Volksmusik\" in Austria, establishing the genre of \"Alpen Rock\" (Alpine Rock). The folk music community, however, saw the success of the \"Zillertaler Hochzeitsmarsch\" not as a success but as an abuse of traditional music. The Sch\u00FCrzenj\u00E4ger regularly ended their tours with the biggest open-air concerts in Austria. Since 1988 these concerts, called \"Alpen Air\" (a pun of \"Alpen\" and \"Open Air\"), were played every other year. From March to July 2007, the Sch\u00FCrzenj\u00E4ger went on tour for the last album \"Lust auf mehr\". This was the final tour with the lineup around band leader Steinlechner, culminating in the traditional \"Alpen Air\" in Finkenberg, Zillertal on Saturday 21 July 2007. The Eberharters then founded their own band, the \"Hey Mann! Band\" (HM!B), which performed Sch\u00FCrzenj\u00E4ger songs live, an album was also recorded. On 3 May 2011 the comeback and a new album of the Sch\u00FCrzenj\u00E4ger was announced for September 2011, before that an open-air concert will stage on 6 August in Finkenberg. The band consists of the Hey Mann! Band members Stevy (Stefan Wilhelm, vocals), Johannes Hintersteiner, Andreas Marberger, Georg Daviotis and the Eberharters, the last being the only members of the old Sch\u00FCrzenj\u00E4ger lineup. According to the band, former band leader Steinlechner doesn't want to get back on stage, save for a few guest appearances now and then. Cox and von Haniel are already busy with other projects."@en ;

Taking their name from the Celtic folklore-influenced comic book Sl\u00E1ine, the band released their self-titled debut album in 1996. The band combines influences from traditional heavy metal bands such as Iron Maiden, Brocas Helm and Thin Lizzy, and English folk metal band Skyclad.[citation needed] Slough Feg's 2003 album Traveller was a concept album based on GDW's role playing game of the same name. With the release of Atavism in 2005, the band officially shortened its name to Slough Feg. Guitarist Mike Scalzi maintains that the band always referred to itself this way internally, and the addition of \"The Lord Weird\" made it too difficult to find Slough Feg albums in stores (which alphabetized the CDs in inconsistent ways). Slough Feg is currently signed to Metal Blade Records and most recently released Digital Resistance on February 18th, 2014."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"The Court & Spark was a San Francisco-based indie rock band formed in the spring of 1998 around the nucleus of Scott Hirsch, Alex Stimmel, James Kim, and lead vocalist M.C. Taylor. Between 1998 and 2001 the group established itself among the leaders of the alt-country Americana scene. After Hirsch and Taylor's early and noisy participation in Ex-Ignota, the two (along with bassist Joe Rogers and others) found themselves in San Francisco, and formed the country-oriented group, taking cues from the classic sounds of the early country-rock era as well as incorporating more sonically progressive and multi-faceted compositions as evidenced on their tUMULt Records 1999 debut Ventura Whites. The group achieved acclaim with their 2001 release Bless You which included support from pedal steel player Tom Heyman and vocalist Wendy Allen, as well as former Byrd and Flying Burrito Brother Gene Parsons. A review in Pitchfork by Christopher F. Schiel which gave it an impressive score of 9.0 (later inexplicably downgraded to 8.4 ) as well as feature in December 2001 on NPR's All Things Considered by Sarah Bardeen. helped gain the band recognition. The band returned in 2004 with Witch Season as well as the EP - Dead Diamond River featuring contributions from Linda Thompson and M. Ward. The Court & Spark officially disbanded in the summer of 2007 with a post to the band's website, \"It's hard to say that The C&S is breaking up, as we still spend all our time together, but seeing as how we're all involved in different musical projects, it seems best to retire the C&S name for a while. We've had a good run and have had the good fortune to meet all kinds of wonderful souls as we've stumbled down the road. Thank you one and all for everything you've given us.\" M.C. Taylor and Scott Hirsch moved to the East Coast\u2014Chapel Hill, NC and New York City respectively\u2014and started a new project together called Hiss Golden Messenger which has released two albums, Country Hai East Cotton and Root Work with a new release Bad Debt coming in November 2010 on Black Maps."@en ;

The band consists of guitarist/vocalist Sam Mickens, Jherek Bischoff on bass and Nick Tamburro on drums. Jherek Bischoff's brother Korum was the drummer from the band's inception in 1999 through 2005. Tamburro, who'd shared drumming duties with him on the recording of Frost Giant and had previously acted as The Dead Science's touring drummer, joined permanently upon his departure. Korum is still credited on the band's label page with \"guidance, stability and sometimes drums.\" Their music is heavily influenced by their training as jazz musicians and involvement in the avant-garde music of a number of artists, most notably Xiu Xiu and Degenerate Art Ensemble. Mickens has also cited Prince as an influence on his vocal style, often noted in reviews of the bands' work for its use of falsetto. The trio self-released their limited run debut EP Galactose under their original moniker, The Sweet Science, before giving up the name due to a cease-and-desist order from another band. Following the name change, The Dead Science released their debut album Submariner on Absolutely Kosher Records in 2003. This was followed by the release of their second EP Bird Bones in the Bughouse in 2004, their second album Frost Giant in 2005, and a third EP Crepuscule with The Dead Science in 2006. They were also named winner in the 'Jazz/Experimental' category in Seattle Weekly's 2006 Music Awards.

The group also included two sisters, Dotti and Sheri Holmberg, with Ron Neilson, as lead guitarist and banjo player. They recorded two obscure albums for Epic Records in 1964 before adding drummer Ron Edgar to their lineup, who would later be a part of the groups The Music Machine and The Millennium. They recorded a third album in late 1964. A single from this proposed album, \"June Bride Baby\" b/w \"I'm Gonna Marry You\" was released in early 1965, but the group broke up afterwards and the album remains unreleased. Boettcher would go on as a record producer, songwriter and musician, eventually putting together The Millennium. Nothing has been heard from the others, except for Dotti Holmberg, when Sundazed Records released an album of demos that she recorded in the mid-1960s called Sometimes Happy Times, including one that had ended up on the Magic Time anthology, and the song (\"I Sing My Song\") that would later be included on the second Sagittarius album. She also maintains a website dedicated to the group, and has published an eBook about the group titled \"Whatever Happened to Jezebel?\"."@en ;

Started in 1995 by Gary Olson, Edward Powers and Javier Villegas, the band quickly released Marlborough Farms on Park N' Ride records, adding and subtracting a couple of members and going on an international tour. With Jeff Baron (Guppyboy, The Essex Green) and Jennifer Baron (Saturnine) added to the lineup, they released Beverley Atonale in 1997, this time on Merge Records. Powers left the band, and the remaining members, with San Fadyl and Sasha Bell of The Essex Green and solo act Finishing School, embarked on a United States tour. With a more stable lineup, the band released The Albemarle Sound in 1999, as well as added violinist and bassist Julia Rydholm (The Four Corners, The Essex Green, Jens Lekman) to the lineup. In 2001, Argyle Heir was released. In 2003 the band recorded a self-titled album at WaveLab Studio with engineer Craig Schumacher in Tucson, Arizona. In 2006 the band contributed heavily to the recording of Kevin Ayers' album The Unfairground which Gary Olson produced. In April 2006, Fadyl began fighting serious asthma attacks. On the 26th of April 2007, he died due to one such attack. The band released their sixth album, \"Can't Wait Another Day\", on June 5, 2007. This line up included Kyle Forester (Crystal Stilts) and Ben Crum of Great Lakes. For their seventh album Clutching Stems, Olson, Forester, and Rydholm gathered new recruits Mark Dzula (The Magic Caravan, Jukebox Radio), Eric Farber (The Lisps), and Michael O'Neill (MEN). The album, recorded at Marlborough Farms (studio) and Sunset Cottage, Poconos, was released on June 6, 2011, by Merge Records."@en ;

dbr:The_Nerve_Agents	rdf:type	dbo:Band ;
	dbo:abstract	"The Nerve Agents were an American hardcore punk band formed by Andy Outbreak and Eric Ozenne (ex-Redemption 87). Their angry brand of music juxtaposed yelled, sometimes ranting vocals with distorted and often chorus laden chords, complex bass lines and fast-paced percussion. Their darkened style is reminiscent of Black Flag & The Damned. The Nerve Agents were noted for their frenzied, chaotic, often violent live performances. It was not unusual for a fan or band member to require medical attention. Often on such occasions Eric Ozenne would halt performances, sometimes escorting the injured fan to the hospital. Other theatrical elements, such as costumes and the trademark eyeliner, were commonplace. On rare occasions a guest performer known only as the 'White Owl', (taking its name from the theme of the first full length), would run across the stage in a white mummy-like robe. There are many rumors surrounding the band's demise. Andy Outbreak's involvement in The Distillers became a source of scheduling tension, as was the pending birth of Eric Ozenne's daughter. The band played their last two shows on Sunday, December 30, at the Pound in San Francisco, sharing the bill with Lars Frederiksen and the Bastards. Members of The Nerve Agents are now/or used to be in the bands White Fence, Said Radio, Darker My Love, The Fall, The Frisk, Hudson Criminal, Model American, Fury 66, The Distillers, Redemption 87, Pitch Black, Unit Pride, Shadowboxer, and FIVE."@en ;

Although they failed to meet with commercial success, they built a small but loyal base of fans. They are remembered mostly for a quirky vocal style and for a curious campaign Smirks against Travolta, simultaneously a homage and a parody of Rock Against Racism. The Smirks session for the John Peel show was recorded on 19 April 1978 and broadcast a week later. Despite being more of the new wave/power pop genre, they did support Killing Joke and Joy Division at the ULU gig in London, 1980. Their acrimonious dispute with Beserkley Records, for whom they recorded an album that was never released, is also noteworthy and was the subject of a BBC Radio 4 documentary. The album was finally due to be released in October 2007, but was delayed by the sale of Sanctuary Records to Universal Music and is still awaiting release."@en ;

dbr:The_Subdudes	rdf:type	dbo:Band ;
	dbo:abstract	"The Subdudes (stylized[clarification needed] as The subdudes) are an American roots rock group from New Orleans. Their music is a blending of American folk, swamp pop, New Orleans rhythm and blues, Louisiana blues, country, cajun/zydeco, funk, soul and gospel with harmonic vocals. Their sound is notable for the band's substitution of a tambourine player for a drummer. The subdudes formed in 1987 through a music venue in New Orleans called Tipitinas. The Subdudes often credit their songwriting to the group as a whole, although the primary songwriters are Tommy Malone (brother of The Radiators guitarist Dave Malone) and John Magnie. Current members of the band are Malone, vocals, acoustic, electric and slide guitars; Magnie, vocals, accordion, keyboards; Steve Amed\u00E9e, tambourine, drums, other percussions, and vocals; Tim Cook, percussion, bass and vocals; and Jimmy Messa, bass and guitar. They are an Americana band with a rock-based sound that also shows soul, gospel, blues, cajun/zydeco, country, and other American roots music influences. Their former bass player was Johnny Ray Allen, who had not been with the band since the band's 1996 farewell tour (documented the next year on the Live at Last CD) until a brief reunion in 2014. Willie Williams also contributed to three albums: Annunciation, Primitive Streak and Live at Last as a second guitarist. After regrouping in 2002 (first as The Dudes but then re-adopting the name 'subdudes' in March 2003), Bob Dylan's guitarist Freddy Koella helped produce Miracle Mule. The album Behind the Levee (2006) was produced by bluesman Keb' Mo' and yielded a minor hit, \"Papa Dukie and the Mud People\" (better known by its refrain, \"Love is a Beautiful Thing\"). Released in late 2007, the album Street Symphony was recorded in Nashville, Tennessee at Blackbird Studios during March 2007 and was produced by George Massenberg, who has worked with Little Feat. Released in late 2008, Live at the Ram's Head is available on CD or as a two DVD set, with one disc being the live show from \"The Ram's Head\" in Annapolis, Maryland, and the second DVD being Unplugged at Pleasant Plains, with interviews and live studio footage from the recording of Street Symphony in Nashville. Most recently (2009), the band's self-produced Flower Petals was recorded in Magnie's basement studio then mixed in Miami, Florida by The Albert Brothers and Steve Alaimo. The album was a departure for the band, much more country-oriented than previous releases. The cover art was by William Matthews, a Denver, Colorado artist well known for his Old West-style paintings. Flower Petals was originally slated to be recorded as the follow-up to Miracle Mule in 2004 but was nixed by the band's record company at the time, Back Porch Records. Five years later, the band members financed the recording themselves then shopped around the completed tapes. The Subdudes' stature as New Orleans musicians has recently been reflected by their inclusion individually and as a group in the HBO series Treme. After a hiatus since 2011, the original line-up reunited, with Johnny Ray Allen on bass, in March 2014. Johnny Ray Allen died at age 56 on August 8, 2014. The band has continued to tour with Tim Cook on bass."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Eagles of Death Metal is an American rock band from Palm Desert, California, formed in 1998. Founded by Jesse Hughes (vocals, guitar) and Josh Homme (drums), the band also includes a wide range of other musicians that perform both on the band's studio albums and at live shows. Hughes and Homme are the only permanent members of the band, with Homme rarely performing at live shows due to commitments to his other bands. The band's current touring line-up includes Hughes alongside Dave Catching (guitar), Eden Galindo (guitar), Matt McJunkins (bass) and Julian Dorio (drums). Despite their band name, Eagles of Death Metal are not a death metal band. In a video interview taken at a converse music.co.uk sponsored event at the Soho Revue Bar in London, Hughes states that he and Homme were in a bar watching a man dance to the song \"Wind of Change\" by the Scorpions. When asked what he was doing, the man yelled, \"This is death metal, dude!\", to which Homme replied, \"No it's not. This is like the Eagles of death metal.\" An alternate story concerning the origin of the band name claims that the name originated during an exchange in which a friend of Josh Homme was attempting to convert Hughes to the death metal genre. When the friend played a song by the Polish band Vader and made a claim that the song was within the death metal genre, Homme then referred to Vader as \"the Eagles of death metal\". After hearing this phrase, Hughes wondered what a cross between the Eagles and a death metal band would sound like. In a 2003 interview Homme described the sound of the band as a combination of \"bluegrass slide guitar mixed with stripper drum beats and Canned Heat vocals.\" Hughes is known for his enthusiastic interaction with audiences at live performances. While the band were on stage at Le Bataclan in Paris, France, on November 13, 2015, the audience was attacked by terrorists wielding automatic rifles, grenades and suicide vests. The death toll inside the venue was 89, including the group's merchandise manager, but the band members escaped safely out of the venue via a door backstage."@en ;

They signed with Capricorn Records and in 1973 released their first LP, The Marshall Tucker Band. After Tommy Caldwell was killed in an automobile accident in 1980, he was replaced by bassist Franklin Wilkie. Most of the original band members had left by the mid-1980s to pursue other projects. The band's current lineup consists of Gray on vocals, keyboard player and flautist Marcus James Henderson, guitarist Rick Willis, bassist Pat Elwood, and drummer B.B. Borden."@en ;

dbr:Friends_of_the_Bride	rdf:type	dbo:Band ;
	dbo:abstract	"Friends of the Bride were a short-lived London-based indie pop band (sometimes shortened to 'FoTB'). Consisting of Bobby Grindrod (vocals), Osamu Yano (guitar), Kerin Smith (bass) and Billy Reeves AKA Brian Feltham (drums); the band won the 2006 London leg of the BBC's Electric Proms 'Next Stage' competition and secured their first gig as part of the festival (which also featured performances by The Who, James Brown and Paul Weller). Drawing from a diverse range of influences that included 1960s jazz, Northern soul and Y\u00E9-y\u00E9 as well as new wave music, garage rock and Anthony Newley, the band employed a traditional 'Tin Pan Alley'-inspired songwriting approach. Despite their traditional indie format (guitar, bass, drums and vocals), front man Bobby Grindrod was known for his unique jazz-influenced vocal style and they were cited by The Times as \"head[ing] the nu croon scene\". In 2007, Grindrod's unusually smart appearance (influenced by early to mid-1960s fashion) prompted London's Metro newspaper to run a full page style feature on him. Such shameless appreciation for 1960s styling has led to accusations of 'retroism', however the band refuted this; claiming that all contemporary music is clearly and heavily indebted to the past and therefore \"[i]n its current usage, 'retro' is a misleading and repressive term that should be avoided at all costs\". Friends of the Bride released two singles (Buckle Up, Sunshine! and So, You Think You Can Dance?) on London's Young and Lost Club label in 2007 as well as contributing You Can't Take him Anywhere and Hey Buddy to a split EP (also featuring contributions from Manchester electro-pop group, Modernaire) on Brainlove Records in 2008. Between 2000 and 2006, Bobby Grindrod fronted Bath-based new wave/garage rock outfit, The Fog Band who released an acclaimed EP The Law of The Sea on Bath's Purr Records. Initially, his vocal approach was heavily influenced by 1960s Rhythm and blues but as the band progressed he began to experiment with a 'cleaner' vocal approach (retained and developed in Friends of the Bride). Fog Band songwriter Oli Daltrey (son of Peter Daltrey, lead singer of 1960s psychedelic band, Kaleidoscope) began to accommodate this development in songs like 'The Cummerbund Years' and an exciting future beckoned. Despite this, the band soon became inexplicably defunct. In 2006, Grindrod contributed to the short-lived music project, A Conversation Piece alongside Pagan Wanderer Lu and Simon Love (lead singer of The Loves). He also provided some backing vocals and narration on The Loves' second album, Technicolour, in the same year. Billy Reeves and Kerin Smith previously performed in '90s indie band theaudience alongside Sophie Ellis-Bextor."@en ;

They make their first public appearance in M\u00E9rida, in the Bullfighting Arena of M\u00E9rida November 20, 1982. In Caracas they were an overwhelming success, enlivening parties and private shows. Then came the professionalization by recording several albums, performing on radio and television. They have toured in Spain, Germany, Portugal and the Caribbean countries. The \"ca\u00F1onera music\" is a musical style born in the capital of Venezuela in the early 20th century. It is the first urban musical expression in this country. It has many similarities with the Dixieland developed in New Orleans. The groups that play \"ca\u00F1onera\" music include several Venezuelan rhythms like the venezuelan merengue, a variant of the pasodoble, joropo, and Venezuelan waltz. Currently there are only two groups dedicated to preserving the traditional music of Caracas: Los Anta\u00F1os del Stadium (1946) and Los Ca\u00F1oneros. Their most recent record is Esta es Caracas (2012), a venezuelan merengue featuring some of the most important singers in Venezuela: Cecilia Todd, Horacio Blanco (lead vocal for the ska band Desorden Publico), Rams\u00E9s Meneses a.k.a.

In accordance to the prophecy and after completing their world conquest, the band disbanded at the end of the century on December 31, 1999 at 23:59:59. However, the band has had several limited reunions since their disbandment. One in 2005 to celebrate their 20th anniversary and another in 2010 celebrating their 25th anniversary, the latter including their first ever world tour. In 2011, an encore of their world tour was held and the band hosted two charity concerts that included several different artists in response to the T\u014Dhoku earthquake and tsunami. They performed a two leg 30th anniversary tour from September 2015 into January 2016."@en ;

dbr:Thee_Oh_Sees	rdf:type	dbo:Band ;
	dbo:abstract	"Thee Oh Sees is an American garage rock band from San Francisco, California, formed in 1997. The band currently consists of primary songwriter and core member John Dwyer (vocals, guitar), Tim Hellman (bass) and drummers, Ryan Moutinho and Dan Rincon. Thee Oh Sees sound incorporates a wide range of rock genres, including 1960s garage rock and psychedelic rock, punk rock, noise rock, art punk, and 1980s post-punk. Initially an outlet for Dwyer (Coachwhips, Pink and Brown and The Hospitals) to release experimental home recordings, Thee Oh Sees evolved into a full band, featuring Brigid Dawson (vocals, keyboard), Petey Dammit (bass, guitar), Mike Shoun (drums), and Lars Finberg (drums, guitar). Over the course of several releases and genre transitions, the band became noted for their prolific discography, energetic live shows, and whimsical visual aesthetic. The band has changed its lineup and name several times, having previously being known as Orinoka Crash Suite, OCS, Orange County Sound, The Ohsees and The Oh Sees. In late 2013, it was announced that the band would be entering a hiatus. A new studio album, however, entitled Drop, was released in 2014, and the Thee Oh Sees subsequently toured as a three-piece, with Sic Alps bassist Tim Hellman and White Fence drummer Nick Murray replacing Dawson, Dammit!, and Shoun. In 2015, Dawson returned to the band, in a studio capacity, for its next studio album, Mutilator Defeated At Last. Following its release, Dwyer and Hellman began touring with two drummers, Ryan Moutinho and Dan Rincon, replacing Murray."@en ;

The amalgamation of these three names, of these three semantic ideas, is the word Berrog\u00FCetto, that would come to mean the shout of the ghetto - the oppressed ones.

Weilerstein formed the group that summer at the Marlboro Music School and Festival with violinist Peter Salaff, violist Martha Strongin Katz, and cellist Paul Katz. The group was initially called the \"New Cleveland Quartet.\" In 1971, the group left the Cleveland Institute because of disagreements over teaching loads and took up residency at the University at Buffalo, The State University of New York; they dropped the word \"New\" from their name at this time. In 1976 they made their final change of residency, moving to the Eastman School of Music in Rochester, New York. The quartet had three personnel changes: violist Atar Arad replaced Strongin Katz in 1980; violist James Dunham then replaced Arad in 1987; and William Preucil replaced Weilerstein as first violin in 1989. The quartet disbanded in 1995. Preucil became concertmaster of the Cleveland Orchestra, a position he still holds. Paul Katz, Martha Strongin Katz and Donald Weilerstein are on the faculty of the New England Conservatory of Music, and Weilerstein performs in a trio with his wife Vivian Hornik Weilerstein and his daughter, cellist Alisa Weilerstein; Peter Salaff is on the faculty of the Cleveland Institute of Music; Atar Arad teaches at the Jacobs School of Music at Indiana University; and James Dunham teaches at the Shepherd School of Music at Rice University.

The band consists of Bradford Cox (vocals, guitar, keyboards), Moses Archuleta (drums), Lockett Pundt (guitar, vocals) and Josh McKay (bass). Founded by Cox and Archuleta, Deerhunter's first stable line-up included guitarist Colin Mee and bass guitarist Justin Bosworth. After recording a split EP with Alphabets, Bosworth died of head injuries, suffered during a skateboarding accident. His death influenced the recording of the band's first studio album, Turn It Up Faggot (2005), with Josh Fauver occupying the vacant role of bass guitarist. Following the album's release, Cox asked childhood friend, Lockett Pundt, to join Deerhunter as its second guitarist and occasional lead vocalist. Recorded in two days, the band's follow-up, Cryptograms (2007), combined ambient work and indie rock songs. The release was quickly followed by the EP, Fluorescent Grey. While touring the releases, Mee departed from Deerhunter, due to disagreements over the band's schedule, but rejoined soon after. Deerhunter released two studio albums, Microcastle and Weird Era Cont., in 2008. Both albums were recorded without the participation of Mee, who again departed for a second and final time. The band enlisted former cheerleader and high school friend of Cox, Whitney Petty, as his touring replacement. Recorded as a four-piece with producer Ben H. Allen, the band's fourth studio album, Halcyon Digest (2010), was released to widespread critical acclaim. In 2012, the departure of long-time bassist Fauver placed the band's future in doubt.

Their biggest US hit single, \u201CWish I Had an Angel\u201D (2004), made it onto three US film soundtracks as a means to promote their North American tour.

Formed in '99 by bassist Ricci Gurango after his departure from Hungry Young Poets, MOJOFLY reeled in mainstream and alternative crowds alike with the debut album Birth Day (1999) and follow-up A Million Stories (2002), both released under Sony BMG Philippines. Then-lead singer Kitchie Nadal helped propel singles such as Another Day and Scooter Boy to national recognition. But in May 2003, Nadal left the group to embark on a solo career. Mojofly then introduced Lougee Basabas as the band\u2019s new frontwoman in only a matter of days. By year\u2019s end the group joined the \u201Cindie\u201D bandwagon with their self-titled EP, sold-out despite being available only in gigs. Because of Mata and the revived, revv-ed up Lougee-version of Minamalas, MOJOFLY (EP) showed the new sound of their group. The band went on to release an LP aptly entitled MOJOFLY Now (June, 2005), still under independent label luKas Music of artist manager and music publisher Karin Araneta. This time distributed nationwide by EMI Music Philippines, Lougee took over the reins in songwriting and gained MOJOFLY \u201Cstreet cred\u201D through her novel, cutting-edge compositions. Currently promoting MOJOFLY Now Special Edition (August, 2006), the 2-disc package marries the original \u201805 full-length and an A-VCD featuring live tracks from their first major concert at the Music Museum (September, 2005) and the 3D-animated music video of Tumatakbo. MOJOFLY is the first local artist to venture into full 3D animation in Philippine music video history. The work was previewed at the 19th Singapore International Film Festival (April, 2006) and won Best Animated Video and Favorite Indie Video at the MTV Pilipinas Video Music Awards 2006] (August, 2006). Apart from once garnering the much-coveted slot for MTV Lokal Artist-of-the-Month (March, 2005), MOJOFLY also boasts a list of celebrity endorsements from Del Monte Pizza Sauce to Penshoppe and Cream Silk Conditioners. The theme song Choose and vast multi-media exposure from the Cream Silk \u201CGirl Power, Pink Power\u201D campaign brought MOJOFLY\u2019s sound and Lougee\u2019s vivid image into every household. On 2008, Ricci Gurango, the last original member of MOJOFLY, left the band. The remaining members took in Richard Carandang and Ace Evangelista to play the bass and lead guitar.

Prior to the release of their first album, they opened for Switchfoot, The Fray, Will Hoge, Pete Yorn, Blue October, and many others on several different nationwide tours. In October 2007, original guitarist Will Mason announced his departure from the band. The Inside failed to make a major splash in the market, so Moses Mayfield began to write in hopes of creating a followup to their critically acclaimed major label release. Unfortunately due to a realignment of personal goals the band decided to take an indefinite hiatus in December 2007. Not long after the band broke up, lead singer Matthew Mayfield started playing shows centered on the Birmingham, AL area, usually solo acoustic but occasionally with a new backing band. Within a year, he independently released an album of acoustic songs, including acoustic versions of songs that previously appeared on The Inside. He also revealed that Moses Mayfield called it quits mainly due to disagreements with the record label, as well as some members deciding they wanted to leave the band due to these disagreements. A combination of those two items led to the sudden break-up."@en ;

It was founded in 1993 as an acoustic female duo of Diana Arbenina (Russian: \u0414\u0438\u0430\u043D\u0430 \u0421\u0435\u0440\u0433\u0435\u0301\u0435\u0432\u043D\u0430 \u0410\u0440\u0431\u0435\u043D\u0438\u043D\u0430) and Svetlana Surganova (Russian: \u0421\u0432\u0435\u0442\u043B\u0430\u043D\u0430 \u042F\u043A\u043E\u0432\u043B\u0435\u0432\u043D\u0430 \u0421\u0443\u0440\u0433\u0430\u043D\u043E\u0432\u0430). The ladies played guitar and violin respectively, sharing the vocal and songwriting duties evenly, eventually adding amplification to the band. Since its inception the band has participated in a variety of Russian musical festivals \u2014 from the underground (such as Babye Leto and Moguchaya Kuchka) to the major events (Nashestvie, Maxidrom, Krylya), as well as touring extensively domestically and abroad. Night Snipers best known singles are Tridtsatpervaya Vesna (\"31st Spring\"), Rubezh (\"Frontier\"), Stolitsa (\"Capital\"), Asfalt (\"Asphalt\"), and Aktrisa (\"Actress\"). The majority of the songs in the band's repertoire is written by Arbenina and Surganova, but some use the poetry of such famous authors as Joseph Brodsky, Anna Akhmatova, and Federico Garcia Lorca. In 2002 Svetlana Surganova left the band to create her own group Surganova i Orkestr (\"Surganova and Orchestra\"), and Diana remained the headliner of Night Snipers."@en ;

dbr:OneRepublic	rdf:type	dbo:Band ;
	dbo:abstract	"OneRepublic is an American pop rock band. Formed in Colorado Springs, Colorado in 1996 by Ryan Tedder and Zach Filkins, the band achieved commercial success on Myspace as an unsigned act. In late 2003, after OneRepublic played shows throughout the Los Angeles area, a number of record labels approached the band with interest, but OneRepublic ultimately signed with Velvet Hammer, an imprint of Columbia Records. They made their first album with producer Greg Wells during the summer and fall of 2005 at his studio, Rocket Carousel, in Culver City, California. The album was originally scheduled for release on June 6, 2006, but the group was dropped by Columbia two months before the album ever came out. The lead single of that album, \"Apologize\", was released in 2005. It received some recognition on Myspace in 2006. In 2007, OneRepublic released their debut album, Dreaming Out Loud. Its lead single, \"Apologize\", was notably remixed by Timbaland, becoming a huge international success, reaching number one in sixteen countries, subsequently earning them a Grammy Award nomination. The second single, \"Stop and Stare\", mirrored its predecessor's success. The album was later certified Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). The band's second album, Waking Up (2009), produced the successful singles, \"All the Right Moves\", \"Secrets\", \"Marchin On\", and \"Good Life\", with Good Life reaching the top ten of the US Billboard Hot 100. OneRepublic's third album, Native (2013), became the band's first top ten album on the Billboard 200, and highest charting album to date, charting at number four. The lead single, \"If I Lose Myself\", charted within the top ten in several countries, while the album's third single, \"Counting Stars\", became the band's most successful single in recent years, obtaining top five placements in Australia, Canada, Germany, Ireland, New Zealand, the U.S. and the UK. This marks their highest charting single in the United Kingdom to date. It has also peaked at number 2 on the US Billboard Hot 100, matching their highest peak of \"Apologize\" in 2007."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"Sariola is a female fronted extreme dark metal band from Germany consisting of an international line-up featuring members from Germany, Ukraine and Belarus. Sariola was founded by E.Konny and Anagnorisis in the year 2005. E.Konny already played black metal-based music with clear, operatic vocals in his former bands Divina Nocturna / Spectra Selene (1997\u20132004). After a short time, Silenia Tyrvenis, singer of E.Konny's former project, joined Sariola. The Band started immediately the recording of their first album, entitled \"Sphere of Thousand Sunsets\". Due to personal reasons Silenia Tyrvenis left the band. After several line up changes, a new line up crystallized: Loreley Von Rhein - vocals, Leandra Ophelia Dax - keyboards, Anagnorisis - lead guitars, Morbid - drums, Sturm - rhythm guitars. Following by live concerts and open air festivals with bands like [:SITD:], Ensiferum, Psyche, Pro-Pain, Imperia, Hail of Bullets, Sariola offered live performance on the stages of Europe. In May 2009 SARIOLA released an EP entitled \"Deathfrozen Silence\" containing an early version of four songs from the upcoming album \"From The Dismal Sariola\". The musical mixture of the EP improves the typical elements of SARIOLA and gained positive reviews by international press. As result of a demand, Sariola completely re-recorded their first album \"Sphere Of Thousand Sunsets\" with the new line-up without using any original tracks. The worldwide internet release was in May 2012. The next album of Sariola was scheduled according to the interview for Swedish \"Battle Helm\"-Zine for winter 2012/2013 After major line up changes Sariola produced their very first music video to the song \"From the dismal Sariola\". The song itself was recorded in multiple studios. Anagnorisis went to the parlour studios (where bands like Napalm Death an the Exploited produced their work) in Kettering, UK to record guitars. The track was mastered by Russ Russell. 2 further tracks where recorded in L\u00FCbeck, Germany at Lasse Lammert's LSD studio. The EP \"From the dismal Sariola\" released in September 2014 by the German label 7HARD received good critics and the band perform their first European tour supporting the NWOBHM pioneers Blitzkrieg and performed several headliner shows."@en ;

The group consists of members Olga Seryabkina, Polina Favorskaya, and Dasha Shashina. Serebro was formed in 2007 as a submitted proposal for consideration by Channel One Russia for the Eurovision Song Contest 2007. Serebro was selected to represent Russia at the 2007 Contest with the song titled \"Song #1\". They subsequently placed third at the contest, scoring a total of 207 points. Serebro was then officially signed to Fadeev's record label Monolit Records, and in 2012, the group had additional releases produced by Sony Music Entertainment and Ego Music. During 2009, member Marina Lizorkina announced her departure from the group; she was subsequently replaced by Anastasia Karpova. With Lizorkina at the time, the band recorded their debut studio album OpiumRoz. The album received critical acclaim and spawned other singles in addition to \"Song #1\", but it never became a commercial success. The band's second album, called Mama Lover, proved to be much more successful. It included the massive hit of the same name and went double platinum in Russia. The eponymous \"Mama Lover\" hit single received media attention worldwide, with reviewers commenting on both the raunchy music video and the song itself. The music video for the song received more than 20 million views on YouTube and became the subject of more than 250 parodies. After the success of \"Mama Lover\", the group began to garner commercial attention around the world. The group re-released Mama Lover in Japan (under the name Serebration) after signing a contract with EMI Music. Their first international single under Ego Music and Universal Music Group, \"Mi Mi Mi\", became a success on European music charts. In late September, member Anastasia Karpova announced her departure from the group in order to pursue a solo career and was replaced with new member, named Dasha. After their musical and image development, the group became known for a very sexually charged and over the top style. Some of their music videos have led to controversy in the media, including \"Mama Lover\" and \"Mi Mi Mi\"."@en ;

dbr:The_Monterays	rdf:type	dbo:Band ;
	dbo:abstract	"The Monterays, featuring the distinctive vocals of Dan Elliott, are the longest working band in Upstate New York. Formed in 1962, The Monterays were well established on the Syracuse scene in the 1960s, and after a decade layoff in the 1970s, continue to play over 100 dates a year. The band was formed in East Syracuse, New York in 1962 by Jack Abert (bass guitar/Hawaiian guitar), John Wisnewski (guitar/vocals), Larry Landry (rhythm guitar) and Jack Holton, who was soon replaced by Tommy Forrest (drums/lead vocals). Early inspirations were The Beach Boys, surf music and the theatrics of East Syracuse's first rock and roll band, The Sabres, featuring the talented lead guitarist Ron Lauback. The Monterays developed a loyal following with Syracuse teenagers, so much so that they found themselves at Riposo Studios in the fall of 1964 to wax their first single, the Beatles meets Beach Boys original \"Bye Bye\", and the Larry Santos penned \"Sheryl-ane\". (\"Sheryl-ane\" was also recorded by Utica, New York act The Madisons for MGM Records in 1965)After this single came and went, The Monterays signed a management deal with \"Dandy\" Dan Leonard, a popular disc jockey for WNDR (1965). He was able to arrange another recording sessions for the band, this time in New York City, which resulted in the Larry Santos penned \"I'll Be Around\" on the A side, with the Madisons on side B. The single was released on the Twin Hit label, and went on to sell 500 copies in Upstate New York. At this point Landry and Forrest departed (both joined the military) and were replaced by Dan Elliott (n\u00E9e Rubado) (lead vocals)and Dave Moziak (rhythm guitar) (ex-The Dimensions) and drummer Dave Usiatynski (Tommy Forrest took up the lead vocal duties for another popular Syracuse band The Saint and the Sinners also featuring guitarist Ron Lauback). This is the version of The Monterays that created the most buzz around New York State. Things seemed to be looking up, Dan Leonard booked them into various clubs and live functions (scoring a major coup by getting the band an opening slot on the Beach Boys concert at the Syracuse War Memorial in July 1966. The third single \"Very Last Day\"/\"You Belong To My Heart\" (Sahara Rec. #118) was released in late 1966 and sold about as well the last one. The Monterays scored another coup by wooing away keyboardist George Day from The Saint and the Sinners just in time to record their fourth single \"If Wishes Were Horses\"/\"Conquistador\". The single was recorded again at Riposo Studios, produced by Dan Leonard and the A side featured Thomas Bacon on French Horn. Released on the tiny Buff Records label, \"If Wishes Were Horses\" (Buff # 323681) took off regionally, and The Monterays soon found themselves on A&M Records's radar. A&M ultimately passed, preferring to sign the band Procol Harum instead (\"Conquistador\" was written by Procol Harum members Brooker/Reid but recorded by The Monterays first). Without the promotional support of a major label, \"If Wishes were Horses\" peaked at ##88 on the Cashbox charts in October 1968. By this time, The Monterays (Elliott/Abert/Moziak/Wisnewski/Usiatynski/Day) were now a seven piece, with Tommy Forrest returning on vocals. Unfortunately, family and outside interests began to tear the band apart, and The Monterays split in 1969. Dan Elliott resurfaced with the rock band Wilksbury Brigade, before joining The Glenn Miller Orchestra in 1973. A year later, he joined The Belmonts (of Dion and the Belmonts fame) and continues to perform with them. George Day opened Dayson Studios, recording many top Upstate New York musicians from 1970-1987. George Day also became involved with Ron Wray who curated the Syracuse area artists rock and roll album series in the 1970s and '80s. Tommy Forrest remained active as well, fronting local act The Seven into the early 70s. In 1978, The \"Wishes\"-era Monterays reformed for a one off show at The Beginning club in Syracuse NY to over two thousand people. But after Dan Elliott left California after finishing work on H.B. Halicki's film The Junkman, he reformed The Monterays permanently. Now called Dan Elliott and the Monterays, they've been a mainstay on the Syracuse scene since, recording a single for the Belmonts-owned AIR Records label (\"Stay Awhile\"/\"Ruby Baby\" 1983), and winning a SAMMY (Syracuse Area Music Awards) lifetime achievement award in 1996. The group has undergone some major changes in recent years, with the departures of Jack Abert in 2002 (Jack stayed on as executive producer and live sound mixer), George Day in 2004, and Dave Moziak in 2005. Ron Lauback joined the band in 2002 first as a replacement for Jack Abert, then switching to lead guitar in 2005 with the departure of Dave Moziak. His son Ronnie Dark was added on drums in 2003. Other members in the 2000s included Rob Medugno on keyboards (2005\u20132007), Brian Carr (bass/vocals 2005-2011), and Wayne Muller (keyboards 2007\u2013present). Founding member Jack Abert died on August 16, 2009 in Florida. Longtime bassist Brian Carr departed in October 2011. The band has reshuffled their line-up again with Ronnie Dark taking over bass guitar duties. Ron's first replacement on drums, Teddy O Ted Boileau left in August 2012. The current line-up is Dan Elliot, Ron Lauback, Ronnie Dark, Wayne Muller and Dave Miller, another former member of the group. 2012 marks The Monterays' 50th year in the music business."@en ;

Achieving both critical acclaim and commercial success, the duo helped popularize the Dirty South style of hip hop in the 1990s while developing distinctive personas and an idiosyncratic sound that incorporated genres such as funk, psychedelia, techno, and gospel. After forming the group as high school students in 1992, Outkast released their debut album Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik (1994), which gained popularity after the single \"Player's Ball\", reached number one on the Billboard Hot Rap Tracks chart. With successive releases including ATLiens in 1996, Aquemini in 1998 and Stankonia in 2000, Outkast continually experimented and developed their music. In 2003, the duo released the double album Speakerboxxx/The Love Below, which featured the number one singles \"Hey Ya!\" and \"The Way You Move\". Speakerboxxx/The Love Below won the Grammy Award for Album of the Year in 2004, the first and only for a hip hop group. Outkast next created the soundtrack for the 2006 musical film Idlewild, which they starred in. Since 2007, Outkast has been on hiatus and both members have pursued their solo careers, although the group moved to Epic Records in September 2011. In 2014, Outkast reunited to celebrate their 20th anniversary by performing at more than 40 festivals worldwide in 2014, beginning at the Coachella Festival in April. The duo is one of the most successful hip-hop groups of all time, having received six Grammy Awards. Between six studio albums and a greatest hits release, Outkast has sold over 25 million records. Meanwhile, they have garnered widespread critical acclaim, with publications such as Rolling Stone and Pitchfork Media listing albums such as Aquemini and Stankonia among the best of their era."@en ;

The band was founded by Morten Harket (vocals), Magne Furuholmen (keyboards) and P\u00E5l Waaktaar-Savoy (guitars). The group initially rose to fame during the mid-1980s after being discovered by musician and producer John Ratcliff, and had continued global success in the 1990s and 2000s. A-ha achieved their biggest success with their debut album, Hunting High and Low, in 1985. That album peaked at number 1 in their native Norway, number 2 in the UK, and number 15 on the US Billboard album chart; yielded two international number-one singles, \"Take On Me\" and \"The Sun Always Shines on TV\"; and earned the band a Grammy Award nomination as Best New Artist. In the UK, Hunting High and Low continued its chart success into the following year, becoming one of the best-selling albums of 1986. In 1994, after their fifth studio album, Memorial Beach, failed to achieve the commercial success of their previous albums, the band went on a hiatus. Following a performance at the Nobel Peace Prize Concert in 1998, the band returned to the studio and recorded their sixth album, 2000's Minor Earth Major Sky, which was another number-one hit in Norway and resulted in a new tour. A seventh studio album, Lifelines, was released in 2002, and an eighth album, Analogue, in 2005, was certified Silver in the UK \u2013 their most successful album there since 1990's East of the Sun, West of the Moon.

The album peaked at number 2 in Norway (their first release not to reach number 1 in their home territory). On 15 October 2009, the band announced they would split after a worldwide tour in 2010, the Ending on a High Note Tour. Thousands of fans from at least 40 different countries on six continents congregated to see A-ha for the last leg of the tour. On 4 December 2014 A-ha officially announced its participation at Rock In Rio 2015 which celebrated 30 years for both the band and the event.

The band has sold more than 100 million records worldwide (till 2009). In less than a year, during 2010, the band earned an estimated 500 million Norwegian Kroner from concert tickets, merchandise and the release of a greatest hits album, making them one of the 40\u201350 largest grossing bands in the world."@en ;

dbr:Aerosmith	rdf:type	dbo:Band ;
	dbo:abstract	"Aerosmith is an American rock band, sometimes referred to as \"the Bad Boys from Boston\" and \"America's Greatest Rock and Roll Band.\" Their style, which is rooted in blues-based hard rock, has come to also incorporate elements of pop, heavy metal, and rhythm and blues, and has inspired many subsequent rock artists. The band was formed in Boston, Massachusetts in 1970. Guitarist Joe Perry and bassist Tom Hamilton, originally in a band together called the Jam Band, met up with vocalist/pianist/harmonicist Steven Tyler, drummer Joey Kramer, and guitarist Ray Tabano, and formed Aerosmith. In 1971, Tabano was replaced by Brad Whitford, and the band began developing a following in Boston. They were signed to Columbia Records in 1972, and released a string of gold and platinum albums, beginning with their 1973 eponymous debut album, followed by Get Your Wings in 1974. In 1975, the band broke into the mainstream with the album Toys in the Attic, and their 1976 follow-up Rocks cemented their status as hard rock superstars. Two additional albums followed in 1977 and 1979. Their first five albums have since attained multi-platinum status. Throughout the 1970s, the band toured extensively and charted a dozen Hot 100 singles. By the end of the decade, they were among the most popular hard rock bands in the world and developed a loyal following of fans, often referred to as the \"Blue Army\". However, drug addiction and internal conflict took their toll on the band, which led to the departures of Perry and Whitford in 1979 and 1981, respectively; they were replaced by Jimmy Crespo and Rick Dufay. The band did not fare well between 1980 and 1984, releasing the album Rock in a Hard Place, which was certified gold but failed to match their previous successes. Perry and Whitford returned to Aerosmith in 1984 and the band signed a new deal with Geffen Records. After a comeback tour, the band recorded Done with Mirrors (1985), which won some critical praise but failed to come close to commercial expectations. It was not until the band's collaboration with rap group Run\u2013D.M.C. in 1986, and the 1987 multi-platinum release Permanent Vacation, that they regained the level of popularity they had experienced in the 1970s. In the late 1980s and 1990s, the band scored several hits and won numerous awards for music from the multi-platinum albums Pump (1989), Get a Grip (1993), and Nine Lives (1997), and embarked on their most extensive concert tours to date. The band also became a pop culture phenomenon with popular music videos and notable appearances in television, film, and video games. Their comeback has been described as one of the most remarkable and spectacular in rock 'n' roll history. Additional albums followed in 2001, 2004, and 2012. Since 2001, the band has toured every year except 2008. After 46 years of performing, the band continues to tour and record music. Aerosmith is the best-selling American hard rock band of all time, having sold more than 150 million records worldwide, including over 70 million records in the United States alone. With 25 gold albums, 18 platinum albums, and 12 multi-platinum albums, they hold the record for the most total certifications by an American group and are tied for the most multi-platinum albums by an American group. The band has scored 21 Top 40 hits on the Billboard Hot 100, nine number-one Mainstream Rock hits, four Grammy Awards, six American Music Awards, and ten MTV Video Music Awards. They were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2001, and were included among both Rolling Stone's and VH1's lists of the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time. In 2013, the band's principal songwriters, Tyler and Perry, were inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame."@en ;

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alabama_(band)>	rdf:type	dbo:Band ;
	dbo:abstract	"Alabama is an American country, Southern rock and bluegrass band formed in Fort Payne, Alabama in 1969. The band was founded by Randy Owen (lead vocals, rhythm guitar) and his cousin Teddy Gentry (bass guitar, background vocals), soon joined by their other cousin, Jeff Cook (lead guitar, fiddle, keyboards). First operating under the name Wildcountry, the group toured the Southeast bar circuit in the early 1970s, and began writing original songs. They changed their name to Alabama in 1977 and following the chart success of two singles, were approached by RCA Records for a record deal. Alabama's biggest success came in the 1980s, where the band had over 27 number one hits, seven multi-platinum albums and received numerous awards. Alabama's first single on RCA Records, \"Tennessee River\", began a streak of number one singles, including \"Love in the First Degree\" (1981), \"Mountain Music\" (1982), \"Dixieland Delight\" (1983), \"If You're Gonna Play in Texas (You Gotta Have a Fiddle in the Band)\" (1984) and \"Song of the South\" (1987). The group's popularity waned slightly in the 1990s, although they continued to receive hit singles and multi-platinum record sales. Alabama disbanded in 2006 following a farewell tour and two albums of inspirational music, but reunited in 2011 and have continued to record and tour worldwide. The band's blend of traditional country music and Southern rock combined with elements of gospel, and pop music gave it a crossover appeal that helped lead to their success. They also toured extensively and incorporated production elements such as lighting and \"sets\" inspired by rock concerts into their shows. The band has over 30 number one country records on the Billboard charts to their credit and have sold over 75 million records, making them one of the world's best-selling bands of all time. AllMusic credited the band with popularizing the idea of a country band, and wrote that \"it's unlikely that any other country group will be able to surpass the success of Alabama.\""@en ;
