The song was also recorded by Eric Burdon and The Animals, Otis Redding, Ike and Tina Turner, Rod Stewart and The Supremes (album: We Remember Sam Cooke). Redding's version was elected to the \"500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll \" by the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum. In 1966, the British TV show Ready Steady Goes Live (the live version of Ready Steady Go!), devoted a whole programme to a live performance by Redding, who regularly covered many of Cooke's songs. One of the highlights was a version of \"Shake\" on which Redding was joined by Eric Burdon and Chris Farlowe. The song was covered by the Small Faces. It was a prominent part of their early live repertoire and featured as the opening track on their debut album Small Faces, and re-released on the Decca Anthology collection. The Norwegian group, Public Relations, covered the song in Oslo in 1967. It was released on the single HMV 45-AL 6145. The song was also covered by Censored and formed part of their distinct early sound. The song was sampled by rapper, Game on his 2011 album, The R.E.D. Album."@en ;

According to King, the song title is derived and was inspired by a spiritual composition by Sam Cooke called \"Stand by Me Father\" (although Mike Stoller has stated differently). This spiritual was sung by The Soul Stirrers with Johnnie Taylor singing lead. There have been over 400 recorded versions of \"Stand by Me\" performed by many artists. The song has been featured on the soundtrack of the 1986 film Stand by Me. In 2012 it was estimated that the songs royalties had topped \u00A317 million, making it the sixth highest earning song as of that time. 50% of the royalties were paid to King. In 2015, King's original version was inducted into the National Recording Registry by the Library of Congress for being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\", just under five weeks before King's death. Later in the year the 2015 line up of The Drifters covered the song in tribute to King."@en ;

The track takes its name from the analogue electronic musical instrument, the stylophone, which is used extensively on the track. The main version includes a sample of \"Oh L'amour\" performed by Dollar, while the \"Bigpipe Style\" version (which features the main riff played on bagpipes) samples Suzi Quatro's hit \"Devil Gate Drive\". Orbital's request to use a sample from a Rolf Harris stylophone demonstration disc was turned down. The other versions are \"Old Style\", a more club-oriented dance mix; and \"New Style\", a retro-styled version with live bass by Andy James. All of the mixes are by Orbital themselves; the duo had wanted Stereolab to remix the track, but the latter group were on tour at the time and unavailable, so the \"New Style\" mix is Orbital's own version of a Stereolab-type mix. Two other tracks were included on the single.

	dbo:abstract	"\"Surreal\" (stylized as \"SURREAL\") is a song by Japanese recording artist Ayumi Hamasaki, taken from her third studio album Duty (2000). It was written by Hamasaki and produced by Max Matsuura. The song is a rock with elements of alternative rock. \"Surreal\" describes Hamasaki's madness and sense of confusion, while the themes of \"Surreal\" are based on Hamasaki's concept of loneliness, chaos, confusion, and the burden of her responsibilities, aimed mostly towards her public image as an recording artist. It was released as the fourth single from the album on 27 September 2000 by Avex Trax and Avex Taiwan. Critical reception towards \"Surreal\" has been positive; majority of the critics commended the song writing and musical delivery, and highlighted it as an album and career stand out track. In Japan, \"Surreal\" became her sixth number one on the Oricon Singles Chart, and also reached the top spot on the Japanese Count Down TV chart. \"Surreal\" was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of Japan (RIAJ) for shipments of 250,000 units. Released as a DVD Single in December 2000, it reached number three on the Oricon DVD Chart. The accompanying music video was directed by Wataru Takeishi, featuring Hamasaki walking along a beach front. With mysterious lighting hovering over several objects, she enters a jungle-like room to find a clone of herself; the clone wears the same outfit for the Duty and \"Surreal\" photo shoot. \"Surreal\" has been included on several concert tours and New Year Countdown shows held and hosted by Hamasaki, and has featured on majority of her greatest hits compilations."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This)\" is a song written and performed by the British new wave music duo Eurythmics. The song is the title track of their album of the same name and was released as the fourth and final single from the album in early 1983. The song became their breakthrough hit, establishing the duo worldwide. Its striking music video helped to propel the song to number 2 on the UK Singles Chart and number 1 on the US Billboard Hot 100. It was the first single released by Eurythmics in the US. \"Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This)\" is arguably Eurythmics' signature song. Following its success, their previous single, \"Love Is a Stranger\", was re-released and also became a worldwide hit. On Rolling Stone's The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time issue in 2003, \"Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This)\" was ranked number 356. Eurythmics have regularly performed the song in all their live sets since 1982, and it is often performed by Lennox on her solo tours. In 1991, the song was remixed and reissued to promote Eurythmics' Greatest Hits album. It re-charted in the UK, reaching number 48, and was also a moderate hit in dance clubs. Another remix by Steve Angello was released in France in 2006, along with the track \"I've Got a Life\" (peaking at number 10)."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"Sweet Dreams\" is a song by American singer and songwriter Beyonc\u00E9 from her third studio album I Am... Sasha Fierce (2008). Originally titled \"Beautiful Nightmare\", it leaked online in March 2008. The song was written and produced by Knowles, James Scheffer, Wayne Wilkins, and Rico Love. Columbia Records released \"Sweet Dreams\", the album's sixth single, to mainstream radio and rhythmic contemporary radio playlists in the United States on June 2, 2009, and elsewhere on July 13. It is an adventurous song composed in a synthpop arrangement and its instrumentation includes synthesizers, a keyboard, and snare drums. Knowles employs slinky vocals to sing the haunting lyrics, which describe a romantic relationship that the female protagonist believes could be a dream. \"Sweet Dreams\" was critically acclaimed by contemporary music critics, who praised its beats, synthpop sound and Knowles' vocals. Some critics noted that the sliding bassline gave the song a dark quality and resembles the one used in some of Michael Jackson's songs on Thriller (1982). \"Sweet Dreams\" gained popularity for its electro music style, which contrasts Knowles' earlier R&B, urban, and funk-tinged releases. The song was nominated for the Viewers Choice Award at the 2010 BET Awards. It topped the New Zealand Singles Chart, peaked at number ten on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart, and reached the top five on singles charts in Australia, the Czech Republic, Ireland, Slovakia, and the United Kingdom among others. \"Sweet Dreams\" was certified platinum in Australia, New Zealand and the US. The song's accompanying music video was directed by Adria Petty, and was filmed in Brooklyn, New York. It mainly uses a green screen and computer-generated effects, making the clip minimal and performance-based. The video sees Knowles wearing a golden robot suit designed by French fashion designer Thierry Mugler. The video received favorable reviews from critics, who described it as high-fashion and noted that Knowles reprised part of the choreography from her 2008 video for \"Single Ladies\". Knowles promoted the song by performing it live at the 2009 MTV Europe Music Awards and occasionally during the I Am... World Tour (2009\u201310). \"Sweet Dreams\" was recognized as one of the most performed songs of 2009 at the 27th American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers (ASCAP) Pop Music Awards. It was used in a Cryster Geyser Water Japanese advertisement that featured Knowles."@en ;

The song was released digitally for free on July 21, 2014 through the cable network Adult Swim's 2014 weekly singles series. The release of \"The Clarity\" also marks the first release of newly recorded material in almost 20 years. The writing sessions for what would become Jerusalem and Dopesmoker began around 1995, despite being released in 1999 and 2003 respectively. Sleep reformed in 2009 and began performing live in addition to writing new riffs for future songs \"sporadically\". Adult Swim approached the band about releasing a new song as a part of its weekly singles series, and Sleep wrote \"The Clarity\" in \"a couple days\" separate from the other new material it had been working on. The band also commented that the song, \"is an exercise in musical stream of thought, as all proper music should be\" and that the lyrics are a \"follow-up to a lifetime of marijuana enjoyment.\" \"The Clarity\" was generally well received by music critics. Writing for NPR, Lars Gotrich wrote: \"It captures Sleep at its heaviest and weediest, and despite the puff of smoke that pervades these 10 minutes, it's the band's cleanest-sounding recording.\" Colin Joyce writing for Spin wrote: \"Built, like many of the band's best tracks, around Cisneros' thunderous, distorted basslines and the bleary haze of Pike's Tony Iommi indebted guitar snarls, 'The Clarity' hearkens straight back to the drone-y, stone-y tunes that the band was working on when they were teenagers.\" Writing for Exclaim!, Josiah Hughes wrote: \"'The Clarity' is a heavy journey through meaty riffs, mid-tempo drums and plenty of drug references. At 10 minutes in length, it's also a perfect song to turn on and zone out to.\""@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"The Saint\" is a 1997 single by Orbital, taken from the soundtrack to the film of the same name. The track is an updated version of Edwin Astley's theme music from the 1960s TV series The Saint and plays over a scene towards the end of the film. Orbital's arrangement alters the piece from waltz time to common time and places the melody on top of a driving electronica rhythm. The B-side, \"The Sinner\", is an original composition developing elements of Orbital's arrangement from the A-side. \"The Saint\" was one of Orbital's biggest hit singles. It reached number 3 in the UK singles chart, equalling their highest ever placing in that chart achieved by \"Satan Live\". Despite its success, it is not included on any of Orbital's retrospective albums, though it did appear on some reissues of their 1996 album In Sides. It was included in Orbital's live set during Lollapalooza 1997 and that year's Phoenix Festival but has not been played live since."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"Today\" is a song by American alternative rock band The Smashing Pumpkins, written by lead vocalist and guitarist Billy Corgan. The song, though seemingly upbeat, contains dark lyrics. Corgan wrote the song about a day in which he was having suicidal thoughts, exemplified by the reference to self-mutilation in the chorus. The contrast between the grim subject matter of the song and the soft instrumental part during the verses, coupled with use of irony in the lyrics, left many listeners unaware of the song's tale of depression and desperation. The song alternates between quiet, dreamy verses and loud choruses with layered, distorted guitar similar to the noisy guitar rock of My Bloody Valentine. \"Today\" was released in September 1993 as the second single from the band's second album and major label debut, Siamese Dream. Although Corgan opted for \"Cherub Rock\", the lead single from the album, to be the opening track, \"Today\" and its follow-up \"Disarm\" are credited in AllMusic for popularizing the band and \"sen[ding] [Siamese Dream] into the stratosphere\". \"Today\" has been generally well received by critics; a Blender article described it as having \"achieved a remarkable status as one of the defining songs of its generation, perfectly mirroring the fractured alienation of American youth in the 1990s.\""@en ;

The song was released on June 12, 2011 by Mercury Nashville Records, as a promotional single to accompany the documentary television series Why Not? with Shania Twain (2011). The song marked Twain's first song release in over six years. Twain wrote the track for self-inspiration, during the development of Why Not? with Shania Twain. To her, \"Today Is Your Day\" became the theme song for the series, expressing the purpose behind it via music. Despite feeling apprehensive, Twain decided to record the track, which induced her to create her forthcoming fifth studio album. The track is midtempo ballad in the country pop genre. Lyrically, \"Today Is Your Day\" regards personal upliftment. \"Today Is Your Day\" is Twain's first piece of music to have had no involvement with now ex-husband Robert John \"Mutt\" Lange in 18 years. \"Today Is Your Day\" has received mixed reviews from music critics and mild commercial performance in Canada and the United States. On the Canadian Hot 100, the song peaked at number 16, while, in the US Billboard Hot 100, it peaked at number 66. It became Twain's first effort to enter the main-genre chart since \"Party for Two\" (2004).

	dbo:abstract	"\"Trouble\" is a song recorded by British recording artist Leona Lewis and American entertainer Childish Gambino for Lewis' third studio album, Glassheart (2012). Inspired by Lewis' break-up with childhood sweetheart Lou Al-Chamaa, \"Trouble\" is a mid-tempo R&B and trip hop ballad, with a piano and strings-driven melody. It was written by a British writing collective consisting of Lewis, Donald Glover, Hugo Chegwin, Harry Craze, Shahid Khan, James Murray, Mustafa Omer, Emeli Sand\u00E9 and Fraser T Smith. Production came courtesy of Khan under his production name of Naughty Boy and Smith, along with co-producer Chris Loco and additional producer Jahlil Beats. Music critics noted that the urban production marked a new direction for Lewis, particularly by featuring Gambino during the song's middle eight breakdown with a poetic rap verse. A version excluding Gambino is also included on Glassheart. \"Trouble\" was also influenced by British trip hop duo Massive Attack, who Lewis cited an a musical inspiration. Lewis' falsetto and soprano vocal performance on the song garnered early praise from critics who commended the raw emotions, as well as Gambino's guest rap and the song's melodic strings- and piano-heavy production. \"Trouble\" premiered on 21 August 2012 on BBC Radio 1's Breakfast with Scott, ahead of its release as Glassheart's lead single, superseding the 2011 single \"Collide\", a collaboration with Swedish DJ and record producer Avicii. \"Trouble\" was released on 5 October 2012, preceding the album by one week, and entered the UK Singles Chart at number seven becoming Lewis's ninth top-ten single. In Ireland \"Trouble\" charted at number twenty-one becoming Lewis's eighth top-thirty single. As part of promotion of the song, fans were given chance to produce their own remix of \"Trouble\" which was released alongside the single on Lewis' official music store. An accompanying music video was filmed on 22 August in Los Angeles, with Teen Wolf actor Colton Haynes cast as Lewis' love interest.

	dbo:abstract	"\"West Coast\" is a song recorded by American singer and songwriter Lana Del Rey for her third studio album, Ultraviolence (2014). Written by Del Rey and Rick Nowels, it is a melancholy love song that depicts a woman torn between love and ambition, while also serving as a dedication to the West Coast of the United States. A psychedelic rock, soft rock and surf rock ballad, \"West Coast\" was noted to be an evolution and more guitar-orientated in sound for Del Rey and was produced by Dan Auerbach of The Black Keys. Described as a two-in-one song, its shifting tempo transitions downward by nearly 60 beats per minute at the chorus, in a rhythmical shift reminiscent of The Beatles' \"And I Love Her\" (1964) and \"We Can Work It Out\" (1965). In the song, Del Rey's vocal comprises a more sensual and sinister tone than in her previous discography, and are often sung in an anxious \"breathy\" style. Following its release as the lead single from the album on April 14, 2014, \"West Coast\" received universal acclaim from music critics who commended its unconventional composition and Del Rey's uncharacteristic vocal delivery. Several news media sources went on to list it as one of the best songs of 2014, including Consequence of Sound, NME and Spin. \"West Coast\" debuted at number 17 on the Billboard Hot 100, marking Del Rey's highest debut and second highest-charting single of her career, while also becoming her first single to enter the Rock Airplay chart where it reached number 26. The song marked Del Rey's eighth top 40 hit on the UK Singles Chart where it peaked at number 21. An accompanying black-and-white music video, directed by Vincent Haycock, was released on May 7, 2014. Shot at Marina del Rey, California and Venice, Los Angeles, it uses a minimalist and melancholy approach to depict Del Rey torn between two love interests, one of which is portrayed by Hollywood tattoo artist Mark Mahoney. The clip was well received by critics and was nominated for a 2014 MTV Video Music Award for Best Cinematography. Del Rey promoted \"West Coast\" with live performances at the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival, Austin City Limits Music Festival and Glastonbury Festival 2014. The song has also been covered by James Vincent McMorrow and Royal Blood."@en ;

It was written by Tommy Durden and Mae Boren Axton. A newspaper article about the suicide of a lonely man who jumped from a hotel window inspired the lyrics. Axton presented the song to Presley in November 1955 at a country music convention in Nashville. Presley agreed to record it, and did so on January 10, 1956, in a session with his band, the Blue Moon Boys, the guitarist Chet Atkins, and the pianist Floyd Cramer. \"Heartbreak Hotel\" comprises an eight-bar blues progression, with heavy reverberation throughout the track, to imitate the character of Presley's Sun recordings. The single topped Billboard's Top 100 chart for seven weeks, Cashbox's pop singles chart for six weeks, was number one on the Country and Western chart for seventeen weeks and reached number three on the R&B chart, becoming Presley's first million-seller, and one of the best-selling singles of 1956. \"Heartbreak Hotel\" achieved unheard of feats as it reached the top 5 of Country and Western, pop, and Rhythm 'n' Blues charts simultaneously. It would eventually be certified double platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America. Presley had first performed \"Heartbreak Hotel\" during a live show in December 1955 during a tour of the Louisiana Hayride, but the song gained strong popularity after his appearance on Stage Show in March 1956. It became a staple of Presley's repertoire in live appearances, last performed by him on May 29, 1977 at the Civic Center in Baltimore, Maryland. In 1995 \"Heartbreak Hotel\" was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame, and in 2004 Rolling Stone magazine named it one of the \"500 Greatest Songs of All Time\". That year it was also included in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's \"500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll\". A rock and roll standard, since its original release \"Heartbreak Hotel\" has been covered by several rock and pop acts, including Willie Nelson and Leon Russell, who recorded a duet version that topped the Country charts in 1979."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"Booty\" is a song recorded by American entertainer Jennifer Lopez for her eighth studio album, A.K.A. (2014). It was written and produced by Cory Rooney, Lopez, and Benny Medina, with additional writing from Chris Brown, Asia Bryant, Pitbull, Diplo, Lewis D. Gittus, Tedra Renee Wilson, and Danny Omerhodic. \"Booty\" samples \"Dat a Freak\", a song by Diplo and Swick, and it features Lopez's frequent collaborator Pitbull. It was released as the third single from the album on September 23, 2014. Initially entitled \"Big Booty\", the song was first rejected by Lopez who did not like the idea of having a song with a title like that. However, after playing the demo for her kids, they enjoyed the track and Lopez was convinced to record the track. \"Booty\" is a dance track, with middle eastern vibe, heavy percussion and Oriental keyboard riff, while its lyrics portrait Lopez inviting girls to the dancefloor to have a good time and dance, while shaking their buttocks. The song received generally favorable reviews from music critics, with many complimenting the song's fun nature, the dance environment and Pitbull's appearance, but a few dismissed its concept. Commercially, \"Booty\" performed moderately worldwide. It became a top twenty hit in the United States, charting at number eighteen on the US Billboard Hot 100, and entered the top forty in Canada, Australia and New Zealand, among other music markets. \"Booty\" was first premiered during a listening party Lopez threw for critics, later she performed a snippet of the track during a concert and eventually premiered it full at an Orchard Beach concert. She has also performed \"Booty\" on Good Morning America and at Fashion Rocks. A one-minute teaser clip for the track was released on June 13, 2014, and it features Lopez and a group of women twerking. The teaser-video received high praise for its visuals and choreography, while Lopez was complimented by critics for looking rejuvenated and younger. Booty serves as the 7th out of 8 collaborations of Lopez and Pitbull, in lined with Fresh Out The Oven in 2009, On The Floor in 2011, Dance Again in 2012, Live It Up in 2013, We Are One (Ole Ola) in 2014 with Claudia Leitte, on Prince Royce's single Back It Up in 2015 where both Lopez and Pitbull was featured and a song entitled Drinks For You (Ladies Anthem) from Pitbull's Global Warming album in 2012. Lopez and Azalea also previously collaborated on the track Acting Like That which was included in her A.K.A. album. \"Booty\" was officially remixed with vocals from Australian rapper Iggy Azalea, replacing those of Pitbull. The remix received generally positive reviews from critics, who commended Azalea for adding an explosive verse to the song. The music video for the remix was shot in Los Angeles in late August, and was directed by Hype Williams. It premiered on September 18, 2014, and it shows Lopez and Azalea dancing in revealing swimming costumes, before being drenched with water. Lopez and Azalea performed \"Booty\" for the first time together on live television at the American Music Awards on November 23, 2014."@en ;

As Duffy's first international release, the song is credited with firmly establishing her career and is now considered her signature song. \"Mercy\" received comparisons to Duffy's previous single, \"Rockferry\". Critical reviewers of \"Mercy\" noted similarities between the song to releases by Aretha Franklin, Dusty Springfield and The Supremes, as well as contemporaries such as fellow British singer Amy Winehouse. \"Mercy\" peaked at number one on the UK Singles Chart in February 2008, remaining at the top of the chart for five weeks. The single also topped the charts in Austria, Germany, Greece, the Netherlands, Norway, Republic of Ireland, Switzerland and Turkey, and peaked within the top five of the charts in Belgium, Denmark, France, Italy, Japan, New Zealand, Romania, Spain and Sweden. \"Mercy\" was nominated for several awards in 2008, including the Grammy Award for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance at the 51st Grammy Awards. Well received by the public, \"Mercy\" went on to become the third-best-selling single of 2008 in the United Kingdom, with sales of over 500,000 copies in the UK that year. The song achieved worldwide chart success, with Duffy attributing this to the fact that \"everyone is searching for liberty ... from themselves or from the world they\u2019ve created around them\" and \"everyone would like to be set free\". It is Duffy's best-selling single to date. The song has been covered several times since its original release, most notably by the cast of American musical television series Glee as well as by both The Fratellis and OneRepublic on BBC Radio 1's Live Lounge.

The song's production was handled by Lifted, with additional production from West, Mike Dean and Mike Will, and additional instrumentation from Hudson Mohawke.

The song peaked at number 13 on the US Billboard Hot 100 and hit number one on both the US Billboard Hot Rap Songs and Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs charts. The song has since been certified triple Platinum for three million digital sales, and has sold over two million copies in the US as of October 2012. A music video directed by Australian director Nabil Elderkin was released on June 6, 2012. The highly-stylized video shows a long take of all four rappers featured on the song, along with other GOOD Music recording artists such as Cyhi the Prynce, Kid Cudi, Mr. Hudson and Teyana Taylor in cameos. The video features the rappers giving their verses and dancing around, with deliberate editing to make it appear as if they are disappearing and reappearing behind walls. The video received positive reviews from critics. West performed his portion of the song at the 2012 Watch the Throne Tour, and 2 Chainz, Pusha and Big Sean performed the track during Sean's setlist at the 2012 Summer Jam festival.

It was released as the third single from the album in Europe, on March 20, 1998 by Columbia Records. Similar to the treatments of \"Butterfly\" and \"Breakdown\", \"The Roof\" received a limited worldwide release due to Carey's conflict at the time with Sony. The song was written and produced by Carey and Trackmasters, and is built around a sample from \"Shook Ones part II\" by Mobb Deep. The song's lyrics recount an intimate roof-top encounter between lovers, and how the memory affects the protagonist. The extended remix features a rap verse by Mobb Deep; both versions were well received by contemporary music critics. In the music video, Carey is seen in a limousine recounting an encounter she shared on a rainy night. Additionally, past scenes of the event are shown, with Carey caressing her lover at a roof-top party. During the videos climax, Carey open the limousines sun-roof and stands in the rain, trying to recapture the moments she shared in the rain. Aside from the Japanese concerts, Carey performed the song live during her Butterfly World Tour in 1998. Due to the song's limited release, \"The Roof\" did not chart in most major music markets, with the exception of The Netherlands and the United Kingdom, where it peaked at numbers 63 and 96, respectively.

In the United Kingdom, it was marketed as a double A-side single, along with \"Shame for You\". While the melody incorporates a sample of Sandie Shaw's \"Puppet on a String\", the lyrics directly describe Allen's real life younger brother, actor Alfie Allen, criticising him for his lazy behaviour. Contemporary critics gave the song mixed reviews, some complimenting the production, while others considered it fell flat as the album's last song. The single peaked inside the top 20 of the charts in New Zealand and on the UK Singles Chart, where it became her third single to do so. The accompanying music video portrayed Allen's brother as a puppet while the storyline follows the lyrical meaning of the song. The song was performed live by Allen during her 2007 concert tour, as part of the encore."@en ;

All I Wanna Do was the first in 13 consecutive Dance Chart number ones for Minogue, stretching between 1997-2015 with Summer of Love. \"All I Wanna Do\" marked a significant change in Minogue's career and image, as did her album Girl from which it was taken. Her image had become highly sexualised, culminating in her nude calendar photo shoot and the suggestive videos and album artwork which accompanied her new releases. This was also the first release on Minogue's new record deal with Warner Bros. Records. The multimillion-dollar deal initially looked set to launch her career worldwide, especially with the success of \"All I Wanna Do\".

	dbo:abstract	"\"All Together Now\" is a song by Liverpudlian baggy band The Farm from their album Spartacus, and links some of the band's favourite themes: socialism, brotherhood and football. Peter Hooton wrote the lyrics in his early 20's after reading about the extraordinary events on the Western Front during Christmas 1914 - it is fundamentally a song about peace and reconciliation. No Mans Land ( 6 verses) was recorded for a John Peel session in the 1980s but in 1990 Peter wrote the chorus after Steve Grimes suggested putting lyrics of No Man's Land to the music of Pachelbel's Canon. To shorten the song for radio Suggs (original producer in 1990) decided to lose the last 3 verses. It has been used by numerous football teams since. Hooton has quoted \"The unauthorised spontaneous truce 100 years ago was a unique act of humanity amidst the horrors of trench warfare. A triumph of humanity over conflict. There are numerous accounts of British and German troops greeting each other, conversing, swapping presents and even playing football in No Man\u2019s Land on Christmas Day 1914. On some parts of the front the \u2018truce\u2019 lasted several days and in some instances well into January as soldiers on both sides were reluctant to resume the fighting.\" Peter Hooton explained \u2018there is a lot of debate about the causes of the First World War, who was to blame and emphasis on the horrors and futility of the tactics employed but we would like people to concentrate on this incredible moment when ordinary soldiers came together. This event should be cherished and publicised as an incredibly unique moment in the history of conflict throughout the ages.\u2019"@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"Anyway, Anyhow, Anywhere\" was a single released by The Who in 1965.

The song was composed by lead singer Roger Daltrey and guitarist Pete Townshend, the only time they wrote together. The guitar feedback, although not the first to be heard on a record (see The Beatles' \"I Feel Fine\"), is thought to be the first solo with feedback. This is the first Who release with Nicky Hopkins playing piano. Townshend: \"I wrote the first verse and Roger helped me with the rest. I was inspired by listening to Charlie Parker, feeling that this was really a free spirit, and whatever he'd done with drugs and booze and everything else, that his playing released him and freed his spirit, and I wanted us to be like that, and I wanted to write a song about that, a spiritual song.\" The song was rarely played live for most of The Who's career, but since 1999 has become a staple for their live shows; it appears on the album Live at the Royal Albert Hall.

We carried on writing the lyrics later, using experiences we'd had, wandering around New York at two in the morning, the worse for wear, and being excited by the dangers, but also being a bit naive.

On 8 July 2014, the song impacted on mainstream radio stations in the US as the fifth single from The New Classic and the accompanying music video for the song was released on 13 August 2014.

It has also reached number four in the UK and number fifteen in Australia. Initially a track recorded by Perry for her fourth studio album, Prism (2013), the song was excluded from its tracklisting, however Perry handed the demo to Azalea for her to complete. \"Black Widow\" has been described as \"channeling the trap\" genre, containing an ominous steel drum rhythm, heavy bass and a sparse beat. Its composition has been the subject of music critics' comparisons to Perry's \"Dark Horse\". Other journalists, praised its beat and Azalea and Ora's vocals. \"Black Widow\" charted due to strong digital sales during the debut week of The New Classic.

	dbo:abstract	"\"Blessed\" is an English language hit single by Lebanese-German singer Fady Maalouf. Maalouf was a contestant in 2008 of Deutschland sucht den Superstar, the German version of Pop Idol. He sang the song for the first time on 17 May 2008 in the finals of the said competition as the \"winner's song\" in case he won the competition. He eventually came second (runner up) to winner Thomas Godoj. \"Blessed\" also appears in Fady Maalouf's debut album also entitled Blessed. Even though Fady Maalouf did not win the title, his extraordinary voice and his charming personality had, by then, won him the hearts of an enormous fan base, which then, in an unprecedented effort, bombarded Sony BMG with letters, mails and phone calls, all demanding the same - the release of Fady Maalouf\u2019s title \"Blessed\", performed by him during the final show. After a contract with Columbia, a subsidiary of Sony BMG Music Entertainment \"Blessed\" was released on 4 July 2008 as a single and went straight to no. 2 in the German single charts. \"Blessed\" was written for Fady Maalouf by J\u00F6rgen Elofsson and Peer \u00C5str\u00F6m, a songwriter team of international standing, who have worked with such names as Kelly Clarkson, Leona Lewis, Madonna, Britney Spears, Cyndi Lauper, Il Divo, and especially C\u00E9line Dion. The song is produced by Alex Christensen, who has worked with artists such as Justin Timberlake, Tom Jones, Paul Anka or Michael Bolton. The album, also named Blessed including 14 tracks, saw the light on 25 July 2008, and went as well straight to no. 2 in the German album charts. These simultaneous single and album charts positions made Maalouf the most successful DSDS finalist of all time."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"Blow\" is a song by American recording artist and songwriter Kesha from her first extended play (EP), Cannibal (2010). The song was released on February 8, 2011. It was written by Kesha, along with Klas \u00C5hlund, Lukasz Gottwald, Allan Grigg, Benjamin Levin and Max Martin, with production done by Dr. Luke, Max Martin, Benny Blanco and Kool Kojak. According to Kesha the song's lyrics are representative of herself and her fans. \"Blow\" is dominantly an electropop and dance-pop song and is described as a party anthem as it portrays a simple message of having a desire to have a good time at a club. Critical reception of \"Blow\" has been generally positive, with most critics praising the song's hook, opening, and party anthem vibe, though some found the chorus uninspiring and ordinary. Kesha's vocal work throughout the song was met with mixed reaction: some critics felt that she was both sassy and brash, while other critics felt that her personality was missing from the song. Commercially, \"Blow\" reached the top ten in the Billboard Hot 100 in the United States and Australia, becoming her sixth consecutive top-ten hit in both countries as a solo artist. The song also reached the top ten in New Zealand, and the top 20 in Canadian Hot 100 in Canada. The song's accompanying music video was directed by Chris Marrs Piliero and was released February 25, 2011. The video co-stars actor James Van Der Beek, who plays Kesha's nemesis. Piliero and Kesha came up with the video's concept and is intended to be simplistic, a video that is cool and random. Reception of the video by critics were positive, with the mid-video dialogue scene's humor being highlighted."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"Boulevard of Broken Dreams\" is a song by American punk rock band Green Day, recorded for their seventh studio album American Idiot (2004). Reprise Records released \"Boulevard of Broken Dreams\" as the second single from American Idiot. The song's lyrics were written by lead singer Billie Joe Armstrong, and composed by the band. Production was handled by Rob Cavallo and Green Day. \"Boulevard of Broken Dreams\" remains one of Green Day's signature songs. The song speaks from the point of view of American Idiot's main character, Jesus of Suburbia, and is a moderate midtempo song characterized by somber and bleak lyrics. This is in contrast to the previous track on the album, \"Holiday\", which illustrates Jesus of Suburbia's high of being in The City. MTV's Green Day Makes a Video described \"Holiday\" as a party, and \"Boulevard of Broken Dreams\" as the subsequent hangover. The song was ranked the number one on Rolling Stone's Reader's Choice: Singles of the Decade list in 2009 and number 65 on the 100 Best Songs of the Decade list in the same year. It has sold over 2 million copies in the United States as of 2010. The single peaked at number two in the United States, making it Green Day's most successful song. The song was the ninth biggest selling single of the 2000-2009 decade with worldwide sales exceeding 5 million copies. \"Boulevard of Broken Dreams\" won the Grammy Award for Record of the Year."@en ;

The song was released as a digital download on April 11, 2006, as the album's fourth single and was serviced to contemporary hit radio in the United States on May 8, 2006. \"Buttons\" uses strong elements of Middle Eastern music in its production. Lyrically, the song involves Scherzinger speaking of a woman's desire to be undressed. Critics were divided on \"Buttons\" with some complimenting the song's production, however, others criticized it followed the same formula of their previous singles. The song reached the top-five in countries such as Australia, Germany, and the United Kingdom. The song reached number one in Austria and in New Zealand, where it became their fourth consecutive number one single on the chart. It peaked at number three on the US Billboard Hot 100 and sold over two million copies in the United States, making The Pussycat Dolls the first female group in digital history to have three singles pass the two million mark in digital sales. The sepia-toned music video directed by Francis Lawrence features The Pussycat Dolls in various dance sequences. Other scenes include Scherzinger by herself singing the verses. Since its release, \"Buttons\" has become a staple in Scherzinger's live performances. It was part of the set lists of the group's two major tours, PCD World Tour (2006\u201307), Doll Domination Tour (2009) and Scherzinger's own Killer Love Tour (2012).

This single is cited as David Bowie's official North American debut, despite the fact that the song \"The Man Who Sold the World\" was released in North America two years prior. This was the last song Bowie performed live on stage before his retirement from live performances at the end of 2006.

	dbo:abstract	"\"Cloud Nine\" is a 1968 hit single recorded by The Temptations for the Motown label. It was the first of their singles to feature Dennis Edwards instead of David Ruffin in the lineup, was the first of producer Norman Whitfield's psychedelic soul tracks, and won Motown its first Grammy Award. The song was written by Whitfield and former Motown artist Barrett Strong. In 1968, psychedelic rock band Sly & the Family Stone had a hit with their single \"Dance To The Music\", and Temptations member Otis Williams introduced Norman Whitfield to the band's music. At first, Whitfield didn't want to produce anything with such a radically different sound. \"I don't want to get into all that crazy shit,\" he said. \"That ain't nothing but a little passing fancy.\" Within a few weeks, however, he had created the backing tracks for the newest Temptations single, a psychedelic-styled number called \"Cloud Nine\", and stuck primarily to such songs well into the early 1970s. Featuring all five Temptations trading lead vocals \u00E0 la The Family Stone, \"Cloud Nine\" was a marked departure from the standard Tempts sound: wah-wah guitars and a harder, driving beat propelled the record, as opposed to pianos and strings. The song also features the Cuban percussionist Mongo Santamaria on conga drums. Edwards, Eddie Kendricks and Paul Williams swap leads on the verses, bridges and choruses, such as this example from the first bridge: Otis Williams has some brief lead lines on the last half of the song (i.e.: he repeats \"Reality\u2026\"), and Melvin Franklin also gets a line near the end (\"There's no difference between day and night\u2026\"). The lyrics for the song were about the struggles and pains of living poor, as opposed to being about relationship and love troubles. The broke, unemployed, and despondent main character in the song proclaims that he gets over all of his problems by \"riding high on 'cloud nine'\". This has been interpreted by many (including Motown head Berry Gordy) as a reference to drug abuse, although Whitfield, Strong, and The Temptations deny that \"Cloud Nine\" is about drugs. \"Cloud Nine\" won Motown its first Grammy Award in 1969 for Best Rhythm & Blues Group Performance, Vocal or Instrumental, reached #2 in the U.S. R&B chart and #6 in the U.S. Pop chart, and led the way for the Temptations' full-blown venture into psychedelia, with increasingly eclectic and socio-political-themed records, including \"Runaway Child, Running Wild\", \"Psychedelic Shack\", and \"Ball of Confusion (That's What the World Is Today)\", following within the coming two years."@en ;

The song reached number 9 on the UK Singles Chart. \"Condemnation\" is a gospel-esque song with a rock twist. The 7\" version is the \"Paris Mix\", with female backing vocals added and an emerging drum beat scheme. Band members indicated that this song normally would have been sung by Martin Gore, but Dave Gahan insisted on singing it instead. Gahan voted for \"Condemnation\" to be the first single for Songs of Faith and Devotion, but lost. The B-sides are remixes of \"Death's Door\" and \"Rush\", and some live tracks from the Devotional Tour. \"Death's Door\" was a song from the 1991 Until the End of the World soundtrack. The original version is still exclusive to that CD, recorded only by Martin Gore and Alan Wilder after the World Violation Tour was over. The music video for \"Condemnation\" was directed by Anton Corbijn and was shot in Hungary.

The song was written by Knowles, Terius Nash, Shea Taylor, Ester Dean, Cainon Lamb, Julie Frost, Michael Bivins, Nathan Morris and Wanya Morris, and produced by Beyonc\u00E9, Taylor and Lamb. The song's conception was brought about by Knowles desiring to mix musical styles of the 1990s with the 1970s. It was sent to radio on October 4, 2011 as the fourth single from 4. Featuring a sample of \"Uhh Ahh\" by Boyz II Men, \"Countdown\" incorporates aspects of hip hop, funk, reggae and world music. According to the lyrics, the female protagonist delivers a message of monogamy for her lover, celebrating self-worthiness as well as appreciating him. The song received rave reviews from critics, who were surprised by its maturity and compared it to Beyonc\u00E9's earlier solo work and with Destiny's Child. The song finished second in 2011's Pazz & Jop critics' poll and was included on the list of the year's best songs by various critics and publications including Spin, Rolling Stone and The Guardian. Following the leak of 4 in early June 2011, \"Countdown\" received minor rotation on radio that attributed to its debut at number 75 on the US Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart, where it peaked at number 12. It also peaked at number 71 on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart and number one on the US Hot Dance Club Songs chart. It has been certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). \"Countdown\" peaked at number 35 on the UK Singles Chart and number nine on the UK R&B Chart. Adria Petty directed the accompanying music video, which was recorded whilst Knowles was pregnant in August 2011. The music video sees Beyonc\u00E9 incorporate a mix of classic and modern dances, with references to pieces like that of Audrey Hepburn's appearance in Funny Face. Although well received by critics, the video faced controversy for the use of choreography from Anne Teresa De Keersmaeker's 1983 ballet Rosas danst Rosas. Beyonc\u00E9 performed \"Countdown\" on her 4 Intimate Nights with Beyonc\u00E9 and Revel Presents: Beyonc\u00E9 Live residency shows, and included it as a video interlude on The Mrs. Carter Show World Tour."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"Dreams\" is the debut single by English singer-songwriter Gabrielle. Written by Gabrielle and Tim Laws and produced by Richie Fermie, it reached number one on the UK Singles Chart for three weeks in June 1993. The single entered the UK chart at number 2, which was the highest chart entry a debut act ever scored in the UK at that time. The song also peaked at number 26 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart in the US and at number-one on the Billboard Hot Dance Club Play chart. In Australia, the song made number two on the ARIA Charts. Originally the song included a sample of the song \"Fast Car\" by Tracy Chapman, but because of copyright reasons the sample had to be removed. This single is seen as her signature song and the title of her greatest hits compilation Dreams Can Come True, Greatest Hits Vol. 1 is drawn from its lyrics. The song was later sampled by the More Fire Crew on their 2002 single \"Dreams\". The song is featured heavily in the 1999 Paul Thomas Anderson film Magnolia, where the character 'Quiz Kid' Donnie Smith plays the song repeatedly as a motivational aid. It is also used in the trailer for the 2000 film Purely Belter."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"Enola Gay\" is an anti-war song by the British synthpop group Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark (OMD). It was the only single from the band's 1980 album, Organisation. Written by Andy McCluskey, it addresses the atomic bombing of Hiroshima on 6 August 1945, during the final stages of World War II, and directly mentions three components of the attack: the Boeing B-29 Superfortress Enola Gay, which dropped the nuclear weapon Little Boy on Hiroshima at \"8:15\". \"Enola Gay\" has come to be regarded as one of the great pop songs. Critic Ned Raggett in AllMusic lauded the track as \"astounding...a flat-out pop classic \u2013 clever, heartfelt, thrilling, and confident, not to mention catchy and arranged brilliantly\"; colleague Dave Thompson called it a \"perfect synth-dance-pop extravaganza.\" It featured in MusicRadar's \"The 40 Greatest Synth Tracks Ever\" in 2009, who noted that the song \"includes some of the biggest synth hooks of all time.\" In 2012, NME listed the track among the \"100 Best Songs of the 1980s\", describing McCluskey's vocal as \"brilliantly quizzical\" and the song as a \"pop classic\". It was selected by the BBC for use during the opening ceremony of the 2012 Summer Olympics in London. When released as a single, \"Enola Gay\", was misperceived by listeners with little knowledge of the Hiroshima bombing as a cryptic identification of the band as homosexual; the track was banned from being played on popular BBC1 programme Swap Shop for fear that it would serve as a corrupting sexual influence on children. Nevertheless, it was an enormous success, going on to sell more than 5 million copies internationally. The song was a hit in many countries, topping the charts in France, Italy and Portugal. It was a sleeper hit in OMD's native UK: the track entered the UK Singles Chart at number 35, but climbed 27 places over the next 3 weeks to reach a peak of number 8, thus becoming the group's first Top 10 hit in their home country."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"Entangled\" is a song by Genesis, recorded in November 1975 at Trident Studios, London for inclusion on the album A Trick of the Tail. It is the second track on the album, featuring 12-string acoustic guitars. Written by keyboardist Tony Banks and guitarist Steve Hackett, the song tells the story of an unpleasant period of illness and the horrors of a psychiatric hospital. The song ends with a sequence featuring a solo blending the ARP 2600 synthesizer and the choir section on Tony Banks' Mellotron. According to Banks, \"Entangled\" was a combination of a song fragment that Hackett had written in 6/8 but didn't yet have a chorus or a definitive direction, with a previously unused piece of music Banks had written that was also in 6/8. Banks and Hackett put the two pieces together, and had drummer, vocalist Phil Collins sing what Banks' original piano part had been. Said Banks, \"It produced what is probably my favourite track on that album, ending with a great cathedral-type feeling.\" The song was performed live during the 1976 A Trick of the Tail Tour. A live performance of this song, filmed in Glasgow, is included in the 2007 Remaster DVD. In an interview on 11 December 2013 with classic rock music journalist Ray Shasho of examiner.com, Steve Hackett said this about the origin of \"Entangled\"... Ray Shasho states \"One of my favourite Genesis albums is \u2026A Trick of the Tail (1976) which was the first release without original frontman Peter Gabriel. I had surgery and a two week stint in the hospital a few years back and a song that came into my mind during that time was \u201CEntangled.\u201D Was being in the hospital the premises of the song?\"Steve Hackett replied... \u201CIt was really the psychiatrist couch. Whether you place it in a hospital or somewhere else, it was the idea of drifting in and out of consciousness. I remember when I first had the lyric ready and I showed it to Phil who was going to sing it and he said this has got a Mary Poppins feel to it \u2026 Over the Rooftops and Houses. Indeed, the whole world of Disney cartoons and the attendant music was a huge influence on Genesis. Certainly throughout the '70s, beyond that \u2026 possibly less so for them, but then I really shouldn't comment on what they did post Gabriel and post me.\u201D The musical arrangement of the song was the blueprint for the Elbow song \"Newborn\"."@en ;

Lyrically, \"First Love\" talks about finding true love and wishing you would have met the person you're with now years ago, so they can be your first love. The song received positive reviews from most music critics, who commended the track for lifting the bar for high-quality pop music, while also praising its \"fun and free feel\".

George Harrison handles the verses, and there are also two excellent bridges featuring Roy Orbison and Bob Dylan.

It was released on June 30, 1990, by Sire Records as the album's second and final single. Written and produced by Madonna and Patrick Leonard, the song was developed from a line in the parent film, Dick Tracy, talking about a woman who enjoys being spanked by her partner. Performed in an almost comical style, \"Hanky Panky\" is a jazz and swing song with a changing bassline and minor to major key-shift in the chorus. It caused some controversy in Ireland because of its innuendo and racy lyrics, with women's groups deeming them as harmful; Madonna later clarified that the lyrics were intended as a joke. The song garnered positive response from music critics, many of them highlighting its lyrical content. It was a moderate success, becoming a top-ten hit in many countries including Australia, Ireland, Italy, the United Kingdom and the United States, while topping the chart in Finland. Madonna has performed the song on two of her concert tours; on the 1990 Blond Ambition World Tour, and 14 years later on the Re-Invention World Tour.

The video was filmed on September 28, 2005, at the Van Andel Arena in Grand Rapids, Michigan. It reached number one on Billboard's Hot Modern Rock Tracks chart and is the band's biggest international hit. As in many Mezmerize/Hypnotize songs, guitarist Daron Malakian accompanies Serj Tankian in the vocal sections. Serj and Daron perform a harmony in the refrain before and after the instrumental bridge. The combination of the two vocalists gives the song a vocal range, with Serj handling the lower verses and Daron handling the higher verses.Musically, \"Hypnotize\" changes modes in several places. The opening guitar riff and early verses are an upbeat melody that switches between the I (melodic) and V (Hindu) modes of F# melodic minor. The later riffs and the outro to the song are in the more commonly heard VI (natural) mode of F# minor. This mixing of modes creates the song's characteristic psychedelic feeling. The Eastern-themed instrumental bridge contains at least four overdubbed clean guitar tracks and a well-crafted, syncopated rhythm. The song leads up to a massive crescendo, then ends with a repeated portion of the opening riff with soft singing by Malakian."@en ;

The song was written in Los Angeles after \"a couple of gross guys wolf-whistled\" at the lead singer, Hooper, while she was walking down the street. It became the band's fifth top twenty single in Australia, peaking at number sixteen and also was featured on the Australia/New Zealand soundtrack of the 2004 film Spider-Man 2. The music video was directed by Michael Spiccia in Sydney, Australia, featured scenes from the Spider-Man 2 2004 film and was released to Australian music channels on 3 July 2004. The band's bass player/co-writer of the song, Warren Jenkin, states \"the video is a destroyed New York street scene, after Doc Ock and Spider-Man have had a fight. The whole thing is totally demolished, and there's lots of Marvel comic skyscraper-style backdrops, which looks fantastic. It really looks like it's in New York.\" Columbia Tristar Films' Suzanne Stretton-Brown states \"We were thrilled to have a rare opportunity to support an Australian band on the Spider-Man 2 soundtrack and when we heard Killing Heidi's new single 'I Am' we were astonished by how beautifully their lyrics seemed to capture the emotion of the character Peter Parker in the new movie. The song expresses an isolation that mirrors Spider-Man's lonely quest and burning inner conflict in the continuing story.\" \"I Am\" became an instant hit upon its release in July 2004, debuting at #16 on the official ARIA Charts and remaining in the top 50 for almost three months, eventually selling over 35,000 copies and achieving Gold status. It was the first time Killing Heidi had been in the charts since 2002's Present album, and the song served to introduce to the public the band's new image, both musically and physically."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"It's Like That\" is a song by American singer-songwriter Mariah Carey for her tenth studio album, The Emancipation of Mimi (2005). Written by Carey, Jermaine Dupri, Manuel Seal, and Johnt\u00E1 Austin, and produced by Carey, Dupri, and Seal, the song borrows the hook \"It's Like That Y'all\" from the Run\u2013D.M.C. tracks \"Hollis Crew\" (1984) and \"Here We Go (Live)\" (1983). \"Stay the Night\", \"Say Somethin'\" and \"Shake It Off\" were all contenders for the lead single. However, plans were changed when Island Def Jam Music head L.A. Reid suggested to Carey she record a few more strong songs to ensure the album's success, therefore \"It's Like That\" was written and chosen as the album's lead-single, being released on January 7, 2005. \"It's Like That\" is a hip-hop song featuring ad-libs by the song's producer Jermaine Dupri and Fatman Scoop, while its lyrics discuss about a celebration, free of stress, strife and sadness, where Carey's alter-ego \"Mimi\" is being emancipated. The song received generally favorable reviews from music critics, most of whom noted its catchiness and carefree message. It was also nominated for a 2006 Grammy Award for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance. Commercially, the song charted well worldwide, becoming a top twenty hit in several countries, including the United States, while peaking inside the top-ten in over five other countries. The song's music video, directed by Brett Ratner, was filmed as a two-part story with \"We Belong Together\", featuring Carey at her bachelorette party, while getting ready to marry Eric Roberts and falling in love with a party guest and ex-lover, played by Wentworth Miller. The song was heavily promoted by the singer in a number of places, such as The Ellen DeGeneres Show, Good Morning America, BET, VH1 and more, while being performed on both her The Adventures of Mimi and Angels Advocate Tour."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"It's Like That\" is a song by American hip hop group Run\u2013D.M.C. It was first released in 1983 on a cassette backed with the track \"Sucker M.C.'s\". The release marked the start of Run-D.M.C.'s career and is widely regarded as ushering in a new school of hip hop artists with a street image and an abrasive, minimalist sound that marked them out from their predecessors. Both tracks were collected on the trio's eponymous debut album in 1984. \"It's like That\" is about life in the area where the group lives (unemployment, prices, death, etc.). Despite protesting those social and political problems, the song takes on a hopeful message encouraging listeners to abandon prejudice and to believe in themselves. In 2001, parts of the song was sampled in Jagged Edge's \"Let's Get Married (Remix)\" featuring Run-D.M.C.. The single was an international success. The song was remixed by house DJ Jason Nevins in 1997. His remix, originally a bootleg, was picked up for official release in 1997, and became a sleeper hit in 1998. It sold around five million copies worldwide, placing it amongst the biggest selling singles of all time, although Nevins was only paid some $5,000 for his remix.

The song was written by Maya \"M.I.A.\" Arulpragasam, Dave \"Switch\" Taylor and Bappi Lahiri and produced by Switch and M.I.A.. A cover of \"Jimmy Jimmy Jimmy Aaja\" from the film Disco Dancer (1982), the song was re-arranged as an uptempo pop-electro tune with disco influences by modifying the orchestration, instrumentation and beats and the addition of original English lyrics for the single. During the recording and production sessions, M.I.A. and Switch wanted to create a dance-pop disco record using a song that the singer was familiar with from her childhood; the song's lyrics portray M.I.A. being invited by British journalist Ben Anderson on a date while covering a genocide tour across nations in Africa, and both eventually pursuing a romantic relationship. \"Jimmy Jimmy Jimmy Aaja\" was itself inspired by \"T'es OK /(You're OK for international markets)\" (1980) from French Euro disco group Ottawan. Following the moderate chart performance of \"Boyz\", \"Jimmy\" was released in Japan in July 2007 as the album's lead single, and the second single in other countries. XL Recordings distributed \"Jimmy\" in CD single, 7\" and 12\" formats in the UK on 10 November 2007, however the song leaked in the country prior to release while the singer was on tour. Despite this, the song topped the UK Indie Chart and charted in Greece and Japan where it was a major commercial success. The single began to gain traction on the US Billboard Hot Dance Club Songs chart, peaking at number twenty eight following nine weeks on the chart. \"Jimmy\" was well received by contemporary music critics, who cited its distinct 1970s style pop sound compared with most songs featured on the album, and complimented its hook and lyrical themes. The bassline has similarities with the hook of Blur's hit single \"Girls & Boys\". Stylus magazine placed \"Jimmy\" at number 5 on their list of the \"Top 50 Songs of 2007\"."@en ;

The instrumental version of the song was first offered to Michael Jackson before Madonna both accepted it and wrote the lyrics and melody. \"La Isla Bonita\" is noted for being the first Madonna song to have a Latino influence in it, with arrangements of Cuban drums and Spanish guitar, maracas, harmonicas and a mix of synthesized and real drumming. The lyrics of the song tell about a beautiful island and was a tribute to the beauty of the Latin people according to Madonna. Following its release, \"La Isla Bonita\" received positive appreciation from critics. It also achieved worldwide popularity, topping the record charts in countries such as Austria, Canada, France, Germany and Switzerland. It became Madonna's fourth number-one single in the United Kingdom, giving her the record for most number-one singles among female artists. In the United States, it reached number four on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. In the accompanying music video, Madonna portrayed two opposite characters \u2013 a pious girl and a passionate Latina. The Latin style and the flamenco red dress she wore became a trend later. The song is one of the most performed live songs by Madonna, appearing in six of her world tours, the most recent being on the Rebel Heart Tour (2015\u201316). Madonna has regularly performed the song in its Spanish form, sometimes with tribal or folk songs and remixes to accompany it. The song has been covered by a number of artists including Mexican recording artist Byanka (1988) and French recording artist Aliz\u00E9e for her album Psych\u00E9d\u00E9lices (2008)."@en ;

dbr:Like_a_Rolling_Stone	rdf:type	dbo:MusicalWork ;
	dbo:abstract	"\"Like a Rolling Stone\" is a 1965 song by the American singer-songwriter Bob Dylan. Its confrontational lyrics originated in an extended piece of verse Dylan wrote in June 1965, when he returned exhausted from a grueling tour of England. Dylan distilled this draft into four verses and a chorus. \"Like a Rolling Stone\" was recorded a few weeks later as part of the sessions for the forthcoming album Highway 61 Revisited. During a difficult two-day preproduction, Dylan struggled to find the essence of the song, which was demoed without success in 3/4 time. A breakthrough was made when it was tried in a rock music format, and rookie session musician Al Kooper improvised the organ riff for which the track is known. However, Columbia Records was unhappy with both the song's length at over six minutes and its heavy electric sound, and was hesitant to release it. It was only when a month later a copy was leaked to a new popular music club and heard by influential DJs that the song was put out as a single. Although radio stations were reluctant to play such a long track, \"Like a Rolling Stone\" reached number two in the US Billboard charts (number one in Cashbox) and became a worldwide hit. Critics have described the track as revolutionary in its combination of different musical elements, the youthful, cynical sound of Dylan's voice, and the directness of the question \"How does it feel?\" \"Like a Rolling Stone\" transformed Dylan's image from folk singer to rock star, and is considered one of the most influential compositions in postwar popular music. Rolling Stone magazine listed the song at number one in their \"500 Greatest Songs of All Time\" list. The song has been covered by numerous artists, from The Jimi Hendrix Experience and The Rolling Stones to The Wailers and Green Day. At an auction in 2014, Dylan's handwritten lyrics to the song fetched $2 million, a world record for a popular music manuscript."@en ;

The video for \"Mandinka\" was shown heavily after debuting 24 January 1988 in 120 Minutes on MTV. The single was a mainstream pop hit in the UK, peaking at #17 in the singles chart, #6 in her native Ireland, #24 in The Netherlands, #26 in Belgium, #18 in New Zealand and #39 in Australia. The single was a big college radio hit in the US. In 1988, O'Connor sang \"Mandinka\" on Late Night with David Letterman, in what was her first US network television appearance. Sin\u00E9ad also sang the song live at the 1989 Grammy Awards. In an interview in The Tech, 12 April 1988, O'Connor said: \"Mandinkas are an African tribe. They're mentioned in a book called Roots by Alex Haley, which is what the song is about. In order to understand it you must read the book.\"In the song Mandinka O\u2019Connor sings \"I don\u2019t know no shame, I feel no pain/I can\u2019t see the flame,\" she sings, this to let the listeners know her main point behind the song.

The song was thought of by Sermon after buying a copy of Gaye's Midnight Love and the Sexual Healing Sessions album, which overlook some of the original album's earlier mixes. After listening to an outtake of Gaye's 1982 album track, \"Turn On Some Music\" (titled \"I've Got My Music\" in its initial version), Sermon decided to mix the vocals (done in a cappella) and add it into his own song. The result was similar to Natalie Cole's interpolation of her father, jazz great Nat \"King\" Cole's hit, \"Unforgettable\" revisioned as a duet. The hip hop and soul duet featuring the two veteran performers was released as the leading song of the soundtrack to the Martin Lawrence & Danny DeVito comedy, \"What's the Worst That Could Happen?\" The song became a runaway success rising to #2 on Billboard's R&B chart and was #1 on the rap charts. It also registered at #21 pop giving Sermon his highest-charted single on the pop charts as a solo artist and giving Gaye his first posthumous hit in 10 years following 1991's R&B-charted single, \"My Last Chance\" also bringing Gaye his 41st top 40 pop hit. There is also a version that's played on Adult R&B stations that removes Erick Sermon's rap verses. The song was featured in the 2011 Matthew McConaughey film The Lincoln Lawyer."@en ;

It was released as a single in January 2013, two months before the band's sixth album Sakanaction. A progressive dance rock song, \"Music\" was adopted as the theme song for the Y\u014Dsuke Eguchi-starring drama Dinner while the band's songwriter Ichiro Yamaguchi was struggling to write lyrics for the otherwise finished composition. Inspired by the cooking drama's theme of professionalism, Yamaguchi themed the song around his own experience with professionalism, relating it to his career as a musician. The band performed the song at several high-profile venues, including NHK's Music Station and at the 64th K\u014Dhaku Uta Gassen New Year's musical competition. Critics believed the composition was different structurally to a regular pop song, and challenged general notions about what constituted pop music, and was a high quality song, despite the single's apparent commercial-focus.

	dbo:abstract	"\"Nature Boy\" is a song first recorded by American jazz singer Nat King Cole. It was released on March 29, 1948, as a single by Capitol Records, and later appeared on the album, The Nat King Cole Story. The song was written in 1947 by eden ahbez and is partly autobiographical. It is a tribute to ahbez's mentor Bill Pester, who had originally introduced him to Naturmensch and Lebensreform philosophies, which ahbez practised. When Cole was performing in 1947 at the Lincoln Theater, ahbez wanted to present the song to him, but was ignored. He left the copy with Cole's valet, and from him the singer came to know of \"Nature Boy\". After receiving appreciation for his performance of the song, Cole wanted to record it. The recording took place on August 22, 1947, and featured an orchestra conducted by Frank De Vol\u2014the in-house arranger of Capitol Records. He used strings and flute as instrumentation in the song, to capture the \"enchanting\" vibe of the track. The lyrics are a self-portrait of ahbez and his life. The final line\u2014\"The greatest thing you'll ever learn, Is just to love and be loved in return\"\u2014is considered a poignant moment in the song, with multiple interpretations of it. \"Nature Boy\" was released amidst the American Federation of Musicians (AFM) ban of 1948, but became commercially successful, reaching the top of the Billboard music charts and selling over a million copies. Receiving critical acclaim also, \"Nature Boy\" helped to introduce Cole to a wider audience, especially the white music market, and generated royalties for ahbez. In 1999, the song was awarded the Grammy Hall of Fame Award. However, \"Nature Boy\" was also the subject of lawsuits, with Yiddish composer Herman Yablokoff claiming that it was plagiarized from his song \"Shvayg mayn harts\" (\"Hush My Heart\"), which he wrote for his play Papirosn (1935). In the end, ahbez and Yablokoff settled out of court. Following Cole's success with the song, rival record companies released cover versions of \"Nature Boy\" by other artists like Frank Sinatra and Sarah Vaughan, which were also successful. It ultimately became a pop and jazz standard, with many artists interpreting the song, including Tony Bennett and Lady Gaga, who recorded it for their jazz collaborative album, Cheek to Cheek (2014). It was also used in numerous films like The Boy with Green Hair, The Talented Mr. Ripley and the 2001 musical, Moulin Rouge!, for which singer David Bowie recorded a techno version."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"Never Say Never\" is a song by Canadian recording artist Justin Bieber. The song is used as the theme song for The Karate Kid, and features rap interludes from the film's star, Jaden Smith. It was originally a risque demo with sexual lyrics performed by American singer Travis Garland, it was written and produced by The Messengers, and Omarr Rambert. However, for unknown reasons, Bieber was tapped to record the song for the film. He re-wrote the song with The Messengers, Rambert, Smith, and his vocal producer Kuk Harrell, to feature inspirational lyrics to foil the film's theme. The song contains R&B and pop elements while merging hip-hop. The song was released for digital download in the United States on June 8, 2010. The song was later included as an acoustic track on the remix album My Worlds Acoustic (2010) and both the acoustic and single versions were on the compilation album My Worlds: The Collection (2010). To promote Bieber's 3D concert film of the same name, the song was released as the lead single and the only single from Bieber's second remix album, Never Say Never: The Remixes. \"Never Say Never\" peaked within the top twenty in Canada, Norway, and New Zealand, while reaching the top forty in Australia, as well as charting in other international markets. After it was re-released as the lead single and the only single from \u2013 The Remixes, promoting his film, the single peaked at number eight on the Billboard Hot 100, becoming Bieber's second top-ten single in the United States. Its accompanying music video, directed by Honey, features Smith and Bieber in a recording studio playing around and dancing, and is intercut with scenes from the film. He has notably performed the song on Today and on his My World Tour. Smith joined Bieber during the tour's stop at Madison Square Garden to perform the song for scenes in Justin Bieber: Never Say Never."@en .

Upon release \"Only\" received generally positive reviews from critics, who praised Minaj's rapping technique, however some critics felt the song was not her strongest. Commercially the song was a success in the United States; \"Only\" peaked at number 12 on the US Billboard Hot 100 and number one on the US Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart, giving Minaj her fourth number one and making her the only female rap artist to do so. The song was certified triple platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). The song received a nomination for Best Rap/Sung Collaboration at the 58th Grammy Awards. The song was supported with the release of both a lyric video and an official video. The lyric video was released in November 2014, premiering close to the 25th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall, with visualizations inspired by the Nazi Regime and the work of Leni Riefenstahl. There was immediate backlash from fans, calling the video anti-semitic and insensitive, although Minaj stated she was not involved in the production of the lyric video and said she regrets not overseeing it before it was posted to YouTube. The song accompanying music video was released the following month and was directed by Hannah Lux Davis; it premiered on December 12, 2014."@en ;

Williams described this single as \"One of the best, so much better than Angels\".[citation needed] Music critic Joe Garvey said \"Love it!\" in music magazine NME.[citation needed] According to his home page, at the very last second, Williams changed his mind and made this his single. This explains why the video is a little uncohesive and mostly a performance shoot. Williams has stated that the song was inspired by Kate Moss, giving way to the opening line \"I know a freaky young lady name of cocaine Katie\" (the line is changed to \"no shame Katie\" on the single version). After a few relatively unknown songs parallel to Gary Barlow's career and \"South of the Border\" failing, many thought this was the end of Williams."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"Stay\" is a song recorded by Barbadian singer Rihanna for her seventh studio album, Unapologetic (2012). It features guest vocals by Mikky Ekko, and was released as the second single from the album on January 7, 2013. \"Stay\" was co-written by Ekko and Justin Parker. The song's lyrical content speaks of temptation and the inability to resist true love. Music critics were generally positive in their opinion regarding the balladry, with most describing it as a standout track on the album, though a few labeled it as boring. Upon the release of Unapologetic, \"Stay\" charted on multiple charts worldwide. Following its release as a single, it reached number one in Bulgaria, Canada, the Czech Republic, Denmark and Israel and the top five in twenty-four countries worldwide including Australia, France, Germany, New Zealand, Norway, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. It peaked at number three on the US Billboard Hot 100, becoming Rihanna's twenty-fourth top ten on the chart, thus surpassing Whitney Houston's tally. Furthermore, it has charted at number one on the US Pop Songs chart and 16 on the Hot Dance Club Songs chart. Worldwide the single has sold over 10 million copies making it one of the best selling singles of all time. The song's accompanying music video, directed by Sophie Muller, depicts Rihanna naked in a bathtub filled with cloudy water, while Ekko sings in a separate bathroom. Critics likened the vulnerability and raw emotion in the video to the song itself. Rihanna premiered \"Stay\" on Saturday Night Live in the United States, while she performed the song in the United Kingdom on the ninth series of The X Factor. Rihanna and Ekko also performed \"Stay\" at the 2013 Grammy Awards. The track was included on the set list of the majority of her 777 Tour promotional tour dates, in support of the album, while it is included on Rihanna's fifth headlining tour, the \"Diamonds World Tour\"."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"Team\" is a song by New Zealand singer Lorde, taken from her debut studio album, Pure Heroine (2013). The song was released on 13 September 2013 as the album's third single in Australia and New Zealand by Universal Music New Zealand, and the second in the United States and the United Kingdom by Lava and Republic Records. The track was written by Lorde and Joel Little and produced by Little, with additional production from Lorde herself. \"Team\" is a hybrid of alternative pop and electro-hop featuring synthesiser, bass and snare drum instrumentation over a handclap-based beat. Lyrically, the track is a \"tribute to her friends and country\". \"Team\" was generally well received by most contemporary critics, who praised its musical style, lyrical content and Lorde's vocal delivery on the track. The single garnered success on charts worldwide, peaking at number 6 on the US Billboard Hot 100 and at number 3 on the Canadian Hot 100 chart. It was also successful in Oceania, peaking at number 19 in Australia and debuting and peaking number 3 in New Zealand. \"Team\" was certified platinum by both the Australian Recording Industry Association and Recorded Music NZ. A music video for the song was directed by Young Replicant and was released on 4 December 2013. Filmed in an abandoned building named Red Hook Grain Terminal in Red Hook, Brooklyn, the video's content was inspired by Lorde's dream of an own world for teenagers. Upon its release, the clip crashed Vevo's channel due to a high number of views. To promote \"Team\" and Pure Heroine, Lorde performed the song on several occasions, including on Late Show with David Letterman and at the ARIA Music Awards of 2013. It was later featured on a Season 10 episode of Grey's Anatomy which aired in December 2013."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"The Miracle\" is the fifth and final single from Queen's 1989 studio album of the same name. It was composed by the entire band, though Freddie Mercury and John Deacon were the primary writers. It was released as a single in late November 1989, some six months after the album. It was the last of the singles from that album to be released, and the first 5th single released from any of Queen's albums from EMI. The sleeve artwork for the single uses the album's artwork inverted with a hologram-like fashion. The B-side of the single is a live version of the song \"Stone Cold Crazy\", which can be found along with \"My Melancholy Blues\" from the album News Of The World. The idea for the song came from Freddie Mercury and John Deacon, who wrote the basic chord structure for the song. All four contributed to the lyrics and musical ideas, and the song was still credited to the entire band because they had agreed to do so during the album recording, regardless of who had been the actual writer. While both Mercury and May regarded this as one of their favourites, Taylor said in the audio commentary of Greatest Video Hits II that although it was not a favourite of his, he respected it as \"an incredibly complex track\". The song describes several of \"God's creations, great and small\", such as great buildings like the Taj Mahal and the Tower of Babel, all described as \"miracles\" in the song, yet the one miracle \"we're all waiting for\" is \"peace on Earth and an end to war.\" The song also references such well-known figures as Captain Cook, Cain and Abel, and Jimi Hendrix."@en ;

In the video Dave tries unsuccessfully to get the attention of a classmate. When it aired on MTV, the chorus was slightly altered.

	dbo:abstract	"\"The War Song\" is a 1984 song by the British band Culture Club which features background vocals by Clare Torry. It was the lead single from the band's third album Waking Up with the House on Fire. The song became the group's seventh top-five hit on the UK Singles Chart, peaking at number two. In the U.S. the single peaked at #17 on the Billboard Hot 100 and hit the top ten in many countries including Canada (#7), Ireland (#1), Italy (#3) and Australia (#2). While very popular at the time, it was not appreciated by some music critics for some weakness in the lyrics and less original arrangements. The song was assisted by a popular music video, directed by Russell Mulcahy, which features hundreds of children dressed as skeletons. Lead singer Boy George is shown with his new flame-red hair, and also employs four wigs in black, white, yellow and blue. The video cost more than \u00A3100,000 to make.[citation needed] In many countries, the single was released with a B-Side consisting of a native-language version (Spanish, French, Japanese or German) of the song. It was available in two different extended versions, a first in Culture Club discography. Its 7\" picture disc was shelved, and the only remaining copies are very rare. It was Culture Club's last UK top 5 hit before 1998's \"I Just Wanna Be Loved\". At the time of its release, Boy George claimed that the song was \"the best thing we've ever done.\" However, since then he has joked about the song: \"It ruined my career\", mentioning often that he is not proud of this song.[citation needed] It has also been excluded from some music compilations of the band. Though not performed live by Culture Club since 1985, it was performed on New Years Eve 2011 when Culture Club reunited for a one-off gig. The band also played the song in 2014. It was parodied on the satirical British TV series Spitting Image as \"War Is Naughty\", a reference to the main phrase of the original song's chorus (\"War is stupid\")."@en ;

Williams himself calls the song \"something like a mini gangster opera\" and \"kind of cabaret act reggae\". The rolling rhythm of the song owes much to the early work of The Clash. During the chorus Williams reaches an extremely high disco-like head voice. Lyrically the song is a bit darker than previous songs. It tells the tale of gangsters and how they \"don't kill their own and they all love their mothers\", before an anguished chorus of \"I've taken as much as I'm willing to take\". The opening lyrics \"First they ignore you, then laugh at you and hate you. Then they fight you, then you win\" is a paraphrase from a quote commonly attributed to Mahatma Gandhi.

	dbo:abstract	"\"Tunnel of Love\" is a 1980 rock song by Dire Straits. It appears on the album Making Movies, and subsequently on the live albums Alchemy and Live at the BBC and the greatest hits albums Money for Nothing, Sultans of Swing: The Very Best of Dire Straits, and The Best of Dire Straits & Mark Knopfler: Private Investigations. It reached the position of only #54 in the UK Singles Chart upon its single release in October 1981, despite being one of the band's most famous and popular songs. Two music videos exist for the song, one depicting Mark Knopfler, John Illsley and Pick Withers performing on a blank set, intercut with imagery and actors relevant to the lyrics, the other featuring a larger band arrangement and telling the story of a couple escaping a group of soldiers who chase them from a funfair. The Spanish City in the song was a fairground located in Whitley Bay, part of the North Sea coast to the north-east of Newcastle upon Tyne, one train stop along from Cullercoats as mentioned in the song. The term \"Rockaway\" references Rockaway Beach in New York City, the location of the Rockaways' Playland amusement park. In 1980s concerts, Dire Straits played the central theme of The Animals' \"Don't Let Me Be Misunderstood\" during an extended instrumental introduction to the song, as Knopfler talked about that group's hometown of Newcastle. Knopfler's outro solo has received numerous plaudits over the years: \"Throughout \"Tunnel of Love,\" Mark Knopfler dramatizes this close encounter by using his guitar as a Greek chorus. [...] Later, as Knopfler walks alone through the \"carousel and the carnival arcades,\" waiting for another night and another girl, he wraps his voice like a ratty old raincoat around Bittan's gently tinkling piano and the long guitar solo that ends the track. Somehow, the evocative moan of the artist's guitar suggests a truth much deeper than the carnival-as-life metaphor has revealed.\" \"Tunnel of Love\" is one of only three Dire Straits songs not credited to Mark Knopfler alone (the other two are \"Money for Nothing\" and \"What's The Matter Baby?\"). The song itself is entirely by Knopfler, but the opening instrumental is an arrangement of the \"Carousel Waltz\" from the Rodgers and Hammerstein musical Carousel. Mark Knopfler also sometimes played melody from chorus of Stop! In the Name of Love by The Supremes as an additional intro prior to the \"Carousel Waltz\" while performing this song live. The song is referred to in the novel So Long, and Thanks for All the Fish by Douglas Adams: \"Mark Knopfler has an extraordinary ability to make a Schecter Custom Stratocaster hoot and sing like angels on a Saturday night, exhausted from being good all week and needing a stiff drink.\" It was used in the 1982 film An Officer and a Gentleman. The song is sampled in John Legend's \"I Love, You Love\" on his 2008 Evolver album. The English folk duo Show of Hands recorded a cover version of this song on their 2011 album Covers 2."@en ;

The song received generally favorable reviews from music critics and it earned D'Angelo a number of awards. \"Untitled (How Does It Feel)\" also earned notice for its controversial music video. Directed by Paul Hunter and Dominique Trenier, the video consists entirely of one shot featuring a muscular D'Angelo appearing nude and lip-synching to the track. While initial reaction from viewers was divided with praise for its sexuality and accusations of sexual objectification, the video received considerable airplay on music video networks such as MTV and BET, and it helped increase mainstream notice of D'Angelo and Voodoo. The music video for \"Untitled (How Does It Feel)\" had a considerable impact on D'Angelo's recording career, as it helped engender an image of him as a sex icon to a younger generation of fans. However, his discontent with this image led to his period of absence from the music scene following the conclusion of the supporting tour for Voodoo. The song won a Grammy Award for Best Male R&B Vocal Performance at the 43rd Grammy Awards in 2001. Rolling Stone magazine named \"Untitled (How Does It Feel)\" the fourth best single of 2000. The magazine later named it the fifty-first best song of the 2000s (decade)."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"5D (Fifth Dimension)\" is a song by the American rock band The Byrds, written by band member Jim McGuinn. It was released as a single on June 13, 1966 and reached #44 on the Billboard Hot 100 but failed to chart in the United Kingdom. The song was also included on the band's third album, Fifth Dimension, released on July 18, 1966. \"5D (Fifth Dimension)\" followed the release of the band's influential \"Eight Miles High\" single and arguably took The Byrds' psychedelic experimentation to even further extremes than their previous single had. According to McGuinn, the song's lyrics were an attempt to explain Einstein's theory of relativity and were directly inspired by the book 1-2-3-4, More, More, More, More by Don Landis. In a 1966 interview with Hit Parader magazine the guitarist stated \"It's sort of weird but...what I'm talking about is the whole universe, the fifth dimension, which is height, width, depth, time and something else. But there definitely are more dimensions than five. It's infinite. The fifth dimension is the threshold of scientific knowledge.\" Talking to Michael Ross of Creem magazine in 1970, McGuinn further explained the song's meaning: \"'5D' was an ethereal trip into metaphysics, into an almost Moslem submission to an Allah, an almighty spirit, free-floating, the fifth dimension being the 'mesh' which Einstein theorized about. He proved theoretically - but I choose to believe it.\" The song's abstract lyrics were largely interpreted by the band's audience as being about an LSD trip, much to McGuinn's dismay. The notion that the song was about drugs was given further credence when it was singled out, within a month of its release, by Variety magazine as one of a recent spate of pop songs containing references to illegal drug use. As a result of these allegations, the song was banned by some radio stations in the U.S. The master recording of \"5D (Fifth Dimension)\" was taped on May 24 and 25, 1966, during sessions for the Fifth Dimension album, with Allen Stanton serving as producer. The song features the Bach-influenced organ and electric piano playing of Los Angeles composer, arranger, producer, and session musician Van Dyke Parks. \"5D (Fifth Dimension)\" was a favorite of The Byrds' bass player, Chris Hillman, who described it as \"one of the greatest songs McGuinn has ever written.\" Following its release, the song was performed sporadically during The Byrds' 1966 live concerts but was abandoned for the rest of the group's lifespan. However, the song is frequently performed by McGuinn during his solo concerts and consequently appears on his 2007 live album, Live From Spain. In addition to its appearance on the Fifth Dimension album, \"5D (Fifth Dimension)\" also appears on several Byrds' compilations, including The Byrds' Greatest Hits, History of The Byrds, The Original Singles: 1965\u20131967, Volume 1, The Byrds, The Very Best of The Byrds, The Essential Byrds, and There Is a Season."@en ;

Originally, the 7\" single was scheduled to be a limited run of 1000 copies, but due to an error at the record label, all formats were limited to 1000 copies, seriously hindering the single's chart chances. B-side-wise, the single is a rich mix. The 7\" features a co-write between the band's Bob Stanley and Pete Wiggs and David Essex, who featured on the album. The first CD features a cover of the Womack & Womack track \"Missing Persons Bureau\" (credited to their pseudonym Dr Rue & The Gypsy Wave Banner).

dbr:Another_Day_in_Paradise	rdf:type	dbo:MusicalWork ;
	dbo:abstract	"\"Another Day in Paradise\" is a protest song recorded by English drummer and singer Phil Collins. Produced by Collins along with Hugh Padgham, it was released as the first single from his number-one album ...But Seriously (1989). As with his song for Genesis, \"Man on the Corner\", the track has as its subject the problem of homelessness; as such, the song was a substantial departure from the dance-pop music of his previous album, No Jacket Required (1985). Collins sings the song from a third-person perspective, observing as a man crosses the street to ignore a homeless woman, and he implores listeners not to turn a blind eye to homelessness because, by drawing a religious allusion, \"it's just another day for you and me in paradise\". Collins also appeals directly to God by singing: \"Oh Lord, is there nothing more anybody can do? Oh Lord, there must be something you can say?\" The song was Collins' seventh and final Billboard Hot 100 number-one single, and the first number-one single of the 1990s. It was also a worldwide success, eventually becoming one of the most successful songs of his solo career. It won Collins and Padgham the Grammy Award for Record of the Year at the 1991 awards ceremony, while it was also nominated for Song of the Year, Best Pop Vocal Performance, Male and Best Music Video, Short Form. \"Another Day in Paradise\" also won an award for Best British Single at the 1990 BRIT Awards. Despite the awards gained following its release, the song also generated controversy over its subject matter and has received a largely negative reaction from music critics. Collins and David Crosby's live performance of the song at the 1991 Grammy Awards was released on the 1994 album Grammy's Greatest Moments Volume I. In 2009, Collins's version was listed at 86th on Billboard's Greatest Songs of All Time. \"Another Day in Paradise\" has since been covered by several artists, including Brandy, and her brother Ray J, Jam Tronik, Axxis, Novecento, and Hank Marvin."@en ;

His replacement Brian Johnson recalled to Mojo magazine in 2009 that when the band asked him to write a lyric for this song, \"they said, 'it can't be morbid \u2013 it has to be for Bon and it has to be a celebration.'\" He added: \"I thought, 'Well no pressure there, then' (laughs). I just wrote what came into my head, which at the time seemed like mumbo, jumbo. 'Nine lives. Cats eyes. Abusing every one of them and running wild.' The boys got it though. They saw Bon's life in that lyric.\" It peaked in the U.S. at No. 37 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart in 1981 and was No. 51 on Billboard's Top Tracks chart, which debuted in March 1981. \"Back in Black\" received the RIAA's Master Ringtone Sales Award (Gold and Platinum) in 2006 and reached 2\u00D7 Platinum status in 2007. The song was ranked No. 4 by VH1 on their list of the 40 Greatest Metal Songs, and in 2009, it was named the second greatest hard rock song of all time by VH1. It was also ranked No. 187 on Rolling Stone's list of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time. The same magazine has also ranked \"Back in Black\" No. 29 on \"The 100 Greatest Guitar Songs of All Time\".

The song is included as a playable track in the music video games Rock Band 2, Rock Revolution, Rock Band Unplugged and Guitar Hero Live in addition to appearing in the Shavo Odadjian-directed TV spot and launch trailer for Mortal Kombat X.

The song received positive reviews from most music critics, who praised Jackson's sweet delivery and the song's instrumentation; it was also called a sexy and silky ballad. It became a commercial success on the charts, reaching the top three in Canada and the United States, while also reaching the top twenty in the United Kingdom. The music video for the song was directed by Dominic Sena and it was set in Paris. The romantic video features Jackson's former boyfriend Ren\u00E9 Elizondo, Jr..

It was released on September 12, 2006, through Hollywood Records as the lead single from Hudgens' debut studio album, V (2006). The song is built around a sample of \"Baby Come Back\" (1977) by American band Player. Due to the inclusion of the sample, the original song's writers, Peter Beckett and J.C. Crowley, obtained writing credits. Musically, \"Come Back to Me\" is a pop and R&B song with an urban beat, string instruments and hand claps. Critical reception of \"Come Back to Me\" was generally positive; some critics praised the inclusion of the Player sample and named the song one of the album's best tracks. However, it was criticized for holding a manufactured and overproduced sound. It performed moderately in the United States, where it peaked at number 55 on the Billboard Hot 100 and number 18 on the Pop Songs chart. It fared better internationally as it peaked in the top 20 in several countries, including France, Italy, New Zealand and Spain.

It featured a comparatively rare lead vocal performance from cockney-accented Squeeze lyricist Chris Difford, one of only two occasions he sang lead on a Squeeze single A-side (the other was 1989's \"Love Circles\"). The song, slightly edited from the album track, peaked at No. 2 on the UK Singles Chart, making it one of the band's biggest hits. The title phrase is a reference to the 1950s/60s UK TV series Cool for Cats, the first British series to regularly feature rock 'n' roll music acts. In 1992, thirteen years after its initial release, the track \"Cool for Cats\" was used in a British TV commercial for milk. The song was then re-issued in the UK, where it charted at No. 62. The song is also a playable track on Rock Band 2. There is a persistent rumour that one of the two women dancing and singing the distinctive \"Cool for Cats\" chorus in the video to the song is Michelle Collins, who later found fame as Cindy Beale in BBC TV's EastEnders. However, during a radio interview in 2009, Collins said this was untrue (contradicting a 2002 interview)."@en ;

The song was released as the fourth and final single from the album. \"Criminal\" was written and produced by Max Martin and Shellback, with additional writing by Tiffany Amber. After Spears first listened to the song, she felt it was different and unlike anything she had heard before. She posted a snippet of it online on March 2, 2011, prior to the album's release. \"Criminal\" was chosen as a single by a poll on her Facebook page, as Spears explained it was a way to give back to her fans. The artwork for the single was released on September 14, 2011. \"Criminal\" is a guitar and synth-driven mid-tempo pop ballad which incorporates a folk-style flute melody. It is considered the only ballad on Femme Fatale, and is less aggressive than the other songs of the album. \"Criminal\" is influenced by the works of ABBA and Madonna. In the song, Spears sings about being in love with a bad boy and outlaw, and pleads to her mother to not worry about their relationship. \"Criminal\" received mostly critical acclaim, with reviewers praising its organic and refreshing feel in comparison with the rest of the album. After the release of Femme Fatale, the song charted on the South Korean International chart. \"Criminal\" has also charted in major markets such as Canada, France, Sweden, Switzerland and the United States. The accompanying music video for the song was filmed at Dalston and Stoke Newington, London. It features Spears as a woman in upper society and follows her relationship with a criminal, played by her then real-life boyfriend Jason Trawick. Prior to its release, London officials criticized Spears for shooting scenes with a replica gun and glamorizing violence. The video received a positive response from critics, with some calling it the best music video from Femme Fatale. Reviewers also noted the parallels between the storyline and themes of the video with Spears's personal life."@en ;

An apparently lighthearted song (with references to the English children's game of using the seedheads of dandelions as clocks) albeit with an undertone of wistfulness, it reached #14 in the United States, and effectively became the A-side there (as the edgier \u201CWe Love You\u201D disappointed at #50 on US charts). This is reflected in \u201CDandelion\u201D appearing on both the US and United Kingdom versions of Through the Past, Darkly (Big Hits Vol. 2) in 1969, while \u201CWe Love You\u201D appeared only on the UK version. The first demo version of \u201CDandelion\u201D was recorded in November 1966; it was originally titled \u201CSometimes Happy, Sometimes Blue\u201D, had different lyrics, and was sung and played by Keith Richards.

	dbo:abstract	"\"Don't Let Go (Love)\" is a song by American R&B group En Vogue. It was written by Ivan Matias, Andrea Martin, Marqueze Etheridge and produced by Organized Noize and Ivan Matias for the Set It Off soundtrack (1996), also appearing on the group's third album, EV3 (1997). The song was the band's last single to feature former band member Dawn Robinson, on lead vocals, and became En Vogue's biggest international single, peaking in the top ten of many countries. It hit #5 in the UK in early 1997 and spent 13 weeks in the UK top 40, eight of those weeks in the top ten. \"Don't Let Go (Love)\" became the third En Vogue track to peak at #2 on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 where it was the group's fifth and final Top Ten hit. The song was a #1 R&B song for 1 week becoming En Vogue's sixth and final #1 R&B Hit to date. The single re-entered the UK chart at number 23 in 2011 after girl group Little Mix performed the song on the eighth series of British television talent contest The X Factor on November 19, 2011: the En Vogue track reached #23 on the UK chart and also returned to the Irish charts at #50. The single sold 1.3 million copies in the United States and was certified platinum by the RIAA. In October 2011, NME placed it at number 127 on its list \"150 Best Tracks of the Past 15 Years\". The song was notable in the 1996 movie Set It Off. This song compelled Elektra mogul Sylvia Rhone to place En Vogue back in the studio to record their EV3 for release in 1997. However, Dawn Robinson felt a solo career was not feasible while she was still a member of En Vogue, while the other group members plus the record producers and label executives were focused on the new En Vogue album. Forced to choose, Robinson decided to leave En Vogue for a solo career with Dr. Dre's Aftermath Records. The turn of events following the success of \"Don't Let Go (Love)\" was the beginning of a long and tumultuous era for En Vogue as member changes became quite frequent."@en ;

The song then expands into a \"freight train\" rhythm to underscore its theme. It was released as the second single from the album, eventually peaking at number 63 in the U.S. on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. The music video for \"End of the Line\" was filmed after Roy Orbison's death in December 1988. To honor the loss, a shot of a guitar sitting in a rocking chair next to a photo of Orbison was used when Orbison's vocals are heard."@en ;

It reached #36 on the Top 40 Mainstream, #38 on Modern Rock Tracks, and #8 on Adult Top 40. A live version of \"Everyday\" is featured on the Dave Matthews Band compilation album The Best of What's Around Vol. 1. The song evolved from an earlier DMB song entitled \"#36\" and references The Beatles' song All You Need Is Love. When the song is played live, the song \"#36\" is mixed in with the song \"Everyday.\" It is also a tradition for the crowd to sing, \"Hani, Hani, come and dance with me\" during the parts of the song that #36 mixes in with. This can be heard on such CDs as The Best of What's Around Vol. 1, Live Trax Vol. 6, The Gorge, Live at Folsom Field, Boulder, Colorado, and on Weekend on the Rocks. An acoustic version of the song was played live on February 28, 2001 by Dave Matthews and Trey Anastasio during the latter's solo performance at the Landmark Theatre in Richmond, Virginia. On September 21, 2001, Dave Matthews played an acoustic version of the song as part of the America: A Tribute to Heroes concert, performed in remembrance of the victims of the September 11 attacks. The song was not originally supposed to be the third single from the album. \"When the World Ends\" was originally supposed to be the single, but after 9/11 it was thought that the dark title would not be appropriate."@en ;

It was released as the third and final single from the album on February 27, 2009 by Hollywood Records. The song contains pop rock, dance-pop and synthpop elements. The song's lyrics have been interpreted in a number of ways, such as a description of an abusive boyfriend. In actuality, Cyrus says the song describes paparazzi and their extensive personal privacy invasions. The song received critical praise, with several critics claiming it defied teen pop expectations and was Breakout's best track. Despite only reaching number eighty-four on the United States chart Billboard Hot 100, \"Fly on the Wall\" performed better commercially in various European regions. \"Fly on the Wall\" reached its highest international peak on the UK Singles Chart, at number sixteen. The single's music video was directed by Philip Andelman and premiered on FNMTV. The \"Thriller\" inspired video takes place mainly in a parking garage in which Cyrus encounters and attempts to escape the paparazzi. Cyrus promoted the song through several venues, including a performance on her second headlining tour, the Wonder World Tour, that incorporated a short segment of the \"Thriller\" dance. Cyrus also performed the song in the Gypsy Heart Tour. The song, along with \"Start All Over\" and \"\"Who Owns My Heart\" are the only singles released by Cyrus that haven't been certified at least platinum in the United States."@en ;

The single was intended to promote the forthcoming double-live album The Thieving Magpie, which documents the band's history with singer Fish, who had left the band in October 1988; as such, this was Marillion's last ever single to feature Fish on vocals and cover art by Mark Wilkinson, who would go on to collaborate with Fish. The single peaked at no. 24 in the UK Singles Chart, becoming their eleventh consecutive UK Top 40 hit. The track \"Freaks\" (recorded at an open-air concert at the May Market fairground in Mannheim, Germany, in 1986) was only included on the CD and cassette versions of The Thieving Magpie, \"Kayleigh\" (recorded at London Hammersmith Odeon on 9 or 10 January 1986) was also available on the vinyl edition, which only featured the first half of the Misplaced Childhood album. The 12\" version contained an additional two tracks from the second half of Misplaced Childhood, which are also not found on the vinyl version of The Thieving Magpie.

Unlike most protest songs, the track is upbeat and celebratory, drawing on musical influences from South Africa. The song peaked at number nine on the UK Singles Chart and was immensely popular in Africa.

	dbo:abstract	"\"Frozen\" is a song by American singer Madonna from her seventh studio album Ray of Light (1998). It was released as the lead single from the album on February 23, 1998, by Maverick Records. The song was also included on the compilation albums GHV2 (2001) and Celebration (2009). \"Frozen\" was written by Madonna and Patrick Leonard, and it was produced in collaboration with William Orbit. Musically constructed as a mid-tempo electronic ballad, \"Frozen\" talks about a cold and emotionless human being. In 2005, a judge in Belgium ruled that \"Frozen\" was plagiarized from a song by Salvatore Acquaviva, and was ultimately banned from the region. However, this ruling was overturned in 2014, lifting the Belgium ban on the song. \"Frozen\" received acclaim from music critics, some of whom deemed it an album standout. It was described as being a masterpiece, and its melodic beat and sound were defined as \"cinematic\". The song was a worldwide chart success, peaking at number two on the US Billboard Hot 100, becoming Madonna's sixth number-two single and the artist with most number-two hits in the history of that chart, while it reached number one on the Hot Dance Club Play chart. It ultimately peaked at number one in the United Kingdom, Italy, Spain and Finland, and also within the top-five in other countries, such as Australia, Italy, Sweden and Switzerland. The accompanying music video for \"Frozen\" was directed by Chris Cunningham in a desert in California, portraying Madonna as an ethereal, witchy, melancholy persona, shapeshifting into a flock of birds and a black dog. The music video received a MTV Video Music Award for \"Best Special Effects\" in 1998. To promote Ray of Light, the singer performed the song in several occasions including on Wetten dass..?. Additionally, it was included in three of Madonna's concert tours. \"Frozen\" has been covered by a number of artists, such as Talisman and Thy Disease."@en ;

The song features Jack Lawless on drums and John Taylor and the Jonas Brothers on guitars.

Musically, the song is an upbeat rock song with a guitar-driven sound. The song was met with positive reviews from critics and performed average commercially, peaking at number forty-three on the Billboard Hot 100 and ninety-three on the Canadian Hot 100.

	dbo:abstract	"\"God Only Knows\" is a song written by Brian Wilson and Tony Asher for American rock band The Beach Boys, released in May 1966 as the eighth track on the group's album Pet Sounds. Two months later, it was released as the B-side of \"Wouldn't It Be Nice\" in the United States. In other countries, \"God Only Knows\" was the single's A-side. According to historian John Robert Greene, \"God Only Knows\" led to the reinvention of the popular love song. The song names God in its title and lyrics, unusual for a pop single of its time, as Asher recalled: \"Unless you were Kate Smith and you were singing 'God Bless America', no one [in 1966] thought you could say 'God' in a song.\" The sentiments expressed in its lyric were not specific to any God, and could be addressed to any higher force, being a song about moving forward after loss. Wilson later explained that his and Asher's intention was to create the feeling of \"being blind but in being blind, you can see more\". Sung by his younger brother Carl Wilson, the Beach Boys' recording was produced and arranged by Brian using an unorthodox selection of instruments, including French horn, accordions, sleigh bell, harpsichord, and a quartet of violas and cellos heard throughout the piece in counterpoint. The musical structure has been variously cited for its harmonic complexity, inspiring tension through its disuse of authentic cadences and a definite key signature. Its closing section features perpetual rounds, a device that was not normally heard in popular music of the era. \"God Only Knows\" was voted 25 in Rolling Stone magazine's 500 Greatest Songs of All Time, the second of seven Beach Boys songs to feature (the first being \"Good Vibrations\" at 6), and was ranked by Pitchfork Media as the greatest song of the 1960s. The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame included it as one of \"500 Songs That Shaped Rock and Roll\"."@en ;

It was written by Eric Goudy II, Nelly, Earl Hood and co-written and produced by Rico Love & Jim Jonsin as a continuum to the love story outlined in \"Dilemma\". \"Gone\" was initially known as \"Dilemma p.2\" but the title was changed and Nelly stopped referring to the song as \"Dilemma\"' sequel for fear that it would not match people's expectations and through his desire for \"Gone\" to be recognised as a separate recording. The predominantly R&B-ballad contains elements of pop music and was sent to U.S. Urban/Urban AC radio stations on January 4, 2011. It was sent to top 40/mainstream stations on January 19, 2011 and serves as the third single from 5.0.

	dbo:abstract	"\"Good Enough\" is a song by American rock band Evanescence. It was released in 2007 as the fourth and final single from their second studio album, The Open Door. The song was written by lead vocalist Amy Lee and produced by Dave Fortman. According to Lee it was written for her long-time friend and husband, Josh Hartzler. It was placed as the last track on the album to symbolize a new beginning for the band. According to Lee, \"Good Enough\" was written for the soundtrack of the movie The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, but was not included. The producers of Narnia rebutted her claim, stating that no Evanescence music had been planned for inclusion in the soundtrack. The song is a piano ballad set in a moderately slow tempo and features piano and strings.

Govinda was previously recorded by singers from Radha Krsna Temple in a 1970 album produced by George Harrison. A music video was made for the song, which was directed by Michael Geoghegan. In one of his interviews Crispian Mills mentioned that the song was born out of an improvisation, based on an Hindu prayer to Krishna.

UFO conspiracy theories, or possibly Hangar 18, the 1980 film based on those theories, inspired drummer Nick Menza to write the lyrics.[citation needed] Shortly thereafter, frontman Dave Mustaine composed the bulk of the music. The intro is a rapidly strummed version of the D-minor arpeggio that Mustaine wrote for the Metallica instrumental track \"The Call of Ktulu\", which was the final Metallica music he was credited for. Hangar 18 is located at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base near Dayton, Ohio, and it is speculated that an alien aircraft was brought there from Roswell in 1947. The song reached number #25 on the Irish Singles Chart, also reached number #26 on the UK Singles Chart. The song is also particular in that the bass uses a different tuning from the two lead guitars, the bass being in dropped D while the guitars are in standard tuning. A sequel to this song called \"Return to Hangar\" was included on Megadeth's ninth album The World Needs a Hero. It tells the fictional story of the life-forms said to be contained in Hangar 18 coming back to life and killing those inside the building before escaping.[citation needed] \"Hangar 18\" was nominated for Best Metal Performance at the 1992 Grammy Awards."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"I'll Be There for You/You're All I Need to Get By\" is a Grammy Award-winning duet performed by rapper Method Man and R&B singer Mary J. Blige. The song is a remix of Method Man's \"All I Need\" (which appears on his 1994 debut album Tical), with an interpolation of Marvin Gaye and Tammi Terrell's 1968 hit, \"You're All I Need to Get By\", with Mary J. Blige singing the choruses, and backing vocals. Another version of the song was released, entitled \"Puff Daddy Mix,\" which was produced by Sean Combs. The song contains a new instrumental which includes a repeated sample (\"Lie together, cry together/I swear to God I hope we fuckin' die together\") from The Notorious B.I.G.'s \"Me & My Bitch\". Another remix version, titled \"Razor Sharp Mix\" was produced by RZA. The song sold 800,000 copies and was certified platinum by the RIAA. The song peaked at #3 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart on June 3, 1995, and #1 on the R&B singles chart in the May 20, 1995 issue of Billboard Magazine - a position it held for three weeks. The song also ended up winning the duo the Grammy Award for Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group in 1996. \"I'll Be There for You/You're All I Need to Get By\" appears on Radio 1 Established 1967, a compilation album celebrating the 40th anniversary of BBC Radio 1. In 2008, it was ranked #44 on VH1's \"100 Greatest Songs of Hip Hop\" list. In 2009, Method Man and Mary J. Blige performed the song together at VH1's 6th Annual Hip Hop Honors ceremony. The song is often cited as the hybrid of what's now known as \"Thug-Loved\" duets. In 2012, Complex ranked the song #1 on its list of \"The 25 Best Hip-Hop Love Songs.\" In a July 2012 interview with Complex magazine, Jean Claude \"Poke\" Olivier- one-half of the production team the Trackmasters- claimed they were the actual producers behind the Sean \"Puffy\" Combs remix, but were never properly credited for it. Instead, they were only credited as session musicians for programming the drums while Combs was credited as the producer."@en ;

It was also used for the Australian Seven Network's promotion of the season premiere of Packed to the Rafters. \"I'm Yours\" was immensely successful in the U.S. on the Billboard charts. At 76 weeks on the Hot 100, it held the record for most weeks spent on the chart, breaking the previous record of 69 weeks set by LeAnn Rimes' song \"How Do I Live\" in 1998; this record has since been broken by Imagine Dragons' \"Radioactive\", which spent 87 weeks on the chart, and AWOLNATION's \"Sail\", which spent 79 weeks on the chart. As of January 2013, it is the tenth best-selling digital song of all time in the U.S., selling over 6 million downloads, and 12.2 million worldwide. It remains Mraz's biggest US hit single to date.

The song, like its parent album, also stands in contrast to the Pet Shop Boys' predominantly electronic catalogue of songs, primarily having a pop/soft rock feel, opening with a piano, and featuring rock-style guitar and drums (even if synthesised). There is only sparse actual synthesised sounds in the song. The video, which portrays young actors in a New York artist's studio and does not draw on the song's political subtext, was directed by Bruce Weber, who had worked with the band before, most notably for their video for the 1990 single \"Being Boring\".

dbr:If_U_Seek_Amy	rdf:type	dbo:MusicalWork ;
	dbo:abstract	"\"If U Seek Amy\" (edited for radio as \"If U See Amy\") is a song recorded by American singer Britney Spears for her sixth studio album, Circus (2008). It was released on March 10, 2009 by Jive Records as the third single of the album, and was chosen by a poll on Spears's official website. \"If U Seek Amy\" was written and produced by Swedish producer Max Martin, who also wrote previous hits for her first three albums and marked as Spears's comeback song to Martin since 2001. In the song, Spears is looking for a woman named Amy in a club, and although it appears to be about sex, it is actually about how society perceives her life. Musically, \"If U Seek Amy\" is a dance-pop song with electropop influences and the use of instruments such as synthesizers and timpani. \"If U Seek Amy\" was generally well received by contemporary critics, who praised Spears's confident vocals and frequently cited it as the highlight of the album. After its release, \"If U Seek Amy\" caused controversy in English-speaking countries for the euphemism and lyrical content, along with the fact that if pronounced in certain dialect, \"If U Seek Amy\" could be thought of as a double entendre that is interpreted as \"F-U-C-K Me\" which caused the Parents Television Council (PTC) threatening to file indecency complaints against any radio station that played the song during daytime. An edited version of the song titled \"If U See Amy\" was released in some regions, including in stations owned by Clear Channel Radio and Austereo Radio Network. \"If U Seek Amy\" was a moderate success, reaching the top twenty in Australia, the United States, Canada, Ireland, the United Kingdom and many other countries worldwide. It was also her third single from Circus to reach the top twenty in the United States. The music video for \"If U Seek Amy\" begins with a parody of an America's Newsroom report by Megyn Kelly and portrays Spears at a sex party that takes place at her house. Towards the end, she changes into conservative housewife clothes and opens the front door with her family while paparazzi take pictures of them. It references some of her previous music videos such as \"...Baby One More Time\" and \"Piece of Me\". Critics noted the similarities with her past work and also compared it to the film Eyes Wide Shut. \"If U Seek Amy\" was performed at The Circus Starring Britney Spears (2009) and the Femme Fatale Tour (2011). It is currently performed as part of the revamped set list of Spears' Las Vegas residency show, Britney: Piece of Me (2013\u201317)."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"It's a Beautiful Thing\" is a rock song by Ocean Colour Scene (OCS). The album and single versions are a duet, featuring P.P. Arnold on vocals (as did previous single Travellers Tune). The song was released in 1998 and reached number 12 in the UK Singles Chart. It is taken from their 1997 chart-topping album Marchin' Already and was the fourth and final single to be released from the album, following \"Hundred Mile High City\", \"Travellers Tune\" and \"Better Day\". By not reaching the Top 10, the song broke the chain formed by the previous six singles which had all reached the Top 10. The band have never reached the Top 10 since. The lyrics are understood to be about Simon Fowler's (aka Sonny's) personal difficulties in coming out as gay. The title is a reference to the 1993 play and 1996 film Beautiful Thing. Love is the \"beautiful thing\", but Fowler also laments that it can be a \"terrible thing\"."@en ;

The single became Gaye's most successful duet single to date, later outperformed by Gaye's duets with Tammi Terrell. Gaye and Weston's duet peaked at #14 on the Billboard Pop charts and #4 on Billboard's Soul Singles chart in January 1967. \"It Takes Two\" was also Gaye's first major hit in the UK, where it peaked at #16 on the British singles charts in the spring of that same year. Also in 1967, soul singers Otis Redding and Carla Thomas covered the song for their duet album, King & Queen. It was also recorded by Donny and Marie Osmond in 1974. It was from their gold album \"I'm Leaving It All Up to You\". The song also appeared on The Osmonds album \"Around the World Live\" in late 1975.

It was made officially available for radio airplay on February 12, 2007. Adam Jones uses a talk box effect during the guitar solo. The song is in 9/8 time, except for the guitar solo where the rhythm is temporarily changed to 6/4 before going back to 9/8. The title has been said to primarily refer to the iambic meter used in the lyrics of the song, as 'jambi' means 'iamb' in Finnish, but given the lack of more than an inevitable amount of iambs in the lyrics, this possible reference is doubtful. This title has also been said to refer to Jambi, a province of Indonesia. From when this statement is made \"Here from the king's mountain view\", as if to imply he is the king of Jambi. Drummer Danny Carey stated that when bassist Justin Chancellor played the bass track of the song, it instantly reminded him of the children's television program Pee-wee's Playhouse, then singer Maynard James Keenan thought of the genie \"Jambi\" and had the idea to make the song's theme about making wishes."@en ;

dbr:Layla	rdf:type	dbo:MusicalWork ;
	dbo:abstract	"\"Layla\" is a song written by Eric Clapton and Jim Gordon, originally released by their blues rock band Derek and the Dominos, as the thirteenth track from their album Layla and Other Assorted Love Songs (November 1970). Its famously contrasting movements were composed separately by Clapton and Gordon. The song was inspired by a love story that originated as a poem The Story of Layla and Majnun in 5th-Century Arabia, later was adopted by the Persian poet Nizami Ganjavi, a copy of which Ian Dallas had given to Clapton. The book moved Clapton profoundly, as it was the tale of a young man who fell hopelessly in love with a beautiful, unavailable woman and who went crazy because he could not marry her. In his autobiography, Clapton states, \"Ian Dallas told me the tale of Layla and Manjun [sic], a romantic Persian love story in which a young man, Manjun [sic], falls passionately in love with the beautiful Layla, but is forbidden by her father to marry her and goes crazy with desire.\" The song was further inspired by Clapton's then unrequited love for Pattie Boyd, the wife of his friend and fellow musician George Harrison of The Beatles. \"Layla\" was unsuccessful on its initial release. The song has since experienced great critical and popular acclaim, and is often hailed as being among the greatest rock songs of all time. Two versions have achieved chart success, the first in 1972 and the second (without the piano coda) 20 years later as an acoustic Unplugged performance by Clapton. In 2004, \"Layla\" was ranked number 27 on Rolling Stone's list of \"The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time\", and the acoustic version won the 1993 Grammy Award for Best Rock Song."@en ;

Initially, \"Let Me Go\" was about letting go of someone and having them let go of you.

Critics gave the song mixed reviews, with some calling it \"a monster duet\", and others criticizing Kroeger's vocals and his involvement in the track. A music video was released on 15 October 2013, and it shows Lavigne roaming the halls of an abandoned mansion, with Kroeger's appearance being channeled through an elderly yardman, only to be seen as his true self through mirrored and tablet-assisted images.

This song peaked at number 12 on Billboard's Bubbling Under Hot 100 chart. A country remix of the song was released to country radio and peaked at number 60 on Billboard's Hot Country Singles & Tracks chart."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"Loverboy\" is a song by American singer-songwriter Mariah Carey. It was released on July 16, 2001 by Virgin Records America as the lead single from Glitter (2001). Written and produced by Carey, Larry Blackmon, Thomas Jenkins and Clark Kent, \"Loverboy\" is built around a sample from \"Candy\" by Cameo, who are also featured on the track. Lyrically, the song finds Carey fantasizing about her loverboy, a man that will fulfill her physical and sexual desires. The recording was accompanied by an official remix, titled \"Loverboy (Remix)\", featuring guest artists Ludacris, Da Brat, Shawnna and Twenty II. The track was subject to controversy, following reports that Jennifer Lopez and Tommy Mottola (Carey's ex-husband) stole the idea of sampling the singer's original planned sample, Yellow Magic Orchestra's \"Firecracker\", over a month after Carey had signed for it. Since Carey's Glitter was to be released over a month after Lopez's album, she changed the song's melody to sample from \"Candy\" instead. Controversy ensued following its release; Carey was hospitalized for severe mental and physical exhaustion, following poorly received television appearances involving the song and album. After the song's release in the United States, \"Loverboy\" stalled on the Billboard Hot 100. The song reached a peak of number two on the Hot 100 but failed to top the chart due to weak radio airplay. Though finishing as the best-selling song of 2001 in the United States, \"Loverboy\" became Carey's first lead single to not reach number one. Internationally, the song failed to garner strong charting, reaching the top-ten in Australia and Canada, and the top-twenty in Italy and the United Kingdom. \"Loverboy\" received generally mixed reviews from music critics; many called the song unoriginal and dated while others felt that the featured artists (primarily on the remix version) overpowered Carey and made the song disorganized. A music video, directed by David LaChapelle, was shot for both versions of the song. The first version features Carey as a scantily-clad car girl, waving a flag as her loverboy finishes a race. The video for the remix version features similar footage, only including shots of the song's guests in race-cars during their verses."@en ;

Originally released in the United Kingdom on September 8, 1983 by Sire Records, it was the fourth single from the album. The song also appears on her greatest hits compilations The Immaculate Collection (1990) and Celebration (2009). \"Lucky Star\" was written by Madonna and produced by Reggie Lucas. However, during recording, Madonna was not impressed by Lucas' version. She called her then-boyfriend John \"Jellybean\" Benitez to remix the track according to her ideas. \"Lucky Star\" is a medium-paced dance track and combines the heavy beats of a drum with the sounds of a guitar played in a high riff. The lyrics juxtapose the male body with the heavenly stars in the sky. Both contemporary and modern critics praised the song, heralding it as the introduction to upbeat dance music. \"Lucky Star\" became Madonna's first top-five hit on the Billboard Hot 100, when it reached the peak position of number four, becoming the second single in her record-breaking string of 17 consecutive top-ten hits. It had already become Madonna's first number-one song on the Billboard dance charts, when it peaked the chart alongside the previously released single \"Holiday\". The music video portrayed Madonna dancing in front of a white background, accompanied by her dancers. After the video was released, Madonna's style and mannerisms became a fashion trend among the younger generation. Scholars noted that in the video, Madonna portrayed herself as narcissistic and an ambiguous character. She referred to herself as the lucky star, unlike the lyrical meaning of the song. Madonna has performed the song in a number of live appearances, most recently at the Rebel Heart Tour (2015\u201316). It has also been covered by a number of artists."@en ;

Although \"Lullaby\" failed to reach the Billboard Hot 100 chart, it became a top 30 dance club hit. The song peaked at no. 27 on the Billboard Hot Dance Club Play chart and spent seven weeks on the chart. The track, over time, has become a signature song in the band's catalogue. The band utilized an string section of 20 Juilliard students, conducted by Michelle DiBucci, to record strings for the track, as well as bagpipes, played by a kilt wearing Roger Parsons. For the 12\" single, the track was remixed into five different remixes by Justin Strauss. The band, along with recording engineer \"Doc\" Dougherty, also remixed the track; titled \"Lullaby (7\u201D Version)\", this remix was included on the 7-inch and cassette singles sold at retail outlets as well as the promotional CD single. The cover art of the 12\" vinyl and cassette are drawings done by lead vocalist Susan Ottaviano. The drawings are in a similar style to Amedeo Modigliani, the subject of one of their previous singles, titled \"Modigliani (Lost In Your Eyes)\"."@en ;

The song was written by Furtado, Tim \"Timbaland\" Mosley, Nate \"Danja\" Hills, and Jim Beanz, and released to mainstream radio in the United States in September 2006. The song's musical style and production were inspired by pop arrangements from the 1980s by bands such as Eurythmics and Hall & Oates. Furtado stated that Hall & Oates' song of the same name was an influence during the writing and recording of the song. The song received positive reviews from music critics, most of them comparing the song to Madonna and Depeche Mode songs from the 1980s. Commercially, \"Maneater\" became one of Furtado's most popular singles, topping the singles charts in the United Kingdom, reaching the top ten across much of Europe, and the top five in Australia. It became a club hit in North America but was less commercially successful than the lead single \"Promiscuous\".

Written and produced by The Miracles members Smokey Robinson and Ronald White, the song became the Temptations' first U.S. number-one single, and is today their signature song. Robinson's inspiration for writing this song was his wife, Miracles member Claudette Rogers Robinson. The song was featured on the Temptations album The Temptations Sing Smokey. Musically, the song is notable because the six ascending guitar notes in the opening riff over the C chord are a perfect example of a C major pentatonic scale, played exactly from octave to octave. Similarly, the analogous riff in the song that is played over the F chord is a perfect example of an F major pentatonic scale, also with notes ascending from octave to octave."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"Open Your Heart\" is a song by American singer Madonna from her third studio album True Blue (1986). It was released as the album's fourth single in November 12, 1986 by Sire Records. It has since appeared remixed on the compilation albums The Immaculate Collection (1990) and Celebration (2009). Originally a rock 'n roll song with the title \"Follow Your Heart\", it was written for singer Cyndi Lauper by songwriters Gardner Cole and Peter Rafelson, although it was never played to her. Since Madonna's management was looking for new songs for True Blue, she accepted it. Madonna altered some of the lyrics and changed the composition to suit the dance-pop genre, giving her a co-writer credit for the song. Lyrically \"Open Your Heart\" is a love song, talking about innocent feelings of boy-meets-girl romance and Madonna expressing her sexual desire. The song was well received by critics who commended it for being a simple love song. It was also successful commercially, reaching the top-ten of the charts in Belgium, Canada, Ireland, Italy, Netherlands, and the United Kingdom, also reaching the top of Billboard Hot 100 in the United States, thus making it Madonna's fifth US number-one single. The music video, however, portrayed a different concept of the song. Madonna played an exotic dancer in a peep-show club, who befriends a little boy and subsequently escapes. It was critically acclaimed for portraying a completely opposite perspective of \"voyeuristic male gaze and object\", and depicting innocence rather than sexual overtones, although the entry of a child in a strip club was negatively criticized. The video was an homage to actresses Liza Minnelli and Marlene Dietrich. \"Open Your Heart\" has been performed by Madonna in three of her world tours \u2013 1987's Who's That Girl World Tour, 1990's Blond Ambition World Tour, where Madonna wore her infamous conical bra during the song, and 2012's The MDNA Tour. The performances were included in the respective video release of the tours. \"Open Your Heart\" has been covered a number of times by different artists, and appeared in the Britney Spears film, Crossroads (2002)."@en ;

Martin Gore told The Sun newspaper that he thought \"Peace\" is one of his favourite songs that he has ever written. He explained that both \"Peace\" and \"Little Soul\", \"give the album a kind of thread. Both of those songs have a real spiritual feel, though we have to be really careful using that word.\" The song charted at #57 in the UK charts, equal to their first ever single, \"Dreaming of Me\" in 1981. This is the band's second lowest UK singles chart position after \"Little 15\", originally intended to be a France-only release which reached #60 upon limited UK release in 1988. In Germany, \"Peace\" reached #25. The single version of the song has a completely different introduction. The music video for \"Peace\" was filmed in Romania by French duo Jonas & Fran\u00E7ois, it features Romanian actress Maria Dinulescu and marks the first Depeche Mode video to not include any of the band members (because of Dave Gahan's illness), save for a promotional poster near the end. The single was not released in the USA, where instead \"Perfect\" was released for promotional purposes only (i.e. non-commercial). A Dash Berlin remix of \"Peace\" and a Talla 2XLC remix are also available but do not appear on any of the official releases below. It was the first single by Depeche Mode not to be issued on 12\" vinyl since \"Dreaming of Me\" in 1981. Fans had reacted angrily to this decision and an on-line petition had been launched to try to convince Mute Records to release it. The petition could be signed at This song was performed on the 1st leg of the band's Tour of the Universe between \"Come Back\" and \"In Your Room\", but after the 1st leg was dropped and did not return for the rest of the tour."@en ;

Springsteen, in fact, vetoed the first attempt by a female singer to release a version of \"Pink Cadillac\", that being Bette Midler in 1983.

	dbo:abstract	"\"Radar\" is a song recorded by American singer Britney Spears for her fifth studio album, Blackout (2007). It was written and produced by Bloodshy & Avant and The Clutch, with additional writing from Henrik Jonback, as a record that did not relate to any of her personal problems at the time. The recording sessions took place the day after Spears filed for divorce from Kevin Federline, and members of The Clutch claimed to be surprised by her work ethic. \"Radar\" was originally planned to be released as the third single from Blackout, but \"Break the Ice\" was chosen instead. The song was then planned as the fourth single, but the release was cancelled as Spears began recording her sixth studio album, Circus (2008). \"Radar\" was later included as a bonus track on Circus, and released as the fourth and final single from the album on June 22, 2009 by Jive Records. Musically, \"Radar\" is an electropop and synthpop song, that runs through a midtempo dance groove. Spears' vocals are auto tuned and accompanied by sonar pulses and a heavy usage of distorted synthesizers. The lyrics refer to an attraction between the protagonist and a man, while she wonders if he knows what she is feeling. \"Radar\" received mixed reviews from critics; some called it one of the highlights of Blackout, while others felt that it was over-produced and also criticized her vocals for being processed. In July 2008, \"Radar\" charted in the top forty of Ireland and New Zealand, and inside the top-ten in Sweden. After it was released as a single from Circus, the track performed poorly on the charts and did not manage to enter the top forty in most countries. However, it became her 21st hit on the US Billboard's Pop Songs chart, the most for any artist of the decade. The single's accompanying music video was directed by Dave Meyers, and pays tribute to the music video of Madonna's \"Take a Bow\" (1994). In the video, Spears is an aristocratic woman involved in a love triangle with two men who are polo players. The video received mixed reviews from critics, who complimented the fashion but called the idea unoriginal. \"Radar\" was performed by Spears at The Circus Starring Britney Spears (2009), with the accompanying dance routine featuring her pole dancing."@en ;

E1 Music released \"Say Yes\" as the album's third single on June 2, 2014. \"Say Yes\" marks the third time the trio collaborated as solo artists following the disbandment of their group in 2006. Musically, \"Say Yes\" is an uptempo gospel and pop song, which takes influence from dance music. It samples a popular Nigerian gospel tune originally titled \"When Jesus Says Yes\". Upon release, \"Say Yes\" received generally favorable reviews from contemporary music critics who called the song infectious and praised its catchiness. Commercially the song performed well on the gospel charts in the US, peaking at number one for seven non-consecutive weeks on the Billboard Hot Gospel Songs. It also appeared on charts in the UK, France and Belgium across Europe. Billboard ranked \"Say Yes\" seventh on the 2014 year-end Hot Gospel Songs chart. An accompanying music video for \"Say Yes\" was directed by Matthew A. Cherry. It was released on June 18, 2014 when Williams appeared on Good Morning America. The clip depicts the three singers at a street party, dancing and singing with a crowd; along with solo appearances of each singer in a forest, wearing white clothes during their respective verses. It received generally positive reviews from critics who accredited it as a reunion of Destiny's Child and praised its feel-good nature."@en ;

The song was banned by the BBC during the Gulf War due to its address of war, nationalism and religion, as well as a direct reference to weaponry in the line, \"There's a gun and ammunition just inside the doorway.\" The Protomen released a cover of the song as a mash-up with their own song, \"Breaking Out\" in 2012 as a B-Side to their single \"I Drove All Night\", with an extended cover of the song later appearing as the final song on their 2015 album, The Cover Up.

	dbo:abstract	"\"Simply Irresistible\" is the first single released by English rock singer Robert Palmer from the 1988 studio album Heavy Nova and is presented in one of the most distinctive and memorable music videos of the 1980s. In 1988, the song reached #2 on the Billboard Hot 100 singles chart (behind \"Sweet Child o' Mine\") and was #1 on the Billboard Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks chart for three weeks. It also earned Palmer his second Grammy Award the following year, and the song was nominated for the Brit Award for Best British Single. Along with \"Addicted to Love\" and \"I Didn't Mean to Turn You On\", \"Simply Irresistible\" is among Palmer's most recognized songs, in part because of the iconic music video by renowned British fashion photographer Terence Donovan, famously parodied in a Pepsi commercial in 1989, which in turn was parodied again in another Pepsi commercial during Super Bowl XXXVI featuring Britney Spears, and in 2014 it was parodied in Ingrid Michaelson's single \"Girls Chase Boys\". The videos show Palmer surrounded by enigmatic women, styled in the manner of the artist Patrick Nagel. The video featured the leading supermodels and leading dancers that he met while visiting the Kentucky Derby (Karen Aubrey McElfresh, Kim Jones and Cheryl Day); Donovan's lighting and direction set the style for that era of music videos. \"Simply Irresistible\" later appeared in the 1999 Tony Award-winning musical Contact. It later featured in the 2000 cult drama picture American Psycho. The song was recently used in the 2013 animated special Madly Madagascar and in the video game Saints Row IV, as well as the show Happy Endings."@en ;

Supported by a new wave-inspired beat, dance synthesizers and a bass line, it is an uptempo electronic and electropop song. The lyrics were interpreted by the media as an \"insult\" to Buena's Sugababes replacement Amelle Berrabah, although Buena herself has denied such allegations. The song's production was met with critical acclaim, and various critics named it the song of the summer, while The Guardian and Xtra! highlighted it as one of the best songs of 2007. The song peaked at number eight on the UK Singles Chart and reached number one on the UK Dance Chart. It reached the top forty in Australia, Finland, Ireland and the Netherlands.

The song has become Smith's most successful single to date, peaking at number one in the UK Singles Chart (becoming his third chart-topper there, second as a solo artist), topping the charts in Canada and New Zealand, and reaching number two on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100. It has also reached top 10 status in over twelve countries worldwide. At the 57th Annual Grammy Awards ceremony, Darkchild's remix version of \"Stay with Me\" won two Grammy Awards for Record of the Year and Song of the Year."@en ;

It was released on November 13, 2000, by JIVE Records as the third single of the album. After meeting with producers Max Martin and Rami in Sweden, the singer recorded several songs for the album, including \"Stronger\". The teen pop and dance-pop song has self-empowerment lyrics about a girl who is tired of her cheating boyfriend and decides to live without him. It received acclaim from music critics, who described the song as both musically and lyrically innovative and considered it the best dance track from the album. \"Stronger\" achieved commercial success worldwide, reaching the top five in Austria, Germany and Sweden, while reaching the top ten in Finland, Ireland, Switzerland and United Kingdom. \"Stronger\" peaked at number eleven in the United States' Billboard Hot 100, and was later certified Gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), for selling over 500,000 units of the single. An accompanying music video was directed by Joseph Kahn, who considered it as a thematic departure from Spears' previous music videos. The music video received a nomination on the 2001 MTV Video Music Awards for Best Pop Video. Spears has performed \"Stronger\" in a number of live appearances, including at the Radio Music Awards of 2000, American Music Awards of 2001, a Fox special titled \"Britney in Hawaii\", and in two of her concert tours. It was first performed on the Oops!... I Did It Again World Tour (2000\u201301), as the first song from the show and at the Dream Within a Dream Tour (2001\u201302). Also, in 2013 Spears performed the song for the first time in eleven years on her Las Vegas residency concert Britney: Piece of Me. In 2010, \"Stronger\" was covered by actor Kevin McHale for an episode of TV series Glee titled \"Britney/Brittany\". The cover received positive reviews from contemporary music critics."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"Stronger\" is a song by American hip hop recording artist Kanye West, released as the second single from his third studio album, Graduation (2007). The production was handled by West, with an extended outro co-produced with Mike Dean. The composition is electronic in nature, employing synthesizers as its prominent instrument. For the track, West utilizes a vocoder-affected vocal sample of \"Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger\" by French house duo Daft Punk. On \"Stronger,\" West speaks about the resolve that comes when one is faced with adversity, with lyrics at the song's refrain that paraphrase Friedrich Nietzsche's famous dictum, \"What does not kill him, makes him stronger.\" West also describes \"Stronger\" as an \"emancipation\", using the track to vent his frustration over mistakes he made in the past year. The song's production process was arduous, with West and his team mixing the track reportedly over 75 times, including after its release as a single. Although he worked with eight different audio engineers and eleven different mix engineers around the world for the track, West still felt dissatisfied with the results and decided to enlist the aid of record producer Timbaland in redoing its drum programming prior to the release of Graduation. West felt \"Stronger\" paled in comparison to the sampled original, but Daft Punk were delighted by the song, leading to future collaborations. The single's music video was directed by Hype Williams, features sci-fi imagery based on the 1988 anime film Akira, and was shot largely in Tokyo, Japan. Kanye West's use of shutter shades in the music video became a signature of his in the late 2000s. Released as a single on July 31, 2007, \"Stronger\" would top the Billboard Hot 100 several weeks later, becoming West's third number-one single. It was a top ten single in ten countries, topping the charts in four of them, including the United Kingdom. The song won a Grammy Award for Best Rap Solo Performance at the 50th Grammy Awards, and was named as one of the best songs of the year by Rolling Stone and Spin. Its popularity has been accredited to not only encouraging other hip-hop artists to incorporate house and electronica elements into their music, but also for playing a part in the revival of disco and electro-infused music in the ensuing years. \"Stronger\" has since sold five million copies in the United States."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"Stronger (What Doesn't Kill You)\" is a song by American recording artist Kelly Clarkson and the titular song from her fifth studio album, Stronger (2011). Originally titled as \"What Doesn't Kill You (Stronger)\", the song served as the album's second single on January 17, 2012 through RCA Records. Written by J\u00F6rgen Elofsson, Ali Tamposi, and David Gamson, with additional writing and production by Greg Kurstin, \"Stronger\" is an uptempo song which draws from the genres of pop rock, dance-pop and electropop. Its lyrical content mainly explores themes of empowerment and recovery following a heartbreak, with the chorus inspired by a Friedrich Nietzsche quotation: \"That which does not kill us makes us stronger.\" In the United States, \"Stronger\" became her third song to top the Billboard Hot 100 chart for three non-consecutive weeks, surpassing \"A Moment Like This\" (2002) and \"My Life Would Suck Without You\" (2009) as her longest-running number one single on the chart. It also topped fifteen other Billboard charts, including Adult Pop Songs, Adult Contemporary, Hot Dance Club Songs, and Pop Songs charts, more than any other song Clarkson has ever released. Internationally, \"Stronger\" topped the national charts of Poland and Slovakia and attained a top-ten position in over fifteen countries around the world, eventually selling over five million copies worldwide, becoming one of the best-selling singles of all time. Its success helped its parent album to sustain commercial longevity for over a year. \"Stronger\" merited consideration for several industry awards\u2014including three Grammy Award nominations, and a World Music Award nomination. The song's accompanying music video was filmed by Shane Drake, which incorporates the theme of a global flash mob dance, featuring submitted videos of people dancing to the song. The music video garnered positive reception from critics who felt that its overall impact was exuberant. It earned Clarkson a nomination for a MuchMusic Video Award. With its continued success, she performed \"Stronger\" on several live award shows and television appearances around the world, debuting it during the first season of the The X Factor (U.S.) and performing it on the 37th season of Saturday Night Live, the 2012 MuchMusic Video Awards, and the 2012 American Music Awards.

	dbo:abstract	"\"Surf's Up\" is a song written by Brian Wilson and Van Dyke Parks for American rock band the Beach Boys. Its title is an ironic nod to the group's earlier associations with surf music; nothing in the song is about surfing. Through its stream of consciousness lyric, the song details a man who experiences a spiritual awakening, resigns himself to God and the joy of enlightenment, and prophesies an optimistic hope for those who can capture the innocence of youth. From 1966 to 1967, \"Surf's Up\" was partially recorded for the group's unfinished studio album Smile before being shelved indefinitely. After Wilson was filmed performing the song for a 1967 television documentary covering the 1960s rock revolution, the composition acquired relative mystique. In 1971, the original studio recording was completed and served as the title track for the group's twenty-second official album. It was also released as a single, serving as the A-side to \"Don't Go Near the Water\", which did not chart. In 1967 it was acknowledged by classically-trained clarinetist David Oppenheim who called it \"too complex to get the first time around...'Surf's Up' is one aspect of new things happening in pop music today. As such, it is a symbol of the change many of these young musicians see in our future.\" Musicologist Philip Lambert named the song \"the soul of Smile\" for being the \"sum total of its creators' most profound artistic visions\" with its \"perfect marriage of an eloquent lyric with music of commensurate power and depth.\" In 2011, MOJO staff members voted it the greatest Beach Boys song."@en ;

It was composed by John, with lyrics provided by Bernie Taupin. \"The Last Song\" marked the first of John's American singles to benefit his AIDS foundation. Taupin faxed the lyrics to him in Paris, shortly after Queen lead singer Freddie Mercury died the previous year. \"I was crying all the time as I wrote the music\", John told The Advocate, \"and it was very hard for me to sing it\". The song tells of an estranged father coming to terms with the sexuality of his gay son, who is dying of an AIDS-related illness. Originally titled \"Song for 1992\", it was renamed to avoid dating it. The song was used during a closing montage featuring people who died of AIDS at the end of the 1993 film And the Band Played On. Gus Van Sant was not the first choice to direct the video. David Hockney and Madonna declined the offer. The song has been mentioned numerous times on the Howard Stern Show. Show producer Gary Dell'Abate, said that the song and music video reminds him of his brother, who died of AIDS around the time The One was released. When they first played the song on the air, Dell'Abate broke out in tears during the first verse."@en ;

The main B side was another album track from the UK version of the album, \"Why Look For The Key\", although with a slightly longer fade that made it about twenty seconds longer than the version on the UK version of Dream Into Action. \"You Jazzy Nork!\" is a reworked instrumental version of \"Why Look For The Key\" performed by the Alphonse Conway Orchestra.

	dbo:abstract	"\"Thinking of You\" is a song by American singer-songwriter Katy Perry, taken from her second studio album, One of the Boys (2008). The song was released on January 12, 2009 as the album's third single. The song was written by Perry and produced by Butch Walker, and is a pop rock and soft rock power ballad. Lyrically, the song deals with a break-up in which Perry does not want to move on but has no choice, and feels nostalgic of a previous lover while in a relationship with another man. It is one of the three songs on the album that Perry wrote solely herself along \"Fingerprints\" and \"Mannequin\". The song received generally positive reviews from music critics; however, it is Perry's lowest charting single from One of the Boys. The song peaked at number 29 on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart, becoming the album's only single to fail to reach the Top 20 in the United States, and peaked at number 27 in the United Kingdom. There are two music videos released for the song. The first was released in 2007 and featured Perry in two different rooms, black and white, and was directed by a friend of hers. The second was the commercial release in 2008 which was set in the 1940s and featured Perry playing a woman who lost her lover, a soldier (played by Matt Dallas), in battle during World War II. Perry began playing the song during gigs as early as 2006, and performed the song on all of her concert tours: the Hello Katy Tour, the California Dreams Tour and The Prismatic World Tour."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"This Is Love\" is a song by George Harrison, the former lead guitarist for the Beatles. Harrison co-wrote the song with Jeff Lynne. It is the fifth track on Harrison's eleventh studio solo album, Cloud Nine, which was released in 1987. In June 1988, the song was also released as the third single from that album, peaking at number 55 on the UK Singles Chart. The original B-side for this single was going to be \"Handle with Care\", a collaboration between Harrison, Lynne, Roy Orbison and Tom Petty recorded at Bob Dylan's studio in Santa Monica, California. When executives at Harrison's distributor Warner Bros. Records heard the track, they decided it was too good to be released as single \"filler\", a decision that resulted in the formation of the Traveling Wilburys, and the album Traveling Wilburys Vol. 1, with \"Handle with Care\" as the lead track and single. Steve Wood and Daniel May composed music to the 1998 documentary film Everest, incorporating melodies from some of Harrison's songs, one of which was \"This Is Love\"."@en ;
