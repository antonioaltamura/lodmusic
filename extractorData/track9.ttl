The single, led by Horton, is about a man who fools around with a lot of women and the woman who narrates the story warns him to stay away from her due to the stories she heard of him \"running around with every woman in town\". Horton is helped out in the song by her Marvelettes cohorts Wanda Young, Georgeanna Tillman, Katherine Anderson & Juanita Cowart. This was released as the third single by the Marvelettes and was their second top ten pop hit reaching number seven on the charts while reaching number four on the R&B chart."@en .

The title track had previously been recorded for the BBC and included on the 1987 compilation Louder Than Bombs and the 12\" of \"Sheila Take a Bow\"; \"I Keep Mine Hidden\", \"Work Is a Four-Letter Word\" and \"What's the World?\" were previously hard-to-find B-sides to earlier singles \"Girlfriend in a Coma\" and \"I Started Something I Couldn't Finish\" (both 1987).

In South Korea, the song peaked at number 41, while in the United Kingdom it peaked at number 142 on the UK Singles Chart and number 31 on the UK R&B Chart. In the United States, it peaked at number 11 on the Bubbling Under Hot 100 Singles, making this Rihanna's third single that failed to reach the US Billboard Hot 100 chart (\"We Ride\", \"Wait Your Turn\"). Following the song's release to US urban radio, \"Raining Men\" peaked at number 48 on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart. No music video was shot for the song, and it received no televised performances as part of promotion. The song was included on the set list of the Loud Tour (2011). The performance featured Rihanna in a camouflage inspired outfit, accompanied by dancers in the same attire who held pink rifles."@en ;

The song also features additional vocals from R&B artist Chris Brown. \"Right by My Side\" was written by Ester Dean, Minaj, and Safaree Samuels, while production was handled by Andrew \"Pop\" Wansel and Oak. On March 27, 2012, \"Right by My Side\" was released as the third official single from the album to Rhythmic and Urban radio in the U.S. Musically, \"Right by My Side\" is an upbeat ballad infused with elements of pop. It was compared to several other songs, including Jordin Sparks \"No Air\", in which Brown was featured on, Rihanna's \"You da One\", and even Minaj's own track \"Right Thru Me\". Critics noted the songs \"bubbly\" persona, as well as its high quality production. \"Right by My Side\" was received positively by music critics, though Brown's inclusion on the song caused mild controversy. Minaj performed the song live for the first time on 106 & Park on April 3, 2012. Minaj also performed the single during her surprise appearance at the Nokia Lumia 900 launch in Times Square."@en .

	dbo:abstract	"\"A Dozen Roses (You Remind Me)\" is a song by American recording artist Monica, taken from her fifth studio album The Makings of Me (2006). It was written by rapper-producer Missy Elliott and Corte Ellis, with production helmed by the former along with David \"Davey Boy\" Lindsey and Cliff Jones. Similar to songs that Monica used to record with Elliott for her previous album, After the Storm (2003), the mid-tempo love song draws from the genres from R&B, hip hop, neo soul, as well as quiet storm and contains limited elements of 1960s Motown soul music. Built around a sample of the 1972 recording \"The Makings of You\", written and performed by Curtis Mayfield, its lyrics detail a woman's admiration for a man. The song was released as the album's second single in the United States on September 28, 2006. It garnered generally positive reviews by music critics who compared it to R. Kelly's \"You Remind Me of Something\" (1995) and praised Elliott's nostalgic, cozy and unpretentious production. \"A Dozen Roses (You Remind Me)\" peaked at number 48 on Billboard's Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart, on which it became the singer's lowest-charting singles since 1999's \"Street Symphony\". The music video for \"A Dozen Roses (You Remind Me)\", directed Chris Robinson, was filmed in Los Angeles in October 2006 and depicts a meet cute between two lovers."@en ;

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ain\u0027t_Misbehavin\u0027_(song)>	rdf:type	dbo:MusicalWork ;
	dbo:abstract	"Ain't Misbehavin' is a 1929 stride jazz/early swing composition with 32 bars in AABA measure with a slow-to-moderate pace. With lyrics by Andy Razaf and score by Thomas \"Fats\" Waller and Harry Brooks, the number was created specifically as a theme song for the Razaf/Waller/Brooks off-Broadway musical comedy Connie's Hot Chocolates. In a 1941 interview with Eddie \"Rochester\" Anderson, Fats claimed the song was written while \"lodging\" in alimony prison, and that is why he was not \"misbehaving\". The song was first performed at the premiere of Connie's Hot Chocolates at Connie's Inn in Harlem as an opening number by Margaret Simms and Paul Bass, and repeated later in the musical by Russell Wooding's Hallelujah Singers. Connie's Hot Chocolates transferred to the Hudson Theatre on Broadway in June 1929, where it was renamed to Hot Chocolates and where Louis Armstrong took over as orchestra director. The script also required Armstrong to play Ain't Misbehavin' in a trumpet solo, and although this was initially slated to only be a reprise of the opening song, Armstrong's performance was so well received that the trumpeter was asked to climb out of the orchestra pit and play the piece on stage. In the first half of the 20th century, when a tune was successful in terms of sheet music sold, it was typically recorded by several different artists. All six Ain't Misbehavin' recordings of 1929 were hits in the ASCAP rankings for that year: Waller re-recorded the song with vocals for the 1943 film Stormy Weather. Waller's recording received the Grammy Hall of Fame Award in 1984, and it was one of fifty recordings selected for inclusion in the National Recording Registry by the Library of Congress in 2004. In 2001, it was one of 365 Songs of the Century selected by the RIAA. Ain't Misbehavin' has been recorded by many other performers over the years, including Anita O'Day, Sarah Vaughan (for \"Sarah Vaughan in Hi-Fi\"; 1950), Billie Holiday, Eartha Kitt, Ella Fitzgerald, Django Reinhardt, Harry James, Miles Davis, Kay Starr, Frankie Laine, Art Tatum, Floyd Pepper, Sonny Stitt, Sam Cooke, Johnnie Ray, Sidney Bechet, Ray Charles, Nat King Cole, Elkie Brooks, Eyran Katsenelenbogen, Willie Nelson, Kermit Ruffins, Leon Redbone, Freddie White, Dave Brubeck, and Bill Haley & His Comets (who recorded a rock and roll version in 1957). Johnnie Ray's version reached number 17 in the UK Singles Chart in May 1956. In 1960, Tommy Bruce and the Bruisers had a number 3 hit in the UK Singles Chart with their cover version of the song. Leon Redbone performed the song on Saturday Night Live in 1976. It served as the title song of the successful 1978 musical Ain't Misbehavin'."@en ;

On Billboard's Rhythmic Airplay Chart, the single reached number one, giving Bieber his first number one single on an American airplay music chart. Despite its peak at no. 6, it is currently his biggest hit on the Billboard Hot 100 due to its longevity in the top 20 from strong radio airplay.

	dbo:abstract	"\"Best Thing I Never Had\" is a song recorded by the American singer Beyonc\u00E9 for her fourth studio album, 4 (2011). It was released by Columbia Records on June 1, 2011, as the second single from the album. \"Best Thing I Never Had\" was composed by Patrick \"J. Que\" Smith, Kenneth \"Babyface\" Edmonds, Symbolyc One, Caleb McCambpell, Antonio Dixon, Beyonc\u00E9, and Shea Taylor. The song was originally not written as a ballad, but was inspired by the drumming on Doug E. Fresh's 1985 single \"The Show\". Beyonc\u00E9 said that anyone, regardless of gender, should be able to relate to the song. A pop and R&B ballad, the subjects of \"Best Thing I Never Had\" are revenge and karma. Not wanting to feel broken-hearted, the female protagonist sings that she feels happy to have left her lover, who did not recognize the potential for a happy life with her. The song was generally well received by contemporary music critics, who viewed it as a sequel to Beyonc\u00E9's 2006 single \"Irreplaceable\"\u2014the two songs are thematically similar. They praised Beyonc\u00E9's vocal delivery as well as the openness of the song's message; \"Best Thing I Never Had\" was deemed to have strong radio appeal. However, some lyrics, including \"showed your ass\" and \"sucks to be you right now\", were criticized. The ballad was also likened to Vanessa Carlton's 2002 single \"A Thousand Miles\" (2002). \"Best Thing I Never Had\" peaked at number 16 on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart and at number four on the US Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart. It rose to number three on the UK Singles Chart and number two on the Irish Singles Chart among others. The song reached number one on the South Korea Gaon International Chart, the UK R&B Chart, and the US Hot Dance Club Play chart, and the top 30 in mainland Europe, Oceania, and Canada. It was certified platinum by the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) and the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), and gold by the Recording Industry Association of New Zealand (RIANZ). The accompanying music video for \"Best Thing I Never Had\" was directed by Diane Martel. It shows Beyonc\u00E9 getting ready for her wedding while she recalls her ex-lover, who never gave her the attention she deserved. Critics generally wrote that Beyonc\u00E9 looked stunning in the bridal suite, and commended her ability to sing directly to the camera when telling the subject of the song that she was the best lover he ever had. \"Best Thing I Never Had\" was promoted with several live performances by Beyonc\u00E9, notably at the 2011 Glastonbury Festival and on the televised ABC show The View. The song was also included on the set list for her concert 4 Intimate Nights with Beyonc\u00E9 and other shows."@en ;

Released on June 13, 2008, the single marked the return of long-time vocalist Matt Barlow, who originally left the band in 2003, but later returned in 2007. I Walk Among You features four songs. A new song titled \"I Walk Alone\" (which was later included on the band's next full-length album The Crucible of Man) as well as three previously released songs re-sung by Barlow, all of which have also been remixed and re-mastered. One of the previously released songs, \"A Charge to Keep\", was initially released exclusively through the iTunes version of the single, although it later appeared on the Box Of The Wicked compilation some time later. A music video was also planned for the track \"I Walk Alone\", but due to some unknown issues with record company SPV, the plan never materialized. According to rhythm guitarist Jon Schaffer, the video was going to feature Set Abominae (the central figure of Schaffer's Something Wicked Saga, of which \"I Walk Alone\" is a part of) in an inter-dimensional world."@en ;

Released as an edited single in May 1967, it spent three weeks at number one on the Billboard Hot 100 chart in late July, and one week on the Cash Box Top 100, nearly a year after its recording. A year later, it re-entered the Billboard Hot 100 in 1968 following the success of Jose Feliciano's version of the song (which peaked at number 3 on the Billboard chart), peaking at number 87. The song was largely written by the band's guitarist Robby Krieger, and credited to the entire band. The single was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America in September 1967 for one million units shipped. As of December 1971 it was the band's best-selling single, with over 927,000 copies sold. A live version was released in 1983 on their album Alive, She Cried, the first of several live albums released in subsequent decades to include the song. \"Light My Fire\" achieved modest success in Australia, where it peaked at number 22 on the ARIA chart. The single originally reached number 49 in the UK in 1967, but experienced belated success in that country in 1991, when a reissue peaked at number 7. The reissue occurred on the back of revived interest in the band following Oliver Stone's film biopic The Doors. The song is number 35 on Rolling Stone's list of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time. It was included in the Songs of the Century list.

	dbo:abstract	"\"Make It Happen\" is a song by American singer-songwriter Mariah Carey. Written and produced by Carey and C+C Music Factory's David Cole and Robert Clivill\u00E9s, it was released on April 4, 1992, by Columbia Records as the third single from her second studio album, Emotions (1991). The pop-, R&B-, and dance-influenced track incorporates traces of gospel in its bridge and crescendo. Described by author Chris Nickson as Carey's most personal and inspirational song (up until \"Hero\"), it tells of her personal struggles prior to her rise to fame, and how her faith in God helped sustain her. The song was praised by music critics, many of whom applauded Carey's incorporation of several musical genres, as well as the song's personalized lyrical content. Aside from its critical acceptance, \"Make It Happen\" was successful in the United States, but charted weakly internationally compared to her previous singles. It peaked at number 5 on the Billboard Hot 100 and finished at number 42 on Billboard's Year-End Chart. The song reached number 7 in Canada and the top 40 in the United Kingdom and Australia, but did not reach the top 50 in the Netherlands and Germany. The song's music video was filmed in a cathedral-like church. A benefit event inside, titled \"Save Our Church\", features Carey as the main performer, leading a choir in song as she sings to the constant cheering and applause of the crowd. Aside from the video's message of prayer and religion, the video features men and women of different backgrounds. Carey included the song on the set lists of all of her concert tours throughout her career, and the track was included on her compilation albums Greatest Hits (2001), Playlist: The Very Best of Mariah Carey (2010), and The Essential Mariah Carey (2012)."@en ;

It serves as the lead-off single and title track to their second studio album, Need You Now (2010), and was first released in the US on August 11, 2009. The song also served as their debut single in the UK and Europe, where it was released April 23, 2010. It won four Grammy Awards in 2011, including for Song of the Year and Record of the Year, the first country song to win both honors since \"Not Ready to Make Nice\" by the Dixie Chicks won both in 2006, and only the second ever. The song spent five weeks at No. 1 on the Billboard Hot Country Songs chart in late 2009. Thereafter, \"Need You Now\" crossed over onto various pop and adult contemporary music charts, becoming a top five hit in Canada, Ireland, and New Zealand, as well as a top ten hit in the Netherlands and Norway. The song won Single of the Year and Song of the Year at the 2010 Academy of Country Music Awards, as well as Group Video of the Year at the 2010 CMT Music Awards. For the chart week of March 30, 2010, the song became the group's highest charting single on the Billboard Hot 100, reaching No. 2, the best position for a country song on that chart since Taylor Swift's \"Today Was a Fairytale\" reached the same position the previous month. The single has been certified sextuple platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). A music video was shot for the song, directed by Dave McClister. In the video the song has an extended piano intro, and features all members of the group acting out scenes related to the storyline. The song was initially released only to the country radio format in the United States and Canada on August 24, 2009, but was remixed and re-released to all other formats domestically and internationally at the beginning of 2010. The song gained prominence internationally, in Europe and South America. The trio re-recorded the song again in Simlish to accompany the release of the Sims 3 expansion pack Ambitions. By April 17, 2011, the song became the 9th most downloaded song in history, moving 5,000,000 copies, and surpassed Taylor Swift's \"Love Story\" as the most downloaded country song in history. It has since sold over 6 million copies in the US. The song was used in television series such as Hellcats and The Glades. \"Need You Now\" has also been covered by several artists, including Adele with Darius Rucker, Boyce Avenue and Glee Cast. \"Weird Al\" Yankovic included the chorus in \"Polka Face\", the polka medley from his 2011 album Alpocalypse."@en ;

The single was his third consecutive million-selling solo hit after \"I Heard It Through the Grapevine\" and \"Too Busy Thinking About My Baby\" written by Whitfield and Barrett Strong. Whitfield took the up-tempo Isley Brothers record, and turned it into a slowed-down psychedelic soul opus. Like \"Grapevine\", the song is sung by an emotionally wrought Gaye, singing the song in a preacher-like tone, who tells a woman to \"forget\" her lover now that that lover has gone off to someone else. The song peaked at #7 on the Billboard pop singles chart and held the #2 spot for five weeks on the soul singles chart in October 1969, eventually selling a million copies. The Temptations also covered the song as a B-side of \"Psychedelic Shack\" and released on their 1969 album Puzzle People. The song was covered for the 1991 Alan Parker film The Commitments."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"That Lady\" is a 1973 R&B and soul hit song for The Isley Brothers, released on their T-Neck imprint. The song, one of the group's most well known, was originally performed by the group nearly a decade before in 1964 (released as \"Who's That Lady?\") inspired by The Impressions. After signing with Epic Records in 1973, the eldest members of the group (O'Kelly Isley, Jr., Rudolph Isley and Ronald Isley) had included younger members, guitarist Ernie Isley, bassist Marvin Isley and keyboardist/pianist Chris Jasper, as official members. In a response to this transformation, the group gave themselves the moniker of 3 + 3, describing the three original vocalists in the group and three recruited instrumentalists, inspiring the aptly titled album that came out that year. They performed the song on Soul Train on December 14, 1974. The group entered the studio to remake \"Who's That Lady?\" after being inspired by rock acts such as Carlos Santana (who himself covered it on his 1990 album Spirits Dancing in the Flesh) bringing in a Latin percussive rock feel to it including congas and an organ solo by assorted other musicians while the other Isleys played various instrumentation. The two youngest Isley brothers and in-law Jasper re-wrote the instrumental while the older brothers revamped their harmonies, with Ronald showcasing a much smoother vocal than the original version. Brother Ernie Isley's Jimi Hendrix/Santana-inspired guitar solo was one of the major highlights of the song and one of the key elements of what defined the 3 + 3 era of the Isleys. The song became their first Top 10 pop single since 1969's \"It's Your Thing\" peaked at number two on the pop singles chart, reaching number six on the pop chart while also reaching number two on the US R&B Singles chart. It was also another cross-Atlantic hit for the group, reaching number fourteen in the UK. The song is ranked #357 on Rolling Stone's list of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"Think About It\" is a song by English singer-songwriter Melanie C from her fifth studio album, The Sea. It was released as the second single from the album on 4 September 2011 and was written by Adam Argyle and collaborative team Cutfather. The track was recorded in Copenhagen and was released after the single \"Rock Me\", prior to the release Melanie had spent time on the West-End Blood Brothers which she said helped her develop and evolve as an artist. The song is a dance-pop song and a departure from the usual rock-stance Melanie had taken in her career since 1999. It gathered comparisons to artists; Katy Perry, Kelly Clarkson and Pink. Lyrically the song discusses doing something that you know you shouldn't. Critically the song gathered near acclaim, and critics considered it a welcome change, and a better release than the previous, \"Rock Me\". Critics enjoyed her new-found pop style and found it to be a good introduction to her fifth studio album The Sea. Commercially the song was a moderate hit: in Austria, Switzerland and Germany with its highest peak being in the Swiss charts at number 30. A music video directed Howard Greenhalgh showed her perform against different backdrops and in different outfits throughout. Melanie C performed this on The Sea \u2013 Live tour."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"Till the World Ends\" is a song recorded by American singer Britney Spears for her seventh studio album, Femme Fatale (2011). It was written by Kesha Sebert, Lukasz \"Dr. Luke\" Gottwald, Alexander Kronlund, and Max Martin. Gottwald, Martin and Billboard produced the song, while vocal production was handled by Emily Wright. \"Till the World Ends\" is an uptempo dance-pop and electropop song with an electro beat. It opens with sirens, and has elements of trance and Eurodance. The song features a chant-like chorus, and lyrics in which Spears sings about dancing until the end of the world. \"Till the World Ends\" received comparisons to past hits by artists like Kesha and Enrique Iglesias. The song received universal critical acclaim, with critics calling it a catchy dance track and complimenting its anthemic nature. \"Till the World Ends\" was treated with different remixes, most notably the Femme Fatale Remix, featuring rapper Nicki Minaj and Kesha, which was released on April 25, 2011. The remix adds a rap by Minaj at the beginning, new vocals by Kesha, and a dubstep breakdown. The Femme Fatale Remix received positive reviews from critics, with most complimenting the diversity of the group and Minaj's rap. \"Till the World Ends\" charted on the top-ten in several major music markets, including Australia, France, Ireland, New Zealand, Sweden and Switzerland. The Femme Fatale Remix propelled the single to the top five on the Canadian Hot 100 and the US Billboard Hot 100. However, \"Till the World Ends\" became her second lowest peaking single in the United Kingdom. An accompanying music video for the \"Till the World Ends\" was released on April 6, 2011. It portrays Spears in an underground dance party set on a December 21, 2012. Critics noted the similarities with the music video for \"I'm a Slave 4 U\" (2001), and predominantly gave positive reviews for it. A choreography cut was released on April 15, 2011. The video was also nominated for two categories at the 2011 MTV Video Music Awards, and went on to win Best Pop Video. Spears has performed \"Till the World Ends\" on television shows Good Morning America and Jimmy Kimmel Live!, and performed it with Minaj at the 2011 Billboard Music Awards. She has also performed the song as the encore of the Femme Fatale Tour (2011) and Britney: Piece of Me (2013)."@en ;

It was one of The Miracles' earliest charting singles, reaching #94 on the Billboard Pop chart. Motown president Berry Gordy, Jr. had The Miracles record the song several times during its chart run. The first version had minimal orchestration. The second version added strings, and this is the version played by most oldies stations today. Claudette (Mrs. Smokey) Robinson had several lead parts on this song (as the \"lover way over there on the mountainside\"), answering Smokey's leads with chants of \"Come to me, Baby\". The song's B-side, \"(You Can) Depend on Me\", while not charting nationally, did become a popular regional hit in many areas of the country,and Smokey still sings it in his live shows today. \"Way Over There\" has inspired cover versions by Edwin Starr, The Temptations, The Marvelettes, The Royal Counts, The Spitballs, and Eddie Adams Jr, while \"(You Can) Depend on Me\" has inspired cover versions by The Temptations, The Supremes, Mary Wells, and Brenda Holloway.

Written by Ken Gold and Michael Denne and produced by Ken Gold, \"You to Me Are Everything\" was The Real Thing's sole number-one single in the UK Singles chart, spending three weeks at the top in July 1976. A remixed version of the song returned to the chart in March 1986 reaching number five. The song was a minor hit in the U.S. where it peaked at number 64 on the Billboard Hot 100 singles chart and number 28 on the Billboard R&B chart. One of the reasons for its lack of success in the U.S. was the flood of cover versions of the song released at the same time. American groups Broadway and Revelation both released versions of the song the same week, and at one point all three versions of the song appeared on Billboard Hot 100 and R&B charts. With radio and the public unable to agree on a single popular version, the three singles effectively prevented each other from becoming a hit.[citation needed] The song was subsequently covered by Frankie Valli, Sonia, Tiny Tim, Public Enemy, Sean Maguire and Andy Abraham. In 1997, the Italian song-writer Marina Rei successfully recorded \"Primavera\" (\"Spring\"), an Italian version of \"You to Me Are Everything\". A fennecized version entitled \"Ei enemp\u00E4\u00E4 voi pyyt\u00E4\u00E4\" was recorded in 1978 by Petri Pettersson. The song was very most popular in the Philippines."@en ;

Bush hadn't released a single since \"Sat in Your Lap\" thirteen months earlier. \"The Dreaming\" made it to #48 on the UK Singles Chart. The song is about the destruction of Aboriginal homelands by white Australians in their quest for weapons-grade uranium. Musical guest Rolf Harris plays the didgeridoo on the recording. Bird impersonator Percy Edwards provided sheep noises. The original title for the track was \"The Abo Song\", which unwittingly made use of a racial slur; promotional 12\" copies were circulated before being recalled.[citation needed] An alternative version of \"The Dreaming\", entitled \"Dreamtime\", was used as the UK single b-side. It is usually referred to as an instrumental version of \"The Dreaming\". This is not strictly true in that while the track omits all the sung lead vocal lyrics it still retains most of the backing vocals such as the stretched dreamtime harmonies heard during the chorus. It is also of note that \"Dreamtime\" contains both an extended intro and outro. It starts with approximately 4 bars of double-tracked didgeridoo drone before the original arrangement comes in and finishes with approximately 30 seconds of the same following a breakdown of the original arrangement."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"The Sound of Silence\" is a song by the American music duo Simon & Garfunkel. The song was written by Paul Simon over the period of several months between 1963 and 1964. A studio audition led to the duo signing a record deal with Columbia Records, and the song was recorded in March 1964 at Columbia Studios in New York City for inclusion on their debut studio album, Wednesday Morning, 3 A.M.. Released in October 1964, the album was a commercial failure and led to the duo breaking apart, with Paul Simon returning to England and Art Garfunkel to his studies at Columbia University. In spring 1965, the song began to attract airplay at radio stations in Boston, Massachusetts, and throughout Florida. The growing airplay led Tom Wilson, the song's producer, to remix the track, overdubbing electric instrumentation with the same musicians who backed Bob Dylan's \"Like a Rolling Stone\". Simon & Garfunkel were not informed of the song's remix until after its release. The single was released in September 1965. The song hit No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 for the week ending January 1, 1966, leading the duo to reunite and hastily record their second album, which Columbia titled Sounds of Silence in an attempt to capitalize on the song's success. The song was a top-ten hit in multiple countries worldwide, among them Australia, Austria, West Germany, Ireland, Japan and the Netherlands. Generally considered a classic folk rock song, the song was added to the National Recording Registry in the Library of Congress for being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically important\" in 2013 along with the rest of the Sounds of Silence album. Originally titled \"The Sounds of Silence\" on Wednesday Morning, 3 A.M., as well as on the single release and Sounds of Silence album, the song was re-titled for later compilations beginning with Simon and Garfunkel's Greatest Hits."@en ;

The song's composition and record production was inspired by the Motown Sound of the 1960s and the lyrics reflected a man's joy over the return of an old lover. The strong response from Motown executives upon hearing the song prompted the label to issue the song as the second single as a possible follow-up hit to \"Let's Get It On\". The song found major success though modestly compared to \"Let's Get It On\", reaching #21 on the Billboard Hot 100 and #3 on the Hot Soul Singles chart, selling over a quarter million copies. Gaye performed the song while appearing on Soul Train in 1974. The musician performed the song in its original sound during his 1974-1975 United States tour. Midway through the 1970s, Gaye altered the song as a warm-up to \"Let's Get It On\" performing it in a seductive blues-oriented style. This alteration would continue to be used until his final US tour in 1983. During a rehearsal of his Belgium concert in 1981, Gaye performed the song in its original version on piano. Among the cover versions of the song included versions by Nancy Wilson on her 1975 album of the same name and Joe covered the song on his 2009 album, Signature."@en ;

Selena promoted the song during her Amor Prohibido Tour, the song was included in every venue. Her final performance was on March 14, 1995 during her concert Calle Ocho Festival in Miami, Florida, which attracted over 100,000 fans. In an interview with La Naci\u00F3n, Selena said that she recorded the song because she believed her fans would appreciate her choice in Latin dance-pop and wanted to gain fans, who weren't acquainted with her music. \"El chico del apartamento 512\" was given mixed to positive reviews. Because the single was released a day prior to the murder of Selena, the event jeopardized any further developments for a music video, to further promote the song. \"El chico del apartamento 512\" debuted and peak on the US Billboard Regional Mexican Digital Songs chart on the week ending April 9, 2011.

The record was produced by noted production music and sound effects recording producer Thomas J. Valentino. It was one of the most popular and memorable pieces of music from the disco era. The \"Fifth\" in the song's title is a pun, referencing a liquid measure approximately equal to one-fifth of a gallon, a popular size for bottles containing hard liquor, as well as Beethoven's Fifth Symphony from which the song was adapted. The song, when released, entered the Billboard Hot 100 at number 80 on May 29, 1976, and took 19 weeks to reach number 1, where it stayed for one week becoming Murphy's best known work and his only Top 40 hit. Early in 1977, it was licensed to RSO Records for inclusion on the soundtrack to the movie Saturday Night Fever. Even though Murphy played nearly every instrument on the instrumental, his record company cautioned that the record would stand a better chance if credited to a group rather than an individual. To Murphy's annoyance, they came up with the name Walter Murphy and the Big Apple Band, only to discover two days after its release that there was already a Big Apple Band. The name on the label was changed to The Walter Murphy Band and then simply to Walter Murphy."@en ;

Adam Duritz said about that song (from Storytellers): \"I write quite a few songs where the sort of issue is faith\u2013having faith, keeping faith. And this song in particular is about the difficulty in having faith in things, and finding things to have faith in, in yourself, in God, in like he said, a woman. Faith is a weird thing, it in a sense it is all about waiting. It\u2019s not actually about getting anything, you know, faith is about the wait, because once you get something there is no need anymore. So a lot about faith is just the willingness to sort of throw yourself on a fence and hang there for a while. That\u2019s a very difficult and bitter thing, you know. In this song, I keep saying the main character, *I*, I said, \u201CAll my sins, I would pay for them if I could come back to you.\u201D It\u2019s not just about finding things to believe in, it\u2019s about wanting to be able to believe in anything too. And it\u2019s about all the voices that get inside your head and whisper for you to do it or not to do it as well.

It was the third single to be taken from the Your Arsenal album and was the third and final Morrissey single to be produced by glam rock legend Mick Ronson. Reaching number 35 in the UK Singles Chart, the song had the distinction of being Morrissey's lowest charting solo single up to that point. The track is in many ways a tribute to the influence of Marc Bolan on both Morrissey and his guitarist Boz Boorer, featuring a guitar line played by producer Mick Ronson that recalls \"Ride a White Swan\" by T. Rex. This was also the first Morrissey single to be released following the singer's bottling off stage at the Madstock festival when he supported Madness and the subsequent NME story regarding his alleged racism. This led to the single cover being changed from featuring the singer's name spelt out in the colours of the Union Jack to plain black writing. The video to the track was shot in Chicago."@en ;

The single is somewhat unusual because the song features no vocals from Memphis Bleek, the host of the song. The song only features vocals from featured guest, Jay-Z. At the time, Jay-Z was a retired rapper just making an appearance on his label-mate's song. The beat dropped and Jay began freestyling and they recorded the song when it was done without Bleek having rapped. He made the choice to give it to Jay-Z but still place it on his album and release it as a single. It was produced by Just Blaze. It contains a sample from Weldon Irvine's \"Morning Sunrise\". Jay-Z released his first song since beginning his brief \"retirement\". The song was called \"Dear Summer\", in reference to what Jay called the time of the year when he would drop a classic album or single every year for 8 straight years, and how he had to metaphorically leave \"her\", Summer.\"Jigga has some great rhymes about his decision to leave performance for his job as Def Jam's CEO\"(Gamboa, 2005, p.

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Doesn\u0027t_Really_Matter>	rdf:type	dbo:MusicalWork ;
	dbo:abstract	"\"Doesn't Really Matter\" is a song recorded by American singer-songwriter Janet Jackson for the soundtrack to the film Nutty Professor II: The Klumps (2000). It was written and produced by Jackson and Jam & Lewis. The song was released on May 21, 2000, after an unfinished version leaked to radio. \"Doesn't Really Matter\" is an electropop song which speaks about loving a person for who they are and disregarding their physical appearance. It was based on an incomplete poem Jackson had written, which was later applied to her character in the film. The song was a contrast from the bleak tone of prior album The Velvet Rope (1997), returning to a brighter and more contemporary sound. \"Doesn't Really Matter\" received positive reception, called \"impossibly catchy\" and \"classic pop\". It became Jackson's ninth number one in the United States and stayed atop the chart for three weeks, making her the first artist to have a number one hit in three separate decades. It was Jackson's twenty-first single to be certified, which ranked her as the second female artist with the most certified singles. The song fared well internationally, reaching number five in the United Kingdom, within the top ten in Italy and Denmark. It attained a silver certification in the United Kingdom, and allowed Jam and Lewis to receive a Grammy nomination for Producer of the Year. The single is featured in the fifth edition of the American Now! compilation album series Now That's What I Call Music! 5 (2000) and was later included in two of Jackson's greatest hits collections, Number Ones (2009) and Icon: Number Ones (2010). The music video, directed by Joseph Kahn, resembles an abstract, futuristic environment based on Japanese culture. It features advanced technology, morphing clothes, and a dance sequence on a levitating platform. The video had a reported cost of over $2.5 million, being one of the most expensive music videos of all time. Its accolades include \"Outstanding Music Video\" and \"Most Stylish Music Video\" at the VH1 Fashion Awards. The song was performed on Top of the Pops and the MTV Video Music Awards, the latter regarded as one of the leading performances of Jackson's career. A slightly modified version of the song appeared on Jackson's seventh studio album, All for You. \"Doesn't Really Matter\" was considered to influence music videos from Britney Spears, Mariah Carey, Jessica Simpson, and Cassie. The video was the first by director Joseph Kahn to feature Japanese themes and imagery, which he later used frequently following its popularity. Actress Jenna Dewan made one of her debut appearances in the video, crediting Jackson for the experience and platform to star in the dance film Step Up. Rihanna's \"Watch n' Learn\" was likened to the song, and it was also covered by Japanese singer Hitomi Shimatani as \"Papillon\"."@en ;

The song was performed at 1983 Monsters of Rock festival and was the only new song in the band's set, but the entire Slide It In album was supposed to be released in time for the festival. The song was just released, so that the band could have something to promote the new album. Notable is that the two songs on this single are the only released material from the first sessions for the Slide It In album with producer Eddie Kramer. Kramer was dismissed and the album re-recorded with Martin Birch as producer. A music video was also made, which is compiled from different live performances, some of which are taken from the 1983 Monsters of Rock show."@en ;

It was accompanied by a new music video which parodied musical performances of 1960s variety shows. The music video for \"In Bloom\" won Best Alternative Video at the MTV Video Music Awards in 1993."@en ;

The song caused controversy as its lyrics and music video parodies Michael Jackson, who was being accused of child molestation at the time. The song also pokes fun at Beavis/Cornholio, MC Hammer, Madonna, and others. It also heavily spoofs Pee-wee Herman, going as far as imitating his signature shout during the chorus and Eminem dressing like him in the video. The song reached number one in the United Kingdom, Australia and New Zealand, and number six in the United States Billboard Hot 100. Despite charting high, the song did not perform as well as his two previous lead singles, \"The Real Slim Shady\" (2000), and \"Without Me\" (2002)."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"Man! I Feel Like a Woman!\" is a song recorded by Canadian singer-songwriter Shania Twain taken from her third studio album, Come On Over (1997). Written by Twain with her longtime collaborator Robert John \"Mutt\" Lange, who also produced the track, the song was released first to North American country radio stations in March 1999 as the seventh single from the album, and later it was released worldwide in September 1999. \"Man! I Feel Like a Woman!\" is a country pop song with lyrics about female empowerment. The song received generally favorable reviews from music critics, who praised the song's attitude and hook as well as Twain's vocals. Commercially, the song was also successful, reaching the top-ten in six countries, while reaching the top-twenty in Canada and number 23 on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart. It was even more successful on the Hot Country Songs chart, reaching the top-five and was certified Gold by the RIAA for 500,000 digital downloads. The song also won a Grammy for Best Female Country Vocal Performance in 2000. The accompanying music video for \"Man! I Feel Like a Woman!\" was released on March 3, 1999, and it pays homage to Robert Palmer's \"Addicted to Love\" music video, featuring Twain dancing with buffed and blank-eyed male models. The song was the opening song on both Twain's Come On Over Tour and the Up! Tour as well as Twain's headline on the Super Bowl XXXVII Halftime show. It was also used to comic effect in a 2004 Chevy Colorado TV commercial, as well as being on the soundtrack of Brazilian telenovela La\u00E7os de Fam\u00EDlia and the director's cut version of comedy action film Alaska Hillbily Hell.

dbr:Material_Girl	rdf:type	dbo:MusicalWork ;
	dbo:abstract	"\"Material Girl\" is a song by American singer Madonna from her second studio album Like a Virgin (1984). It was released on November 30, 1984 by Sire Records as the second single from the album. It also appears slightly remixed on the 1990 greatest hits compilation, The Immaculate Collection, and in its original form on the 2009 greatest hits compilation, Celebration. The song was written by Peter Brown and Robert Rans, while Nile Rodgers produced the track. Madonna explained that the concept of the song was indicative of her life at that time. She felt that \"Material Girl\" was provocative in its content and was attracted to it. \"Material Girl\" consists of synth arrangements with a robotic voice repeating the hook. The lyrics identify with materialism, with Madonna asking for a rich and affluent life, rather than romance and relationships. Contemporary critics have frequently identified \"Material Girl\" along with \"Like a Virgin\" as the songs that established Madonna as an icon. \"Material Girl\" was a commercial success, reaching the top-five in Australia, Belgium, Canada, Ireland, Japan and United Kingdom. It reached the number two position on the Billboard Hot 100 in the United States, becoming her third top-five single there. The music video was a mimicry of Marilyn Monroe's performance of the song \"Diamonds Are a Girl's Best Friend\" from the 1953 film Gentlemen Prefer Blondes. The mimicked scenes are interspersed with scenes of a Hollywood director trying to win the heart of an actress, played by Madonna herself. Discovering that, contrary to her song, the young woman was not impressed by money and expensive gifts, he pretended to be penniless and succeeded in taking her out on a date. She has performed the song in five of her world tours; most of her performances of the song on tour are mimicries of the song's music video. \"Material Girl\" has been covered by a number of artists, including Britney Spears, The Chipettes and Hilary and Haylie Duff. It has appeared in the films Moulin Rouge! (2001) and Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason (2004). Madonna has often remarked that she regrets recording \"Material Girl\" as its title became a nickname for her in the mainstream media. The song has been labeled an empowering influence for women, and was the subject of debates."@en ;

The lyrics as well as a \"mellow, piano-driven beat\" has caused Dan Menella to call it the most memorable track on Common's third album. Kevin Powell of Rolling Stone considers it to be the centerpiece of its album, and Leo Stanley of Allmusic similarly boasts of its significant emotional impact. Lauryn Hill's verse embodies portions of \"Never Dreamed You'd Leave in Summer\" by Stevie Wonder, while the song's beat samples \"A Song for You\" by Donny Hathaway. A music video directed by Lauryn Hill was made for it. Two of its b-sides, \"Invocation\" and \"Hungry,\" received low budget music videos."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"The Cowboys' Christmas Ball\" is a Country Christmas song recorded by Las Vegas rock band The Killers. The lyrics of the song were taken from the 1890 poem of the same name by William Lawrence Chittenden. John Lomax included the lyrics to this song in his book \"Cowboy Songs\" (copyright 1910) with these notes: \"This poem was one of Larry Chittenden's Ranch Verses, published by GP Putnam's Sons, New York, has been set to music by cowboys and its phraseology slightly changed, as this copy will show, by oral transmission. I have heard it in New Mexico and it has been sent to me from various places,- always as a song. None of those who sent in the song knew that it was already in print.\"The Killers version has slight lyrical changes. For instance, the first line was changed from \"Way out in Western Texas, where the Clear Fork's waters flow\" to \"Way out in Old Nevada, where the Truckees' waters flow\". The song was released as a digital download on November 30, 2011, the video was released a day later. All proceeds from the song go to AIDS charities as part of the Product Red campaign, headed by Bono and Bobby Shriver. It is the band's sixth annual Christmas song and was released as the lead single off their compilation EP, (RED) Christmas EP. The song was also recorded by Michael Martin Murphey on his CD \"Cowboy Christmas\" (Cowboy Songs II)."@en ;

The song was written by Swift and Liz Rose, and produced by Nathan Chapman. It was released on June 19, 2006 by Big Machine Records as Swift's debut single and the lead single from Swift's eponymous debut album. Swift wrote \"Tim McGraw\" during her freshman year of high school, knowing that she and her senior boyfriend, Drew Dunlap, would break up at the end of the year when he left for college. The song was written about all the different things that would remind Dunlap of Swift and their time spent together, once he departed. \"Tim McGraw\" is musical interconnection of traditional and modern country music. Lyrically, the track lists items in order to associate a past relationship, one of them being country artist Tim McGraw's music. The song was received with critical praise from music critics who complimented Swift's vocal delivery. Some critics described it as tender, while others admired its professionalism. \"Tim McGraw\" performed well commercially. The track spent numbers of weeks upon both the Billboard Hot 100 and Hot Country Songs in the United States. It peaked at number 40 on the former and number six on the latter. The single was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) and has sold more than one million copies since its release. The accompanying music video for \"Tim McGraw\", directed by Trey Fanjoy, comprises flashbacks by Swift's love interest, among cut scenes that feature Swift lying on a lake bed. \"Tim McGraw\" was promoted by Swift on a radio tour and performances in numerous venues. Swift performed it while serving as opening act for various country artists' concert tours. She also performed it as part of her first headlining concert tour, the Fearless Tour (2009\u201310)."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"Get Me Bodied\" is a song recorded by American singer Beyonc\u00E9 for her second studio album, B'Day (2006). It was written by Beyonc\u00E9, Kasseem \"Swizz Beatz\" Dean, Sean Garrett, Makeba Riddick, Angela Beyinc\u00E9, and Solange Knowles, while the production was handled by Dean, Beyonc\u00E9 Knowles and Sean Garrett. Beyonc\u00E9 was inspired by her sister, Solange, and former Destiny's Child band-mates Kelly Rowland and Michelle Williams for the writing process. Columbia Records released \"Get Me Bodied\" as the album's seventh and final single in the US on July 10, 2007. \"Get Me Bodied\" is an R&B and bounce song with dancehall and reggae influences. It features Beyonc\u00E9 as the female protagonist going out an evening in the right dress and the right hair, to steam up any dance floor and make sure her call to \"get her bodied\" is irresistible. The song was generally well received by contemporary music critics, who complimented its party sound and Beyonc\u00E9's vocals. The American Society of Composers, Authors, and Publishers (ASCAP) recognized it as the best R&B and Hip-Hop song of 2007. \"Get Me Bodied\" initially reached number 68 on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart in 2007, but due to a viral video reached a new peak of 46 in 2013. Its accompanying music video was co-directed by Beyonc\u00E9 and Anthony Mandler, and inspired by The Frug from Bob Fosse's film adaptation of the Broadway musical Sweet Charity. Solange, Rowland, and Williams make cameo appearances. The clip was nominated for Video of the Year at the 2007 VH1 Soul Vibe Awards. \"Get Me Bodied\" was promoted by Beyonc\u00E9 with live performances on her world tours and at the 2007 BET Awards. In April 2011, Beyonc\u00E9 re-recorded the song and re-titled it as \"Move Your Body\" for the Let's Move! Flash Workout campaign. An instructional video of the exercise routine was filmed for distribution to participating schools."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"I'm a Slave 4 U\" is a song recorded by American singer Britney Spears for her third studio album, Britney (2001). It was written and produced by Chad Hugo and Pharrell Williams (known collectively as The Neptunes). The song was released on September 24, 2001, by JIVE Records, as the lead single of Britney. The urban song, has a similar soundscape to Vanity 6's 1982's song \"Nasty Girl\", while its lyrics talks about being a slave to the music. \"I'm a Slave 4 U\" garnered mixed reception from music critics. Some critics argued it was the singer's most mature sound at the time compared to her previous singles, while other noticed the song's attempt to leave behind Spears' girl next door image and said her vocals were unnatural. \"I'm a Slave 4 U\" achieved commercial success, peaking inside the top-ten in almost every country that it charted on. However, the song peaked at number 27 on the Billboard Hot 100 and at number 85 in Billboard Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs, both being the lowest chart positions of the single worldwide. A music video for the single, which was directed by Francis Lawrence, was released along with the single released. It features Spears dancing in a sauna. Spears' performance of the song at the 2001 MTV Video Music Awards in New York City was highly criticized by animal rights group PETA for the inclusion of exotic animals. Spears performed the song on every tour since its release, including the promotional The M+M's Tour. The song was also featured on the 2002 compilation album Now That's What I Call Music! 9."@en ;

It was released on December 6, 1999, by JIVE Records, as the fourth single from the album. Before recording the song, Spears had to ask the writers of the song, Andreas Carlsson and Kristian Lundin, to re-write it, since it was a sexual song. The singer first recorded her vocals in March 1998, and re-recorded them later on the same year. The dance-pop and teen pop song alludes to a relationship that a woman desires to correct, not quite understanding what went wrong, as she comes to realize that she was \"born to make [her lover] happy\". \"Born to Make You Happy\" received mixed reviews from critics, who praised it for being an early classic and a proficient single, despite considering the song as entirely unremarkable like other ballads on the album. The song was commercially successful worldwide, peaking at number one in Ireland, and reaching top five positions in Belgium, Europe, Finland, Germany, Netherlands, Norway, Sweden and Switzerland. In the United Kingdom, it also peaked at number one, and is Spears' sixth best-selling single in the country. An accompanying music video was directed by Billie Woodruff, and portrays Spears dreaming that she is with her lover, while she sings and dances during the majority of the video. Spears has performed \"Born to Make You Happy\" on four concert tours."@en ;

It was released on December 15, 1999 by JIVE Records as the fifth and final single from the album. After Spears recorded an unused song from Toni Braxton and sent it through Larry Rudolph to several labels, executives from JIVE Records commented that it was very rare to hear someone so young who could deliver emotional content and commercial appeal, appointing the singer to work with producer Eric Foster White. The teen pop ballad was written and produced by White, and features Spears singing about the loss of a first love and how breaking up can be hard. \"From the Bottom of My Broken Heart\" received mixed to positive reviews from music critics, who noted the song as a classic hit and competent single, despite considering it unremarkable like other ballads on the album and calling it \"another rejection ballad that refers to kissing but nothing else\". \"From the Bottom of My Broken Heart\" achieved moderate success, peaking at number 37 in Australia, and 23 in New Zealand. Through imports, the song managed to peak at number 174 in the United Kingdom. In the United States, \"From the Bottom of My Broken Heart\" reached number 14 on Billboard Hot 100, and 17 on Pop Songs, being later certified Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) on March 28, 2000, for shipping 1,000,000 physical units of the single. It was the 8th best-selling physical single of the 2000s in the country. An accompanying music video, directed by Gregory Dark, was released on December 17, 1999. It portrayed Spears packing her belongings as she readies herself to move away from home, and feeling upset because she knows that she is going to miss her first love. The video was the subject of controversy among the press, who panned the singer for hiring an adult filmmaker to direct her video. A Spears representative commented that they were only aware of Dark doing music videos. The singer performed \"From the Bottom of My Broken Heart\" in a few live appearances, including at the 2000 Grammy Awards, in a medley with \"...Baby One More Time\", and in three of her concert tours."@en ;

dbr:He_Is	rdf:type	dbo:MusicalWork ;
	dbo:abstract	"\"He Is\" is a song by American singer Brandy Norwood from her third studio album Full Moon (2002). It was written by Warryn Campbell, Harold Lilly and Norwood, with production handled by the former two. Conceived during spiritual discussions with Norwood, Campbell and Lilly conceptualized the pop- and R&B-influenced ballad secretly as a soul song as they were keen to hear her sing a religious track, a genre which Norwood declined to record at that time. Lyrically speaking about God in third person, Norwood was unaware, \"He Is\" was not a relationship song when she recorded her vocals for it. The song was released as the album's third and final single in September 2002. It received a mixed reception by music critics, many of whom applauded Norwood's vocal performance and the sparse production, but dismissed \"He Is\" as a weak single choice. Commercially, the track failed to reprise the success of the album's previous singles \"What About Us?\" and \"Full Moon\"; while the track failed to chart on the Billboard Hot 100 in the United States, it reached number 78 on the official Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Singles & Tracks chart. Norwood, who was well into her pregnancy at the time of its release, was unavailable to promote the single or film a music video."@en ;

This concept of 'betterment for all' would become a centerpiece for the Dangerous World Tour. In the documentary Living with Michael Jackson, Jackson said he created the song in his \"Giving Tree\" at Neverland Ranch. An ensemble performance of \"We Are the World\" and \"Heal the World\" closed Jackson's memorial service at the Staples Center in Los Angeles on July 7, 2009. The song was performed as rehearsed by Jackson at the venue just weeks earlier, in preparation for his planned \"This Is It\" concerts in London along with \"Dirty Diana\". R&B singer Ciara sang the song as a tribute to Jackson at the 2009 BET Awards. The song was played at the funeral of James Bulger, and Jackson also donated the song to be used as the anthem for the charity the James Bulger Red Balloon Center, a school for children to go to if they are being bullied or have learning difficulties."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"How Do I Live\" is a song written by Diane Warren. It was originally performed by LeAnn Rimes from her album You Light Up My Life: Inspirational Songs in 1997 and later performed by Trisha Yearwood. Both versions were released on May 27, 1997. In the U.S., Rimes's version peaked at No. 2 for four non-consecutive weeks in late 1997 and early 1998, behind \"Candle in the Wind 1997\" by Elton John, and \"Truly Madly Deeply\" by Savage Garden. It set a record for staying on the Billboard Hot 100 chart for 69 weeks, a record it held until \"I'm Yours\" by Jason Mraz set a new record of 76 weeks. The Rimes recording also set the record for the most time in the Billboard Hot 100's top 10 at 32 consecutive weeks, and the record for Billboard Hot 100's top 40 at 62 consecutive weeks; both records still hold. It ranks at No. 4 on Billboard's All Time Top 100, the only single on the top 10 of this list not peaking at No. 1. The only songs that finished ahead of it were Bobby Darin's cover of \"Mack the Knife\", Santana's song \"Smooth\", and Chubby Checker's version of \"The Twist\". It has been certified 3\u00D7 Platinum by the RIAA for shipments of 3 million copies in the United States, the highest certified country single of that time, to be surpassed twelve years later by \"Love Story\" from artist Taylor Swift, which has been certified 8\u00D7 Platinum. Despite only peaking as high as No. 7 in the UK Singles Chart, Rimes' version of \"How Do I Live\" spent 34 weeks on the chart, ending up as the 6th best selling single of 1998. As of August 2014, the song has sold 710,000 copies in the UK. \"How Do I Live\" was also covered by F.I.R. (Faye and Real featuring LeAnn Rimes). F.I.R. invited Rimes to record a portion of the song for their third album Flight Tribe in 2006."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"Little 15\" is a Depeche Mode single, released on 16 May 1988[citation needed], and the fourth single from the album Music for the Masses. The song was never intended to be a single; in fact, it barely made it onto the album, but a French record label wanted to release the song as a single, which became a popular import and a minor hit in the UK, reaching #60 on the UK Singles Chart (to date the second lowest UK singles placing for the band). The song's title, as well as its status as a minor release, contributed to its special catalog number \"LITTLE15\". In this vein, it can be seen as a \"little\" release between BONG15 (\"Behind the Wheel\") and BONG16 (\"Everything Counts [Live]\"). Ironically, \"Little 15\" didn't chart in France, but finally was also released as a single in other countries becoming a success: in West Germany, where it hit #16, in Austria where it reached #25 and in Switzerland where it entered the Top 20 at #18. There was no remix of the song at the time of release (the 12\" and 7\" versions were the same); however, there are two piano instrumental B-sides, both performed by Alan Wilder. The first is \"Stj\u00E4rna\" (mislabelled \"St. Jarna\"), which is Swedish for 'star', written by Martin Gore. The 12\" B-side also contains a performance of Ludwig van Beethoven's \"Moonlight Sonata #14.\" According to his website, Wilder did not intend for it to be a B-side, as he was merely performing it for fun, but Gore stealthily recorded it. Wilder did not perform the song perfectly (his error occurs near the end of the song). The music video for \"Little 15\" was directed by Martyn Atkins, who had done previous design work for the band.

The song has a wide variety of references, most notably the destruction of the Aztec empire by the Spanish (see the article Five suns) and the Zoot Suit Riots of Los Angeles in 1943. De La Rocha also refers to the last Aztecan Emperor Cuauht\u00E9moc, who was tortured and eventually executed by the Spaniards. The single artwork of the corn, sickle and ammunition belt is a 1927 photograph taken by Italian photographer Tina Modotti in Mexico. The final version of the song made its live d\u00E9but on May 9, 1996, in Paris, France."@en ;

Incorporating elements of hip hop and 1970s-style quiet storm as well as soul music, it features a sample from the 1976 song \"You Are Number One\", penned by Zyah Ahmonuel and performed by The Whispers. Following the less successful chart performances of previous singles \"All Eyez on Me\" and \"Too Hood\", J Records released the song on April 8, 2003 as the lead single form After the Storm in the United States. The song was lauded by critics, who praised its vintage touches and sparse hip hop\u2013influences. \"So Gone\" became Monica's biggest commercial success in years, reaching number 10 on the US Billboard Hot 100 and the top of both the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Singles & Tracks and Hot Dance Club Play charts, becoming her first chart topper since 1998's \"The First Night\". The song's music video, directed by Chris Robinson and shot at Miami's South Beach in April 2003, features Monica as one half of a dysfunctional relationship in which she prejudges her man to cheat on her.

Miller expounded on this in the Music for the Masses re-master documentary DVD, stating he felt the original single version was too complicated and would benefit from being simplified.

	dbo:abstract	"\"Ups & Downs\"/\"Bang Out\" is the fourth single of Snoop Dogg's album R&G (Rhythm & Gangsta) The Masterpiece. It is the first one that wasn't produced by The Neptunes. As being a mix of apparently two different tracks from the album that are \"Ups & Downs\" and \"Bang Out\" they shouldn't be handled as one. This is a song that interpolates The Bee Gees' 1979 hit \"Love You Inside Out\". It has a very different sound with a slower Beats per minute rate that are more characteristic of Snoop Dogg and of the album as a whole. Upon release, the single received some criticism Rolling Stone | Music News, Reviews, Photos, Videos, Interviews and More due to re-using the sample which had been used only 2 years earlier by Jay-Z and R. Kelly in \"Honey\" from their Best of Both Worlds project. Although the vocal is credited to Shon Don with the Bee Gees it wasn't recorded with the performers together and like so it can be considered as a tribute in honour of the original artists instead. Because the track contains a sample with an early British sound it became popular in Europe in the first place. In some prints of the cover of the R&G album the introductory sentence of \"Ups & Downs\" \"Every Dogg Has His Day\" is indicated as a separate interlude that sample from the motion picture \"Scarface\". However with or without it the length of the track remains four minutes seven seconds long. It was performed by Snoop Dogg at the Live 8 concert in London on July 2, 2005. Its lyrics on the part of the chorus was quite suitable for a charity event. (See lyrics) The premier of video for the single was first aired on Friday, April 29 at 7:30 p.m. on BET."@en .

On the Limited 12\", there are pictures of all four members. \"World in My Eyes\" has two exclusive B-sides, making Violator the only Depeche Mode album with all four singles having at least one exclusive B-Side, including instrumentals. The B-sides for \"World in My Eyes\" are \"Happiest Girl\" and \"Sea of Sin\". \"Happiest Girl (Jack Mix)\" and \"Sea of Sin (Tonal Mix)\" are the main 7\" versions. \"Original\" versions were never released, or rather, these mixes are the regular versions, according to interviews and the official website. Reaching No.17 in UK, and only No.52 on the Hot 100, it is the least successful single from Violator. The 2004 re-release of the EU single includes a longer-intro version of \"World in My Eyes (Oil Tank Mix)\"."@en ;

dbr:You_Have_Killed_Me	rdf:type	dbo:MusicalWork ;
	dbo:abstract	"\"You Have Killed Me\" is the first single from the album Ringleader of the Tormentors by Morrissey. The single was released on 27 March 2006. The title track was written by Morrissey and Jesse Tobias. Morrissey said it would showcase the \"marked difference in sound\" brought about by the new influence of Tobias on Morrissey's work while Billboard magazine described it as a \"simple, effective first single.\" The lyrics reference Pier Paolo Pasolini's 1961 film, Accattone, about prostitution in the slums of Rome, as is shown in the first two lines of the lyrics (\"Pasolini is me\"/\"Accattone you'll be\"). There is much speculation as to the meaning of this quote. Some fans believe that it is merely an example of Rome's influence on Morrissey whereas some believe that it is a reference to the loss of virginity, since Accattone is Pasolini's first film. A picture of Terence Stamp, main character of Pasolini's movie Teorema, was also chosen by Morrissey as cover of one of The Smiths early singles, \"What Difference Does It Make?\". The lyrics also mention Anna Magnani, Luchino Visconti, and in some live performances Fellini. The references to Anna Magnani and Luchino Visconti probably refer to the Visconti's segment of the anthology film Siamo Donne, in which actresses are shown in their everyday lives, rather than as glamorous or sexualised. Anna Magnani frequently portrayed ordinary women who sacrificed everything for her family as in Visconti's Bellissima or Pasolini's Mamma Roma."@en ;

dbr:All_Is_Full_of_Love	rdf:type	dbo:MusicalWork ;
	dbo:abstract	"\"All Is Full of Love\" is a song by Icelandic musician Bj\u00F6rk and is from her fourth studio album, Homogenic (1997). The lyrics are inspired by the presence of love in the advent of spring and Norse mythology's Ragnar\u00F6k. The more popular version of the track, the original mix solely produced by Bj\u00F6rk, was used in the music video but did not appear in the album. The album version is a remix by Howie B and has a minimalist approach and places emphasis on the singer's vocals. The video features a combination of electronic beats and string instruments. A remix by the German IDM duo Funkst\u00F6rung was released as a single in the summer of 1998. The song later received a full single release in June 1999 to coincide with the release of its music video. While some commentators declared that the song was one of the highlights of the Homogenic album, the single performed moderately on the UK Singles Chart, peaking at number 24. In the United States it was a dance hit. The song and music video were released two years after the release of the album for artistic merit rather than promotional purposes. The song was included as the opening track in the compilation album Greatest Hits (2002), whose tracks were selected by fans through a survey. \"All Is Full of Love\" is regarded by some as the first DVD single. The accompanying music video, \"All Is Full of Love\" was directed by Chris Cunningham and depicts the assembling of a robot with Bj\u00F6rk's features and her passionately kissing another robot against an ethereal and sterile backdrop. The song's video garnered acclaim from critics and is commonly regarded as one of the best music videos of all time and a milestone in computer animation. The subject of much analysis and scrutiny, it was on permanent display at the Museum of Modern Art in New York City and has been included in various art exhibitions. Bj\u00F6rk has performed \"All Is Full of Love\" in five of her tours, with the most recent being the Vulnicura Tour. It is one of Bj\u00F6rk's most idiosyncratic songs, and has been covered by various artists."@en ;

The song was written by Michael Masser and Will Jennings and was released in August 1987. It received a Grammy nomination for Song of the Year. Originally, another song was to be released as the second single, \"For the Love of You,\" but Arista Records decided to release \"Didn't We Almost Have It All\" instead because all Houston's singles had to be original material at this point of her career. The single was number one for two weeks on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart even though there was not a video for the song. A live performance of the song recorded during Houston's successful 1987\u20131988 Moment of Truth World Tour was played on MTV, VH1, and BET. The performance is from her September 2, 1987 concert in Saratoga Springs, New York. The recorded performance was also televised along with her performance of \"I Wanna Dance With Somebody\" at the 1987 MTV Video Music Awards on September 11.

	dbo:abstract	"\"For Those About to Rock (We Salute You)\" is a song by the Australian hard rock band AC/DC. The song was first released on AC/DC's eighth studio album For Those About to Rock We Salute You in 1981, and later as a single in 1982. The single's B-side contains an edited live version of \"Let There Be Rock\", recorded in Landover, Maryland, in late-1981. The video to \"For Those About to Rock (We Salute You)\" was filmed at that same concert. The song was later included on AC/DC's first soundtrack album, Who Made Who, released in 1986 for the Stephen King film Maximum Overdrive. The title and central lyric of the song are based on an ancient salute used by Roman prisoners to be executed in the Colosseum, \"Ave, Caesar, morituri te salutant\" (\"Hail Caesar, we who are about to die, salute you.\"). However, Angus Young later said that the inspiration for the cannons came from a very different source. The band was cutting the first recordings of the song on the same day as Princess Diana of Great Britain's televised wedding. Angus recalled that \"someone had the wedding on in the next room ... we were playing that part of the song when the cannons were going off and we paused a second and went 'hmmm ... that actually sounds pretty good.'\"[citation needed] This coincidence also led to a cannon being featured on the cover of the album and single, as well as life-sized Napoleonic cannons becoming a regular stage prop at AC/DC concerts. The cannons fired in the song are mixed with exploding fireworks. However the actual takes were recorded later the next month as the mobile truck used to record the album (Mobile One) was being used to record Peter Gabriel's 4th eponymous album during the marriage of Charles and Diana. AC/DC have often used the song to close live concerts, such as Live at Donington and No Bull as well as on their live CD AC/DC Live. It is also the song that concludes the most recent tour, Rock or Bust."@en ;

It was released by Arista Records in November that year, as the album's third single. Composed by George Merrill and Shannon Rubicam, the song was originally intended for Janet Jackson, but she passed on it. Houston then recorded the song with altered lyrics and production from Narada Michael Walden. The lyrics speak about the protagonist trying to discern if a boy she likes will ever like her back. \"How Will I Know\" received mainly positive reviews. The song became Houston's second number one single on the United States Billboard Hot 100. It spent two weeks atop the chart and also became Houston's first chart topper on the Canadian RPM Singles Chart. Success was worldwide: it reached the top 10 in Sweden, Ireland, Norway, and the United Kingdom, and the top 20 in the Netherlands, New Zealand, and Switzerland. The song's music video features scenes of Houston dancing in a setting of video screens and colored partitions. The music video gave Houston exposure to the teens and MTV. It also received nominations at the 1986 MTV Video Music Awards in the categories of Best Female Video and Best New Artist in a Video, winning the former category.

The song was written about the pain and loss Clapton felt following the death of his four-year-old son, Conor. In an interview with Sue Lawley in 1992, Clapton said of the song \"There is a song that I\u2019ve written for a movie, but in actual fact it was in the back of my head but it didn\u2019t really have a reason for being until I was scoring this movie which I did a little while ago and then it sort of had a reason to be. And it is a little ambiguous because it could be taken to be about Conor but it also is meant to be part of the film.\" Conor fell from a window of a 53rd-floor New York apartment building owned by his mother's friend on March 20, 1991. Clapton arrived at the apartment shortly after the accident."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"The Star Spangled Banner\" is a charity single recorded by American singer Whitney Houston to raise funds for soldiers and families of those involved in the Persian Gulf War. Written by Francis Scott Key, \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" is the National Anthem of the United States. The musical arrangement for Whitney Houston's rendition was by conductor John Clayton. The recording was produced by music coordinator Rickey Minor, along with Houston herself. The recording was included in the 2014 CD/DVD release, Whitney Houston Live: Her Greatest Performances and the U.S. edition of the 2000 release, Whitney: The Greatest Hits. Traditionally performed at sports games in the U.S., \"The Star Spangled Banner\" was performed by Houston at the now demolished Tampa Stadium for Super Bowl XXV in 1991. Houston donated her portion of the proceeds. After the September 11, 2001 attacks, Arista Records re-released Houston's \"The Star Spangled Banner\". She once again donated her share of the royalties, as did Arista Records, towards the firefighters and victims of the terrorist attacks. This time the single peaked at #6 on the US Hot 100, and was certified platinum by the RIAA. This made Houston the first musical act to take the national anthem Top 10 in the US, and have it certified platinum. The 2001 re-release of the single was Houston's last Top Ten hit on the US Hot 100 during her lifetime."@en .

The song was released as the first single off the studio album on 8 November 2002 by Epic Records and Daylight Records.

The song was co-written by her while she was staying at her home in Sydney, Australia for the production of the studio album, as well as written and producing four other songs together. Though many of the public consider this as Goodrem's breakthrough single, it is not her debut single. As the song features instrumentation with a piano, guitars (acoustic and electric) and drums, the song is a low tempo pop song, with influences of piano pop and pop rock. Lyrically, it talks about taking chances and leading your independence. The song was universally praised from music critics, praising Goodrem's vocal abilities and lyrical content. The song is considered as Goodrem's signature song, as the song managed to enter charts around the world, including two number ones in her native Australia and New Zealand. The song also peaked at number three in the United Kingdom, her first single to chart outside of the Oceania. It also charted in many European countries including Ireland, Switzerland and Germany.

	dbo:abstract	"\"I'm Too Sexy\" is the debut song by British group Right Said Fred. The single peaked at number two on the UK Singles Chart. Outside the United Kingdom, \"I'm Too Sexy\" topped the charts in six countries, including Australia, the Republic of Ireland and the United States. The single equalled the record for the most weeks at number two on the UK Singles Chart without ever topping the chart, staying at number two for six weeks in a row while being famously held off the summit by Bryan Adams' \"(Everything I Do) I Do It for You\" (this equalled the previous record set by Father Abraham's 1978 hit \"The Smurf Song\"). The band is considered a one-hit wonder in the United States, their only other charting United States single peaking at No. 76. However, \"I'm Too Sexy\" was just the act's first of several hits in their native United Kingdom, and they would have a number one single on the UK Singles Chart with \"Deeply Dippy\" in April 1992. In April 2008, the song was rated No. 49 on \"The 50 Worst Songs Ever! Watch, Listen and Cringe!\" by Blender. In June 2007, the song was listed as No. 80 on the VH1's 100 Greatest Songs of the 90s. In April 2011, it was ranked No. 2 on VH1's 40 Greatest One-Hit Wonders of the 90s."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"Sun Dance\" is a song by Tomahawk from their 2007 album, Anonymous. It is the ninth song on the album and it was released as a digital download single in iTunes. The song is influenced by traditional tribal songs that were sung by Native Americans during the Sun Dance celebration. The B-side, \"El Tecolote\", is an instrumental piece. Unlike most of the album tracks of Anonymous, which incorporate hard rock or experimental elements into their interpretation, \"El Tecolote\" seems to be a straightforward rendition of the source material. Sun Dance's lyrics feature only a chorus and chanting. The main body of the song that includes the chanting is very low and creepy,[citation needed] whereas the chorus is heavy metal, featuring distorted vocals, similar to the style of Mr. Bungle, one of Mike Patton's other bands. El Tecolote is a small town on the Mexican coast, and the song is thought to represent the atmosphere of that place. The single cover does not feature the name Sun Dance; however, it does mimic an old Wild West wanted poster, stating the band, their names, and a reward of 10,000,000 dollars."@en ;

The song was recorded in 32 takes on August 20, 1963 at the RCA studio in Los Angeles, although not released until over a year later. The backing band on the single consisted of trumpeter John Anderson, bassist Harper Cosby, trombonist John \"Streamline\" Ewing, drummer June Gardner, saxophonist Jewell Grant, violinist Darel Terwilliger, and guitarists Ren\u00E9 Hall and Bobby Womack. It was not initially much of a commercial success, charting no higher than 93 on the Billboard Hot 100. By Cooke's personal standards it was similarly low, especially when compared to his previous and following singles (\"Good Times\" and \"Shake\", respectively), both of which were comfortably in the Top 20. However, the song has garnered a respectable amount of critical acclaim in the decades since. It is ranked 876th in American music critic Dave Marsh's 1989 list, The Heart of Rock and Soul: The 1001 Greatest Singles Ever Made. \"That's Where It's At\" has been covered by such artists as Van Morrison, Ray Charles and Bobby Womack, among others."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"Uncle Sam Goddamn\" is the second single from Brother Ali's second full-length album The Undisputed Truth. The single was released on May 4, 2007 as a 12\" vinyl. There are three different editions of the single; a red version, a white version and a blue version each containing a different B-side. The song features a blues-influenced beat produced by Ant to assist its \"bitingly critical\" lyrics. Its lyrics harshly condemn the United States government for its past involvement in slavery and the crack cocaine trade, and its failure to provide for the poor. Its music video contains controversial images of cross burning, lynching and police brutality alongside images of American landmarks like the White House and Capitol building. Brother Ali has been under pressure from the recording industry due to lyrics from this song, claiming creative interference from \"somebody I don't wanna name, but some of you probably has their cell phones.\" The unnamed corporation ultimately withdrew its sponsorship of Ali, causing him to truncate parts of his 2007 tour. Furthermore, on the song \"Second Time Around\" with Benzi and Wale, Ali makes references to being kicked off a tour followed by the line \"Verizon dissed me too, cuz I was too political.\" The song is notably critical of the United States government, with accusations that the political system is addicted to war. The introduction, in which Brother Ali says, \"The name of this song is Uncle Sam Goddamn. It's a show tune, but the show ain't been written for it yet,\" is an allusion to Nina Simone's \"Mississippi Goddam.\""@en ;

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Motorhead_(Mot\u00F6rhead_song)>	rdf:type	dbo:MusicalWork ;
	dbo:abstract	"\"Motorhead\" is the eponymous song of the British hard rock band of the same name. It was originally recorded by the space rock band Hawkwind, of whom the song's author, Mot\u00F6rhead frontman Ian \"Lemmy\" Kilmister, had been a member from 1971 to 1975. It was the last song that he had written for them, but it had only been released as the B-side of the single \"Kings of Speed\", in March 1975. In May of that year, Lemmy was fired from Hawkwind and formed a new band, naming it after the song. It indicated the direction in which he planned to go: hard rock, not space rock. Mot\u00F6rhead recorded two new versions of the song later that year, one as part of a demo session with producer Dave Edmunds and then another as part of the sessions for what was meant to have been Mot\u00F6rhead's debut album. However, their record label, United Artists Records, decided to shelve the project and dropped the band without releasing any of the material. Over a year later, the song was recorded yet again for Chiswick Records, during the session for their actual debut album and was released ahead of it, in June 1977, as their second 7\" single. Initially issued with the Map of Chiswick label, it was later switched to the Big Beat label and pressed in other formats. The reverse cover is taken up almost entirely with the song's lyrics, printed in a lowercase form of blackletter. Most of the original singles have the words \"a porky prime cut\" inscribed on the run-out groove, indicating that the record was mastered by George Peckham. A variety of supporting messages also appear.[clarification needed] Chiswick also released a special 12\" vinyl edition which was limited to 12,500 copies, it has the same sleeve, tracks and catalogue number \u2013 Chiswick S13. On April 28, 1979 Lemmy was interviewed by John Tobler on BBC Radio 1's Rock on Saturday show, Motorhead, Leaving Here and Limb from Limb were played. In September 1979 Chiswick released a 7\" vinyl picture disc in two pressings, black and white, and blue and white as well as single colour pressings in black, blue, pink, orange and white vinyl \u2013 catalogued Big Beat NSP13 and NS13 respectively. In 1981, a live recording, Motorhead was released as a single and reached number 6 in the UK Singles Chart. In 2008, the song was re-recorded as downloadable content for the rhythm game Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock, along with Stay Clean and (We Are) The Road Crew. It was covered by Primal Scream on their 1997 album Vanishing Point."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"Tik Tok\" (stylized as \"TiK ToK\") is the debut single by American recording artist Kesha. The song was produced by Dr. Luke and Benny Blanco and co-written by Kesha, Dr. Luke and Blanco. It was released on August 7, 2009 as the lead single from Kesha's debut studio album, Animal. The opening line of the song came from an experience where Kesha woke up surrounded by beautiful women, to which she imagined Diddy being in a similar scenario. The experience triggered the writing of the song which she later brought to her producer, Dr. Luke, who was then contacted by Diddy in hopes of a collaboration; he came to the studio the same day and recorded his lines and the song was completed. According to Kesha, the song's lyrics are representative of her and based on her life; the song has a carefree message and talks about not letting anything bring you down. The song is an electropop song with dance-pop elements that uses a minimalist video-game beat interspersed with handclaps and synths. The song's verses use a rap-sing vocal style while the chorus is sung; throughout the song the use of Auto-Tune is prominent. Musically, the song has been compared to the works of Lady Gaga, Uffie, and Fergie. The song generated mixed reviews from music critics upon its release. Critics generally praised the song's lyrics and their celebration of the party lifestyle; the song's production was generally well received although some critics criticized the song for being irritating and derivative. It achieved commercial success by topping the charts in eleven countries. In the United States, the song broke the record for the biggest single-week sum of all time for a female artist selling 610,000 digital downloads in one week. \"Tik Tok\" was certified 5\u00D7 platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) and has sold over six million copies in the United States. The song was the best-selling single worldwide in 2010, selling 12.8 million copies in that year alone, and by 2012, 14 million copies were sold, making it the third best-selling single in the digital history, after \"Call Me Maybe\" by Carly Rae Jepsen, and \"I Gotta Feeling\" by The Black Eyed Peas.

	dbo:abstract	"\"When Smokey Sings\" is a song by the new wave duo ABC. The lyrics and name of the song are a tribute to R&B and Soul singer Smokey Robinson. It was released in mid-1987, on ABC's album Alphabet City. Robinson himself was on the pop charts with his single \"One Heartbeat\" at the same time as this tribute song, marking one of the only times to date that a singer simultaneously was the performing artist of one Top 40 hit, while the subject of another chart hit. For the week ending 3 October 1987, both songs were in the Top 10 simultaneously. In 1964, The Carefrees hit #39 with \"We Love You Beatles\" during a time when The Beatles had several hits simultaneously in the Top 40. \"When Smokey Sings\" and its B-side, \"Chicago\" also topped the Hot Dance Club Play chart. The song reached number 11 on the UK chart and proved to be their second American Top 10 hit, peaking at number 5 on the Billboard Hot 100. There is a slight difference in the lyrics between the album and single version in the bridge of the song. In the album version, references are made to \"Luther\", \"Sly\", \"James\" and \"Marvin\" (most likely referring to Luther Vandross, Sly & the Family Stone, James Brown, and Marvin Gaye respectively). In the single version, this is replaced by alternate lyrics, followed by a short saxophone solo. Pitchfork Media were favourable for the Miami Mix, saying \"can you fuck with...the proto\u2013freestyle of the \"Miami mix\" of ABC's \"When Smokey Sings\"?...No, of course you cannot.\""@en ;

This song was written as an anthem for metalheads all over the world! We gathered footage and photos from our tribe, showing how free the spirit of metal really is. Respect!\" This song is thrashy with punk vocals during choruses, though it ends in a very Pink Floyd-like way, which Cavalera was conflicted about saying, \"I don't know why we did that. I still don't know if it was the right thing, but it came out like that. Marc [Rizzo] just did some really crazy guitars at the end of it that is just, like\u2026 It goes from total metal into crazy Pink Floyd, but it works. I mean, it's really wild.

Featuring Japanese record producer and Capsule member Yasutaka Nakata, the song was released as the lead single and double a-side single with \"Free Free\" from Dolce on August 22, 2007 through Avex Trax. Nakata had written, produced and arranged both tracks and is her first single to be handled by Nakata following later singles from her album Supreme Show (2008). Backed by synthesizers and keyboards, \"Free Free\" incorporates a new genre called \"Eropop\" with influences of electronic dance, house and disco music. The lyrical interpretation was based on the theme of erotica and freedom. Critical response to \"Super Music Maker\" was positive; some critics praised the songs composition and highlighted it as a career stand out track. Charting together with \"Free Free\", the physical single reached number thirty-two on the Japanese Oricon Singles Chart and stayed in there for four weeks. It sold over 10,000 units in Japan, her highest sales rank since 2006 and her last single to reach the limit.

It was released as a single in the UK on 27 August 1982 and peaked at number five in the UK Singles Chart. It was written by lead singer Martin Fry and released by Neutron Records. The B-side, \"Overture\", was an instrumental, orchestral medley of songs from The Lexicon of Love, arranged by Anne Dudley. In a retrospective review of the song, Allmusic journalist Mike DeGagne wrote: \"The lushness of the instruments and the small amounts of musical detail drape the body of the track, adding a slight classical feel to the song's flow.\" In 2005, Jess Harvell of Pitchfork Media listed \"All of My Heart\" as his favorite UK song of the post-punk \"New pop\" era, describing it as \"ABC's slickest and most gorgeous single, and yet also possibly their most bitter.\" Harvell wrote: \"Martin Fry alternates between open hearted and suspicious, warm and resentful with the turn of a phrase. The outro\u2013a swirl of soundtrack strings, plucked bass, and cascading piano\u2013is the most purely beautiful music of the era.\""@en ;

dbr:Fool_to_Cry	rdf:type	dbo:MusicalWork ;
	dbo:abstract	"\"Fool to Cry\" is a ballad by English rock band The Rolling Stones from their 1976 album Black and Blue. Recorded in December 1974, the song was written by Mick Jagger and Keith Richards. Mick Taylor had just left the band and the rest of the Stones were left without a lead guitarist. The recording of Black and Blue acted as a sort of audition for new guitarists, which led to session man Wayne Perkins playing guitar on this track.[citation needed] Jagger plays electric piano and Nicky Hopkins performs regular piano on the track, with Hopkins also playing the string synthesizer. Released as the lead single off Black and Blue on 20 April 1976, \"Fool to Cry\" reached No. 6 on the UK Singles Chart and No. 10 on the US Billboard Hot 100. \"Fool to Cry\" was the only track from Black and Blue to appear on the Stones' career-spanning greatest hits albums Forty Licks in 2002 and GRRR! in 2012."@en ;

It was written in 1964 by band member Jim McGuinn and his friend, Harvey Gerst, an acquaintance from McGuinn's days as a folk singer at The Troubadour folk club in West Hollywood, California. The song had originally appeared under the alternate title of \"Don't Be Long\" on the B-side of a single that The Byrds had released on Elektra Records in October 1964, under the pseudonym The Beefeaters. By the time that the song was re-recorded in September 1965, during the recording sessions for The Byrds' second Columbia Records' album, its title had been changed to \"It Won't Be Wrong\". Lyrically, the song is a relatively simplistic appeal for a lover to submit to the singer's romantic advances. Musically, however, the guitar riff following each verse foreshadows the raga experimentation of the band's later songs \"Eight Miles High\" and \"Why\", both of which would be recorded within three months of \"It Won't Be Wrong\". The Byrds' biographer, Johnny Rogan, has described the difference between the earlier Beefeaters' recording of the song and The Byrds' Columbia version as remarkable. Rogan went on to note \"The lackluster Beefeaters' version was replaced by the driving beat of a Byrds rock classic, complete with strident guitars and improved harmonies, that transformed the sentiments of the song from an ineffectual statement to a passionate plea.\" Both the band and their producer Terry Melcher also felt that the version included on the Turn! Turn! Turn! album was far more accomplished and exciting than the earlier recording of the song. After its appearance on the Turn! Turn! Turn! album, \"It Won't Be Wrong\" was selected as the B-side for The Byrds' \"Set You Free This Time\" single in January 1966. However, after initially poor sales of that single, Columbia Records in America began promoting the B-side instead, resulting in \"It Won't Be Wrong\" charting at #63 on the Billboard Hot 100. In the United Kingdom, \"Set You Free This Time\" was released as a single on February 11, 1966, but after the NME described the B-side as the best track on the single, it was re-released on February 18, 1966 with \"It Won't Be Wrong\" as the A-side. This re-issuing of essentially the same single (albeit with its A-side and B-side transposed) twice within the space of two weeks, caused confusion among Radio DJs over which of the two songs they should play and contributed to the single's failure to chart in the UK. The Byrds performed the song on the U.S. television programs Where The Action Is and Shivaree during 1966 but there's little evidence to suggest that the song was played regularly during the band's 1960s and 1970s live concerts. However, the song was performed by a reformed line-up of The Byrds featuring Roger McGuinn, David Crosby and Chris Hillman in January 1989. In addition to its appearance on The Byrds' second album, \"It Won't Be Wrong\" also appears on several Byrds' compilations, including The Original Singles: 1965\u20131967, Volume 1, The Very Best of The Byrds, The Byrds, The Essential Byrds, There Is a Season and the expanded and remastered edition of The Byrds' Greatest Hits. The original Elektra Records version of the song (titled \"Don't Be Long\") can be found on the albums In the Beginning, Byrd Parts and The Preflyte Sessions, as well as on the There Is a Season box set."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"Just Give Me a Reason\" is a song co-written and recorded by American singer and songwriter Pink featuring fun.'s lead singer Nate Ruess. The song was chosen as the third single from Pink's sixth studio album, The Truth About Love (2012). \"Just Give Me a Reason\" is a pop ballad written by both artists and produced by Jeff Bhasker. It starts off with a simple melody played on the piano, as Pink starts to sing the first verse and chorus, the latter of which introduces drum machines and bass. The second verse is then sung by Ruess, and the rest of the song is sung as a duet. The song ends with a piano solo, similar to the intro. It has a duration of four minutes and two seconds. Prior to its release, the song charted in many regions due to strong digital sales, which was the reason for its release. The song is about the desire to hold on to a relationship even when it appears to be breaking down. The song received critical acclaim, with many critics deeming the song as the best track within the album. The song attained worldwide success, topping the charts in twenty-one countries including the United States, Austria, Australia, Canada, Czech Republic, Iceland, Ireland, Lebanon, Italy, Luxembourg, Mexico, Netherlands, New Zealand, Poland, Portugal, Scotland, Slovakia, Sweden, as well as peaking within the top five in more than ten countries as United Kingdom, Belgium, Brazil, Denmark, Finland, France, Israel, Norway, Switzerland and Spain. In the US, it became Pink's fourth number-one single on the Billboard Hot 100. It also became her third number-one on the Billboard Digital Songs chart after \"So What\" (2008) and \"Fuckin' Perfect\" (2010). \"Just Give Me a Reason\" has sold more than 4 million digital downloads in the United States. \"Just Give Me a Reason\" has won the Billboard Mid-Year Award for Favorite Hot 100 No. Single. \"Just Give Me a Reason\" garnered two Grammy Award nominations for Best Pop Duo/Group Performance and Song of the Year at the 2014 Grammy Awards, where Pink and Nate Ruess performed the song after a trapeze-accompanied rendition of \"Try.\" The music video for \"Just Give Me a Reason\" featured Nate Ruess as well as Pink's husband, motocross racer Carey Hart, in a romantic setting which resembles an artificial marsh. The video won the MTV Video Music Award for Best Collaboration in 2013."@en ;

Bon Jovi opened many shows in 2010-2012 with This Is Our House. Designed as a \"sports anthem\", the song was used by a number of sports leagues and teams, including Australia's National Rugby League, who prominently used the song as part of its marketing campaign beginning in the 2011 season.

	dbo:abstract	"\"Yellow Flicker Beat\" is a song by New Zealand singer Lorde. Written by Lorde and Joel Little and produced by Little and Paul Epworth, the song was released on 29 September 2014 as the lead single from the soundtrack for The Hunger Games: Mockingjay \u2013 Part 1 by Republic Records. \"Yellow Flicker Beat\", which features an electronic production, is characterised as an art pop and electropop song. Its style was compared to that of Lorde's earlier releases such as her song \"Biting Down\" from The Love Club EP (2013) and her debut studio album, Pure Heroine (2013). The lyrics of the track refer to the rise of The Hunger Games' heroine Katniss Everdeen. The track was well-received by music critics, who praised its lyrical content for being more mature than that of Lorde's previous releases. Commercially, \"Yellow Flicker Beat\" peaked at number thirty-four on the US Billboard Hot 100 and entered the record charts of several nations, including Australia, Canada and New Zealand. A music video for the song was directed by Emily Kai Bock and was released on 7 November 2014. Four days later, the makeover of the song titled \"Flicker (Kanye West Rework)\" co-produced by Lorde and Kanye West was released. Lorde performed the song at the 2014 American Music Awards on 23 November 2014. The song was nominated for Best Original Song at the 72nd Golden Globe Awards, and Best Song at the 20th Critics' Choice Awards."@en ;

This mid-tempo song represents a joint collaboration between the Grammy Award-winning producer Babyface and Bryce Wilson, and was issued in the United States as a double A-side with \"Let It Flow\", the airplay hit from the motion picture Waiting to Exhale (1995). \"You're Makin' Me High\" became Braxton's first number-one single on both the Billboard Hot 100 and Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs charts; it remained on top for one week on the former and for two weeks on the latter, eventually going platinum as rated by the RIAA. A dance remix by David Morales allowed the single to also top the Hot Dance Club Play chart for two weeks in August 1996. Another remix for urban markets was created featuring rapper Foxy Brown, called the \"Groove Mix\". The song earned Braxton her third Grammy Award for Best Female R&B Vocal Performance in 1997. The success of \"You're Makin' Me High\" would later be continued with the release of \"Un-Break My Heart\" (1996). \"You're Makin' Me High\" was sampled for Method Man & Redman's 2001 song \"Part II\", from the How High soundtrack. In 2014, Anglo-American producer/DJ Secondcity sampled a part of the song's bridge for the main hook of his UK #1 single \"I Wanna Feel\". The song was originally written for R&B singer Brandy[citation needed] but was later used for Braxton's album, Secrets (1996)."@en ;

The song explains the grief that vocalist Gary Stringer felt following the death of his grandfather, and easing the pain of death. It established the band's popularity, appealing both to the then-current tendency for \"laddishness\" and to older rock fans. In the USA, it owed much of its success to young cable music channel M2, which played the video heavily and led to it becoming a \"Buzz Clip\" on the main MTV channel. In turn, the song provided a major boost for their second album Glow, which entered the UK album charts at number 1. The song and band were favourites on legendary UK music TV show TFI Friday, where they changed the lyrics to \"It's your letters\" to introduce that segment of the show."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"Bring the Noise\" is a song by the American hip hop group Public Enemy. It was included on the soundtrack of the 1987 film Less Than Zero and was also released as a single that year. It later became the first song on the group's 1988 album It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back. The single reached #56 on the Billboard Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart. The song's lyrics, most of which are delivered by Chuck D with interjections from Flavor Flav, include boasts of Public Enemy's prowess, an endorsement of Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan, retorts to unspecified critics, and arguments for rap as a legitimate musical genre on par with rock. The lyrics also have a remarkable metrical complexity, making extensive use of meters like dactylic hexameter. The title phrase appears in the chorus. The song includes several shout-outs to artists like Run-DMC, Eric B, LL Cool J and, unusually for a rap group, Yoko Ono and thrash metal band Anthrax, allegedly because Chuck D was flattered about Scott Ian wearing Public Enemy shirts while performing Anthrax gigs. Anthrax would later collaborate with Chuck D to cover the song. The song's production by The Bomb Squad, which exemplifies their characteristic style, features a dissonant mixture of funk samples, drum machine patterns, record scratching by DJ Terminator X, siren sound effects and other industrial noise. Critic Robert Christgau has described the song as \"postminimal rap refracted through Blood Ulmer and On the Corner, as gripping as it is abrasive, and the black militant dialogue-as-diatribe that goes with it is almost as scary as \"Stones in My Passway\" or \"Holiday in the Sun\". \"Bring the Noise\" was ranked #160 on Rolling Stone's list of the 500 greatest songs of all time."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"Goodbye Mr A\" is the second single by British pop rock band The Hoosiers from their debut album The Trick to Life. It was released on 8 October 2007. The song, which is written in the key of B major, was written in memory of frontman Irwin Sparkes' secondary school English teacher, Jonathan \"Mr. A\" Anderton. Sparkes said he was inspired to write the song upon hearing of Anderton's death in 2006. Many of the lyrics such as: \"So busy showing me where I'm wrong - you forgot to switch your feelings on...\", were reflective of Anderton's personality as a teacher, but Sparkes has described him as being a \"really cool guy\" in interviews with the media. Sparkes also says that Anderton requested his students call him \"Mr. A\", as he disliked being called \"Mr. Anderton\". It is from this that the song's title stems. The song has been noted for its similarities to Electric Light Orchestra's single \"Mr. Blue Sky\". The song is part of the soundtrack for the video game FIFA 08."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"Mr. Know It All\" is a song by American pop recording artist Kelly Clarkson. It was written by Brian Kennedy, Ester Dean, Brett James, and Dante Jones, with the production handled by Kennedy, Dean, and Jones. Clarkson described the song as a \"vocally raw record\" and stated that she and her producers strove to record her voice as it is heard at live performances, using as little auto-tune processing as possible. It was released by RCA Records as the lead single from her fifth studio album, Stronger on September 5, 2011. \"Mr. Know It All\" is a midtempo pop rock song with R&B influences, with its lyrical content dealing with the themes of heartbreak, and relationships with wisenheimers. Upon its release, \"Mr. Know It All\" has received mostly favorable reception from music critics, who noted the song as significantly different from Clarkson's previous releases. However, some critics compared this song to Alicia Keys' single \"Doesn't Mean Anything\" (2009) and Bruno Mars' single \"Just the Way You Are\" (2010). The song became a commercial success, it became her ninth top-ten hit on the Billboard Hot 100, and topped the Billboard Adult Pop Songs chart. Internationally, the song topped the charts in Australia and in South Korea, and has attained a top-ten position in New Zealand, Poland, the United Kingdom. It also became a crossover hit to the Billboard Hot Country Songs chart, becoming her first solo single to enter the country chart after 9 years since \"A Moment Like This\" (2002), prompting RCA to release a country version produced by Dann Huff in 2012. The song's accompanying music video was directed by Justin Francis and features a \"wall of doubt\" background in which derogatory headlines about Clarkson are posted. Several of the critics noted the video's informal fallacy approach to mainstream media. Clarkson has performed \"Mr. Know It All\" in various locations around the world, most notably at the 2011 NRL Grand Final, on the Australian, British and German versions of the television series The X Factor, and on the set-list of her Stronger Tour."@en ;

Shakira and Hill also served as the producers for the song. A Spanish-language translation of the song titled \"Loba\", which features additional lyrical contributions by Jorge Drexler, was also released earlier on 6 July. Musically, \"She Wolf\" is a disco, hi-NRG and synthpop-inspired track that details Shakira's boredom due to her uncaring partner, and how she looks for others to please her. Upon its release, \"She Wolf\" was met with favourable reception from music critics, many of whom praised it for being different from the other songs released at that time. Commercially, \"She Wolf\" performed well on record charts. It peaked in the top 10 of charts of countries like Canada, Germany, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom. In the United States, \"She Wolf\" peaked at numbers 11 and one on the US Billboard Hot 100 and Dance/Club Play Songs charts, respectively. The Spanish-language translation \"Loba\" peaked at number one on both the Hot Latin Songs and Tropical Songs component charts. \"She Wolf\" was certified double-platinum in Spain and platinum in Italy, Mexico, and the United States. An accompanying music video for the song was directed by Jake Nava, and features Shakira dancing in various locations, such as a red cave and a golden cage. Critical reception towards the video was also positive, many of whom praised Shakira's dancing ability. For additional promotion, Shakira performed the song on a number of shows and music festivals.

Despite being added to radio station playlists around Australia within weeks of its release the single peaked at #47 on the Australian Singles charts. Burford later attributed this to the fact that national youth broadcaster, Triple J, refused to play the song on-air. \"Our lead single, \"Fussy\" was even openly derided on air by Richard Kingsmill as \u2018just another pop release\u2019.

The conscious hip hop song was released as the first promotional single for the album. While the album itself garnered positive reviews (achieving a Metacritic score of 80, and an XL rating from XXL Magazine), \"HiiiPoWeR\" also drew significant acclaim for its lyricism and depth. HipHopDX gave it the Verse of the Year award and XXL Magazine called it \u201Cone of the finest tracks of the year\u201D. The song, produced by fellow American rapper J. Cole, contains samples from Pharoahe Monch\u2019s \"Simon Says\", Kanye West\u2019s \"So Appalled\", and Sixtoo\u2019s \"Duration Project Part 9\". Kendrick Lamar mentions that when he and J.

Upon its release, the song was well received in Mexico where it became one of the best-performing songs of the year. Since then, the song has been covered by several artists including Az\u00FAcar Moreno, Ricardo Montaner, and Alejandro Fern\u00E1ndez. Fern\u00E1ndez covered the song on his fifteenth studio album Confidencias (2013) and features American recording artist Christina Aguilera as the guest artist. It was served as the main theme song for the Mexican telenovela La Tempestad. His version peaked at number one on the Mexican Monitor Latino chart and became a top five hit in Spain and on the Billboard Hot Latin Songs chart in the United States. Az\u00FAcar Moreno's cover of the song peaked at number five in Spain while Montaner's version reached number one in Venezuela and ranked at number twenty-three on the US Latin Songs chart."@en ;

dbr:I_Want_a_Guy	rdf:type	dbo:MusicalWork ;
	dbo:abstract	"\"I Want a Guy\" is a song written by Freddie Gorman, Berry Gordy and Brian Holland and was the debuting single for Motown girl group The Supremes in 1961. It was also recorded by The Marvelettes. Featuring Diana Ross, going by her given name, Diane Ross, in lead, the song was a doo-wop ballad similar to what the Supremes had been recording since forming as \"The Primettes\" two years earlier. The songs lyrics tell about a lonely woman who wants a new lover who won't mistreat her and always be loyal to her. When issued, the song failed to chart forcing Berry Gordy to find other options for the teenage quartet - its full lineup included Barbara Martin alongside Ross, Florence Ballard and Mary Wilson. Three members of the group (Ross, Wilson and Ballard), in fact, had already recorded a single, \"Tears of Sorrow\"/\"Pretty Baby\", in their previous quartet, \"The Primettes\". In between the two singles the teenaged girls would replace Betty McGlown with Martin, and the new quartet would be recording under a new name (and under a new record deal). This song would be issued as a b-side of a Marvelettes hit (\"Twistin' Postman\") later that year and would be led by Wanda Rogers, one of her first with the group. Their version, more up-tempo then the original, also would not chart nationally, but became a regional hit. The Marvelettes version is a prototype for The Beatles' \"There's a Place\" on their 1963 album, Please Please Me."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"Just Let Me Know\" is a song recorded in late 1963 by The Temptations for the Gordy (Motown) label, written and produced by Motown president Berry Gordy, and is the B-side to the 1964 hit single \"The Way You Do the Things You Do\". Ironically, both songs competed with each other and with the H-D-H production, \"A Tear From A Woman's Eyes\", for the A-side; the latter song would be shelved for several years after losing the spot. It was recorded just mere days before the firing of original member Elbridge \"Al\" Bryant. In the song, the narrator tells his former love how much he misses her and that if she wants him back to tell him and he came to her \"as fast as he can.\" Two versions of this song was released, both of which was led by group's baritone singer (and front man) Paul Williams. The 1st pressing used a more soulful take with only Williams as lead; this version also appears on mono copies of their debut album, Meet the Temptations, as well as the box set \"The Complete Motown Singles Vol. 4: 1964.\" The 2nd pressing had a much smoother take, and featured Bryant with a few lead parts on the choruses (singing the line \"straight to you\" the first two times on the song \u2013 while the group sings it the remaining times). This version was also released on the stereo LP and compact disc editions of Meet the Temptations. Around the time the song was recorded Bryant had become restless, uncooperative and sometimes volatile. He'd miss concerts and recording sessions, had now preferred his day job as a milkman to performing, and been arguing and fighting with his fellow group members. By the time this single came out Bryant was fired and replaced by David Ruffin. Despite being a B-side, \"Just Let Me Know\" was given just as big a promotion as its A-side, the Eddie Kendricks-led \"The Way You Do the Things You Do\", which was a Top 20 Pop hit. Although the song did not chart nationally, it was a strong regional hit in many areas of the country. Due to the success of the A-side, Williams would be prevented from getting any more leads on the group's remaining A-sides (with the exception of group/multi-leads during the late 60's)."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"\"Lizzie and the Rainman\" is as song written by Kenny O'Dell and Larry Henley which was a #1 C&W hit for Tanya Tucker in 1975. A narrative song as was typical for the first phase of Tucker's career, \"Lizzie and the Rainman\" relates how a rainmaker visiting a drought-sticken Texas town woos a skeptical local woman named Lizzie Cooper . The idea for the song came from the film The Rainmaker whose heroine is named Lizzie Curry. Written in 1971, \"Lizzie and the Rainman\" had been recorded in 1972 by Bobby Goldsboro, Alex Harvey (composer of Tucker's breakout hit \"Delta Dawn\") and by the Hollies (as \"Lizzy and the Rainman\") as well as Kenny O'Dell himself, who had an unsuccessful single release of \"Lizzie and the Rainman\". Tanya Tucker recorded her vocal for \"Lizzie and the Rainman\" in a 19 March 1975 session in Los Angeles produced by Snuff Garrett; Tucker would recall: \"the recording was so impersonal. I was used to recording live with all the musicians in the studio, and I just sang to the tracks on this one.\" Released as the lead single from the album Tanya Tucker - which marked Tucker's MCA Records debut - \"Lizzie and the Rainman\" was Tucker's fourth C&W #1 and was also the first Tanya Tucker's single to reach the Pop Top 40 reaching #37 on the Billboard Hot 100 in June 1975. A #7 A/C hit, \"Lizzie and the Rainman\" would prove to be Tucker's only Pop hit despite her later recording material more specifically aimed at the Pop market; her one subsequent Hot 100 item \"Here's Some Love\" peaked at #82. \"Lizzie and the Rainman\" has also been recorded by Billie Jo Spears and - as \"Lizzy and the Rainman\" - by the Cox Family."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"Novacane\" is the debut single by American recording artist Frank Ocean. It was released as the lead single from his mixtape Nostalgia, Ultra. The song was written by Ocean, Tricky Stewart and Victor Alexander, and produced by Stewart. Lyrically, the song narrates a tale of a young female dental student who makes a living doing porn and who recreationally uses local anesthetic drugs that she acquires from her place of study. The song explores themes of isolation, loneliness and a lack of feeling caused by numbness. The song received highly positive reviews from music critics and was listed as one of the best songs of the year by publications such as The New York Times, Spin, Ology, Zimbio and Pitchfork Media. Reviews praised the dark subject matter of the song, and praised Ocean's ability to create narratives and the sonic atmosphere of the track. When Nostalgia, Ultra was expected to be released as an EP by Def Jam, \"Novacane\" was released as the first single, though the EP release was later cancelled. The song peaked at number 82 on the Billboard Hot 100 and entered the top 10 on the Heatseekers Songs chart. The song received a music video directed by Australian director Nabil Elderkin released on June 16. The highly stylized video shows a long take of Ocean sitting around in a darkly lit room. Ocean performed the song during a show in New York with alternative hip hop group OFWGKTA, and during his seven show tour through North America and Europe. It was also performed during his 14 show Channel Orange tour through North America."@en ;

Speaking in 2014 about the song Garvey said, \"We put the chords behind it and realised it was going to be the hook of all hooks. I was like, 'what do we think?'... It was, 'it's kind of similar to \"Hey Jude\", isn't it?' I was like, 'yeah, and it's also similar to \"Loaded\" by Primal Scream, and we like both those songs, don't we?'

To promote the single, the band performed the song on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon. The song has been performed in every show during the Innocence + Experience Tour. It was also performed specially as a part of \"Red Nose Day\".[citation needed] Lead vocalist Bono has described it as a love song dedicated to his wife, Ali. He told Rolling Stone, \"Before I even knew what commitment was, I ended up as a young man in the arms of this young woman, in a world somewhat hostile to the concept of the childhood sweetheart and a first love.\" The music video for the song is a short film featuring Woody Harrelson and his daughter Zoe. A second video was released August 27th, 2015 and premiered exclusively on Facebook for 24 hours. The clip quickly amassed close to a million views. The video was directed by Matt Mahurin, who had worked with the band on previous videos such as \"Love is Blindness\" and \"With Or Without You.\" As part of a cross-promotion with Apple, fans at select European concerts during the Innocence + Experience tour can enter the \"Experience Bus\", a vehicle offering virtual reality headsets playing an alternate video for the song. It features a performance of the song by the band from the tour's \"e-stage\", intercut with footage of fans singing along.

It is a style parody of The Doors, and contains lyrics inspired by postings at the online classified advertising service, Craigslist. Yankovic described the idea of the song coming about thinking how it would be \"anachronistically weird\" for Jim Morrison to scream about Craigslist. Yankovic opted to use Craigslist as an example of something big in both the popular culture and his own life, and spent time exploring its listings to compose the lyrics. The song was released shortly after the closure of the Michael John Anderson (Craigslist Killer) case, a factor Yankovic considered \"unfortunate timing\". Former Doors keyboardist Ray Manzarek was enlisted to recreate the music style for the song. The single was the first of four new singles that were being released as part of the Internet Leaks EP.

Inflatable could not be included on future compilations such as The Best Of: 1994\u20131999 due to lack of licensing rights. The song's chorus has a lyric inspired by a line from the Pixies song \"Bone Machine\". Bone Machine features the line 'You're so pretty when you're faithful to me', while Gavin Rossdale sings 'So pretty when you're faithful'. It was mutual appreciation of the Pixies that drew founding members Gavin Rossdale and Nigel Pulsford together. The song bears some resemblance to previous Bush hits \"Glycerine\" and \"Letting the Cables Sleep\" in that it is more subdued than the band's other singles. However, it is the only Bush song to feature an acoustic guitar. The song is the last single featuring the four original members of the band and it would be the last single to be released under the Bush name for almost 9 years until 2010 when \"Afterlife\" was released.
