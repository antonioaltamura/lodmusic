	dbo:abstract	"\"Telephone\" is a song recorded by Lady Gaga which features American R&B singer Beyonc\u00E9 for Gaga's third EP, The Fame Monster (2009). The song was written by Gaga, Rodney Jerkins, LaShawn Daniels, Lazonate Franklin and Beyonc\u00E9. Inspired by her fear of suffocation, Gaga explained that the lyrics preferring relaxing on the dance floor to answering her lover's phone call are a metaphor, the phone calling her representing the fear of not having worked hard enough to succeed. Originally, Gaga wrote the song for Britney Spears, who recorded a demo. Musically, \"Telephone\" consists of an expanded bridge, verse-rap and a sampled voice of an operator announcing that the phone line is unreachable. Beyonc\u00E9 appears in the middle of the song, singing the verses in a rapid-fire way, accompanied by double beats. The song received positive reviews from critics who frequently noted \"Telephone\" as a stand-out track from The Fame Monster. It was Grammy-nominated for Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals in 2011. \"Telephone\" charted in a number of countries due to digital sales following the album's release, namely in the United States, Australia, Canada, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Sweden and Hungary. The song was particularly successful in Europe where it reached the top of the charts in Belgium, Denmark, Hungary, Ireland, Netherlands, Norway and the United Kingdom. According to the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry, the single sold 7.4 million digital copies worldwide in 2010, making it one of Gaga's best-selling singles. The accompanying music video is a continuation of the video for her 2009 song, \"Paparazzi\", and is also shot as a short film. After Gaga gets bailed out of prison by Beyonc\u00E9, they go to a diner and poison the guests having breakfast. After the homicide they escape and end up in a high speed police chase. The video referenced Quentin Tarantino and his films Pulp Fiction (1994) and Kill Bill: Volume 1 (2003). The video received generally positive reviews was nominated for three awards at the 2010 MTV Video Music Awards, including one for Video of the Year. In January 2015 Billboard named the video, best video of the decade. In memory of Alexander McQueen, Gaga performed an acoustic rendition of \"Telephone\" mixed with \"Dance in the Dark\" at the 2010 BRIT Awards. It was also added to the set list of The Monster Ball Tour in 2010, the Born This Way Ball in 2012 and ArtRave: The Artpop Ball in 2014."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"There Goes My Baby\" is a song written by Ben E. King (Benjamin Nelson), Lover Patterson, George Treadwell, Jerry Leiber, and Mike Stoller, and produced by Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller for The Drifters. This was the first single by the second incarnation of the Drifters (previously known as the 5 Crowns), who assumed the group name in 1958 after manager George Treadwell fired the remaining members of the original lineup. Leiber and Stoller used a radically different approach to production than Ahmet Ertegun and Jerry Wexler had employed with the original Clyde McPhatter-led Drifters. The combination of new style and new group fit, and the song reached number two on the Billboard Hot 100 and number one on the Billboard R&B chart and on the Cash Box sales chart for two weeks, in the summer of 1959. The Atlantic Records release was King's debut recording as lead singer of the group. The song was included in the musical revue \"Smokey Joe's Cafe\"."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"There Goes My Baby\" is a song by American recording artist Usher. It was written by James Scheffer, Frank Romano, Danny Morris and Rico Love, with the latter producing the song with Jim Jonsin. The song was first released as the second promo single for his sixth studio album, Raymond v. Raymond (2010) on February 9, 2010, and later released to rhythmic and urban airplay as the album's fourth U.S. single from the album on June 15, 2010. It was later included the album's follow-up set, Versus. \"There Goes My Baby\" is a down-tempo R&B piece, which makes use of Usher's falsetto range. Critics received the song positively, complimenting Usher's falsetto. While reaching a peak of twenty-five on the Billboard Hot 100, it topped the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart. The charting gave Usher his eleventh number-one on the chart, tying Ray Charles and R. Kelly for the fifth-most number-one's since the chart's inception. The song's accompanying music video features Usher pursuing his love interest in risque scenes. Critics generally favored the video, calling it classic Usher, while some noted its theme was played-out. Usher performed the song a number of times, including at the 2010 BET Awards. The song earned Usher a Grammy Award for Best Male R&B Vocal Performance, at the 53rd Grammy Awards in 2011."@en ;

It was written and produced by Jackson, Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis, with additional writing by Jackson's then-husband, Ren\u00E9 Elizondo, Jr. It was released as the second single from the album on December 2, 1997, through Virgin Records. Originally written as a ballad, the track was rearranged as a dance and house song. Jackson was inspired to write the song by her own personal experience of losing a friend to AIDS, as well as by a piece of fan mail she received from a young boy in England who had lost his father. \"Together Again\" was well received by music critics, who praised the song's structure and Jackson's vocals, comparing them to those of Diana Ross and works by Donna Summer. Commercially, the song was a success, topping the Billboard Hot 100 chart for two weeks, as well as reaching the top of the Hot Dance Club Songs. The song was additionally certified Gold by the RIAA. Worldwide, it peaked within the top five in most countries, such as Canada and the United Kingdom, and topped the charts in the Netherlands. As of 2015 it has sold 6 million copies worldwide. Two music videos were produced for \"Together Again\". The video for the original, directed by Seb Janiak, shows Jackson and her dancers performing in a futuristic African paradise where people are seen living side by side with wild animals such as elephants, giraffes, and wildcats. Another music video released for the 'Deeper Remix' was directed by Ren\u00E9 Elizondo, Jr. and shows Jackson in an apartment. Jackson performed \"Together Again\" in a number of occasions to promote The Velvet Rope, including at the American Music Awards, and also on all of her tours since its release. It is also included in two of Jackson's greatest hits collections, Number Ones (2009) and Icon: Number Ones (2010)."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"Un Poco de Amor\" (English: \"A Little Bit of Love\") is a song by Colombian singer-songwriter Shakira, taken from her debut studio album Pies Descalzos. It was released on May 16, 1996, by Sony Music and Columbia Records as the fourth single from the album. The song was written and produced by Shakira and Luis Fernando Ochoa. \"Un Poco de Amor\" is a Latin pop song that incorporates reggae elements. Lyrically, it states that Shakira is waiting to find someone who loves her. Upon its release, \"Un Poco de Amor\" received generally favorable reviews from music critics, who recognized it as a stand-out track from Pies Descalzos.

The song was the third, and final single from the band's second album Lullaby, and was released on July 15, 1989. \"Witchcraft\" was the only single from the album Lullaby that failed to make the Billboard charts. The track samples the classic 60's TV series Bewitched, and also chants the names of the witches/characters from the show...\"Enchantra, Endora, Tabitha, Esmerelda, Clara, Hagatha\". The song features quirky deadpan rap-style vocals from Susan Ottaviano, Jade Lee, and Lauren Roselli, with a Shakespeare-inspired incanting of ingredients for brewing a love potion. The B-side \"Enchantra\" is a completely different composition, aside from the fact that it uses the chant of Bewitched character names from \"Witchcraft\". The cover art of the 12\" was done by band members Lauren Roselli and Jade Lee. It consists of a picture of a Play-Doh \"queen\" (done by Lauren Roselli), with refrigerator magnet lettering of the band's name and song title. Female names included as part of the back cover artwork (Enchantra, Hagatha, Clara, Endora, and Esmeralda) come from the song's chorus. The witches named in the song's chorus are all named as a part of the back cover art except Tabitha. The cover sleeve was featured in the 2011 book Put The Needle On The Record by Matthew Chojnacki, which celebrated the vinyl sleeves of records from the 1980s. During the band's Lullaby Tour in 1989, when performing \"Witchcraft\", the band donned witches' hats, making it a fan favorite of the band's live shows. \"Enchantra\" has been used as the intro track while the band takes to the stage during Book of Love's 2013 shows."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"Won't Get Fooled Again\" is a song by the English rock band The Who, written by Pete Townshend. It was released as a single in June 1971, reaching the top 10 in the UK, while the full eight-and-a-half-minute version appears as the final track on the band's 1971 album Who's Next, released that August. Townshend wrote the song as a closing number of the Lifehouse project, and the lyrics criticise revolution and power. To symbolise the spiritual connection he had found in music via the works of Meher Baba and Inayat Khan, he programmed a mixture of human traits into a synthesizer and used it as the main backing instrument throughout the song. The Who tried recording the song in New York in March 1971, but re-recorded a superior take at Stargroves the next month using the synthesizer from Townshend's original demo. Ultimately, Lifehouse as a project was abandoned in favour of Who's Next, a straightforward album, where it also became the closing track. The song has been performed as a staple of the band's setlist since 1971, often as the set closer, and was the last track drummer Keith Moon played live with the band. As well as a hit, the song has achieved critical praise, appearing as one of Rolling Stone's The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time. It has been covered by several artists, such as Van Halen who took their version to No. 1 on the Billboard Album Rock Tracks chart. It has been used for several TV shows and films, and in some political campaigns."@en ;

Aida knows that this would ruin her father's escape and tells him he must go through with it. Radames agrees, on condition that she escapes to freedom on a boat he will provide. The two lovers lament the complication of the circumstances of their love together before parting. For John, \"Written In The Stars\" was his 57th -- and to date, final -- top 40 single on the US Billboard charts as a performer. John posted at least one top 40 single on the US charts every year from 1970 to 1999, with this song being the last in the run. Due to Rimes' previous country music success, made #74 on Canada's RPM country chart due to unsolicited airplay as an album cut.

	dbo:abstract	"\"Yo-Yo\" is a song by British recording artist Nicola Roberts, released as the third and final single from Roberts' debut solo album Cinderella's Eyes on 6 January 2012. Originally, \"Yo-Yo\" was set to be Roberts' debut single, but \"Beat of My Drum\" was selected in its place. \"Beat of My Drum\" and \"Lucky Day\", Roberts' previous singles, garnered positive comments from critics, but failed to impact commercially. \"Yo-Yo\" was written by Roberts, Maya Von Doll and Dimitri Tikovoi while it was produced by latter, and was the first song to be composed by the group. Roberts also claimed the track had defined her musical style. \"Yo-Yo\" is a 1950s-themed electropop and synthpop song in which Roberts sings about an undecided lover. The song received positive reviews from critics, who compared Roberts' vocals to those of singer Kate Bush. Commercially, it was a failure, charting at number 111 on the UK Singles Chart. A music video was released on 30 November 2011; the video sees Roberts repeatedly changing outfit for a party in which she finds her love interest cheating on her, ending with an aggressive confrontation. It garnered positive critical responses although the low-budget drew criticism. Roberts performed \"Yo-Yo\" at London's G-A-Y nightclub and on the Alan Titchmarsh Show, among other occasions."@en ;

The song was first released via digital download on January 28, 2005. It was then solicited to mainstream radio on March 15, 2005. An extended wedding version of the song was then released on July 26, 2005. Musically, \"You and Me\" is a melodic pop rock song which, by today's standards, has a notably high emphasis on acoustics. It also contains influences of adult alternative. The song received positive reviews from critics, who noted that the song was more mellow and stripped-down than their previous singles. It became a commercial success, charting in the top five in the United States and also charting in Australia and New Zealand. On May 19, 2005, the song was certified Gold by the RIAA for selling more than 500,000 units in the United States. In 2005, it became the ninth most downloaded song, according to Nielsen SoundScan. Because of its success, it appeared as the number one song on Billboard's list of Top 40 Adult Pop Songs from 1996-2011 on March 16, 2011.

The song was written by Minaj, Joseph Hughes, David Freedman, and Andrew \"Pop\" Wansel, and was produced by the latter. Minaj originally intended to release \"Massive Attack\" as the lead single from Pink Friday, though its release was scrapped after an underwhelming commercial performance. Described as a \"rap ballad\", the song is a change of tempo compared to Minaj's previous work, and according to Mariel Concepcion of Billboard, the song contains a \"new brand of hood majesty.\" The song heavily samples Annie Lennox's 1995 cover version of the song \"No More I Love You's\" (1986) by The Lover Speaks, using its background vocals with additional bass, hip-hop backbeats and drum loops added. The song received mostly positive reviews from critics, complimenting Minaj's singing and rapping flexibility, and the use of the Lennox sample.

	dbo:abstract	"\"Your Wildest Dreams\" is a 1986 single by the progressive rock band the Moody Blues, written by the band's lead singer, principal songwriter and lead guitarist Justin Hayward. The song was first released as a single, and later released on the Moody Blues 1986 album The Other Side of Life. It was a top-10 hit in the United States, peaking at #9, which had not happened to a Moody Blues song since \"Nights in White Satin\" in 1972. The song also became an Adult Contemporary number-one hit, and also charted at number two on the Mainstream Rock chart. The Moody Blues' previous album, The Present, was relatively unsuccessful, although it did contain a couple of moderately successful singles. This caused the Moody Blues to lose some of their popularity among younger audiences. The success of \"Your Wildest Dreams\" reintroduced the Moody Blues to this younger audience, and their popularity was boosted even higher than before as a result. With the band moving towards a more electronic sound, the Moody Blues relied less upon band member Ray Thomas' flute talents. As a result, \"Your Wildest Dreams\" was one of the band's first singles recorded without a flute, although Thomas would continue playing the instrument on their earlier songs at Moody Blues' concerts and providing additional back-up vocals. The lyrics of \"Your Wildest Dreams\" tell the story of a man who is remembering his first love, and wonders if she remembers him the way he remembers her. \"Your Wildest Dreams\" was followed up by a sequel in 1988. The sequel is titled \"I Know You're Out There Somewhere\", and it appears on the Moody Blues album Sur la Mer. A music video was also produced for \"Your Wildest Dreams\", which received a Billboard Video of the Year award. The video was frequently featured on MTV. The actress in the video is Janet Spencer-Turner. In flashback scenes, the young Moody Blues are represented in the video by the British band Mood Six. The video was recognized as the \"best overall video\" at the Billboard Video Music Conference held in Los Angeles in November 1986. Brian Grant was awarded the top director honor."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"Already Gone\" is a song performed by American pop singer-songwriter Kelly Clarkson from her fourth studio album, All I Ever Wanted. It is co-written by Clarkson and Ryan Tedder, who also produced it. The song was released as the album's third single in August 2009. Lyrically, \"Already Gone\" is about the breakup of a relationship; the music consists of an arrangement using a piano, drums, and string instruments. The production and release of \"Already Gone\" have been surrounded in controversy. Clarkson claimed that Tedder re-used the musical arrangement on the 2008 Beyonc\u00E9 Knowles song \"Halo\", and stated that the public would incorrectly assume that she had stolen it; Tedder declared the accusations hurtful and false. After failing to prevent the song from being included on All I Ever Wanted because the track listing had already been finalized and the album was already being pressed, Clarkson then voiced her anger towards her record company bosses for subsequently deciding to release it as a single. The accompanying music video was directed by Joseph Kahn, who complained that he was not allowed to fully realize his vision, and stated he was unhappy with the final result. It features scenes of Clarkson dressed in a gold gown and expensive jewelry while lying on a chaise longue in an apartment. Shots of floating objects intersperse a second scene in which Clarkson, wearing a black dress, sings in a rehearsal room while surrounded by the instruments of an invisible orchestra. Despite her dissatisfaction with the song's release as a single, Clarkson began promoting it in July 2009, performing it live on the Late Show with David Letterman and other talk shows. In the fall, she performed the song on VH1 Divas and at the American Music Awards. She included \"Already Gone\" in the encore set of her 2009 All I Ever Wanted Tour. Clarkson has also performed the song in tours after. The song has received much praise from music critics, and is regarded as one of the highlights of All I Ever Wanted. Critics have praised the song for its expressions of vulnerability, its emotional impact, and its successful use of the ballad form. It peaked at number 13 on the Billboard Hot 100, and was certified Platinum in Canada and Gold in Australia."@en ;

The song serves as the opening theme of the 2010-2011 Kamen Rider Series Kamen Rider OOO. The single for the song was released on November 17, 2010, as a standard CD release and a CD+DVD release featuring the music video for the song. On September 15, 2010, Avex released the opening sequence edit of the song to digital music outlets. The single includes 3 variations of the song: the single cut, a ska edit, and the instrumental track. Japan-based rapper Rah-D is featured on the track. \"Anything Goes!\" is Maki Ohguro's first single in 11 years to break the top 10 of the Oricon at number 7, after selling 33,000 copies in its first week of release. A balladic version of the song titled \"Anything Goes! \u201CBallad\u201D\" was played during the final scenes of the finale of Kamen Rider OOO. Ohguro stated that she thought that the song would also work as a slow ballad, especially after she has been watching how the series has progressed, and recorded the song during her hiatus from releases. She also expressed how she think her children would react when they grow up and watch the future Kamen Rider shows, believing they will think she was cool for having recorded the Kamen Rider OOO theme song. The balladic version was initially to be released as a single on October 19, 2011, but was eventually pushed back to December 7 of that year."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"Anything Goes\" is a song written by Cole Porter for his musical Anything Goes (1934). Many of the lyrics feature humorous (but dated) references to various figures of scandal and gossip in Depression-era high society. For example, one couplet refers to Sam Goldwyn's notorious box-office failure Nana, which featured a star, Anna Sten, whose English was said to be incomprehensible to all except Goldwyn, who came from the same part of Europe (though, in fact, Goldwyn was from Poland and Sten Ukraine). Other 1930s society references include film producer Max Gordon, socialite Evalyn Walsh McLean and her highly promoted trip to the Russian SFSR, interior design pioneer Lady Mendl's scandalous predilection for performing hand stands and cartwheels in public at the age of 70, and the financial woes common to \"old money\" families during the Depression, such as the Vanderbilts, Rockefellers and Whitneys. Most modern versions omit these lyrics, replacing them instead with generic examples of social upheaval."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"Chocolate\" is a song by Australian recording artist Kylie Minogue, taken from her ninth studio album Body Language (2003). It was written by its producer Johnny Douglas and Karen Poole. The song is a ballad which uses a chocolate simile to describe Minogue's obsession with love. It contains elements of disco and funk and employs breathy and whispery vocals. It was released as the third and final single from the album on 28 June 2004 by Parlophone. Critical reception towards \"Chocolate\" varied from favourable to mixed; some critics favoured its commercial appeal and Minogue's vocals, while some criticised it for being dated. In Australia, the song failed to reach the top ten and peaked at number 14. It found more success in the United Kingdom, where it became her 27th top-ten hit after it debuted at number six on the UK Singles Chart. The single also charted inside the top twenty in Hungary and Italy. A music video for \"Chocolate\" was directed by Dawn Shadforth and was envisioned as a tribute to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer musicals. It chiefly features Minogue and numerous backup dancers, in a hall, performing a dance routine choreographed by Michael Rooney. The song was performed live by Minogue at the one-off concert show Money Can't Buy and TV show Top of the Pops. \"Chocolate\" was included on the set list of the singer's Showgirl: The Greatest Hits and Showgirl: The Homecoming tours."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"Chocolate\" is a song from The Time's 1990 album Pandemonium. The song was originally recorded in mid-April, 1983 by Prince at Sunset Sound studios during sessions for Ice Cream Castle. Prince originally performed all instruments and vocals (backing vocals by Wendy & Lisa) and this recording remains unreleased, but circulates among collectors. The song was reworked in late 1989 for inclusion on Pandemonium and contains input by the band. Part of Prince's original vocals were edited and included to be a humorous account between Morris Day and a feisty waiter. \"Chocolate\" is a pop-funk offering driven by a drum machine pattern and infectious bassline. The drum pattern is very similar to Prince's \"Lady Cab Driver\" from 1999, and several lines from the Prince outtake \"Cloreen Baconskin\" (from Crystal Ball) were re-used throughout the song. Added to the mix are the familiar keyboard replacements for horns and funky rhythm guitar, with a bluesy solo toward the end of the song. The title refers to sex; \"gimme some of your chocolate\" is a euphemism for African-American vagina. The song is a humorous number, with Day recounting a woman allowing him to spend money on her without giving up the \"chocolate\". The song was released as the second single from Pandemonium with \"My Drawers\" from Ice Cream Castle as a B-side. A maxi-single was also released with several remixes of the song. The song only achieved moderate success, reaching #44 on the R&B charts."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"Come Home\" is a song written by OneRepublic frontman Ryan Tedder for the band's debut album, Dreaming Out Loud (2007). The piano-based ballad features orchestral flourishes, and lyrically revolves around the eponymous pleading hook \"Come home, come home\". Some reviewers felt the song had political undertones as an appeal to recall American troops as Tedder had written the song about a friend serving overseas. \"Come Home\" was highlighted as a refreshing change of pace from the many similar-sounding songs composing Dreaming Out Loud. In 2009, the song was remastered featuring singer-songwriter Sara Bareilles, and this version was issued digitally as the album's fifth and final single. The song debuted at #80 on the Billboard Hot 100 the week of July 14 before dropping off the chart the following week due to a lack of promotion. The song was never serviced to radio, and failed to chart outside the U.S. \"Come Home\" was featured on episodes of Gossip Girl, Cold Case and The Vampire Diaries."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"Coming Home\" is a song by American rapper and producer Diddy and his band Dirty Money, from their debut album Last Train to Paris (2010). It was released on November 21, 2010, as the album's fourth single. The contemporary hip-hop pop song was written by Jermaine Cole, Diddy, Jay-Z, Alex da Kid and Skylar Grey. Kid and Jay-Z produced the song while Grey featured vocals on the song's chorus. Jay-Z and Kid gifted the song to Diddy for Last Train to Paris. Autobiographically written, \"Coming Home\" is inspired by moments in Diddy's life, the loss of his close friend, The Notorious B.I.G and references to classic songs by Dionne Warwick, McFadden & Whitehead and Smokey Robinson & the Miracles. Critics praised the redemptive ballad for the personal themes and lyrics which were a snapshot of Diddy's life. Praise was also given for Grey's soft vocals which complemented the warmth of the song. An accompanying music video, directed by Rich Lee, follows the trio wandering through the desert in search of home only to find burned belongings and the shell of a home. Singled out as one of the album's highlights, \"Coming Home\" was promoted with live TV performances including at the American Music Awards on November 21, 2010, the WWE Tribute to the Troops concert, and the March 10, 2011 episode of American Idol which marked the first live performance of the song featuring Skylar Grey. To date, \"Coming Home\" is Diddy-Dirty Money's most successful single and the highest charting single from Last Train to Paris. Aside from amassing one million digital sales, it peaked at number eleven on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 and number nine in Canada. Internationally, the single topped both Belgium Ultratip charts and the Swiss Singles Chart, as well as reaching top five in the UK. This comes in addition to breaking onto the A-playlists on British urban music radio and mainstream radio, and topping the UK R&B Singles chart for three consecutive weeks."@en ;

Harrison wrote the song in 1970, midway through the recording sessions for All Things Must Pass, and recorded it in Los Angeles the following year while organising the Concert for Bangladesh. The composition was inspired by the deteriorating condition of his mother, Louise, before she succumbed to cancer in July 1970, and by Harrison's feelings of helplessness as he visited her in hospital in the north of England. Given the subject matter of his lyrics, \"Deep Blue\" also served to convey the suffering endured by the millions of refugees from war-torn Bangladesh in 1971, as sickness and disease became widespread among their makeshift camps in northern India. Following Harrison's work with American guitarist David Bromberg, \"Deep Blue\" features sparse instrumentation in the folk-blues style. It includes one of Harrison's first uses of dobro on a recording. The song proved popular on US radio and was listed with the A-side when \"Bangla Desh\" peaked at number 23 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. Well regarded by music critics and commentators, \"Deep Blue\" was unavailable officially for 35 years after this non-album single, during which it gained a reputation as an overlooked B-side. The re-release came in September 2006, when EMI included the song as a bonus track on the reissue of Harrison's Living in the Material World album."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"Express Yourself\" is a song by American singer-songwriter Madonna, from her fourth studio album Like a Prayer (1989). It was released as the second single from the album on May 9, 1989 by Sire Records. The song was included on the greatest hits compilation albums The Immaculate Collection (1990), and Celebration (2009). \"Express Yourself\" was the first song that Madonna and producer Stephen Bray collaborated on for Like a Prayer. Written and produced by them, the song was a tribute to American funk and soul band Sly and the Family Stone. The main inspiration behind the song is female empowerment, urging women never to go for second-best and to always express their inner feelings. \"Express Yourself\" is an upbeat dance-pop song that features instrumentation from brass, hand claps and drum beats, while the chorus is backed by the sound of saxophone and percussion. The lyrics talk about rejecting material pleasures and only accepting the best for oneself; subtexts are employed throughout the song. \"Express Yourself\" received positive reviews from critics, who applauded the gender equality message of the song and complimented the song for being a hymn to freedom and encouragement to women and all oppressed minorities. Commercially, the song peaked at number two on the Billboard Hot 100 and became Madonna's sixth number-one hit on the European Hot 100 Singles chart. It also reached the top of the singles charts in Canada, Italy and Switzerland, and the top five elsewhere. The accompanying music video, directed by David Fincher, was inspired by the Fritz Lang classic film Metropolis (1927). It had a total budget of $5 million ($9.54 million in 2016 dollars), which made it the most expensive music video made up to then, and currently the third most expensive of all time. The video portrayed a city full of tall skyscrapers and railway lines. Madonna played the part of a glamorous lady and chained masochist, with muscular men acting as her workers. In the end, she picks one of them\u2014played by model Cameron Alborzian\u2014as her date. Critics noted the video for its exploitation of female sexuality and came to the conclusion that Madonna's masculine image in the video was gender-bending. \"Express Yourself\" has been performed on four of Madonna's world tours, and has been covered by the female leads of the Fox TV show Glee, who performed the song in the episode titled \"The Power of Madonna\". The song and the video are noted for their freedom expression and feminist aspects, and its postmodern nature entranced academics, by resisting definition. It has also left its mark on the work of contemporary music artists, including the Spice Girls, Christina Aguilera and Lady Gaga."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"Good for You\" is a song by American singer Selena Gomez, recorded for her second studio album Revival (2015). It features vocals by American rapper ASAP Rocky, and was written by both alongside Julia Michaels, Justin Tranter, Nick Monson, and Nolan Lambroza, being produced by the latter two \u2014 with Dreamlab serving as Gomez's vocal producer. Originally, the track was conceived by Michaels, Tranter and Monson in 45 minutes, during a session booked by the latter. Then, the singer received the song through the trio's A&R and was entirely involved in its creative session, helping to develop it as a representation of her process of self-realization, her confidence as a young woman, and her feelings of vulnerability. After it was reworked by Lambroza, she sent the song to Rocky, who added new instruments and co-produced it with his frequent collaborator Hector Delgado, who was in charge of Rocky's vocal production. Additional songwriting was provided by Gomez. After anticipation by Gomez, \"Good for You\" was digitally released on June 22, 2015, through record labels Interscope and Polydor, serving as the album's lead single and as the first song by the singer to be released through those labels. A torch song, it is a pop and R&B slow jam with electro and hip hop elements that comprises a mellow, low-key snap-drop hip hop beat reminiscent of modern, pitched-down Southern hip hop productions, minor sound bursts, percussion instrumentation, drum machines, airy and transparent synthesizer, and a minimalistic bass. The artist sings atypically with breathy vocals and a plaintive timbre in the track, which was noted for being her first collaboration with a rapper. Its come-hither lyrics have intensity, psychodrama, self-confidence, and female empowerment as main themes, dealing with pleasing her lover and being the perfect complement for him. Rocky raps his verse at the end of the song, which is written from a male, player perspective and features braggadocio, profanity, and sexual innuendos. \"Good for You\" was well received by music critics, who praised its minimalistic production, its sexual appeal, and Gomez's breathy vocals, as well her maturity and artistic growth; some of them, however, had mixed reactions towards Rocky's contribution. Reviewers also compared her voice to that of Lana Del Rey, Imogen Heap and Lorde, while noted similarities to the works of Del Rey. It was included in many year-end lists of best songs and was nominated to 2015 Teen Choice and MTV Video Music Awards. Commercially, the song also had a positive reception, reaching the top twenty of countries as Australia, Austria, Canada, Denmark, France, New Zealand, and Spain, as well as the Czech Republic and Slovakia's digital charts. In the United States, it debuted at number nine of Billboard Hot 100 and later reached a peak at fifth position, becoming her highest-peaking single so far, as well reaching Pop Songs' summit \u2014 where it became her first song to do so. Its accompanying music video was directed by Sophie Muller and premiered on Times Square screens on June 26, 2015. The project uses a new and slower version of the song, which omits Rocky's verse and features string instrumentation. Highlighted for its provocative imagery, it follows a low-key premise with Gomez wallowing on several vignettes wearing a number of casual outfits. A second version was later released using the explicit edition of the track and features Rocky rapping his verse with Gomez's scenes and dynamic visuals in the background; new shots also are present in this version. Both videos received positive comments by critics, who praised the singer's sensuality and the growth in her artistic imagery, describing the first as her \"most intimate\" to date and comparing it to Del Rey's works. To promote \"Good for You\", Gomez made interviews for radios and a few live performances in shows as Today and Taylor Swift's The 1989 World Tour (2015), where she made its first live performance and served as a special guest."@en ;

Before Smith had completed the lyrics, an instrumental version of the song was used as the theme for the French television show Les Enfants du Rock. \"Just Like Heaven\" was the third single released from their 1987 album Kiss Me, Kiss Me, Kiss Me, while Smith's memories of the trip formed the basis for the song's accompanying music video. The song became the Cure's first American hit and reached number 40 on the Billboard charts in 1988. It has been praised by critics and covered by artists such as Dinosaur Jr., Alvin and the Chipmunks, and Katie Melua. Smith has said he considers \"Just Like Heaven\" to be one of the band's strongest songs."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"Let's Go to Bed\" is a song performed by German pop group No Angels. It was written by Mousse T. and frequent collaborator Errol Rennalls for the band's second studio album Now... Us! (2002), while production was handled by the former. Musically, the track is a mid-paced pop song that is set in retro style. It contains heavy elements of psychedelic soul and funk music, with its instrumentation led by a bass guitar. \"Let's Go to Bed\" contains lyrics that reference to a celebration of sexual lust and conquest, leading up to a desire to invite a love interest to come to bed. The song was well received by contemporary music critics, who noted it the album's standout track and felt it was a breakaway from the Europop genre widely associated with the group; they also praised its production. On November 4, 2002, a beat-heavy remix of \"Let's Go to Bed\" was released as the album's third single in German-speaking Europe by Polydor. It became the No Angels's first single to miss the top ten on the German Singles Chart when it peaked at number twelve. In Austria, the song barely reached the top fifty, while in Switzerland, the funk track failed to chart on the Swiss Singles Chart. Altogether, it sold more than 100,000 copies Europe-wide but emerged as the band's lowest-selling single before their disbandment in 2003. The single's accompanying music video was directed by Marcus Sternberg and filmed inside the New Trade Fair building in Leipzig in early October 2002. It features the girls in black dresses seductively dancing in front of architecture by Gerkan, Marg and Partners and Ian Ritchie Architects. Mousse T. makes a cameo appearance in the video."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"Lipstick Traces (on a Cigarette)\" is a song first recorded by New Orleans singer Benny Spellman in 1962. It was written by Allen Toussaint under the pseudonym Naomi Neville. The song became Spellman's only hit record, peaking at number 28 on the Billboard R&B chart and number 80 on the Billboard Hot 100 pop chart. The flip side of the single was \"Fortune Teller\", made famous by The Rolling Stones cover among others. Toussaint explained the song's origin in an interview with journalist Terry Gross of National Public Radio: \"Well, 'Lipstick Traces'...the guy, Benny Spellman, that sang the bass part on \"Mother-In-Law\" - he didn't know what it was worth at the time we were doing it, but when \"Mother-In-Law\" came out and sold, and went to number one, let's say, Benny Spellman that sang the bass part made sure that everyone within the sound of his voice got to know that he sang that part. And then he would go around - he would gig - based on [the fact that] he sang the low part on \"Mother-In-Law.\" And he encouraged me...with much force, to write him a song that he could use that concept. And one result of that was the song 'Lipstick Traces.'\" \"Lipstick Traces (on a Cigarette)\" was recorded in New Orleans on February 2, 1962. The background vocals were done by label mates Irma Thomas and Willie Harper."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"Listen\" is a song recorded by American singer Beyonc\u00E9. The song was written by Henry Krieger, Scott Cutler, Anne Preven, and Beyonc\u00E9, and produced by The Underdogs, Matt Sullivan and Randy Spendlove for the 2006 musical film Dreamgirls, in which Beyonc\u00E9's character Deena Jones sings the song in an expression of independence from her controlling husband. Columbia Records released \"Listen\" as the lead single from the Dreamgirls: Music from the Motion Picture soundtrack album on December 5, 2006. It additionally appeared as a hidden track on international editions, and on the deluxe edition of Beyonc\u00E9's second solo studio album, B'Day. The Spanish version of the song, \"Oye\", was released on the EP, Irreemplazable, and the Spanish deluxe edition of B'Day. One of four new songs written for the feature version of Dreamgirls (originally a 1981 Broadway musical) \"Listen\" is a soul-R&B song; its lyrics make reference to tenacity, love, the refusal to defer dreams and finally rise towards fame. Its instrumentation includes bass, drums, guitars, keyboards, percussion, and violins, among others. The song was a critical success. Contemporary music critics complimented the strong and emotional vocals of Beyonc\u00E9, and added that the lyrics perfectly elaborate on Deena Jones's life. \"Listen\" won Best Original Song at the 2007 Critics' Choice Awards. It was nominated in the same category at the 2006 International Press Academy Satellite Award, at the 2007 Golden Globe Awards, and at the 2007 Academy Awards. \"Listen\" peaked at number 61 on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart and generally peaked inside the top 20 positions in European countries. It fared better in the United Kingdom where it reached number eight thanks to a live duet performance of Beyonc\u00E9 and Alexandra Burke at The X Factor, where Burke emerged as the winner after singing \"Listen\" during the finale. The song was also covered by Charice and Melanie Amaro during the finale of the first season of the The X Factor in the US, where she emerged as the winner. Two accompanying music videos were filmed for \"Listen\"; the performance version was directed by Diane Martel, and the second one, being Vogue Shoot Version, was directed by Matthew Rolston. \"Listen\" was also a part of her set list on The Beyonc\u00E9 Experience (2007) and I Am...

dbr:Little_Red_Rooster	rdf:type	dbo:MusicalWork ;
	dbo:abstract	"\"Little Red Rooster\" (or \"The Red Rooster\" as it was first titled) is a blues standard credited to arranger and songwriter Willie Dixon. The song was first recorded in 1961 by American blues musician Howlin' Wolf in the Chicago blues style. His vocal and slide guitar playing are key elements of the song. It is rooted in the Delta blues tradition and the theme is derived from folklore. Musical antecedents to \"Little Red Rooster\" appear in earlier songs by blues artists Charlie Patton and Memphis Minnie. A variety of musicians have interpreted and recorded \"Little Red Rooster\". Some add new words and instrumentation to mimic the sounds of animals mentioned in the lyrics. American soul music singer Sam Cooke adapted the song using a more uptempo approach and it became a successful single on both the US rhythm and blues and pop record charts in 1963. Concurrently, Dixon and Howlin' Wolf toured the UK with the American Folk Blues Festival and helped popularize Chicago blues with local rock musicians overseas. The Rolling Stones were among the first British rock groups to record modern electric blues songs. In 1964, they recorded \"Little Red Rooster\" with original member Brian Jones, a key player in the recording. Their rendition, which remains closer to the original arrangement than Cooke's, became a number one record in the UK and continues to be the only blues song to reach the top of the British chart. The Stones frequently performed it on television and in concert and released several live recordings of the song. \"Little Red Rooster\" continues to be performed and recorded, making it one of Willie Dixon's best-known compositions."@en ;

Jackie was originally going to sing the song with his brother, Michael, but Jackie's role instead went to Jermaine Jackson, whose availability for the album was in question until the last minute. The rest of the Jacksons sang the chorus along with Michael and Jermaine. The song received mixed reactions from critics. The video was probably best known for Michael not being available, and the use of a wax dummy in his place throughout the video. Paula Abdul replaced Perri Lister as the video's choreographer, in which various scenes of torture are displayed with the Jacksons being on the receiving end of most of it. The shoot was an expensive and arduous affair that neither Michael nor Jermaine took part in, and it ultimately bankrupted the production company. The song peaked at #17 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, making it the second best selling single on the album, behind \"State of Shock\". It also peaked at #26 on the UK charts."@en ;

The video features the band again on tour in the United States, as in the \"Everybody in the Place\" video, but this time on the West Coast. There is footage showing local flavour, the band in concert and on the beach.

	dbo:abstract	"\"Keep It Together\" is a song by American singer Madonna from her fourth studio album Like a Prayer (1989). It was released on January 30, 1990 by Sire Records as the sixth and final single from the album in the United States, Canada and Japan. Written and produced by Madonna and Stephen Bray, the main inspiration behind \"Keep It Together\" was Madonna's relationship with her family\u2014whom she dearly missed after her divorce from actor Sean Penn. The song was dedicated to American funk and soul band Sly and the Family Stone. The lyrics deal with the realization of how important Madonna's family has been to her life. A pop and funk song consisting of an upbeat rhythm and groove, \"Keep It Together\" features percussion, banjo and a conga. In the United Kingdom and some other countries, \"Dear Jessie\" (1989) served as the final single from the album and \"Keep It Together\" was not released as a separate single at all. Receiving mixed reviews from critics, \"Keep It Together\" was compared to the work of Sister Sledge, especially their song \"We Are Family\". The song was a commercial success, reaching a peak of number eight on the Billboard Hot 100 and Canadian charts, while topping the dance chart in the United States. In Australia it reached the top of the charts as a double A-side single with \"Vogue\". \"Keep It Together\" has been performed as the closing song of the 1990 Blond Ambition World Tour. The performances were inspired by the 1971 science fiction film, A Clockwork Orange, and during the introduction, Madonna sang a verse from \"Family Affair\" by Sly and the Family Stone."@en ;

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Try_Some,_Buy_Some>	rdf:type	dbo:MusicalWork ;
	dbo:abstract	"\"Try Some, Buy Some\" is a song written by English musician George Harrison, first released in 1971 as a single by former Ronettes lead singer Ronnie Spector. The latter recorded this and other Harrison compositions, such as \"You\" and \"When Every Song Is Sung\", in London for a planned comeback album on the Beatles' Apple Records. The project was co-produced by her husband at the time, Phil Spector, whose temporary withdrawal from music-making in 1966 had forced Ronnie to reluctantly abandon her own career. After the single became only a minor hit, and following recording sessions that had been hampered by the producer's erratic behaviour, the proposed album was cancelled. In 1973, Harrison added his own vocal onto a new mix of the instrumental track and included the result on his album Living in the Material World. Harrison wrote \"Try Some, Buy Some\" during sessions for All Things Must Pass, his successful 1970 triple album, also co-produced by Spector. The song's austere melody was influenced by Harrison composing on a keyboard instrument rather than guitar. The lyrics reflect his perception of God amid temptations associated with the material world and take the form of a recollection of his first spiritual awakening. Ronnie Spector later admitted to being unable to understand the concept and disliking the song, and commentators have duly noted its unsuitability as a vehicle for her comeback. \"Try Some, Buy Some\" is notable for the extent to which Phil Spector employed his Wall of Sound production, as well as for being a significant commercial failure for Spector, in the manner of his ambitious 1966 production \"River Deep \u2013 Mountain High\", by Ike & Tina Turner. The recording features a choir and long, lavishly orchestrated instrumental passages, the musical arrangement for which was supplied by John Barham. Besides Harrison, the backing musicians include Leon Russell, Pete Ham, Klaus Voormann and Jim Gordon. The single's B-side was \"Tandoori Chicken\", an upbeat song in the rockabilly style. Some commentators question the inclusion of Harrison's reading of \"Try Some, Buy Some\" on Living in the Material World and view it in an unfavourable light, citing his struggle to sing in a key suited to the former Ronette. Having long been unavailable following its 1971 release \u2013 during which time she divorced Spector and attempted to relaunch her career without him \u2013 Ronnie Spector's version was reissued in 2010 on the compilation Come and Get It: The Best of Apple Records. A longtime admirer of the song, David Bowie covered \"Try Some, Buy Some\" on his 2003 album Reality and performed it on his tours in support of the album."@en ;

It was released in October 1971 as the second single and title track from the album Coat of Many Colors. She composed the song in 1969, while traveling with Porter Wagoner on a tour bus. (She explained in her 1994 memoir, My Life and Other Unfinished Business, because she could find no paper, as the song came to her, she wrote it on the back of a dry cleaning receipt from one of Wagoner's suits; when the song became a hit, Wagoner had the receipt framed.) She recorded the song in April 1971, making it the title song for her Coat of Many Colors album. The song reached #4 on the U.S. country singles charts. The song tells of how Parton's mother stitched together a coat for her daughter out of rags given to the family. As she sewed, she told her child the biblical story of Joseph and his Coat of Many Colors. The excited child, \"with patches on my britches and holes in both my shoes\", rushed to school, \"just to find the others laughing and making fun of me\" for wearing a coat made of rags."@en ;

Staged as an episode of the variety program Hee Haw in which Heston is a guest star, the video also features The Eels dressed as Abraham Lincoln, Mahatma Gandhi, and John Lennon (all notable advocates of nonviolence who were assassinated). The single marks the Eels' first release since their album Wonderful, Glorious earlier in 2013. The novelty song evoked strong responses in conservative media for several reasons, including the repeated implication by Carrey that gun obsession is inversely related to American male phallus-size anxiety."@en ;

The song's narrator describes the scenario of the previous night in which, due to various influences including alcohol consumption, he was compelled to initiate telephone contact with a former romantic interest. His ensuing conversation with her apparently fails to lead to a resolution, an outcome which he believes in retrospect should have been obvious. On one level, the narrator expresses regret that the interaction was distressing for both parties. On the other hand, the song's narrative may be perceived as having a redemptive tone as the narrator implies that, through these events, he was forced to recognize his inability to 'keep it all inside' with respect to this relationship."@en ;

The ballad version of \"Flavor Of Life\" was arranged by Utada as well as two other professionals; the original version was arranged by Utada, and the Antidote mix of the song was arranged by Alexis Smith, who provided additional arrangement for Ultra Blue tracks such as \"Keep Tryin'\" and \"This is Love\". The ballad version of \"Flavor Of Life\" was featured as the insert song for the popular drama or dorama, \"Hana Yori Dango 2,\" which averaged over 21% viewership in its timeslot.

It was the second of two singles from that album, the other being \"Voices in the Sky\". \"Ride My See-Saw\" is one of John Lodge's signature high-energy rock and roll songs, and is sometimes regarded as his most popular composition for the Moody Blues, along with \"I'm Just a Singer (In a Rock and Roll Band)\". The single was released later in October 1968, with Mike Pinder's \"A Simple Game\" on the B-side. That track was sampled by Phi Life Cypher on the track \"Free\" on the album Higher Forces. The Four Tops' recording of \"A Simple Game\" went to #3 in the UK charts in 1972. On the album, the song is preceded by the spoken-word piece \"Departure\", and laughter from the end of that track bleeds into the opening of \"Ride My See-Saw\" itself. This was removed for the single release. At most of the Moody Blues' concerts, \"Ride My See-Saw\" is the encore presentation at the end of the shows. When performed live, it is usually opened by a lengthy keyboard and drum duet as the band members make their way back out to the stage for the encore."@en ;

Lyrically, Minaj wonders how a lover can see through her. The song was met with generally positive reviews from critics, commenting on Minaj's lyrical playfulness and accepting the different musical sound. The music video was shot over the weekend of October 1, 2010 and was directed by Diane Martel and was later premiered on October 27. The concept is a boy-girl relationship drama and features Minaj and her love fighting and arguing, with him threatening to leave her while Minaj tries to apologize. The video was met with positive reviews from critics, with many calling it more natural and deep than her fun and costume-filled videos. Minaj has promoted the song in several live appearances on The Wendy Williams Show, Late Show with David Letterman, Live with Regis and Kelly, Saturday Night Live, and 106 & Park."@en ;

It appeared on their debut album Club Classics Vol. One (\"Keep on Movin'\" in the United States) and was released as its second single on 29 May 1989. \"Back to Life\" was one of two songs on the album featuring British R&B singer Caron Wheeler and gained success in both the United Kingdom and in the United States. The album version of the song was an a cappella which was remixed and re-recorded before being released as a single. Two new versions were produced \u2014 the first taking the original recording with instrumentation added, and the second was a re-working of the song with new lyrics and chorus (also adding \"However Do You Want Me\" to the title). It was the second version that became most popular. \"Back to Life (However Do You Want Me)\" peaked at number four on the Billboard Hot 100, becoming one of Soul II Soul's most successful singles in the United States (and the only one to enter in the top 10). In the United Kingdom it performed even better, reaching number one in the UK Singles Chart for four weeks in June 1989. For a time, the album was packaged together with a CD3 single including the new versions of the song. In 2006, Slant Magazine ranked the song at number 57 in their list of the \"100 Greatest Dance Songs\".

	dbo:abstract	"\"Back to School (Mini Maggit)\" is a song composed by the American alternative metal band Deftones. It is an altered version of the song \"Pink Maggit\" from the band's 2000 album White Pony. Shortly after the album's initial release, in a contentious move by the band's label, Maverick Records, it was re-released with \"Back to School (Mini Maggit)\" added on. The song's style has been described as nu metal. \"Back to School (Mini Maggit)\" was released as both a single and as an EP package; the single was released shortly before the EP. Vocalist Chino Moreno: \"This album right here [the White Pony re-release] is not the album that we turned in to the label. As far as we're concerned, the first edition was the record. Done. Then, they talked us into re-releasing it with another song on it, and it's not like I'm against the song or whatever, but I liked the sequence we had when we first turned it in. When this version came out, a little part inside all of us felt like: 'Fuck! We just totally compromised.' And I know that a lot of our fans felt bad about it too.\" The band also specifically regretted the presence of \"Back to School\" on the re-release of the album, as Moreno stated in an interview with German rock magazine Visions: \"'Back to School' was a mistake. A calculated song, that had been built up with only one aim in mind: It should be a single. ... 'Back to School' was released because I was an idiot. I wanted to prove something [to the record company]. Months later, after White Pony was released, they wanted us to do a new version of \"Pink Maggit\". They said we lost our heaviness, and there were no more singles on the album. First, I wanted to stick this idea up my ass, but then I thought: 'I'm gonna show those fuckers how easy it is to create a hit-single.' And so I rapped a hip hop part on that song, we shortened it and half an hour later, the hit-single was ready to roll on.\""@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"Hilli (At The Top Of The World)\" is the second single from the album Kurr released by Icelandic band Amiina. The song features American musician Lee Hazlewood in his last recording and collaboration. The vocal parts consist of Lee telling a story accompanied by a reworked version of the song \"Hilli\" whose original version is available on Kurr. The story has a strong environmental message. It starts by setting the scene of the simple life of the people from the top of the world (a \"magical island\") whose spirit is found by the snow laden world they live in. It conjures up an idyllic scene of children catching snowflakes - \"they fall like candy....they open their mouths and gulp down the flakes, 'cos nothing on earth tastes so sweet.\" Then, the story turns darker as on the horizon the people see fire \"and the water did rise and the snow started melting away.\" The fire represents man's environmental damage. The snow started to melt and spread throughout the world as light, running upstream and bursting through fountains and springs. At first the people around the world were not shocked by what they saw, not understanding what had caused it....\"even their teachers did not know what the bright light was for.\" All were initially touched by this light, but as they \"looked all around\" and up at the sky, they \"realised the damage they had done.\" It ends with penance: \"as they started to cry, their tears filled the sky as the dark clouds formed above. And then the heavens opened and the rains came to show them, that the world needs a little more love.\" Before the single was released it was rumored that a cover version of Lee's song \"Leather and Lace\" would be the single's second track, but this turned out to be just a rumor.[citation needed] The song was featured on the Aled Jones Sunday morning show on BBC's Radio Two in 2008, and made such an impact it was repeated the following week at the request of many listeners.[citation needed]"@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"Long Distance\" is a song by American recording artist Brandy Norwood. It was written by Bruno Mars, Philip Lawrence, Jeff Bhasker, and Rodney \"Darkchild\" Jerkins, and was co-produced by Jerkins and Mars for her fifth studio album Human (2008) based on a demo by Mars. It appears as the seventh track on the album on which it is interluded by a telephone conversation between two lovers (Brandy & an unidentified male voice). The lyrics of the piano\u2013led power ballad describe the protagonist's emotional state towards an ongoing long-distance relationship, which leaves her in depression. The song was the second and final single to precede the Human album. Upon its release in October 2008, it garnered a generally mixed reception from music critics who applauded the song's lyrical content, its vocals and the hymnlike character, while others found the song would sound too clich\u00E9d and outdated. Never released outside North America, \"Long Distance\" managed to peak at number 38 on the Billboard Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart but failed to enter the Hot 100; though it became the second consecutive Human single after \"Right Here (Departed)\" to reach the top spot on the Hot Dance Club Play chart. An alternate pop remix, which featured a different instruments, was serviced to mainstream radio in February 2009. The accompanying music video for the single was directed by Chris Robinson and filmed at the Park Plaza Hotel in Los Angeles in November 2008. Depiciting Norwood as a singing diva, who remembers moments with her distant lover, the video shifts from black-and-white to color photography during its bridge. Both Mars and Lawrence appear as pianists in a sequence of the clip."@en ;

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Galang_(song)>	rdf:type	dbo:MusicalWork ;
	dbo:abstract	"\"Galang\" is a song by British musician M.I.A. from her debut album Arular. It was released on Showbiz Records in 2003 as her first single, which pressed 500 vinyl copies, gaining immediate international recognition via radio airplay, fashion shows, club rotations and internet filesharing. \"Galang\" was re-released on 1 November 2004 via XL Recordings as the second single from the album released by the label and was released for a third time as \"Galang '05\" on 11 October 2005 by the label and in the US by Interscope Records. It is written by Maya \"M.I.A.\" Arulpragasam, Justine Frischmann, Ross Orton and Steve Mackey. It first appeared on M.I.A.'s six song demo tape in 2003, her official MySpace account on 9 June 2004 and was later reworked slightly by Orton and Mackey who received production credit for the song. \"Galang\" was the second song M.I.A. wrote on her Roland MC-505, intending for the piece to be performed by Frischmann's band Elastica. Inspired by her experiences and observations of life in London, M.I.A. wrote the song to encourage her friends in the band to continue to make music. However, after cowriting the song, Frischmann convinced M.I.A. to record \"Galang\" herself, complimenting the piece's lyrical narrative and music direction. Musically, \"Galang\" is a dance-oriented midtempo song, combining elements of dancehall, electro, jungle, and world music. M.I.A.'s voice is heard in a whooping chant-like rap over polyrhythmic Roland MC-505 arrangements of beats, drums, claps and synths along the song's bassline. The word 'galang' comes from the Jamaican patois slang word for 'go on'. The lyrics of the song are ambiguous, and could be interpreted differently by listeners, containing hidden innuendo to cannabis use, sex, and violence and acknowledgement of songs such as \"London Calling\". The song comments on a weed smoking young character in Iraq War/post 9/11 period London, caught in street battles, paranoid and chased by police while looking for work in the city. \"Galang\" was a major critical success amongst contemporary and older critics, who frequently hail its sound and lyrics as novel, reflective and ahead of their time. It charted in the UK and Canada and reached number 11 on the US Billboard Hot Dance Singles Sales. The song's accompanying music video, directed by Ruben Fleischer and art directed by M.I.A. portrays the singer in several costumes roaming and dancing amidst stencils of her single artwork and images from her 2001 Alternative Turner Prize nominated exhibition, animated in the background. With the video, scholars note that multiple M.I.A.s appear against a backdrop of militaristic animated graffiti, utilising symbolism of urban Britain and war, tiger imagery and Tamil script stencils. The video was given vitality by the bold use of day-glo colour and her distinct design technique in the art, her costumes and music, triggering the new rave revolution upon its release. \"Galang\" appeared on several publications' lists of the best song of the year, decade and of all time. The song's rapid international propagation through radio, fashion shows and the internet along with \"Sunshowers\" made it one of the first viral phenomena in the modern age, and affirmed M.I.A as one of the first popstars of the digital age. \"Galang\" has been covered by jazz pianist Vijay Iyer and is officially remixed by Serj Tankian and Dave Kelly, both appearing on the B-side of its 2005 reedition. The song has appeared in the feature film Pride and Glory, a commercial for Honda Civic and the television series Entourage. M.I.A. performed the song on Sen kv\u00E4ll med Luuk and Late Night with Conan O'Brien and performs the song on her concert tours, first on her Arular Tour and most recently the // / Y / Tour where it was well appreciated by fans. Hailed as one of M.I.A.'s defining tracks, her persona in the song has influenced numerous artists worldwide, led to M.I.A.'s acceptance by a generation who emulated her music, style and fashion, and cemented her position as a global indie cultural icon."@en ;

At the tail end of \"Happy Jack\", Townshend can be heard shouting \"I saw you!\", and it is said that he was noticing drummer Keith Moon trying to join in surreptitiously to add his voice to the recording, something the rest of the band disliked.

After the song's success, the group would release their last Motown album, Moving Violation, before leaving the label for good in 1976. It charted at no.3 on the R&B singles chart and no.15 on the Hot 100 in the US, but wasn't a hit in the UK.

Many critics noted similarities between the song's composition and materials by other artists including Enya, Evanescence and Ryan Tedder-produced songs. The song received acclaim by critics who praised Welch's vocals and its balladry nature. An accompanying music video for the song was released online on 8 March 2012. It was directed by Tabitha Denholm and stars actor Jamie Campbell Bower, who plays Welch's love interest. The video features the pair together skating and shots of a dirty water trickling down Welch's face and hands are shown. Upon the release of the video, critics praised Welch's gothic look and the video's dark atmosphere. Florence and the Machine added the song to the set list of their second worldwide Ceremonials Tour (2011\u20132012) where the song was performed during the encore of the concerts along with \"No Light, No Light\"."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"Nobody's Child\" is a song written by Cy Coben and Mel Foree. It was first recorded by Hank Snow in 1949 and it became one of his standards, although it did not chart for him. The song has been covered a number of times in the UK; it was on Lonnie Donegan's first album in 1956 (which went to #2 as an album in the UK), it was covered by Tony Sheridan and the Beat Brothers (The Beatles) in 1961 in Hamburg, and in 1969 Karen Young took the song to #6 on the UK charts and used it as the title track on her album. In 1969 Hank Williams Jr. did a version of it that made it to #46 on the US Country charts. The Traveling Wilburys' 1990 version made it to #44 on the UK charts. The song lyrics are about an orphan whom no one wants to adopt because he is blind: I'm nobody's child, I'm nobody's childJust like a flower I'm growing wildNo mommy's kisses and no daddy's smile Nobody wants me, I'm nobody's child"@en .

dbr:Paralyzer	rdf:type	dbo:MusicalWork ;
	dbo:abstract	"\"Paralyzer\" is the first single from Canadian alternative rock band Finger Eleven's fifth album, Them vs. You vs. Me. It was released in March 2007. Finger Eleven's frontman Scott Anderson has said that the single has a feel distinct from the rest of Finger Eleven's music, possessing more of a funk rock or dance-rock sound. However, the song has also been characterized as alternative rock. The song received high airplay in both the United States and Canada, and was performed live on the March 14, 2007 episode of The Tonight Show with Jay Leno and again ten months later on January 9, 2008, in a testament to the longevity of the single's success. The song has surpassed \"One Thing\" to be Finger Eleven's most successful single. The single has three versions. One is the original CD version, while the other two are radio edit versions, in which the line containing the word \"shitty\" is either censored or replaced with shady. The song alludes to the band's prior hit \"One Thing\" with the lyric \"I should just stay home, if one thing really means one\"; in addition, the recurring guitar riff quotes The Cars' \"Moving in Stereo.\" The style of the song has been compared to (though inspired by) \"Take Me Out\", a 2004 single by indie rock band Franz Ferdinand. Finger Eleven occasionally performed \"Take Me Out\" during the middle of Paralyzer in live performances as a part of a medley along with \"Trampled Under Foot\" by Led Zeppelin and \"Another Brick in the Wall (Part II)\" by Pink Floyd. The song is played during the New York Islanders warm-ups at the Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum.[citation needed] It has been featured on the television series Gossip Girl and Greek. It is also a playable song in the rhythm game Rock Revolution by Konami; although the game's producers have stated that all songs will be covers, the song is one of two for which the game uses the original master recording (the other being \"Given Up\" by Linkin Park). The song is also a playable song in the rhythm game Band Hero by Activision. This song is even on the Rock Band Network, and was recently introduced as DLC into Rocksmith by Ubisoft. At the time of the song's release, it was used in countless YouTube videos as a background track."@en ;

The Canadian singer, who had achieved several hits from 1968 to 1971, had not had a Top 100 single since September 1971, and had been without a record label since early 1973. Nevertheless, he said in a 1974 interview, \"I never mentally admitted defeat in spite of three years off the charts.\" He formed his own label, Ice Records, and personally financed the recording session that produced \"Rock Me Gently\". He could afford to record only two sides, and deciding the second side was good enough to be an A-Side, he put an instrumental of Rock Me Gently on its B-Side. The single impressed Capitol Records executives, who signed Kim to a deal. \"Rock Me Gently\" debuted on the Hot 100 on June 22, 1974, and took 14 weeks to reach #1 on September 28. It also rose to #2 on the UK Singles Chart, and #10 in Ireland, and remains his only charting song in either the UK or Ireland. Even the instrumental B-Side received substantial airplay on R&B stations. It would be Kim's last top 10 hit in either country. Part of the song was used in a 1970s UK TV commercial for Lever Brothers' Jif cleaning cream, using the lyric \"When Jif\u2019s your cleaner - Tough dirt goes - Away so gently - And it shows - Your home has never been loved like this before\".

This was featured on the 2001 compilation album Now That's What I Call Music! 6. On the 2000s \"Around the World in 100 Hours\" Black & Blue promo trip, Backstreet Boys sang an a cappella version of the song every continent they landed on.

To this day, \"Tempted\" still gets moderate airplay from Classic hits, Classic rock and adult alternative-formatted radio stations.

The song was written by Pet Shop Boys, Miranda Cooper, Brian Higgins and his production team Xenomania, and produced by Higgins and Xenomania. Described as a \"synth pop ballad\", \"The Loving Kind\" was originally written for inclusion on Pet Shop Boys' Yes (2009) before being given to Girls Aloud. Upon its release in January 2009, \"The Loving Kind\" entered the UK Singles Chart at number ten, thereby continuing their six-year streak of top ten hits. In the music video, the group portrays the \"good\" and \"bad\" Girls Aloud as they perform in mirrored boxes. \"The Loving Kind\" was promoted through numerous live appearances and was performed on 2009's Out of Control Tour. The song was largely praised by most contemporary music critics, although maligned by others for its similarities with \"Call the Shots\"."@en ;

The first features a live performance of the song in collaboration with the University of Notre Dame Marching Band. The second features a giant Rube Goldberg machine, constructed to operate in time with the song. The popularity of the second music video of the song has been compared to that of the band's video for \"Here It Goes Again\", helping to boost live performances and single song sales for the group but did not significantly improve sales of the Colour album. Difficulties in marketing and distribution of the videos with their corporate label, EMI, led the band to form their own independent label shortly after the videos' releases. The song was featured in the films The Joneses, Freakonomics and The Vow. It was also featured in the video game Top Spin 4.

These CDs were indistinguishable from the correct CD version 2, but had the audio tracks from CD version 1 instead of CD version 2. They did however have the correct \"Thursday's Child\" video on the enhanced CD portion. The mispressed CDs quickly became a collector's item.[citation needed] In a performance for VH1 Storytellers, Bowie revealed that the title of the song was prompted by the memory of the autobiography of actress Eartha Kitt. The book, also called Thursday's Child, used to be a favourite of his when he was 14 years old. A clip from the song was featured in the fourth season premiere of the MTV cartoon Daria.

	dbo:abstract	"\"Touch Me in the Morning\" is a popular song recorded by Diana Ross on the Motown label. In 1973 it became her second solo No. 1 single (and 14th over her career) on the Billboard Hot 100 . It was conceived by then-unproven songwriter and producer Michael Masser. He had been recruited by Motown CEO Berry Gordy and A&R chief Suzanne de Passe. Masser teamed up with the proven ballad lyricist Ron Miller to write it. According to Masser, in a video documentary about Ross, she \"always tried to push hard to get the vocals right for this particular song\", calling it a \"draining experience\" that resulted in several near-emotional breakdowns when she wasn't up to her abilities. It was recorded in the early morning hours, as was her custom after she began raising her children. In a Barbara Walters Mother's Day interview special, her second-oldest daughter, Tracee Ellis Ross, said Diana would put them to bed and record all night, in order to wake her children and send them to school the next morning. Motown released the song as a single and it hit No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 singles chart, becoming her longest-charting record until 1980, remaining on the chart for 21 weeks. It also spent a week at No. 1 on the adult contemporary chart, her first No. 1 on that chart. Sherlie Matthews, Clydie King and Venetta Fields sang background vocals. It marked a turning point in both the careers of Diana Ross and Michael Masser: it reinvigorated her singing career, coming immediately after her Academy Award nomination for Best Actress in her acting debut, Lady Sings the Blues; it introduced Masser to an audience that would become accustomed to his prowess at writing good love songs."@en ;

It marked a departure from much of the band's previous work as it incorporates a more electronic-influenced sound as well as elements from new wave music. \"Up in the Air\" was released on March 18, 2013, as the lead single from the album. It premiered on the same day from the International Space Station, after being launched aboard a spacecraft loaded with scientific experiments and other equipments. Critical reception to the song was mostly positive, with much of the praise going to its sonic variety and introspective lyrics. The track peaked at number three on the Alternative Songs in the United States and garnered significant commercial outcomes internationally, reaching the top fifteen of Finland, Lebanon, Portugal, and Russia. The accompanying music video, directed by Leto, features conceptual imagery filled with references to different art forms.

	dbo:abstract	"\"Useless\" is Depeche Mode's thirty-fourth UK single, released on 20 October 1997, and the fourth and final single for the album Ultra. It was released with \"Home\" as a double A-side in the US due to \"Useless\" getting airplay on US radio stations before \"Home\" was announced. \"Useless\" is an industrial rock track in the vein of \"Barrel of a Gun\", with more of a pop twist. The single remix, by Alan Moulder, changes the intro and has an updated beat (similar to the changes done to the 7\" versions of \"Walking In My Shoes\" and \"Condemnation\"), and adds some extra synth during the chorus. It also contains more grainy vocals. The \"The Kruder + Dorfmeister Session\" is a very prominent remix by the DJ duo of the same name. On the US single, the single remix is replaced by the CJ Bolland Ultrasonar Edit. There are no actual B-sides for \"Useless\", except for remixes and live versions of the song. Some versions of the CD single feature the videos for \"Barrel of a Gun\" and \"It's No Good\", accessible when the disc is inserted into a PC. The 1997 music video for \"Useless\" was the last Depeche Mode video to be directed by Anton Corbijn for more than eight years.

	dbo:abstract	"\"Denver Dream\" is a song by American singer Donna Summer, released in 1974. This was her first collaboration with Giorgio Moroder and Pete Bellotte, a songwriting team that would stay together until 1981 and produce all of Summer's biggest disco hits. At this time Summer was living in Munich, Germany and singing backup for groups such as Three Dog Night. Through her job as a backup singer she met Moroder and before long he started using her as a lead vocalist. This single also marked the first usage of Summer's stage name (she had previously been credited as Donna Gaines, but had anglicised her married name to Austrian actor Helmut Sommer). It was released in The Netherlands, Belgium and France in 1974, but did not make any particular impact on the chart. The B-side, \"Something's in the Wind\", would, in 1977, be re-worked into the single, \"Back in Love Again\", which would become a top-40 UK hit. Both sides of this single now appear on the CD compilation \"Giorgio Moroder - Vol. 2-On The Groove Train 1974-85\""@en ;

After watching Slumdog Millionaire record executives Jimmy Iovine and Ron Fair wanted to turn \"Jai Ho\" into a \"pop record without deviating from the original melody\" and asked Scherzinger to do her own interpretation of the song. The song was credited as \"A.R. Rahman and The Pussycat Dolls featuring Nicole Scherzinger\" which caused[citation needed] the eventual split of the group. Upon its release, the song received generally positive reviews from music critics, applauding it as a great adaption. \"Jai Ho! (You Are My Destiny)\" was commercially successful. On the U.S. Billboard Hot 100, the song debuted at number 100. The following week it peaked at number 15, experiencing one of the largest upward movements on the chart. Internationally, the song charted strongly, topping the charts in countries including in Australia, Finland, Israel and Ireland, as well as peaking within the top ten of the charts in countries such as New Zealand and the United Kingdom. The music video was shot in Vienna, Austria at a Tramway Museum, recreating the last scene from the movie Slumdog Millionaire. In the United Kingdom, the English-language version of the song was sung by various voice actors of British children's shows during the 2009 Children in Need Promotional dance video. It was also sung in The Official BBC Children in Need Medley, which topped the UK Singles Chart for two weeks in late-2009. The Pussycat dolls have performed \"Jai Ho!

A snippet of the track was first previewed on Kanye West's 2007 Can't Tell Me Nothing mixtape and featured an additional spoken word verse delivered by Malik Yusef."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"Teenage Dream\" is a song by American singer Katy Perry. It was released as the second single from her third studio album of the same name on July 23, 2010. Perry and Bonnie McKee wrote many songs with youthful themes in mind, but they were rejected by producers Benny Blanco and Dr. Luke. Blanco showed them The Teenagers' single \"Homecoming\", and McKee imagined \"Teenage Dream\" as a throwback song to the euphoric feelings of being in love as a teenager. They met with Max Martin in Perry's hometown of Santa Barbara, California and started writing the track at Playback Recording Studio, which Perry later described as a pure moment for her. After Perry recorded her vocals, McKee presented her idea and the chorus was rewritten. Perry also described the song as reminiscent of her youth while contemplating her future marriage to Russell Brand. Musically, \"Teenage Dream\" is a mid-tempo pop song with a retro sound. It is styled in the genres of power pop and electropop, while taking influence from other genres such as disco and pop rock, while there are slight elements of hard rock during the chorus. Perry starts the song in a high-pitched voice while her vocals grow stronger as the song progresses. Lyrically, \"Teenage Dream\" discusses being with a lover who makes one feel young again. \"Teenage Dream\" received generally positive reviews from music critics, some praising its nature and sound, but with others dismissing its lyrics as \"too carefree and immature\". The song has topped the Billboard Hot 100, becoming Perry's third number-one single on that chart, and her second consecutive number-one single after \"California Gurls\". \"Teenage Dream\" has been certified seven times platinum in the United States, as well as receiving platinum and multi-platinum certifications in other countries. A music video for the song was filmed in various locations around Perry's hometown in Santa Barbara, California and was directed by Yoann Lemoine (a.k.a. Woodkid). The video showcases Perry being in love with her high school lover. Perry has performed the song on Saturday Night Live, the 2010 Teen Choice Awards, 53rd Grammy Awards and other occasions. \"Teenage Dream\" was nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance, becoming Perry's third nomination in the category. Rolling Stone listed the song as the fourth best song of 2010 and second best song of the 2010s by Billboard. The song is featured in the Best Buy edition of Just Dance 3. The song has been covered numerous times appearing on such as American Idol, The Voice, and Glee."@en ;

This song is one of only three songs to top the British charts twice with different lyrics, the others being \"Mambo No. 5\" (in versions by Lou Bega and Bob the Builder) and \"Do They Know It's Christmas?\" (by Band Aid and Band Aid 30). It also regularly reappears in the UK singles chart around major football tournaments involving the England team.

	dbo:abstract	"\"Titanium\" is a song by French DJ and music producer David Guetta, featuring vocals by Australian recording artist Sia. Taken from Guetta's fifth studio album, Nothing but the Beat, the song was written by Sia, Guetta, Giorgio Tuinfort and Afrojack. Production was also handled by Guetta, Tuinfort and Afrojack. \"Titanium\" was initially released for digital download on August 8, 2011, as the first of four promotional singles from the album. It was later released as the album's fourth single in December 2011. The song originally featured the vocals of American recording artist Mary J. Blige, whose version of the song leaked online in July 2011. \"Titanium\" is a ballad which draws from the genres of house, pop and urban-dance. The song's lyrics are about inner strength. Sia's vocals on \"Titanium\" received comparisons to those by Fergie and the song was also musically compared to Coldplay's work. Critics were positive towards the song and noted it as one of the standout tracks from Nothing but the Beat. \"Titanium\" attained top 10 positions in several major music markets, including Australia, Austria, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, The Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and the United States. In the United Kingdom, it peaked at number one, becoming Guetta's fifth number-one single on the chart and Sia's first. The song's accompanying music video premiered on December 21, 2011 but does not feature appearances by Guetta or Sia. Instead, the video focuses on a young boy, played by actor Ryan Lee, with supernatural powers. Along with other songs, \"Titanium\" was pulled from radio stations in the US after the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting."@en ;

A remixed version featuring Lady Gaga was released later. Musically, the song consists of simple lyrics and hidden innuendos, with Gaga and Beyonc\u00E9 trading verses with each other, in the remix. The lyrics refer to putting up a show on camera. The song received generally mixed reviews from most of the critics, who noted that Gaga's featured appearance failed to add anything to the tune. The original version charted in the lower regions of the charts of Australia and its Urban chart, Spain, United Kingdom and on the US R&B charts. The remixed version charted at sixty-five on the Billboard Hot 100, and topped the Hot Dance Club Songs chart. It also charted in Australia and its Urban chart, the Czech Republic, New Zealand, while it bubbled under the main charts of Belgium. A music video was created to accompany the song featuring Gaga. It portrayed her and Knowles in a number of costumes, brandishing colorful guns towards men and paying homage to the film Reservoir Dogs and pinup legend Bettie Page. It received mixed feedback from critics who called it un-interesting, and felt that it did not present anything new. However, they complimented the costumes and the cinematic homage of the video. The video went on to win the BET award for Video of the Year."@en ;

It was released by LaFace Records and Arista Records as the lead single from Usher's second studio album, My Way on August 5, 1997. \"You Make Me Wanna...\" was written by Usher along with Jermaine Dupri and Manuel Seal, who both produced the tune. An R&B, soul and pop ballad in C minor, it makes use of acoustic guitar, hi-hat and bell instrumentation. The song focuses on a love triangle relationship, with the protagonist wishing to leave his girlfriend for his erstwhile best friend, with a hook in which Usher states, \"You make me wanna leave the one I'm with and start a new relationship with you\". The record received favorable reviews from critics, and won a Billboard Music Award, a Soul Train Music Award, and a WQHT Hip Hop Award, and was nominated for a Grammy Award. \"You Make Me Wanna...\" appeared on several record charts, topping the UK Singles Chart and the US Hot R&B Singles, logging the second-longest run by a male artist on the latter. It also reached the top ten on the Billboard Hot 100, US Pop Songs, Canadian Singles Chart, Dutch Top 40 and ARIA Singles Chart.

On the album the song is preceded by a one-minute instrumental intro featuring a Shepard tone melody, which is reprised in the ending of \"Teo Torriatte\": this was intended to create a \"circle\" in the album, typical, for example, of Pink Floyd's albums. After its release in 1976, it was played by Queen on every subsequent tour. At the 1992 Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert, the song was co-performed by Queen and guests Joe Elliot and Slash.

	dbo:abstract	"\"Bring Me to Life\" is a song by American rock band Evanescence. It was written by Amy Lee, Ben Moody, and David Hodges and produced by Dave Fortman. It also features guest vocals from Paul McCoy of the band 12 Stones. Wind-up released \"Bring Me to Life\" on April 22, 2003 as the lead single from Evanescence's debut studio album, Fallen (2003). The song is associated with the nu metal, gothic metal and rap rock genres. According to Lee, \"Bring Me to Life\" has several meanings and inspirations; its subjects are an incident in a restaurant, open-mindedness, and waking up to the things which are missing in the protagonist's life. Lee later revealed that the song was inspired by her long-time friend and husband Josh Hartzler. Critical response to the song was mostly positive, with critics praising the melody of the song, Lee's vocals and their accompaniment by McCoy. Following the inclusion of \"Bring Me to Life\" on the Daredevil soundtrack, it has become a commercial and critical success topping the charts in Australia, the United Kingdom and Italy. It charted in the top ten in more than fifteen countries including the United States, Argentina, Germany and New Zealand. \"Bring Me to Life\" was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) and twice platinum by the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA). The lyrics of the song have been interpreted as a call for new life in Jesus Christ, which helped the song to chart on the Christian rock charts. The band won in the category for Best Hard Rock Performance at the 46th Grammy Awards where the song was also nominated for Best Rock Song. The accompanying music video was directed by Philipp St\u00F6lzl; it shows Lee singing and climbing on a skyscraper while having nightmares in her bedroom. \"Bring Me to Life\" was part of the set list during the Fallen and The Open Door Tour. Many artists recorded cover versions of the song, including the classical singer Katherine Jenkins and American pianist, John Tesh. The song was also used on several television shows."@en ;

It remains the group's most successful single in terms of chart position, becoming a number two hit. It was kept from the UK number one spot by charity single \"You'll Never Walk Alone\" by supergroup The Crowd in the summer of 1985. It also made the top 10 in Ireland, Norway and France. \"Kayleigh\" is the band's sole appearance on the USA's Billboard Hot 100, hitting number 74 in October 1985. The song received a great deal of media exposure in the UK. 41 Independent Local Radio stations in Britain had the track A-rated on their playlists and it became the most played single on BBC Radio 1. The band also made appearances on television shows such as Wogan and Top of the Pops. The promotional video for the single was shot in Berlin, where the Misplaced Childhood album was recorded, and featured Tamara Nowy, a German woman who subsequently married lead singer Fish, and Robert Mead, the boy portrayed on the sleeve of the album and the single. The song was performed by Fish at the Nelson Mandela 70th Birthday Tribute at Wembley Stadium, with Midge Ure on guitar and Phil Collins on drums. As with all Marillion albums and singles of the Fish period, the cover art was created by Mark Wilkinson. The b-side on the international version, \"Lady Nina\", would go on to be used as a single promoting the 1986 US-only mini album Brief Encounter. \"Lady Nina\" is the only Marillion song from the Fish era to use a drum machine. The US version of the single uses \"Heart of Lothian\" instead, another track from Misplaced Childhood that would eventually be released as the third and final single from the album. A CD replica of the single was also part of a collectors box-set released in July 2000 which contained Marillion's first twelve singles and was re-issued as a 3-CD set in 2009 (see The Singles '82\u2013'88)."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"Movin' Out (Anthony's Song)\" is a song written and recorded by Billy Joel. The track details the singer's disgust with the upwardly-mobile bourgeois aspirations of working- and lower-middle-class New Yorkers who take pride in working long hours to afford the outward signs of having \"made it\". Characters have stereotypically ethnic names (Anthony, Mama Leone, Sergeant O'Leary, Mr. Cacciatore) and blue-collar jobs. Joel considers their rejection of their working-class roots (trading a Chevy for a Cadillac and buying a house in Hackensack, New Jersey) ultimately futile; in the end, the rewards are a \"heart attack\" or \"a broken back\". Near the end of the recording is the sound of a car starting up and driving away; the bass player Doug Stegmeyer's 1960s Corvette was used. In the single mix the engine sound was removed. According to Joel, Anthony isn't a real person, but rather \"every Irish, Polish, and Italian kid trying to make a living in the U.S.\" \"Movin' Out\" originally appeared on Joel's 1977 album The Stranger. A live performance of it can be heard on 2000 Years: The Millennium Concert."@en ;

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Train_Kept_A-Rollin\u0027>	rdf:type	dbo:MusicalWork ;
	dbo:abstract	"\"Train Kept A-Rollin'\" (or \"The Train Kept A-Rollin'\") is a song first recorded by American jazz and rhythm and blues musician Tiny Bradshaw in 1951. Originally performed in the style of a jump blues, it has been reworked into a \"classic guitar riff song for the ages\". Bradshaw borrowed lyrics from an earlier song and set them to an upbeat shuffle arrangement that inspired other musicians to perform and record it. Johnny Burnette and the Rock and Roll Trio made an important contribution in 1956 \u2013 they added a prominent three-note minor key repeating guitar line to the song, which features an early use of intentionally distorted guitar in rock music. In 1965, the Yardbirds popularized the song as an early psychedelic blues rock song, due largely to Jeff Beck's fuzz-toned guitar work. Theirs soon became the most copied arrangement with recordings by a variety of musicians. After guitarist Jimmy Page joined the group, the Yardbirds recorded an updated version with new lyrics as \"Stroll On\" for the film Blowup in 1966. With a highly charged rhythm section and a dual lead guitar attack by Beck and Page, it is seen as a forerunner to heavy metal. When the Yardbirds broke up in 1968, \"Train Kept A-Rollin'\" was adopted as a concert opener by Page's new band, Led Zeppelin, during its early (and again later) touring years. The song also became an important part of Aerosmith's early live repertoire and in 1974, they recorded it for their second album. Their version is actually a two-part song \u2013 the first has a slower, groove-oriented arrangement, while the second uses that of the Yardbirds. Aerosmith turned it into a hard rock standard and a staple of classic rock radio; it remains one of their most popular tunes. \"Train Kept A-Rollin'\" has been performed and recorded by numerous other artists."@en ;

It remains their highest charting single worldwide, reaching number two in the UK Singles Chart, behind Shakira's \"Beautiful Liar\", number one in the UK Indie Chart, number one in Canada, number four in the Netherlands and number 28 in Italy. This song was No. 62 on MTV Asia's list of Top 100 Hits of 2007. It was also used on The Colbert Report, The Daily Show and Late Night with Conan O'Brien during the final weeks of the 07-08 Writers Guild strike, in which it is played during a showdown between the three. The track is featured in the rhythm video game Guitar Hero 5, and it is considered to be one of the hardest tracks on drums due to its sporadic tom-tom beats."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"Case of the Ex\" is a song by American recording artist M\u00FDa. It was written and composed by Christopher \"Tricky\" Stewart and his songwriting partners Traci Hale and Thabiso \"Tab\" Nkhereanyne for Harrison's second studio album Fear of Flying (2000). Originally a rap song, the lyrics of the upbeat R&B track were inspired by a relationship Hale was going through at the time. It was released as the second single from the album following \"The Best of Me\". The song received generally mixed reviews from contemporary music critics and was Harrison's breakthrough hit, both stateside and internationally. \"Case of the Ex\" became a top five hit the US Billboard Hot 100 for the week of December 2, 2000; peaking and spending three consecutive weeks at number two. Internationally, the single became a Top 20 hit globally; topping the chart in Australia for the week of March 18, 2001 for two consecutive weeks and peaking at number three in the United Kingdom. The accompanying music video for the single was directed by Diane Martel. Harrison worked with choreographer Tina Landon, who later won an American Choreography Award for Best Hip Hop music video. The video drew comparisons to Janet Jackson's music video for \"You Want This\" (1994) and Mel Gibson's 1979 film Mad Max. In addition, the video was nominated for a Washington Area Music Award for Video of the Year, while the song itself won in the Urban Contemporary Recording category in 2001."@en ;

Written by Stefani and English pianist Tim Rice-Oxley, the song was released in Europe as the album's fifth and final single on January 18, 2008 by Interscope Records. Musically, \"Early Winter\" is a soft rock and synthpop ballad with new wave influences. Critics found it similar to songs by English alternative rock band Keane. The lyrics of the song describe the nearing of the end of a relationship, and were speculated to be references to Stefani's own relationship with husband Gavin Rossdale. Upon its release, \"Early Winter\" received generally positive reviews from music critics, many of whom commended Stefani's vocal delivery and the song's emotional appeal. The song charted on only a few record charts, but performed well in Germany and Slovakia, where it peaked at number six on the singles and airplay chart, respectively. An accompanying music video for \"Early Winter\" was directed by Sophie Muller and was filmed in destinations like Budapest, Milan, and Prague. It contains scenes of Stefani in a palace-like hall in various gowns and at railway stations. \"Early Winter\" was included in the setlist of The Sweet Escape Tour, and the performances featured a special coda section delivered by American musician and bassist Gail Ann Dorsey."@en ;

It was written by Swedish composers Hans Andersson and Niklas Pettersson and produced by songwriter Peter Ries for the band's debut studio album, Elle'ments, released in March 2001. An anthemic song about self-empowerment, the track combines elements of gospel music and eurodance with prominent usage of a piano sample. The composition was released as the album's second single in German-speaking Europe on April 30, 2001 (see 2001 in music) upon the major success of debut single \"Daylight in Your Eyes.\" The song reached the top ten in Germany and Switzerland. This however, made \"Rivers of Joy\" the lowest-charting single of the Elle'ments era, as both singles of the reissue charted significantly higher. An accompanying music video for \"Rivers of Joy\" was directed by Robert Br\u00F6llochs and filmed in Gro\u00DF-Gerau, Germany in early April 2001.

It was written by Amy Lee and Terry Balsamo while the production was handled by Dave Fortman. \"All That I'm Living For\" was initially planned to be the third single, as announced at live concerts and online. However, due to requests from the band and fan reaction, Wind-up reconsidered its release and announced that \"Sweet Sacrifice\" would be the band's third single from The Open Door. Evanescence's lead singer Amy Lee wrote the song about the abusive relationship that inspired all of the songs on the group's debut record Fallen (2003). \"Sweet Sacrifice\" is a rock song written in a moderate tempo. Several critics found a metaphor to Evanescence's former guitarist Ben Moody in the song. Upon its release, \"Sweet Sacrifice\" received mostly positive reviews by critics; many deemed the song as a highlight on the album and praised Lee's vocals, which some described as \"haunting\". Although the song failed to chart as highly as the band's previous singles, it appeared on the charts in Turkey and Germany, as well as the Billboard Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks chart. \"Sweet Sacrifice\" was nominated in the category for Best Hard Rock Performance at the 50th Grammy Awards. A music video for the song, directed by Paul R. Brown, was filmed in California between March 9 and March 10, 2007; It contained mostly live performances and was compared with the film, The Cell (2000). \"Sweet Sacrifice\" was also added on the set-list on Evanescence's The Open Door Tour."@en ;

dbr:Teardrops_on_My_Guitar	rdf:type	dbo:MusicalWork ;
	dbo:abstract	"\"Teardrops on My Guitar\" is a song by American country pop singer-songwriter Taylor Swift. The song was co-written by Swift, alongside Liz Rose and produced by Nathan Chapman with Swift's aid. \"Teardrops on My Guitar\" was released on February 19, 2007 by Big Machine Records, as the second single from Swift's eponymous debut studio album (2006). The song was later included on the international release of Swift's second studio album, Fearless (2008), and released as the second pop single from the album in the United Kingdom. It was inspired by Swift's experience with Drew Hardwick, a classmate of hers for whom she had feelings. He was completely unaware and continually spoke about his girlfriend to Swift, something she pretended to be endeared by. Years afterwards, Hardwick appeared at Swift's house, but Swift rejected him. Musically, the track is soft and is primarily guided by a gentle acoustic guitar. Critics have queried the song's classification as country music, with those in agreement (such as Grady Smith of Rolling Stone) citing the themes and narrative style as country-influenced and those opposed (such as Roger Holland of Popmatters) indicating the pop music production and instrumentation lack traditional country elements. Critics received the track generally positively, complimenting Swift's vocal delivery and songwriting style. The song is considered to be Swift's breakthrough single, as it spread her popularity throughout the United States. \"Teardrops on My Guitar\" was commercially successful, peaking at number 13 on the Billboard Hot 100, becoming the best-charting single from Taylor Swift on the chart, and being Swift's debut entry on the Billboard Year-End Hot 100 charts. The single was also certified triple platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). Its music video was directed by Trey Fanjoy and features Swift as she sees her love interest develop a relationship with another female. The video received a nomination for MTV Video Music Award for Best New Artist, but lost to Tokio Hotel's music video for \"Ready, Set, Go!\". The song was promoted through multiple live performances, some while supporting as opening act for various country artists' concert tours. She also performed \"Teardrops on My Guitar\" on her first headlining tour, the Fearless Tour (2009\u201310)."@en ;

The song was released in the UK as the third single from Yours Truly, Angry Mob on 20 August 2007. The song discusses the way in which the media encourage knee-jerk reactionary thinking, and the idea that society at large keeps people under control via the tabloids and 24-hour drinking culture. The video was first shown at 23:00 on 23 July 2007 on Channel 4. It depicts the working-class hen-night culture and culminates in two separate hen parties coming together in a \"gang war\" style fight after they have been banned from a high-class restaurant 'NOBLESSE' at the request of the upper middle-class diners. The diners gather at the window to enjoy the spectacle of the two groups that have turned on each other, however the hens then decide to unite to confront the diners instead. The video was directed by W.I.Z. The single came with special artwork created by Dandy/Beano artist Nigel Parkinson, and features caricatures of the band with various Beano characters. A limited 7\" single containing an exclusive Beano poster, was only available through the Kaiser Chiefs website Despite only reaching #22 in the UK Singles Chart (the lowest peaking single by the band since the original release of \"I Predict a Riot\"), it has received significant airplay on contemporary radio stations."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"You're the One For Me\" (Hindi: Haan Main Tumhara Hoon) is a song written by Australian cricketer Brett Lee during the 2006 ICC Champions Trophy in India. It was released as a duet featuring Lee and Bollywood star Asha Bhosle. The lyrics were reportedly written in 30 minutes by Lee between practice sessions at the Champions Trophy. The song tells the story of a westerner, played in the video clip by Brett Lee, trying to woo a young Indian woman. Asha Bhosle plays the role of an advisor, teaching him Hindi in order to impress the girl. Lee, who plays in a band known as \"Six & Out\" with some New South Wales teammates, plays guitar and sings in English as well as in Hindi. Like many Indian songs, \"You're the One for Me\" has a distinct Bollywood flavour, visible both in the musical style of the piece and the arrangement of the video clip."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"All These Things I Hate (Revolve Around Me)\" is a rock ballad in the pop metal vein, produced by the Welsh heavy metal band Bullet for My Valentine. The song was released as the third single from the band's debut album The Poison, through Sony BMG Recordings on 3 February 2006 in Germany and released in United Kingdom through Visible Noise on 7 February 2006. The band originally recorded the song on their 2003 Jeff Killed John EP. Stylus Magazine said that the song \"doesn't work\" on The Poison album because its \"quiet/loud dynamic\" does not explore the full dynamic. Music Emissions gave the song a very positive review, saying that it was the highlight of an otherwise \"gimmicky\" album, the song featuring interwoven acoustic guitar lines and harmony vocals (delivered by lead singer Matthew Tuck) during the song's introduction section. Punk News reviewed the song as \"a nice respite from the [otherwise] drab\" songs on the album, because of its acoustic intro."@en ;

While the rest of the album is filled with covers of songs by earlier artists such as Marvin Gaye and Depeche Mode, \"War Drums\" is often regarded as a remix of \"Pet\", from the previous album, Thirteenth Step. However, on the aMOTION DVD commentary, Maynard James Keenan states that it is a second part of \"Pet\", a continuation. While the former refers to addiction, \"War Drums\" focuses on a political agenda. Mixed by Danny Lohner, the music is completely electronic and without any guitars, unlike \"Pet\". The song was used in numerous trailers and tv spots for movies, tv shows and video games including Fantastic Four, The Taking of Pelham 123, Rage, Missing, Gotham and House of Cards (U.S. TV series) in addition to the promo for UFC 167: St-Pierre vs Hendricks PPV."@en ;

Written by musicians Keith Crouch and Kipper Jones, with production helmed by the former, it was released on September 6, 1994 by the Atlantic Recording Corporation. The song is a mid\u2013tempo track that features a thunderous beat and light synth riffs. Lyrically, \"I Wanna Be Down\" describes a flirt with a boy, who Norwood tries to convince of her charms. The song's music video was filmed by Keith Ward and released in October 1994. It features Norwood in her tomboy image, dancing in front of a jeep near a forest, flanked by several dancers. \"I Wanna Be Down\" was performed on several television and award show ceremonies, such as The Tonight Show with Jay Leno, the 1996 Soul Train Music Awards, and the 2014 BET Hip Hop Awards. It has been performed on almost every one of Norwood's concerts and tours, and is featured on the compilation album The Best of Brandy (2005). \"I Wanna Be Down\" was released to positive reaction by contemporary music critics. Its impact on the charts was comparatively large for a debut single: While it spent four weeks on top of the US Billboard Hot R&B Singles chart, it reached number six on the Billboard Hot 100, and the top 20 in Australia and New Zealand. In 1995, a hip hop remix with new vocals from American rappers MC Lyte, Queen Latifah, and Yo-Yo was released."@en ;

dbr:See_My_Friends	rdf:type	dbo:MusicalWork ;
	dbo:abstract	"\"See My Friends\" is a song by The Kinks, written by the group's singer and guitarist, Ray Davies. Released in 1965, it reached #10 on the UK Singles Chart. A rare foray into psychedelic rock for the group, it is credited by Jonathan Bellman as the first Western rock song to integrate Indian raga sounds, being released four months before the Beatles' \"Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown)\". The song is sometimes mistitled \"See My Friend\", because this is how the song was identified on the initial UK single pressing. However, the website of Kassner Music, which owns the publishing rights to the song, specifies the title as \"See My Friends\", which are also the words Davies clearly sings throughout the track. Most subsequent issues of the song have borne the more familiar \"See My Friends\" title. Ray Davies has been heard to say the song is about the death of his older sister, Rene, who lived for a time in Ontario, Canada. Upon her return to England she fell ill due to an undiagnosed hole in her heart and died while dancing at a night club. Just before she died, he has said, she gave him his first guitar for his 13th birthday. Inspiration for the song came from a stopover in Bombay during The Kinks' 1965 Asian tour, where the jetlagged Davies encountered fishermen chanting on their way to their morning work. Ray Davies, at the time of the song's release, expressed disappointment toward the single's lukewarm reception, saying \"[It's] the only one I've really liked, and they're not buying it. You know, I put everything I've got into it ... I can't even remember what the last one [\"Set Me Free\"] was called - nothing. It makes me think they must be morons or something. Look, I'm not a great singer, nor a great writer, not a great musician. But I do give everything I have ... and I did for this disc.\" Shel Talmy who was the producer of the record \"See My Friends\" says in different interviews that the song had been inspired by Jon Mark."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"Sittin' Up in My Room\" is a song by American recording artist Brandy Norwood. It was written and produced by Babyface and recorded by Norwood for the soundtrack of the 1995 film Waiting to Exhale, starring Whitney Houston and Angela Bassett. The track was one out of five singles the album spawned and reached number two on the US Billboard Hot 100, becoming Norwood's most successful single on that particular chart up to that point. It is of note that the characteristic bass intro is a replica of the famous riff performed by bassist Larry Graham, of Sly and the Family Stone, on their hit \"Thank You (Falettinme Be Mice Elf Agin)\". \"Sittin' Up in My Room\" was performed on several television and award show ceremonies, such as Late Show with David Letterman, the 23rd Annual American Music Awards, the 1996 Soul Train Awards, the 39th Annual Grammy Awards, and the 2015 Soul Train Music Awards. A music video was also filmed, depicting Brandy keeping herself penned up in a retro, brightly-colored room after her friend tells her that her love interest is joining the party downstairs. Actor Donald Faison appears as her love interest in the video, directed by Hype Williams. It was nominated for Best Song from a Movie and Best Video from a Film at the 1996 MTV Awards."@en ;

The group admitted that the video was not their best, due to time restraints. \"Something Kinda Ooooh\" was promoted through numerous live appearances and has since been performed on each one of Girls Aloud's subsequent concert tours. Described as \"a welcome return to a tune which gets you moving\", the song received praise from contemporary music critics."@en .

The song was sent to country radio in the United States on November 15, 2010, as the second single from Speak Now. According to Swift, \"Back to December\" is the first time she ever apologizes to someone in a song. Critics speculate that the song is about Taylor Lautner, Swift's ex-boyfriend, although neither Swift nor Lautner have commented on these allegations. \"Back to December\" is considered an orchestral country pop ballad and its lyrics are a remorseful plea for forgiveness for breaking up with a former lover. \"Back to December\" received positive reviews from critics, who regarded it as one of the highlights of Speak Now. Critics have praised the song for its expressive lyrics, its indelible melody, and Swift's vocal improvement. The song enjoyed commercial success, peaking at number six on the United States Billboard Hot 100, and at number seven in Canada. It also peaked at number three on the Billboard Hot Country Songs. The song received moderate success internationally, peaking at number 24 in New Zealand, and number 26 in Australia. The song's accompanying music video, directed by Yoann Lemoine, laments the aftermath of a break-up between Swift and her boyfriend. The music video garnered mixed to positive reviews from critics; some praised the spectacular visual sense in portraying the somber mood while others criticized its inadequate narrative. Swift has performed \"Back to December\" in several live appearances, notably at the 44th annual Country Music Association Awards and at the 38th American Music Awards."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"End of Time\" is a song recorded by American singer Beyonc\u00E9 for her fourth studio album, 4 (2011). It was written by Knowles, Terius \"The-Dream\" Nash, Shea Taylor and David \"Switch\" Taylor while its production was handled by Knowles, Nash and Taylor. Initially rumored to be titled \"Till the End of Time\", a demo of the song leaked online on May 20, 2011, giving rise to speculation that the song was a potential follow-up to the lead single, \"Run the World (Girls)\" (2011). However, \"Best Thing I Never Had\" was ultimately chosen as the second single. In February 2012, it was announced through Knowles' website that \"End of Time\" will be the fifth and final single from 4. It was sent to contemporary hit radio stations in the United Kingdom on April 23, 2012. An uptempo R&B, dance and funk song, \"End of Time\" exhibits the influence of late Nigerian music legend Fela Kuti; its bass line was inspired by the multi-instrumentalist's work. Also displaying elements of Afrobeat, the song's instrumentation includes marching band drums, percussion and horns. The high energy level provided by its instrumentation has similarities to several songs by Michael Jackson from the Off the Wall era (1979\u201380). \"End of Time\" was lauded by music critics, who coined it as one of highlights on 4 thanks to Knowles' boldness and its dance beat that makes the song a catchy one. Critics also commended the uplifting lyrics and Knowles' confident vocal delivery. Following the release of 4, \"End of Time\" charted at number 62 on the UK Singles Chart and at number 20 on its R&B Chart, based solely on downloads. It also opened at number 26 on the South Korea Gaon International Singles Chart. The song performed poorly in the U.S., peaking at number 13 on the US Billboard Bubbling Under Hot 100 chart. The song was part of Knowles' set list for her 4 Intimate Nights with Beyonc\u00E9, Revel Presents: Beyonc\u00E9 Live and The Mrs. Carter World Tour revues; critics generally agreed that the song sounds great when performed live, and showed much appreciation for the choreography."@en ;

However, it also incorporates elements of other genres, particularly pop music with the Loredana Groza-sung chorus and arabic music, using various ethnic instruments in its instrumental production. Lyrically, the song is largely about the social situation in modern-day Romania and about how the group's members feel frustrated when dealing with day-to-day hardship and violence. Due to the song's instrumental being leaked onto the Internet several months in advance to its release, it was a significant commercial success on its official release, particularly in the Romania, where it quickly rose to local music charts just days after being released."@en ;

The song reached #10 on the Billboard Hot Country Singles & Tracks chart. Co-written by her husband, Jon Vezner, and Don Henry, the song is about two lovers, Edwin and Claire. It uses three interpretations of the phrase \"where've you been\", all spoken by Claire toward Edwin in various situations. In the first verse, she asks him where he has been all her life; in the second, she asks him where he has been after coming home late one night; and in the third, the two are elderly hospital patients: Claire has \"lost her memory\" of family and friends, and close to death, asks Edwin upon seeing him, \"where've you been\". Edwin and Claire are based on Vezner's own grandparents, as Vezner claims to have witnessed his grandparents having an encounter similar to the elderly encounter of Edwin and Claire. The song won the Grammy Award for Best Country Song in 1990. Kathy Mattea was awarded the Grammy award for Best Country Performance, Female for her recording."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"Europe After The Rain\" is the title of a John Foxx song, released as a single in August 1981, and included on The Garden album released later the same year. The song signalled a departure from Foxx's previous solo work which had focused on a sparse electronic sound whereas Europe After The Rain features a warmer sound, using acoustic and electric guitars, acoustic piano and live drums to produce the music. The bass and string sounds were however produced by a synthesiser. Foxx has several times stated that this change in musical direction was caused by a visit to Italy after the Metamatic period, where he worked with director Michaelangelo Antonioni for the soundtrack of his film Identification of a Woman. Although the single only reached no. 40 in the UK Singles Chart, Foxx performed the song on UK music show Top of the Pops where Foxx's new more romantic style was presented in the clothes and setting to accompany the performance in stark contrast to that of \"Underpass\" on the same show some eighteen months previously. For this performance Foxx was seen playing acoustic guitar, flanked by three other musicians on piano and keyboards. These musicians were Eddie and Sunshine and Duncan Bridgeman of the band Shake Shake, who had collaborated with Foxx in writing B-side \"A Long Time\" in 1980. The Top of the Pops footage was issued officially for the first time in 2013, on the DVD of the artist's Metadelic collection. No video was made for the single."@en ;

The re-release was eventually withdrawn in favour of a brand new studio album, with \"A Moment Changes Everything\" being released as the lead single. The song in its full length version was added to the Music Player on David Gray's website in mid-June. Gray says of the song: \"I don't have fond feelings for it,\" Gray confesses. \"I was contacted about doing some music for a [soccer] tournament a few years ago, and this was my stab on it based on the brief I was given. Unfortunately it got used on the telly and then people heard of it, and when anybody thinks there's any chance of a hit record at radio they just won't let go of the damn thing. So it got let out of the cupboard, and it's ended up on this bonus disc...It's just one of those throwaway moments that other people seize upon.

	dbo:abstract	"\"Assassing\" is a song by the British neo-progressive rock band Marillion. It was the second single from their second studio album, Fugazi (1984). The single reached no. 22 on the UK singles charts in May 1984. The 7\" single's title track is a heavily edited version of the first track on Fugazi, with a length of 03:39 as opposed to the album version with 07:01. The B-side is the non-album track \"Cinderella Search\". The lyrics of the song, which feature a narrator-character describing himself as an assassin, appear to concern character assassination. The lyrics are full of metaphors alluding to verbal fighting, for example, \"unsheath the blade within the voice.\" The lyrics are generally interpreted as a reference to the verbal arguments that preceded band founder and drummer Mick Pointer's departure from the band. The international 12\" version contains both the full album version and the edited version of the title track; the latter is missing from the UK release. The b-side also appears in a significantly longer version. As with all Marillion albums and singles of the Fish period, the cover art was created by Mark Wilkinson. A CD replica of the single was also part of a collectors box-set released in July 2000 which contained Marillion's first twelve singles and was re-issued as a 3-CD set in 2009 (see The Singles '82\u2013'88)."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"Can't Take That Away (Mariah's Theme)\" is a song by American singer-songwriter Mariah Carey. It was released by Columbia Records on June 6, 2000, written by Carey and Diane Warren, and produced by Carey and Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis for Carey's seventh studio album Rainbow (1999). It was released as the album's third single as a double A-side with \"Crybaby\". The song is a ballad, blending pop and R&B beats while incorporating its sound from several instruments including the violin, piano and organ. Lyrically, the song speaks of inner strength, and not allowing others to tear away your dreams. The song was well received by critics, many of whom complimented the lyrics, as well as Carey's vocals. The song was not commercially successful due to its limited release and other factors. The song was the center of a very public controversy between Carey and her label Sony Music, based on what she perceived to be weak promotion of the single. It peaked at number 40 in Belgium Wallonia, number 45 in Italy and number 65 in the Netherlands. Stateside, due to Billboard rules at the time, it was not eligible to chart on the Hot 100, only managing a peak of number six on the dance chart. Two music videos were filmed for \"Can't Take That Away (Mariah's Theme)\". Both feature personal videos left by five fans, re-telling their stories of pain and emotional abuse and how the song had inspired them. Additionally, a large screen is shown next to Carey throughout the video, playing other inspirational stories from famous athletes. The ending alternates in both videos, with one climaxing on the balcony overlooking the city, while the other by a large indoor window. The song was performed on The Today Show and The View, as well as Carey's Rainbow (2000) and Charmbracelet World Tours (2002\u201303)."@en ;

The song's propelled by a strong bass line and contains live drums and handclaps. A raunchy guitar solo provides a rock element to the funky track. \"Get It Up\" is basically an ode to sex and Day's attempts to get some. Prince's vocals are very apparent in the song, both in the background and the lead at times. \"Get It Up\" was only released as a 7\" single with the poppy \"After Hi School\" as its B-side. \"After Hi School\", while not an outstanding effort was composed by Dez Dickerson and is perhaps the strongest pop effort on the album. The full version of \"Get It Up\" was later a B-side for the 12\" single of \"Ice Cream Castles\" in 1984. \"Get It Up\" is one of The Time's more popular numbers, and a live version of the song recorded at the House of Blues in 1998 was included on Morris Day's 2004 album, It's About Time where it segues into \"777-9311\"."@en ;

The song was released on 17 November 2013 as the lead single from Allen's third studio album Sheezus and is Allen's first original solo recording since 2010. Allen wrote the song in collaboration with Greg Kurstin, with the song's production handled by the latter. Musically, \"Hard out Here\" is a synthpop song with lyrics revolving around \"body image pressures and misogyny in the entertainment industry.\" \"Hard out Here\" was critically acclaimed; many critics praised its lyrical content and praised Allen's take on the industry, dubbing the song a \"feminist anthem through and through\". According to The Wire, the title is a \"thinly veiled reference\" to Three 6 Mafia's Academy Award-winning 2005 song \"It's Hard out Here for a Pimp\". The song charted within the top thirty of New Zealand and Ireland. To promote the song, Allen performed at YoYos pod in London. The music video for the song was directed by Christopher Sweeney and premiered on Allen's website on 12 November 2013. The video depicts Allen receiving liposuction and twerking. The video received positive reviews from most critics, but also sparked minor controversy over the ethnicity of the backing dancers."@en ;

dbr:On_the_Regular	rdf:type	dbo:MusicalWork ;
	dbo:abstract	"\"On the Regular\" is a song recorded by American musician Shamir. It was released by XL Recordings on October 28, 2014. \"On the Regular\" is also featured on Shamir's 2015 debut album Ratchet. The song features a prominent rhythm with cowbell and heavy bass. Shamir uses an androgynous falsetto, delivering rhymes in contrast to his singing on Northtown. The lyrics are an unrelated set of observations. Shamir taunts others and brags about his style. In the song's bridge, he switches from rapping to innocent, soulful singing. Music critics referenced Azealia Banks' 2011 debut single \"212\" for its bassline, dance beat, and playful reinvention of urban music. The Fader likened the song's \"bubblegum hip-hop\" to a younger-sounding Leif. It had viral success in the United Kingdom, and it reached number 36 on the Billboard Twitter Emerging Artists chart. The attention brought by \"On the Regular\" allowed Shamir to embark on a European tour in late 2014. It placed 68th on the 2014 Pazz & Jop poll of music critics. Pitchfork Media named it the 11th best track of 2014, Drowned in Sound placed the song 18th on its year-end list, and BlackBook magazine ranked the song 12th. The music video for \"On the Regular\" was directed by Anthony Sylvester. It shows Shamir with different hairstyles, flashy patterns, and a fringe jacket. He plays with a rubber band gun and makes balloons burst into color."@en ;

dbr:One_Better_Day	rdf:type	dbo:MusicalWork ;
	dbo:abstract	"\"One Better Day\" is a song by British band Madness from their 1984 album Keep Moving. The song was written by Graham McPherson and Mark Bedford. The song was released as a single in the UK, and spent 7 weeks in British charts peaking at number 18. The single was a last minute choice, as \"Victoria Gardens\" from the same album was originally slated to be the album's second single. The remixed version of \"Victoria Gardens\" intended for the A-side was instead included as a bonus track on the 12\" single. The substitution was likely made to avoid releasing two consecutive singles with Carl Smyth as lead vocalist, following the disappointing (by their standards) sales of \"Michael Caine\" and widespread rumours that Suggs was about to leave, or had already left, the group. This was the last single under the Stiff Records label, before the band's creation of their own label, Zarjazz Records. The B-side \"Guns\" was McPherson's first solo writing credit and meant that all seven members of the group had been credited with at least one solo composition."@en ;

It is described by Vives as a romantic song with elements of Colombian vallenato and pop music. \"Volv\u00ED a Nacer\" was both a critical and commercial success where it peaked at number one in Colombia, Mexico, Venezuela, and on the Billboard Hot Latin Songs chart in the United States. The song was well received by critics who described it as the best track on the album. The success of the song led to Vives winning six Nuestra Tierra awards in his home country and two Latin Grammys for Song of the Year and Best Tropical Song. The music video for the song was directed by Carlos P\u00E9rez and filmed in Mexico."@en ;

The song, which features R&B singer Dave Hollister, is about a twelve-year-old girl named Brenda who lives in a ghetto, has a baby, and is incapable of supporting it. The song explores the issue of teen pregnancy and its effect on young mothers and their families. Like many of Shakur's songs, \"Brenda's Got a Baby\" draws from the plight of the impoverished. Using Brenda to represent young mothers in general, Shakur criticises the low level of support from the baby's father, the government, and society in general. Shakur wrote the song when he read a newspaper article about a twelve-year-old girl who became pregnant from her cousin and threw the baby in a trash compactor."@en ;

It was released as the album's fifth single overall and second commercial single on April 21, 1998 by Columbia Records. The song was written and produced by Carey and Walter Afanasieff. \"My All\" is built around Latin guitar chord melodies, and makes subtle use of Latin percussion throughout the first chorus, before taking on a more conventional contemporary R&B-style beat. Carey was inspired to write the song and use Latin inspired melodies after her trip to Puerto Rico, where she was influenced by the culture. The song's lyrics tell of a lonely woman declaring she would give \"her all\" to have just one more night with her estranged lover. The music video for the song was released in March 1998. It shows many scenes of Carey laying on a submerged vessel in a large body of water, while lamenting her lost lover. Towards the video's climax, Carey and her love interest climb atop a lighthouse and caress each other under the night's sky. \"My All\" was performed live on various occasions, including the 1998 World Music Awards and Blockbuster Entertainment Awards, Saturday Night Live, The Rosie O'Donnell Show and various European television and music chart programs. The song was also part of Carey's 1998 Butterfly World Tour, and was performed during many future tours and concerts. House music producer David Morales remixed the song, which was sung in live medley's with the original. \"My All\" was well received by contemporary music critics and charted strongly throughout various music markets. In the United States, the song became Carey's thirteenth chart topper on the Billboard Hot 100, and was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). Throughout Europe, the song performed moderately, peaking at number four in the United Kingdom and in the top ten in Belgium (Wallonia), France, Spain and Switzerland. In France, due to strong sales, the song was certified silver by the Syndicat National de l'\u00C9dition Phonographique (SNEP)."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"One Sweet Day\" is a song by American singer Mariah Carey and R&B group Boyz II Men. The song was written by Carey, Walter Afanasieff and Boyz II Men: Wanya Morris, Shawn Stockman, Nathan Morris, and Michael McCary. \"One Sweet Day\" was produced by Carey and Afanasieff for her fifth studio album, Daydream, and was released as the album's second single on November 14, 1995. The song talks about death of a loved one, how the protagonist took their presence for granted and misses them, and finally about seeing the person in heaven. Both Carey and Boyz II Men wrote the song about specific people in their lives, being inspired by sufferers of AIDS epidemic, which was globally prevalent at that time. \"One Sweet Day\" received universal acclaim from critics, many of whom praised its lyrical content and vocals, as well as calling it a standout track from Daydream. The song spent 16 weeks atop the Billboard Hot 100, and is the longest running number one song on the chart, and the most successful single by both Carey and Boyz II Men. The song also topped the charts in Canada and New Zealand, and reached the top-ten in Australia, Belgium, France, Ireland, The Netherlands, Norway, Sweden and the United Kingdom. \"One Sweet Day\" was ranked first in Rolling Stone's reader's poll for the Best Collaboration of All Time. Carey performed \"One Sweet Day\" live alongside Boyz II Men at the 38th Grammy Awards ceremony, held on February 26, 1996. Additionally, the song was performed at Princess Diana's memorial service in September 1997. \"One Sweet Day\" was part of the set list on several of Carey's succeeding tours, making its debut during the album's accompanying set of concerts, the Daydream World Tour. It is featured on her compilation albums, #1's (1998), Greatest Hits (2001), The Ballads (2008), and #1 to Infinity (2015). The music video for \"One Sweet Day\" was filmed in February 1995, and features snippets of Carey and Boyz II Men in and around the studio, and recording the song. The busy schedule of both Carey and Boyz II Men did not allow time to record a proper video. The singer later said that she was content a real music video was never filmed, fearing that no video could truly capture the song's strong lyrical message. Critics felt the video choice was wise, and agreed that the simple concept paid homage to the song's selfless message."@en ;

Written by Carey and Ben Margulies, \"Vision of Love\" was released on May 15, 1990, by Columbia Records. After being featured on Carey's demo tape for Columbia, the song was re-sung and produced by Rhett Lawrence and Narada Michael Walden. \"Vision of Love\" features a slow-dance theme tempo and backing vocals sung by Carey herself, and introduces her usage of the whistle register. Lyrically, the song describes a past and present relationship with a lover. Carey describes the \"vision of love\" she dreamed of, as well as the present love she feels for him. The song's music video was filmed in April 1990. It features Carey in a large cathedral, where she meditates and sings by a large carved window. \"Vision of Love\" was performed on several television and award show ceremonies, such as The Oprah Winfrey Show, The Arsenio Hall Show and the 33rd Annual Grammy Awards. It has been performed at almost every one of Carey's concerts and tours, and is featured on Carey's live album MTV Unplugged (1992) and on many of her compilation albums, Number 1's (1998), Greatest Hits (2001) and The Ballads (2008). \"Vision of Love\" was lauded by contemporary music critics. While the production of the song was typical of late 1980s pop, the vocals were not, being much more showy and expressing a wider range than artists popular at the time such as Paula Abdul and Debbie Gibson. It has been credited with popularizing the use of melisma in modern popular music and for inspiring several artists to pursue a career in music. The New Yorker named \"Vision of Love\" the \"Magna Carta of melisma\" for its and Carey's influence on pop and R&B singers and American Idol contestants. Additionally, Rolling Stone said that \"the fluttering strings of notes that decorate songs like \"Vision of Love,\" inspired the entire American Idol vocal school, for better or worse, and virtually every other female R&B singer since the nineties.\" The song topped the singles charts in Canada, New Zealand and the United States, where it spent four weeks atop the chart."@en ;

The release of this single coincided with the release of the album A Day Without Rain. In 2001, \"Only Time\" was released again as a remix. The track was remixed by the Swiss American Federation (S.A.F.) (Christian B. and Marc Dold) with a final remix by Enya's producer, Nicky Ryan. Enya donated the earnings from the sale of that single to the Uniform Firefighters Association's Widows' and Children's Fund to help the families of fire fighters in the aftermath of 9/11. The song was also featured in the soundtrack of the motion picture Sweet November. To date, \"Only Time\" is Enya's biggest solo hit in the United States, where it peaked at #10 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart and #1 on the adult contemporary chart. During the summer of 2001, NBC used the song in commercials to promote Friends, which ended its season on a cliffhanger. The exposure helped the song gain familiarity and increased radio play. As a result, the song became Enya's first top 40 radio hit in 12 years. The song appeared twice on the TV show Viva La Bam where it first appeared in the montage of Bam Margera destroying Don Vito's cars in \"Bamiature Golf\" and again in \"Where's Vito?\" during a retrospective for Bam's Hummer after it was thrown off the cliff by Vito. On November 13, 2013, a Volvo Trucks campaign featuring the song and Jean-Claude Van Damme, was launched. The success of the ad caused \"Only Time\" to re-enter the Billboard Hot 100 at #43, and the UK Singles Chart at #95. The song's music video, which shows Enya singing in the rain, was directed by Graham Fink and was released in 2000."@en ;

dbr:Spice_Up_Your_Life	rdf:type	dbo:MusicalWork ;
	dbo:abstract	"\"Spice Up Your Life\" is a song by the British pop group Spice Girls. It was written by the group members, with Matt Rowe and Richard Stannard, at the same time as the group was filming scenes for their movie Spice World. The song was produced by Rowe and Stannard for the group's second album Spiceworld, released in November 1997. \"Spice Up Your Life\" is a dance-pop song with influences of Latin rhythms such as salsa and samba. The lyrics are inspired by Bollywood films and reflects the group desire to \"write a song for the world\". The music video, directed by Marcus Nispel, features the Spice Girls in a futuristic setting, inspired by the 1982 film Blade Runner, controlling every aspect of society in a dark futuristic cityscape. The group promoted the song heavily, performing it on many television programmes and award shows. Despite the lukewarm reception from music critics, it was a commercial success. Released as the album's lead single in October 1997, it topped the UK Singles Chart on 19 October 1997 for one week, becoming the group's fifth consecutive chart-topper. This made the Spice Girls the first act to have its first five singles reach number one in the United Kingdom. It performed almost as well internationally, peaking inside the top five on the majority of the charts that it entered. In the United States, the song did not perform as well as their previous releases, peaking at number eighteen on the Billboard Hot 100."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"There's Got to Be a Way\" is a song by American singer and songwriter Mariah Carey from her self-titled debut studio album (1990). Columbia released it as the fifth and final single from the album in the United Kingdom. It was one of four songs Carey wrote with Ric Wake during their first recording session together, but \"There's Got to Be a Way\" was the only composition to make the final track listing. It is a socio-political conscious R&B-pop song which addresses the existence of poverty, racism and war in the world which gradually becomes more aspirational and positive as it progresses. The track garnered a mixed reception upon the album's release in 1990. While Carey's vocals were praised, it was seen as too political. An accompanying music video highlights social injustices. The song reached number 54 on the UK Singles Chart."@en ;

dbr:This_Place_Hotel	rdf:type	dbo:MusicalWork ;
	dbo:abstract	"\"This Place Hotel\" (originally named \"Heartbreak Hotel\") was a hit recording by The Jacksons when it was released in 1980. Written and composed by Michael (and produced by The Jacksons), the song would precede Jackson's own hit, \"Billie Jean\", in its insecurity-plagued tale of confusion. While his brothers did not sing background vocals, they were credited with playing percussion on the album while brother Tito contributed a guitar solo. The song has a tempo of 98 beats per minute, making it notably slower than many of the other disco-based songs on the album. In the song, the protagonist speaks of a time when ten years ago, he took his girlfriend to a hotel for a romantic night - only to find out that it was designed specifically to break couples up. The staff at the hotel gave the girl the impression that he had cheated on her with someone else, something he did not do, which caused her to break up with him in the hotel. The song reached number twenty-two on the Billboard pop singles chart and number two on the R&B singles chart when it was released and became the group's second biggest single off their Triumph album, behind \"Can You Feel It.\" The song, in turn, became a popular concert performance for the group's next two tours right into Michael's own Bad tour. The song, like the aforementioned \"Can You Feel It,\" has become one of the oft-sampled songs in hip-hop. The song's title was changed because of the 1956 Elvis Presley hit, \"Heartbreak Hotel\". Michael claimed to be unaware of the Presley song but had the title changed nonetheless. The song was performed on the Jacksons' Triumph Tour (thus appears on the Jacksons' subsequent live album) and was subsequently used on the Jacksons' Victory Tour. When Michael Jackson first toured as a solo act, \"This Place Hotel\" was the only Jacksons song to be used in both legs of the Bad World Tour, whereas the other songs by the group (with the exception of a medley of early Jackson 5 hits) were retired during the second leg. A spoken word and synth recording preceded the song on the first leg of the Bad tour, but for the second leg of the tour (and on the subsequent Dangerous World Tour) that recording was used as an intro to Jackson's hit \"Smooth Criminal\" instead. The song was included on Michael Jackson's The Ultimate Collection and it has been remixed on the Immortal album in 2011. A live version of the song is available on the 2012 DVD Live at Wembley July 16, 1988. On March 23, 2014, a video clip of a live performance of the song from the Victory Tour was uploaded to The Jacksons' official YouTube account."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"A Funky Space Reincarnation\" is a 1978 funk single recorded and released in 1979 by Marvin Gaye on the Tamla label. In this song, he described a parallel universe where in the future, he's a captain of a \"space bed\" and he meets a woman that reminds him of his first wife, Anna. He then tells the woman that they'd probably get \"married in June\" and tells her to \"smoke a joint from out of Venus\". The song, like many of the tracks on Here, My Dear, doesn't have a distinctive melody, hook or a chorus and was obviously inspired by the likes of funk musicians such as Parliament-Funkadelic and Earth, Wind & Fire. The song's bridge is a reprise of his song \"Anger,\" found earlier on the album. The song became a modest hit on the R&B charts, where it peaked at number twenty-three there. Marvin cut his very first music video with this song where surrounded by his band and a duo of sexy female dancers, he danced and lip-synched the song in a flashy red outfit. The song has been recently used in the advert for the Dior perfume J'adore starring Charlize Theron.

It was released as the second and final single from the album on 26 February 2007. The release was originally planned to include a two-part physical but that was cancelled due to the poor sales of Studio 1 and a fall-out between All Saints and their label Parlophone Records. \"Chick Fit\" was then released as a digital-only single instead. The song was co-written by group member Shaznay Lewis in collaboration with the song's producer Rick Nowels. It has prominent dance-pop, electropop, ska and hip hop musical characteristics. The song is lyrically influenced by feelings of feminism and infatuation. \"Chick Fit\" garnered a mainly positive response from contemporary music critics. Despite the lack of a physical release, \"Chick Fit\" achieved charting success in Slovakia where it peaked at number 26. \"Chick Fit\" was accompanied by a music video which was directed by Daniel Wolfe and released on 18 January 2007. The video features the American street dance, Krumping. All Saints performed the song on a T4 Special and Popworld, and on various other television shows and at several gigs around the United Kingdom."@en ;

The title change reflects the quote from Tchaikovsky's score that surfaces in Keith Levene's guitar part. In his autobiography, Rotten: No Irish, No Blacks, No Dogs, Lydon stated that the song was written for his mother, who had died of cancer not long before. \"I watched her die,\" he told Select in 1990. \"She was tough, my mum. She asked me to write a disco song for her funeral. This was hardly happy stuff.\" According to AllMusic, \"the song is built on a dense groove informed equally by dub and disco\" and features both \"Lydon at his most desperate and stark\" and Keith Levene \"dishing out shards of guitar that complement the rhythm one moment and then shift into horrific riffing the next.\" \"Death Disco\" was also included on the 1983 album Live in Tokyo."@en ;

It is arguably the fastest paced song they have ever recorded. It is primarily driven by bass guitar and string arrangements provided by an electric keyboard. It also includes a repetitive electric guitar riff throughout the song. The lead vocals are provided by the song's writer, Justin Hayward. John Lodge shouts the line \"England!\" twice in the song. Also, towards the end of the song, Ray Thomas provides the line \"More tea vicar?\", a phrase used by the English to acknowledge someone has flatulated. Live performances of the song often receive laughter from the audience after Thomas's line, who then makes a gesture of drinking tea with his hand. \"English Sunset\" is also the Moody Blues final single to feature founding member Ray Thomas prior to his retirement.

	dbo:abstract	"\"L'\u00C2me-stram-gram\" is a 1999 song recorded by French singer-songwriter Myl\u00E8ne Farmer. It was the lead single from her fifth studio album Innamoramento and was released on 9 March 1999. The lyrics were written by Farmer and the music was composed by Laurent Boutonnat. Musically, the song has techno and dance sonorities which marked an artistic change in the singer's career, although the rest of the album contains more pop songs. Based on a famous children's counting rhyme, the song is primarily about confidence, secret, and confession and uses the lexical field of psychoanalysis; however, the many puns and double entendres can also provide another meaning explicitly referring to sexuality. Inspired by the romantic comedy horror film A Chinese Ghost Story, the expensive eight-minute music video was shot by Hong Kong film director Ching Siu-Tung in Beijing and displays Farmer portraying twin sisters who have supernatural powers; the first being kidnapped by Chinese bandits and rescued by her sister, who dies in the process, causing the first twin to commit suicide. Farmer promoted the song by performing it on three TV shows and then singing it on two of her subsequent tours. The single peaked at number two in France and was certified as silver for having over 125,000 sales. It was also a top ten hit in Belgium (Wallonia)."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"\"My Songs Know What You Did in the Dark (Light Em Up)\" is a song written and recorded by American rock band Fall Out Boy, released as the lead single for their fifth studio album, Save Rock and Roll. It serves as the band's first single following their three-year hiatus and regrouping in early 2013. The track and its music video were released on February 4, 2013 worldwide and February 5, 2013 in North America, to coincide with the official news of the band's reformation. The band felt that the song best represented their album at its core. The song's title and principal lyric originate from an unrelated 2004 demo by the band. Fall Out Boy performed \"My Songs Know What You Did in the Dark (Light Em Up)\" on Jimmy Kimmel Live! for their first post-hiatus TV performance on February 13 as well as on various TV shows throughout the entire year, and have extensively played it in acoustic version at radio interviews. Lead vocalist/guitarist Patrick Stump performed the song as a guest on Taylor Swift's Red Tour on July 13, 2013, and Swift guested in turn with Fall Out Boy on Victoria's Secret Fashion Show on November 13, 2013. The song became a staple at several sports-broadcasting soundtracks that year. The music video is part 1 of The Young Blood Chronicles, a series in which a video was eventually recorded for every song on Save Rock and Roll as part of a narrative. \"My Songs Know What You Did in the Dark (Light Em Up)\" was a comeback success, reaching the 2 million digital downloads mark in July 2013, being the fourth song by Fall Out Boy to do so, and was certified 3x Platinum by the end of the year. It was named by BBC Radio 1 as one of the \"Top 100 Tracks of the Past 5 Years\" and No. 1 on Sirius XM Hits 1's best of 2013 countdown. It reached the top 10 on both Pop Songs and Alternative Songs with heavy airplay, and peaked at No. 13 on the Billboard Hot 100 with twelve consecutive weeks in the top 20."@en ;

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Wham_Rap!_(Enjoy_What_You_Do)>	rdf:type	dbo:MusicalWork ;
	dbo:abstract	"\"Wham Rap! (Enjoy What You Do)\" is a 1982 song by British pop duo Wham! on Innervision Records. It was written by Wham! members George Michael and Andrew Ridgeley. Although rap was still an underground and almost exclusively American phenomenon in the early 1980s, as the title implies, Michael rapped a number of verses about the joys of living every day to the fullest, reveling in unemployment and celebrating government assistance from the Department of Health and Social Security (the initials \"DHSS\" are repeatedly chanted during the song). The explicitly political song flew in the face of the conventional British left-wing who were talking about the 'Right to work' at the time. The chorus asked the question \"Do you enjoy what you do?\", which brought about the bracketed section of the title. The video depicted Michael and Ridgeley in their leather jackets, combining their moody image with a bright, effervescent choreography. The song, which had been tentatively released in June 1982 when Wham! were unknowns and failed to make any impact, was re-issued in January 1983 after the duo had achieved their breakthrough with \"Young Guns (Go for It!)\". It subsequently reached #8 in the UK Singles Chart, the second of four hits from Wham!'s debut album Fantastic. Uncharacteristically for Wham!, the Unsocial Mix of the song contains multiple repetitions of the swear words 'bullshit' and 'shit'. All versions include 'don't need this crap'. These lines were included to illustrate the band's then rebellious image, and future songs by Wham! would mostly refrain from using this type of language (although \"Battlestations\" does include an instance of 'bullshit'). Both the Social Mix and the Fantastic album version have different verses to the Unsocial Mix, thus there are three different sets of verse lyrics altogether. However, only the album version has appeared on CD. A new remix of the song was made in 1986, combining some of the Unsocial Mix with the album version. This version, entitled \"Wham! Rap '86\", was released on their US/Canada/Japanese album Music from the Edge of Heaven, and as the B-Side to \"The Edge Of Heaven\" in the UK and Europe. The original version of the song was used for the 1985 film drama Perfect, from James Bridges, with John Travolta and Jamie Lee Curtis."@en ;
